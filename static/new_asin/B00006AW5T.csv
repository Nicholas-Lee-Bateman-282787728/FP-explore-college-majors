1739761,5,B00006AW5T,"OK, I'm an Indian and like many other indians I too love this movie and so you might think this is an biased review. But far from it,as even though its been 10 years since this movie was released ,no hindi movie has since come close to matching this ones greatness. I'm sure Indian readers won't be needing this review, so I will write this review for the Western readers.

For starters all hindi movies are musicals, i.e they involve song and dance numbers. I do not know why, but it has always been this way. So if you like musicals you will fall in love with this movie as the music is top notch and excellently choreographed and blends in well very well with the situation.

This is a love story to begin with and a very good one, that too. Though the storyline is familiar, boy falls in love with a girl, girl's dad is the pain in the butt,boy tries hard to win the girl  and finally wins over the girl :), what sets this movie apart is the sizzling chemistry between SRK and Kajol and honest performances from the entire star cast. And I guess what appealed to the masses is that unlike in other movies, the hero does NOT run away with the girl nor does he use violence as means to justify his love for the girl. So then how does he win the girl ? Well for that you will have to watch the entire movie. So come and fall in love with the movie.",1115510400,117,1349,4.141221374045801
1739762,4,B00006AW5T,"Now, first off let me say that I am one of the harshest critics around.  It's been years since I last saw a movie I even remotely liked.

But for some strange reason, I adore this movie.  (And embarassingly, I must admit that I've seen it about 20 times in less than a month)

The acting is perfect for the goofiness that is this movie, the cinematography is solid and is especially nice during the dance numbers, the songs are catchy and fluffy, and the script... well, let's just say that it's a 'chick flick'.

For an american with no hindustani blood, this provided a funny outlook on a different culture (I'm sure it's not an accurate representation - because Hollywood is far from America!).  I could relate to the characters because in all honesty who hasn't dreamed of falling in love and having that love conquer all?

DDLJ brings nothing new to the genre, but it uses all the cliches with such finesse that you can't help but sit back and enjoy the movie.  For a measure on the cheese factor, it reminds me somewhat of Grease.  Not in the plot, but in the mood.

Highly recommended for those who like musicals, love stories, and cheesy fluff.",1097020800,29,1152,4.4951923076923075
1739763,5,B00006AW5T,"This is such a great film!  My husband and I caught it when it was shown on TCM's Bollywood night last year.  If you love musicals and are curious about seeing a Bollywood movie, you should make this the first one you watch.  The acting is cheesey at times but when there are heartfelt emotional scenes, the acting is top notch.  Its easy to see that this was (and still is) a hit.  The movie is a little on the long side but when you get into the movie, the time flies and is worth the time you spent watching it.",1094947200,32,514,4.0495049504950495
1739764,5,B00006AW5T,"I loved this movie.  It was so so good.  It stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, shall i say more.  Anything with these actors is nothing more than perfect.  This movie was made when they were really young and just started to break out into film. Its amazing what love can do to two really really diffrent people.  I was crying and laughing at the same time, Its sooo great you cant describe with words how good it is, you have to see it to truly appreciate how great it really is. The movie is about two people, who are as diffrent as Fire and Ice, and some how they end up falling in love.  It just doesnt end at love, there is so much more ahead they are faced with.  One being the father......  The movie may seem a bit fake in the end... but keep in mind that this was made a while ago!!!  Awesome Awesome Movie,  I recomend it highly!!!!!! Its one of my faves!!!!",1063584000,6,864,4.089285714285714
1739775,5,B00006AW5T,"Have read that this still plays in India, can understand why. Shahrukh was so cute in his 20's which I believe helped make this a hit plus the songs. Loved every minute of it. Hard to imagine it was over 3 hours long.",1508284800,,217,4.069767441860465

1739777,5,B00006AW5T,"Charming vintage SRK and Kajol. Lovely work by both actors, with the sparks flying between them as they always do. SRK is surprisingly cool in this film, even though it is one of his earlier pieces. The cool tough as nails guy he was destined to become can be seen peeking through the curtains of this romantic comedy.",1504396800,,318,4.5
1739778,5,B00006AW5T,"Simran (Kajol) lives in London and is betrothed to the son of her father's best friend in Punjab.  The summer before she is to be married, she takes a European rail vacation with friends, and meets Raj (Shah Rukh Khan).  They don't realize that they have fallen in love until they have parted.  Raj then follows Simran to India, determined to win her father's approval for their marriage.

In this romantic comedy/drama, family values and respect for elders is placed in high regard, even while portraying that the most hardened of hearts must be softened in the face of true love.  Both Kajol and Khan are excellent in their roles, maturing their characters perfectly.  The supporting cast is stellar.  While there is no breath-taking choreography, the songs are lovely and memorable.  The costumes, cinematography, locations, and sets are all beautifully done.  Overall, this is a funny, sweet, and serious movie that is a must-watch for any Bollywood fan.",1503446400,,958,5.012658227848101

I've watched many movies, in my life, but, I've yet to see such magical chemistry, between the hero, Raj, played by Shah Rukh Khan, and the heroine, Simran, played by the beautiful Kajol, as seen between these 2 actors, in DDLJ.  They both light up the screen together.  There is an amazing supportive cast.  The script was excellent, as well as the music and dance, all of which draws the viewer in, to support and cheer for these two star crossed lovers.  The film was seamlessly perfect, and I say that about very few films.  I just wish there would have been a DDLJ part 2.

1739893,4,B00006AW5T,"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (the ""Passionate One Will Carry Off the Bride"" or DDLJ for short) is the longest-running film in Indian history and one of the most beloved.  It's the movie that made Kajol, and Shah Rhuk Khan stars and inspired years of homages and references.

And it's pretty good.

The plot is very very Indian.  A boy and girl meet on a trip through Europe and after initially hating each other fall in love.  But she is already arranged to be married so they part ways.  But he doesn't give up, he shows up at her wedding making friends with her father and fiance until finally all involved agree to let her marry the man she loves.

So it's a very western story about marrying the one you love, but in a very Indian context.  Khan won't marry her without her family's permission.

Splashed throughout are some very elaborate and fun dance numbers.  Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane for example is very clever.  Boasting at dinner about his piano skills Khan is suddenly put on the spot expected to play for the entire restaurant.  Staring at the piano like he's never seen one before Khan proceeds to pound the keys will the enthusiasm and skill of a toddler.  But as Kajol steps away with a satisfied grin on her face Khan starts to play with all the skill of a concert pianist.  Queue the back up dancers and elaborate number.  It's a great sequence with both Khan and Kajol doing a great job.  It's worth seeing on Youtube if you're not sure this film is worth your time.",1462752000,,1480,4.425925925925926

1740008,5,B00006AW5T,"This is the first Bollywood/Hindi movie I saw. It bowled me over and I was hooked on Shah Rukh Khan's films from that day onward! His movies have everything I could ask for in romantic, heroic characters, comedy, drama, melodrama, musicals, action,  the list goes on and on, yet they are very different from what is generally seen in American films. That's what is so good about them. Most of them contain fun and romantic music, singing, and dancing, but when it applies there are lovely melodies, or suspenseful battle tones, etc. Mr. Khan does most of his own stunts and had had many serious injuries, but he will not let that slow him or stop him from continuing to make movies. In fact, today (2014) at nearly 50 yrs. of age he now struts a 6-pack abs chest that looks like a perfectly uniform 10 abs despite recent serious injuries. He is not a handsome guy some say, but the cameras make him seem like a every woman's dream and many a man's inspiration to be like him. His movies are simple and uncomplicated in some ways and not up to Hollywood standard until the last few years but, they are DIFFERENT in ways so unique that one can hardly get enough of them (bearing in mind that people don't all have the same tastes in movies, genres, etc.). This particular story is a humorous romance, especially the way the guy and girl (main characters) meet and their experiences on a trip to Europe which they end up going together by mistake after mistake after mistake. It's young-love romantic, real life drama and circumstances (parts of which occurred in Shah Rukh Khan's own life and relationship with his wife) rivalry, beautiful scenery, delightful music and dancing, mischievous pranks, moments you feel like crying, brutal (a bit over-the-top) fighting that keeps you wondering if anybody will survive it, and finally, a very memorable almost signature end. I hope you give it a test run. Just throw your all of your emotions in a stew pot and this movie will stir them up for you into a one-of-a-kind sensation!",1411430400,3,2023,4.650837988826815

We think the music and dancing was great, too. Really good scene with Raj and the piano-playing.
If I had been directing the movie, however, the ""fight"" scene at the end would have been edited to make sure the sound of someone being hit showed contact with the person being hit. Had a space between the face and the person hitting them once, and that put me off a bit....was a little unbelievable, but overall, still okay.

The plot thickens when the guy follows the girl back to India, in an attempt to sabotage the girls arranged marriage and ""take the bride away"". How it ends is for you to find out.

If you prefer Blu-Ray disk, then go ahead and purchase this one.

BUT, if you can buy the 2 disk DVD, then spring for that. You get all sorts of bonus features for when you fall in love with the film and want to follow up and learn more about the making of the legend. The Blu-Ray only has the film, then theres another DVD with some bonus features.

I have the single DVD, the 2 disk DVD set, and then this Blu-ray, and the quality looks the same on my 55 inch Vizio and PS3. Only the subtitles look far clearer. The movie is not fast action or explosions, so you really don't gain much from the 1080p.",1398902400,,1065,4.1352657004830915

1740043,4,B00006AW5T,"I just took a film class last semester and after seeing so many wonderful Indian films I knew I wanted to see more. As soon as I got home for break, this was the first film I watched since my professor and the articles we read discussed it so much, and for good reason. It definitely made me a fan of Khan and it made me seek out a lot of other Hindi films as well. Such a wonderfully told story and very romantic, which is one of the reasons it has become my favorite out of all of the Bollywood films I've seen (maybe even Hollywood films, too). The story, film, music, and dancing get 5 stars but the DVDs made me rate this 4 stars. The quality is not awful but not stellar either. The one thing that really annoyed me, though, was that it took me a while to realize that on the special features DVD, you actually have to click the hearts besides the titles to get to the videos, as opposed to just clicking the titles. Maybe I'm silly for not realizing that quickly (or exhausted after a tough semester - give me a break!) but that was frustrating. Additionally, although often times the actors speak in English, there are also plenty of times when they do not (as in Yash Chopra's interview) so not having subtitles for the special features DVD was ridiculous. It did arrive in the mail quickly, though, so that was nice. Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of romantic films. But considering it's the longest running film in India's history, it's attractive to many kinds of viewers. It's sweet, funny, melodramatic (which means you need to get ready to experience all sorts of emotions - it is a Bollywood film, after all), and a real joy to watch.",1388880000,,1690,4.368253968253968

1740101,3,B00006AW5T,"I want to qualify my review by saying that I'm a Caucasian American that loves Bollywood, not someone steeped in Indian culture. This is obviously a cult classic, so I hesitate to not write a glowing review. I'm a fan of SRK and Kajol in other movies they've done, but this one was just a little too over the top for me -- even though it was a foundational movie for them. For starters, there were too many obstacles to resolve in the movie. I've noticed that many Indian movies have problem after problem thrown at the main characters that they have to resolve, so maybe some people really like this, but for me, it went on too long. The chemistry and relationship between the two main characters was sweet and the storyline would have been a dream come true for a young girl with all the situations the two get thrown together in. I didn't mind it myself, and I'm in my 30s. However, the ending wasn't entirely satisfying to me. The father of the bride was quasi-demonic, and SRK's character's love for Kajol's character was plenty developed without the ""proof"" of the crazy ending. So in summary, it was a bit much for an American like me, but if you like drawn out, complicated plots with some happiness at the end, you will probably love it. It reminded me of Chup Chup Ke -- funny and light, but with one problem after the next. My favorite Bollywood movies are Jab We Met, Rab Ne Bana di Jodi, Dil Bole Hadippa, and The 3 Idiots to give you an idea of my style of movie.",1332892800,2,1477,4.355072463768116
1740112,4,B00006AW5T,"Two decades is a pretty long time for any society in the modern world. This movie is 17 years old and much has changed in Hindi Filmdom and also in India over these years. I do not want to talk about the script of this movie or about other technical things. This is a cult movie and most of you who are reading this would have watched it at least once. 17 years on, I can't help but think why this movie was such a success.
It can NOT be for Kajol's beauty (She is no Katrina Kaif) or for her histrionics. She is downright UGLY on the first count and I would rate even Amisha Patel higher than her when it comes to the latter. So what really worked to make this movie what it is?
Obviously, a successful movie is a sum total of many parts, which have to compliment each other to make a movie memorable. Music, situations, fun moments, all are present in measured doses, but all this can not make a movie have sustainable appeal. The very fact that this movie even today holds my interest, makes me think about that overriding factor which makes this movie timeless.
I am no Shah Rukh Khan fan BUT in this movie he brought to the screen what not many before him could. ENERGY. Every shot which has been picturised on him is replete with energy - uplifting, infectious energy so much so that even in the scenes in which he is NOT there, the audience can still feel that energy as if he has kept it in a stretched catapult, waiting to release it. And because we Indians are a pensive lot, we get moved by such energy. It is something that we are so devoid of in real life that we love to experience it vicariously. In fact, Shah Rukh Khan, even to this date exudes this energy, which is why I liked ""Don 2"". I have never been a Shah Rukh fan , no sir, but I need to give credit where it is due.",1329436800,,1791,4.12
1740113,4,B00006AW5T,"This is a love story between two young, second-generational British Indians who dwell in London. Raj Malhotra (Shahrukh Khan) is the spoiled, carefree son of a doting millionaire. After failing to graduate from college (and shrugging it off), Raj decides to ""console"" himself with a European trans-rail jaunt. Simran Singh (Kajol) is an obedient yet spunky girl who constantly daydreams of her future love. When Simran's strict, traditional father follows thru on an arranged marriage which had been planned for her years ago, she convinces him to let her travel thru Europe for a month, this as a last chance to see something of the world before settling down. Raj and Simran meet on the Euro-Rail, they bicker, and inevitably they fall in love. But, regretfully, all holidays must end, and, so, Simran finds herself having to return to her family and to her fast approaching wedding.

But not if Raj can help it.

This is one of those rare instances where everything that could possibly go right for a movie, did so. DILWALE DULHANIA LE JAYENGE (The Brave Heart Will Take the Bride) is one of the alltime biggest blockbusters in Indian cinema and boasts the longest, non-stop run in Indian theater, from 1995 to (last I heard) early 2007. Far as I know, it's probably still playing right now. DDLJ is considered a classic by most, and I can see why. Sure, the premise to DDLJ has been mined countless of times before and will be again. What makes DDLJ stand out from the others are the memorable performances of Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, who share a wonderful give-and-take chemistry; Shahrukh mentions in an interview that he and Kajol hardly ever rehearsed their scenes. Whatever they did, it worked. In this movie, they elevate romance to a whole new delirious level. Prim and proper and indignant collides with brash and reckless and goofy. Throw in an insoluble obstacle and tons of heartbreak and hopeless pining and secret glances exchanged. And the result is a dazzling love story. In India, should it be a surprise that Raj and Simran have gained the status of legendary lovers? No, it shouldn't.

There's a certain grace to this film. The plot unfolds with ease, the dialogue (or, as it applies to me, the sub-titles) is well-written, and the comedy bits aren't so over-the-top and obvious (although you can't totally get rid of some silliness). When the melodrama drops, it is overwrought. But the leads are so engaging that you feel for their plight, and the histrionics seem to match the occasion. The out-of-India locales might also have helped to pique interest. If I've got my Bollywood history right, DDLJ is one of the first films to showcase the central characters as residing abroad. As such, the first half of the movie is rife with many picturesque shots of the European countryside. Then the post-intermission half comes around and the scenery then moves to Punjab.

All hail Shahrukh Khan, who may not be the best of actors or even the best of dancers, but dude sure knows how to entertain. In the films I've seen him, I've never caught him trying less than his best. Although he's good here, I don't think this was his best performance; I like his stuff in Main Hoon Na a lot more. But Shahrukh, in turns goofy and wrenchingly passionate, was ultimately ingratiating enough as Raj that it made him, in this his first lead romantic role, an overnight superstar.

Just curious: In this one, whenever Shahrukh Khan performs in an energetic musical number, is anyone else reminded of Robert Morse from How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying? Or is it just me?

Meanwhile, I could go on and on about Kajol's performance, but instead I'll summarize: she is flawless, flawless, flawless.

With how often this film has been viewed, I wouldn't be at all surprised if every moment has been memorized. Me, I've got my favorites: as when Simran first realizes that she loves Raj, and when Simran meets Raj in that meadow in India. Or the scenes of Raj and Simran's father feeding the doves. Or when Raj and Simran are feeding each other. And then there are the musical segments, to which a hefty portion of the over three hours running time is devoted. As expected, they are full-blown productions, and I dug 'em. ""Ruk Jaa, O Dil Dewane"" (Stop, O My Mad Lover) sets the tone for Simran and Raj's early adversarial relationship, while the romantic ""Tujhe Dekha To Yeh Jaana Sanam"" (When I saw you, I realized...) weaves in and out of the film and is the tune most often strummed by Raj on his guitar. But my favorite has to be the lively ""Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna"" (Make Sure You're Painted With Henna?).

Oh, and yet another thing which probably contributed to the film's massive success: even though Raj and Simran are second generation British Indians, it doesn't follow that they necessarily espouse western sensibilities over conventional Hindu values. At the heart of this movie is a balancing between a modern-day outlook and a respect for Indian culture and tradition. A twist which surprised me surfaces when Kajol pleads with Raj to elope. But Raj refuses on the grounds that he is Hindustani and must do the honorable thing, which is win her father's approval. That's about as traditional as it gets.

There are no better family nights then sitting together and watching a 3-hour Bollywood film, and like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, most of them star our favorite Hindi actor Shah Rukh Khan!

Like Veer and Zaara, but an earlier film, this movie is about the accidental meeting of a young Indian couple that was not meant to be as she had already been promised by her father to the son of friend.  Because there is no sexual contact in Hindi films, these movies are always safe bets for younger children, and our tween daughter is obsessed with Hindi films now.

In this movie, Shah Rukh Khan has little time to win the approval of his new lovers hard-nosed and controlling father, never mind getting him to retract the arrangement he has made for his daughter to marry his friends son.  But Shah Rukh Khan goes to extreme lengths to win over her family, because he wants to marry her with her fathers approval, instead of just eloping.

There's great music, beautiful costumes and fantastic scenery, all typical of Hindi movies.  There's tension and romance and in this film, there's even comedy.  Dilwale Dulhanie Le Jayenge wins a place of honor in our Hindi movie collection!",1318723200,4,1312,4.6695652173913045

1740121,1,B00006AW5T,"Worst BLU-RAY ever made for one of the best movie classic.
If you are buying the blu-ray for image quality, you will be most likely disappointed.

You can see the poor and inconsistent image quality starting with the opening credit with movie title and throughout the movie. I believe this has to do with the master source used for the blu-ray and poor processing. The blu-ray version is several steps backwards in terms of the image quality and the title & index organization. Throughout the movie, the image sharpness go in and out of focus, many many grainy spots, poor contrast/exposure, and the color saturation fluctuates, resulting into poor quality image. Honestly I have seen much sharper DVD quality of old 60's and 70's movies made by Shemaroo, even when they are played on 120 inch screen without up-converting them(not trying to promote them, but just to give you a fair comparison).
I cannot understand how one can go several steps backward with the new technology and not realize it?
I feel this to be a complete insult to the blu-ray technology and a Bollywood classic with great location, superb cinematography, songs, and story.

I will keep my hope alive for the Yashraaj films to re-release this movie with improved master source and processing, as I know they are capable (e.g. Dhoom blu-ray version to be a good example). In general, buying Bollywood blu-ray, we are taking chances, as there is no guarantee of the image quality, they are little overpriced (especially in US and UK), and in most cases they would put the same source with little or no processing to improve the picture quality/resolution to take advantage of the blu-ray technology.",1303516800,2,1670,4.897526501766785
1740132,5,B00006AW5T,"I have to say that watching this movie was an amazing introduction into Bollywood! It easily made its way into my Top 10 favorite movies of all time, and as an indie filmmaker, my list of favorites is huge!

I hope that tells you something about the quality of the film - the performances, cinematography, script/storyline, editing, and score are almost flawless.  This is one of those movies that made me laugh and cry more than once during the first and subsequent viewings.  There's a reason why it has run for 800 consecutive weeks in India!

If you're looking at buying this movie, I'll assume you know how awesome it is and/or have read other reviews, so I'll just add a comment on the DVD itself.

I bought the one that said it had English subtitles, not knowing whether or not the original had any.  I did not know at the time DDLJ is on Blu-Ray, or I would have just ordered that instead.

The video quality was acceptable, although I would have liked to see such a famous film remastered.  The DVD menu is animated and cute.  There is an option just to play the songs, which is nice, as sometimes that's enough to relive the experience without watching all three hours of it again.

The one problem I would note is that the subtitles disappear during the scene where she breaks her fast for the Karwa Chauth (right when they are putting the candles in the water).  The titles do return a few minutes later, but I do wish that wasn't a problem.

The movie's great, though, so I have to give it five stars anyway.  My love for it trumps any technical glitches.

But bottom line - if you like the movie enough to consider a purchase, just go ahead get it on Blu-Ray.  That's what I'm going to do now. :)

[EDIT]

We did wind up buying the BluRay version, and I can't tell you how blown away I was by the difference in quality. You still have the occasional interlacing that you may notice at times, but the clarity of and the details you can see in the video are amazing, and the color pops with intensity! It's really, really a much better quality product than the regular DVD, and completely worth it if you love the movie.

My one complaint, I guess, is the quality of the bonus DVD that came with it. The special features are not BluRay - they are only standard definition DVD. And there are no subtitle options. True, they speak in English about half of the time, but I'd really like to know what they're saying for the rest of it, too. So if you get this one, buy it for the quality of the movie and not the bonus features.

Otherwise, I thought it was great, and I feel good about this purchase, even after having the other version already. It actually made me appreciate the BluRay more...",1303344000,13,2704,4.372

1740137,5,B00006AW5T,"'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,' or DDLJ as it's known, is the longest-running Indian film in history--it released in 1995 and it's been continuously playing ever since (one theater in Mumbai still has daily showings). The title has an old-fashioned ring to it--it means ""The Brave-Hearted Will Take the Bride""--but it's about reconciling the past with the future. It captures a moment in time--the mid-1990s--when India liberalized its economy and opened its doors to the world, and with it came tremendous social and cultural change as Indian tradition clashed with Western modernity. Suddenly, Indians weren't just Indians, but world citizens like never before. The reason the film's appeal is so enduring is because India is still negotiating those changes and the film's main character, Raj, resolves those issues of identity within himself.

Actor Shahrukh Khan's portrayal of Raj catapulted him to superstardom--where he remains to this day--arguably the most famous actor in the world. When the film released, Khan had been in the business for three years and already had more than a dozen decent films to his name, but he was known primarily for his villainous roles. DDLJ not only made him a star, it also turned him into the quintessential romantic hero. His character became an archetype for future Bollywood heroes--brash, hip, and Westernized, but also upstanding and distinctly Indian. Gone was Hindi cinema's street-tough, angry young man of old--the new hero was cosmopolitan, privileged, and proud of his roots.

Khan was paired with actress Kajol--for the second time (the first was in their 1993 hit 'Baazigar'), but this outing made them a legendary onscreen couple, and they went on to co-star in the hits 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' (1998), 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' (2001), and 'My Name Is Khan' (2010).

DDLJ was a film of firsts. Aditya Chopra, the son of filmmaker Yash Chopra, made his directorial debut with DDLJ--at the age of 23. The movie also firmly established a new and important audience for Hindi cinema: non-resident Indians, NRIs as they're called, Indians who live outside of India. Today, many films are specifically made and marketed with this audience in mind.

The main characters, Raj and Simran (Kajol), are NRIs living in London. Raj wears a leather jacket, drinks beer, drives sports cars and motorcycles. He's a terrible student, a good athlete (at Western sports), a bad boy with a good heart. His rich dad loves him to pieces and spoils him rotten. Simran is more traditional, a sweet and sensible girl from a middle-class family. For the most part, she obeys her strict parents, who plan to ship her off to the Punjab to marry the son of a family friend, even though she dreams of romance.

Raj and Simran meet while vacationing with their friends in Switzerland--a literal and symbolic escape from the strictures of family, where they break loose and indulge in some fantasies. Theirs is not a new story--boy falls in love with girl who is about to be unwillingly married to another. But Raj refuses to do anything as deceptive as elope--the love of a virtuous Indian woman makes an honorable man out of him. The action moves to India in the second half, where Raj sets out to win the approval of Simran's family--and her stern father couldn't be a tougher nut to crack. The couple believes that old and new ways can co-exist--by choosing each other and then earning their parents' blessing. Raj and Simran become different people, better people, because of it.

1740141,2,B00006AW5T,"I own about a hundred Bollywood movies on DVD, and I'm not even Indian.

To be honest, I thought that this movie is not only the worst Yash Raj film I ever saw, but to me, it's the worst Bollywood film that I've ever seen, and only for one main reason.  Shahrukh Khan (who I usually do appreciate) was very annoying in this film.  (Worst than Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace)  And although I do love Kajol, however, she couldn't save this film because of Shahrukh Khan's embarrassing behavior of his character.

But, I generally watch a Bollywood film because I love to watch good looking people on film. A good story is only secondary as my intention to be entertained.

If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:

First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.

The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.

Bollywood films are very colorful. All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the scenaries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.

About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent). I personally wish there were less music videos if the movie is already over three hours long.

About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.

One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)

So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Though I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is ""Lagaan"" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago. And perhaps ""Mann"" with Aamir Khan, and ""Rangeela"" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar. Oh, and I guess it would be truly appreciated if ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" starring Amisha Patel and Hrithik Roshan would ever be released in High Definition Blu-Ray. The scenes in India and New Zealand were all just so beautiful on the screen.",1269993600,,2532,4.562913907284768

1740153,3,B00006AW5T,"This film has some of Kajol's most adorable scenes, dancing in the rain, in a towel, and in the snow. But it also has a rather long distasteful scene of her drunk and out of control.  But my biggest problem with the movie was with the inconsistencies in Shahrukh Khan's character. In the first half of the movie, he's a disrespectful, spoiled, insincere, rich kid who disrespects his elders, leeches off his rich daddy, steals beer, cons girls, and bullies nerds.  Then in the second half of the movie we're suddenly supposed to respect and adore him, and to believe that shy, conservative, sweetheart Kajol could fall in love with this rogue who has bullied, tricked, and humiliated her.  Suddenly he is portrayed as the picture of kindness and respect for tradition as he tries to win over her family. If you watched only the second half of this movie, you might like it. But it's impossible to believe that the jerk from the first half is the dutiful family-man of the second half.
  Also it has one of the most atrociously choreographed and filmed fight scenes I've ever seen.  You can see a gap a foot wide between the fists and the people their supposed to be hitting. I've seen stage shows in primary schools that did more realistic looking fights!
  I can't completely hate the movie because Kajol makes almost anything worth watching and has some of her most adorable sequences in this film, and the film does have it's share of charming moments.

1740173,4,B00006AW5T,"This is a love story between two young, second-generational British Indians who dwell in London. Raj Malhotra (Shahrukh Khan) is the spoiled, carefree son of a doting millionaire. After failing to graduate from college (and shrugging it off), Raj decides to ""console"" himself with a European trans-rail jaunt. Simran Singh (Kajol) is an obedient yet spunky girl who constantly daydreams of her future love. When Simran's strict, traditional father follows thru on an arranged marriage which had been planned for her years ago, she convinces him to let her travel thru Europe for a month, this as a last chance to see something of the world before settling down. Raj and Simran meet on the Euro-Rail, they bicker, and inevitably they fall in love. But, regretfully, all holidays must end, and, so, Simran finds herself having to return to her family and to her fast approaching wedding.

But not if Raj can help it.

This is one of those rare instances where everything that could possibly go right for a movie, did so. DILWALE DULHANIA LE JAYENGE (The Brave Heart Will Take the Bride) is one of the alltime biggest blockbusters in Indian cinema and boasts the longest, non-stop run in Indian theater, from 1995 to (last I heard) early 2007. Far as I know, it's probably still playing right now. DDLJ is considered a classic by most, and I can see why. Sure, the premise to DDLJ has been mined countless of times before and will be again. What makes DDLJ stand out from the others are the memorable performances of Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, who share a wonderful give-and-take chemistry; Shahrukh mentions in an interview that he and Kajol hardly ever rehearsed their scenes. Whatever they did, it worked. In this movie, they elevate romance to a whole new delirious level. Prim and proper and indignant collides with brash and reckless and goofy. Throw in an insoluble obstacle and tons of heartbreak and hopeless pining and secret glances exchanged. And the result is a dazzling love story. In India, should it be a surprise that Raj and Simran have gained the status of legendary lovers? No, it shouldn't.

There's a certain grace to this film. The plot unfolds with ease, the dialogue (or, as it applies to me, the sub-titles) is well-written, and the comedy bits aren't so over-the-top and obvious (although you can't totally get rid of some silliness). When the melodrama drops, it is overwrought. But the leads are so engaging that you feel for their plight, and the histrionics seem to match the occasion. The out-of-India locales might also have helped to pique interest. If I've got my Bollywood history right, DDLJ is one of the first films to showcase the central characters as residing abroad. As such, the first half of the movie is rife with many picturesque shots of the European countryside. Then the post-intermission half comes around and the scenery then moves to Punjab.

All hail Shahrukh Khan, who may not be the best of actors or even the best of dancers, but dude sure knows how to entertain. In the films I've seen him, I've never caught him trying less than his best. Although he's good here, I don't think this was his best performance; I like his stuff in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Main-Hoon-Na/dp/B000LXSAIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Main Hoon Na</a>&nbsp;a lot more. But Shahrukh, in turns goofy and wrenchingly passionate, was ultimately ingratiating enough as Raj that it made him, in this his first lead romantic role, an overnight superstar.

Just curious: In this one, whenever Shahrukh Khan performs in an energetic musical number, is anyone else reminded of Robert Morse from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Succeed-in-Business-Without-Really-Trying/dp/079284484X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</a>? Or is it just me?

Meanwhile, I could go on and on about Kajol's performance, but instead I'll summarize: she is flawless, flawless, flawless.

With how often this film has been viewed, I wouldn't be at all surprised if every moment has been memorized. Me, I've got my favorites: as when Simran first realizes that she loves Raj, and when Simran meets Raj in that meadow in India. Or the scenes of Raj and Simran's father feeding the doves. Or when Raj and Simran are feeding each other. And then there are the musical segments, to which a hefty portion of the over three hours running time is devoted. As expected, they are full-blown productions, and I dug 'em. ""Ruk Jaa, O Dil Dewane"" (Stop, O My Mad Lover) sets the tone for Simran and Raj's early adversarial relationship, while the romantic ""Tujhe Dekha To Yeh Jaana Sanam"" (When I saw you, I realized...) weaves in and out of the film and is the tune most often strummed by Raj on his guitar. But my favorite has to be the lively ""Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna"" (Make Sure You're Painted With Henna?).

To commemorate the (then) 500 weeks of straight theater run of DDLJ, this two disc dvd set was released. The first disc contains the feature film. The second disc has the heavy-hitting bonus stuff. It kicks off with the 23-minute-long ""Making Of"" featurette, the highlights of which are whenever the vibrant Kajol was on-camera. There's the ""Success Story"" segment, which traces the path of DDLJ and also includes an NDTV interview with Kajol and Shahrukh; the Filmfare Awards '95 Highlights (where DDLJ won all the major awards, including Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Picture); 7 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary (in English); Uday Chopra converses with Shahrukh Khan (in English), Kajol (in English) & Producer Yash Chopra; the theatrical trailer; and television promos.

Oh, and yet another thing which probably contributed to the film's massive success: even though Raj and Simran are second generation British Indians, it doesn't follow that they necessarily espouse western sensibilities over conventional Hindu values. At the heart of this movie is a balancing between a modern-day outlook and a respect for Indian culture and tradition. A twist which surprised me surfaces when Kajol pleads with Raj to elope. But Raj refuses on the grounds that he is Hindustani and must do the honorable thing, which is win her father's approval. That's about as traditional as it gets.

That one also garnered a boatload of major Filmfare awards. More importantly, it's also a very good movie.",1206748800,7,6822,5.244729605866178
1740174,4,B00006AW5T,"That Indian romance could be so good? Winner of 11 film awards and a classic of Bollywood, I had never heard of this film(translated, The Brave Heart will Take the Bride) and stumbled across it by accident on Netflix, getting it on a whim. What a joyous discovery. While prevented from overlong song sequences and a more than a small dose of sheer goofiness from being another Romeo and Juliet or Pride and Prejudice, this is an intensely romantic, delightful, and well-made concoction, starring in what was to become their most famous role a couple who are apparently famous in Bollywood film, Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, known informally as Srk-Kajol. The two have almost painfully intense chemistry at times, and this, along with Shahrukh's character, the bafflingly annoying and yet intensely charismatic Raj, lights up the film. The first half is taken up by their initial meeting, which leads Simran, Kajol's character, to instantly hate him, and by a series of circumstances that throws them together. What I particularly liked about this film is it's so wildly unpredictable, not merely for the colorful Indian melodrama and singing/dancing scenes the characters were likely to spring into at any moment but also because rather than taking the traditional route of romantic comedies the producers instead trace a delicately nuanced, hilarious, and often painfully realistic path for the passion that springs up between the two, and for the fact that it is not during those initial scenes of being thrown together(so requisite for any romance) that they really fall in love but later on, when they part. An odd mix of wit, comedy, melodrama, and genuine feeling in the first half, I was already in love with it, but the turn to utterly convincing passion in the second, as the lovers struggle with her family and tradition, completely took my breath away. I give only one example - Raj finally comes to find Simran at her family's home, and finds her in a field of golden wheat outside her family's home, where she has been drawn by the haunting music of his banjo, which she thinks is yet another dream. The moment when she sees him and runs to him is one of the single most classic scenes I have ever seen onscreen. And not only women will enjoy this romance - Raj, as a womanizing, shameless, overconfident, ever-witty and tricky(even, and most especially, to Simran) wealthy Indian expatriate, is someone that every man can identify with and in fact envy(as I learned to my cost while watching it). The two main flaws this movie does possess - which keep it from being a true romantic classic - is, as I said before, over-the-top music sequences and its healthy splurge of goofiness. But with the longest-running initial release in Indian history, this movie had to have something good. And indeed it does. It glows.",1185235200,8,2824,4.873180873180873

`Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (translation: ""The brave heart will take the bride"") was released in `95 and is unquestionably one of the most beloved Indian films ever to come out of Bollywood. This Yash Raj comedy, romance, drama stars the incomparable Shah Rukh Khan and the beautiful Kajol as two young British Hindustani's, Raj and Simran, who meet during a one month European vacation. Things do not start out well for the two, but slowly the ongoing banter of dislike and ridicule between them transforms into friendship and finally so much more. Unfortunately Simran is leaving for India soon after their return to England where she will fulfill her Father's wishes and be wed to a stranger in a pre-arranged marriage. Will Raj follow her to the Motherland in hopes of stopping the wedding and claiming Simran for himself? If he does who will win out in the end, Love or Tradition?

I guess 1.1 billion Indians can't be wrong. Shah Rukh and Kajol are perfectly matched as foils and lovers, they are absolutely marvelous together. Watch and see two of the biggest stars in the world in top form, you'll love it too!",1179446400,52,1157,4.809045226130653

It won 10 Filmfare Awards (the Indian equivalent of the Oscars), and played an unprecendented 500 weeks in movie theaters (I saw a website recently that said as of Dec. 2006 it was still playing!). It came to Indian theaters in 1995 and didn't leave! Anyway, this movie has it all: great acting, superb writing, wonderful characters, comedy, drama, romance, singing, dancing, action. And this was director Aditya Chopra's first film! What a debut! Come, fall in love!",1174262400,7,547,4.768421052631579

Sometimes the style may be a bit hard for Americans to take....because they are often not ""realistic"".  But I LOVE the way they highlight love and family.  So many of the joys of life and the virtues that make life worth living...these are in these movies!  Bollywood people really know how to make movies.  Hollywood movies could only dream of coming EVEN close!

The actors are handsome and absolutely entrancing...and the actresses are the most beautiful in the world!  The costumes are gorgeous...makes one wish we could dress that way!

The whole family will LOVE this movie...clean and fun!  Worth the work of reading the subtitles!  But...be careful..these movies are addictive!

This movie has two of the most amazing of their stars...when they were just starting out...they get even better as they mature!  Dil is heart...Braveheart Carries Away the Bride.

Being something of a romantic, I fell into the story of Simran dreaming of an unseen love and unknowingly turning Raj from his lack of seriousness to loving her with all the devotion one wouldn't of thought he had.

Raj is a carefree young man that enjoys a good time and seems to excel at everything. He's also good at manipulating others as we first see him manipulate his father and then others.

The first half of the movie is a slapstick comedy while he and Simran travel Europe and fall for each other. In the second half, there is more drama but with comic moments. Raj follows Simran & her family to Punjab and tries surreptitiously to win over her family in the 16 days before the wedding while imposing on the groom's family's hospitality. His plan is working until the wedding is moved forward a few days, and it isn't pretty when his plans are found out.

I adore this movie and have played it over and over. Unfortunately, you can't purchase the ringtone in the U.S.",1128470400,11,1006,4.4863387978142075
