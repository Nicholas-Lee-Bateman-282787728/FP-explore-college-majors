She marries the boyfriend of the Chinese dishwasher, and become the lover of the Maori cook.  Her father violently objects.",1255219200,,445,4.6075949367088604
8173867,4,B000N19MR8,"""Broken English"" tells the story of Nina (played by Aleksandra Vujcic) who is actually a CROATIAN refugee (the back of the box states Bosnian). Fleeing the war-torn Balkans the family migrates to New Zealand as Nina's mother was born in this country. Working at a local restaurant Nina meets Eddy, a chef who also happens to be Maori. What ensues is a passionate love affair that dramatically tears Nina's family apart.

The themes that dominate the film are of family loyalties in the the face of trauma and displacement. Moving forward because one is torn from there roots and past is what really fuels the possessiveness of Nina's father (played by Rade Serbedzua). He constantly replays home movies of the war-torn Croatia which upsets him profoundly. During one emotional scene where the family feels drained by the emotions watching re-runs of the war brings out of them the father screams about New Zealand ""This is not my country!"" He fears for his families life to the point where he tries to control each member minute by minute. He has already ""lost his country"" now he wants to keep his family intact by any means necessary (by any means necessary including emotional & physical abuse). Nina's boyfriend Eddy also feels displaced as he comes from traditional Maori roots but now lives in the city. He has spent substantial time away from his home and harbours guilt he was not there when his father died. Than there is the added dimension of Chinese migrants who have willingly come to New Zealand to create a new life and become ""kiwis"" showing how people relate to the culture from 3 different perspectives.

The layers of pain within the Croatian family is profound and one I know too well (being a woman of Croatian descent raised in Australia). This film conveys well that roots run deep but a brighter future is what one should live for instead of dwelling in the darkness of the past and the emotions and insular alliances such emotions birth. It also shows authentically the many racial & class divisions that run rampant in New Zealand (as well as Australian) communities. How the melting pot is far from peaceful and how people are conflicted about having to adapt to the many differences around them. I like the film and recommend it to all who have a genuine interest in seeing what life is like for non- Anglo Saxon people in the Southern Hemisphere.",1208217600,3,2375,4.762135922330097
