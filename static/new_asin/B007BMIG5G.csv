5073655,3,B007BMIG5G,"I really enjoyed this series.  The fan service coupled with the comedy throughout made for a great anime.  However, I was really disappointed with the way the series ended.  It sort of fizzled out at the end, and did not come to a satisfactory conclusion.  I have since learned that the manga version continues past where the anime ended, but there do not seem to be any plans in the works to do a 3rd season of the anime.",1281312000,,422,4.30379746835443
5073656,5,B007BMIG5G,"I really loved this series. It was funny, had great action, a good story, and to top it off it was many times martially accurate.

Now I can enjoy one of (in my opinion ) the best martial arts anime I've seen. Kenichi is a relatable but quirky main character and there is certainly fan service.

5073722,5,B007BMIG5G,"I have the entire 9 season dragonball z series and whenever I watch one the kenichi animae preview advertisement is shown, so I decided to order season 1 and 2 and i'm so glad I did because it is funny as hell but at the same time it shows the rigors of martial arts training in different styles and using what you learned during the fights and learning new moves that seemed hard at first for Kenichi at first etc.....

If anyone hasn't ordered this series its a must have to watch as part of your animae collection, but the thing is if you have the time is to watch each episode back to back because it keeps you watching.",1407628800,,624,4.2

5073738,5,B007BMIG5G,I love the series (sad it's not playing anymore!!) But it has the flare and much more. Kenichi is still a wimp but he's starting to gain some confidance in himself is this part of the anime,1399420800,,189,4.135135135135135

5073740,5,B007BMIG5G,This anime has actual real techniques and exercise physiology truth to it. That amazed me on top if the fact that its funny has a lot of action and great characters. You will get sucked in and be so disappointed when its over! By the way the whole series is free on netflix.

5073741,4,B007BMIG5G,"This is a two thin packed DVD by Funimation and it was nearly flawless. The DVD came sealed and undamaged. All the discs worked perfectly. It also has dual audio so you can watch either English or Japanese audio. It was worth it for $33 since it is a rare DVD now. The only thing that this DVD lacked was special features which most Funimation DVDs lack. Overall, if you want to continue on Kenichi's journey to become the strongest disciple I highly recommend adding this to your collection.",1395014400,,492,4.53932584269663

5073745,5,B007BMIG5G,"Things just keep getting tougher for old Kenichi, but with his Masters he can do anything! (or die trying!) So join our hero as he fights for justice and maybe the girl.
Great story and characters. Great action. LEGIT SOUNDTRACK!",1381017600,,229,4.75
5073746,5,B007BMIG5G,"I wouldn't normally be saying that about a fighting anime. Usually the story and characters of that genre just don't appeal to me. That couldn't be further from the truth in this case. This show is so well done I just couldn't help but to fall for it. In fact every now and then I invite my anime loving friends over and we marathon the series from beginning to end over a few days. It just never get's old.

Kenichi The Mightiest Disciple is about a boy known by many as ""Weak Knee's Kenichi"" Who has spent most of his life being pushed around. What others didn't notice about him was while he was taking those beatings he never gave in. What he lacked wasn't heart, it was strength, endurance, and most of all training. From the beginning his masters explained to him in no uncertain terms he has absolutely no natural talent, mental or physical. He would have to struggle against nature itself to be remade. That in a nutshell is what this show is all about. Be warned the show is extremely silly at times but that's the world of Kenichi. I recommend this anime to anyone who likes fighting anime's but also to those who (like me) are kind of turned off by them. This show is different enough from your standard beat'em up that its worth a look. I think you'll be glad you did. I can tell you without one bit of buyers remorse that I own the whole series.",1376524800,2,1358,4.325490196078431

5073781,5,B007BMIG5G,There really needs to be a third season to this product. Kenichi progressed beyond any disciple he truly is histories strongest disciple. This is one of the purest martial arts anime ever,1372809600,3,187,4.875
5073782,5,B007BMIG5G,"If you've seen the first season of this show, this is a ""Must Have"".  I mean, who could possibly have watched season one without wanting to watch season two... that's just wrong. ;)",1370736000,2,181,4.484848484848484

5073784,5,B007BMIG5G,although some of the combat is extreme the series does teach basic martial. Important is to look past the poor comedy stick and stay with the story,1366675200,,147,4.481481481481482
5073785,5,B007BMIG5G,My daughters loves this anime. They first saw it on netflix and watched in several times a day. Netflix took the cartoon off so we bought the Dvds.,1364428800,2,147,4.285714285714286

And the martial arts moves perfomed here are realistic. The only thing that's sad is no 3rd season. But its cool to watch.",1361923200,,300,4.189655172413793
5073792,5,B007BMIG5G,best ever i watch it all the time . i looked all over for it and could not find it up untill i came to amozon and such it...and there it was. this literally have brought back part of me,1360972800,,185,3.65
5073793,5,B007BMIG5G,I loved this dvd.  This is a great anime made by Funimation.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes DBZ because it has some of the same voice actors in it.  It was funny too.,1360540800,,177,3.861111111111111
5073794,5,B007BMIG5G,"This is not just your typical high-school kids karate-fighting video. The animation looks ""cartoony"" but there is a well-written story with evolving characters, and philosophical development.",1358208000,,191,6.384615384615385

5073807,5,B007BMIG5G,"Man when I first started reading the books, I didn't really give much thought, but man the books were really good! As so is the show, just as good as the book! People in the show just as colorfull and enjoyable to watch!",1351382400,,220,4.1395348837209305
5073808,5,B007BMIG5G,"Kenichi is a high school student. He's kind of a wimp and he's always getting picked on. He meets Miu. Miu's hot, understanding of his troubles, and willing to help. Her grandfather runs a dojo where 6 masters live. Kenichi is invited to live with Miu at her dojo and receive hellish martial arts training. He's not a natural but he's determined to beat up the bad guys and win Miu's heart. There are lots of wacky martial arts comedy moments and awesome fight scenes. This anime is loaded. Great story, tons of interesting characters, good animation, and lots of comedy. Everything about this anime is great! The more you watch the more addicted you get. I love ""Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple"", I hope you do too.",1349568000,7,716,4.645669291338582
5073809,5,B007BMIG5G,"Kenichi: the mightiest disciple is a great show that has a great message for anyone. The second season is just as good as the first. The show if fun to watch with its perfect combination of humor, action and slight fan service. This is a show that is worth watching.",1344384000,,266,4.34
5073810,5,B007BMIG5G,"The plot for Kenichi: the Mightiest Disciple is simple and straight forward: timid high school boy, Kenichi, decides to become a martial arts master to impress a girl.  From there the story goes forward as Kenichi moves into the Ryosanpoku dojo and undergoes grueling training under 6 different martial arts masters.  In time, Kenichi becomes a most proficient fighter, which is a good thing since he has run afoul of Ragnarok, a vicious gang of street fighters with eight masters of their own.

There are many things to like about this series: great animation; very interesting and well developed characters, especially among the supporting cast; great humor; female characters with big breasts; and a story that really moves along.  One of the best parts of Kenichi is the fight scenes, which are fast moving and well staged.  The voice actors, especially on the English dubbed versions are well matched to their characters, and veteran Anime watchers will instantly recognize Christopher Sabat from his work on One Piece and Dragon Ball Z.

Kenichi: the Mightiest Disciple could best be described as a small scale epic, it doesn't have a convoluted mythology as a back story and is set in the ""real"" world; there is no one with God like powers squaring off with an equally omnipotent foe.  For Kenichi, it all comes down to hard work and hours and hours of intense training while picking up the wisdom of his sometimes less than sympathetic masters.  And what young Kenichi lacks in natural talent, he makes up for with heart and determination.  Along the way, Kenichi learns that sometimes the true art is the art of making friends, and by the end of the second season, when the final show down with Ragnarok comes, Kenichi has proven himself so well, that such former foes as Takeda, Siegfried, Hermit, and Thor are willing to stand with him and proudly proclaim their friendship.

I did think that early in the series they overdid Kenichi's timidness and the way his character whined and cried in every episode could grow irritating, but by the second season it was thankfully toned down; and there is a plot twist concerning Kenichi, Miu, and the main villain Ryuto, that seems contrived and shoe horned into the series to give their final battle more meaning.  But at a mere fifty episodes, this series seems way too short and leaves the viewer wanting more.  There has been at least one OVA and talk of picking up the series for a season 3.

All in all, Kenichi: the Mightiest Disciple has a story that's easy to follow, great characters and good animation; the kind of Anime that people who normally don't want to watch this kind of thing might enjoy.

Did I mention it has female characters with big breasts?",1342483200,,2719,4.782051282051282
5073811,5,B007BMIG5G,"I seriously must say that this series is one of the best! i will keep out the details and leave it up to the others to talk about but this is a show i would have loved to watch when i was a kid right next to dragonball z, tenchi, and kenshin. And this show is very funny, the right amount of ""fan service"" (if your into that), and it has martial arts! and i cant watch this at night because it gets me pumped up!
Where could you go wrong?!? im buying this because i loved the series and in hope the sales could increase the chance of a season 3 instead of just OVAs they are making right now.

oh and you could end up learning some new moves by watching it :)",1339718400,11,659,3.8814814814814813
5073812,5,B007BMIG5G,"I'm an avid otaku and I have to say that Kenichi is by far one of my favorites. The characters all have personalities, albeit strange ones, that one can relate to. Other than the OVA's that are being produced I wish they'd make a third or fourth season of it too.",1334275200,5,263,4.176470588235294
5073813,4,B007BMIG5G,I was a good solid story line and great action! There arn't any super hero powers like in most but there are some good ancient secret marshal arts.,1326672000,,147,4.285714285714286
5073814,5,B007BMIG5G,"My first instinct would not to go for this kind of anime, however! this is pretty awesome. I originally watched it on the net and I loved it, It has action, comedy a little bit of romance in one sense of the word. I loved the Japanese voice actors and actresses in this, they really choose good people for the characters, which is one of the reasons I loved this. I haven't watched it in english yet but definitely will give it a try. It's a good story about an outcast kid trying to fit in, he went from having no friends and being weak, thus he got bullied as ""weak legs"" to slowing gaining friends, strength and courage. It's a story of how hard work, dedication and perseverance eventually pays off. It has a total of 50 episodes of which I watched twice back to back, it was that good. However the story does not end with these episodes, there is also a continuing Manga and I heard or read somewhere that a season three has been approved in Japan, so I'm hoping to see more of Kenichi's progress both in martial arts and with Miu. If you like Naruto and or Fighting Spirit then I'm sure you will like this also.",1325808000,3,1117,4.248826291079812
5073815,3,B007BMIG5G,"I was disappointed with Kenichi's wining and fleeing type of character, but what made up for it was when he used the new technique he learned, whenever he had to protect someone.  I was into the more serious mode of him.  My rating was based on the unanswered Questions about Miou's parents, if Kenichi every got strong enough to even come close to Miou's superior fighting skills.  Because his training was focused with the masters, I felt he should of become a better fighter.  If this really isn't the end I'd change my rating to a 4.  This series is built like a long series anime usually is.  I hope they don't stop there.  There's also the Chinese master's daughter that had an unfinished plot too.  The fights are good though!  That's where I throw my highest rating.",1309910400,,774,4.550724637681159
5073816,5,B007BMIG5G,"I've already written a near-glowing review for Kenichi Season One, and I'm writing one about the second season because it contains a gem of an episode that truly crystallizes what is so appealing about this series and the Kenichi character himself: he's a put-upon loser AND a put-upon winner. No matter how much he progresses, he never really changes; he's basically a mouse who (very occasionally) roars. In the second series' fifth episode, Kenichi is taken to a mountain valley by a martial artist called The Elder, who is a cross between Gandalf and God. There he is put through the wringer - he is forced to find his own food, he is left to fend for himself against wild animals, and he is soon abandoned by his master. When a hermit finds him collapsed on the ground, he is taken in, fed and comforted. But the hermit is a martial artist as well, one who uses the art as a blood sport, and Kenichi must make a choice between following his original master (whom he's none too pleased with at the moment) and following the darker path of this new, seemingly-much-kinder master.

Kenichi's reactions and expressions during his ordeal are classic. Whether he's running from a bear or throwing a tantrum at his master, his whines and protests are hilarious and touching. He is one of the most lovable and human of all anime heroes, and it is those qualities that really makes this series stand out. You really wind up caring about the little schmuck despite of (or maybe because of) his flaws. When the chips are down and the cause is just, the lion lurking in Kenichi's soul rouses and he can be a real badass in a fight. But it is his other side, the timid and flawed human side, that really makes Kenichi a winner. Don't miss this anime - ESPECIALLY don't miss season 2!",1306540800,,1775,4.546875
5073827,5,B007BMIG5G,A good end to the series.  I just wish it was not over because the manga keeps going.  A good mix of action and humor.,1304553600,,118,3.68
5073828,4,B007BMIG5G,"Ya know something. This is a great series for any anime watcher to consider. I personally liked it because the main character Kenichi undergoes a series of training techniques to become a more skilled and courageous individual. There are a bunch of funny points in the series too which always keeps a smile going. Overall, I'd give Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple a 9 out of 10",1304035200,,376,4.712121212121212
5073829,5,B007BMIG5G,"This is the continuation of the previous box set. Kenichi, a man with not talent for the martial arts, joins the ryosanpaku and trains everyday under 6 different masters. While learning these arts in the hope of one day protecting Miu, the elder's granddaughter, Kenichi is constantly attacked by a street gang of Martial artist calling themselves Ragnarok. Kenichi and his friends must fight back as Ragnarok sends it's most powerful members, the eight deadly fist, to try and stop them. If the training doesn't kill him, Kenichi might just become history's Mightiest/Strongest (it translates both ways) Disciple.
I personally love this Anime. It is funny, action packed, and has a great story line. Not for all people though. A lot of big boob related jokes so keep out of reach of small children. Other than that everything is amazing. You should buy it.",1303948800,2,857,4.958333333333333
5073830,5,B007BMIG5G,"Not that Season One & Season Two, Part 1 were bad (they weren't)the whole Kenichi series is GREAT.  It's funny, it's serious, and informative - who could ask for more?  I'm looking forward to purchasing the remainder of the series asap.",1302652800,,236,4.7317073170731705
5073831,5,B007BMIG5G,This wonderful series is a spiritual successor to the classic Ranma 1/2. Wonderful Martial arts comedy. Hilarious cast of characters. It's that good.,1298764800,,149,5.521739130434782
5073832,4,B007BMIG5G,"In Season Two (as you would expect) Kenichi fights even tougher opponents. The last of course being the toughest. This is the best martial arts anime I've ever seen. The second best would probably be Tenjho Tenge. The story line is good and goes back into Kenichi and Miu's childhood. The last 3 episodes have awesome fight scenes although unrealistic are great all the same.

The video quality is good but I wish their was a blu-ray version so you could have less discs. On a side note I wish anime companies would care about the anime they put out and take more time with them. By this I mean that they should have both the Japanese and English audio in TrueHD 5.1, not stereo. I wish they would either CGI their anime like FF7 except with more color or use something like HD Master (the new Hellsing did this).

If you're wondering if there is more comedy moments you won't be disappointed. That keeps going.
This anime loses 1 star because the anime quality could be much better (like I mentioned before) and there is some swearing but apart from that it's great.",1296604800,6,1067,4.494845360824742
5073833,5,B007BMIG5G,"This series is Phenomenal, as a Martial artist  I love the message it carries..How Kenichi embodies the spirt of a Martial artist.... This series is great for any one who is training in Martial arts or for anyone looking for some quality action with an hilarious base...This is definitely at the top of the list of its category Both seasons are awesome!",1296432000,,353,4.693548387096774
5073834,4,B007BMIG5G,Great disc the makes up for how slow paced  season two part 1 went but it felt at times this disc was a lil too fast paced esp. on how some of the fist were getting beat up but still very entertaining wanted to see a lil more form to the fighters kind of how season one wanted to portray the martial arts mostly all out brawler at times not bad i guess still very entertaining worth 30 dollars yea probably you kinda get ur money's worth in entertainment i guess it to manga reading if you wanna get deeper into the story would've prob gave the masters a lil more background story but the 50 episodes what can you do :) :),1290988800,,622,4.056910569105691

5073836,4,B007BMIG5G,"By now you've probably watched season one at least, so I'm not going into a story line. The romantic side of this story gets a little sappy as part of the overall pulling of all of the story lines together. Part of the entwined past coming together ending was foreshadowed in S2 Pt1 with Odin, the First Fist. While it does pull together, it's rather simplistic, predictable and generally unlikely (but that's a writer's stock in trade I guess). Still it does close out the first story arc (assuming they are planning a second). They have left it wide open for another season (or two). All this aside, while not my favorite of the three it is still a good watch and I'd say it was worth the price and time. As a whole the series was good with most areas being above average. May be suitable for teens or even children, but watch it first. We all have different opinions on what's okay for kids.",1284768000,,894,4.391566265060241
