6675139,5,B00NPBIEZE,The message and story line of Dying To Be Heard are outstanding!  My wife and I watched it after I received an email recommending it and we are both glad we did. We have talked about the content and implications for days after seeing the movie.  We both also enjoyed seeing some inside views of Orthodox Messianic Jewish life.,1453075200,,326,4.508474576271187
6675140,5,B00NPBIEZE,"I watched this last night and I'm glad I did. We all have a story to tell or those moments when we feel completely and utterly abandoned. In this movie, Rachel, is a high-powered executive who has just been promoted. As she and some friends celebrate her success over drinks, laughs, and good times, Rachel happens to catch the eye of a young man. They continue to drink and have a good time, even ""hooking up."" Once she discovers she's pregnant, Rachel is forced to choose between climbing the ladder of success or keeping the child. She is lost, hurt, confused, and tries to hide her natural beauty by fake nails, too much makeup, wig, etc. In the midst of all her hardship, she encounters a homeless, but very compassionate man who tries to talk to her about Jesus and His Love for us. He even goes so far as to tell her that he will pray for her. Rachel of course thinks he's just a crazy old man and initially blows him off with snarky comments. Yet, he continues his kindness. After some soul searching, Rachel discovers what she wants and chooses to follow her heart. The end  credits indicated this is based on many true stories. It is for sure well worth watching. I wouldn't mind watching it again.",1437868800,7,1208,4.46606334841629

6675145,1,B00NPBIEZE,"I didn't like the Christian slant to the film, especially since the description did not indicate that it was a Christian film.  I also thought it was pretty disorganized.",1463788800,,170,4.862068965517241

6675150,1,B00NPBIEZE,Never really got the point.  I guess it is a movie about pro-lifers.,1463702400,,68,4.230769230769231
6675151,1,B00NPBIEZE,"Terrible, terrible movie - some sort of super religious, anti abortion movie with terrible over acting, terrible lines, don't know why this is on Amazon.

6675158,1,B00NPBIEZE,"This movie was made for the Duck Dynasty and Sarah Palin types who have no education, not any clue about science/technology and cannot see the stupidity of the arguments about religion.  A God so powerful who can shape the universe yet intent to make humans suffer so his capricious ego is aggrandized by those victimized by circumstance or planned by maggots living off human misery....This is also a anti-choice, anti-woman's rights, and anti-human movie.  If you are dumb and want to watch something dumber, this is your movie....",1463097600,,533,5.045454545454546

6675170,1,B00NPBIEZE,This was terrible.  The message is confused and misleading.  The acting is very poor.  Don't be mislead by any 5 star reviews that have likely been created by endorsers of the movie.  This is simply a self-promoting poorly written drama to promote a confused message from evangelical Christians who once identified as Jewish.,1453075200,4,325,5.0754716981132075

8679665,5,B00NPBIEZE,"The movie's message is especially needed in our generation.  What is truly important in life?  Is the value of a life determined by how high of a rung one can reach on the corporate ladder?  Or by something else?  Not only is the question answered, it is done through an entertaining and engaging story.  I found the acting exceptional, especially by the female lead.

Bottom line:  This is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen.",1492300800,,438,4.538461538461538
