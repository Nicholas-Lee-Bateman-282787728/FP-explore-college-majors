8050581,3,B0007QQW4A,"The description of this video includes the words, ""strums"" and ""strumming"" but leaves out a very important point.  Even though there are a lot of very good demonstrations of rhythms, there are very few strums, and everything is done with a Thumb Pick and Finger Picks.  There is NOTHING done with a Flat Pick.  Yes, some of the rhythms can be imitated with a flat pick, but if you are looking for strums with a flat pick, there is nothing here for you.  I was looking specifically for flat picking rhythms, so was disappointed with this DVD.",1483488000,,541,4.546391752577319
8050582,1,B0007QQW4A,This was completely opposite of what I expected. to me the instructor was just showing off. I would have returned it but didn't want the hassle.,1427068800,,144,4.576923076923077
8050583,5,B0007QQW4A,"If you already know your cords and at least a couple of progressions you will tremendously benefit from this DVD. If you have problems syncopating, you are bored with playing the same rhythm over and over again, if you want to enrich your rhythmic vocabulary or simply become a better player I highly recommend you to get this video. Bob Brosman generously shares the secrets that in my opinion make the difference between been an aficionado and becoming a proficient guitar player. He starts from the basics, in fact he starts the class without using the guitar but his bare hands and his feet and moves gradually to show you complex rhythms and polyrhythms that are make you want to dance. This is without a doubt one of the best instructional DVDs I own. And trust me, I own a lot.",1288483200,9,784,4.567375886524823
8050584,5,B0007QQW4A,"I disagree with the previous reviewer who stated that this video is ""short on instruction"".  It's all instruction.  Bob doesn't teach you how to play songs in this video, which I like, but teaches you how to be immersed in the groove rather than the chord progression/pattern.  Shifting your focus to rhythm rather than the action.

Mr. Brozman clearly walks through hand and foot-tapping exercises, picking and strumming styles; accents, swing rhythms, polyrhythms & triplets.  He does move through them quickly, only spending a few minutes on each part, so pause and rewind will get used a lot.

The video description says it all: The ability to change and improve your instrumental arrangements through rhythmic variations is at the heart of this lesson.

Mr. Brozman does a fine job of teaching in my opinion and this video will help make your own arrangements more colorful.  It did mine.

That's my two cents.",1267660800,12,915,4.967105263157895
8050585,2,B0007QQW4A,"My best advice is if you can benefit from this DVD you don't need it. If that makes any since.  Bob Brozman is a brilliant guitarist, not a teacher.  The DVD is very short on instruction and long on watching him play full speed with very little explanation or break down of what he is doing. If your a beginner or intermediate guitar player you need to go with something a little more basic.",1111622400,17,391,4.27027027027027
