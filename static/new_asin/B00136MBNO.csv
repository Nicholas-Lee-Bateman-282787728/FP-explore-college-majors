3102580,5,B00136MBNO,"This video is a look into the technologies that could be applied to our daily lives in the very near future.  A series of interviews and commentary from physicists, inventors and authors related to the scientific community from around the world.

This video is very eyeopening and makes you wonder why these ideas haven't been pursued on a large scale earlier in our history. Everything from complete electric vehicles to devices that can power your home indefinitely.

It is a shame that these ideas are not more widely discussed on the world stage. Inevitably they will have to be acknowledged at some point.  Maybe this one review can help that ripple of information along.  I give this video 5 stars based solely on the information it provides.

For those of you into metaphysics you will find this video very entertaining as well.

8249328,2,B00136MBNO,"Boeing Aviation took 2 Ford Flex engines from a Ford Ranger and created a drone that ran on hydrogen. The wings were equipped with solar panels and scoops 2 intake water droplets from the air that were converted into hydrogen to add to the fuel while flying. This allowed the Drone to fly almost endlessly. If we want to get away from oil-based / carbon-based fuel systems all we need to do is put a few solar panels on our roof and begin making hydrogen and storing it in a tank container at the house. Convert the Ford Flex engine to run on propane and it will also run on hydrogen. Solar panels charging lithium base batteries can create hydrogen and oxygen in a hydrogen fuel container system. It's simple it's easy it's inexpensive.
It's no more dangerous than having your propane tank store next to your house that heat your home. And the cost range is between $2,500 to $3,500.

Rolex watches has a ceramic bezel that is made so tough that it must be engraved and etched prior to being fired in the kilm. This ceramic material is so strong that we could make an engine out of ceramic and reduce the weight of our current heavy metal engines by a 2/3 margin. The ceramic material would last longer be wear resistant be lubricated by teflons instead of oils and would likely be impervious to overheating and seizing as in Steel or aluminum engine blocks. As Ceramics do not expand like steel does.",1517443200,2,1402,4.4980392156862745
8249329,2,B00136MBNO,"This video would seem to be well over ten years old, probably between 10 and 20-years somewhere.  All of these inventors claiming over unity also claim the revolution is just slightly around the corner and they're struggling being short of funding.  Some have been threatened, jailed, or worse because the powers that be get their wealth from the fossil-burning fuels we pay dearly for and aren't about to let that be crushed under the paradigm shift of free energy.  I'm cynical and suspicious.  I think I'm just being pragmatic because none of these inventors have made commercially successful ventures based on any kind of over-unity technology.  I have faith there is a lot of energy surrounding us invisibly (i.e. think the warmth of the sun for instance), but nothing here has come to a fully realized game changing device that will transport me, cool/warm me, or otherwise enable me to cut the cord.  I wish someone would give us a documentary about this stuff that was so real we could see something people are widely using and is being made available to the public in a widespread way.  As it is I can't believe anything here.  Dr. Tom Bearden should have sat this one out because now I'm suspicious of him and he's living not far from me in Huntsville, Alabama so I wanted to believe.",1516233600,2,1294,4.6946902654867255
8249330,2,B00136MBNO,"This video attempts to convince the viewer that various shade-tree inventors are on the verge of revolutionizing the world with low-power free-energy devices that can, among other things, return more energy than is invested, defy gravity, and even transmute elements.  In other words, these unsung geniuses are going to revolutionize the world through alchemy.  The fact that some of these geniuses sound more like late-night infomercial salesmen than serious inventors (and that one of them was imprisoned for his activities) does not make a convincing case for zero-point energy.  Most ridiculous is the segment devoted to the crackpot huckster John Hutchison, the guy who used to ""levitate"" numerous items in his garage on the Discovery and National Geographic channels until he was exposed as a fraud (whereupon, he claimed the U.S. government stole his technology and used it to destroy the World Trade Center on 9/11).  Granted, there are one or two featured inventors with gizmos that appear not too far-fetched; however, it only takes one bad apple to spoil the barrel, and there are a few bad apples in this video.",1514851200,7,1123,5.153846153846154

8249332,5,B00136MBNO,Much of the information in this film continues to be suppressed by main-stream science. Imagine one-day energy will be free to everyone. This film is proof of that.
