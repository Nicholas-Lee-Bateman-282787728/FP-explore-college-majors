4245234,4,B0041KT3NA,"First off, I'm a fan of Aidan Turner's work with that said...this film was slowly paced, with plenty of twist and turns, to keep the viewer guessing, and that is where the problem with this film lie. The main Character Molly suffers from anxiety and paranoia after having witnessed her fathers murder. upon losing her father Molly is taken in by a elderly couple, who knew her father. The couple who happens to be childless, takes a special liking to Molly, and soon becomes over protective of her. The couple attempts to guilt Molly into remaining home with them, but Molly finds the courage to put her feet down, and decides to move ahead with her plan to move. Molly has balked out of a additional five grand, on the home she is purchasing by some, shady realtor looking to pad his own pockets. Molly completes the deal moves into her new place, notices that she never see's any of her neighbors during the day, or night for that matter,and begins to question her community. She soon decides to throw a house warming party for dear friends, in which she is introduced to a handsome man, whom she soon becomes fast friends with. Fast forward ahead, and their not only dating but living together, and he (Mal aka Aidan) learns of Molly's mental short-comings and takes it upon himself to guard and protect her, following a two break in's one of which he's injured in. Mal's behavior and intentions are soon called into question by Molly, who begins to feel that Mal and her surrogate parents are hiding something from her. Molly's begins to question wither she is being paranoid, or if she's being set up to believe that she is paranoid.
The break in this tedious film is when Mal turns to Molly and states, all of these things that are happening to you are not connected. These things that have happened is only a coincidence.
Basically Mal  admits to taking certain liberties with Molly's' safety in order to keep her dependent on him, the surrogate grandparents never had children, and had silently made the decision to make her their child, and the three break in's she endured, was concocteced by the neighborhood hardware suppliers brother, looking to drum up business. Everyone in Molly's life used her for their own dependent and selfish reasons, well leaving her with the impression that she was going crazy.
If it were not for the incredible performances I would have asked Amazon for my money back! this movie lift me with so many more questions then answer's. Questions such as: How long did Molly's father know this old couple?  What happened to her mother? Why didn't the elderly couple ever have kids of their own? why were the old couple so fixated on her? What happened to Molly's friend who introduced her to Mal? What did Mal do for a living? Where in the world did Mal live? What did Molly do for a living? and so on! the list of questions just grows bigger, every time I begin thinking over the movie. I didn't feel a sense of closure after watching this movie. Molly freaks out and kills Mal after she discovers he's been playing with her alarm system, or had he? she killed him before she could get the freakin' answer! I want my money back!  other then that the performances was great, well acted, believable, and flawless. The script on the other hand is questionable.
I did feel like Molly as I was watching her plight unfold, and to the credit of the director he did a magnificent job making me feel what Molly was enduring, day to day- that part of the movie was genus. So I suppose the the question becomes wither or not Molly was fighting through a series of unfortunate events, that happened to be a coincidence, or was she indeed being set up, to believe that she was truly delusional. I walked away feeling she was set up to believe that she was going crazy, those who was supposed to care for her, so that they could control her. Mall, the old people, and the star clerk, played with her mind to satisfy their own greedy needs.",1301961600,6,3962,4.561797752808989

4245248,5,B0041KT3NA,"WOW - this was quite the psychological thriller! It has so much packed into it, I have had to watch it 3-4 times to catch everything.

4245253,4,B0041KT3NA,"I don't think I've given anything away here but.....After a great deal of soul searching, I have decided that I liked this movie. Directed by Gerard Stembridge, he poses a very interesting story of is she insane or isn't she and if she isn't, if there a conspiracy to drive her mad? The lady in question is ruth Bradley and she is playing this character to the hilt. her new boyfriend who is very concerned about her or is he? is played by Aidan turner (BBC Being Human). did I like it, yes I did but there were questions that didn't get answered, what always happens to the dog? did he run away? the bicycle? the alarm? the ending is one of those....you decide what it is. they don't tell you and it is up to the viewer. The whole cast is as the British Say ""spot on"" If you come up with an ending.....let me know.",1446249600,5,815,4.197452229299363
4245254,4,B0041KT3NA,pretty good little movie.  aidan turner in one of his very early performances on film is fantastic. you are never sure if he is a bad guy or a good guy.  there are two pretty explicit sex scenes. the writing is a bit uneven and not all of the questions raised are answered at least to my satisfaction..all in all it is worth watching just for aidan turner's performance.,1444867200,3,370,4.3478260869565215

4245268,4,B0041KT3NA,"Suspense thriller with amazing actor who's about to become a giant Star!  An early film (2008) before he became known for Being Human TV series and The Hobbit Trilogy as Kili the Dwarf!  He has amazing range, just gorgeous, and a very down to earth person who has not been spoileby d by success.  Early effort when he was just a few years out of drama school.  Handsome, sexy Irish actor destined for stardom",1442448000,3,408,4.472972972972973
4245269,5,B0041KT3NA,"so much better than the US version. I loved all three characters..they compliimented ea other beautifully...The only thing I questioned was the episode where Mitchell sacrificed himself for the good of the world..Annie obviously loved him so if that were me, I would have been crying my eyes out..inconsolable...same with George...but other than that, I watch it over and over from beginning to end..",1441929600,3,400,5.265625

4245272,3,B0041KT3NA,"Aidan Turner was the reason I purchased it.  The plot left you hanging, which I do not like.  Don't want to leave a spoiler for the movie.  It is a good past time movie especially if you are a Aidan Turner fan.",1437436800,3,210,3.9523809523809526
4245273,4,B0041KT3NA,"OK, so it's not ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Casablanca"".  It's not even ""Dirty Dancing"".  But it's twisty and intriguing and features some solid performances, and - most important of all - it's got Aidan Turner at his adorable best, with hair that hasn't been cut, tamed, or subjected to the unforgivable insult/assault of a hairbrush. If you're a Turner fan, it'll be a lovely ride.",1425772800,10,374,4.828125
4245274,5,B0041KT3NA,Really good movie.  Had an Alfred Hitchcock feel to it.,1423008000,,55,4.5
4245275,5,B0041KT3NA,Fair warning everyone the reviewer Anna Lee pretty much gives away the entire plot of the film in her review so if you don't want the film spoiled don't read it.,1420848000,,161,4.225806451612903
4245296,3,B0041KT3NA,The movie as a slow start and the ending left me a bit confused. The acting was good though and once the movie gets going it is pretty entertaining. Also if you are an Aidan Turner fan...lots of Aidan. He does a great job (as always) in the role of Mal.,1407456000,4,253,3.980392156862745

4245299,5,B0041KT3NA,"I chose the rating because, actually I would have given more than five stars. A great film. Beautifully acted
Oozing with tension, sex, and a great psychological element, as Molly descends further into her little world of paranoia Superbly acted by Ruth Bradley. Wouldn't trust that Frank a nd Jess though. But Molly's boyfriend..Wow! That gorgeous butt when he gets up in the morning. Sorry, too many spoilers. Great! Great! Great! Aidan Turner...Well, what else can I say?",1390435200,17,474,5.089743589743589
4245300,5,B0041KT3NA,"First of all, I think this is a pretty good film. It kept my interest and also has one of my favorite actors in it; Aidan Turner - who also stars in Peter Jackson's Hobbit films. The plot was a little confusing at times and the end was a complete shock but other than that - it was a great movie. I watch it as often as I can. ;)",1370822400,4,329,3.7142857142857144

4245302,3,B0041KT3NA,"When you find out what is actually going on, you sort of go ""Oh is that it? That's uhhh weird, I guess, but ok whatever."" Aidan Turner is very handsome in it - a lovely distraction from what I am sure they hoped would be a riveting plot line. If you are a fan of Turner's, it's a must have for your collection.",1364515200,3,310,3.9365079365079363
4245303,5,B0041KT3NA,"Loved this movie!  Definitely not for the faint of heart, it's a psychological thriller about one woman's decent into madness set in a suburb of Dublin.  Really showcases Ireland, and the acting is stellar.",1336953600,7,206,5.029411764705882
4245304,5,B0041KT3NA,"This is one of those movies that you think about long after you have watched it.  This is a thinking persons thriller, and I found it to be a sexy, intriguing thriller whose ending will haunt you.  We are familiar with the fine actor Aidan Turner, but mark my words - Ruth Bradley will soon become a household name.",1314835200,13,315,4.322033898305085
4245305,5,B0041KT3NA,"Alarm is a suspense thriller as good as any movie by Hitchcock: A young woman buys a house outside of Dublin to find mental peace- you may guess she does so in vain. She is introduced by a friend to a gorgeous boy with whom she falls in love at once. This mysterious man is played by young Irish actor Aidan Turner who is best known from the supernatural BBC series Being Human as Mitchell the guilt-ridden vampire seeking redemption. Turner ist not just another TV-star, but a highly -trained actor of almost incredible intensity, his voice is amazing and his great looks are second to none. He alone might be the reason to watch Alarm, but he other actors are also first-rate. Hurry to buy this movie- you won't regret ist !",1302566400,24,726,4.466165413533835

8412947,5,B0041KT3NA,"Wanted to see Aidan Turner's performance, rapidly becoming a fan.  A very different part from his others, he always plays a different character, doesn't repeat.  His very skilled acting can be ignored due to his physical look, but he is a very good actor.  The movie has an unresolved ending but it is interesting to come to your own opinions as to who was doing what.  It's good entertainment and I would recommend it.",1498435200,,419,4.621621621621622

8412950,3,B0041KT3NA,"I only purchased this film to get another look at Aidan Turner.  Although he is marvelous in anything I have seen, this is a very strange story and i unimpressed.

8412951,5,B0041KT3NA,"I thought it was done pretty well.  Acting was good (but I haven't seen much of Aidan Turners work, but like too). Quite a change of character fom Mal to Poldark - but that's good too.",1492819200,,184,4.111111111111111
8412952,3,B0041KT3NA,"Worth watching if you are an Aiden Turner fan.  If he were not in it, I would have rated film just two stars. As one of his very early films it shows his acting range potential and charisma.  However, the film itself was creepy and felt claustrophobic.  Perhaps that was intended.  The central woman character in the film, and the reason for the ""Alarm"", seemed an odd choice for lead since she was just not a very good actress. The other supporting actors were more talented. Other reviewers may have a less critical view.",1489104000,2,523,4.531914893617022

8412955,3,B0041KT3NA,"Basically it is an interesting movie. It is suspenseful. The acting for all actors is great. My problem is the ending does not explain tthe story, and gives no real conclusions to the main characters actions. It could have concluded the story in a clearer manner.",1485216000,,263,4.739130434782608
