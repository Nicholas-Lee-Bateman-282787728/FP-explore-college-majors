6959294,1,B00S58LN8C,"Please don't buy this.  Showing something like this to your kids will teach them all the wrong things - for example they will probably think that a monkey grinning like the one shown here is ""happy"" - which she is not (capuchin monkeys make that face when they are frightened or nervous).  They'll think that using a monkey as an ""actor"" is a fine thing to do, not understanding that in order to be trained as an actor a monkey is deprived of some of his or her most basic needs (such as the need to be with a social group with others of her own kind).  Monkeys are not like domestic animals, whether they were born in the wild or if they were born in captivity and hand-reared.  If you care about instilling your children with a healthy respect for other living things, please don't buy into the idea that films like this are cute or funny -  there are so many other good, fun, entertaining films to choose from!",1426636800,,913,4.315789473684211
6959295,1,B00S58LN8C,"To exploit a capuchin monkey for human entertainment is disgusting and cruel. Thumbs down for this film. Capuchins are complex social creatures which naturally require large home ranges and the company of their own kind, not to be dressed up like a human doll and forced to perform tricks for the camera! Shame on all those who buy this film and support this cruel trade!",1426550400,2,371,4.723076923076923

6959297,5,B00S58LN8C,I purchased this for my granddaughter and she couldn't wait to open it and watch it.  She was really impressed with the fact that we actually received it on the release date.  It made an 8yr. old very happy.,1426032000,2,207,4.282051282051282
6959298,4,B00S58LN8C,"This was a good and entertaining family movie. I enjoyed it as a big wrestling fan and especially enjoyed seeing former WWE star John Morrison as the antagonist in this film.

The story is pretty good and will keep kids and adult attention during the 1 hour 30 minute runtime. Actors are also good in this film, with the dog and monkey stealing the show of course!!!

The only things I did not like was the soundtrack. The music is extremely cheesy, and sounds straight from the 1980's or early 90's veign. And they also use the same cheesy song on more than one occasion. Also the special effects when the animals are talking are clearly computerized and not as slick as big budget movies.

Overall this was a fun little film, with a couple downsides. It will be great to watch with younger kids, and wrestling fans may want to check this out as a unique entry to a wrestling film collection. Good times can be had by all. **** 4 Stars",1425945600,5,936,4.398843930635838
6959299,5,B00S58LN8C,"This film is hilarious, adventurous and much more! It will appeal to kids as well as adults and has a very unique idea. Russell Madness is a perfect family story that will be enjoyed by many. Russell Madness has a feel of comedy with a wrap-around of family ties, while still having a core of wrestling and a little sprinkle of suspense.

The story starts when a family moves back to Oregon to take over an old wrestling ring which belonged to the family for a long time. It is a bit run down, but a new generation opens it back up. Then, during a first match, something very interesting happens. A dog named Russell (completely by coincidence) comes into the ring where a big tough and strong wrestler is. What happens next is absolutely unexpected and surprising.

This film is stupendous! Something I really like about it is that Russell's coach is a monkey named Hunk. And yes, it is a talking monkey, played by a very smart and adorable monkey named Crystal, except for the talking parts of course, which I think is a great and smart idea. The acting is wonderful and the whole film has that perfect amount of cheesiness, cuteness and positivity to make it a wonderful family film. Also, the jokes are original and hilarious.

My favorite scene is about the family's first encounter with Hunk. Hunk tells them to take in Russell as a family dog and offers to train Russell to be a wrestler. But, his price is many things doing with bananas. It is funny and an important scene in the movie.

I recommend for kids ages 5 to 18 and I give it 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic acting, production, directing, and unbelievable animal training. Don't miss it when it comes on DVD/Blu-ray/Digital March 10.

6959305,1,B00S58LN8C,"Russell Madness opens with a child going to pick out a puppy at a PET STORE. Not a rescue. Not a shelter. Not even a neighbor in need or a reputable and knowledgeable breeder who cares for the wellbeing of their animals.

This is not 1950. It should be pretty common knowledge by 2015 that puppies in pet stores come from puppy mills.

But it gets worse. Not only does Russell Madness present selling/buying puppies in pet stores as perfectly normal and healthy, ""Russell"" the dog is never purchased and grows up in the store: once he reaches a year old, he is threatened by human management with being sent to ""the pound."" Because that's where bad, unwanted, rejected dogs go who no one wants. All the nicest, best, most perfect dogs come from pet stores. Obviously.

""So remember, Children! Get to the pet store fast to buy your new dog. Don't adopt one from a nasty, unlovable rescue organization or animal shelter!""

Then there's the whole making movies with wild primates issue. Even born in captivity, you don't have to go many generations back to find a wild animal which was captured to be exploited for the profit and entertainment of humans. Incidentally, the starring capuchin monkey spends most of the film ""smiling,"" which is a sign of distress for capuchins. Even if this behavior is trained for the monkey to perform on cue, it continues to carry an emotional connection for the animal. Just another tragedy of Russell Madness.

If you do let children see this nonsensical and violent movie, please make sure they are old enough to have a discussion about the barbaric truth behind puppy mills and pet stores which profit by keeping this practice alive in America and beyond.",1435363200,,1690,4.73469387755102
