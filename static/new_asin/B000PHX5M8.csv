2822378,5,B000PHX5M8,"When Soul Food aired back 7 years ago- I was so proud to see us reflected positively and not sterotypical.  I am so thankful to the fans who petitioned Showtime to release the highly anticipated Season 2!!! For a long time I had been thinking the same thing like ""when are they going to release season 2? Well I'm glad someone stepped up and made a difference in our viewing rights! After all we have kept the season alive during its peak and post its departure.. I'm ordering mine!

This was really a great show. I watch the re-runs on BET and get so caught up as if it's my first time and I don't know how it'll end.",1181865600,6,349,4.369230769230769

It tooks lot of calls, e-mails, and petitions to get Showtime to release this masterpiece.

Better late than never.

I believe August is the release date.

Regardless, I am placing my order in hope of getting the DVDs sooner than August.",1179532800,6,342,4.633333333333334

2822396,5,B000PHX5M8,I loved this series when it was on TV.  I had been looking to complete the box set for my collection and this was the last season that I was missing.  I was losing hope when I couldn't find it at local stores.  The response time from the seller was awesome and the product arrived in excellent condition.,1388707200,,304,4.206896551724138

2822398,5,B000PHX5M8,"Our media world is stretched and publishers, advertisers and production companies are fighting for our attention.  Still, the African American market that is adult, astute, amalgamated and looking for just a little bit more then Tyler Perry is without a drama that appeals to OUR culture.  While Scandal may be taking us by storm, the real scandal is why media investors do not understand....after so much proof, that creators like Shonda Rhimes (the creator of SCANDAL, GREYS ANATOMY and an African American woman) can mold and melt a story line and move it from a cultural story to an American saga.  Oh, and by the way, I do believe Shonda penned SOUL FOOD.  So here's to a drama that leads us to where we need to be as African Americans - strengthens our families, tells our real story at various levels, makes the world take us seriously.  SOUL FOOD, I miss you.  We................miss you.",1358985600,,896,4.785714285714286
2822399,5,B000PHX5M8,"As much I loved the first season, I really enjoyed Season Two of Soul Food. If you have seen the first season, you'll definitely want to see this as season one ended with a cliff hanger, naturally. This season was entertaining, writing was a little different from first season, yet was good. I highly recommend the TV series, indeed so. A must own collection for your home DVDs.

Thanks.",1332633600,,387,4.608695652173913

love this dvd",1295049600,,86,3.5789473684210527
2822404,5,B000PHX5M8,"Well I have to say that I am so excited to finally own my own copy of the second season. I am so excited!!! My husband and I would pay extra for show time during the seasons of soul food just to watch soul food! That is the only reason we would pay extra for cable.. I remember I could not wait to get home to watch soul food with my husband. It was the show to watch!

We waited and waited to buy this series because it was sooooooooo expensive... I will say that it was worth the wait and worth the deal that we received. So I am double excited about finally owning this series. We now can watch soul food anytime and as many times as I want!

Which is great since there is really nothing good on TV...... now a days.............

As far as the series being edited, yes it would be nice if all of the scenes were left as they aired on showtime. I don't understand what the reason was for the editing. The rating on amazon states unrated.

For us, we still wanted the series as we wanted to see for ourselves what was edited out. So far we are enjoying the series the way it is, The scenes are as we remember them, we will continue to watch to see what was and was not edited out.

We will be watching this, over this holiday season and into and through out the new year.. Just in time for the holidays!

We were looking for something to watch for the holidays and every year we usually add a few new DVD's to our collections. This makes a great addition!

I don't want to give any spoilers away, all I can say is that we were hooked on this series the first time we watched!

And now to the great part of it all. We only paid $8.00 plus tax for the first series and $9.00 plus tax for the second series! What a deal!

Well, I found season three on amazon and lost it while in my cart. It is okay, because I ended up getting a better deal. So now all I need is the final season. I will make an update about the conditions of the order once, I receive the order. I am so excited about the amount I saved. It was not meant for me to have the first one that I selected as it was more expensive due to it being new. So for now I will continue to watch season one and two! I will be glad when more series or movies are made that are similar to soul food and this is a very positive series. Well back to season one!

**************2012 update**********************
We are still loving this series, as we own the whole set. We pulled the plug on cable due to the waste of money we were spending over a year and also because to us there was really nothing good on. So we are happy that we have the Soul food series to view! This series is so much fun, entertainment, worth viewing over and over, we never become tired of watching this series. You can not watch just one episode. You will want to go from season to season. I thought that each set was packaged well and that the quality of the DVD's is great.

If you have not purchased this T.V. Series you are missing out. You will laugh, cry, jump for joy, feel happy, feel warmth and be entertained to the fullest!

Every episode has something to offer and shows different aspects of life in many different ways. The scenery is very colorful and the homes and lifestyles of every character can and will teach you great lessons.

I will keep my hope up for more T.V. Series like this that will come on regular T.V. There is really not that many great shows on T.V. in the current T.V. business and cable shows the same things over and over. So having this to view after a long day of work brings joy, peace, and just time well spent in front of the T.V.

My husband and I love to watch this series together. And I like the fact that this series shows men in positive rolls and taking care of their family. For single women, it also shows what they go through and how tough it is for them. All walks of life can be found in this series.. Great for showing how family can be and should be.. Love the family dinners, as my family and I used to have family dinner every Sunday with our great grandmother we are in the process of reorganizing family dinners!

Enjoy and Happy watching to you!",1289779200,,4131,4.107940446650124
2822405,5,B000PHX5M8,"This is a great show, with sensitively written episodes exploring everything from mental illness, to family inheritance squabbles, to sibling rivalry, to race relations, to raising children, to teenage love, to dating, to women in the workplace... phew, I could go on and on! Honestly, this show covers it all - and then some! It deals with real-life issues in an honest, frank, yet complex and multi-layered way. The acting is wonderful - this is a true ensemble cast, with moving performances by all the actors, all of whom are given some really challenging storylines to deal with. Season 2 of the show was great, with Terri and Damon's relationship falling apart, Terri's workplace problems, Terri's psychological issues, Maxine and Kenny's marital drama, Kenny's business expansion, Lem's legal woes, Bird's search for freedom and independence... wow, I could go on and on, but please just trust me... this is a great season of a great show, dealing sensitively with a wide range of issues. Buy it, watch it, love it. Oh and by the way, this show is for 'grown folk'... be prepared for a fair amount of nudity, sexual situations and profane language. I don't think it's excessive, but there's a pretty fair amount of it, so if you'd rather not see those things, 'Soul Food' isn't for you.",1282521600,,1293,4.881818181818182
2822406,1,B000PHX5M8,I am still waiting for my DVD of Soul Food 3rd Season. I should have trusted my instincts and ordered directly from Amazon not a seperate seller. The first seller I bought my season 2 from was great and timely! I even paid extra for expedited shipping and it still isn't here! I have been waiting well over a week and a half now and the expected maximum delivery was August 29th. This sucks!,1251763200,,391,4.297297297297297

2822409,5,B000PHX5M8,I searched high and low for the best price for the Soul Food Complete Series and Amazon was my final decision.

2822412,5,B000PHX5M8,"Last year I bought season one of this series for my husband's birthday. We have watched all of the episodes from that season except for the last episode. My husband refused to watch it until he received the second season. Alas! I got it for him for his birthday this year 3/31 and he was excited. So, tonight, we have a date to continue watching from where we left off and delve into season two. I can't wait! I've seen some of the episodes on television before, but it is still a thrilling experience and to watch them all over again with my husband who is a bigger fan than I am, is awesome.

I await Season 3 ;)",1207094400,,614,4.159663865546219
2822413,4,B000PHX5M8,"Like a lot of reviewers, I fell in love with this show during its 2nd season run on Showtime. I actually taped the series but don't really have time to compare what they've cut or edited - I have noticed that musically Kina & Ludicrous were edited out as well as the music featured in their favorite hangout has been edited out so it does look strange to see them ""jammin in the club"" to some smooth jazz styled ""muzak"".  I'm angered about the fact that fans who lobbied so hard to get this series on dvd have to pay premium prices for a sub-par product.

But be that as it may, this season was truly entertaining with strong storylines for not only the Joseph Sisters but their men as well.  My favorite storylines are:

* Terry's battle with panic attacks, attempts to help her family after the accident and on-the-job struggles
* Terry & Damon's breakup, his struggle to get his business off the ground & his affair with Christine
* Bird's ""growing pains"" after her recovery from the accident
* Lem's Mama drama
* Ahmad standing up for Maxine when Kenny lashes out at her one too many times
* Maxine & Kenny's break-up/Maxine confronting Lila

And the most hilarious backstory concerned Lem & Bird's use of a massage oil which causes a rash.

I only wish that CBS/Paramount had added extras - interviews, back stage segments AND detailed info regarding what scenes were edited.

All in all, I spent a very enjoyable weekend watching the entire series and would recommend it to fans of this groundbreaking series.",1203206400,,1515,4.588888888888889

However i am ABSOLUTELY dissappointed with the deletion of scenes (not to mad about the music change up, i understand the contractual constraints) no matter how minute or innocently intended.  If this is a trend for the remaining 3 seasons or so i think i am just going to stick to renting.  Paramount, whats worth doing is worth doing WELL!!!!!!",1188345600,2,607,4.733333333333333

We weren't painted in a light that always had us as thugs or buffons. It showed all of our sides, good and bad. If you want to see Season 3,4 and 5 you have to buy this Season and go back and try and buy Season 1. And don't buy it from a barbershop!!!!

Being in the UK, we do not always get to see shows like these and have to rely on DVDs. Thank the Lord. All I will say is that when it arrived............................... Second Season was enough to have me indoors for a WHOLE weekend (there's 16 hours of it). That said it only makes you even more frustrated that Season 3 isn't out. Well worth it................. NO QUESTIONS ASKED!!!!",1187740800,,503,4.6

Soul Food was the greatest show of all times they need to hurry up and release 3,4,and 5 and not wait another 5 years for the next season to come out.

2822436,5,B000PHX5M8,"What an incredible work of art and the cast, producers, Showtime, Paramount, should be proud!  Even with the deleted music and edited version - Soul Food the series season 2 is awesome.  I thought I would need to order another season 1 because I watched it so much!  I am buying copies as gifts for the Holidays.  I can't wait for the next 3 seasons.  Let's hope Paramount is working out the details so that they can give us the complete series.  Wouldn't it be fun to have a reunion show - but then we would never get enough and we would want more!",1187222400,2,549,4.230769230769231
2822437,5,B000PHX5M8,"I have the Season 1 box set, and I just purchased the Second Season box set. I can't believe they edited scenes...WTH for?!  As noted on many other reviews, it's a box set..slap a PA (Parental Advisory) sticker on it & call it a day!  (music rights & all...ok, I understand that) but I would almost wager money that they edited some of the ah...how to word it so that it's not crude...""spicier, intimate"" scenes (and I mean, 10-Alarm firehouse chili HOTTTTT)!!!  Or...how about a 2nd release with a stronger rating..with all such scenes included!

Meanwhile..I'm just happy it is finally here..if for no other reason than to continue the consistency in my DVD collection, and more importantly, to show Paramount & Showtime that yes..we still love our Soul Food..and we are anxiously awaiting the release of the other seasons...as unchopped as possible, please & thank you.  LOL

BTW, I saw one post from someone asking about the whereabouts of the other cast members..isn't ""Kenny"" on a new hospital-setting show on Fox or Lifetime? ""Bird"" was recently in Tyler Perry's movie, Daddy's Little Girls (good movie); ""Lem"" was in Stomp the Yard (another good one); ""Maxine"" was in some low-budget horror flick where the real main characters were big ol' spiders;  ""Damon"" was in that movie The Gospel -  check imdb.com for more info though.",1186790400,3,1335,4.902222222222222
2822438,5,B000PHX5M8,"I will never understand why this show was canceled, way too soon. It certainly was as good as, if not better than Girlfriends which is going into its -- what? -- zillionth season! And all the lead actors were just extraordinarily black, beautiful and talented. And where are each of them now? I miss them. I miss this show!",1186704000,2,323,4.491525423728813
2822439,5,B000PHX5M8,"I have to agree with some of the other viewers, 1. It shouldn't have taken four years to release season two when they are digging up old series from the 70's and above and putiing them out like crazy. 2. Why was it necessary to delete some scenes and music it's a DVD for peaks sake make it a R rating and press on. Finally I too, hope it doesn't take another 4 years for season three and others to follow. If we didn't like it or support it we wouldn't have made such a big deal about it. I love Soul Food, the original and the series. Hopefully they are already working on season 3.",1186617600,3,584,4.043103448275862
2822440,5,B000PHX5M8,I have also waited paitiently for the release of Seson 2 and it was well worth the wait.,1186617600,,88,3.9444444444444446
2822441,4,B000PHX5M8,"I've always love this series from the first day it aired on Showtime and I'm been anxiously awaiting the release of the series on DVD.  I bought season 1 and was scared that they'd never release season 2. Well, now the time has finally come.  I've purchased my copy of season 2 and I was a bit disappointed.  I had already heard that some of the music was editted out, but unfortunately, some scenes are as well.  I've only been able to watch the 4 episodes on the first DVD and the 1st episode on the 2nd one.  What didn't make much sense is. the singer Kina is announced in the club, yet you don't see her nor do they play her music.  They also cut out scenes where Teri meets Kristine at Damon's and the scene where Bird returns to the shop for the 1st time since the accident.  Also, in the first episode in the season, the opening credits say there will be an appearance by Nicki Micheaux (Lyla), yet, I never saw her in that episode.  These are just some things I've noticed so far, and I haven't even seen all 5 discs yet.  This has disappointed me quite a bit.  However, it's still better than the BET version, so it's worth the money.  I just don't understand why was it such a problem with contractural rights that the series couldn't be released, uneditted like 'Friends' or 'Seinfeld'.  The same thing with 'Girlfriends'-they had all sorts of issues with DVD release and contracts/rights, so it took forever to release the series.  Is it that people on the black tv series' just can't get along?  What is the deal?

Anyway, I'm still very excited to have season 2 and hopefully it doesn't take as long to release the remaining seasons.  I'm also hoping they're not as ""chopped up"" like they did with season 2.",1186617600,6,1721,4.39873417721519

OK they've been running the episodes on BET and BET-J nonstop but its nothing like an unedited, commercial free, watch at your out leisure, African American (non-stereotypical) drama! YAY !!!!!

I guess all that petitioning worked!",1186444800,,397,4.925373134328358
2822444,3,B000PHX5M8,"As I've been excited about the release of the second season of Soul Food, I was a little discouraged when I happened to see a copy of the series at a local store. My reasoning was due to the fine print that was located on the back of the box set. The print read that some of the music has been changed and some episodes have been edited from their original network airings. My excitement in buying the series quickly died once I found this out. If this is the actual case, then I will be a very dissatisfied customer. Also, why would they do such a thing after making die-hard fans wait nearly four years for another DVD box set?",1186185600,7,629,4.206611570247934

2822446,5,B000PHX5M8,"Oh my God!  I have prayed for so long for the second season to be released. I did not miss any episode of Soul Food when it was on Showtime and it was my only reason for subscribing to Showtime.  Soul Food had a strong fan base and they felt slighted by Paramont for not releasing more seasons.  I am one of many who have sent emails and phone calls and I will not stop until all seasons are released. Yes, it did air on BET but the shows are not shown in order and there are too many comercials and deleted scenes.
I cannot wait until my order comes because I plan to watch it immediately.
Please tell all your friends to purchase this DVD set (not the bootleg copies) in order for Paramont to continue releasing the other seasons.",1185494400,2,732,4.177304964539007

To have had a black family portrayed in such a positive manner was truly something beautiful and heart felt . I have been waiting for the second season since forever . My only prayer is that dispite what Paramount may or would like to receive in sales concerning this item that they do not make us wait any more years befor the following seasons fall in place to be released . So to all those who kept the faith and prayed as I did stay strong and keep holding on !!! How could we not give it five hell a hundred stars.

2822453,5,B000PHX5M8,"I am so excited to have this second season available.  It is unfortunate that it took this long, but sometimes good things have to come in their own time.  The first season has brought many thoughtful, reflective, and inspirational moments into my space.  Yes, periodically I have to watch it to get my fix on just how valuable that program was to a lot of viewers.  Universal themes handled with savvy, never pretending that we are more than human after all.  Stories of a continuing sereis that capture the good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful of what it means to be human.  Human foibles are what they are, but they are not the end of the world.  Soul Food helped us to see that we do make it through even the tough times.

Welcome Season Two!!!  I've nearly worn Season One to shreds.  I've been waiting patiently for your arrival.  I know what you brought before and anticipate that I will be equally delighted as the circle continues.  I hope Seasons 3-5 will closely follow the release of this season.
