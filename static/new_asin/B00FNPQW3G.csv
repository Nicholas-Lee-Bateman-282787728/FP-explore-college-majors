8617251,5,B00FNPQW3G,"This is a must see Documentary for all to see.
Pharmaceutical Companies are no longer spending on R & D as there is nothing in it for them financially.
What sort of world do we live in. Super Bugs resistant. Normal Antibiotics bacterial infections have become resistant & have been over used by People including the food industry ie. Chicken.
The problem is with these Super Bugs is they keep mutating and become used to one Antibiotic then another eventually resistant to all. So we must keep a step ahead and this is expensive. Hence no one is interested in this very expensive research.
This type of drug Companies do not make money from so we may go back Pre 1945 when we were only still experimenting with the new miracle drug Antibiotics.",1469318400,,744,4.601503759398496

Watch this first then watch the other DVD which explains the bigger picture of the whole story. It is amazing that Troy was admitted for a very complicated medical procedure to save his life but ended up dealing with KPC... The staff of NIH deserve a thank you for their honesty.",1413936000,,443,4.349397590361446

8617255,3,B00FNPQW3G,"This program showed two examples of Americans affected by bugs that current antibiotics could not cure.  My heart goes out to them and their families.  A pharmacist acquaintance  lightheartedly stated to me a few weeks ago, ""Well, in the distant future, there will be a superbug that humans can't cure that will wipe us out.""  This program suggests this may be slowly happening already.
The program tried to be accessible to audiences of different educational levels.  However, I do suspect that some of the discussion may go over some viewers' heads.  The conclusion suggested this program will have a Part Two that focuses upon the meat we eat and the antibiotics which may destroy it and then us.
Two things greatly surprised me here.  The program begins by showing a girl who needed a lung transplant.  I am so glad her story was a successful one, but I kept thinking, ""Now how can an ordinary American family afford this much healthcare!?""  The program says nothing of it, but I suspected that the girl's needs are of the severity that make families have to sell their homes or enter bankruptcy.  Second, a hospital admitted that they could not explain why a patient with a superbug seemed to have spread it to many others in the ICU.  Some of those to whom it spread died.  The facts behind Typhoid Mary began to enter my head.  I am surprised the hospital was so forthcoming as the admission seems like it would open a flood of potential law suits.  I think a family could argue, ""Even if no negligence occurred, my family received a superbug they would not have gotten in the real world and we want compensation for that.""  I appreciate that the hospital was so forthcoming, but highly surprised by it.
Frontline always makes programs with dignity and style and intelligence.  This program is no exception, but the subject matter may scare and horrify many.",1390262400,5,1865,4.727554179566564
8617256,5,B00FNPQW3G,"This documentary is as exciting and scary as any suspense movie, not only providing explanations for how and why some bacteria has become immune to most- if not all- drugs available but showing actual patients and describing specific cases where people died or were permanently affected by bacterial infections - even as doctors struggled to find an effective drug to save them.

Although I knew that deaths due to infections of  antibiotic resistant bacteria were on the rise, I didn't know that they are already a significant threat.  The reality? Bacteria have formed defenses against antibiotics far sooner than many experts predicted (and those who did raise the alarm were ignored far too often).

This film convinced me that life- threatening bacterial infections are no longer uncommon events. And it could be just a matter of time before a pandemic is likely. When will a bacteria appear which is not only  impervious to all antibiotics but easily spread through the world's population?

Grim as this seems, there are still options. Even if we can't prevent the rise of super strong bacteria, we still have choices we can make daily to help reduce risk. The film describes some of those options.

It is clear that much could have been done to slow the evolution of these ""super"" bacteria : not prescribe and take antibiotics at the first sign of illness, use a wait and see approach until a minor infection worsens, etc. Every dose of an antibiotic gives bacteria another chance to become resistant.

Very strongly recommended.",1389312000,5,1536,4.97265625
