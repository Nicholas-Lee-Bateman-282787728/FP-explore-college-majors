It took me 3 days to recover from the emotional scar I got from this title. I should have seen this coming beforehand though, because all his titles were kind cruel and can serve as great reflection of society in a bad way. To conclude, tough it out or turn away; if you came here solely for graphically sexual illustration, turn elsewhere because sex isn't the focus and scenes are short.

A few years later I got my hands on the uncut version and fell in love all over again. YES, this version contains graphic sexual scenes, and to the dips*** that went crazy saying ""it doesn't ad story value"" I disagree. By the end of the story you want Akai and Kanie's characters dead just as badly as you want Sawa to get vengeance for [spoiler removed].

2120280,2,B0002UB2YG,"I purchased this movie when I bought Mezzo Forte as this was made by the creators and was praised as a great anime.

I must say I was very disappointed with this movie. From the very begining all the way to the end there are numerous cut scenes and flashbacks that make this movie hard to follow and disrupt any flow whatsoever.

The one thing that annoyed me the most was the lack of a plot and dry character scenes mixed in with random sex/rape scenes and the always annoying cut scenes and flashbacks at very odd times this movie just never really gets going.

Eventually when I found out the main character was a teenage assassin and that her guardians are police detectives (apparently) in comes the secondary character and love interest to the first who somehow works for the same organization and kills accused child abusers/rapists as well. Though his background is never explained other then he had no parents as well.

Just when a small bit of a plot was forming the two detectives attempt to have the teenager boy assassin killed by sending him to kill fake targets who end up being prepared for him. After another sex/rape/cut scene/flashback, one of the the detectives is killed by the main character though it is never seen and the main character eventually finishes the main detective off and waits for her boyfriend..I guess? To come back but he is shot by a young girl he offended earlier on in the movie using the same gun he uses to kill. Which once more leads to plot questions as if she was the new assassin to replace him, her employers were now deceased and gleefully runs off to go play with her frieds after shooting someone. The movie gracefully concludes with the main character laying by the window of her boyfriend's house waiting for his return, not knowing he was shot the door opens and the movie ends.

As far as action goes there are numerous scenes of shootings and assassinations, but really there are only two actual gun fights that last more than a minute. One with the main character in the men's bathroom where she is sent to kill a movie star's brother. And the other scene where the teenage boy is sent to kill a business man who turns out to be a SWAT officer who was waiting for him.

All in all this movie is a confusing bundle consisting of numerous ill-timed and confusing cut scenes and flashbacks mixed in with the occasional sex/rape scene and a mixture of blood and a couple big action sequences to justify it's existence. The plot is minimal at best and very hard to follow.

I am unsure why others have claimed Mezzo Forte rode the success of this film, because Mezzo Forte is much better than this. Since this movie came out before Mezzo Forte, one can only assume the creators learned their lesson from this confusing movie.",1258502400,2,2779,4.557114228456914

2120288,3,B0002UB2YG,"Sawa is a young girl who kills a man with extreme prejudice for unknown reasons at first. Later, it's revealed that she's a well trained assassin. Armed with a pistol that uses exploding ammo, she deals out death in some gruesome ways for her employer named Akai.-summary

That is without a doubt the shortest summary I have ever written. Mainly because this OVA is very weak on its initial story. But make no mistake, Kite, which is directed by Yasuomi Umetsu has a tad bit more story than it first appears. Still, it could have been a much better title had the director focused more on the psychological thriller aspects of the movie, instead of dishing out mindless hentai that had little to no point, in regards to the plot or the story. As well as one very overdone action scene that crossed over into the complete absurd by the very second. I have seen this OVA at least three times since its release, and I still can't help but to roll my eyes every time I see that particular scene. Those who saw this know exactly what I'm talking about, because it's something Uwe Boll himself would be proud of.

I've heard many non fans say that this film is completely lacking in character development. I have to disagree with this point of view completely, because it appears that certain folks where searching for characters on the cheery side that they could relate to. This is simply not the case here, as Umetsu seeks to only exploit the negatives in human behavior. Sawa is developed rather well, as the viewer gets to know her through flashbacks, as well as the situations that goes on in her current life. There are many hints taking place which reveals Sawa as a very disturbed young girl who suffers from a traumatic past and a hellish present. Akai is a very twisted character who will be easy for people to hate.

 The plot is a mixed bag if I ever saw one. This is where Umetsu's weakness in storytelling shines, and proves that his ideas were quite limited. Instead of focusing a little bit more on Sawa and Akai's development. He goes the route of injecting many graphic sex scenes that really has nothing to do with the plot. The only scene of any real importance is the first one, and you get a front row seat of the action, while it could have been left up to the imagination. All of the sex scenes are this way, and it's pretty much clear where the directors mind was at. In other cases, he well uses foreshadowing, and delivers small pieces of the story and plot that are missed by some naysayers; but I can understand this, because the sex scenes can easily put many viewers off to the point where they can care less about what is actually going on.

 Kite does pretty well in the style department. The animation is pretty good and the action scenes will deliver to most gore hounds. They are very graphic and brutal, with blades that resemble icepicks, being used to impale hands and feet during battles. The shoot outs concerning the exploding ammo is almost reminiscent of Fist of the Northstar. The sex scenes are indeed XXX. You pretty much get the whole nine yards here; cowgirl position, doggy-style, and full penetrations. This is pretty much a porno here.

 The anime is quite noir-ish with good attention to detail to city landscapes, and I really liked the use of lighting. The darker sets gave a good ambiance that captures the moody feel of the movie. This also goes for the somewhat lack of lighting in certain daytime segments.

 The soundtrack consists of jazzy tunes that features light piano and saxophone laden backgrounds. At times, the songs fit pretty well, while during others it feels terribly misplaced. The character designs are very good for the most part and they fit with the anime well enough. The only problem that I have in this area, which happens to be a big one, would be the character design of Sawa. Although she appears to be somewhat on the mature side. I found her school girl appearance to clash with the noir-ish setting along with the other characters. Some may feel that this works into the ""cute but deadly"" thing, but I think it has a whole lot more to do with Umetsu's fetish concerning young school girls as well as his very childish mentality.

 I will mention that I hate anime porn. I never understood the fascination with cartoons having sex. I originally picked up Kite because I wanted to see what the hype was about, and I personally believe it's way over-hyped. Now, in the eyes of those who are not familiar with hentai. Kite will appear to contain way too many sex scenes. However, to those whom are very well rounded in anime, I will mention to them that this has nothing on Legend of the Overfiend.

 Personally, I look at this type of anime differently from the way I use to, so I won't overlook the story if it's there. Kite has a little bit going for it, but unless you're very action starved, a die hard anime fan, or love hentai, then I recommend skipping it. If you enjoyed Mezzo Forte then you'll probably like this.

 Highs: Action, some kind of character development, maintains serious focus

 Lows: Sex scenes add almost nothing, somewhat clashing of style",1446681600,3,5143,4.565689467969598

8031956,4,B0002UB2YG,"This is the actual uncut version that was released on DVD (cover of Sawa jumping off a building). It contains the underaged sex scenes with Sawa and I haven't found anything cut. I decided to write that very direct, because people who're trying to add an uncensored version of Kite to their collection have to deal with tons of guess work and varying cuts of the film. Kite has been released many times in ""uncut"" formats only to still have edits. Rest assured, this is an actual uncut version of Kite.

However, there's segments of the film that take a real drop in quality. One moment you're watching a Bluray, the next, you're watching a laser disc or vcd back in 1994. It's barely DVD quality. And coincidentally enough, those quality dips are around/during the sex scenes. Which are already sparse enough. So they're much more jarring and noticable, because your brain doesn't get a moment to grow accustomed to it before it's gone. It's just, bam! Welcome to 1994-- bam, you're back! ""What just happened?!! why is my nose bleeding. Which one of y'all kicked me?"" status.

Extras are junk imo. The making is the same one that was released years ago, same quality as the dvd too. It's nice to have, but if you've seen it or own it already, there's no added value here.

if you want a 98% Blu Ray upscale of an Uncut Kite, this is it! Other than that, great movie and I like the cover. Time for Mezzo Forte to have an uncut re-release.",1515196800,9,1438,4.501915708812261

8031958,4,B0002UB2YG,"KITE was originally released in the late 90's and has always been a bit of an odd title in that there are so many cuts of it.

The most commonly (and only available blu-ray until now) has been a 47-minute cut which brings it to a 16+ rating, this newly released 51-minute version which brings it to an 18+ rating and an international uncut version which is not available in the US (due to one scene).

The Blu-Ray comes on a BD-25 and is indeed the ""uncut"" version (the 51-minute version). The movie is presented in 1.33:1 (the oldschool ""fullscreen"") meaning that there are black bars on the left and right on a widescreen TV. Audio is in both English and Japanese (with subtitles). There are 4 tracks total, I believe a PCM and a Surround track for both languages.

Extras are very minimal (2 older video interviews in standard definition)

Where there is a bit of an issue, and according to the disclaimer at the start it is the only footage available, are that they had to splice in very low quality footage at parts (something that appears to be possibly a VHS clip). The majority of the movie looks great but some scenes do switch to this VHS footage. This is usually for a small amount of time, but still noteworthy.",1511395200,16,1223,4.4708520179372195
