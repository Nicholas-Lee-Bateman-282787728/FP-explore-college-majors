4288287,5,B0049EVR1O,"I watched this special family Christmas film in San Francisco with my girlfriend, and we simply loved it.  Heart warming and full of magic, it has that special quality of inspired comic genius and fun you rarely see these days.

The kids are hilarious, laugh out loud funny. Their acting and singing were touching; the whole film reminds one of the first time you watch a child in the Christmas Nativity play, so innocent, so sweet, it may even bring a few tears flowing down along with the constant laughter.

Destined to be a Christmas favorite in our house every year.  5 stars without a doubt.",1289952000,11,597,4.60377358490566
4288288,5,B0049EVR1O,"I had the opportunity to preview this film as part of the Heartland Film Festival in Indianapolis, IN. I never laughed so much and yet felt tears of joy well up in my eyes at the same time as I watched this film.  While this British film focuses on the traditional school Christmas program or pageant, you do not need to be Christian to enjoy this story of children finding their place in the world and the joy that comes from sharing one's talent and working as a team. Cynics beware; you too may find yourself succumbing to laughter and tears in spite of yourself.",1289606400,9,566,4.390476190476191

The facial expressions the characters do are hilarious, the comedy is beyond brilliant, the story-line couldn't be more original, and the music...so catchy and fun! This is my go to movie when I'm feeling down, because it never fails to fall out of my chair laughing! If you buy it, I certainly hope you get more joy out of it than I have.",1498176000,,425,4.325

4288521,5,B0049EVR1O,"The movie is slow at the beginning and picks up,  but the performance the kids put on makes this worth more than 5 stars. I would like to see a full version of that performance.

4288571,5,B0049EVR1O,"This movie is just too funny.  Martin Freeman is amazing as the downtrodden everyman elementary school teacher, Paul Maddens, whose life is a disappointing bore until he chances to tell a little lie that sets in motion a series of events that escalate to turn his life (and the lives of everyone in the community) upside down.

The supporting cast is equally fabulous:  Pam Ferris (Mrs. Bevan, the Principal), Jason Watkins (Gordon Shakespeare, the snooty, competitive rival of Mr. Maddens), and Marc Wooten (the hilarious nitwit Mr. Poppy) are delightful.  The child actors in the film (especially Ben Wilby as Bob) are so naturally hilarious that they steal every scene in which they appear.

Writer/Director Debby Islit (the writer/director) and her husband Nick Ager wrote the delightful songs for this movie.

This is a great movie for the whole family.",1433980800,,858,5.0928571428571425

I read another review on here saying it was inapprorpiate during the actual play scene and- I watched it and there was nothing that stood out as inappropriate, to me.

All in all I thought the whole show was a great, funny movie and it was adorable!
All the kids are super cute, as is Mr. Poppy and hey- Martin Freeman is adorable, too.

4288654,5,B0049EVR1O,"We never heard of this movie, I was searching amazon prime and happened upon it. My kids (11 and 15) loved it! Both my husband I loved it! It's different as to the  cinematography and some of the acting was left unpolished intentionally, that is the magnificent part of the beauty of this film. Bilbo teaches kindergarten, was my daughter's comment. My favorite character was Mr. Piper, he is the British equivalent of America's Jack Black. There are a few cheeky parts, but nothing these over-protective parents had to explain or justify.
If you don't enjoy this movie your heart is made of stone and you probably spend too much time with electronic devices. 
You will enjoy the twist on the age old Nativity story. This is fresh, it will make you laugh out loud, make you cry silently, and cheer at the end. Without spoiling too much, I can't wait until you meet Bob! The only one star review claimed of sexual gestures and swearing, but the boy was imitating Michael Jackson and emulated an innocent version of the crotch grab. The swearing, they called the donkey an a$$. All was extremely innocent compared to what children see driving through town.

My boys (ages 13 and 16) already liked Martin Freeman (from Sherlock) so they were up for watching this.  We loved this movie--the children are hilarious but it's even more funny because they are behaving like real children, not like child actors.  Martin Freeman is, of course, adorable, but his side kick (""Poppy"") steals the show.  We loved that they showed nearly all of the nativity play (that the children had been rehearsing for) at the end of the movie.",1419984000,,552,4.65979381443299
4288656,3,B0049EVR1O,"I would have given this 5 stars because we laughed through most of the movie, but the last play finale ruined it for my whole family.

4288657,4,B0049EVR1O,This was such a cute movie. I was born in the UK but mostly raised in the US. We were raised with lots of trips back to the UK so I am very familiar with the humor and style of the Brits. It's a cute little family film that everyone can enjoy. Don't miss Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger either!,1419897600,,295,3.8524590163934427
4288658,4,B0049EVR1O,"Let's get the caveats out of the way: Debbie Isitt's screenplay does contain certain implausibilities - two children miss school and jet off to Los Angeles with their teacher Mr. Maddens (Martin Freeman); while Maddens himself, together with his teaching assistant Poppy (Marc Wootton) stage their Nativity Play in the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, complete with strobe lights, visual effects and lighting that is more characteristic of a Lloyd Webber musical than a school play.  At one point the fuses blow; and the children continue to perform by candlelight.  The sheer strength of the lighting suggests that they have also been given divine intervention so as to let the performance continue.

Nonetheless, NATIVITY! is a really enjoyable piece of work; the kind of feel-good movie that makes you believe in human goodness, at least for a brief period.  Freeman's Maddens is a carefully observed study in insecurity - a primary school teacher desperately trying to convince everyone that he has got over a lengthy love-affair with Jennifer Lore (Ashley Jensen(, but making a very poor job of it.  His depression manifests itself in the way he treats his students - although fond of them, he finds it incredibly difficult to relate to them.  This is where Poppy proves such a cathartic figure; through a combination of enthusiasm and sheer brute force he convinces Maddens to engage more fully in directing the play and to become more personally responsible for his students' welfare.  There is one particularly moving sequence where Madden reads the letters written by his students to Santa Claus, and discovers that they know everything about his failed love-affair.  Wiping the tears from his eyes, Madden exits stage left and resolves to produce as good a piece of work as he can.

NATIVITY! contains its fair share of memorable cameos, from Alan Carr as a poison-pen critic with a fondness for eating during the performance, to Jason Watkins as a rival teacher in a private school determined to ensure that Maddens' production does not receive as favorable a critical opinion as his own.

The message here is a simple one - in a class-ridden society such as Britain, it's not always the privileged children who prove most successful.  Even those from less wealthy backgrounds, who have perhaps been dismissed as ""useless"" or incompetent, can be encouraged to produce something worthwhile, if only they are given the self-confidence to do so.  The credits end with a dedication to ""all inspirational teachers"" in the audience, at whatever educational level.  NATIVITY! proves what can be done if they are given the chance to inspire.",1419724800,,2640,5.083333333333333

It comes out every year in December and invariably has us all laughing and crying at this heart-warming depiction of a primary school production of a nativity play. With wonderful performances by the children, there is a fantastic christmas story of star-crossed lovers underpinning the school story, and some great supporting roles.

I cannot recommend this film highly enough. If your kids are in a Nativity play this christmas - this is a must see film!",1407110400,,906,7.872549019607843

4288748,3,B0049EVR1O,"Maybe my expectations were too high. This is a nice little Xmas movie, but not great. It's not one that I'll look forward to every year and I was rather expecting it would be. Still, if you just want a Xmas movie, this is fine.",1395187200,,227,4.066666666666666

4288788,4,B0049EVR1O,"This movie is about a school competition for nativity plays. It introduces us to the school and bumbling teaching assistant, principal and the children in the class whose talents are used to put on the nativity play. You will see these same kids in the sequel: Danger in the Manger; Nativity 2.
Keep in mind this is not to be authentic, but loose interpretations of the nativity. Some more devout people may find it a bit offensive. Remember it isn't a reverent movie, it is meant to be fun, family entertainment and on that is delivers. We see some talented and not so talented kids and lots of competition. All in all, I will watch it again come next Christmas. The story line of the adults in the movie is not that interesting, the kids carry the movie along with the teacher and assistant teacher and how their relationship goes from almost hate to mutual respect.",1389052800,,868,4.57051282051282
4288819,5,B0049EVR1O,"Fun.  So much fun.  Also, a bit ridiculous but it's a Christmas film and that is what Christmas films tend to be.  If one is looking for a film that is upbeat, hopeful, filled with Christmas Spirit (and I believe that this is a very real thing), and can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age then I would suggest adding this and the sequel into the Christmas films rotation as it certainly deserves to be there.",1389052800,,412,4.324675324675325

4288828,5,B0049EVR1O,"I don't generally like cutesy Christmas movies - they're either so syrupy it makes me ill, or they're just stupid. This is neither. The heart in this film is a sublime blend of insanity and emotion. The music is wonderful and the kids delightfully NORMAL (as not one of them is a professional actor, but each a child who voluntarily gave up their summer holidays to make a film). Mr. Freeman is absolutely stellar, and Mr. Wooton is at just the right touch of chaos. A perfect, rewatchable time and time again, Christmas movie.",1387497600,,527,4.617021276595745

So I bought the disc and my family and the school age kids I played it for love it.  It's British with some well known character actors.  However, the real stars are the kids.  The musical play at the end is funny but heartwarming, a bit irreverent but not over the line.

4288921,5,B0049EVR1O,"The reception was great but for some reason I could not rewind which is important with such a great movie.  Amazon subscription is fantastic because you can pay for a movie you want but you don't have to ever rent because of all the great FREE movies - SO GREAT!  But in this case renting the movie was the best movie decision I probably have ever made.  I am a believer in the Bible so for me this was a slam dunk.  The movie did not shove any religion including Catholic down your throat.  It just told the story of the nativity in the most delicately sweet manner with wonderful songs with actual tunes you end up humming the next day.  The children were beyond adorable and all excellent little actors and Martin Freeman and all the cast including one of my absolute favorites, Pam Ferris, were stellar in their very English subtle performances.  Can't say enough about the innocence and brilliance of the character of Mr. Poppy.  I was touched, inspired, and oddly left the experience with new hope for my own life.

It has all the elements you want in a funny, upbeat, pull-your-heart-just-a-smidge, holiday movie.  Martin Freeman is wonderful as Mr. Maddens, both inspiring to and inspired by the children.  And the children themselves have so much personality, you can't help but root for them all as they put together their show. The songs are fun and catchy, and we were all humming them for weeks.  So as this past Christmas approached I knew this movie needed to be part of our Christmas celebrations, and we watched it over and over!
Even now in late spring I catch myself using one-liner's from the movie... it's one that just sticks with you, and makes me smile.",1368403200,,742,4.598484848484849
4288926,5,B0049EVR1O,This is a very enjoyable Christmas movie and as a plus stars the very appealing Martin Freeman - as a very serious school teacher whose life is turned upside down when he is assigned a helper - a childlike oaf who needs a lot more watching than the children. There is some rivalry between the school and another more wealthy school over the yearly Christmas production and they end up putting on a Hollywood production of a Nativity play. The story includes a cast of cute and hilarious kids. The music is so good that you won't be able to get the songs out of your head for awhile.,1367107200,,582,4.348623853211009

This movie has made itself one of our favorite Christmas movies ever. We watch it numerous times during the holiday season. I was channel surfing one day last year and on BBC, they were showing ""Nativity"" and it was listed as a comedy. I had to look and the next thing I know, I get caught up in this amazing movie and ordered it immediately, If you are looking for an off the wall, feel good Christmas movie, this is it.

4289005,5,B0049EVR1O,"I stumbled upon this movie on Netflix and decided to give it a try because I like Martin Freeman. Little did I know that by the time it was over I would be captivated. When the contract ran out on Netflix I wanted to watch it again so badly that I bought it and I'm not sorry. Without giving away too much of the plot the story is basically an underdog type movie. The children are told to do a Nativity play for their school, a school not known for its excellence, shall we say, and Freeman's character is the teacher in charge. Enter Mr. Poppy, a child seemingly stuck in a man's body hilariously played by Marc Wooton. There is a romantic back story which added to the plot but didn't distract from the thrust of the story.

  One of the things that amazes me about this move and it's sequel, Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger (that I have yet to see) is that they are all improve. That's right. No script! Yet the children as well as the seasoned adult actors do so well that I never knew it until out of curiosity I researched it. This has quickly become a Christmas favorite and everyone I've shared it with has loved it. I now eagerly anticipate it's sequel which has not dropped below the #5 spot in the UK since it's release, falling just behind the new James Bond movie, Skyfall, and taking the #2 spot behind The Hobbit, also starring Martin Freeman. (Why neither of the Nativity! movies were released in the US is no mystery, Hollywood is interested in blockbusters over quality) Nativity! is the little movie that could, and when I watched it I understood why it did so well in the UK.",1356652800,3,1597,4.334448160535117

4289073,5,B0049EVR1O,"I caught the last ten minutes of this on TV one morning last December as I was wrapping presents and thought it looked interesting. As a former music teacher and wife of a minister who has had her share of producing Nativity programs I LOVED this movie.  It is so funny yet with kind spirit.  It's also very silly at times but I LOVE silly.  I bought the DVD, showed it to another teacher friend who then bought it for her daughter who is also a music teacher.  And then I sent a copy to my son for his birthday.

I even showed to to one certified grinch who couldn't keep from laughing.

It's not for really young kids, in some parts, tho, but nothing any upper elementary student hasn't heard.  It's a gem of a movie.",1348272000,2,719,4.204379562043796

4289075,3,B0049EVR1O,"This film readies you for more than it delivers. The concept, the humor, the relationships all point to greatness, but the ending is lacking. An opportunity for a meaningful nativity play was trumped by a flashy performance. Nevertheless, the ending did energize & uplift.
One caution: the film repeatedly includes off-color dance moves performed (mostly) by children.",1332979200,5,368,5.473684210526316
4289076,4,B0049EVR1O,This was a refreshing Christmas DVD. It has humour and romance as well as a very good and original nativity play. I highly recommend it.,1327276800,2,136,4.48

4289099,5,B0049EVR1O,"Without ever having heard of this movie before, I decided to watch it (airing on Showtime) while wrapping Christmas presents.  I typically multi-task with the TV as my background noise but with this movie, I found myself so hooked that I stopped all my tasks and focused only on the film. It was funny and heart-warming, without the sticky sweet schmaltz and the songs were very catchy.  In a television landscape of commercialism, I found this little gem to be such a treat.  I will definitely buy this movie and make this part of my holiday ritual every year.",1324771200,3,561,4.646464646464646
4289100,5,B0049EVR1O,"My husband and I watched this from Showtime on a whim and we loved it!  We both laughed out loud at the endearing children who are talented, cute and funny.  I really liked the normalcy to the lyrics of the songs (Joseph and Mary as a boy meets girl tune and Nazareth as a wonderful city) to say nothing of the music itself.  I can't wait to share this movie with my sister who loves BBC productions and my adult daughter who I know will laugh as loud as I did at these brilliant children actors!  I am buying it today to have in my collection of Christmas classics!",1324598400,2,566,4.165137614678899
4289101,3,B0049EVR1O,"This is a delightful movie for the entire family. The plot is nothing new. Paul is a teacher who never seems to measure up to his old friend when it comes to their school's nativity programs. One day Paul sprouts off to his competitive ex-friend that a mutual friend of theirs and Paul's ex (Jennifer), who has made it big in Hollywood (or has she?) is going to make Paul's nativity into a gigantic Hollywood production.

Thanks to Paul's clumsy but hilarious teacher's aide (Desmond) the entire town quickly finds out about this lie and are thrilled. Soon Paul is getting all the attention he ever hoped for though he might not want it. Hollywood fuels his class' enthusiasm and Paul can't bear to let them down by telling the truth. Before long Paul's lie becomes so outrageous he goes to desperate lengths to make the Hollywood farce become true. It might not work out the way Paul planned it but it all works out in the end.

Desmond and the kids were a delight. It's funny seeing Paul lie and scramble around desperately to make things right. The best part was the kids' nativity play at the end.

Very cute, funny and entertaining film for the entire family.",1324598400,4,1164,4.559808612440191

4289105,3,B0049EVR1O,"This is a very good movie which starts off a bit questionably (primarily with the obvious comic relief character, the teacher's aid) but really develops into an enjoyable movie.  I've given this movie a solid three star rating because it is not a perfect five star movie.  The elaborate show at the end is fantastic but unrealistic given a school's resources and the characters don't have great development except for the lead.  But these are minor nitpicks in what was an extremely enjoyable movie.  Definitely recommended.  I do wish there was more than a Spanish subtitle (there's a cute blonde boy (who looks like a young Simon Pegg)) who just cracks me up but with the English accent, is hard to follow.  There's also no extras beyond a trailer for the movie.  But if you think a delightful English Christmas movie is right up your alley, then definitely check out this movie.  I bought my DVD sight unseen and I'm very happy for doing so.",1323648000,4,944,4.678787878787879

This ended up being the funniest movie I've seen in a while. The characters from Mr. Poppy to the children are extremely hilarious. The ending was sweet and watching the children sing I had a good time watching this. This is probably the 1st British film I've seen that I can recall. This is now my favorite Christmas movie. I only wish this movie was available on Blu-Ray.

4289135,5,B0049EVR1O,"This is best Christmas story I've seen in years. Only the feel-good ending was entirely predictable. All along the way there were small twists and turns that kept surprising me.

The story begins when elementary school teacher, Paul Maddens - who has a reason to be severely depressed by Christmas - is railroaded into directing the Nativity pageant by his school's Headmistress. The pageant is clearly destined for failure. That is, until a bizarre character named Mr. Poppy shows up as Mr. Maddens' new teacher's assistant. Poppy (who is actually the Headmistress' in-need-of-a-job nephew) serves as the catalyst for both the complications and the magic needed to turn the depressed school teacher's hopeless situation around.

Martin Freeman's sincere and perfectly understated performance as the disheartened Paul Madden was great. And (I'm not sure how he did it) some how Marc Wooten managed to make the ridiculous character, Mr. Poppy, not only believable, but endearing. Add to this a classroom full of totally charming children and the result is a sparkling, fun Christmas tale.",1292112000,8,1087,5.277456647398844
4289136,5,B0049EVR1O,"I actually saw this a week after Christmas and immediately wanted to watch it again the next day! For that reason I can't wait for this to be released.
There are not many British Christmas films but this is the best I've seen. Even better than Love, Actually.
The characters are so warm you'll forgive any situations that seem implausible. The children are not your usual stage-school kids and that is the key to the film's success. They are totally natural and lovable!
Martin Freeman plays his usual persona and very good he is too. Standouts for me were Pam Ferris and Ashley Jensen. Initially I wasn't sure about the character of teaching assistant Mr Poppy but his child-like enthusiasm won me over. Alan Carr was brilliant too! Only downside to the whole film for me was Ricky Tomlinson as the mayor.

I'm going to buy this and save it to watch on Christmas Eve. This would make a great Christmas present for those that like laughing!",1290384000,18,940,4.62874251497006
