8048478,5,B0007LXONM,"I recommend buying from this seller.
I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.
Although this is not in the original manga, I always wondered what goku did in otherworld. (go ssj3!!)",1392940800,,394,4.486111111111111
8048479,5,B0007LXONM,"I really enjoy seeing the adventures of Goku but I more so enjoy seeing Gohan's battles.
Pikon and Goku batter in a martial arts tournament and it is a battle for the ages.
To be the best, Goku should have fought Gohan.
This is a great movie but the imagination always wants more.

8048480,5,B0007LXONM,"first off i wanna say that i love filler, and if your missing out on some awesome episodes like these because you hate filler, than you need to have your head examined. honestly, who gives a damn if this wasent in the pages of Akiras original work? youll find filler in just about any anime these days, so you better get used to it. so about the dvd, it has the much anticipated fight between Goku and Pihkan, and the fight between those two did not dissapoint. i strongly reccomend this dvd, especcially if you like to see a great fight",1201132800,,537,4.326732673267327

8048482,5,B0007LXONM,"The tournament in the aftelife is near a close, with only two fighters left: Goku and the green-skinned Pikkon(Kyle Hebert/Hikaru Midorikawa).  Goku's in for quite a tough time!  After all, Pikkon was able to take Cell down in one blow!  Does the fighter even stand a chance?  To win, Goku will need to keep all his speed, strength, and wits together!  Despite the fact that this is a 5-part filler arc, the battle between the two dead combatants itself is well-done, with faced paced animation that really shakes things up.  The end of the second episode also shows Gohan all grown up!  The final episode is also quite fun, as the teenaged Gohan has his first day in high school, and has to do his best to blend in with the crowd(of course, having half-saiyajin genes doesn't make things easy!), especially when his classmate/daughter of Mr. Satan, Videl Satan(in her first appearance) starts to become suspicious.  This in turn leads into quite a few hilarious incidents.  The episode is also the 1st to feature the new opening and closing themes, ""We Gotta Power,"" and ""We Were Angels.""  The dubbing is a bit better(though of course the English SCRIPTS are another matter), and Kyle Hebert, who takes over the role in the US version as Gohan's adult voice, actually does a pretty good job.  Kara Edwards joins the dub cast as Videl(Goten doesn't show up until the next episode, which is the next volume), and she's OK, but I do have to say she's no Yuko Minaguchi.  This is a pretty good DBZ volume, one I really suggest fans should pick it up.  It's the start of a new era for DBZ, one that's going to be a blast.",1114473600,2,1617,4.572916666666667
