8683198,2,6301872029,"If you really want to see volleyball, don't buy this video.  We bought this video expecting to see complete footage of some of the best volleyball games played in Seoul in 1988, hoping it would show at least as much as was televised that year.  To our great disappointment, this video is basically just a highlights video with some extra fluff thrown in.  The only volleyball you see is the last 60 seconds or so of all the major games played.  All told, you get maybe 20 minutes of volleyball.  Definitely not worth the selling price of the video!",1135814400,4,548,4.494949494949495
