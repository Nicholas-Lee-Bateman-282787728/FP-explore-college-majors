8546574,4,B00A3YMU56,"I had not seen Tom Mix before, and this movie is a pretty good place to start.  There are no close-ups, probably because film-making was still in its relative infancy in 1913 and would develop more in the decade to come.  From what I understand this was a feature film in the late 'teens made up of footage from earlier two-reelers and the seams show.  Mix did his own stunts and he got pretty beat up in this one, many bad things happening to him.  Still a happy ending, and the intertitles make it easier to follow the story.  The music is period orchestrations, happy jazz at first, then appropriately themed 'excitement' music, but not a custom-made score that follows the action as some other silent film productions have done.  Print quality is watchable throughout, and I am thankful to Alpha for making this Tom Mix film available to us.",1359849600,,845,4.6
