4335928,4,B004E4NFTQ,"I think your TVs' may have zoomed you. Instead of 1080p try watching this in 480p to catch scenes that were skipped or shorted. In fact, try watching a lot of movies firstly in 480p. Psych 9 has all the elements that make for a good movie: cohesion,
character development, a dark threatening atmosphere, credible acting. It isn't a great movie but the opening certainly grabs attention. The psychiatist is a ghost killing blond women. The lead character becomes his unwitting patient. The detective suspects her.",1307318400,2,512,4.965116279069767
4335929,2,B004E4NFTQ,"Your husband drives a taxi at night. You take a job sorting records at a closed hospital at night. There might be a couple of ghosts running around the building, and you are losing chunks of time. And, there is a serial killer running around town, and his schedule synchs with your blackouts and your husband's schedule. Could it get any stranger? Yes, it could.

In Psych9, Roslyn (Sara Foster - D.E.B.S.) takes a job working nights at a closing hospital, because her husband Cole (Gabriel Mann - Mad Men) drives a late shift taxi, and they wanted to be on the same schedule. While working Roslyn meets and begins talking to a Dr. Irvin Clement (Cary Elwes - The Princess Bride), who begins dredging up old feelings and putting ideas in her head. Also making his presence known is Det. Marling (Michael Biehn - The Terminator) who seems to believe that Roslyn knows something about the brutal murders that are occurring in that area of town. Cue horrific youthful memories, secrets, ghosts, and the husband's work schedule with all the unaccounted for times. Factor in the misplaced trusts, distrust and delusions and you have the makings of a good psychological thriller.

Unfortunately this isn't a good psychological thriller. I can overlook flaws if the story flows well and I don't have the time or inclination to find fault. Paych9 doesn't fit the bill. Roslyn takes a job to be with Cole, but they do nothing but kvetch and fight. This could have gone the Amityville Horror route, and had the haunted hospital cause a rift in their marriage, but their problems predate the opening credits. Couple this with uneven pacing, and a plot line with too many elements, and you have a well intentioned, but weak thriller.

Psych9 tried to take a story of torment and haunting, but mistook confusion for plot twists. You have Roslyn's marriage problems, a serial killer, ghosts (?), and childhood memories of abuse. The acting was good, and the central European architecture and ambiance gave the movie a setting that scores high on the creep factor rating. But all that can't save this film. If they had only focused on one plotline and a red herring this would have been an `A' movie. But they didn't, and it isn't, so this movie may be for you, but it's not for me.",1300665600,,2537,4.730769230769231
4335930,3,B004E4NFTQ,"Cary Elwes (SAW) and Michael Biehn (ALIENS) star in this somber, sluggish and incoherent thriller.
Sara Foster is the focus of the movie, an edgy filing clerk with a dark past.  Foster is a capable actress, but lacks the maturity to pull it off.  The serial killer plot is intriguing, but never truly resolves itself, unless you contrive one for yourself.
Lots of red herrings don't help either and the motives behind Foster's behavior don't make a lot of sense.
Potential is there but poorly executed.  Conditionally recommended.",1299283200,,530,5.0
4335931,1,B004E4NFTQ,"Psych 9 is beyond merely bad, it is holy crap bad as it runs the gamut from clich (nut-job jerkily smoking a cigarette while spilling his/her guts about something that rattled their cage in the past)  to non sequitur plot devices (suddenly appearing/disappearing former residents of the closed down hospital).  The lead character, Rosalyn, inexplicably gets (and maintains!) a job of organizing old case files.  I say `inexplicable' because she still somehow has that job after the fourth or fifth meltdown--and somehow never once gets busted for those tape recorder sessions.  It honestly never occurs to any of the real characters that she is a prize-winning whack-a-roo!  Speaking of Roslyn, if takes real talent to portray a massively abused character with such dispassion that you end of completely not giving a crap about any of her trauma---but leave it to Sara Foster to pull this one off.  The implications of her portrayal are pretty dire too:  this film seems to imply that it is ok for a husband (in this point, Roslyn's boneheaded one) to pressure his wife for sex to the point of being just short of spousal abuse as long as he has been long suffering (in his eyes, anyway), asked nicely and hasn't verbally dumped on her too recently.  Sadly, the two big names, Cary Elwes and Michael Behn, never seem to rise to each's fullest respective potential.  Behn's character might as well have never been written in the film-heck, he doesn't even catch the Nighthawk killer.  In fact, we are never quite sure how that gets resolved.  Though implied, I much prefer to be hammered over the head with those kind of resolutions.  Speaking of resolutions, the Psych 9's resolution will probably leave you shaking your head and wondering at the futility of a life that sees you wasting 1:39 minutes to watch this septic tank fest of crap.",1299283200,7,1840,4.843450479233227
4335932,2,B004E4NFTQ,"This year's edition of the Ghost House Underground flicks is only a pair of horror dirges: the fairly average Stag Night, and this psychological thriller Psych:9.  The story revolves around a young woman (Sara Foster) with a very troubled past who takes a job getting archived files in order at a recently closed down hospital.  Before you can say ""boo"", she starts experiencing some strange phenomena that may be linked to a series of brutal serial killings happening in the neighborhood.  Her few contacts consist of the doctor on the psych floor (Cary Elwes), her distant husband (Gabriel Mann), and a detective (Michael Biehn); all of whom perform decently enough, but in the end, the film is just a tiresome bore.  It is very slow moving, and it takes quite some time for it to pick up any speed.  Not to mention the fact that the confusing, plot hole-laden story with red herrings aplenty and some just plain bad dialogue makes things all the worse to boot.  By the time that Psych:9 reaches its climax, you'll be wondering just what the point of it all was.  All in all, you'll certainly see worse films of this type, but Psych:9 is better left ignored all things considered.",1299196800,8,1182,4.70873786407767
4335933,1,B004E4NFTQ,"This movie jumped around so much I kept asking myself if I had missed something. But no, it's just very convoluted, and nothing ends up happening anyway. About halfway through, I gave up on watching it because nothing happens, and started ffwing through it. Waiting, waiting, waiting, then it was over. No point!",1299024000,8,312,4.90566037735849
4335934,2,B004E4NFTQ,"A woman working the night shift in a hospital that has been closed begins to witness things that may be connected to a serial killer.  After talking with a psychiatrist (Elwes) that still works in the hospital Roslyn (Foster) begins to see things differently.  This movie is hard to explain and review.  One because it jumps around between daydreams, flashbacks and the normal movie scenes that its hard to keep track where you are, and two because it's kinda boring I wasn't focused on it the entire time.  This movie was a little like the ""Last Exorcism"" in the way that it seemed like every few minutes the plot and idea switched back and forth.  There were so many ideas that could have gone somewhere cool if they let it.  Even though this is another ""Ghosthouse"" movie it was more psychological then scary.  I really don't feel one way or the other about it, not much of an impact.  I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - No, barely made it through once.",1298073600,6,960,4.44

I have really been enjoying these Ghost House Underground films that Raimi and company help get released. So far all of them have been good and this one falls right there with them. The cover for this one was cool when I first picked it up but honestly I would have bought it anyway. This one ended up being pretty good and is one of those average ghost stories that have been coming out lately.

Roslyn just got a new job at a Hospital that is closing down, a file clerk. She takes the job and other than the creepy security guy and the doctor that works upstairs no one is there with her late at night, oh yeah by the way it is a night shift. There has also been a series of murders in the surrounding area by a serial killer called the nighthawk. This brings in a detective who just shows up from time to time and the late night visits from her husband only add to suspension. So as the nights go on Roslyn finds herself more and more afraid of things that go bump in the night.

This was your average creepy flick but like others have said the film doesn't know what it wants to be. At times it feels like a straight serial killer flick and then the ghostly elements just happen. Of course in the end it makes a little more sense but there are things left undone. This is basically a psychological thriller if I had to pick one type of flick. I can see what the writer and director were going for and I can tell that both have the talent to make a really great flick together.

I think the flick was a little to ambitious and the writer and director did not want to cut too much out of the script. For what we get it is a good enough flick with some good acting. Our lead Sara Foster is probably the best here since her character has a lot more to do. Of course we have the always reliable Cary Elwes as the doctor up stairs and Michael Biehn as the detective. Both men do well here but only have so much to work with. Gabriel Mann plays the husband here and ends up getting some good scenes of development for his character, well kinda at one point.

This was far from a classic and had many flaws but like I said it is good enough. If you are a fan of the psychological horror flicks then this might be for you. I found it to be an average horror flick with some good acting and a good storyline that suffered a bit from trying to be too many things. Still this might be for you and would be good for the month of October for obvious reasons.",1380499200,,2457,4.078674948240166
8426467,1,B004E4NFTQ,"Like ""inept editor"", Session 9 is one of my favorite movies and I'm always looking for another creepy story in a psych ward.  I'm still looking.  This movie made little sense from start to finish.  Some spoilers here, or maybe not, since nothing was ever really resolved.  So...the room she keeps going into is 9?  I truly thought it was ""8"" and so kept hoping for the point.  The ""I want my baby""...are we suppose to think that at 10 yrs. old she was pregnant with Daddy's kid?  Is that why Mom attempted to burn little Roz?  What was the good doctor up to; and do we assume a grown-up Roz is the one who ""scalpeled"" him.  Does Roz have blonde hair she dyed brown; or was it always blonde to begin with?  And who the heck is the Nighthawk killer??  What is the point of this movie?  Michael Biehn and Cary Elwes...you guys are much better than this.  Just a confusing, really bad movie.",1379289600,,887,4.303030303030303

8426469,2,B004E4NFTQ,"When I heard about PSYCH:9, the first thing I thought of was one of my all-time favorite psychological thrillers, Brad Anderson's Session 9, and how I was pining away for him to direct the remake of The Crazies a few years ago. The plot-line of a woman filing hospital records in the middle of the night while a serial killer is on the loose outside seemed like a fantastic psychological/gruesome thriller waiting to happen.

Roslyn Hanniger(played by Sara Foster) takes the graveyard shift filing patient records at a closed hospital. With no-one but a creepy security guard, a psychiatrist(played by Cary Elwes) more interested in delving into Roslyn's past than filing his own patient records upstairs, a nosy detective(played by Michael Biehn), and a psychotic killer roaming the streets that the media has dubbed ""The Nighthawk"", Roslyn is determined to survive the killer as well as her own inner demons from her past. Will she survive?

By the end of it, I didn't really care.

The story started off fairly well. It's easy to create a creepy, suspenseful atmosphere in an abandoned hospital, especially one with a psychiatric ward. The development of Roslyn, as we see that her body is burned for reasons unknown until the end, that she has an almost unwilling relationship with her husband, Cole, as well as how her past unfolds during her sessions with Dr. Irvin Clement. Intertwined with this are scene of gore as The Nighthawk continues killing women with blonde hair. The cinematography was also very well done, giving off that shadowy, yet vibrant, vibe that makes good psychological thrillers seem like new-age film noir.

The problem is that, using the idea of ghosts, mental instability, and a serial killer into a whodunit plot, the story seems to lose direction after a while. It's watchable, until the climax, where the ending seems rushed, as if the filmmakers ran out of time, money, or both to write, shoot, and edit a respectable finale. By the climax, you know who the killer is, and rather than delve into that a bit more, we are accosted by the actors doing nothing to finish off the story with some flair.

I give PSYCH:9 2 out of 5 headslams into a wall.",1325116800,,2182,4.823529411764706
8426470,3,B004E4NFTQ,"The main actors in this film do well, and the atmosphere is good and creepy.  Too bad the story isn't more compelling or less confusing.  The ending is especially odd, given the woman's history.",1315958400,,194,4.676470588235294
