5635085,4,B00BJDARA0,"For me being a HUGE Whitesnake fan and own just about everything that Mr. Coverdale has ever released. I was alittle disapointed in this release just because it was (like a lot of you are saying) a half a show. I found out the reason for that was it was taped for TV in Japan. The band could only get so much of the show so that they could release it. I understand this and I will being truely enjoying this release for years to come.

The show itself is amazing the band sounds so great. David sounds amazing, Tishy is a monster and the best drummer the band has ever had. Tommy a VERY close second. And Doug and Reb are so Fin' tight, best guitar tandum the band has EVER had. The 2 standout moments in the show is Forevermore and the best version I've heard of Fool for Your Lovin'.

......Fans don't fret Mr. Coverdale has hinted at a few more great realeases for 2013. THE YEAR OF THE SNAKE 2013!!!!!!!!",1367193600,,908,4.212643678160919
5635086,4,B00BJDARA0,"The show was great, audio and picture were also good,but you will notice the sound track is dubbed over and it does not always match his live voice.",1367193600,9,148,4.321428571428571
5635087,5,B00BJDARA0,"Prior to its release there were several websites that reported that this BD setlist was rather short.  The concert from which it is drawn was actually only a few more songs longer, but since they didn`t owned the rights for these, they sticked to those included.

With this in mind, I already knew that if the concert/audio/video were worthy, this BD will make it to my collection.

As I am mainly a music customer, what I have always found extremely helpful about reading Amazon customer reviews is having the opportunity to inform myself about the quality of a CD , DVD or Blu-ray.

And by quality, I do not mean its price or the length of the material, but the quality of the performance, the audio and the video.  Attributes that if done right, will give me some quality time (albeit short) in my home theater room.

Please spend less time evaluating product value based on price and more on the quality of the product itself.",1366934400,3,930,4.572289156626506
5635088,2,B00BJDARA0,"Not A Good Value...Blu-Ray has only 10 Songs and two of the ten are just crowd sing-along/drum solo! Beware!
  That's right CD-HEAVEN...It sucks...Wassamatta? Can't sell them now that everyone knows? TOO BAD!! I didn't do my homework and didn't wait for others to review this title before purchasing...and I almost regretted it.
  If you look at the great Blu-Ray concert videos out there from Eagles or Rush or Elton John, they use footage from several different performances to make for a long concert experience. Whitesnake has a long list of songs they could have put on here (just like the DVD ""In The Still Of The Night"")
I purchased Live in Japan on an impulse buy at Best Buy. Now I regret purchasing it w/o waiting for the Blu-Ray reviews. After bringing it home, I saw that there was only 10 songs! (10 songs plus two solos, which don't really count).
Here's my dilemma...do I unwrap it and get stuck with it...or do I return it and hope
""In The Still Of The Night"" performance is put on Blu-Ray in the future. ""ITSOTN"" DVD has 15 plus bonus songs plus companion CD's of the live performance...a great value and worthy of a $20 price point should it every come out on Blu-Ray! If you compare the two, the Live in Japan release is not a good value.
 I still love Whitesnake, but I'll wait until another possible release in the future.
***UPDATE***  I returned the unopened Blu-Ray...(glad I didn't open it!)",1366848000,16,1416,4.621513944223108
5635089,2,B00BJDARA0,"I agree with the other reviewers.. this is half a product... and should be half the price.  If I were Coverdale, I would have been embarrased to put this product on the market without filling it up with more content and better quality.",1366848000,9,235,4.465116279069767
5635090,2,B00BJDARA0,"I was very hopeful when I saw this scheduled for release... and a bit less excited when I picked it up at Best Buy today and noted barely a dozen tunes (not counting drum and guitar solos listed as songs).  When you can buy the latest Scorpions set on BR which is a full 2+ hour concert and another nearly half hour of bonus features .....this barely over an hour set with virtually nothing in bonus features seems more suited for a VHS release rather than DVD or .... Blu Ray.  The Whitesnake show on DVD from a few years back&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whitesnake-Live-In-the-Still-of-the-Night-Deluxe-Edition-CD/dp/B000E0OEVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whitesnake Live: In the Still of the Night (Deluxe Edition + CD)</a>&nbsp;has this one beat on just about every count and would have made a great BR entry for Whitesnake.  Another bummer is that the DVD can be purchased with a two CD bonus set up while the BR is bare bones?  Even though it was short and lacking in features I gave in to my desires for some more great Rock video and brought it home today... only to be terribly let down by the actual footage and performance in comparison to the previously noted show.

My suggestion would be to get the 2 CD / DVD set for less money .... I wish I had .. rather than buy this half show blu ray.  Another complaint of mine is when the artist/group leads a sing along during one of their best tunes ... I know they enjoy that but I didn't buy a BR of a Whitesnake concert to hear a Japanese audience singing their finale ... it was however a terrific way for this let down of a disc to end.

I like Coverdale and Whitesnake, but can't give this BR any more than half a full rating of 5 stars as this is half a show and no extras.... sorry.",1366848000,22,1792,4.634069400630914
5635091,2,B00BJDARA0,"I don't know if the the picture quality worth to get it on BD instead of DVD,but regarding the sound quality it clearly doesn't.

Not even any DTS.

This is a fraud.

2 stars because i love Whitesnake.

Since Whitesnake works with Frontiers records,every quality release suck.

P.S.:Sorry,i don't speak english fluently",1366761600,9,319,5.0576923076923075
5635092,5,B00BJDARA0,"Whitesnake made in Japan is an awesome,current example of their powerful rock n roll attitude and soundget this if you are fan of them or any 80s/90s rock genre.",1370995200,,161,4.586206896551724
5635093,5,B00BJDARA0,"Excellent product, the concert is very good, great video and audio quality.  There is also an adequate resolution since it is a blueray disc.",1370822400,,141,4.875
5635094,2,B00BJDARA0,"I was excited to hear the new songs live, I own EVERYTHING Mr Coverdale has ever released and, some bootlegs , The sound quality is great BUT< the band is tuned down a full step from standard tuning, Most non-musicians would not notice this, and as a singer myself understand the purpose , But, it ruins the integrity of  The songs. It makes it sound more like Knickleback, and, that is not a good thing.. I wish I would have not purchased",1370563200,4,439,4.353658536585366
5635095,5,B00BJDARA0,"There has been a lot of trashing this Blu Ray because its only a partial concert. That maybe, but the sound is awesome, and I've seen Whitesnake  live 3 times in the last 3 years and I feel like I'm there in Japan rocking with them. I think they had to cut itshort for the Blu Ray format since Frontiers Records is a small company in Italy. I think the funding was limited. I am bias, I love Whitesnake I always have so anything they do it great to me. I love the Blu Ray.",1369958400,,472,3.968421052631579
5635096,3,B00BJDARA0,"After their amazing DVD, ""In the still of the night"" that they released in around 2005 - 2006, this comes up a little short.  The production quality is still good but not amazing like ""In the still of the night"".  The band has so many great new songs that they don't play.  Whitesnake like so many band's DVD's keeps re-hashing the same old hits; it gets quite boring.  There's only 12 live songs or solo's and only 4 songs from the last 2 albums.  They could of added more, I would of paid more.  The musicians are fantastic as usual but their instruments are so tuned down the songs lose a little bit of pop.  Not terrible, I'd still buy it because I'm a fan.",1369699200,,661,4.24
5635097,5,B00BJDARA0,"Although Whitesnake had their heyday in the 80's, the powerhouse combination of David Coverdale, and guitarist Doug Aldrich prove once again that they are still as relevant as they ever were, if not more. I love this release but prefer ""Live in the Still of The Night"" because of the songs performed.",1369612800,,300,4.788461538461538
5635098,4,B00BJDARA0,This isn't quite as good as the DVD that was filmed in London but it's still worth the bucks if you are a Whitesnake fan.,1368576000,,121,3.88
5635099,3,B00BJDARA0,"Forevermore is an amazing release; they should have given us a few more tunes off it..

sooo..

obviously, why release a bluray w/ barely 10 tunes??? makes zero sense

the audio is way off and gets annoying when your trying to drum to the show!

Brian Tichy is off the hook on drums; worth it just for the drum solo..

they should have released a full 18 song set from the Forevermore tour!

very disappointed....",1367884800,2,413,4.44
5635100,2,B00BJDARA0,"I love Whitesnake and it's a great performance but......the audio is out of sync with the video. For example, you hear the drummer hit his snare slightly before you see him hit it. The audio is dragging behind the video. Very annoying and inexcusable. I've ordered the DVD/CD combo and hope the DVD does not have this flaw. I'll watch (and listen) to that despite the superior picture on the blu-ray.",1367280000,,400,4.647887323943662
