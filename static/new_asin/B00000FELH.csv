7909014,5,B00000FELH,"This was one of the most sensitive and beautiful, yet deeply analyzed, documentaries I have seen - it helped me understand so much of Indian politics, even though I lived there especially through much of the Indira-Rajiv part of it.
  The only thing missing is that this  documentary  ends at the time of Rajiv's assassination, and does not even begin to address the nearly 20 year reign of the Italian-Indian Sonia Gandhi since then...,  which has been very significant  I didn't say great) for India's history.
 Good job PBS!",1318982400,,527,4.853932584269663
7909015,5,B00000FELH,"If you are an intellect, and looking for material worth watching, this is a good one. And if you are from the Indian subcontinent or are familiar with it, this will be thrilling. I watched it in USA and I was impressed with the work the journalists have done to get the interviews and footages which were so precise and well content. Being an American production it has done a good job to cover the topics which were on the other side of the planet. Sign of good research behind it.
It is more of a story of tactics, tragedies, political ambitions, disasters, triumphs, wars (indo-pak) and many other things which has always been a part of Indian politics (The biggest democracy). The story is told very accurately through the first hand interviews of people who were very close to each of the 3 generations of the Nehru-Indira/Gandhi family and a lot of footage not published in press. Very useful to understand what had been going on behind the scenes which have dominated the Indian sub-continent and had been the headliners in the news all around the world in recent times.",1118793600,2,1077,4.643979057591623

7909017,5,B00000FELH,"This 180 minute video set is fascinating from beginning to end. The political saavy of the Nehru/Gandhi clan is amazing and a bit eerie. Why does a family with so much tragedy via assasination(amongst other unnatural  deaths)wish to keep the political power of their forefathers? Amazing  footage abounds and the interviews conducted are well done and highly  imformative. A must for ""history nuts"" and scholars of the worlds  most populous democracy, highly recommended for all.",956448000,3,479,5.346666666666667
