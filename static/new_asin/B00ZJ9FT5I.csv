7283079,5,B00ZJ9FT5I,Transparent watercolor has been my medium of choice for the past 17 years using white gouache for occasional highlights.  Previously I had purchased Mr. Gurney's Watercolor in the Wild and enjoyed it very much.  Since gouache is opaque watercolor I purchased Gouache in the Wild.  It is a wonderful video.  Highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in working in gouache.,1447718400,5,379,5.064516129032258
7283080,5,B00ZJ9FT5I,James Gurney is just so creative! Love this DVD especially since he does several different types of demos using different set ups and materials.  Unlike most art dvd's that do only one painting. This DVD is so well done and a joy to watch!,1442448000,6,239,4.431818181818182

8720390,5,B00ZJ9FT5I,An excellent introduction to using gouache while sketching.  I tried using it for the first time after watching the trailer and looking at Gurney's blog.  Bought the DVD and some gouache and gave it ago.  I like it better than casein which I also tried after buying the casein DVD.  Gurney's method of presentation is friendly and instructive.,1492819200,,343,4.862068965517241
8720391,5,B00ZJ9FT5I,Arrived on time. I was happy to find this DVD since there is not a whole lot of info. on Gouache Painting. James Gurney demonstrated plein-air studies and kept it interesting the whole way through. He gave an in-depth look at Gouache and showed his Plein-Air Painting setup. I would highly recommend this!,1484179200,,305,4.773584905660377
8720392,5,B00ZJ9FT5I,"James does a wonderful job of explaining how he paints with gouache (his technique), his painting philosophy, the way he approaches/chooses his subjects, the equipment he uses, and gouache as a painting medium in general. All of that is great, but what really makes me want to watch it again and again is what he brings to the video with his personality, his choice of locations/subjects, and his spontaneity. It's almost like watching an adventure movie (if you're an artist, that is) and a couple of his locations are almost magical because of his inclusion of the surroundings (people, horses, stories of the location, etc) and his clever use of music and graphics to set a mood for the painting process that is being filmed. The guy is not only an incredibly good artist in most any medium, but he is talented on a bunch of other levels that lend themselves to the filming, scripting, and the technical explanation that he does here. Plus he has a great sense of humor at times with some of the crazy stunts (like the unicycle at the end and the skateboard crash) and seems like a very nice/friendly person. No, I wasn't paid for this review. I really like it that much!",1482364800,,1174,4.62200956937799

8720394,5,B00ZJ9FT5I,"Gouche in the Wild lives up to its title, as it talks about painting in gouache outdoors. To get the most out of the DVD it would help to have some experience of plein air painting and the challenges that it poses. James Gurney helps explode the myth that gouache is not a serious medium, like oils or acrylic. A good addition to any water media painter's library.",1475884800,4,364,4.367647058823529

8720397,5,B00ZJ9FT5I,"Excellent DVD!  James Gurney is very enjoyable to watch!  I really liked the demos on what he carries in his backpack for his art trips and his different set ups and the explanation about the materials he uses.  His Gouache in the Wild  DVD was very well done, and I enjoyed watching it.  obtw - Years ago I purchased a book The Artists guide to Sketching by James Gurney & Thomas Kinkade  where they shared their after college sketching adventures  extremely insightful and a fun read.",1461283200,,486,4.5813953488372094
8720398,3,B00ZJ9FT5I,"I expected more instruction on how to use gouache.  Of the many videos I have covering composition, oil painting, pastels, watercolor, and casein, I was expecting a more thorough demonstration on using gouache.  The video is okay, but I expected something along the lines of Stephen Quiller, where techniques using opaque watercolor are thoroughly discussed and demonstrated.",1454716800,6,375,5.56140350877193
