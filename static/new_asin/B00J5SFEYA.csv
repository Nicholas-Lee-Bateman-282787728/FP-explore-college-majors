8648489,3,B00J5SFEYA,"In 2001 I had a near death experience that I never spoke about because I was afraid of being called a nut. I was cured of the hepatitis c a couple years later and actually had another near death in 2006 where I flatlined.. .. the first was an out of body conversation with an angel. The Spirit body my soul was within was loving, peaceful, tranquil. AWESOME! But the angel made me come back... The second, flatline experience, was in body. As soon as I flatlined I was instantly surrounded by the exact same Jesus Spirit I had experienced in my first near death. I told my first near death testimony while the doctors stared mouths agape at the monitor.. .. so much peace and love. Ironically, their was a full gospel preacher in the room, it all happened so.fast, the room had about 30 people there. As I was slipping away, this preacher anointed me with oil and said, ""In Jesus name come back. In Jesus name come back. In Jesus name come back. "" and here I am... now I speak openly about both experiences. And the things in the Beyond The Grave series is very familiar to me. There is life beyond. In Jesus.",1429920000,2,1109,4.336538461538462
