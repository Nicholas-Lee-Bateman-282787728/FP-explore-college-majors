8517710,4,B007ISFI4K,"This Lockdown delivers pretty well. Open with a good Lethal Lockdown match, has everything you want to see, weapons, violence, and everything in between. The Jeff Hardy/Kurt Angle cage match is great and reminds me of their classic match from No Surrender 2010. And the main event is great. Bobby Roode and James Storm put on great violent matches together and this has one of them. And all of the matches are inside a cage, this Lockdown is overall pretty good.",1404432000,2,462,4.716049382716049

8517713,3,B007ISFI4K,"The Lethal Lockdown match between Team Eric and Team Garrett was a entertaining but forgettable affair. The Tag Team title match between The Motor City Machine Guns against the team of Magnus & Samoa Joe was mediocre at best. The TV title match between Robbie E & Devon was short but sweet. The Women's title match between Velvet Sky & Gail Kim was a dud. The Crimson-Matt Morgan match was not great but pretty good. The Kurt Angle-Jeff Hardy match was not great but better then the other bout before this. The Women's tag team title match between the team of Rosita & Sarita against the team of ODB & Eric Young was also a dud. The Worlds title match between Bobby Roode & James Storm was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth brawl even with the dumb ending. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1353715200,,780,4.423611111111111
8517714,2,B007ISFI4K,"It should be noted that all the matches on this PPV could be won by pinfall/submission or climbing out of the cage (except Lethal LockDown since there is no escape) & TNA started filming the entrances from a new angle which was very MMA inspired.

Lethal LockDown Match - Team Garett vs. Team Eric: Garett Bischoff, A.J. Styles, Mr. Anderson, Austin Aries, Rob Van Dam vs. Eric Bischoff, Christopher Daniels, Kazarian, Bully Ray, Gunner - For those who haven't seen a Lethal LockDown match, it's held under the same rules of the old WCW/NWA match of War Games. One man from each team starts the match and after a 3 minute period, another member from one team (which has always been the heel team for those trivia buffs) enters and after each one minute time period, the teams alternate sending members in. Once all team members enter the cage, the roof containing all the weapons is lowered onto the cage and the only way to win is by pinfall or submission.
This was the first time Lethal LockDown began the annual PPV event with the special stipulations for this match being that the losing captain must leave TNA with the additional clause on Eric being that he can't use the Bischoff name if he loses as well. Despite being the captain, Garett demanded that he entered the match first for his team which pretty much set the story of this match with Garett taking a beating from everyone including moments where his dad Eric eventually just held him for the team members to get a shot in only for Eric to hide in the corner whenever Garett's team started to gain an advantage. While this LockDown was full of the usual use of various weapons and a few spots like the cage door being slammed on Kaz's head & RVD being darted straight into the cage, it was pretty uneventful as it was lack a moment of suspense or a huge memorable spot as this match pretty much just revolved about Garett proving how tough he was by taking a beating from start to finish to the point where it seemed like the match completely stopped just so Eric & Garett can have their moment in the end. This was without a doubt the most uneventful Lethal LockDown that I can remember.

Tag Team Champions Samoa Joe & Magnus vs. Motor City Machine Guns - The match didn't start off well for the Guns as their theme music came on late when they were already at ringside while this was the PPV return of Chris Sabin since his injury close to a year earlier. The champions singled out Sabin & focused on him with power moves like slams & suplexes including one fall away slam that knocked the Guns into each other while Guns used their speed & high flying to their advantage with moves like the double stomp off the top rope & Slice Bread #2. This was a back & forth match but always seemed to keep the same pace & never really picked up but more relevant as the last performance of the Motor City Machine Guns in TNA as Alex Shelley left a short time later.

Television Champion Devon vs. Robbie E - This was really just short & sweet as Robbie was in control until one mishap allowed Devon to gain control for the win.

Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Velvet Sky - Velvet gets her rematch from back in December at Turning Point while Gail had Madison in her corner to try to cause distractions but it almost backfired right at the start when Velvet shocked her with an inside cradle. Gail focused on Velvet's midsection with various kicks, stretches, and submissions like the Dragon Sleeper but took some punishment of her own when she charged hard into the corner only for her to go right through & hit her back on the cage while Velvet had some offense of her own with a sunset flip powerbomb off the top rope, twisting head scissors, and bulldog. This was one of those matches where you can tell that they were working hard but it was just missing something to make it all come together.

Matt Morgan vs. Crimson - You could tell in the early moments what each man's intentions were as Crimson kept trying to escape & end the match early while Morgan at one point had a chance to walk out the door but didn't only to dish out more punishment. Crimson took out Morgan's leg with a clip & followed up with power moves like the spinebuster before Morgan would recover with his own set of power moves like the spinning clothesline & a crossbody that sandwitched Crimson against the cage but it was when Morgan missed his Carbon Footprint hitting the cage that Crimson was able to regain the advantage. Both men are limited in what they could do so they made the best of it but the finish completely killed any real heat the match could have had.

Jeff Hardy vs. Kurt Angle - Angle came into this match with his knee heavily taped but dominated right from the start & resorted to dirty tactics the minute Hardy started to mount some momentum but Hardy still brought the fight only for it to keep backfiring like his springboard kick in the corner had him hurt himself by landing on his own head & later his own momentum being used by Kurt to launch himself into the cage as Kurt continued to bring the pain as Hardy head was busted open from it being grinded into the cage & throwing it into the cage over & over again. Hardy finally got some offense in including a Twist Of Fate/Stunner combination before Angle bounced back catching Hardy on the top rope for an Angle Slam as they really picked up the pace & hit move after move from Hardy countering Kurt's anklelock into one of his own followed by two Swanton Bombs that had Hardy's entire weight crash on top of Kurt's chest before Hardy counter the Angle Slam with one of his own followed by his own Swanton Bomb off the top of the cage. This match told the story well of Hardy trying to beat Angle at his own game & definitely was the match of the night.

Knockouts Tag Team Champions O.D.B. & Eric Young vs. Serena & Rosita - O.D.B. was out for revenge against the two women who tried to ruin her wedding & was dominate from the start including throwing one girl into the other to the point where the girls had to keep double teaming to get the advantage while continuing to seduce Young. This was your typical silliness in regards to Eric Young.

TNA Champion Bobby Roode vs. James Storm - Roode was taking his time getting into the cage so Storm went out after him & knocked him down with one punch followed by Storm dishing out the punishment to Roode by getting thrown into guardrails, head bouncing off the steps & announce table, and brawling in the isleway. Storm ended up getting busted open first after being thrown into the cage before both men finally made it inside the cage to start with Roode continuing to beat on Storm's head & grinding it into the cage. Roode tried to escape when Storm got his second wind but that didn't work with him getting catapulted & thrown into the cage causing him to start bleeding as well before being the victim of a back to back double knees to the face (Jericho's Code Breaker) & back (Carlito's Backstabber). This just got more physically violent with both men taking turns ramming their heads into the cage, Storm doing the Code Breaker coming off from the top rope, Roode applying the crossface, referee getting knocked out, and the infamous beer bottle coming into play. This match led up to the hype & long term months long build between the former Beer Money partners.

Overall I'll say that this was one of the most disappointing LockDown events in the history of TNA as a majority of the matches either had no business being on of this their biggest events of the year or just never really picked up the pace & left first gear while the Lethal LockDown match more than anything else was missing that ""Holy Crap"" moment or any real suspense. The only two matches that were worth a second viewing were the Angle/Hardy & Roode/Storm but past that, this is an event you can pass on.",1352160000,3,7859,4.4407484407484406
