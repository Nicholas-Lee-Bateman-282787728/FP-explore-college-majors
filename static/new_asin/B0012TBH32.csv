8247744,4,B0012TBH32,It's wonderful when there are several sci-fi movies in one package. And this one had a whopping SIX! Each one has its own DVD so you can always choose the one you enjoyed the best and not have to look at them all. This proved to be a good advantage. Try not to take the movie too seriously; you will enjoy it better. Its meant to be entertaining and it is for the most part. Happy viewing!,1329523200,,389,4.064935064935065
8247745,3,B0012TBH32,"Disaster Films Collector Set is one of those must haves for the days when it's snowing sideways on Saturday morning and you just want to grab your hot chocolate, stay in your pj's and watch a good old disaster flick. Don't expect a likeness to the higher budget movies from this genre, but all in all it is good entertainment.",1323648000,,326,4.45

8247747,5,B0012TBH32,"This collection of quality disaster movies has something for everyone. 10.5 Apocalypse with it's 10.5 earthquake, tears apart the West Coast; in Category 7 the world faces a deadly Category 7 storm, as nature and man collide; With a too hot to handle Supernova, an astrophysicist discovers that the sun is set to explode; in Disaster Zone, a volcano beneath New York City is only one of many things that the city and its inhabitants have to deal with; in The Black Hole, a threatening black hole appears over St. Louis and threatens to destroy mankind; and, in Final Days of Planet Earth an archaeologist discovers that aliens are harvesting human remains. You'll have to see them all, because hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes and such are only Science Fiction... right? They are all a fun ride with decent acting!",1271203200,6,816,4.920289855072464
8247748,4,B0012TBH32,"Back in the 80's I would have taped each one of these movies and jammed them all onto one cheap video tape. Then I would have watched them over and over until the tape wore out. That's what we did back in the Stone Age. But now this nice company has come and put them all on a few DVDs for me. I have to say that I enjoyed all the movies in this collection, to varying degrees. The two key elements to a disaster flick are the Special Effects and the Human Drama. Both elements are represented with High Cheesiness in this set. They're fun movies, plain and simple.

FINAL DAYS OF PLANET EARTH-This should have been called the Final Days of Broadcast TV movies. It's more or less a cheap copy of the great 80's mini-series ""V"", except the aliens are insects instead of reptiles. And that nowadays I think Darryl Hannah really looks like that.

SUPERNOVA- Peter Fonda, Tia Carrera, Emma Samms and Luke Perry team up to save the world from our exploding sun! Whew! Well as long as it's THOSE guys on the job, I'm not worried! Made for the Hallmark Channel this one is short on good FX and a bit long on padding but it fondly reminds me of those end-of-the-world movies from the 50's and 60's like When Worlds Collide and The Day the Earth Caught Fire.

THE BLACK HOLE- Thanks to SciFi Channel production values and the acting prowess of Kristy Swanson and Judd Nelson this movie itself actually IS a black hole. Some scientists accidently create a black hole in St. Louis (the Mecca of black hole research) and unleash an energy eating alien as well. This one is near the bottom of the SciFi Channel garbage heap.

CATEGORY 7: THE END OF THE WORLD! - Jam packed with cheesy FX and even cheesier plotlines, this CBS mini-series reminds me of a bigger, more modern version of movies like Earthquake. It features Gina Gershon, Robert Wagner, Shannon Doherty and Randy ""Cousin Eddie"" Quaid as Tornado Tommy Dixon. Now that's what I'm talkin' about!

DISASTER ZONE: VOLCANO IN NEW YORK CITY- Well the title tells you what's gonna happen and the SciFi Channel imprint tells you how cheap it's gonna look. Michael Ironside plays the mad scientist who starts all the trouble, so that's not so bad.

10.5 APOCOLYPSE- Kim Delany, Dean Cain, Frank Langella and Melissa Sue Anderson lead a cast of brave lil actors who try to cope with a cataclysmic earthquake that not only trashes the West Coast but also threatens to split the North American Continent in half. And if that's not enough, there are two, count them two possible nuclear holocausts thrown into the mix. It's not bad, but it could use a bit more eye candy.",1266364800,25,2607,4.524416135881104
