2966710,5,B000WC8CLU,"I was hoping that more of Harry Langdon's films would come to be seen (after fearing that time & neglect had ruined most of his work). Kino Video has already released his three hugely successful feature films (the ones which built his reputation as a serious rival to Chaplin, Keaton & Lloyd). But his shorts with Sennett have never been spotlighted until now.
While Langdon's success is partly owed to prodigies such as Frank Capra, there's no doubt that Langdon himself was these film's genuine treasure, using his comic timing & pantomimic skills to make them special.
I'll be anxiously awaiting the release of this DVD package along with many others who want to see more of this neglected silent film clown.",1194825600,19,711,4.836065573770492
2966711,5,B000WC8CLU,"For anyone who loves silent films & comedy, sound or silent, must see this package. It is so sad how a star of this magnitude is overlooked & cut very short. Langdon is this example. Even Harold Lloyd tried helping his career, so he had some great pals helping him. In the DVD it is said that Chaplin had one star that intimidated him;it was Langdon. That's how strong a star he was.
For Langdson afficionados, I was impressed of films I've tried to see for 40 years but was never recovered, here in this package INCLUDING an 'infomercial' for GOODRICH tires that was never put in his filmography till now. The commentaries were excellent,except for one who got so technical about film stock that it was boring(HIS FIRST FLAME).
At least his son, Harry Langdon, the famous LA photographer is doing well. Too bad that they didn't interview for this package BUT highly recommended for ANY comedy fans to check the evolution of great comedians. Thanks Harry!!!",1220832000,5,957,4.7023809523809526
2966712,5,B000WC8CLU,"Like many other fans of silent film comedy, I was initially introduced to Harry Langdon through the compilations of Robert Youngson (THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY (1957), WHEN COMEDY WAS KING (1960)). Among the numerous gifted clowns presented there, Harry was the one new find that captivated me the most (yes, even more than Buster Keaton, and I knew Chaplin from before). I adored his character for all its odd traits and unpredictable reactions. Granted, my admiration for Keaton grew fast and I quickly regarded him as Chaplin's one true rival, but I did not forget Harry and the great curiosity he had evoked in me. However, when I finally got to see his features, I must admit I felt slightly puzzled. The gags felt far and between, and were, I thought, often performed rather slow. While I still enjoyed Langdon in excerpts, he became hard to watch for longer periods.

Do you recognize yourself a bit here? If so, you may belong to the crowd of people who have more or less given Harry up by now, and consider him to be overrated. Then, my friend, I am afraid that you have, as I did, missed the point. Not unlike when I watched W.C. Fields for the first time, what Harry seemed not to give me, turned out to really be something I failed to recognize. It is not first and foremost for his gags that Langdon stands out (although he was an excellent gagman); it is the pace he performs these gags with that is remarkable, and so different from anyone else at the time. With this new DVD-set from Facets, LOST AND FOUND: THE HARRY LANGDON COLLECTION, we are, possibly for the first time, given opportunity to trace the development of Langdon's character, and hence understand him in a proper context. In his first film, PICKING PEACHES from early 1924, he is rather similar to ""any"" other clown, milking gags in traditional manner. Just a few films into the set, though, Langdon's character has evolved into something distinctly original; his slow rhythm is actually his greatest strength. Whereas Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd tended to take the best advantage they could out of a predicament, Harry Langdon appears genuinely overwhelmed by the world around him, slowing everything down once he enters, and being hilarious (and slightly bizarre) in his struggle to perform the simplest tasks. One typical example includes the instances when he walks away from an embarrassing situation, then changes direction back to us, only to then change direction AGAIN (and then maybe again). Only a really secure performer could ever achieve such insecurity so spontaneously. His character is not so often funny for what he does as for the very fact that it is HE who does it; a gag which would seem weak and stupid in the hands of Chaplin gets hysterical with Harry.

The problem is that we who are alive today are not exposed to silent film comedy the way movie-going people were in the 1920s (no, not even diehard fans such as myself). We are unable to really appreciate how fresh and unique Langdon was from other comedians in his time. Therefore, it is important to watch each film in this set in chronological order (excluding the many extras), particularly to anyone who don't quite get Langdon. I was fortunate enough to quickly realize this; not ONCE throughout the viewing did I get back the uneasy feeling of previous days. My top favorites in this set have got to be THE FIRST 100 YEARS, THE HANSOM CABMAN, ALL NIGHT LONG, IN THE WOOD, SATURDAY AFTERNOON, SOLDIER MAN and the feature HIS FIRST FLAME (which I previously didn't like), but all films are enjoyable and the documentary is a treat. Harry Langdon was a unique comic genius. Long live his work. (This review has later been somewhat revised.)",1215388800,3,3701,4.736434108527132
2966713,4,B000WC8CLU,"The most likely explanation for the meteoric rise and fall of Harry Langdon's film career are his late start in movies (age 40) and portrayal of a child/man innocent-- a character that didn't translate well in the early talkie era-- Langdon's attempts at falsetto  would occasionally lapse into his natural baritone.

LOST AND FOUND: THE HARRY LANGDON COLLECTION consists primarily of shorts made during the height of Langdon's popularity. Bonus features on these four DVDs include alternate versions, never before seen clips, audio commentaries and interviews, Harry's home movies, a 1942 music video and a Langdon documentary. Video quality throughout is remarkably good.

2966714,5,B000WC8CLU,"It plainly obvious that everyone here that has reviewed this set is a fan of Langdon's,  look at all those stars! I too am going to add 5 stars to the rest. This set is worth every cent. My introduction to Harry was through Buster Keaton, I wanted to know who else was out there at the time of Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd and saw Harry's face staring at me through time, and I just had to know more.  I purchased The Forgotton Clown and after having watched them time after time I had to know more.  I was so excited to see this set.  6 hours of stuff to watch. There is a brilliant documentary that discusses his rise and fall and the many reasons for it.  You get to see Harry's Roach talkies which help demostrate why Harry didn't succeed and so many extras. The home movies are both profound and funny.  I would not be without this now,  I cant wait for the Threes and Crowd and The Chaser set coming out later this year.  Yeah Harry is not for all, but if he's for you then so is this set.",1210809600,4,992,4.077319587628866
2966715,5,B000WC8CLU,"I have not reviewed on Amazon before, but when I got an email from Amazon suggesting I review this purchase, I could not resist. This is the perfect example of what a collection of silent comedies should be: the best prints that can be found of often rare material, pieced together from various sources; effective musical tracks, that help the movie, not call attention to themselves; commentary tracks on every single film, which give you great historical background on the movies, and even a informative if low-budget documentary. Now as to whether you will like Harry Langdon himself, he is an acquired taste, but anyone who really appreciates silent comedy for the art form it is should enjoy his films. Also anyone who likes Stan Laurel should appreciate Langdon, who was a big influence on Laurel's comedy style.",1200787200,10,818,4.934782608695652
2966716,5,B000WC8CLU,"This is an excellent collection of an unjustly overlooked comedian.  For the most part, the prints are superb - among the best I have seen - and although the commentaries tend to duplicate themselves occasionally (perhaps understandable due to the sheer number of them), they provide an excellent education about the comedian for the uninitiated.

Langdon is definitely not your father's Oldsmobile.  He is a hard sell to an audience that does not have the patience or attention span to wait for the small flits, misdirections, and half smiles that constitute a fair amount of his comic repetoire.  I was struck by the comment (on the documentary) that Walter Kerr used to show a couple of ""typical"" silent comedies prior to showing a Langdon to a crowd to get them warmed up to his function in the silent comedy world.  It actually seems like it might be a good idea!

I did mention the print quality.  Apart from the slightly irritating habit of placing a number of title styles within a single film (as many as four or five in some instances), I thought they did an excellent job.  The soundtracks ranged from outstanding to curious, but never seriously detracted from my enjoyment of the films, and often enhanced it.  I did notice that the print of ""Lucky Stars"" excised a cheap racial joke (Langdon re-reads his fortune about ""falling in love with a dark woman"", and sees a black woman in the crowd, which both puzzles and worries him), but as much as I pine for complete prints, I don't feel much harm was done!

This set is a bargain, and it is essential for any student of silent comedy.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  If the restored prints of ""Fiddlesticks"" (an AMAZING comedy), ""Saturday Afternoon"", ""Remember When"", and ""His MArriage Wow"" were all we got, it would still be worth the price.",1200441600,15,1811,4.714285714285714
2966717,5,B000WC8CLU,"As good as it gets!

As the booklet that comes with set indicates, there are two types of people:  Those who get Harry Langdon and Those who don't get Harry Landon.  I'll add to it that there's a 3rd type:  Those who don't know who Harry Langdon is.  Hopefully this set will bring Harry back into the realm where he belongs and everyone will know and love Harry.

I won't go into the contents of this set as others have done this already.  I just got the set yesterday so I haven't seen it all but most of it is laugh out loud funny.  Just watch ""Smile Please"" and you'll laugh out loud during the last 10 minutes.  That little brat is a great actor and great foil for Harry.  It's very funny!

So if you want to get Harry, GET HARRY...that means get this box set.",1199318400,10,764,4.129251700680272
2966718,5,B000WC8CLU,"THE HARRY LANGDON COLLECTION: LOST AND FOUND is one of those rare opportunities where a cinematic wrong gets to be righted and cinematic history gets to be rewritten. This amazing compilation not only traces the evolution of Harry Langdon's screen character before his entry into feature films but shows us what Mack Sennett comedies from the 1920s were like which is invaluable as most of this material is lost. It shows that Sennett was quite capable of adapting and polishing his style as movies evolved while remaining true to himself and that Langdon already had his essential character developed from his vaudeville days before he was discovered and refined by Frank Capra as claimed in his autobiography THE NAME ABOVE THE TITLE. It also shows us much, much more. For example SMILE PLEASE from 1924 while not typical Langdon is among the funniest shorts I've seen in years thanks to Harry's reactions to the Sennett style chaos surrounding him.

This 4 DVD set follows Langdon from his first Sennett short (PICKING PEACHES) through his sound career in the 1930s when like Buster Keaton he was consigned to low budget appearances with low budget studios. It skips over his feature film period which is well represented elsewhere (Kino's HARRY LANGDON: THE FORGOTTEN CLOWN collection) although it has his rarely seen first feature HIS FIRST FLAME. The quality of the restored material is remarkable and there is also a wonderful documentary LOST AND FOUND which gives an overview of his career and contributions to silent comedy as well as numerous bonus features and commentary. As the availability of long lost films has helped to reestablish Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle's reputation, surely this set will do the same for Langdon for there is so much that we haven't seen that now paints a very different picture of the comedian. He is finally receiving the true recognition he deserves. This set is absolutely essential for silent comedy fans.",1199145600,35,1947,5.027863777089784

Yes, he's up there with the others from that era . I hope this DVD has lots of comedy & dance bits in it. I have seen only one Harry film it was called the Head Guy . It was a great film with lots of funny parts & funny dacing in it that harry did. I know this dvd pack will have lots of fun things in it I really hope so. Harry was the one & only person that always makes me laugh & put on a happy smile on my face. He's one of a kind & will never be forgotten in my book.

2966720,5,B000WC8CLU,"If you have never heard of Harry Langdon, don't be surprised. In the 1920's, he made silent comedy that ranked with Charlie Chaplin, Harlod Lloyd, and Buster Keaton. Mack Sennett called him the best comic he ever saw. And a young writer director named Frank Capra worked with him. But when he tried to direct himself in the late 20's, his career began to stall, and when talkie films came in, he had trouble fitting in. He did continue to work in films, doing films for Columbia and Educational, and also writing for Laurel and Hardy, most notable in A chump at Oxford and Flying Deuces. He died in 1944 virtually forgotten. Robert Youngston included some clips from Harry's films in his compilations.
Three of his best features, Tramp Tramp Tramp, The strong Man, and Long Pants have been available from Kino video. Finally, many of the films he made for Sennett are finally coming complete to DVD. This set also includes commentary from film historians, a documentary feature about Harry and his career, and more. At long last, this forgotten comedy Genius will finally, hopefully, take his proper place alongside the greats of comedy. When I get this set, I will update this review with sound and picture quality comments.",1194825600,16,1225,4.81042654028436

The soundtracks ranged from outstanding to curious, but never seriously detracted from my enjoyment of the films, and often enhanced it.  I did notice that the print of ""Lucky Stars"" excised a cheap racial joke (Langdon re-reads his fortune about ""falling in love with a dark woman"", and sees a black woman in the crowd, which both puzzles and worries him), but as much as I pine for complete prints, I don't feel much harm was done!

This set is a bargain, and it is essential for any student of silent comedy.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  If the restored prints of ""Fiddlesticks"" (an AMAZING comedy), ""Saturday Afternoon"", ""Remember When"", and ""His MArriage Wow"" were all we got, it would still be worth the price.",1200441600,15,1811,4.714285714285714

As the booklet that comes with set indicates, there are two types of people:  Those who get Harry Langdon and Those who don't get Harry Landon.  I'll add to it that there's a 3rd type:  Those who don't know who Harry Langdon is.  Hopefully this set will bring Harry back into the realm where he belongs and everyone will know and love Harry.

I won't go into the contents of this set as others have done this already.  I just got the set yesterday so I haven't seen it all but most of it is laugh out loud funny.  Just watch ""Smile Please"" and you'll laugh out loud during the last 10 minutes.  That little brat is a great actor and great foil for Harry.  It's very funny!

3201215,5,B000WC8CLU,"THE HARRY LANGDON COLLECTION: LOST AND FOUND is one of those rare opportunities where a cinematic wrong gets to be righted and cinematic history gets to be rewritten. This amazing compilation not only traces the evolution of Harry Langdon's screen character before his entry into feature films but shows us what Mack Sennett comedies from the 1920s were like which is invaluable as most of this material is lost. It shows that Sennett was quite capable of adapting and polishing his style as movies evolved while remaining true to himself and that Langdon already had his essential character developed from his vaudeville days before he was discovered and refined by Frank Capra as claimed in his autobiography THE NAME ABOVE THE TITLE. It also shows us much, much more. For example SMILE PLEASE from 1924 while not typical Langdon is among the funniest shorts I've seen in years thanks to Harry's reactions to the Sennett style chaos surrounding him.

This 4 DVD set follows Langdon from his first Sennett short (PICKING PEACHES) through his sound career in the 1930s when like Buster Keaton he was consigned to low budget appearances with low budget studios. It skips over his feature film period which is well represented elsewhere (Kino's HARRY LANGDON: THE FORGOTTEN CLOWN collection) although it has his rarely seen first feature HIS FIRST FLAME. The quality of the restored material is remarkable and there is also a wonderful documentary LOST AND FOUND which gives an overview of his career and contributions to silent comedy as well as numerous bonus features and commentary. As the availability of long lost films has helped to reestablish Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle's reputation, surely this set will do the same for Langdon for there is so much that we haven't seen that now paints a very different picture of the comedian. He is finally receiving the true recognition he deserves. This set is absolutely essential for silent comedy fans.",1199145600,35,1947,5.027863777089784

Yes, he's up there with the others from that era . I hope this DVD has lots of comedy & dance bits in it. I have seen only one Harry film it was called the Head Guy . It was a great film with lots of funny parts & funny dacing in it that harry did. I know this dvd pack will have lots of fun things in it I really hope so. Harry was the one & only person that always makes me laugh & put on a happy smile on my face. He's one of a kind & will never be forgotten in my book.

3201217,5,B000WC8CLU,"If you have never heard of Harry Langdon, don't be surprised. In the 1920's, he made silent comedy that ranked with Charlie Chaplin, Harlod Lloyd, and Buster Keaton. Mack Sennett called him the best comic he ever saw. And a young writer director named Frank Capra worked with him. But when he tried to direct himself in the late 20's, his career began to stall, and when talkie films came in, he had trouble fitting in. He did continue to work in films, doing films for Columbia and Educational, and also writing for Laurel and Hardy, most notable in A chump at Oxford and Flying Deuces. He died in 1944 virtually forgotten. Robert Youngston included some clips from Harry's films in his compilations.
Three of his best features, Tramp Tramp Tramp, The strong Man, and Long Pants have been available from Kino video. Finally, many of the films he made for Sennett are finally coming complete to DVD. This set also includes commentary from film historians, a documentary feature about Harry and his career, and more. At long last, this forgotten comedy Genius will finally, hopefully, take his proper place alongside the greats of comedy. When I get this set, I will update this review with sound and picture quality comments.",1194825600,16,1225,4.81042654028436
8222522,4,B000WC8CLU,"Most critics regard Harry Langdon's highpoint as the three features he made for First National Pictures under Frank Capra's guidance as director or lead writer.  Those three features, The Strong Man, Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, and Long Pants, are not included in this collection but can be found on another DVD, Harry Langdon the Forgotten Clown.  This DVD presents all his other recoverable movie work leading up to and down from his peak. It also contains an excellent 1 hour and 15 minute documentary of Langdon's life and short movie career which helps explains his rapid rise and fall. A true Langdon fan can't do without this fuller collection of his work. Someone who had previously seen only one of Langdon's great features might be disappointed by many of the Keystone 2-reelers oontained here.

The collection is organized chronologically beginning with a dozen 2-reelers made for Keystone in 1924-25, that's a movie every two months, not counting a feature released  later. Langdon is still learning film performing after a 20 year stint in vaudeville. These films are often more Mack Sennett than Harry Langdon and probably not the best place to start viewing this collection.  If one is looking for Landon's best work, jump to Disk 3 and try it's last two films: Soldier Man and especially His First Flame. Another approach might be to start with the Langdon documentary on Disk 4 to grasp the man and the career before seeing the films.  Disk 4 also shows Langdon could be funny in a sound film later in his career.",1369267200,3,1523,4.861003861003861
8222523,4,B000WC8CLU,"For anyone already knowledgeable in silent film comedy, this collection is a gem.  It is wonderful to see the development of Langdon's character from just another Sennett comedian to the unique persona that he eventually developed, from his first film with Sennett to his last.  In order to make this as complete a look at Langdon's Sennett work as possible, among the collection are films just recently restored, until now not seen by the public in decades.  And the commentaries, while not always inspired, are consistently intelligent and informative, and help the viewer recognize the development of the Langdon character from film to film, and the influence that Langdon had on comedy in general, and on certain comedians in particular, particularly Stan Laurel.

For me, the experience of viewing this collection went beyond a mere increased appreciation for Harry Langdon.  It has deepened my affection for his character.  Since viewing Lost and Found, the Harry Langdon Collection, I have become a Harry Langdon fan!

However, this collection is not a good introduction for a newcomer to the comedy of Harry Langdon.  It would be much better to get a collection of silent classics which represent Langdon at his best.  The early films here are typical Sennett comedies that hardly show off Langdon's unique gifts.  And among the restored work are films in fragmentary or incomplete condition which, while greatly appreciated by anyone in the know, may be difficult for others to watch.  So as much as I and those with as much or greater experience in silent film may treasure this collection, it is definitely not for everyone.",1357171200,2,1635,5.063432835820896
8222524,5,B000WC8CLU,"This is a wonderful collection. I took the precaution of ""previewing"" all four discs on Netflix, so this took away some element of discovery. However, I still jumped at the chance of owning a copy. This covers the highlights of Langdon's Sennett years - many films that were old Blackhawk catalog favorites, or only highlighted in the Robert Youngson compilation films; the last disk includes several Educational shorts, a promo comedy for BF Goodrich, and a Soundie, of all things. There's also insightful commentary, good bonus features, and a very interesting documentary/discussion of Langdon's life and career. All Day Entertainmnent also produced BECOMING CHARLEY CHASE, so this is a worthy partner to that collection, as well as the Langdon First National features available from Kino. Langdon may not be as easy to appreciate as Chaplin, Lloyd, or Keaton, but this collection gives you a good overview of how he progressed from typical Sennett slapstick gags to his own unnique style.",1343520000,,992,5.20625
8222525,4,B000WC8CLU,"I work with a guy who doesn't know what a Silent Movie is. I would bet that most people don't know what they are missing, especially with a talent like Harry Langdon. Without the technology to convey voice, facial expressions and mannerisms and occasional dialog boxes tell each story. Langdon's innocent, clueless expression of naivety, contemplation and discovery, enhance the hapless roles he played. I have watched ""Tramp, Tramp, Tramp"" to the talky ""Zenobia"" with Oliver Hardy. With these two titles as basically ""bookends"" to a career, there are a lot of laughs and good times in between.

 ""Tramp, Tramp, Tramp"" is my favorite silent as the son of a shoemaker falls in love with the face of mogol shoemaker's daughter played by Joan Crawford as displayed on an advertising billboard. As they prepare to start the walk across the country to win the grand prize, he is caught admiring her ""Billboard face"", by the object of his affection. His reaction to his first face to face encounter, just steps away, is charmingly hilarious and heart warming.

With the race getting underway, calamity is as close as the mogol's labels inside Langdon's race shoes. How does he do??? You may break a sweat from laughter on Harry Langdon, as I did. Just enjoy!",1322611200,,1252,4.868544600938967
8222526,5,B000WC8CLU,"It's great to see these shorts finally released on DVD. The prints are really clean, and the scoring is tastefully done. Harry Langdon, in my opinion is one of the greatest comedians and directors of all-time, and this set certainly does him justice. I really couldn't say enough positive things about this set.

My only 'complaints' (if one could even call them that), are there's a couple more shorts I would have liked to have seen added. It may very well have been that the titles weren't available, or there were copyright issues. And the commentators seem to have gotten a bit of disinformation regarding the short ""Love, Honor, and Obey (The Law), mistakenly crediting to Educational Pictures. An honest mistake, and not one that effects the over-all greatness of this collection.

A must-have for any fan of Harry Langdon or silent comedies.",1297555200,,849,4.93006993006993
8222527,5,B000WC8CLU,"Chaplin said he ""Only felt threatened by Harry Langdon"", Samuel Becket wanted Langdon for his experimental Film, but had to use Keaton after Langdon's early death, James Agee, Kevin Brownlow, Walter Kerr, Robert Youngson, Harold Lloyd and Mack Sennett were among those who sang high praises for Langdon's art while Stan Laurel, Jacques Tati's Mr. Hulot, Steve Martin, Andy Kaufman, and Pee Wee Herman were all profoundly influenced by him. Yet, even the mere mention of Harry Langdon will send many of that annoying breed identified as ""classic slapstick lovers"" into a disturbed, eye-twitching frenzy.

Langdon's characterization expressed the most pronounced silence of the era's clowns, which is why, despite his fans' claims (on the documentary) sound proved completely disastrous for him. Langdon's persona was only suited to the abstract plane that silent cinema offered. It is easy to see why he appealed so readily to the surrealists. His persona is dream-like, subconsciously other world. Langdon's man-child seems to exist within an elfin id. Silence and make-up were existential turpentine for Langdon, removing him, layer-by-layer, from the world, as we so readily know it. Of course, for many, turpentine is unbearable and Langdon haters will pull out their hair, waiting for him to do something. Even his blink was lethargic. Frank Capra, Langdon's one time director and permanent detractor once bitched, ""It takes him an hour to get started"". Langdon was the master of anti-reaction and he did more with less than anyone, Keaton included. That's the magic of the Langdon persona. With the barest minimum, he was able to finely etch a characterization so vivid; it is second only to Chaplin in identifiable personality. It was Langdon's abundance of unique personality that so accelerated his stardom.

Langdon's equally quick fall, after a mere three years, is theoretically debated. Certainly, that same personality, combined with his admirable risk-taking, ego, and poor business skills, was partially responsible. But, after he left Sennett for the fascistic First National, with both studios releasing a plethora of his films, the result was an onslaught of Langdon product in 1927 and his considerable fan base went into massive overdose.

This stands in direct contrast to Capra's self-serving claim that he alone fashioned Langdon's screen persona. Capra further claimed that the actor had no true understanding of his own persona and when Langdon ventured into edgier territory, over Capra's populist-minded objections, the star simply imploded. With sound inevitably around the corner, combined with Langdon's advanced age in comparison to younger rivals, his desire for rapid experimentation is understandable. The risk was an artistic triumph, but a commercial disaster.

Steve Martin tried something similar with a brief series of films that pushed his own boundaries. When the payoff proved popularly lackluster, Martin predictably receded back into the safety of the mainstream. Langdon received no chance for reprieve with First National.

He alone was blamed for the disappointing box office results of Three's a Crowd (1927) and The Chaser (1928). His third directed feature for the studio, Heart Trouble (1928), was never released and reportedly was destroyed. By most accounts, it would have proven to be his commercial rebound effort, but lamentably the film seems to be forever lost.

Harry Langdon was and remains an idiosyncratic, enigmatic, minimalist ""anti-clown"". For many a novice, he appears a sort of inexplicably surreal forerunner to the Stan Laurel child-like persona. Yet, unlike Stan, Harry's character had an amorous nature, which became progressively dark-hued, reaching the breaking point, for early fans at least, when he fantasized about murdering his fiance in the Capra directed Long Pants (1927) and in his own much maligned, masterpiece of existential pathos, Three's a Crowd.

When Mack Sennett landed a contract with Langdon in 1924, formulaic slapstick had run its course. Sennett, ever the shrewd businessman, knew he desperately needed a breath of fresh air and got it in spades with Langdon. Langdon was already forty, considerably older than the energetic, youthful Chaplin, Keaton or Lloyd and already had an impressive critical, popular reputation from his vaudeville act.

Since several studios were vigorously courting Langdon, Sennett was lucky to nab him and did not intend to waste his investment. This beautifully re-mastered and essential collection from All-Day Entertainment/ Facets Video contains the surviving Sennett films, along with a good, but repetitive documentary and a few random, painfully wretched, depressing sound shorts on a bonus disc.

The first disc in this collection shows Langdon's character quickly evolving and, within a mere six months, that characterization is richly molded. The second and third discs contain the treasure trove. Giving lie to Capra's claim All Night Long (1924) is the first Langdon masterpiece, with his character firmly in place, directed by the underrated Harry Edwards, not Capra. As one commentator states, these shorts, so detailed in personality and plot, seem very much like feature films. All Night Long pairs Langdon with his two best co-stars; Vernon Dent and Natalie Kingston. These actors were perfect, complimentary foils for Langdon and both remain horribly underrated.

Dent might be likened to an Oliver Hardy type sidekick, except that Dent was a far more versatile actor than Hardy ever was (that is no swipe on Babe). Dent typically played Langdon's burly Bluto-like bully, but resonated far more character actor depth in his portrayal of Professor McGlumm in His Marriage Wow (1925). Dent's pessimist professor is downright creepy, matching Langdon's paused, minimal expressiveness with priceless, under the skin glances. Dent's McGlumm bares an uncanny, eerie resemblance to Robert Helpmann's Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) and, at the end, he reveals himself to be none other than the infamous Barney Google of the 1920's comic strip.

Kingston is equally priceless: tall, stylishly dark, incredibly sexy, and evoking true, expressionistic danger. She is both Jezebel and Delilah, seducing and attempting to murder Langdon in both Lucky Stars (1925) and Soldier Man (1926). Langdon, Dent and Kingston make for a unique trio in all of their films together. Kingston is Sgt. Dent's girl in All Night Long, but only until lowly K.P private Langdon unwittingly steals her away.

For his betrayal, Langdon's private is banished to the war front of the surreal No Man's Land, only to triumphantly shift through the inexplicable circumstances he finds himself thrown into, something akin to Betty Boop's Minnie The Moocher or Peter Sellers' Chance the Gardener, and winning Kingston in the process.

Another, unaccredited co-star might be the dummy in Feet of Mud (1924), which again co-starred Dent (as his football coach) and Kingston (as the rich girlfriend). Through elongated, almost plastic, repetitive reactions, Langdon interacts with a mannequin, mistaking it for a real person. It is a surreal bit of business Langdon explored time and again.

Along with All Night Long, Lucky Stars and Saturday Afternoon (1926) may be the best of the distinguished lot. In the richly plotted Lucky Stars, Langdon pursues his astrological sign and joins a medicine show. Little doubt, Langdon's own background colored the tale since he ran away from home to join an Indian medicine show at the age of twelve. Dent is marvelous here as Langdon's seasoned quack instructor. Dent is equally impressive in Saturday Afternoon; a precursor to many a Laurel & Hardy plot, as Langdon's good old union boy date buddy, ambitious to secure an afternoon with a couple of those ""tomatoes with the gorgeous lamps"". Langdon's charming, little boy lost reaction to a kiss shared between Dent and his date is expressively sublime.

In the enormously popular Fiddlesticks (1926) Dent takes on two roles as Langdon's fragile fatalism soars the heights that would come to crystallization in Three's a Crowd. Langdon propels the viewer deep into the discomfort zone when he dons drag in The Sea Squawk (1925). Pee Wee Herman masturbating in an adult theater or wearing mirrors on his shoes to look up girls' dresses has nothing on the disturbing sight of a transvestite Harry.

The pristine His First Flame (1927) reunites Langdon, Dent and Kingston in Langdon's first feature, which was released after his second feature, Capra's The Strong Man (1926). The Strong Man remains Langdon's most popular film and the film for which he is best remembered.

Langdon took Edwards, Capra, and writer Arthur Ripley to First National with him. The second feature, Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1926) went over deadline and over budget for which, unfortunately, Edwards was blamed and fired. All three of these features did well with audiences and critics alike, but it was in the third, Long Pants (1927) that the idyllic working relationship between Capra, Langdon, and Ripley became unraveled.

Capra objected to the film's darker elements. His view of the Langdon character was as an innocent child, inexplicably protected by God. But, Langdon, Ripley and Edwards, as seen in the pre-Capra All Night Long, had already developed that character concept. In Long Pants, Ripley and Langdon retained the wonder of Langdon's man-child, but jettisoned innocence in favor of less sympathetic character flaws. Langdon was selfish, vain, obstinate, stubborn, and even contemplated murder. It was Langdon and Ripley's two against Capra's one. The result was Capra's dismissal, for which the director never forgave the star.

Actually, Capra and Langdon, despite doing good work together, were aesthetically mismatched. Capra always filtered audience taste through his sensibilities, which, of course, helped him become enormously successful. Considering audience taste rarely, if ever, even occurred to Langdon, who simply forged ahead, despite the odds, much like his character.

In Three's a Crowd, Ripley and Langdon pulled on another rug. Here, Langdon transforms into something resembling Charles Schultz' perennial loser and removed any hint of divine intervention. No matter how much we may root for Harry, his character walks away with absolutely nothing. No girl, no future, no promise of Eden. If there is a God, then God mocks Harry. Harry seems to realize this and the film ends with him sending a hurling rock through the storefront window of a local soothsayer, a bit like the unjustly cursed Saul. It was too much for 1927 audiences.

The First National Features that followed are available on two Kino collections; The Forgotten Clown and Three's a Crowd. Together, these three volumes, along with the pricey, but indispensable Georges Melies box set and the sparse release of Louis Feuillade serials amount to a near gold mine in recently restored silent cinema.

8222528,4,B000WC8CLU,"Many of these films have good to almost excellent soundtracks from the kooky ""Snark Ensemble"".  A few are just too odd for me: ""Feet of Mud"", could use a much funnier, old-time sort of score, with more sound effects.  The musical score to ""All Night Long"" is too bizarre and creepy to bring out the whimsy in the film.  Andrew Simpson does VERY good piano for ""The First 100 Years."" The soundtracks mostly improve after this; ""Remember When"" is given a particularly sensitive accompaniment by Maurice Saylor.

Some people find fault with Langdon's shorts for being poorly written, or lacking good gag sequences with big laughs.  If you watch his films as character studies, rather than belly-laugh farces, I think they become much more watchable.  ""Lucky Stars"" is an example.  On the other hand, ""Feet of Mud"", ""Boobs in the Woods"" and ""Soldier Man"" strike me as very well-structured narratives and highly amusing.  But not ""laugh-out-loud"" somehow...  Supplement these with the nightmarish scenario and exquisite pantomime of ""The Hansom Cabman"", the peculiar improvisations in ""Luck of Foolish"", the Harold Lloyd-ish jokes and runaway finish in ""His Marriage Wows"", and the pure gag fest in the last sequence of ""Smile Please"", along with the occasionally excellent music scores for these films, and this compilation is certainly worthwhile.  If Saylor had written ALL the music, this would be a hands-down winning DVD set.

I was disappointed with the music to ""His First Flame"". The piano sounds electric, which is kind of sickening to my ears, and did not have the whimsy to match the comedy, or temperament to match the drama.  By contrast, if you get a chance (it's on Youtube), watch a bit of this movie from ""A2ZCDs""; the picture is hideous, but the un-named organist gives a perfect accompaniment and highlights every bit of action and comedy perfectly--except that at about a third of the way through the movie, the soundtrack ends up about 3 seconds out of sync (late) to the film.  Too bad ALLDAY Entertainment, in putting together this Lost and Found collection, did not use the organ soundtrack to the restored print (in proper sync, of course).  The difference in print quality is amazing, and the image-quality of  ""His First Flame"" in this ALLDAY collection does look stunning, particularly compared to the other edition.",1260403200,3,2340,5.010335917312662
8222529,2,B000WC8CLU,"Nothing about Langdon's individuality can save these films from being typical low-budget, slipshod Sennett productions.  The accompanying scores are dreadful and just make viewing that much more of a chore.  I'm beginning to think that 'The Strong Man' was the aberration - the more I see of Langdon the less I feel he deserves any sense of equality with Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd.  I applaud Allday for creating this set so that all can judge Langdon for themselves - but if you're listening at Allday, please give me something less avant-garde musically on your next silent project.",1234310400,2,585,5.010309278350515

Most of the short films on this DVD were presumed lost for decades, so not only are we talking great comedy but also historical significance. I have not received this collection yet, but I know it will be great. Baby Faced Harry was never given his due as one of the truly great silent film comics. For my money, his ability at pantomime was unequaled, and he was able to evoke pathos simply with a gesture of his hands or a movement of his eyes. Sadly, Harry died penniless in 1944 as a second tier performer in B comedies, his early triumphs in the 1920s virtually forgotten. But retribution is finally attained! Here we have him in his natural element: silent film, which he mastered beyond the skills of any of his peers. Harry was a great little guy with an enormous ability to make people laugh!

Langdon, in every movie included, plays an adorable childish and naive persona.

Each disc is filled with valuable shots and some interesting audio content that in my opinion perfectly serve as an educational materials for classic movie buffs.

On the other hand,I must confess that audio commentaries provided by film experts have poor audio quality resulting in my failure to learn facts and tips(This is principally why I only give 4 stars to evaluate.)
