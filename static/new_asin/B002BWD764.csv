3896103,4,B002BWD764,"Meet sorceress Lina Inverse -- she's short, flat-chested, brash, loud, eats like a barbarian, ridiculously powerful, and has a temper as hot as her fireballs.

She's also the lovable anti-heroine of ""Slayers"" The Complete Seasons 1-3 ,"" a thoroughly hilarious and warped little classic anime that spans three very different storylines. Each of the three seasons blends in plenty of  fantasy spoofs and a solid little story about good vs. evil (or justice vs. evil, depending on who you ask), when our heroes aren't dressing in drag or mugging bandit gangs.

After Lina robs a bandit gang, she finds herself being pursued by a mysterious Chimera named Zelgadis and his weird minions, and a revered blind priest named Rezo who wants to protect Lina from Zelgadis... or so he says. Fortunately she has the handsome but dumb swordsman Gourry Gabriev to help her out -- except she seems to have her enemies and her allies mixed up.

And as Lina, Gourry and Zelgadis are pursued by Rezo's monstrous allies, they learn the real reason that Rezo wants the statuette -- yes, it's to unleash ultimate evil upon the world, and all that.  But even after the threat seems to be over, the two of them -- plus a justice-happy princess named Amelia -- end up with a bounty on their heads, dodging a crazy mercenary, and a new enemy lurking in the city of Sairagg...

""Slayers Next"" reunites the gang somewhat explosively in the city of Xoana, where Zelgadis is seeking a cure for his Chimera body. But the gang's quest for the legendary Claire Bible is disrupted by the crazed Xoana princess Martina, a sorcerous feud that upends an entire city, the hunt for dragon cuisine, a magical tennis game, a tower of magic dolls and weird obstacles, a city that bans men, and a ""mysterious priest"" named Xellos who seems to have way more power than an average sorcerer should have.

But the real trouble starts when the gang makes it to Amelia's country of Sairune -- and discovers that a conspiracy of greedy royals and evil Monsters want Lina very, very dead. The gang sets out to discover the reason why on a journey riddled with Golden Dragons, malignant Monsters, and the true form of the Claire Bible. But their mysterious enemies have plans for Lina and her ultimate attack spell... which may bring about the end of the world.

""Slayers Try"" has Lina and her friends set adrift at sea during a battle with a Golden Dragon... who also happens to be her latest employer, Filia. Eventually Filia reveals why she has done all this -- a prophecy foretelling a terrible disaster that may destroy the world, which only Lina's sister (or, if she's not available, Lina) can stop. Unfortunately the gang also have a new enemy -- the vengeance-maddened Monster Valgaav, and a mysterious shadowy creature who wants Gourry's Sword of Light.

But after some nasty obstacles, Lina discovers the true intent of Valgaav's new master -- to destroy the Dark Lord Darkstar (yeah, silly name), using five weapons including the Sword of Light. When a clash with Valgaav goes horribly wrong, Lina and her friends end up scattered across the continent, with only a short time to stop the insane Dark Lord from invading their world. And finding the last of the weapons to kill Darkstar will take them deep into the bloody past of the Golden Dragons...

Spoofs of the fantasy genre are a dime a dozen. The real challenge is creating a spoof that also has a story and mythology all its own -- and ""Slayers"" succeeds brilliantly at doing that. Not only are all three seasons gutsplittingly funny, but each one has a really solid storyline and thoroughly enjoyable characters -- including some moments that are beautifully dramatic and tragic too.

Each one has basically two interconnected arcs of epic battles, with plenty of Dark Lords, uberpowered Monster lords, wizard-priests, sword duels, hidden libraries, mystical ruins, devastated cities and the occasional town being ransacked by multicoloured trolls. It's a solid enough fantasy series, and it takes the usual fantasy tropes -- big dumb guy with magic sword, sorceress, Dark Lord, plucky princess -- and promptly turns them on their heads.

And there's a lot of humour too, ranging from a horde of Lina and Gourry clones (""It's... TINY!"") to a series of running gags (""That.... is a SECRET""). At least half the episodes contain and/or end with some kind of massive explosion and possible rioting. And a couple stories wedged between the two arcs are entirely devoted to comedy -- usually they involve a more relaxed tone, with stuff about cursed jars, elderly superheroes, Gourry in drag, and the whole gang dressing up in big silly animal costumes.

Lina is a brilliant fantasy anti-heroine -- she's flat-chested, assertive, hypersensitive and wonderfully bombastic, and even her expanding arsenal of highly destructive spells doesn't make her less endearing. Swordsman Gourry is a good complement to Lina, given his childlike attitude and a tiny brain . And hyperactive princess Amelia is kind of annoying at first, but when she starts balancing out her ""justice!"" obsession with a healthy dose of reality, you start feeling fond of her.

Zelgadis is the best-rounded character of the bunch, since he starts as a semi-villain but soon reveals that his only real goal is to become a human being again. And Xellos is a priceless character -- he flits in and out, causing trouble just for the fun of it, announcing that whatever he's talking about ""is a SECRET,"" and sometimes he even turns against Lina and Co. Despite all that, you end up really, really liking him.

The first three seasons of ""Slayers"" make up a solid fantasy series that also happens to be a hysterically funny spoof, with brilliantly solid plots and likable characters. Definitely a must-see.",1244505600,21,5779,4.876656472986748

3896107,3,B002BWD764,"The series themselves are absolutely amazing, 5 stars for that part.
I have however 2 gripes about this product;

1) As other reviewers have mentioned the packaging is REALLY cheap and flimsy. It feels as if it would come apart in your hands if you'd watch the episodes more than once. Laminated paper and sticky tape, this has to be done better ! It feels nothing like an official licensed end-product.

2) The encoding of the video streams is really bad. Perhaps due to low quality source material, but more likely due to cramming too many episodes on each disk and mastering with some weird conservative default settings.

I would've definitively paid more for a better quality version, had I known this beforehand.",1508025600,,718,4.821138211382114

3896110,5,B002BWD764,"This series was a very fun one to watch. Usually during longer runs, like this show has, you will get a bunch of filler episodes in there, that look as if they were put in there just to fill in the episode number request. This show really did not have many, if any, of them, so, what you get is a show that you do not get tired of. I felt that each season had it own ending, that make it feel like you could stop there, and not miss anything.. But then the next season started up seamlessly. This is nice because, if you decide to stop at season 3,a nd not go for season 4 and 5, you will not feel like you are missing anything.

Before I get to some info about the show, I do have to give one warning.. There is a season 4 and 5 out there of this show. They are NOT as good as the original first three seasons. The movies they did a decent job of keeping up with the shows personality, but, the seasons 4 and 5, they completely dropped a lot of the distinct, and entertaining part of Lina's personality. It almost seemed like they had a completely different writer for the last 2 seasons, and then changed her personality, to shorten the show, just to get to the ending faster. IMO, It did not work out that well.. So, for the first three seasons, I would give each of them 5 stars each. The movies I would give 4 to 5 stars each.. Seasons 4 and 5 I would go with maybe a 3 star rating.

As for the show, it is a typical magic, sorcery, demons and dragons type of show. The main character, Lina, sorcery genius, travels with a companion, Gourry, which is a top notch swordsman. But, Lina is the straight forward type of person, that loves money, and will do most things for money, is insecure about her lack of feminine charm, and has not problem throwing a fireball at someone for going there about it.. and Gourry is more of a ditsy airhead, that does not remember most things, unless it revolves around food, and has to have everything explained to him.. The comic situations that come up because of that, get very entertaining, and comical. Later on, they meet up with, and start traveling with other companions, and even gets a rival (which is more one person trying to get lina) which add to the shows appeal. Overall, it is just good clean fun to watch. If you want more details about the show, I am sure that there is a ton of other reviews that go into more details, but, I did not want to spoil the show for you.",1496534400,3,2423,4.164179104477612
3896111,5,B002BWD764,"This is a terrific series. Occasionally I like to watch an older show (you just can't beat that pure cell animation!) and bought this to satisfy that craving. I had never heard of this series and can't remember how I stumbled upon it on Amazon, but I'm glad I did.

This show can bring laughs no matter what you're doing. I have a nasty habit of doing several things at once, and even then this sucked me in. It's one of those shows that you can tell what's going on even when not paying 100% attention. But it'll be hard not to pay attention because it's so good. The characters are well rounded and likable, the stories are good, and the humor is top-notch. The show focuses on a small group of magicians and warrior(s) as they travel around their monster infested world seeking treasure and glory (and food.... mostly food.) Each of the three seasons serve as their own arc with it's own story. All of them build off of the previous seasons, but are somewhat self contained as well.

Pros:
Mostly good animation (improves each season)
Terrific humor
Good characters
Good story

Cons:
Occasional animation snafus (adds character, if you ask me!)
English dub can be questionable (though the core characters are acted pretty well)
Each season has its low points (personally I found season 3 hard to get too invested in. Can't figure out why exactly)

If you're looking for a good, old fashioned anime to relive days gone by, this is a great set! It'll also satisfy your craving for a fantasy genre piece, and since it's three full seasons, you've got days and days worth of watching. Definitely a must-have for anime fans!",1492300800,3,1622,4.621527777777778

Hey I steal from people and cause trouble but I will give advice how god and monster have nothing to do with my path but as humasn we walk a path to evolve. What hell you talking about.  This is an oxymoron.  Character is just too stupid and lacks any good directions and the story is too full of holes that is gets boring.  If your going to make a comedy make it so.

I grew up on this anime in the 90's, and I've rewatched the first season alone at least a dozen (probably more) times. If you love swords, magic, and an anime that doesn't take itself (too) seriously, you'll love Slayers.

Not to mention, Lina is probably one of the most interesting protagonists in an anime that I've ever seen. I might be biased because of nostalgic reasons, but I think Lina is amazing.

3896137,3,B002BWD764,"I'm an uber Slayers fan. I want to start out by saying this before I explain why I gave it three out of five stars and not a perfect grading. I love the show a lot, but this review is going to be about quality of the box set.

This box set is sub par compared to the Japanese releases. I understand Funimation bought the TV series from Software Sculptors. This is a problem because they barely changed anything. Sculptors did not have the quality Funimation had. Keep this in mind. It's very important.

One of the reasons this is important is because Sculptors's translation has not been that good all the time. (Funi corrected them in the later seasons in dub/sub, so I am focusing only on the first 3.)  The biggest thing with this aspect is the term ""monsters"" to describe ""mazoku"". If you're new to the series these terms are confusing because there are monsters in the series that are not ""mazoku"". The ""monster race"" is better referred to as ""demon race"" or ""evil race"". ""Ma"" means demon or evil, and ""zoku"" means race. Their name implies they are anti-thesises to the gods which this is an important part of the Slayers storyline. (It's also where Lina draws her black magic from.) The sub version does not have any corrections. (There's also misspellings on names like Gorun Nova in Next.) I understand why it was not redubbed, but I do no understand why this minor corrections in the sub at least do not take place.  Maybe I'm being nitpicky, I dunno. But I've seen other shows get better treatment.

The audio suffers the worst. The English is only in mono for god knows why. The Japanese is in stereo. This doesn't make sense. Keep in mind, that I am actually a fan of the Japanese version more and I still don't know why it's like this. It's usually reversed, the Japanese gets treated like crap.

The frame rate sucks. I'd love to get this bumped up to HD, or at least a fixed frame rate. But it's horrible as it was when I saw it on VHS. I know the show's animation is dated but jesus christ. So is Neon Genesis Evangelion and the Platinum edition box set gave it a lot of justice when they fixed the fame rate and audio. (NGE is about the same age too.) So, why can't Slayers get the same treatment? I've seen some screenshots from the Japanese discs of the earlier seasons and they seem so much better compared to ours.",1428883200,4,2336,4.408352668213457

3896143,5,B002BWD764,"The Slayers is in my opinion one of the best television shows ever created. Features a cast of heroes so flawed that at least half could be called villains, or so soft in the head they forget their own name. The fate of the world may very well depend on a greedy egomaniac with self-image issues, a ditzy swordsman, a black-hearted shaman, a self-righteous teenage healer; and occasionally a demon, housewife, dragon, or whoever else feels like accompanying them.

And you can forget finding holes in the plot. That is not to say there aren't any. But this gang will not only beat you to the punch, but make jokes about it as well. But the whole show isn't just a gag. There are some very clever surprises, and some touching or horrifying moments as well.

This only gets three stars if only for the packaging.  It's completely not worth paying the full price, just because of it.  As described with other reviews, it's in a flimsy case.  Binding the dvd holders is only a thick tape, and it easily gets uneven when you open it up to grab a dvd to watch-- and you have to remove the top dvd to get to the one on the bottom.  It's also rather fragile.  I've actually seen anime bootlegs that look more high quality than this, which is really sad because funimation has better packaging than the one this series came in, for example Baccano! as well as the other two seasons for Slayers.  The design of the packaging is cute, however, having the look of a high-quality restaurant menu that the gang loves to visit on their journey.",1288051200,5,994,4.364130434782608
3896183,5,B002BWD764,"So, there's basically no special features to this set. It's just a straight up collections of the first 3 seasons of Slayers. A good introductions to the series for those who've never seen it. It's basically a number of discs in a book-format case with a slip cover bearing the same art as the book's cover. Each of the book's ""pages"" holds two discs. While I'm not a fan of the the 2-discs-per-page format of DVD cases, it's not as terrible as I once thought it was. But I still tend to prefer 2-disc slim cases in a ""brick"" box.

Anyway, I guess there's not a whole lot more to say. The value seem good for having 3 complete seasons. The episodes play well. The series is relatively lively and fun. A bit silly, but I guess that's part of the charm of it. Certainly makes me hope they'll have a similar collected sets of the later seasons too (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolution/dp/B0030ZOYIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolution</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evolution-R/dp/B003CP62D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evolution-R</a>)...

3896184,3,B002BWD764,"The Slayers: The First Three Seasons is a twelve-disc DVD set that contains the first three seasons of The Slayers (The Slayers, Slayers Next, and Slayers Try).  Each season is broken up over four discs, and each season consists of twenty-six episodes.

Special features appear on discs four, eight, and twelve on the set.  Disc four contains a feature labeled ""Episode 1 Edit.""  This feature runs for about nine minutes, and it is made up of two scenes from the first episode (which are when Lina meets Gourry and when Lina defeats the dragon).  This feature is available in the following languages: English, Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin, Spanish, and Italian.

Disc four also contains textless songs, which are the opening and closing credits for the first season.  While there may not be any credit text included on this feature, the subtitles for the song's lyrics are still on the screen.  There are also trailers for animeOnline, Black Cat, Tsubasa, Case Closed, The Slayers (a trailer for Slayers Next), Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball Z, and the Z Store.

The first special feature on disc eight is labeled as ""Animated Music Videos.""  This feature runs for twelve minutes, and it contains five different versions of the same music video for ""Maiden's Prayer"" (a song which appeared in episode 40).  The five versions of the video are the original version, an instrumental version, only Lina's vocal and the music, only Amelia's vocal and the music, and a version with Japanese subtitles instead of English subtitles.  This particular feature became annoying rather quickly.  I became rather tired of seeing the same visuals, and only having small tweaks made to each version of the video.

There is only a textless version of the opening song on disc eight.  Just like the textless songs on disc four, there is no longer any credit text, but there are still subtitles on the screen.  A feature labeled as ""Japanese TV Spots"" runs for roughly two-and-a-half minutes.  There are no subtitles for this feature.  There are a total of seven television spots included, and they seemed to be for various Slayers recordings and games that were released.  There are also trailers for Ragnarok, Yu Yu Hakusho, The Slayers (a trailer for Slayers Try), Robotech: Shadow Chronicles, Glass Fleet, Tsubasa, Dragon Ball Z, and the Z Store.

Disc twelve didn't contain much in the way of special features.  There are textless versions of the opening and closing songs; unfortunately, this feature did not include a textless version of the song that appeared for the ending credits of the final episode of Slayers Try.  For the songs that appear on here, the credit text is gone, but the subtitles still remain.  There are also trailers for Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist, CLAMP Double Feature, Dragon Ball, Glass Fleet, and Blue Gender.

Even though the special features a little disappointing in some respects, this is really a rather economical set to purchase to acquire the first three seasons of The Slayers on DVD.  Many stores and online outlets that sell this twelve-disc set tend to charge around $60 for it.  I would definitely recommend this box set to fans of The Slayers that want to own the series on DVD.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD set that my husband purchased for me as a gift.",1281398400,,3325,4.880570409982175
3896185,4,B002BWD764,"There are plenty of serious, hard-boiled anime fantasy yarns out there. The classic ""Record of Lodoss War"" and
the more recent ""Claymore"" are some good examples. But back in the early nineties, an intrepid group of animators
decided to take a step in a bold, new direction in the fantasy genre. Instead of giving us a ""Final Fantasy""-style
tale of love, loss and war set in a land of elves and enchantresses, the studio decided to adapt a moderately
successful series of comedy-fantasy novels by Hajime Kanzaka and eschew all the typical trappings of fantasy anime.
They also decided to cast a young, talented voice actress who currently had the role of female Ranma in ""Ranma 1/2"",
thereby giving her career an extra kick into international superstardom. That studio was EG Studio, and the voice
actress was Megumi Hayashibara. And the series became one of anime's longest-running and most popular franchises
of all time: ""The Slayers.""

Following hotheaded sorceress Lisa Inverse and clumsy warrior Gourry Galbriev as they get into one action-packed
shenanigan after another, ""The Slayers"" is a perfect example of how a show doesn't need to be smart to be good.
No heavy thinking or intense attention is required for your enjoyment of this show; in fact, I would almost
encourage turning off your brain and letting it take you away. The world our heroes inhabit is one
where intense, A-Bomb-sized explosions can level cities, yet leave the protagonists unscathed; a world where
villains never aim for anything less than COMPLETE WORLD DESTRUCTION. ""Serial Experiments Lain"", this ain't.

Of course, this show does have a few flaws which bring it down a few pegs. The animation deteriorates in quality
as the series rushes on, and by halfway through the first season, some of the laughter stems from the sheer
nerve of cost-cutting measures the animators took. Another issue is that some of the filler episodes are
absolutely pathetic, and only serve a purpose as... well, as filler. Sure, some of them are moderately entertaining
(such as a particularly hilarious episode where Lina and Gourry get drafted into a stage show reenacting horribly
misconstrued versions of their journeys), but for the most part, you're going to mentally tune out of these
episodes.

What voice track you watch is completely up to you. I prefer the English dub, because it gives off a cheesy tone which
goes hand-in-hand with the whole series; I also think Lisa Ortiz does a much better job voicing Lina than Megumi
Hayashibara. The Japanese track sounds TOO high-quality, if that makes any sense; a show like this deserves campiness
for the characters' voices, not meticulously thought-out dialogs. I know some may disagree, but like I mentioned above:
it's a matter of personal preference. Each has their own merit, and both are good in their own way.

As far as this set goes: you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. The original three seasons of ""Slayers"", all for
under sixty bucks. The package design is very sturdy, and the witty interior is a restaurant menu, a tongue-and-cheek
reference to the protagonists' voracious appetites.

If you're looking for an intelligent, thought out, and lushly animated show, look elsewhere. But for the rest of us,
""Slayers"" is some of the best entertainment money can buy. Look forward to hours of fun, mindless chaos from this
set.

Animation: B- (Serviceable, but by no means is it good.)

Music: B+ (Fun, catchy background tunes, coupled with fun, catchy opening and ending themes.)

Dub: A (Fun to listen to, and takes funny liberties with the original script. Doesn't match the lip flaps frequently,
  which may bother some purists.)

Sub: A (Excellent, but TOO high-quality for an anime of this caliber; to put it simply, not cheesy enough.)

OVERALL: B+ (One of my favorites, and a worthy viewing experience for those seeking fun in it's most unadulterated form.)",1275782400,,3898,4.9984567901234565
3896186,4,B002BWD764,"Slayers was a show ahead of its time in a lot of ways. In some ways, it's still a step ahead of most attempts at fantasy anime or light novel adaptations. Watching all three series back-to-back is a great experience and the collection's price makes it a very affordable investment.

Audio afficionados take note: while the Slayers dub is rightly famed as one of the first really spot-on anime dubs, the English voice track is in mono. This is due to errors made with the masters years ago at original licensor Software Sculptors. The error could only be fixed by completely remastering the series audio, which would've driven up the price of this set considerably. The Japanese voice track is in stereo, fortunately.

For animation fans, you may see the first series and be astounded by its relatively poor quality given its production year. This was in large part due to what a risky and unusual series Slayers was. Lina broke the mold of anime heroines in the 90s and paved the way for the much stronger and livelier female characters that have thrived in anime since then. In the sequel series Next and Try, where it's taken off as a hit, the animation turns into some of the best you'll see from the pre-crash mid-90s.

In all, a very good investment and a great way to remind yourself of plot points if you're interested in the Slayers Revolution and Evolution-R sets that FUNimation just released.",1275436800,,1403,4.695121951219512

Now about the show and why I love it! First it's Lina she's my favorite female anime character of all time. She's funny, tough, has a backbone and at the end of the day has a good heart and truly loves her friends.
All of the Slayers series is classic dub in everyway everyone does such a wonderful job with their character, Lisa is Lina she has pure talent. Also I'm a huge dub fan but I actually like watching this in Japanese as well. Now the three series 'Slayers' is where we meet everybody and it's a fun ride. 'Slayers Try' the third season is fun as well.
But the true favorite of mine and the season that stands out and makes this special is 'Slayers Next' the second season. The story, the new characters, the sweetness the love just makes me happy to be a Anime fan! ^_^ By the end of Slayers Next I was close to tears and I actually cheered! So Slayers Next wins the Gold in pure fun and just being an around great series! If you're looking for some classic anime (Old School! hehe) with some of the best funniest characters.

3896188,4,B002BWD764,"[I'm not going to waste time here summarizing the anime (if you're that curious, wiki it) or reviewing the anime itself -there are plenty of other reviews that do that. ]

To start, the casing itself, while pretty, has a rather flimsy, thin cardboard outside cover [if you like to take care of your anime, you'll have to be careful with this one -no leaving out in the sunlight or cramming it into a tight shelf space] and far more annoyingly the DvD's are held in such a way inside the set that you have to remove the last two DvDs to read the episode guide on the back inside cover.  This feels like something that could have easily been avoided.  The art on the Dvd's is nothing special; no real connective theme or artistic style, just the faces of various Slayer's characters  [I would have actually really liked to have seen the eye-catches used in the series as DvD art!].  As far as special features go there isn't much - mostly art gallery stuff and trailers for other shows, with the occasional AMV thrown in.

BUT WHO CARES.  Because quite frankly, for three substantially sized seasons of such a fun, classic anime, this is an amazing price - even for just the convenience of having the series take up a little less shelf space.  The video and sound quality is also excellent, rough animation of the earlier episodes aside.

My only real warning for this boxset is that, considering that a fourth season is about to be released, it may just be worth a bit of a wait to see if they'll be releasing a more complete boxset in the future, though I doubt you will find it at this good a price.

I can easily remember watching  ""The Slayers"" when it first appeared on television in Japan, catching the premiere of the series at an anime convention and watching the main Japanese voice actress Megumi Hayashibara promoting the series in America and singing a song from the series.  And then the release of  the series on VHS and owning multiple copies just to get a subtitled and English dubbed version because I enjoyed the series that much.

It's hard to believe but nearly 14 years later since ""The Slayers"" debut as a light novel by Hajime Kanzaka and Rui Araizumi (which the duo has since released 50 light novels), the series has received a manga treatment, two OAV series, five movies, countless video games and for anime series, there have been a total of five.

With the series having had its release in the US from Software Sculptors and Central Park Media, the series is now receiving its first major collection with ""The Slayers: The First Three Seasons"" which consists of Season One: The Slayers (April 1995-Sept. 1995, 26 episodes), Season Two:  Slayers Next (April 1996-Sept. 1996, 26 episodes) and Season Three: Slayers Try (April 1997-Sept. 1997, 26 episodes) for a total of 78 episodes included in this collection.

All three series were directed by Takashi Watanabe (""Casshan: Robot Hunter"", ""Y's II"", ""New Fist of the North Star"", ""Ikki Tousen""), screenplay by Takao Koyama (""Dragon Ball Z"", ""Saint Seiya"", ""Urusei Yatsura"", ""Zillion""), character designs by Naomi Miyata (""Kino's Journey"", ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"", ""Sakura Wars"") and music by Osamu Tezuka (""Shadow Skill"", ""Popotan"", ""Lost Universe, ""Akazukin Cha Cha"").

The series revolves around the character of Lina Inverse, a powerful sorceress who has a love for money and eating a lot of food.  Everytime she tries to help a village (for money), somehow, she ends up destroying it and thus, has a reputation of being a destructive and evil sorceress.  During each season, she is accompanied by Gourry Gabriev, Zelgadis Greyswords and Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun during her adventures for more money, food and fun.

The main characters of ""Slayers"" (for each of the three seasons) are:

Lina Inverse - A powerful sorceress who loves money and food.  She is very sensitive when she's around other women that are more bustier than her and tends to have a short fuse.  Whenever she's in battle, her spells tend to do more damage than she thinks.  But because of the sheer amount of destruction that she's caused, the rumors have spread throughout the country and people tend to fear her and make her out as an evil person when she's not.

Gourry Gabriev - The marvelous swordsman who wields the sword of light.  He also has a bad memory and is a powerful magic wielder but doesn't remember being one.  So, he joins Lina on her adventures as her personal bodyguard.

Zelgadis Greywords - A powerful sorcerer who is a chimera made of a rock golemn courtesy of his ancestor Rizo.  Known for his green face and purple, wiry hair and is half demon and human.  He looks desperately for a stone that will change him to a human, even if it means losing his chimera powers.  A stoic, no-nonsense character.

Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun - A young miko and also a princess.  Her dream is becoming a hero of justice and thus, joins Lina and Gourry.  Very naive at times and believes almost everything that people tend to tell her.

Supporting characters that appear in other seasons are:

Xellos - Joins Lina and friends in the second season of ""Slayers Next"".  A high level Mazoku and a priest of the ""Greater Beast Zelas-Metallium"".  Also known as Beastmaster Xellos.

Filia - A priestess of the Fire Kingdom who wanted Luna to accompany her in her quest but hires Lina and her friends to join her.  Appear in the third season of ""Slayers Try"".

VIDEO & AUDIO:

It's important to note that Slayers debuted on Japanese television back in 1995, so for those who just started watching anime or are interested in the older series after watching ""Slayers Revolution"" or ""Slayers Evolution-R"", there is a big difference in the quality of anime and the overall sharpness and vibrancy of the colors.  But as an anime series that came out in 1995, the series was on par of what we were used to seeing from anime series around that time (""Dragon Ball GT"", ""Blue Seed"", ""Sailor Moon Super S"", etc.)  The series is featured in 4:3 and when I was younger and watching this series, I felt that the animation was very good for a television series.  I also enjoyed the overall painted background settings of the series.

Of course, comparing this 1995-1997 series with the 2008-2009 series is almost like comparing to apples to oranges but considering the time period this anime series was released,  I enjoyed the comedic play of serious to humorous character designs and of course was more cel driven and doesn't utilize the 3D CG that we see in today's ""Slayers"" anime series.  Also, unlike the recent FUNimation Entertainment releases of ""Dragon Ball Z"" or ""Dragon Ball GT"" which has received major digital remastering and restoration, this series doesn't and so it does show its age and at times you will see picture quality a bit faded at times.

As for audio, this series retains its Central Park Anime English dub, so for fans of the classic series, Lisa Ortiz and Eric Stuart fans should be happy to know that FUNimation Entertainment retained the original talent.  As mentioned earlier, when the VHS first came out, I was purchasing both the Japanese and English VHS versions, because I'm a big fan of Megumi Hayashibara's vocal work and was one of the first series (not from Pioneer) in which I enjoyed both the English and Japanese voice talent at the same time.  Both vocal tracks are in Dolby Digital stereo and subtitles are in English only.

I preferred to watch the series with my audio receiver set for ""Stereo on All Channels"" for a more immersive soundscape.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Slayers: The First Three Seasons"" contain the textless songs and FUNimation Entertainment trailers for each season on the fourth disc.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Slayers"" will always be an anime series that I will always enjoy.  I was heavily into the series back in the 90's and I know there had been this lull of when I didn't catch anything related to the series but just a few related films.  But watching this series again, definitely brought back memories of catching the series at an anime con meeting, an anime convention, buying multiple versions to get the subtitled and English dubbed versions.  I really enjoyed this series.

But it takes some dedication.  Where a long anime series such as ""Dragon Ball Z"" can have a conclusion, the fact that this series has literally been on television or released in some format for the last 15 years, you really have to be a dedicated fan to following a series this long. In fact, each season is a story arc in itself but for the most part, they are stand-alone episodes and typically the final three or four episodes is where everything tends to lead to a major battle. And despite these episodes being over a decade old, the anime still holds up today.  And the fact that you can own all three seasons in a single box set for a great price is also another incentive.

For those who are wondering how the packaging is done for this box set which has 12 DVD's, you get a slipcover but then almost in like a large digibook format, instead of pages you get six plastic sections where two DVD's fit into.  Episode titles are on the inside front and rear covers.

Overall, there's nothing bad I can say about this series. You're getting 78 classic episodes and to imagine back then, it took forever for these episodes to come out in the US let alone having to wait for each season to come out on DVD.  So, personally, I think it's a great service for anime fans that FUNimation Entertainment has released ""The Slayers: The First Three Seasons"" on one set and are dedicated to releasing the newer seasons in the US as well.

Fans of ""Slayers"", this box set is definitely recommended for old school anime fans and those who simply enjoy the ""Slayers"" series!",1256601600,31,20623,4.47016129032258
3896192,4,B002BWD764,"I currently own the 3 seasons of Slayers as separate box sets, also bought on Amazon.com. I do like them a lot but the actual boxes are kind of thin and a bit flimsy. Also season one has a slip cover while the other 2 do not. You might not find that as annoying as I do, but to each his own.
I was slightly interested in owning all the sets as one entity, but because the picture on Amazon.com doesn't really show the condition of the actual box I went to my local Best Buy to check it out. For those interested it is still made of flimsy, thin cardboard. To be honest I would much rather have all 3 seasons separate now that I've seen this one. It seems cool at first to have them all there in one box, but from what I could tell there was no separation of the seasons, except for what's printed on the discs themselves.
I've also had some experience with box sets like these before, and they tend to fall apart on me, after some time, due to the larger size of them and the thin-ness of the outer casing that's holding all of it. I would suggest getting the sets separately, like I have, unless you really like having everything in one place. It might cost a bit more but I think it's worth it because the smaller, separate sets will have a better chance of lasting longer.
I'd give 5 stars because I think the series rocks, but this particular box set could have been made better, so 4 stars it is.",1255046400,4,1401,4.135531135531136
3896193,3,B002BWD764,"Somehow in my weird and wacky anime history, I've unintentionally avoided The Slayers and its storied franchise history entirely.  Despite frequent whispers of its lighthearted and enjoyable nature, it always seemed like there was something more pressing or pertinent to force The Slayers to the proverbial backburner. Fortunately Funimation has individuals like me in mind with their latest release of the property: The Slayers - The First Three Seasons collection.

Coming in at a whopping total runtime of 1725 minutes, this box set spans 12 discs packaged in a ""book"" of clear thin packs housed in an attractive cardboard outer slipcase.

The show wears an appropriate, if not slightly conservative TV PG (13+) rating due to animated and often silly violence over the real rough stuff such as nudity or adult language.  Language options include both the original Japanese dialog track or an English dub (each in stereo) and the option of running English subtitles with either.

Special features are non-existent but considering how much actual material is presented within this set, it's quite forgivable.  Speaking of the material contained, this collection lives up to its name by including the first three seasons of the show in their entirety.  Each season consists of 26 episodes (4 discs apiece) and are labeled as followed: Season One: The Slayers, Season Two: Slayers Next, and Season Three: Slayers Try.

The story, in an intense effort to summarize, goes something like this:  The infamous and ultra-powerful sorceress, Lina Inverse encounters the brave (but incompetent) Gourry Gabriev who, due to her lack of pubescent development, mistakes her for a foolish little girl in distress.  The unlikely duo end up teaming up in a world riddled with crime and corruption in effort to find a way to make a little loot in the process of cleaning up society.

The show, for anyone yet to experience it, can best be described as a fantasy romp (think magic, dragons, treasure, and bandits) with a strong sense of humor, and a splash of Dragon Ball Z thrown in for good measure.  Don't let that last one throw you; it's meant in the best sense of the comparison.  Fighting (spell casting) occupies much of the story development and like many shows of the era, works pretty well as a catalyst to move our heroes from town to town.  Villains are frequent and come in many forms only unlike most shonen do-gooder themed anime titles out there, part of the fun in The Slayers is to root for the bad guys since technically they're the good guys.  Old Lina and Gourry aren't above robbing from a group of bandits in effort to support their insatiable appetite for food (triple servings please), or ridding a village of a pesky black dragon but only if the price for their service is right.

The dynamic between the lead characters is strong enough to warrant the voyage thanks to witty dialog that succeeds in both language options.  The ragtag group of rogues (which later expands to include members Zelgadis and Amelia) find their path laced with opportunities to administer their unique brand of justice around every corner.

Pacing is swift and efficient with episodes that neither drag by nor end suddenly or incompletely.  The show doesn't follow typical serial format, which means that each episode was written to stand on its own (with references to past events strewn about).  Basically it's pretty easy to pick up on the show at any point and follow along without much explaining.

The visuals look a bit faded and choppily animated when compared to the computer-generated imaging of today's anime titles but, and again I have to compare it to DBZ, the show has aged quite well for its vintage (the first season aired back in 1995).  There is little in terms of the visuals to differentiate the three seasons from one another save for the opening sequence, which was unique to each.  On the whole it appears that the show gradually began to take itself a bit more seriously as time went on.  While the first season especially seemed to revel in near-constant stabs at humor (including Lina's penchant for sarcastically talking to herself), the chemistry of the characters as they played off one another definitely became less forced in the later seasons.

Sound work is adequate in all regards with little to get overly excited about.  The English dub is only slightly less enthusiastic as the original Japanese vocal work; again a testament to quality that was quite ahead of its time.

While I could spend limitless server space talking about the show itself, the real show stopper comes in the form of the packaging/ presentation value Funimation packed into this collection.  This 12-disc set is absolutely gorgeous with its double-disc thin packs linked together and bound in what looks like a spell book taken directly from the show.  Within this ""book"" are the complete episode listings for all three seasons (half of the second and all of the third are only visible by removing the two-dvds and looking through the clear plastic on the last page), written in fancy scroll on intentionally yellowed parchment.  This entire book then slides into the outer cardboard sleeve that is pictured and the whole affair takes up a little less room on the shelf than three standard dvd cases.

In conclusion, The Slayers is a fine example of a special time in the history of Japanese animation where everything hadn't been done a hundred times over and writers were free to enjoy the process of story telling by not falling into the trap of taking themselves too seriously.  If the show's unique character isn't enough to justify giving it a go during your next anime binge, perhaps the packaging (which is truly top notch) and the sheer entertainment value contained within (we are talking about 29 hours worth of anime here) will be.",1249344000,63,5840,4.909460834181078

The box itself is honestly not as luxurious as it looks. It's mostly made of a gift card like paper with a six page plastic DVD holder that holds a total 12 disks. Regardless of whether you're a collector or not, you'll have to take extra care of this case. Personally this case doesn't annoy me enough too deduct a point, because I only care the actual video quality of the DVDs.

The video seems to be right from the source with zero enhancements, which is fantastic. It's in a 4:3 ratio with that classic cel animation look.

The Japanese audio is better than the English audio (big surprise, I know), the main reason is because the Japanese audio is in true stereo whereas the English audio is in mono. This is extremely noticeable with the opening theme. So if you plan on watching this in English and care about good audio, well now you know.

As for the subtitles, from what little I've actually looked at, I would say they are passable. Honestly, if you care about good subs, just learn the language already so you no longer have to.",1518134400,2,1315,4.290322580645161
