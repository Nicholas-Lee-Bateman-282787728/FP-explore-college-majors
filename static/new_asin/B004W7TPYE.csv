8444739,5,B004W7TPYE,"I ordered this mainly for Carrie, which I had an old edition of and I wanted to replace with the special edition. And then I saw this item, which I wanted to get for two reasons: To get the special edition of Carrie and to get the special edition of Child's Play, which I bought a while ago in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo set. All of the editions are the special editions, which separately cost much more than this set. So if you want the special editions of these movies, this set is more affordable and worth a buy.",1413417600,,509,4.204081632653061
