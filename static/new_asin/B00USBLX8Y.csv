7070726,4,B00USBLX8Y,"Can't explain why I love this pretty corny movie, but I do. Must be because I spent my formative 20's in the 80's. Oh, and it does have a stellar cast. A little embarrassing, but I'm not apologizing!",1473984000,,199,4.2631578947368425
7070727,5,B00USBLX8Y,Hard to believe that you can see what happens in this movie has happened in real life. You need to pay good attention to the main characters otherwise you get lost. Very good performance of Patrick Swayze.,1468800000,,205,4.5675675675675675

7070729,5,B00USBLX8Y,"I absolutely love this movie. If you have not seen the reboot, I highly recommend viewing this one first. It has great acting by giants such as Swayze and Sheen and a powerful story line to go along with it. Although the threat was more relevant when it first was released, however the thrill is still the same. This would make an excellent movie night when followed by its reboot staring Josh Peck and Chris Hemsworth. Even though they are basically the same movie, they have more than enough differences and drama to warrant watching them successively. 10/10 would recommend.",1464652800,2,577,4.78

The disk plays well buy the case was not the red displayed by the sell so that was disappointing.  there was also a small crack in the bottom of the case, very small and does not hender the useage of the case.

7070773,5,B00USBLX8Y,"Great classic movie. This original is alot better than the remake. The original has a much better story line, better actors, and isn't full of special effects that todays movies have to have. This movie was made when actors, and there level of acting ability is what made a movie! Not the special effects that mask the ""actors"" ""acting"" like the newer released rendition.
Charlie Sheen is one of those actors, when his name is in the credits, you know you are in for some great acting. This movie is an action movie, well there are several levels and dimentions to this story, and the acting line up brings it! Stories, and movies like this are far and very few inbetween these days. One of the all time greatest movies ever!!!",1517616000,,727,4.557251908396947

7070792,3,B00USBLX8Y,"Red Dawn, 1984 film

The movie begins with news of political revolts in Europe and South America! What will happen to America? We see a small city. In September leaves are turning color and falling. [Symbolism?] There is a statue to the Rough Riders [the last Volunteer Corps in the US Army]. A teacher talks about the history of the Huns. Outside they see parachutes falling! The teacher goes outside and is shot dead! Automobiles crash in the parking lot! [Is this believable?] Teenage students grab supplies (food, arms, and ammunition) and head off to the woods. Can this well-regulated militia resist a professional army? [Refer to Europe in WW II.] These invader speak Spanish. They will gather Form 4473s to identify all owners of firearms in order to confiscate them. Never shoot twice as this allows the enemy to locate you.

The boys shoot a deer for meat and open cans of food. [Product placement?] When they run short they go into town. They notice changes. The KGB are looking for you! A lot of people were taken away to re-education centers. Its all gone says one man. You cant afford to cry. Go away before they find you. They learn about Free America. [Canned goods in glass should be on high shelves in case they fall.] One couple offers shelter and food. Horses don't need oil and gasoline. Radio Free America sends messages and songs. Things are different now. An enemy patrol runs into trouble, arrows and bullets. Citizens dig graves then are machine gunned. The resistance has captured AK-47s now. A girl delivers a package to a tank crew. The resistance attacks enemy troops, and leave a message. [Is the wolverine a state animal?]

There is an explosion in a club. [How different from terrorists?] One American pilot parachutes down and joins their group. He tells them what happened. Illegal immigrants were disguised combatants. They won't use nuclear weapons now. He tells them who is on out side! [There is a surprise.] Millions are starving. Snow falls. The Colonel gives lessons in military tactics. Whats a flank? There are attacks. The enemy is their supply line. An enemy tank approaches. There are casualties. More enemy troops arrive. A hunter can kill wolverines. The fighting goes on. One member is accused of treason. Will the good guys win in the end?

This is an exciting and colorful story for teenagers of all ages. Wars are waged for loot [land, people, oil or coal, etc.]. What does this small town have to offer except as an example that doesnt seem realistic? Many of the examples seem to be derived from WW II in Europe. [Do you know what happened when US forced were sent to Central American Banana Republics or the Philippines a century ago? This is a dramatic story, but I don't think this will ever happen. [Im an optimist, aren't you?] Could a few city teenagers do so well? They didn't play The Eve of Destruction at all.",1503187200,,2874,4.730538922155689

For completists - the version I got had a regular blue style case, not the red case in the picture.  The artwork is red, but the case is blue.  I didn't care about that as I put the jacket and blu-ray into a 3-disc case so I could add my 2-disc dvd and have a 3-disc edition.

The first time I received a Blu-ray case that wasn't like the one in the picture (it was blue) the label was the only red part. I watched the film (one of my favorites) and halfway through it froze and refused to function in multiple players. I ordered it again and this time I got the full red case and the disc functions.

8708024,3,B00USBLX8Y,"A slow and too patriotic take on a Russian invasion.

Red Dawn is a fun, but overly long war film. It takes on the 1980's style camp tone with one note communist villains. You are engaged by Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey, but no one else. However, Harry Dean Stanton delivers a neat monologue towards the beginning. Red Dawn tries too hard to be democratic and ends up feeling like propaganda.

Red Dawn is worth a single watch for that fun and creative '80's vibe wherein children can take on the entire Russian army. If you can suspend your disbelief, you'll have a good time. Otherwise, it becomes tedious and unbelievable with each new situation. At least, there are consequences eventually.

Red Dawn is a piece of American cinema history and an enjoyable bit of culture; however, it is rife with cliches and stereotypes. I wish it were better, but Red Dawn is not one of the best war films ever shot.",1528761600,,957,4.650887573964497
8708025,4,B00USBLX8Y,"Amazing movie. Dont even watch the remake just watch this. But I gave it 4 stars because it came in a blue case, not the red as shown.
