8520175,5,B007P6IV12,"This DVD is a jewel.  As a yoga instructor, I'm often drawn to different kinds of movement practices and I wanted to try Tai Chi.  Although I attended a few Tai Chi classes offered in our community, ""dropping -in"" did not allow for this beginner to keep up.  I decided a home practice would prove more satisfying and ordered Sulam Chi: Integrating the Energies of Tai Chi by Levi Ben-Shmuel.  This practice is beautiful and accessible.  Levi exquisitely introduces the Ladder of Life then proceeds to demonstrate Tai Chi movement in a rich and accessible flow.  The more I watch and do the practice, listening to Levi's guidance and insights, this dvd continues to keep me inspired and gently progress at my own pace.",1431302400,,717,4.741935483870968

8520177,5,B007P6IV12,"The Sulam Chi DVD is magnificent! When I watch it, I am transported
into a peaceful, uplifting, openhearted space. I love watching it. It
is a simple, yet powerful way to align with the life force, with
Divine energy.

Levi is clearly a master teacher with exceptional expertise in Tai Chi
and Kabbalah. His teaching and instruction are clear and very easy to
follow and connect with. If you are interested in Kabbalah, you will
learn and experience it in a way that is pure and accessible. The
amazing thing about this DVD is that you can learn the practice well
with it. Regardless of what spiritual and or healing path one might be
on, Sulam Chi is a powerful vehicle to help one grow, connect with the
Divine, and live an openhearted life.",1336003200,2,743,4.544776119402985
