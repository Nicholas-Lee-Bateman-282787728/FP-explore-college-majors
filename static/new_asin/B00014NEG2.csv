8006478,5,B00014NEG2,"I must say after reading the other reviews, I don't think most people have really seen very many UFO documentaries other than what they see on television. Also, I don't waist my time writing reviews about films I don't like, I simply don't have the time. Don't believe what the skeptics say. This film presents Stanton Friedman at his best. I purchased this 2-DVD set because I wanted to replace a VHS copy I have so I am well acquainted with this product. I have collected virtually 300 UFO documentaries over the last 20 years and when I look through my collection, this DVD set ""Flying Saucers Are Real Part 1 & 2"" is bar none, one of the top 10 most important films to see dealing with UFOs and ET contact. Everyone has their favorites but if I was teaching this subject at a college or university, I would rate this 2-DVD set as one of the most important films to see on the UFO phenomenon. The evidence presented here is solid and stands up in the face of the skeptics. Included in this 2-DVD set is the details of how Stanton Friedman and his colleagues using the court system evoked the freedom of information act to request government documents dealing with UFOs. You will see the documents they received including documents that were blacked out do to issues of national security. This DVD product is perfect to recommend to friends.",1242518400,7,1343,4.553719008264463
8006479,5,B00014NEG2,"I bought this DVD because I thought it would be an update to the original one done in 1978.  There is very little in the way of new information, no stunning visual eye candy.  Just Stanton telling it like it is.  I really enjoyed listening to him because he reminds of some collge professor going off on tangents about something.  There was some additional information about Roswell I never heard before involving the newspapers and the mortician.  Not going to spoil it for you, see it for yourself.  The thing is Stanton is very low key and doesn't hype the issue.  He keeps it very factual, almost matter of factual.  Remember this guy has been doing this for thirty plus years.  He has spent a lot of time trying to pry open the files and release this information to the planet.  Personally I enjoyed it and would watch it again.  Highly recommend either purchasing for your UFO DVD/VHS collection or renting for your own personal knowledge.",1241222400,2,945,4.632530120481928
8006480,1,B00014NEG2,"Save your money. This is an over priced poorly made production.  Nothing new here and more suprisingly no interesting video footage.  Just hours of Stanton Friedman looking into the camera and re-hashing stories we have all heard time and time again. Try the Unsolved Mysteries UFO set. It is a winner, but leave this one alone.  It's horrible.",1172361600,9,344,4.896551724137931
8006481,3,B00014NEG2,"Because I was led to believe there was a connection (via the IMDB/Amazon link), I essentially bought this double-DVD to replace my worn-out VHS copy of ""UFOs Are Real"", a much-better-than-it-deserved-to-be documentary about UFOs from the late-70s (that Stanton Friedman was also involved with). Thinking that this DVD would simply be an updated edition, little did I realize upon watching it that, in fact, it wasn't at all! Much of the documentary footage involves Dr. Friedman merely standing in front of retired rockets at the NASA visitors' center and delivering a report on UFO information gleaned to date (the late 90s).

Okay, I'll admit that Friedman's information was interesting enough, yet there was really precious little footage from other sources, particularly from ""UFOs Are Real"" of which there couldn't have been more than 6 or 7 minutes worth. To be honest, that old documentary is more interesting and thorough and, despite its paltry production budget, it DOES include in-depth interviews with Betty Hill, Travis Walton and several people involved with the Roswell incident, as well as a wealth of UFO photography and movie-footage up to that point in time.

Though Friedman does address more current UFO issues in ""Flying Saucers Are Real"" (e.g., the Majestic Project documentation, his attempt to obtain UFO-related documents via the Freedom of Information Act, and his debunking of the alien autopsy film), there still isn't a great deal of footage beyond Friedman's ad-libbing in front of an old Saturn V rocket lying on its side. And much of the non-Friedman footage is repeated, sometimes two or three times, throughout the documentary--if I saw the Las Vegas TV news report on Area 51 one more time, I would have screamed. Honestly, you're probably better off trying to find an old VHS copy of ""UFOs Are Real"" if you still can.",1117497600,30,1854,5.095394736842105
