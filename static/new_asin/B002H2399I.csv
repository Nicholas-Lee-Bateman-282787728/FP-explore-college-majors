The film centers around a film director, newly famous, who has been asked to serve as a judge for a film festival in Seoul. This turns out to be the least important element of the film, which seems to be about smoking and getting drunk, with the occasional sex act to try to make it more interesting.

It didn't work...

If you want to see it anyway, you can get your DVD in either Region 1 or 3 format from Amazon.com",1335139200,,613,4.359649122807017
