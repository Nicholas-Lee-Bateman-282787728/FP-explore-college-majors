Does the predictable and really improbable series of hostage taking on both. With the intelligence of a seventh grader both would have escaped numerous opportune times.
So, people escape numerous times but still seem to get caught soon after.
A few cheap torture props that a small budget and a smaller imagination would allow.

Ending spoiler (well not really because this ending has been used many times).
There's room for a ""Spoiler 2"". Help!",1392249600,,568,4.916666666666667
6097380,4,B00GOYC3S8,"Prior to watching SCORNED, I checked out its IMDB page and was quite surprised to discover the director was the same guy that did LEPRECHAUN way back in the early 90s.  I immediately began to wonder if I was making a mistake by watching this new film; after all, LEPRECHAUN is about as schlocky as you can get.  But I knew I had to give the film a chance; the plot sounded solid, and I was definitely intrigued.  Thankfully, my fears were unfounded; SCORNED is a lot of fun and definitely worth watching.

I will confess that SCORNED is not an excellent movie, but it is still very good.  I recommend giving it a shot, however it won't be for everyone.  It would certainly make a great PSA for staying faithful to your spouse!

SCORNED is shot well and looks good onscreen overall.  I particularly like the set of the house in which the drama unfolds.  It is a hilltop estate that is nothing short of amazing.  This makes a fitting backdrop for the vengeance that Sadie unleashes.

The acting is good, although Billy Zane and Viva Bianca are kept drugged so much that they really don't get much time to actually perform.  This still works well, though, and lets Annalynne McCords character get downright vicious.  Some of the things she puts these two through will make you cringe.

Yet, that is part of the downside to this film for me.  Sadie is definitely crazyhowever the tortures that she inflicts upon the cheating pair aren't really as gruesomely depicted as I was hoping.  Or maybe its the fact that the special effects team didn't get very liberal with the blood.  Theres just something missing, some spark of insanity that should set the film off.

But a solid story keeps SCORNED on the right track.  The ending made me smile, and I feel it certainly does justice to the movie as a whole.  I just hope they don't ruin this one by making a sequel.

SCORNED is an entertaining movie, and I suggesting giving it a look.  Even if youve never cheated or been cheated on, this film will make those who are considering doing it reconsider.  You never know how crazy the person you're with isso be warned!  SCORNED is available today in a variety of formats.",1391472000,,2161,4.524547803617571

6097387,5,B00GOYC3S8,"Twisted movie of revenge.  Don't mess with a scorned lady.  She can become a psycho.  In this case, she does.",1433894400,,109,4.35
6097388,4,B00GOYC3S8,it ok as far as revenge movies go,1426982400,,33,3.25
6097389,4,B00GOYC3S8,"Let me begin by saying that this movie belonged to Annalynne McCord.  She is basically in all of the scenes, and in just about every scene she is the center of the action.  Her actions drive the plot.  Billy Zane is good here, as he is in just about any movie that he's in.  Viva Bianca is fine.  I have always been a fan of hers since watching ""Spartacus"".

So, what are the highlights of this movie?  Well, it's not the plot.  If I were to rate this on plot alone, it would not get four stars.  The best parts of this movie are the two gorgeous females and Annalynne's delightful performance.  Look, it is hard not to like a movie when Annalynne McCord and Viva Bianca are in it.  These are just two very beautiful, very talented actresses.

Annalynne's portrayal of a scorned girlfriend, who happens to have a history of mental illness, is just fun to watch.  Her southern accent is very, very charming.  Yes, her Sadie is a dangerous psycho, but she is also very sexy and very funny.  Sadie has a beautiful, athletic body and a mouth that spews forth endless lines of southern wit.  I would imagine that Annalynne had fun playing this role.  She had some cute lines here.

Billy Zane plays the cheating boyfriend, Kevin.  Viva plays Jennifer, the other woman in Kevin's life.  And, Sadie's best friend.  Yeah, pretty screwed up, right?  It gets even better when the party that got betrayed is not exactly normal, in terms of emotional stability.  You can expect a reaction that's not exactly normal.  And that is what we've got here.  A scorned southern peach.

Watch this movie to see Annalynne at the top of her acting game.  Watch this movie to see Annalynne running around in her panties.  Watch this to see Viva Bianca in her undies.  Although, honestly, you will get to see more of her charms in ""Spartacus"" than what she shows here.  I love Annalynne's southern accent.  But I also love Viva's sexy voice.  If you pay attention during one of their scenes, you will hear the vivid contrast between their voices.

Highly recommended!",1424563200,4,2042,4.552486187845304

6097406,2,B00GOYC3S8,"Where to begin? The movie felt contrived and like it didn't even care enough to take itself seriously. The story line is so 'been there done that' and doesn't even try to inject a sense of the novel. The dialogue is lame. Like, who uses the word 'scorned' anymore? And who uses it multiple times in one night? The antagonist is sooo one note. She has the same inflections, mannerisms (verbal and otherwise), the same relentless, verbal diarrhea approach to any scene (the other 2 characters are either drugged, knocked out, or whatever much of the time, but man, she just doesn't stop talking! Maybe the writers, director, don't know what mania really looks like: its not the same as a motormouth), and the same persistently grating chipper attitude with a twist of (faux) ""I'm sincere, donchaknow?"" I kept watching, hoping that something would flip and make it more interesting but nope. Never happened. A real waste of money and time.",1398038400,6,936,4.819875776397516

6097409,2,B00GOYC3S8,"Annalynne McCord is great in this movie. She's an awesome actress and always shows it. So it's like Annalynne had to act in a parallel universe to Scorned, a truly crummy film. She defeated terrible writing and directing to come out on top. I'm really disappointed in Billy Zane. He and the female supporting actress fell flat as if they were half asleep. I wouldn't recommend the movie, but check out Annalynne in Excision or her other movie, video and TV appearances.",1395964800,,469,4.7317073170731705
6097410,5,B00GOYC3S8,This is a typical psycho-thriller movie  the reason I gave it a high rating is because I really enjoyed seeing my hometown on the big screen  nothing special but still a pretty good watch.,1395273600,,188,4.5
6097411,5,B00GOYC3S8,"Very good movie, filmed in beautiful southern Ohio, very suspenseful and intense. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat.",1393804800,,132,4.782608695652174
6097412,1,B00GOYC3S8,"I figured I was in trouble when our lead -- Sadie, played by Annalynne McCord (who is basically reprising a version of the role she did with a lot more skill in EXCISION) -- awkwardly used the word ""scorned"" for the sixth time in her dialogue. ""You SCORNED me, Kevin!"" she cries at least four times. ""Hell hath no fury like a woman SCORNED!"" she announces, just in case anyone didn't get it.

The story is your basic love triangle, with Kevin cheating on Sadie (as in ""sadie-istic"") with her best friend, Jennifer (Viva Bianca wearing one of the worst wigs I've ever seen). Sadie finds out and completely loses what little of her mind she had. The rest is torture, maiming, and lots of crazy-eyed stares and pointless monologues about forgiveness and the like.

There are a lot of problems here. First of all, like most movies of this ilk, it can't tell if it wants to be horrifying or funny, and so it tries to do a little of both. I'm starting to think the horror-comedy aspiration is a lost cause, because it is so rarely ever done well, and this is very much the case here. If it's NOT trying to be funny, then that makes this a whole lot worse, because there's a lot here to laugh about.

A big problem is that the movie thrusts us directly into the torture and maiming. It gives viewers almost no back story at all, except in a few ill-timed and poorly written flashbacks, so it's impossible to care about any of the characters at all, even more so since none of them have any depth. Kevin: rich sleazeball. Jennifer: mistress. Sadie: crazy woman. Seriously. The end.

Piled on top of this turd souffle are so many technical issues, it's hard to know where to begin. The acting is laughable; Billy Zane appears to have just given up. Our victims don't appear ever to fight back at all or in any logical, reasonable way, so the suspense and torture is more baffling than horrifying. The editing is, just, wow, just a masterful cocktail of incompetence. There are at least three scenes where meaningless shots were obviously cobbled together just to patch up a plot hole. And, the piece de resistance, the soundtrack features multiple shrill songs that sound like they were recorded for a My First Slumber Party CD. Turns out the director/writer (who is best known for the LEPRECHAUN series) wrote some of these songs. I didn't recognize the name of the woman who sang them, but she had a bit part in the movie, and I have no doubt she's either related to or dating one of the producers, since she had all of the musical skill of a goose with throat polyps.

A story that goes nowhere and does it with a complete lack of skill, this is one for the trash heaps.",1393632000,5,2664,4.462012320328542
6097413,1,B00GOYC3S8,"The only smart person in the movie is the ""scorned"" woman. The victims and even the cops are stupid.  If you like the kind of movie where you yell at the victims and say how stupid they are, then this is for you. Any rational person would have escaped. Not a suspense movie but a poorly scripted chain of events.",1393632000,2,312,4.2
6097414,2,B00GOYC3S8,"A strange twist to the woman scorned plot we all know so well.....not worth $3.99, wait for it to come to ""Lifetime' since that's the best place for this predictable movie with a wicked twist.......",1393545600,2,198,4.685714285714286

Well, that  can trigger a person into doing some vicious things to try and feel better from the low blow she just got hit with. Annalynne McCord is so freaking crazy and fun to watch. She cracks me up too. And in the movie Excision or Incision, (I think is the name) she was obsessed with being a Dr. and blood and it was sooooooooooooooooo crazzzzyyyy and sick, that I just loved it.

6097417,4,B00GOYC3S8,"This movie has a fantastic beginning and an amazing ending but the middle could use some improvement.  The woman who plays the psychopath is incredible; really believable as a nut job!!  But here in lies the problem.  Even though the film is really intense and gory after awhile it becomes boring to watch these two poor people being tormented and it's difficult to watch as well so have a strong stomach or skip this film. I think the movie would have been better served to have started earlier on perhaps even in her childhood instead of just with flashbacks and definitely in her relationship while it was still good instead of circling the entire film around her revenge. For instance, you take a stunner like Fatal Attraction; more than half the fascination is watching this seemingly normal woman turn more and more crazed! Nonetheless if you enjoy watching a hot, SIC woman torture the hell out of everyone, this is just what the doctor ordered. I think I actually dozed off through some of the middle; even torture becomes dull if overplayed and unfortunately this was.  However, I gave this film four stars because the lead actress really made it interesting; she worked the script for all it's worth and then some.  And if you think Glen Close was evil at the end of Fatal Attraction YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING YET!!  I AM NOW ADDING SOMETHING AT A LATER DATE; WHILE CLEANING THE HOUSE I STUCK THIS FILM ON AND REMARKABLY AT THE FIRST GO AROUND I MISSED A WHOLE SCENE WHERE THE ""BEST FRIEND"" IS IN THE CAR WITH WHACK JOB AND SHE PRETENDS THAT THE REASON FOR EVERYTHING IS BECAUSE SHE IS ACTUALLY IN LOVE WITH HER!  This was an incredible strategy to save her own skin and they kissed intimately across the seats so it seemed to be working but for some ludicrous reason right when she was finding a way out she stopped the love story, why??",1392940800,,1849,4.551204819277109
6097418,4,B00GOYC3S8,The movie played out quickly with just enough back story to keep my interest.
