8433568,1,B004KWVE3G,"I bought this DVD for my daughter and OH, boy! was I embarrassed, not only the actual workout is lame but the music combined with the street looking set with garbage cans, girls with tough look a like clothing? and the electronic echo voice that is giving the instructions was unbearable to even finish the want to be cool dace moves workout. After 10 minutes my daughter said ""make it stop, please"" I did. lol. Save your money and most importantly save yourself from embarrassment. I'm known to be the cool mom but this have question my ""cool"". Thank goodness I have a forgiving teenager. The DVD was donated to Salvation Army, sorry. ",1390953600,8,636,4.628318584070796
8433569,5,B004KWVE3G,I prefer kid's workouts over adult ones because they are usually the length I want and non-sexual!  The girls are dressed modestly and it's a great workout!,1389225600,5,156,4.777777777777778
