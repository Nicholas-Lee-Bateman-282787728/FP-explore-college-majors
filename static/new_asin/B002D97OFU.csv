3910015,5,B002D97OFU,"Let's say you want to either prove or disprove the existence of Sasquatch or Bigfoot.  How would you go about doing it?  You'd probably ask these types of questions:

1.  Is it theoretically possible?  A 30 foot tall primate is not possible (sorry, King Kong fans).  However, the tallest human was almost nine feet in height (Robert Wadlow; abnormal levels of human growth hormone), and the fossil primate Gigantopithecus was alleged to be nine feet in height (although the jaws I've seen make me wonder about that).

2.  Is there any physical evidence?  I know, everyone wants a body.  But how many of us ever see the body of other big predators, like bears or cougars?  But there should be SOMETHING!  DNA through hair or saliva.  Droppings.  SOMETHING!

3.  Is there more to the photographic evidence?  Can modern forensic techniques be applied to old video footage?

4.  How are hoaxes separated from other evidence?

This video really is interesting in attempting to answer questions 2 and 3 above, with sound analysis, DNA analysis, and gait and locomotion analysis.

There is a companion book to accompany this DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sasquatch-Legend-Meets-Science/dp/0765312174/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science</a>.",1267056000,10,1306,5.66321243523316
3910016,5,B002D97OFU,"I It was a good purchase because any Bigfoot enthusiast would love the scientific analysis done throughout the film. One thing that really impressed me was that one year after the PG footage was filmed, a comparison was made by fiming a six foot five inch man walking along the same path as the Bigfoot took in the original footage. It dwarfed the man in a side by side frame. There are a lot of interesting studies done in this documentary and a few surprising results. Well worth watching.",1368403200,8,491,4.52808988764045
3910017,4,B002D97OFU,"Was a gift for my father. He's watched it many times and definetely has enjoyed it very much. Though pricey, worth it for the enthusiast. Less screen time than you would think, but still some good content.",1360195200,5,205,4.5675675675675675
3910018,2,B002D97OFU,This video didn't have any content that isn't available in other DVD's with much less cost.  Disappointed that I spent so much money on a 1 hour (instead) of 2 hour documentary.  Don't recommend wasting your money on it.  I'm a Sasquatch addict so it didn't meet up with my expectations.,1359504000,,287,4.588235294117647

3910021,5,B002D97OFU,"This was written scientifically, but even a layman can understand the facts.  Every concept was backed up by factual evidence.  It made everything very reasonable and logical.  In the past, people who reported bigfoot sightings or other evidence were considered ""nuts""  or just publicity seekers....(almost like people who  have seen aliens)  but, this information is evidence from credible individuals as well as scientists.",1357344000,2,425,5.666666666666667
3910022,3,B002D97OFU,"""Sasquatch: Legend meets Science"" is a pro-Bigfoot documentary, claiming that solid scientific evidence for the existence of a North American ape really does exist. To be honest, the film is quite boring - ""Ancient Mysteries: Bigfoot"" narrated by Leonard Nimoy is better. Still, I suppose ""Sasquatch"" is a must see for those who want to hear the ""believer"" side of the story.

One piece of evidence discussed is the footprints from various parts of the United States attributed to Bigfoot. An expert concludes that they aren't compatible with human footprints or those of any known ape, pointing to the ""fingerprints"" on certain parts of the feet. Another researcher has analyzed hundreds of purported Bigfoot footprints from various parts of North America and concluded that their size has a bell-shaped distribution, which is apparently to be expected if the prints are genuine. Perhaps it's just me, but I find purely statistical evidence unconvincing - some statistics prove astrology (apparently Scorpios are more likely to read astrology books?!).

The analysis of the famous Patterson-Gimlin film is more interesting. The researchers argue that the creature doesn't walk or move like a human, and that gorilla suits simply weren't that advanced back in 1967. Nor did people in general have the knowledge necessary to fake the walk of a great ape-like creature.

There is also evidence that is inconclusive at best. The team analyzes a spooky sound recording, drawing the conclusion that the calls are indeed made by a primate...but that this could include humans! DNA tests from the so-called Skookum print come up with absolutely nothing, although the team feels that at least some of the mysterious prints weren't made by an elk or other known animal. The researchers also prove that a ""running Bigfoot"" in the sensational Memorial Day footage could have been an ordinary man, and that he isn't really running very fast - the team's college runner was substantially faster. The speed-runner Bigfoot is just an illusion created by the camera angle.

I haven't read the accompanying book by Jeffrey Meldrum (yet), but so far I think the evidence for Bigfoot is suggestive but nevertheless inconclusive. Of course, the main problem with ""cryptids"" is precisely their strange ability to remain cryptic - decade after decade, century after century. Why doesn't *some* of these creatures, which supposedly exist all over the world, even in the vicinity of big cities, ever get caught or killed? The flesh-and-blood school of cryptozoology has the same problem as the nuts-and-bolts school of ufology: if thousands of literal space craft roam our skies, land on our fields and even dive under water, why hasn't anyone been able to catch a single alien?

Perhaps Bigfoot is a projection of our collective unconscious? But, of course, that's an explanation even more weird than the phenomenon itself... ;-)",1351209600,3,2906,5.187633262260128
3910023,5,B002D97OFU,"This is hands down the best Bigfoot documentary out there. I have seen everything on the subject that I can get my hands on, and this is by far the best presentation of the scientific methods used to study the possibility of a great ape in North America. It is presented as a great ape or some other form of primate, so if you enjoy the ""magical"" bigfoot who rides away on his unicorn when you spot him, this may not be for you, but if you seriously consider the possibility that there is a previously unknown species in the furthest reaches of our continent, then it is worth the money.",1328140800,3,587,4.297297297297297
3910024,5,B002D97OFU,"This is a must-have dvd for the bigfoot enthusiast. It was produced by Doug Hajicek with WhiteWolf Entertainment, the same people who brought us Monster Quest. It is narrated by Stacy Keach who has a nice voice for documentaries.

The investigations take a look at about 17 different categories of evidence: fossil evidence, new species discoveries, dermal ridges, the sasquatch body, images, step frequency, biomechanics, forensic measurements, Patterson-Gimlin film, behavior parallels, vocalizations, visual misidentification, track morphology, kinesiology, soft tissue pathology, statistics, and DNA.

Some very interesting conclusions are drawn from these studies. For example, did you know human dermal ridges run one direction while primate dermal ridges run another? Some of the tracks that were found exhibit dermal ridges and were examined by a professional. Buy the dvd and find out what he said :)

Bonus sections:

The dvd is worth the price for the bonus section alone!

The bonus section contains four different Sasquatch films (including Patterson-Gimlin film), a still image gallery, sighting information, and a Q&A section.

The films aren't just tacked on the end like an afterthought. They are digital copies made from the master so no degredation creeps in. Also, interesting views are highlighted by being zoomed in and looped for your convenience. Maybe you will make your own discovery by watching these. Personally, I thought I saw the calf muscle working in the first few steps of the Patterson-Gimlin film. (Remember the Otzi the Iceman? Hundreds of professionals overlooked the obvious arrowhead in his shoulder x-ray for years!) You also get to conduct zoomed-in frame-by-frame analysis.

I suggest buying this dvd through Whitewolf Entertainment. It will show support for the people who actually bring you crypto-type of programs. Not to mention, they do care about the customer.

This is dvd is great for the armchair Sasquatch hunter.",1295308800,14,1966,5.486754966887418
3910025,5,B002D97OFU,"I take a lot of ribbing from friends and family for believing that a large primate type animal ""could"" live in the Pacific North West.  It is understandable I suppose, the idea is out of touch with today's belief that we've discovered all that can be found and not to mention, the only people who tend to be ""eye witnesses"" are people with two-part first names like Bubba Joe or Dwayne Bob, all of whom relay their tale in a wife beater T-shirt while sporting a very 80's Mullet in need of a trim.  With Legend meets Science, you don't see these types of witnesses; it is more believable when real men of science speak out about the possibility of its existence.  It seems to me Dr. Meldrum must truly be convinced of a creature's existence because he has really stuck his neck out for the scientific community to chop it off.  When it comes to BF I can't say anyone group is better than the other. Scientists who should be open to theory immediately stonewall the subject out of fear of ridicule while BF Hunters seem to have their own smug attitudes by having been self appointed experts.  Then there are the people who just want to get their name in the paper for fifteen seconds (Like Billy Bob).  The video falls short in some areas but overall it is one of the most convincing ones out there.  Does Sasquatch exist? The Native Americans sure seemed to think it did (all the nations and not just one) and this video helps shed light on the reasons why. For the record, I don't believe this thing lives anywhere east of the Rockies, The swamps of Florida and especially anywhere in Ohio or Kentucky.

Ok, now I'm ready to read all the smug BF ""experts"" comments",1292284800,6,1665,4.436065573770492

8364984,3,B002D97OFU,"It's earnest. It sticks to the facts. It focuses on the observations and conclusions of experts in their fields. It contains exhaustive examinations of three sightings caught on film.
And I just did not find it all that interesting.
Certainly not as disappointing as being strung along through an episode of a Bigfoot investigation show only to have nothing conclusive at the end and a lot of redneck commentary in between. But, STILL... I found this very dry and very padded. Why should I need to go to the special features to reexamine the original films when the footage is repeated many times during the actual program?
Don't get me wrong, I'm all about facts, I don't want sensationalist, unverified conclusions. However, I feel if you don't have sufficient facts, commentary and investigation details to make for an entertainingly interesting program, don't make one.
So, I've got the best resolution possible on the Patterson film, which is nice to have. Otherwise? Meh.
And speaking of the Patterson film, I want to believe it's real but why don't these recent docs even address the controversy surrounding it, where one person involved allegedly admitted it was a hoax? It doesn't look like one to me but I feel the question is conspicuous in its absence.",1468886400,,1264,4.938967136150235

I found this DVD to be a lot of repeat information, compared to being able to look up info on the internet, and it was a shorter DVD than I thought it would be.  If you have already been researching Bigfoot information then this DVD will be boring to watch.  If you are new to acquiring knowledge about Bigfoot then it will be worth watching.
