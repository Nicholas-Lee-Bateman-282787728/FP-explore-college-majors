The only possible use for it is another school project showing  it as an example of absolutely each and everything that can be done wrong in making a film .
Painful to watch, though its SO bad you may get a laugh or two out of it !",1459296000,,308,3.8125

8549127,1,B00AADAIV8,"This story takes place in Detroit with a plot and subplot. Our Ex-con (Alan Bradley) falls in love with Nicole Saint Aubin (Ashlee McLemore) who then disappears. Alan enlists the aide of a boring pompous psychic Dr. Akbar (Joel Mitchell) a man who stress tests his camel hair jacket as he searches for clues to the past and an acting school.

Meanwhile Benjamin Banneker Smith (Joel Steingold) is greasing the palms of local politicians in order to build Saint Aubin complex a collection of futuristic retail stores, office buildings, and condos in the middle of downtown Detroit. The film was slow and virtually no action. There was no ghost horror and the drama was bad. Classified as a science fiction, it is hardly that. Most movie watches won't make it past 3 minutes of the pretentious talk of Dr. Akbar, a man who apparently learned everything he knows about the occult from watching Saturday morning cartoons.

The two tales come together at the end is a poorly scripted fashion. Joel Steingold was the closest thing to an actor in this production. The production was  poorly written, acted, and directed. The editing also sucked as there were moments within the film of absolute silence, apparently were they spliced takes together. This is a 2011 film recycled at Redbox for you viewing pleasure...good luck with that.
