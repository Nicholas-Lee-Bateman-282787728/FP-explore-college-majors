4981939,5,B006AYZ1D6,"I find this to be relaxing and kind of mind wuandering. It's awesome video , ok sound and would say this is a must have DVD to show off your home theater to your friends!",1358035200,,170,3.8857142857142857
4981940,5,B006AYZ1D6,"This blu-ray disc contains over an hour of moving fractal images.  At 1920x1080p resolution, the sharp digital animations are awesome to look at.  Using the computer program Apophysis, Chris Ursitti has created a series of beautiful flame fractals similar to the animations created for the screensaver Electric Sheep, the term coming from from Philip K Dick's sci-fi novel.  The many colorful graphic animations flow seamlessly into one another and often have a high level of complexity and detail that merit repeated viewings to comprehend it all.",1345161600,3,548,5.348837209302325
4981941,5,B006AYZ1D6,This dvd has great swirling psychedelic patterns and nice music.  It's great fun to have on in the background.  The music is enough to add a positive energy but without being distracting.  Highly recommended.,1327795200,5,208,5.0588235294117645

8495885,5,B006AYZ1D6,"A while back, I owned some fractal programs and tried (in vain) to design some fractals that were as intricately beautiful as they are fascinating.  Almost total failure.  LOL ~ Fractals are based on algorithms and math the Mandelbrot set (see photo).  If you're more curious, you can Google ""fractals"" and a world of beauty will unfold before you.  This video is set to musical scores and fractals.  The infinite number of fractals that can be made from the Mandelbrot set are just that ... infinite.  It was a frivolous buy and thoroughly enjoyable in Hi Def.  I recommend it highly for those who like ""screen savers"" ... for your HDTV ... LOL  ~  ~ enjoy !",1498521600,,659,4.564102564102564
8495886,5,B006AYZ1D6,Wow! this is quite the show and is a lot of fun to just watch.,1420243200,,62,3.2
8495887,5,B006AYZ1D6,"I've bought several copies of this and given them to friends for birthdays, stocking stuffers, etc.  Very interesting to watch.",1416960000,,127,5.35
8495888,3,B006AYZ1D6,not worth the price .,1415318400,,21,3.4
8495889,4,B006AYZ1D6,"it is fun to watch, gets repetitive but fun none the less. Not much more to say so I wont",1403395200,,89,3.5
8495890,2,B006AYZ1D6,"I like some of the other BluScenes, but not this one.  It is not as 'pretty' and does not transition as nicely as the others do.  I would not order this again.",1391126400,,159,3.9375
8495891,5,B006AYZ1D6,"OMG - This Blu ray sets the bar for visuals set to great surround music!  The visuals are just stunning and captivating. The music I like very much too - I can only best describe it as ""techno crossed with Satriani.""  You can also choose a setting for 5.1 Dolby Digital (which sounds amazing) if you don't have 7.1 DTS. I can see this DVD appealing to engineer geeks as well as artists of all types. I love having this in the background while I work on projects as I find it as motivating as it is relaxing.",1386201600,2,507,4.163265306122449
8495892,4,B006AYZ1D6,"This is the fourth fractal DVD I've purchased. Without question the best so far.  Good pattern transition and color. The only negative aspect of this composition is that the images move too fast if you wish to select your own music such as New Age or Classical. For example, it's a great fractal to watch to the soundtrack of the movie ""Artificial Intelligence"", but is best viewed with the Blue-ray player set to the fastest slow speed possible. The frame-to-frame flicker associated with slow-speed play is tolerable.",1380412800,3,519,4.9655172413793105
8495893,5,B006AYZ1D6,"This DVD is beautiful and mesmerizing, especially with the sound on.  The sound is industrial/techno, which is like, but the DVD also produces a beautiful piece of moving art, without the sound.  The BluRay is fantastic, so bright and crisp.  Very cool indeed!",1371340800,3,260,5.0
