7501170,4,B002BFBAYW,"I'm a huge fan of Kazan and Horror so this should have been the perfect mix but it's just really really bad.
Perhaps I've been spoiled by so many great movies in this genre over the last several years.
4/5 stars so it doesn't mess up my recommendations but my real grade would be 3/5 or lower if not for the great actors.",1479081600,,321,4.111111111111111
7501171,4,B002BFBAYW,"Lizzy (Ella Ballentine) is being taken to her dad's house by someone who was not the prefect mom (Zoe Kazan). The film starts off showing us Lizzy is a well adjusted daughter considering her alcoholic mother who is less than understanding. They encounter difficulty along the road on a rainy night...in need of a tow truck and ambulance to fill the time. Yes there is a ""monster"" that we do get to see as Elizabeth has flashbacks to her life, none of which was good.

This is a well acted film. You feel the intensity of the relationship between mother and daughter, as well as the sadness. With the various details and aspects at work,  Bryan Bertino (director/writer) has turned a good jump scare story into a metaphor of facing and conquering our own monster in order to move on.

7501172,1,B002BFBAYW,"The monster looks terrible and every decision the mother makes is eye-rollingly bad. The symbolism is heavy handed and tired. It's not scary, not emotionally moving and not even really interesting. You can't even enjoy it as a bad B-movie, as the filmakers obviously believed they were making something great here, but they didn't. The trailer looked pretty good though.

Disappointing. I like a good monster movie.",1478995200,,415,5.1940298507462686
7501173,4,B002BFBAYW,"Our youngest heroine, Lizzy, starts out by sharing the warning her mother has given her, a somewhat paraphrased and cautioned tale from a 1903 nursery rhyme, by saying, ""My mom tells me there's no such things as monsters.  But she is wrong.  They're out there, waiting for you, watching.  They're in the dark, sometimes where you see them, sometimes where you don't.  I know that now.""

From there on out, whether it's clips of a life lived, or clips of one worth fighting for, we know it's going to be a sad story.  And it is.

SPOILERS---SPOILERS---CAUTION FOR THE SPOILERS

I've read the few reviews that are here, right now (there are five of them that have come before my own).  I'd like to talk about something I don't think anyone noticed, or even commented on, and that's probably got a lot to do with the way a person's been raised, and how they've lived, in comparison to the lives of both Kathy (Zoe Kazan) and her daughter Lizzy (Ella Ballentine).

To talk about this, I have to get a little personal, and that's not something I'm used to doing here (on Amazon) or really ever in these small reviews I jot down, but since it's something so central to the story (IMHO), I'll do it for the sake of elucidation. ;D  The story, ""The Monster"" isn't really about that terrible thing that creeps, and slithers, and stalks about.  Well, it both _is_ and it isn't.  In many ways (I think in _most_ ways, honestly) the story is about abuse.  Let's take a look...

The story starts out with young Lizzy.  We find her, buried amidst a sea of empties (bottles and cans), and what looks like the dregs of an after-party that's gotten out of control.  She's doing what all children in these situations do.  She's cleaning up the evidence, removing the reminder, she's staunchly burning one more bad memory into the high resolution clarity that only this kind of problem can leave.  She's building up hate so can make it (in the long run), and watching Ella Ballentine, you can actually _see it_.  You can see it in her every movement, in her facial expressions, in the way she breathes.  This girl can really sell it!

We watch Lizzy packing.  Not just one bag, but two.  We differentiate between what's happening here -- which person in the picture is the mother, and which is the child.  This kind of role reversal, mixed with alcohol, and possibly drugs (we don't know at this point), animosity, possibly hatred, along with broken promises, and broken dreams (we discover more as the early story unfolds), can really only lead to one of two places-- either the girls are running away from something together, or they're running away from each other!  As things progress, we find out its the latter.

Emotions are high between these two.  Because as the flashbacks show us, things haven't always been good.  As a matter of fact, things have been pretty frickin' awful.  Not only substance issues, or clearly domestic problems, but neglect, verbal, and then even physical abuse.  Anyone who's ever been through this kind of trauma Lizzy has knows how the fear can eat you.  The fear of the unknown.  The fear of when the other shoe is going to drop.  The fear of when the yelling starts, but even more so when the yelling _stops_.  The fear of your bedroom door opening.  The fear of the garage door opening.  The fear of the people they bring home with them, or the fear of the ones they lock out!  The fear of the sting the words leave (and how they don't wash away, even with time), or the fear of how to hide the bruises so DCFS doesn't take you away.  The fears... the fears are too great in numbers to be told.

But... that monster, even if it's your own mother, no matter how cruel, or ugly, or mean she gets... it doesn't mean you love her any less, despite how much you hate her.  It doesn't mean you love her less, but it sure doesn't mean you'd stop yourself at putting a knife to her throat, while you whisper, ""I hate you. I hate you. I wish you'd go away.""  Almost like a prayer.  A prayer for the dying-- the dying soul of a child crushed under the weight of a problem so unjust.  Truly nightmare territory...

Only, and that's where ""The Monster,"" as the movie -- and less the allegory -- becomes the Grade B (or C, possibly D ;D) Horror Flick it is!  There's something lurking out there in the dark, as both Kathy and Lizzy warn.  It's out there, and it basically runs a wolf straight into their path, as the two of them are only hours from separating (for what sounds like quite a while).  The accident ruins the car, forcing the girls to call 911, and Lizzy's father (who is waiting up for her arrival).  As a tow truck driver responds to their call for help, the monster then wreaks havoc, killing the man, and threatening the lives of both girls.

At this point, it becomes a story of redemption.  Kathy, as the mother, who up until this point has been a deeply questionable parental unit, has to finally break down and show her daughter just how much she loves her.  Naturally, as is the case with most of these stories, the only way Kathy can truly prove her love is with self-sacrifice.  Despite there being a much better solution, one that comes quite quickly to Lizzy after Kathy meets the business end of some super large chompers!  It was funny (ironic) to me that Lizzy told her mom that she never listened to her, and that she _should_... Had Kathy only listened, and not gone out to try to draw the monster away, Lizzy would have thought of the make-shift flame thrower, and the two of them could have gone for help together.

I gave this film a 7/10 for the education it tries to bestow on its audience about abuse.  The audience has to be sentient enough to understand, unfortunately, and if they _don't_, i'ts only because they've never been there.  Without having gone through it, I think it's pretty rare the person who's going to get the allusion.  If the audience ""gets it,"" it's only because they've been there, themselves, or have seen it through the eyes of a friend or loved one.

It's possible the very literal answer the movie gives us is that the monster has to die in order for the abused to survive (and move on), but anyone who's ever gone through this kind of abuse knows that's not true-- not in the literal or non-literal sense.  Then again, the truth doesn't always make for a sexy ending -- like the two of them sitting together on their therapist's couch, getting ready for a session filled with deep analysis!  Sounds like a snooze to me! ;D Better with the blood and gore!

I gave ""The Monster"" a 7/10 for a powerful, moving, and dirty-gritty-raw performance from Zoe Kazan!  A heart-breaking, and riveting portrayal of a young girl, lost, from Ella Ballentine.  And a BLINK-AND-YOU'LL-MISS-IT surprise appearance from horror fan, Scott Speedman.",1478995200,3,6800,4.526661197703035

7501176,4,B002BFBAYW,"(The Monster) is an effective Creature Feature about a mother and her young daughter whom we learn through flashbacks have a tumultuous relationship because of alcaholism and abuse. Therefore giving the title of the film a double meaning.

After a rather nasty fight, Kathy (Zoe Kazan) is driving her daughter Lizzy (Ella Ballentine) to go stay with her father played briefly by (Scott Speedman) when they run off the road and get stranded then trapped and stalked by a strange, mysterious and angry creature. The lighting and cinematography are very well executed and so was the foreboding piano score.

There's quite a bit of blood and some gore as the creature attacks his prey. It is a horror film but the bulk of the story revolves around the relationship between mother and daughter. It's definitely not a feel good film but  this is the genre we love.

Bottom line : Great acting,pretty solid story and an above average Monster flick!",1478822400,18,941,4.8625

7501181,5,B002BFBAYW,Ive skipped over this movie for years and finally decided to watch it with my daughter. SO glad i did. The acting was suprsingly good and the monster was incredible.

7501184,3,B002BFBAYW,I gave it 3 stars because I thought it was pretty good acting and a more complex story line than most horror films. The mother and daughter had a love hate relationship due to her drinking problem. The mother had her own demons to fight with alcohol and the daughter was tired of constantly being let down by her so called parent who was more like a really bad older sister. I believe they both truly loved each other and new it. The monster was not very realistic looking therefor not believable and that was the low point of the movie for me.,1531612800,,544,4.29126213592233

7501190,4,B002BFBAYW,"As far as the people that have given this movie a poor review, they have no idea what they're talking about. This is a great horror film that actually has good character development. The characters are multidimensional and the relationship between the mother and daughter is heartbreaking. While the movie is a little slow (I think 10-15 minutes could be trimmed) the flashbacks that give you insight into the relationship of the main characters add a lot of depth to the film, something that is severely lacking in a lot of horror films. Give this movie a shot and you won't be sorry!",1530748800,,585,4.689320388349515
7501191,1,B002BFBAYW,"I am usually not one to leave reviews, but after watching this piece of flaming garbage, I was flabbergasted that it received a three and a half star rating.

The acting was horrendous from all of the main actors, in fact, they were so terrible, it was a relief to have an extra on screen; the storyline was a mess, monotonous, pandering, and mishandled abusive relationships; there were about two sets, the house and the mother's car, and 99% of the movie is spent filmed within the mother's car, and while that could have been filmed in an interesting manner to fuel the storyline, the repetitive use of overused camera angles, such as shot-reverse-shot, made me feel nauseated, cramped, and bored, as if I were in an unending road trip; and, finally, the ""monster,"" if you could even call it that, was laughable: it appeared to be a sweaty, defaced Jim Henson puppet, may he rest in peace having never seen this disaster.

If you actually want to watch a quality horror film with depth, quality acting, and natural dialogue, check out House on Haunted Hill, Carrie (1976), Needful Things, Mother!, It Follows, Hereditary, or It (new or old version); and if you want campy fun horror then do yourself a favour and watch some Jim Wynorski, The Stuff, Prom Night, Creep, or Creep 2, but honestly just save yourself the headache and stay away from this rancid dumpster dive...or if you really are in the mood for decent trash, watch Gotti, at least you can laugh through the pain.",1530662400,,1479,4.684615384615385

Is it eating them? because I have to think this monster would be Thanksgiving level stuffed after eating 2 people much less ... I think 5 people total. Does it have a freezer and one of those zip-loc vacuum bag things back in its lair? ... like it's gonna save them for later?
Is it bored and it's just playing with it's victims for fun? why?

effective and simple, this doesn't ever get too big for its britches. The characters are sympathetic and even throwaway characters that in most movies would be cardboard cutouts are given their time and seem like real people so when they are inevitably killed it's all the more shocking.",1527465600,,735,4.526315789473684
7501201,1,B002BFBAYW,I hate this movie. It shows a really sad relationship between mother and daughter. But take that hard to watch crap and add a freaking corny syfy monster. Ughh.... just awful.

7501202,3,B002BFBAYW,"Strong central performances and excellent use of (mostly) single location shooting is largely offset by poor pacing and plotting. This is not a monster movie where anyone goes against tropes of the genre - if there's a scary noise in the dark, someone is going to leave safety to investigate it. If there is a dumb decision to be made in a situation, someone is going to make it. If there's a plan to be had, it's going to be something the audience identifies well before the characters. All of which made it hard to root for the characters. Monster movies where smart people do their best and are failing anyways are frightening. Movies where dumb people do dumb things and the expected happens, not so much. Entertaining for fans of the genre, but it's a frustrating watch: a much better film could have been made with this material, if the writer director had just aimed a bit higher.",1525910400,,887,4.584905660377358

7501208,5,B002BFBAYW,"I thought this would be a cheesy b-flick, but I got totally sucked into the mother/daughter storyline up against the monster. With a throwback to the more handmade monster types (but this one still looks pretty awesome) there's enough jump-scares and downright tension and fear to keep you on the edge of your seat, while you simultaneously get swallowed up by the drama between these two. The mom is an alcoholic, and likely an addict, and their relationship is just fraught with issues. The girl is definitely emotionally traumatized by all of it, swinging between being the absolute adult in the situation, and showing just how young she really is. Maybe it's because I'm a daughter, and now I have a daughter of my own, but the acting here totally tore at my heartstrings. In my opinion, it was portrayed very realistically, beautifully raw, and these two actresses earned the 5 stars even if we never quite learn if it was all real, or some kind of weird post-car crash hallucination.

It is way above most monster movies coming out with all the CGI, terrible acting, and script consisting of people screaming at each other.

For a monster flick, it is ok, the monster is not well done and the creature creator obviously flunked anatomy class in school as some of the creature's proportions are completely unrealistic and unusable.  As for the story itself, it is more of a psychological drama that flashes back and forth from the ""present"" accident to the ""past"" of the dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship.  3.5 stars for keeping my interest and for being better than many of the recent Prime movies I have seen in the past few months.",1513468800,,558,4.852631578947369

The lead actresses give raw, realistic performances, the things they say and do to one another are harsh and brutal. In some ways, the film is maybe more about redemption from the monsters of their past.

7501241,5,B002BFBAYW,"This is a movie that could easily have been either just another fun goof of a creature feature or a ScyFy channel level piece of garbage. Instead what you get is a tense drama about the purely toxic relationship between an alcoholic mother and her preteen daughter and a savage encounter with an unknown beast in the woods. I haven't seen a film this gripping about a disturbing parent/child relationship since the excellent Babadook. The acting was astounding, the pacing was perfect and the monster was a wonderful piece of practical effects.

An abusive neglectful mother is taking her daughter to live with her father, realizing that her child is completely fed up with her and that she herself is an unfit mother. They hit a wolf while driving and are left stranded late at night on a lonely road in the woods waiting for both a tow truck and an ambulance. Needless to say they are not alone in the woods. Though you understand their relationship withun the first scene it gets fleshed out in flashbacks that are peppered throughout the film which detail not only how awful things are for two of them and yet give tiny glimpses of the burried connection between parent and child. With the situation becoming one of survival the protagonists deep feeling of love for one another rise furiously to the surface as they fight to live through this horrific encounter with an unknown creature.

The acting and chemistry between the leads is superb, and made my heart ache for this broken family. What should have been a generic monster flick is instead a master class on drama, characterization and cinematography. Though the monster is a man in a rubber suit the director gets the most out of it with an athletic performance by the creature actor and perfect use of high contrast lighting, letting us see enough, but not too much of the beast. The attacks by the monster are nothing less than savage! It was akin to watching the mauling DiCaprio suffered in The Revenant and all done without any CGI as far as I could see! It could be that the monster is a metaphor/dream induced by the crash as it seems to be driven far more by rage than appetiite but ultimately that is for the viewer to decide for themselves.",1508457600,6,2213,4.642857142857143

7501243,4,B002BFBAYW,"Zoe Kazan (the mother) and Ella Ballentine (the daughter) are both terrific in this film. I liked the writer/director's use of flashbacks which provided context to mother/child relationship. There are a few times when the pacing dragged, specifically in the beginning when they're trying to figure out what is happening but for the most part it was engaging. I like the idea that the monster seems to be an allegory for the ""troubles"" in the family (I don't want to give anything away here, so I'll just refer to it as ""troubles) and the eventual redemption and ultimate victory the story provides. No, it's not going to win any awards (horror so rarely does, after all) but I found it both entertaining and thought provoking.

Like many horror movies, it can be taxing on your willingness to suspend disbelief - but there are some genuinely tense and at times emotional moments during its short duration that made it worth the view. The actor's did quite well within a very small frame. The monster design looks like something from the 70's, which can work in some ways but should have remained as hidden as possible due to a lack of polish and convincing machinations to bring it to life. Atmosphere and suspense are where this short but sweet horror film succeeds.",1505174400,,615,4.6

What really bothered me were inexcusable directional errors, such as Lizzy being in the rain several times but not becoming wet; Lizzy standing in the rain long enough to get wet, but after entering the car to join her mother, her clothes are dry. Also, during one scene the monster suddenly had a black cape flowing under its body. That's just wrong.
The monster looked silly. I wondered if there were more of them, or if it just lived out there all alone. What did it eat to maintain its ""healthy"" appearance? Eventually wolves would get the heck out of dodge. And other animals.
The use of vague flashbacks to provide exposition was a poor decision. Unfortunately, I had zero concern for the two main characters and could not wait for the film to end. I think it's great that some people enjoyed it, but I am not one of them.",1505088000,2,933,4.559523809523809

This is an excellent entry in the mother-horror category. The mother-child relationship is fraught with potential horror under even the best circumstances. When things aren't good, it's utterly terrifying. In The Monster, a creature terrorizes a young mother and tween-early teenaged daughter on what was already meant to be their last night together (the daughter was leaving to move in with her father and stepmother). Uncomfortable flashbacks of their truly horrible relationship are spliced in between present day scenes of the monster waylaying them on a dark, stormy side road. I don't want to give the entire film away, but the depiction of an unintentionally toxic mother's love for her child is exquisite. Bothe actors absolutely nailed it, and there's not a bit of bad dialogue or hokum to slow the roll.

I did feel like there were a couple of threads that never got tied in, but maybe that's okay. Recommended for viewers who liked The Babadook, The Taking of Debra Logan.",1501200000,2,1118,4.91005291005291

7501285,3,B002BFBAYW,"I counted a total of six actors throughout the entire movie and the film location never changed much, leading me to believe this was an extremely low budget film. The acting was okay with no special effects. As the story began, mom ""an alcoholic"" overslept on a day when she's taking her daughter to grandmothers house, presumably to live with her. Once they're on the road and well into the trip, mom while completely sober, strikes something on the road that disables her vehicle and leaves the two of them stranded on a dark lonely road. They were driving along the backroads that nobody uses much anymore, but there are still operational low intensity street lamps to light the way.

After the collision mom and daughter noticed something lying on the road. After checking their wounds, they exited the vehicle and tried to determine what it was and if iwas dead. Mom finds an extremely large fang embedded in a wolf, and determined that maybe it had been in a fight with something and was trying to get away when it was hit.

After 911 was called and a tow truck driver arrives during a heavy thunderstorm. As the tow truck drive arrives, the dead wolf is now missing in the glare of its headlights. Not knowing anything about the missing wolf, the tow driver inspects the disabled vehicle and determines he must crawl underneath it to repair a broken axle before hoisting it onto the wrecker. Not sure why, but big mistake.

What seems like several hours later, an ambulance shows up and a similar series of events take place. I don't care to give away the plot, so that other viewers might enjoy watching, but overall I thought the movie was slow, the story lame, and I really wish that I'd spent an hour and a half doing something more productive, like watching the grass grow.",1499558400,2,1785,4.6069182389937104

While he does gets a decent start on character development that mostly works despite some overwrought writing and acting, the static set piece and drawn out end battle bleed away any real tension. Flashbacks are overused and ultimately come too late and the well shot and creepy final locations overstay their welcome. Few films are able to pull off this Babadook-esque having your cake and eating it too morality monster mash, and despite a good college try, the Monster fails along with all the others.",1499299200,,587,4.821782178217822
7501289,4,B002BFBAYW,"The movie is very similar in execution to The Babadook where the horror elements are used as heavy symbolism for how real-life codependency and emotional abuse typically work. I think people should know that going in, but the movie does seem to set up some warning flags in the beginning. For anyone who has experienced something similar the movie will definitely bring up emotions you may have rather not wanted to feel which isn't an accusation against the film, but rather a compliment. You can tell whoever created the story really knew their stuff. The ending scene seems a little ham-fisted to me, but other then that the execution of the story and acting really came together to make something incredible.

Also, unlike movies dealing with similar subject matter; I really appreciated that the director didn't go with the happy ending that seems so pervasive in media. Instead it told a story that tends to happen more in situations like this and explains the contradictory feelings that most movies are afraid to try and show (such as the flashback scene with the daughter and the knife and the final flashback of the movie).

So I would say watch it but with a warning: if you've experienced something similar or know someone who has the movie is a bit of a pot-stirrer emotionally. Otherwise it's just your typical monster movie and the secondary plot line may just go over your head which will make the movie a little boring.",1499040000,,1436,4.786290322580645

7501315,4,B002BFBAYW,"I feel like many people who rated this a 1 or 2 star (which I read some of the comments for) missed the entire point of this movie. Some people even gave it a one star because it wasn't a ""family friendly"" movie. What did you expect? First of all, it's a horror movie, which is a genre not known for being family friendly. Secondly, not every family is perfect or damn near perfect, which is exactly what this was trying to convey.

SPOILERS AHEAD

This movie represents an alcoholic mother who loves her daughter but struggles with her addiction to the point of abusing her, and a daughter who loves her mother but also hates her for the abuse and alcoholism. It is a very deep movie that has multiple meanings to it. Was the monster real? It's possible, but it is also very likely that it is a figment of her imagination regarding her mother's abuse. One rating mentioned that the whole monster sequence was a dream, which I find fascinating. Perhaps the daughter was just dreaming the entire thing, and the monster represented the worst traits of her mother. Or perhaps the monster was the little girl struggling to come to terms with her love for her mom.

Either way, the acting of both the mother (Zoe Kazan) and daughter (Ella Ballentine) was phenomenal. I don't usually get emotionally involved in movies but this one had me crying with the end scene (seriously, that almost never happens). I also really liked the monster design. It wasn't original in my mind, as it seemed similar in design to the creature from ""Animal"" but it was well designed none-the-less.

The only reason I'm not giving this a higher rating than 4 stars is some of sequences of events didn't make sense. Firstly, the tow truck sequence. He didn't need to do anything to the car to get it onto the tow truck. To tow a car, you only need a place to connect the hook from the tow truck to the car's body, so this scene baffled me. It seemed like it was just in there to make sure the monster was able to attack the tow truck guy. Secondly, how did neither the mother nor daughter see the tow truck guy vanish? Surely he would have at least screamed when the monster grabbed him, but it seemed he just poofed . My guess is this was just to make the movie seem spookier. Finally, the scene where the mother basically sacrifices herself to the monster to get her daughter to safety. There wasn't any need for her to do that. The monster was clearly afraid of the light and, with the torch she made, the mother could have gotten her and her daughter back to the road. She also could have thought of the same idea the daughter did at the end - makeshift flamethrower (that was my first thought, anyways). Ultimately, I think the writers of the movie wanted to show that the movie was willing to do anything to keep her daughter safe regardless of the hostile relationship they had.

Nothing short of genius screenplay writing. This film is far, far beyond just something fun to watch. It has a wisdom and a lesson and gives the viewer an experience they cannot take their eyes from, or their minds. This is film making at its best. If it hadn't been a small movie, it would have been nominated for every kind of Oscar. I'm hard to please. I'm telling you, this is a brilliant movie that holds you in its grip, and you don't even have to consciously realize that the monstrous mothering the child has enduring is being played out in the rain (water and fire themes).

Now, this does NOT mean that there is no action, blood, etc. There certainly is! It's just that we learn a bit about Kathy and Lizzy, making them more than mere fodder to be mutilated. As circumstances quickly turn dire, their relationship deepens accordingly, and survival brings out a bond of which neither was aware.

Through flashbacks, we learn that the mother we already suspected was an alcoholic child abuser is, in fact, an alcoholic child abuser. I'm guessing The Monster is a not-so-subtle allegory for the destruction that alcoholism inflicts on people. That was my takeaway, anyway. The problem is that the flashbacks only beat us over the head with this notion and take us away from the story in the woods where a literal monster terrorizes the mother and daughter like a less interesting Cujo. The acting was pretty good (especially from the little girl) but the story just didn't work for me. If the monster is a symbol, was it really doing all the damage and killing all the people? If it wasn't, then where did it come from and why did it decide to play cat-and-mouse with the mother and daughter?

The ""monster"" lurks in the shadows of course, but this film is more about examining the monster that lives in both of the main characters.  The story unfolds and develops at a good pace to increase understanding of their relationship.  The monster in the woods is incidental.  I think it represents the ugliness in life and the challenge we all face to maintain control of our darker side. This is about the complex and often brutal relationship of a seriously flawed mother and her seriously damaged daughter.  And how their lives float on a thin veneer of both hate and love.  I couldn't figure out if it was dubbed or if the sound track was just way off.  I think the later, because the vernacular is absolutely current and convincing.  It's not high budget but it IS thought provoking, and there is a good dose of pathos thrown in to substantiate the title and satisfy those who merely want to watch a scary movie.

7501369,4,B002BFBAYW,"This movie was sincerely suspenseful, frightening at times, and paints a rich picture of a dysfunctional relationship between mother and daughter.  I have watched many low-budget horror films, especially in the creature feature vein, and this movie is truly satisfying, riveting, and worth watching.  Had I watched it in the theater, I would not have regretted all of the expense and trouble that comes with theater-going.  Having seen it for free as a part of Amazon Prime, man, was I happy I clicked ""Watch Now.""

From the acting to the set design to the script to the creature, it was all very believable.  Even the required choices for a horror film were well-motivated.  I could have done without the incessant f-bombs that younger writers insist on adding like ""uh's"" and ""likes,"" given how they pepper their real conversations with them... But the screenplay was very well crafted, the acting was very strong.  If not for the filmmaker choices outlined below in the spoilers section, I would have given this little indie 5 stars because it was such a surprise.

** SPOILER ALERTS** My only criticism would be certain choices in climax.  The dialog goes on far too long for someone who is dying, becoming redundant (which it never had before) and the script up to then had already done a great job of establishing these characters, their regrets and true feelings for one another. The other would be the hiding place the girl finds in the ambulance to stage -- then not stage -- her attack on the creature.  It would have been perfect for setting the creature ablaze inside the ambulance, then escaping herself while it burned inside the enclosed space, then a nice explosion to finish it off.  As staged, her hiding place was irrelevant and not enough accelerant to coat the smooth-skinned creature in flames; if it had somehow been drenched in leaking gas or oil or was conceived as hairy, then it would have worked better.",1488758400,,1931,4.821212121212121

7501372,5,B002BFBAYW,"This was a great movie. It was about more than the monster in the woods but not many of the reviews I read seemed to catch on to that. Lizzy's mom was an alcoholic, which made Lizzy's life chaotic and scary. She slept under the bed, she made herself a sheet tent and filled it with light and her favorite bear to hide from the fights her mom and the boyfriend had. Alcoholism, terrible home life, men screaming in her face, her mom's constant ups and downs because of her addiction... those were the first monsters Lizzy had to face. Those metaphorical monsters are what made the little girl who had to behave like a grown up tough enough to take down the physical monster in the woods. Also, it is clear that the way the movie ends means that addicts can have redeemable qualities and, when the rubber meets the road, will do what is necessary in tough situations to protect what they love most.  I would almost bet the person who wrote the story either has an addicts or lived with a parent of guardian who had one.
If you watched the movie with an eye for catching mistakes, then you missed the point and missed a really good movie. While there were issues like the female paramedic being hardly wet after taking a good walk in a downpour, they didn't detract from the movie at all.
Overall, the movie will become a favorite of mine and I will suggest it to others.",1488585600,,1368,4.364705882352941

Which would be fine normally in a movie like this one, but the monster and the effects are so hokey and unrealistic, they are impossible to believe. The director plays the game of 'show only a little monster at a time' for dramatic effect, but he doesn't do it in any kind of surprising ways. I've seen all these moves done better elsewhere. Add the phoniness of the creature and the effects surrounding the monster (which get worse as the movie progresses and you see more of the creature), and you get a guy in a monster suit taking a crap on a movie that had promise early. Things like the strength and behavior of the creature are inconsistent, as if the filmmakers didn't really know much about the monster, except it was bad, but they didn't know how bad.",1487894400,,1052,4.661290322580645

Oh, but wait, there's also some backstory, where we learn that a mother and daughter don't get along quite the way they're not getting along now, and that helps the story because, because...(monster?). Sorry, but apart from some ok suspense and decent kid acting, this movie does nothing but join the hordes of countless schlocky horror movies that offer no real interest except for...don't make me say it again.

I suppose we can draw some psychological, symbolic parallels between the mother, daughter, and why this movie was even made, such as, ""Omigod, we DO all have monsters inside us,"" or ""Jeez. Mom is a bitch,"" but does that actually help the story? Is there a story?

A horror movie with 666 reviews? I had to watch it just so I could write the 667th review. Turns out it was pretty decent. Better than the last few horror movies Amazon recommended, by a long shot. Nothing too unique nor original in this creature feature, but as someone who likes to spend a lot of time alone in the woods in the back country, it did creep me out a bit.  As others have pointed out, there are some slow moments around the interwoven backstory scenes, and the whole creature story is clearly allegory. That said, the monster is genuinely freaky....reminiscent of some other good creatures but still its own thing. I like that there wasn't a whole lot of suspense around getting to actually see the damned thing...just enough suspense and you get some heavy clues as to what this thing looks like pretty early on. As it builds and the film reveals even more, it doesn't cheapen or lessen the creepiness of the monster. That's what I call a good creature, and a good creature feature it was indeed. This was clearly shot on a budget, and this also does nothing to lessen the impact. Pretty solid acting, directing and photography. I recommend it.",1487203200,,1167,4.583732057416268

Solid plot that held my attention. It's tough to make something scary and pull at your heart-strings simultaneously. Let alone do it well.

Analysis (SPOILER): On the surface, you can completely take what you're given here without feeling cheated or confused. At this level, the movie is totally just a rather well done (acting, practical effects, makeup and costume etc.) monster flick. As far as my interpretation goes, I certainly will not label this movie so matter-of-factly. Without getting too juicy, I think that this estranged duo did in fact hit the road earlier than we as the viewers are lead to believe. Mom was still sauced from the night before and this causes a partially fatal, aggravated and intoxicated crash. The daughter survives the accident and the latter three quarters of the movie are a mental manifestation brought on as a coping mechanism to address the trauma at hand.

In other words, the monster is alcoholism.

7501424,4,B002BFBAYW,Happy to find a good monster movie.  Good opening story  following the relationship between the alcoholic mother and the daughter is agonizing and even worse in real life.  So glad it's not another found footage flick.  Entertaining.,1486598400,,233,5.216216216216216
7501425,4,B002BFBAYW,I don't get too in depth in my reviews...sorry.  Horror genre these days is lacking.  This is good.,1486598400,,99,4.444444444444445
7501426,2,B002BFBAYW,"Allegory...  Maybe it is.  I just didn't think the film was 'deep' enough to connect the dots to (spoiler) mom+addictions=Monster.  Monster seemed real enough; real people died--tow truck guy a cop or two.  Other people showed up when Mom and Daughter had their car wreck.  They 'hit a wolf'--or so they thought.  Flashbacks pop up, to show you the real love and the real hatred between mother and daughter....and mom's b.friend, Roy.  A scene with him terorrizing the child.

Again--so Freaking DARK!  These films are viewed on hand held devices and laptops.  For cryin out loud--can't film makers up the light so we can SEE what's going on???  I know it's night time, but we need some light to see what's happening.  Every horror film makes it so dark, it's hard to see.

Anyway, I stuck with it.  Monster was probably nice--if it hadn't been so dark.  I can't swear by the allegory theme monster is mother.  Monster seemed real.  Unless it's in the kid's head and SHE kills mother--shades of Norman Bates.

Nah.  I'm giving it a 2 star.  Nothing should be this cryptic.",1486598400,,1072,4.691891891891892

7501439,5,B002BFBAYW,"What a gem! And what a surprise given the ridiculous description of it on amazon. This is a beautifully written, acted, photographed and acted film, while managing to be genuinely frightening as well. Did I mention original? The characters are genuine and their relationships nuanced and deep. There is a real plot aside from what's frightening, involving a childlike young mother with problems, and a daughter who acts like her caretaker, but also, realistically gets furious when she is let down over and over. The love between them is ferocious in spite of guilt, hurt, anger coloring its expression.
Somehow there is also a well-done subplot about fear and courage...you'd think it would be too much to pack into one film, but it fits, flowing naturally from the storyline.
It's everything I want in a horror film: people I care about, acting like human beings (rather than surfaces for blood spatter) having real relationships worth writing about, and an excellent monster.

7501476,3,B002BFBAYW,"There may be spoilers in this review.  It's the story of a woman taking her daughter to her father's house.  On the way, there's an accident and they're stranded in the middle of nowhere and a monster of some kind is stalking them.

It's not your typical horror.  Frankly, that would have gone on too long.  And they'd have to invent all of these cliche things that your typical of horror movies do in order to fill out the time.  And even so, they did some of these things.  But the story keeps going to flashbacks of the girl and her mom's life.

Reminds me of reading a Stephen King novel where he goes off on all of these unrelated tangents about what the character did as a kid or some other nonsense.  It fills pages for him, but doesn't, IMO, add much if anything to the story.  It kind of leaves the story lacking to me.

I don't need to understand the backstory of the mother/daughter relationship.  I watched it for the same reason I watch most monster films.  A sort of ""what would I do"" thing.  How will they battle the monster?  How will they hide/stay safe?  The survival aspects.

They tried to redeem the mother at the end, but at that point, I just didn't care.  Their choices were so stupid that I really lost all interest as to whether the characters lived or died.",1486598400,,1284,4.323529411764706

When it ended, I secretly hoped that there would be a follow-up movie about the (spoiler alert) young girl that made it, despite her mom being killed. I was really impressed with the acting and the chemistry between these two actors. I hope they continue with their craft.

You need to read between the lines here SPOILERS: the fact that the ""monster"" is very human-like in form and that basically the only feature you really see is its teeth I believe was done intentionally. Really, I think this is more a coming-of-age story than a horror film, with the monster simply being a representation of the mother's alcoholism. There is much symbolism used from the child's toy right down to the ambulance. When looked at from a symbolic standpoint, the film is actually very intelligent and a realistic approach to the subject matter. The acting in this was wonderful, especially on the part of Ella Ballentine.

The story makes absolutely no attempt to be coherent. The only plausible explanation for such a sequence of events is an intoxicated editing room, managed by team of uninspired higher-ups. There's not even a good-bad quality to it, it's flat out bad-bad. On behalf of humanity, I excommunicate everyone attached to the project from my species.

It wasn't as bad as the old Godzilla movies with people in rubber monster suits jumping around the set, but it definitely reminded me of them. I agree with what someone else said about the rules being confusing: it's scared of light, but it prances around in front of headlights. It seems hungry, but then it throws food around on the windshield, on the ground, etc. Not too much logic to the monster at all.

7501563,1,B002BFBAYW,"Simple review.

There was a lot of potential here for a good horror movie. Characters that are relateable are always a good start. A flawed alcoholic mother and her young daughter make for interesting primary characters.  Dysfunctional family, check. Well done. 90% of the way to a watchable file... And then it fell short. Intelligence insultingly short.

When it came to the monster and the scenario everything went off the rails. Everything made no sense from the moment the car breaks down on forward.  I looked it up, screenplay was supposedly written by a man... but I have to admit that I felt like it was written by a woman with no understanding of cars or physics or any care whatsoever for realism. Yeah, I know, it's a fake monster in the woods, but there were so many insults to my intelligence along the way I could not enjoy the film or its characters. I guess I must have felt like it was a woman screen writer because the film had real merit on an interpersonal level, and yet was so bad when it came to even basic logic. I guess that Bryan Bertino the screen writer needs to have his balls confiscated. He is officially kicked out of the man club.

Here is  short and very incomplete list of the sheer stupidity that is this film.

Car breaks down. The front axle is broken. Instead of simply jacking the front end off the ground and towing their butts out of there, the tow truck driver spends 20 minutes playing around under the car in the rain, waiting to be eaten- which is what happens... what is he hoping to do down there? He doesn't have an arch welder, so what is it he plans to do under the car? When you tow a car the front end is usually off the ground, so why does he even care if the front axle is broken in the first place? Now that I think about it, the old beater they were driving was most likely rear wheel drive, which makes even less sense if that is possible. There is not even the remotest excuse for that guy to be under the car.

It gets dumber from there on. The creature turns out to fear light. Great. easy fix. Just stay in the crashed BRIGHTLY LIT ambulance till the sun comes up- problem solved. Or not. I guess you COULD walk into the woods with a lit torch, put the torch out and let the monster eat you in an effort to distract it from eating your daughter... Sure that is one way to go I guess. Kinda stupid, but whatever. I guess it is not half as stupid as how the mother must have felt after being eaten when her daughter takes the big bad monster out with a simple lighter and a can of aerosol.

Now, if you think any of this sounds the least bit plausible then you probably voted Trump, but let me tell you for the record that it is hard to kill a cat with a can of aerosol and a lighter, let alone a dripping wet, eight foot hairless monster from god knows where. I am not a huge fan of exposition as a rule, but I would love to know where this thing came from. Is it new to the area? You would think someone might have noticed an 8 foot tall man eating, highly flammable monster roaming the woods.

There is so much bad horror out in the world. Usually it is bad because the writer has no sense of charature development and no ability to build suspense. This film is bad simply because it insults our intelligence.",1485993600,2,3273,4.2224
7501564,3,B002BFBAYW,"Someone mentioned this movie isn't predictable in an earlier review, which I really don't agree with.

It's more confusing than anything else, and the monster itself doesn't seem to have any set rules; it's supposed to be afraid of light, but approaches stretches of roads where there's abundant light, or vehicles with their headlights pointed directly at it. It also looks like the monster from the first Hellboy movie... just, y'know, with all the cool intricate details.

The acting is great, but the storyline seems pretty obviously designed to appeal to critics. It's more of a drama movie with the last half an hour focusing on a monster terrorizing a mother and daughter.",1485993600,2,679,5.0

7501567,3,B002BFBAYW,"The Actors were great and did a fine job delivering the dialog that had been written for them, the scenes were well shot, and the camera angles and lighting were well done. The story and monster costume were not great. If this movie had been about an immature alcoholic mother and her tragic/complex/abusive relationship with her tween daughter on a road trip to take the girl to live with her father, it would have been fine. The mother would then be the monster and that would have made more sense. The flashbacks to the events of life that lead them to take this drive seem completely disconnected, like it was from 2 different movies. The monster was an annoying distraction from what could have been a good story. The ending was anticlimactic and uninteresting.",1485993600,,766,4.723880597014926
7501568,4,B002BFBAYW,"A higher than average horror flick, and even better because it is not another ""Zombie"" movie.  No Zombies, real monsters, decent plot and the script and acting isn't moronic.  Suspenseful, subtle build up, and few of the common scary movie tricks, to make one just at something silly.  (A can jumping out...ahhh...hate that)  The special effects are very good, and realistic and the monster is excellently done, and gets good ""Air time"", so you get more than a fleeting glimpse of it.
  The creature reminds me of one I've seen before, but only saw short glimpses.
Overall, a good scary movie, worth watching, and if your like me ans sick and tired of Zombies of all sorts,  the ""Monster"" is a great change of pace, and a good scare too.",1485993600,,737,4.623076923076923

7501579,1,B002BFBAYW,"Overall, it was terrible. I couldn't get over the fact that the mother looked like the girl's sister, which made everything else hard to emotionally invest in. Yes there was a deeper message in this awful monster movie; however, the flashbacks they showed were disjointed from the story and felt as if they were from an entirely different film. I think it could have been a much better film if the monster actually turned out to be a metaphor for the behavior of the alcoholic mother. Yeah the girl says that there's different types of monsters, but still...a missed opportunity for doing something different and more creative. It's slow and pointless.

7501590,3,B002BFBAYW,"This one had too much time spent developing characters that are hard to like. I get the premise of the story, however horror stories work better when it is simply good vs evil.

I was more afraid of what additional horrible things the mother would do to the daughter rather than the big scary monster.",1485820800,2,474,4.710843373493976
7501591,3,B002BFBAYW,"Reminds me of ""The Babadook"" in that it's an apparent horror story where the monster turns out to be an allegory for an underlying family crisis or past tragedy.

This film would have been every bit as good, perhaps better, depicting the prototypical dysfunctional family played out through this mother, played by Zoe Kazan,& her daughter. To be sure, the (literal) monster added an unexpected dimension to what was already an engaging family drama. But for this viewer the monster was unnecessary & a distraction to the family dynamics portrayed so ably by these 2 young actresses. I give it 3 stars because the storyline would be better to focus on the dynamics of the love-hate tension of the mother-daughter relationship. The hate dimension of the tension proved to be rather the disappointment & frustration ubiquitous in human relationships. Their love for each other is true & deep. Life sacrificing.

This movie is worth seeing for the quality of the acting alone. Kudos to these 2 young women.",1485648000,,931,5.1655629139072845

7501671,3,B002BFBAYW,"I usually don't review horror monster movies, because usually they are beyond bad, very predictable, and not worth a review. This movie is the exception.

The story revolves around a dysfunctional family composed of an alcoholic mother and her emotionally scarred young daughter. The two spend most of their time screeching at each other like rabid raccoons. The acting was decent, but all the screaming came across as overemphasized annoying drama. The uncaring addict mother decides to get rid of her daughter for good by driving her across the state to her fathers. On a long trip through a stormy night they have a car accident in a wooded deserted area. There they meet a dysfunctional Monster with deep insecurities and a rare allergy to light. Let's call the Monster Ernie.

Spoiler Alert: Ernie the monster looks like the offspring of Ripleys Alien and Godzillas mentally challenged dwarf cousin. Ernie apparently is going through a identity crisis. At first Ernie the Monster tries to join the wolf pack but instead battles one to the death. But Ernie is lonely in the woods and decides to knock passing vehicles off the road so he can make new friends. Although unclear on this, Ernie apparently knocks the speeding two ton car of the mother and daughter off road and they run down a wounded wolf. Instead of getting out to see what the hell happened or if the animal is still alive, the mother and daughter sit in the car for what seems like hours and call 911 for help. Meanwhile, Ernie the monster is still pretty insecure and shy around humans, so he hides in the woods the whole time, not sure what to do.

The tow truck arrives hours before a speeding ambulance does (this makes total sense). The tow truck driver Jesse decides that the car needs extensive car repair before towing it. So while under their car trying to fix a broken axle with a screwdriver, Ernie decides its time to say hi and pulls the man out from under the truck and into the woods to mutilate him. The whole time this happens the Mother and daughter don't hear any screaming from Jesse or the loud snarls or growls from Ernie beneath the car they are sitting in. Feeling neglected, Ernie the monster is tired of being ignored and throws Jesses torn off bloody arm onto the car hood, but still stays hidden.

Now the mother and daughter decide it is time to be quiet so the monster doesnt hear them in the car; note this is after five minutes of honking the horn and screaming for Jesse to hurry up with the tow. But Ernies Alien instincts suddenly kick in and he breaks a car window and pulls the mother out of the car and munches down. Ernie apparently is highly sensitive to light, since the daughter defeats the monster with a 12 volt flashlight and saves her mother.

After the ambulance arrives, Ernie murders one of the paramedics and throws his dead body on the windshield, the other female paramedic decides to kick the windshield out with her dead partner on it. This is typical behavior, isn't it? Of course Ernie kills her also, but leaves the mother and daughter alone after another flashlight defeat.

So while the mother and her daughter take off in the ambulance to escape, Ernie out runs a 50 mph ambulance and knocks the three ton vehicle off the road causing it to roll a dozen times down into the woods, yet the electrical system and headlights are still working perfectly. Instead of staying hid in the well-lit wreckage until sunrise, the mother for no good reason decides to walk into the dark woods and sacrifice herself to Ernie, so her daughter can escape. She expects her daughter who is 30 feet away to outrun a monster in the woods that can outrun speeding vehicles. This is where you can see that the mother and daughter truly are related, because they both are very dumb. Afterwards, the daughter turns into baby MacGyver and creates a flame thrower out of a lighter and can of hair spray. It must have been some special napalm blend extra hold hair spray product only sold on the black market. The little girl lures Ernie into the truck with her talking teddy bear (once again, another very dumb plan). Here you can see that Ernie was abused as young monster tike, because he goes ballistic on the singing toy teddy for a full five minutes. Ernie and the girl are then face to face in the woods and Ernie appears to have a change of heart and wants to be friends with the little girl after devouring her mother, but the unforgiving girl sprays her homemade flame thrower at poor Ernie. Lucky for the little girl, Ernie is composed of gasoline soaked bed sheets and goes up like a haystack with the slightest flame (even in in a rain storm). Ernie the monster dies from the fire, but only after a cliche sudden last burst of energy and the 10 year old beats Ernie to death with a tree branch.
Having a non-CGI solid monster was a refreshing change, but when fully seen at the final scene, Ernie looked like a handicapped buck-teethed inbreed 80s monster reject.

Some people believe the monster was only metaphor for the little girls demons with a highly dysfunctional family, which would add depth to the movie. But I don't believe this is what was meant to be portrayed or maybe unclearly portrayed in a confusion of incoherent flashbacks.  This wasn't the worse monster movie made, but cheesey enough to write a humorous review about.",1485561600,12,5356,4.601047120418849

7501703,5,B002BFBAYW,"The Monster is not the typical horror. In fact, the 'horror' refers more to the tumultuous relationship between the young mother and her teenage daughter. Of course, there is a monster, but in a triple entendre form. There are three monsters: Monster #1) The Mom, Kathy, an alcoholic whose husband Roy has left her. She takes her anger out on her teenage daughter, Lizzy, mostly verbally. Watching her curse at her daughter is sad (the language is not for shock value but rather to show the mom's desperate nature) and you immediately feel for them both; Monster #2) The mother-daughter connection, a damaged and furious love; Monster #3) The monster in the woods who serves two purposes. It is first a literal monster, something like the one in Alien but more frightening in appearance. This is where the traditional horror comes into play. But it also serves as a symbol of the destructive nature of the mother-daughter kinship. Like the monster, it is bitter, ugly, horrifying, and ready to devour. The best part of this movie is that we see a real look at a daughter who just wants her mother's love and a mother who, due to her painful past, desires to reciprocate but is afraid to.  So this film doesn't depend on jump scares for the sake of horror but rather explores one of the most precious relationships of all--that between a mom and her daughter.",1485388800,,1358,4.705882352941177

7501705,3,B002BFBAYW,"This came across as a wasted effort to me. While it had its positive moments of tension, those would quickly be replaced with an absolutely ridiculous piece of dialogue or action that was completely absurd (not just ""I'm in a horror movie so I'm required to make bad decisions"" absurd, but rather awful script absurd).

First of all, I'd be hard pressed to find a more unlikable character than the mother - who looked like she was 17 and acted like she was 9. I do realize part of that was the point with the reversed roles of the mother/daughter. But this was just poured on far too heavy in every respect and that is just poor writing and direction. 15 minutes into the movie and we get it...mom is an alcoholic, chain-smoking loser who cares more about herself than her daughter. Did mom really sit in the car and make her daughter go out in the torrential downpour to get her cellphone from the tow truck? Really? And within seconds she says, ""I'm here for you baby...I'm right here."" Oh come on, who wrote this?

So, we have the most incompetent, unlikable mother. Then we're introduced to the single most incompetent tow truck driver in history. What exactly is the problem Jesse? Your only job is to connect a chain to the car, haul it in and drive away...and he's under the car for half an hour doing absolutely nothing. Just too many of these plot points make everything way too predictable and make it virtually impossible to even suspend disbelief enough to enjoy it.

Every line a cliche. Every action something to put a character in further jeopardy. A basic cop-out by the writers and director. Unfortunate because this could have been so much better and with a complete overhaul of the script it would have been.

Three stars because the little girl did an excellent job with the cliche lines and poor direction and there were enough successful tension-filled moments to avoid being a complete dumpster fire of a movie.

I don't want it to be a jigsaw puzzle for me to try and piece together. This film was not only a plethora of flashbacks, but one with a ton of loose ends. One reviewer surmised the monster was a metaphor for alcohol, but  there was no way. for it to truly be a metaphor, the mother would have to embrace or be entranced by the beast, but nothing of the sort occurred.

It seems like the director was trying to make this into something a little more than just a horror movie and it doesn't add anything. However, when the creature shows up it does get much better. The creature is pretty cool and its face looks a little Tim Burtonish with a big toothy grin, and those are some big teeth, mama. The creature walks like a gorilla at times and other times quick as a cat, and seems to be easily confused and occasionally seems to forget what he is supposed to do next. The bad thing is that the creature doesn't like light so the whole creature part is at night and hard to see. The other thing that I didn't like is that it is one of those movies in which the creature comes and then goes without any explanation as to what the heck is going on.

Most of the action takes place in the dark heightening the fear and impending danger. The acting was very good with good dialogue. This is not your typical mother-daughter relationship. They have issues. You get to know them by the flashbacks shown throughout the movie. Some of these scenes are painful to watch but are necessary for the story line. When faced with horrible circumstances, we tend to put all differences and shortcomings aside and bonding occurs. It is good to see their relationship evolve and mature as they try to survive. Be fore-warned some of the scenes are quite graphic including the ""monster"". But this is a very good suspenseful drama.",1485043200,2,763,4.922480620155039

This is pretty much a 2 actor play with a troubled mother and her beset daughter; road trip to stay with her dad and his new wife; car wreck in the middle of nowhere (but, there are street lights, go figure); and then there's a MONSTER. I think they might have been going for an allegory here, like in the Babadook, but it doesn't quite add up.

7501833,5,B002BFBAYW,"The Monster is a sincerely satisfying horror movie cut with glimpses into the damaged relationship between an alcoholic young mother and her disenchanted daughter.
Late at night, during a thunderstorm, the mother hits a wolf along an empty stretch of road while taking her daughter to live with her father. In a wound on the dead animal they find a tooth that's larger than one would expect from any natural predators. From there on out we have a wonderful creature-oriented horror flick.
The design of the monster itself is good, the acting is superb, the score is suitably somber, the character development (largely reinforced through the snippets showing us the relationship between mother and daughter) makes them people the viewer actually cares about, and the story pulls no punches once it gets going.
This movie belongs on the short list of the best movies of 2016, and not exclusively horror. It's not as impressive as The Autopsy of Jane Doe, but it isn't far behind...and it is certainly the best creature feature in a good long while.",1484956800,,1046,4.915254237288136

Unfortunately those are the only nice things I can say about this movie. The acting of the mother and daughter is generally atrocious and cringe worthy. There were a few moments where the daughter almost sold it, but those moments were rare. The writing/dialogue is filled to the brim with tired tropes and cliches and is at times completely illogical (seriously, why was everyone just getting out of the car and walking around in the rain at a snails pace?!). The cinematography was overly pretentious and you could tell who ever shot this movie was going for that edgy indy feel. And finally, the monster was very meh..

Some of the story is incredulous, there is some BAD cinematography, BAD editing and BAD lighting in many of the 'action sequences' (way too many lens flares for my taste) and a ham-handed soundtrack that sometimes gets in its own way.  What this movie has in SPADES is incredible COMMITMENT from its 2 actors, Zoe Kazan and Ella Ballantine who give fierce, withering, gut-wrenching performances every bit as intense and nuanced as Meryl Streep's in Sophie's Choice, or DiNero in Raging Bull or Brie Larson in Room.  There are boiling scenes of hatred, disgust, self-loathing, doubt, recrimination, abject debasement and cruelty, followed by forgiveness, sacrifice, redemption and salvation.  These 2 actors go where  no one ever goes in their most dire, desperate moments.  I wonder HOW they could have given these performances and reached past the emptying point of the human soul.  Way beyond mere terror, these woman played a toxic mother/daughter combination that laid bare the 1000 flaws that do damage to our psyches, and to those we love.  The scenes were so raw, so visceral,  one wonders how they got their emotions to work at this high level without putting themselves into unhealthy mental states.  Kudos to the director for letting the camera run and not calling cut because when lightning strikes you can't put it back in the bottle.

Bottom line:  If you are an ACTOR, or aspire to be one, and want to see a kind of performance that burns itself into your brain - you need to see this film.  . It will inspire you to draw deeper, commit more, infuse every nuance, every gesture, every phrase with LIFE OR DEATH importance, and with LOVE.

So, the synopsis is that a mother and daughter are on a deserted road, and stuck in their broke down car, and being stalked by a monster, right?  That's what I wanted to see.  And that's a very short lived part of this movie.

And if you're going to spend the time and money to make a movie about a Monster, call it The Monster, maybe spend a bit more on making the Monster look good.  I almost laughed out loud when I saw it.

For some reason, the bigger story here, is a broken relationship between an abusive, alcoholic mother and her daughter.  There are necessary flashbacks to how the mother acted around the daughter.  Maybe the writer was trying to get a double-meaning out of the title The Monster (the actual monster, and the alcoholic mother?)  I don't know.

7501922,5,B002BFBAYW,"A story about a girl and her terrible mother; not the kind of bad mother that we see in comedies, but the kind we see in real life. Throughout the movie, flashbacks give us glimpses of the sad relationship this mom and daughter have. The two survive a crash on a dark, lonely road. Then they have to survive being stalked by hideous, blood-thirsty creature. The creature represents what children fear- darkness, monsters. It represents what this girl fears- the darkness within her mother.
It's well made and well acted. The pair of actresses make their characters believable. I was appreciative of the use of lightning in the film. A pet peeve of mine is that so many movies (especially horror), that take place in the wilderness at night, are very well lit; as if there were five full moons in the sky. The Monster doesn't do this and does a great job of using only light that would be present in real life.

7501954,5,B002BFBAYW,"OMG these two young actresses are outstanding! Zoe Kazan, and Ella Ballentine should both get some kind of award for this performance. The then fourteen year old Ella was breath taking. I read the so called professional reviews on this movie and I have to tell you I really don't think they watched it. The N.Y. Times thought it was ""grindhouse"" ? and The N.Y. Daily said it had ""no originality"" IMDb gave it 5.3 out of 10. Variety was much more generous and gave it more of what it deserved. It is a strong horror story not unlike other rainy broke down on the road horror stories we've all seen but it has been given new meaning and maybe some undertow that you have to suss out to get the full appreciation of the story. Unlike most horror stories of this nature it is far more allegorical. Which make it more intelligent and deeper then some will understand. Those same qualities I think take the movie and the actors to the next level. Without that I would still have liked the film but not nearly as much. It is a Canadian movie shot on a small budget but not so small as to not have a professional look and feel to it. Beside the outstanding acting the writing and directing were awesome, the cinematography was great widescreen looked great. The editing never left you hanging or dragging, some jump scare that I knew would happen still made me jump. But back to Ella Ballentine, watch for her to become the next big thing she stole this movie and she has been in many movies since 2011 as well as stag and has a singing career too. Very impressive for a 15 year old she been nominated 5 time for acting Zoe has 5 wins and another 7 nominations. Somebody knew how to cast a movie.",1484352000,19,1688,4.344936708860759

7501957,3,B002BFBAYW,"The flaw inherent in most monster movies is that of underdeveloped characters stalked by a much more interesting central menace.  We rarely need (or want) to know more about the hapless victims, who, depending on the type of creature they're up against, serve no greater purpose than keeping up a body count.  But in The Monster (2016), the roles are reversed:  a pair of strongly written heroines fight for survival against a rather anonymous ""thing"" that, despite all its sound and fury, is most memorable in its irrelevance.

Lizzy (Ella Ballentine) is a self-sufficient pre-teen who grew up too fast thanks to her irresponsible, alcoholic mother, Kathy (Zoe Kazan).  But there's light at the end of the tunnel for their antagonistic and abusive relationship when Kathy agrees to drive her daughter to her father's house for an ""extended"" visit.  On the way, a car accident leaves them stranded on the side of the road during a late-night rainstorm...and leaves them at the mercy of an unidentified creature that cuts off every chance of escape.

It's amazing writer/director Bryan Bertino has only three films to his credit considering 2008's The Strangers was a financially successful, ingeniously restrained bit of modern-horror.  Regardless, The Monster shows he still has a light-touch with the camera and a skillful way with actors, particularly young Ella Ballentine, who garners our sympathy without resorting to child actor clichs.  Both she and Kazan deliver grown-up performances straight out of a Sundance-style emotional drama, never surrendering to the horror genre their characters happen to have stumbled upon.

And therein lies the problem with The Monster, a film that explores a tragic mother-daughter relationship with an affecting amount of honesty and skill...only to be rudely interrupted by an Alien knock-off hungry for human flesh.  The two halves simply don't fit.  Bertino does his best, injecting the first act with an impressive sense of impending doom and long, menacing takes.  But that script is writing checks his third act can't cash, saddling the audience with a makeshift monster (part H.R. Giger, part werewolf) that's in desperate need of a backstory.

Of course, the film has its sights set higher than delivering uncomplicated genre thrills.  Bertino's dramatic aspirations and metaphors are obvious but never insulting.  Still, his approach threatens to bore casual fans and alienate others.  The Monster proves, once again, that horror may very well be the most adaptable genre in the history of cinema.  But you have to be willing to put up with a few dead-ends on the evolutionary road.

Lionsgate's Blu-ray is a real visual stunner.  The ""look"" Bertino crafts for the film can't be complimented enough and the hi-def image pulls some incredible details out of the pitch-black photography.  Extras are limited to a single Eyes in the Darkness featurette.",1484352000,,2902,5.224622030237581

Close to the end the woman finally figures out what a monster she has been and decides to make it up to her, in her own crazy alcoholic way. The monster of the movie type is scary and deadly, but the girl figures out that she has to put fear aside (fear created by mommy dearest to begin with) and face life, in this case the monster, and use her intelligence to deal with it.

It's a monster movie for sure, but it's the dramatic and emotional elements between mother and daughter that drive this movie into heart-wrenching territory (and surprised me quite a bit). This is not your typical parent-protecting-child movie and The Monster's fractured storyline and character development deliver far more depth than the normal creature-feature.

I would have liked some more creative creature carnage, but on the whole, The Monster's emotionally draining narrative is what gives it real strength. The acting on both females' parts (mother and daughter) is incredible, blunt and quite simply, Oscar worthy.

Standard fair of darkness and fast movements keep us ""in the dark"" as to what we are looking at. It reminds one of the alien in the ALIEN movie franchise, nasty teeth and sort of slimy.

The many flash backs that developed the history between the mother and daughter was a interesting way to flesh out the characters and their troubled and tumultuous relationship. Gives some insight into how they arrived at this point in their lives and lays the ground work for why they find themselves in this place at this time.

After placing a 911 call after their ""accident"" it is amazing how long it takes for any sort of help to arrive and it arrives in a backwards order.  Tow truck first, ambulance a distant 2nd, and law enforcement never does  show up. As far as scares go it is pretty predictable. No real make you jump moments because you already know whats next.

7501983,5,B002BFBAYW,"The acting was excellent. The story very involved. SPOILER. It's only my opinion; however I believe the monster was a dream sequence. The child had a hideous childhood with her alcoholic mother and felt powerless to change things. She had feelings of rage so intense she almost murdered her mother with a butcher knife.  The hatred and animosity permeated the scenes that portrayed the relationship between mother and daughter. It was highly toxic. Almost at the end of the movie, right after she slays the monster and loses her fear; the scene switches to when she has awoken from a dream. Her mother was by her side upon waking and they spoke. The scene was oozing with motherly love and a crying daughter as they spoke about how they did not really hate each other and the love between the two was evident. So, I may be out of line and reading too much into the movie, but I believe the child had ""slain her dragon"" and that her ""monster"" ceased to exist when exposed to the light because the light represented the truth: the deep feelings of love that existed between the mother and daughter. Those feelings were buried deeply, but when faced with the ""monster"" that love was exposed when they tried to protect each other; even if it meant sacrificing their own lives in the process. Anyway, that's only my opinion.

The portrayal of the ""monster"" was fantastic. It looked like no monster I have ever seen before. It had to have been made of the same stuff that only nightmares are made of.

Very pleasantly surprised, the movie directed by  Bryan Bertino is an effective survival horror/monster feature. Its very slowly paced but builds to some gut wrenching suspense scenes, , character development, and an effective finale. Zoe Kazan and Ella Ballentine play a mother and daughter nearing the end of their relationship.

The first half of the movie sets up their distance relationship and their breakup as Zoes character is going to dump her off at a relative for the rest of her life. The movie develops her as a kill away character with few redeeming qualities while Ellas character plays the helpless child who gets stronger through the movie. Throw in a ravaging monster out for blood among these people, and anyone standing in its way, and it sets up a lot effective chills.

This is a well shot, written and acted monster movie, has a few slower moments, but over all its well done. It didn't blow my mind. But its a solid creature feature that is worth your time if you enjoy this type of horror.

Spoilers ahead!!!:
Alirght if you still reading you have been warned. Overall as a story, and its delivery, I give this movie a solid three stars. But I decided on four and here is why.
This movie is a allegory, but played out in realtime (within the movie), the monster is the mothers addiction, and the daughter's struggle and those whom are consumed by it.
Though why I gave it another star for this is that, it isn't played out in some long, convoluted cerebral story arch where half way threw the movie we get some pseudo-Jungian explanation of manifestations, and its actually the mother doing these things, and the little girl is seeing her as a monster because of the trauma. No there is a monster, completely separate of the main characters, and the allegory is there for all viewers to see, and t he characters nor the story is aware of it at any time. Case Closed.
It is refreshing to get this, now don't get me wrong, I love a good cerebral mind f&*k of a horror flick, some of my favorites. But it is nice for once, to get an allegory, which isn't written into the story itself. Nope, addict mom, abused child, and monster Rawr Rawr Rawr!, you as the viewer go Ahhhhh! after viewing it. and that's all. Nicely done.",1482883200,16,1466,4.389705882352941
7501989,4,B002BFBAYW,The relationship between mother and daughter is complicated and powerful. The actors are great. The script is pretty great. The effects are fine. But this movie kind of feels less focused towards the end. And the monster itself leaves seems less intimidating as the film goes on. I was tempted to give this three stars (despite the things I loved about it) but that wasn't giving it enough credit. The Monster was entertaining and it had the guts to do things I haven't seem a lot of movies do lately.,1482796800,,501,4.5777777777777775

7501991,2,B002BFBAYW,"This movie could have easily been 4 Stars.  But the climax just ruined it,  Spoilers:  The crappy abusive mother finally decides in order to save her daughter she must sacrifice her life (although not really).  Her daughter throws it all away with a petty decision and somehow manages to overpower, outsmart, and ultimately defeat the monster with a napalm-like, magic aerosol and a lighter.  Literally subduing/killing it with a brief flash burn and 10 year old girl-strength bludgeons to the shoulder.  Yes, the shoulder.  The movie was amazing until this part.  All I can say, if you can ignore the climax (I could not), it is a great horror film.

I mean Christ!  The mother finally made a selfless redeeming act and the movie threw it all away.  Then the daughter just decides to kill it.  And she haphazardly succeeds.  As it turns out, the monster is made of dry kindling even despite the constant rain.  Literally, it is so beyond realistic or even movie-realistic, it sucked me out of the story and I knew I had to write this.  I do not do reviews.

If the movie was re-cut with a different ending, I would watch it again.  It is well done through the first 2 acts.  Flashbacks are great without being burdensome or unnecessary like most films.

SOMETHING extraordinary HAPPENS IN THIS VID...As the movie plays out, you begin to realize how good Miss Kazan, and Miss Ballentine's performances really are! A lonely stretch of dark forest road is the set. Turn on the  rain (a downpour that lasts through most of the movie) It's pitch black (THE LIGHTING AND CAMERA SHOTS MADE you start getting spooked, and totally hooked right off the bat. The scenes,. filmed in the headlights of other vehicles...contrasted with the absolutely Black-hole of darkness, just a few feet past the forest edge...These things make THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT BEING A CORNY SLASHER, AND BEING...WELL...FREAKING GOOD!

SUMMARY. NO SPOILERS:

The dark. The shimmery wet road...ceepy woods, the fog and rain...and two young ladies are in for a terrible ordeal. Those two REALLY KNOW HOW TO ACT ! I'm serious!, heck they had me scared waiting for this scary as HELL, creepy MONSTER WITH TEETH LIKE JAWS, to snatch the next victim. You don't ever get a really good look at this thing. The camera work made that shadowy beast, with all those teeth, look freaking spooky, Scooby doo! It's.probably a big suit,..made of neoprene, slime and rubber. A moulded creature suit)...whatever it was, it kept scaring the hell out of me! Jumping and snatching. You know, one of those.......waaaaait foooooor it....(Then)...BOOO!!! Heartattack!

This movie was really good in that the story was strong, the characters were well written, the monster was different and the tone of the movie was perfect. The actors were really good especially the daughter, she loved her mom so much no matter how bad of a mom she was. The fact that it was just the two of them facing their fears together made their bond stronger and at the end, it was sad to see what happens.

The creature was different but it reminded me of the monster in the movie ""Animal"". Other than that, the monster design was pretty kool. I would definitely recommend this movie to others.",1480896000,,726,4.291970802919708
7502010,3,B002BFBAYW,"This story is actually set up really well; you're introduced to the mother & her daughter, & through the opening scene as well as via flashbacks we get a good insight as to their shaky (bordering on neglect/abuse) relationship before we start out with them on a road trip to hell.

The suspense & dread build as they find themselves broken down on the side of the road...very late at night...& Mom finds out there's something far worse creeping up on her besides a jonesing for her next cigarette.

Two mistakes that very nearly kill the last 1/2 of the movie...the ""monster"" should have been kept in the shadows or otherwise concealed enough so that we don't go ""Hey!  What's that man doing running around in the woods, wearing that wolf-slash-gooey monitor lizard costume?!?""

(Won't go into the Jurassic Park sound effects they gave the ""monster."")

It was so much more effective when we were seeing shadowy bits & pieces of it in the dark.

Mistake # 2....this movie begs for a different ending, or at least one more realistic.  The white trash ""I got knocked up over Wild Turkey & 305's"" mother should have gone out in all of her skanky ho glory.  The sudden turnaround to a ""I'' gonna sacrifice myself for the life of this kid that I can't stand"" is unbelieveable & falls flat.",1480809600,,1283,4.5964912280701755

7502012,1,B002BFBAYW,"When I read the premise of this movie I thought it sounded really different with much potential but I was so wrong.  I will say the acting is pretty strong and the two leads are decent enough that is the movies strongest catch pretty much everything else is downside where I come from.  The movie is about a mother and daughter and the mother has severe addiction issues and a rocky relationship with her daughter.  Neither one of them likes each other very much and there is no trust or love really, the daughter is more like the mother figure and vice versa.
The are traveling to see the girls father as he is now going to have custody when low and behold the car breaks down on a practically deserted road that no one uses anymore in the pouring rain while its pitch black out (stop me if you have seen this before).  After a freak accident involving a wolf they wait for an ambulance and a tow truck to show up and that is where slowly we meet the Monster.  The monster for most of the movie is dark and slimy and looks oddly shaped kind of a cross between a man in a suit and well... the prop department did not know what kind of monster they wanted.  When we finally see the monster it is more dinosaur than monster more teeth than anything, oddly shaped and not all that scary really.  The  Mother and Daughter fight to survive in the woods being hunted by the monster/dinosaur thing and that is about it.

This movie is neither scary nor unpredictable every time you think your going to see the monster you do, anytime you think someone is going to die they do...and by the time you get a full glimpse of the monster itself in all its glory the movie will have been a waste of time.  Like I said above I do appreciate the acting of the two main characters they tried their best but could not save this monster of a movie.",1480377600,8,1829,4.244956772334294

My real takeaway from the movie is how the daughter must deal with her young mother's considerable issues, come to some sort of terms with them, and eventually emerge stronger as a person at the end (I'm not in film school, but I thought the last shot of the movie illustrated this well).

All of this occurs during a typical 'car breaks down on desolate road with creepy critter stalking them' setup. Really, my only qualm with the flick is that I wished they had spent more bucks on the monster suit or shown less of it. It looks a bit like one of H.R. Geiger's aliens had a one night stand with a gorilla.

Try to suffer through the guy in a rubber monster suit and focus on the past and present relationship the mother and daughter go through. That's the real meat and potatoes of this movie.",1480204800,2,1038,4.373056994818653

7502022,4,B002BFBAYW,"I enjoyed this movie for the most part. While the title is called ""The Monster"", and it certainly does indeed, have a rather horrifying one, it is actually about more than just that.  In a way, I kind of wonder if it was meant more than just referring to the creature, but also to the horrible relationships within the family.  While on the one hand, it shows the girl as being in a very abusive family situation, on the other hand, there was real love there too, at least between the girl and her mother, even though she was mostly treated like crap. The girl often gave as good as she got, but no way should a mother talk to their young child like that in the first place.  As the story progresses, we come to learn more about the family situation, and that it wasn't entirely all that it may have seemed in the beginning,  there were some genuinely frightening and suspenseful scenes between everyone in those highway scenes and the creature for monster movie lovers, although maybe not quite enough if that is what you're only interested in. I'm a big monster movie fan, and I found myself surprisingly enjoying this movie despite the fact that it wasn't entirely about a monster, but that last half hour or so was mostly all monster.  Although the daughter was kind of a bit too whiny throughout most of the movie, one can sort of understand that, due to the total disfunction in her family. Some of those family scenes are brutal, the acting in this movie was really great, and kudos to the actors playing mother and daughter, especially because many of the scenes between them are so intense and so gut- wrenching, it kind of takes your breath away.

7502028,3,B002BFBAYW,"Warning: possible spoilers

This is more of an indie drama with a monster than an actual horror movie.  Zoe Kazan (Ruby Sparks) plays Kathy, an alcoholic and irresponsible mother to her way too old for her young age daughter Lizzy (Ella Ballentine).  They set off on a drive where Kathy is taking Lizzy to visit her father--likely for good.  The first half hour is largely flashbacks along the drive that establish why Kathy is giving up her daughter but also the loving bond that exists between the mother and daughter, even though the mom frequently doesn't deserve it.

The indie drama approach has the plus of creating much more three dimensional, realistically shaded characters than you would normally see in a film of this type.  Some of the scenes between mother and daughter are genuinely heart-wrenching.  The downside to this approach is that horror fans will likely be bored.  It takes a full half hour before anything approaching a suspense sequence to finally turn up in the film and even longer for the monster to actually show itself.

This wouldn't necessarily be a fatal problem except for the fact that the filmmakers maintain the more grounded and realistic approach to the material even after the monster starts to attack.  This largely precludes the kind of visceral thrills that one wants and expects from a monster movie.  I wanted the mom to go all Ripley from Aliens on the monster and find her inner mama bear, redeeming herself in the process.  What the movie actually delivers is both far more realistic and infinitely less satisfying.

The monster itself actually looks excellent but it's largely wasted on a movie like this that is less interested in delivering thrills than in exploring the character journies mother and daughter each take when confronted with a real flesh and blood monster.  The mother is given the short shrift in my opinion, especially as she is played by the wonderful Zoe Kazan who finds more humanity and compassion in her character that probably was there on the page--there aren't a lot of actresses who could actually make a character this unsympathetic likable.  But for whatever reason, daughter Lizzy is the hero of this story.  She is played with both aching vulnerability and steely resolve by the excellent Ella Ballentine, but I still think the narrative choice to ultimately turn the movie into a showdown between the child and monster was a major miscalculation on the part of the filmmakers.  For that to have worked, the mother would have needed to be a monster herself but she ends up so humanized and sympathetic and desperately in need of redemption that it ends up feeling like an almost perversely bad narrative choice to completely sideline her long before the finale like the film does.

The Monster might please some people looking for a more thoughtful and realistic approach to horror--fans of The Witch, for instance, might be a perfect fit for this film.  But people looking for thrills and scares are likely to be disappointed as the drama/horror balance never quite gels, resulting in a movie many horror fans will find slow and unsatisfying, despite stellar performances from both lead actresses and excellent creature work.",1479427200,6,3209,4.942271880819367

A wolf stands in the road, there's a bad accident, and they are stuck on a lonely road, in the center of dark woods. They are injured, but able to walk, and take a look at a dead wolf in the road. Daughter notices and extracts a very large fang from the dead wolf.
They do get help from a man in a tow truck, but what I didn't understand is why he didn't put them in the truck and drive them to safety. Ah, well. So while he's working to hook the car to the truck(there are complications that put him under the truck), he disappears. When his severed arm is tossed on the hood of the car, we get the usual screams, and holding on to each other, and then comes the bonding, and the monster.

Bryan Bertino's The Monster is no exception and, in my mind, sets a new standard in its genre.  Instead of relying on jump scares and gratuitous gore, the focus is on the tragic tale of a mother and daughter, told through gritty, authentic, and heartbreaking flashbacks.  It is a horror movie that transcends its peers, frightening audiences by having them face the terror of personal demons, which are far more fearsome than even the stunningly fashioned abomination that hunts this minimal cast.  Using inspired cinematography, a chilling soundtrack, and superior performances, The Monster, doesn't just scare us, it makes us feel; connecting with the characters on an exclusive level no matter the extent of their screen time.  With genuine dialogue and interactions, you experience every word as if spoken directly to you.  The only minus, a bit too much unnecessary profanity in an otherwise stellar script. This is what modern filmmaking was meant to be; effects eclipsed by a simple, well-told story. Unpredictable to the very last second, this is a journey into what truly haunts who we are and the monsters that exist from within and without.",1479254400,2,1334,5.124423963133641

8738860,4,B002BFBAYW,"This was a good horror film, I rather enjoyed it. The premise, while simple, definitely held my attention with good scares, atmosphere, and the tremendous skill of the two leads. There were, as many critics and reviewers pointed out, more depth to the film than a simple monster flick, as the relationship between the two leads figured a lot into the plot.

Taking place almost entirely on a dark, rainy road deep in the forest, the movie centers on a mother (an abusive, alcoholic woman by the name of Kathy played by Zoe Kazan) and her daughter, choosing to permanently live with her father (the daughter is 10-years old and named Lizzy, played by Ella Ballentine). While driving her daughter through the forest, Kathy hits a wolf. Kathy is injured in the collision and the car damaged and the two managed to call an ambulance and a tow truck.

Things get worse from there, for in the dark rainy woods there is a far worse thing a wolf, and soon everyone involved is in a fight for their lives (with multiple people dying). To say much more is spoiling, but the fight against the monster also involves repairing the relationship between Kathy and Lizzy.

I liked the monster, the atmosphere and tension were first rate, and Zoe Kazan and Ella Ballentine did excellent jobs (especially Ella); if they had not been good the movie wouldnt have worked anywhere near as well as it did. It was literally and figuratively a dark film and in both senses of the word really worked for me. Watch it in a darkened room if you can!

8738862,1,B002BFBAYW,"There's not much to say about this flick except that it is unoriginal, slow, and predictable.  Certainly Not something that keep you on the edge of your seat.  On the contrary, I found myself skipping ahead - and knowing exactly what I would've missed - jus to get through it.  Very generic horror movie :(",1534809600,,306,4.527272727272727
8738863,1,B002BFBAYW,"How does this movie fail to meet the most elementary of standards? Oh, there are so many ways. First let me say that any movie that relies on two 15-watt bulbs for all the lighting is, de facto, intensely annoying. Even in the interior flashback scenes, aside from the long, long pitch-black rainy night during which  most of the action takes place, the two characters appear to live in near-darkness. Apparently the film-making community is convinced that the less light used--think low-watt lighting that mysteriously radiates no ambient light at all but merely a narrow cone of harsh white light--the greater the artistic depth. Wrong. Failure of characters to turn on the lights when it gets dark and instead live out their work and home lives in near-darkness simply makes for an annoying film; it's a signal, generally, that the script and/or the acting is too dim to evoke emotion but needs a signal: See, audience! This is a dark/scary/depressing movie! Not unlike musical clues--here's when to feel sentimental; here's when to be frightened; here's when to relax. (I think the most egregious example of how film music can be used to dictate audiences' emotions is in the film, ""Glory."" That movie can be reduced to one question: Are the black troops in the Civil War going to be recognized and given a measure of respect? Well, you don't have to actually watch the  movie to know if they get their uniforms or not--the music pre-empts the action. Before the camera can slowly pan to the sight of the troops with their uniforms, the orchestra has already told you the answer.)
At any rate, ""The Monster"" is a succession of long, repeated close-ups of the daughter,'s face, endless drawing out of minor action interspersed with loud music, growling, screaming and here and there a blinding headlight or flashlight.
The ""monster"" is the crudest sort of puppet, the kind you make from a few paper bags and black paint.
The thin, hackneyed plot--a terrible, drunk, cruel, selfish mother whose daughter is nevertheless kind and forgiving and brave--has the expected end: all is forgiven, oh mommy oh mommy.
The young actress who plays the daughter, Canadian Ella Ballentine, does a fine job; even if the plot is absurd, she is not. She is capable of much more, as her history shows. Perhaps this film, ""The Monster,"" is just a mistake.",1534809600,,2338,4.871859296482412
8738864,2,B002BFBAYW,"2/5.  This movie was more built around the tension between the mother and daughter than the monster.  That would be fine if the actors or the writers were any good.
To the film makers credit the monster is neither good or bad appearance wise.",1534723200,,242,4.4772727272727275

8738866,4,B002BFBAYW,"The movie had a good storyline, but the pacing seemed off to me, and the monster wasn't super well done. Overall its worth a watch, but nothing to go nuts over.",1533427200,,160,4.193548387096774
