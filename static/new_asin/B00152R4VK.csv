3138702,5,B00152R4VK,"I only watched the early part of Dark Angel's first season when it aired, but I really enjoyed it. It's rare to find two seasons of television together at this price, so I picked it up hoping I would enjoy the rest as much. I sure did! Dark Angel was a great show! The two seasons are rather different, but run together well to make the whole series. They also set up a world that would have enjoyed watching for many seasons after this. The second season finale, amazingly, manages to function well as a series ender, too - providing the right amount of closure and wrap up but leaving us loose ends to keep thinking about (since we can't pick them up again!).
  Interesting, Fox opted to drop Dark Angel's third season in favor of Joss Whedon's Firefly - another exceptional show, which the network treated horribly and lost way too early.",1220918400,3,841,4.490196078431373
3138703,5,B00152R4VK,"I didn't watch this show when it was on t.v.  I thought it would be stupid, just for kids type of show.
I loved it!!!
I only hope our world never gets in this shape.",1220745600,,165,3.7142857142857144
3138704,4,B00152R4VK,"We have all seen a few episodes when the series first come out on TV but when the broadcasts were cut, I wanted to know what happened next? Dark Angel shows Jessica Alba (Max) as a genetically engineered solider who escapes with her sector and keeps on the run from Manticore. Season 2 broadens the plotline by adding amazing make-up art for the creatures and powers that those who appreciate in Heroes will envy. It is a shame that season 3 did not happen...",1220400000,,459,4.476190476190476
3138705,5,B00152R4VK,"I just wanted to let evryone know that i just order'ed this same set, and recieved it all good, and it is indeed BOTH seasons(12 disc's) of Dark Angel. like the other review states this is your best buy, unless for whatever reason you only want one af the seasons. i also only paid 32.00 for it (through Amazon), and i see that they have raised the price. still a steal at 45.00 for both, but if your thinking about getting this set, do so before the price gets raised again. i hope this helps!!",1219104000,25,495,4.221052631578948
3138706,5,B00152R4VK,Everything came in new condition and was like I just purchased it out of a retail store.  Great shows!  Too bad they canceled it in its prime.,1218758400,2,142,4.222222222222222
3138707,5,B00152R4VK,"I wasn't sure what to expect as apparently I missed out on the series when it aired in Australia a few years back. Originally I was in two minds whether to buy the set or not and was only looking at it because Jensen Ackles was in it. Then I saw that Michael Weatherly was one of the lead characters with Jessica Alba and decided to purchase both seasons. I was not disappointed at all. The first season set up the big picture of genetically altered humans and followed through on Max's journey to find out who she was. The writers didn't deviate from the 'plan' in season one at all and there wasn't an episode that I didn't like. Season Two mainly concentrated on the transgenics which were released from Manticore and to the main cast added Joshua (Kevin Durand) and Alec (Jensen Ackles). Just loved the way that each episode panned out with a special story about some of the 'mutant' transgenics. Once again the writers stuck to the 'plan' and mainly concentrated on the transgenics story and once again I was not disappointed by any episode. The finale was excellently done by the writers. I would recommend this TV Show to anyone who likes a bit of sci-fi. Some people didn't like it, but mostly I just couldn't stop watching the series until I had finished it.",1216080000,99,1267,4.51304347826087
3138718,5,B00152R4VK,great show but would love to see it on Blu-ray and widescreen,1508544000,,61,4.166666666666667

3138721,4,B00152R4VK,"For a couple years at the turn of the millennium, James Cameron channeled his inner Joss Whedon, and Dark Angel was the result. More seriously, Dark Angel is not entirely out of line with Cameron's earlier work and stands on its own despite thematic similarities to shows like Buffy. For one thing, despite a fair amount of goofiness, it's not a comedy. It draws on concerns of its time to develop a reasonably compelling soon-to-be-no-longer-near-future setting steeped in economic and technological anxiety. While not exemplary, the show is fun and quite watchable (bingeable, even!), and it would have been interesting to see how things would have unfolded given more time.",1501804800,,676,5.154545454545454
3138722,4,B00152R4VK,"Dark Angel was one of my favorite series ever!  James Cameron directed it, so how could it not be could!  My son like this show too, as much as I did, so I gave these to him after I watched the entire series on these DVDs.  I just wish the quality of the appearance of the show on the DVD could have been better.  I remember that the series was dark and gloomy, but I wish the DVDs could have been a little more sharp and clear.  Anyway, it was an excellent show with great actors, including the stars:  Michael Weatherly and Jessica Alba!",1500940800,,539,4.134615384615385

3138792,4,B00152R4VK,"I actually enjoyed the second season.  Even more than the first.  But the second season was also the show's demise.  The highlights were huge, but there was so much that lent to the show's failure.

The introduction of new characters, especially Alec, played by the very charismatic, very handsome Jensen Ackles, elevated the series.  There seemed to be meaning through all the chaos, but despite the breakthrough, the show was determined to fail.

I really didn't care for Asha/Ashley Scott, who was a competing love interest but had none of Jessica Alba's charisma.  She didn't compete.  She was just there.  And not once did I care for her.  I didn't think her formidable or even intelligent.  Worse, I didn't even think her earnest.  And it isn't because of the actress - it was just because the character was very poorly written.

I didn't care for Joshua.  I actually blame him for the show's demise.  I just hated him though I felt sorry for him.  He was fumbling and bumbling, and he slowed down the whole show's pace.  Jessica Alba tried too hard to pretend she liked him, but she didn't, and the character couldn't give us a reason for all his screen time.  He was awkward from the start, and he lacked chemistry with all the characters.  His salvation was the central downfall of the series.

Logan's disease was so boring.  He was weak already.  I just didn't care about him.  There was never any tension.  It was Max/Jessica Alba all along.

I LOVED the series, but I just wish the show had not veered so dramatically off course.  Alec/Jensen Ackles and even Ames White/Martin Cummins are dramatic great additions, but the show also was schmaltzy, sentimental, and even stupid at times.  Max tried too hard.  And I understand why the show was cancelled.",1448841600,,1766,4.720394736842105

So decided to buy the WHOLE SERIES from my most favorite store - Amazon.  I expected to get the COMPLETE series from beginning to end BUT the picture you see here is NOT what I received!!! We started watching the 1st disc last night and it did NOT start at the BEGINNING of the show....we did NOT get to see when she was in Manicore, when she escaped, how she was picked up by the lady from Manicore. It was a BIG JUMBLED MESS as we watched it. While watching, there were several times where the screen went to BLACK, as if it was going to a ""commercial"" like it was/is on TV. I am terrrbly disappointed with the 2 discs I received - as if I had been ""jipped"" from the ""COMPLETE SERIES"" and got stuck with 1 disc from each season.

3138885,4,B00152R4VK,"Overall the series was very good.  By now most people will know at least some of the story. Jessica Alba's character (Max) was raised as a super soldier in a government program called Manticore.  A group of them escaped as children and scattered.  After the US was hit with an electromagnetic pulse and set back years, and technology was available only to the very rich and martial law was imposed it became easier for them to hide and blend in.  Max has a job as a bike messenger by day and a cat burglar by night.  She eventually becomes a vigilante working with Michael Weatherly's character Logan to fight corruption and injustice in exchange for finding out about her past and the fate of her ""siblings"" who escaped with her.

There were a lot of twists and turns in the story, but what I liked about season one is that they stuck to the classified military program, expanded into cloning and the fact that all the soldiers had ""twins"" (sometimes multiple twins).  In the second season they expanded the story to have human/animal hybrids and got into secret societies that just got a little weird and took the story on a tangent I don't think they needed to go.

I think the highlight of the show was the acting and writing.  All the actors, from the main cast to the more ancillary characters, played their characters well.  Jensen Ackles particularly did a great job as Ben/Alec when he was brought on a series regular in season 2.  Ultimately I think it was a show that Fox killed off too soon.  I think even with the weird tangents that the show went on in season 2, there was still room to tell compelling stories.  All in all, it was a very good series with a lot of action, drama and even some comedy. It is definitely not a show that will appeal to everyone's taste, but if you like action series give it a try.",1359158400,,1825,4.42814371257485

3138912,5,B00152R4VK,"I just want to give people a heads up.  This version is NOT widescreen.
If you have a widescreen TV, you should head over to Amazon.uk and order
the PAL (European) version.  It's encoded in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen
format.  The only downside is, you will need to play it back on a PAL-compatible DVD player or
hook your computer up to your TV, as all computers can play back PAL or NTSC.
It's a shame FOX gave us NTSC (American) viewers this cropped 4:3 version.
The version from Amazon.uk cost the same as this even with shipping, and took two
weeks to get here.
Hope this helps someone.
I'm still giving this 5 stars, because it's a wonderful show in any format.
Alba's best work by far, and she's in every frame, so it's a must buy for her fans.

3138919,5,B00152R4VK,"Let's be real. While Fox has had alot of great series like The Simpsons, Family Guy, and MadTv, they've been notorious for killing shows long before their time. Dark Angel was one of them. I was a really big fan of the show from jump. I was 13 at the time and not a sci-fi fan in the least, but something about how well the show flowed and the characters drew my attention kept me hooked.

Jessica Alba starred as Max Guevara, a genetically enhanced (as in not a cyborg or any other type of machine) girl who escaped from a secret government owned and run breeding/super-soldier training institution called Manticore. Max (X5-452) was apart of the X-5 series (previous X series were unsuccessful) and along with her ""brothers and sisters"" (other X-5 kids) were exposed to nightmarish experiments and brutal warfare training, but eventually made the decision to run away. The first 5 minutes or so of the pilot episode chronicles their great escape. Max and eleven of her siblings succesfully escape, but are all separated. A few months later, a terrorist activated electromagnetic pulse (simply called The Pulse) hits and turns the US into virtually a third world country. All technology is destroyed and chaos abounds. Because of this, Max is able to slip into the real world unnoticed.

The rest of the show picks up ten years later and Max is living in Seattle working as a bike messenger at Jam Pony. She enjoys being a regular girl and chillin' with her friends. Her best friend is the always sassy, ""tell it like it is"" black lesbian Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller). Cindy has always got her back and some of the funniest lines in the series. Max squats with another close girlfriend named Kendra (Jennifer Blanc) who is quite hetero and always on the prowl. Her other two friends are the stoner with a heart of gold Sketchy (Richard Gunn) and the always optimistic Jamacian mon Herbal Thought (Alimi Ballard). Her very conservative and always grouchy boss Reagan Ronald aka Normal (he is the most normal out of the group hence the nickname) is always on her back with some snarky lines.

While Max's daytime life may seem normal, her nighttime activities are anything but. She's a cat burglar in order to pay off the very expensive funds that will help her track down her missing brothers and sisters. One night, after breaking into the apartment of Logan Cale (Michael Waverley), she's caught by the man of the house himself and the two soon strike up a business relationship. Apparently, Logan did his research and found out about Max's Manticore past. The barcode on the back of her neck was a dead giveaway (did I mention the barcode?). In exchange for helping Max find her siblings, she has to help Logan solve his mysteries. See, Logan is really the cyber journalist ""Eyes Only"" who hacks into cable feeds to spread ""the truths"" of the corrupt political society of not only Seattle, but America in under 60 seconds. Max agrees and the first season officially begins.

Oh yeah, Logan also has to protect Max from Lydecker (John Savage), her former Manticore trainer. He's been searching for ""the kids"" as he calls them for all the ten years they've been gone and he'll stop at nothing to get them back. To give a quick runthrough of the first season, a love affair ensues between Logan and Max (you so knew that was gonna happen), Max is able to find some of her siblings, and she manages to confront Lydecker (he's one cold dude) and try to take down Manticore in one of the best finales in tv show history. Well, to me anyway. Pretty awesome stuff. Now onto season 2.

Season 2 is alot different from the first. Without giving the season one finale away, Max ends up back at Manticore, but doesn't stay put for long. She escapes after taking the prison (that's basically what it was) down and releases all of the imprisoned transgenics. About that, not all of the ""gennies"" are quite human. Max has a bit of cat DNA herself (the episodes where she goes into heat are hilarious), but she still has a human appearance. The older ones, not so much. See, they were given too much animal DNA in their genetic cocktails so they possess more cross breed appearances. Like Joshua (Kevin Durand), Max's friend and adoptive brother. He was the first transgenic Manticore ever created and has a human body with a dog face. Still a sweetheart though.

 Anyway, all the gennies are freed and manage to escape into society. The ""regular"" folks freak out and new villian Ames White (Martin Cummins) is called upon by the government to cover up the Manticore crimes by exterminating them. Needless to say, Max is on the top of his list. She feels it's her job to protect her transgenic siblings while laying low as best she can herself. Her relationship with Logan becomes complicated too. While back at Manticore, the bad guys figured out Max was in cahoots with Eyes Only (they still don't know he's Logan) and infect her with a virus that will kill him on skin to skin contact. The two try their best to keep their romance going, but Logan's new assistant Asha (Ashley Scott) tends to get in the way as well.

Another new character is fellow X-5er Alec (Jensen Ackles). Max meets him back at Manticore and the two form a love/hate sibling-like relationship. Alec (as in smart aleck) is a nice guy overall, but always looking out for himself and constantly on the look out for some get rich scheme. Sweet, but not too smart since he manages to get himself in trouble alot. Original Cindy, Sketchy, and Normal also return, but there's no mention of Kendra or Herbal Thought. Where'd the hell they go? Beats me. Anyway, the second season does border on a ""transgenic of the week"" feel, but it has a powerful ""people fear and hate what they don't understand"" message that's relatable to all people. The second season finale is awesome too, although there are a couple of storylines that don't get completely wrapped up.

To wrap it all up, The best thing about Max is that she walks a fine line between a hard ass and being vulnerable. She's not at all a girly girl, but she's also not afraid to let her feelings be known. If she's sad, she'll let it out without being dramatic and with all she's been through, can you really blame her? She's also witty and a smartass. While the show did end too soon, it had a great run with no boring episodes ever. Pick it up!

What made season 1 so interesting was it's focus on Alba's character negotiating between two very different identities and trying to live a ""normal"" life despite being anything but.

Season 2 has aspects of this, but focuses far too heavily on gimmicks like extraterrestrials and bio-mutations. It was far more convincing and powerful when it stayed focused on trying to keep things closer to reality.

I would say that if you've any interest in scifi, Season 1 is definitely worth watching. Season 2 is still watchable and interesting, but it loses a lot of steam. I'd only get it if you're a hardcore fan.",1221609600,,764,4.816793893129771

Originally I was in two minds whether to buy the set or not and was only looking at it because Jensen Ackles was in it. Then I saw that Michael Weatherly was one of the lead characters with Jessica Alba and decided to purchase both seasons. I was not disappointed at all. The first season set up the big picture of genetically altered humans and followed through on Max's journey to find out who she was. The writers didn't deviate from the 'plan' in season one at all and there wasn't an episode that I didn't like. Season Two mainly concentrated on the transgenics which were released from Manticore and to the main cast added Joshua (Kevin Durand) and Alec (Jensen Ackles). Just loved the way that each episode panned out with a special story about some of the 'mutant' transgenics. Once again the writers stuck to the 'plan' and mainly concentrated on the transgenics story and once again I was not disappointed by any episode. The finale was excellently done by the writers. I would recommend this TV Show to anyone who likes a bit of sci-fi. Some people didn't like it, but mostly I just couldn't stop watching the series until I had finished it.",1216080000,99,1267,4.51304347826087

3373218,4,B00152R4VK,"For a couple years at the turn of the millennium, James Cameron channeled his inner Joss Whedon, and Dark Angel was the result. More seriously, Dark Angel is not entirely out of line with Cameron's earlier work and stands on its own despite thematic similarities to shows like Buffy. For one thing, despite a fair amount of goofiness, it's not a comedy. It draws on concerns of its time to develop a reasonably compelling soon-to-be-no-longer-near-future setting steeped in economic and technological anxiety. While not exemplary, the show is fun and quite watchable (bingeable, even!), and it would have been interesting to see how things would have unfolded given more time.",1501804800,,676,5.154545454545454

My son like this show too, as much as I did, so I gave these to him after I watched the entire series on these DVDs.  I just wish the quality of the appearance of the show on the DVD could have been better.  I remember that the series was dark and gloomy, but I wish the DVDs could have been a little more sharp and clear.

3373289,4,B00152R4VK,"I actually enjoyed the second season.  Even more than the first.  But the second season was also the show's demise.  The highlights were huge, but there was so much that lent to the show's failure.

The introduction of new characters, especially Alec, played by the very charismatic, very handsome Jensen Ackles, elevated the series.  There seemed to be meaning through all the chaos, but despite the breakthrough, the show was determined to fail.

I really didn't care for Asha/Ashley Scott, who was a competing love interest but had none of Jessica Alba's charisma.  She didn't compete.  She was just there.  And not once did I care for her.  I didn't think her formidable or even intelligent.  Worse, I didn't even think her earnest.  And it isn't because of the actress - it was just because the character was very poorly written.

I didn't care for Joshua.  I actually blame him for the show's demise.  I just hated him though I felt sorry for him.  He was fumbling and bumbling, and he slowed down the whole show's pace.  Jessica Alba tried too hard to pretend she liked him, but she didn't, and the character couldn't give us a reason for all his screen time.  He was awkward from the start, and he lacked chemistry with all the characters.  His salvation was the central downfall of the series.

Logan's disease was so boring.  He was weak already.  I just didn't care about him.  There was never any tension.  It was Max/Jessica Alba all along.

I LOVED the series, but I just wish the show had not veered so dramatically off course.  Alec/Jensen Ackles and even Ames White/Martin Cummins are dramatic great additions, but the show also was schmaltzy, sentimental, and even stupid at times.  Max tried too hard.  And I understand why the show was cancelled.",1448841600,,1766,4.720394736842105

I have both, bought long ago in 1.33 to 1 (4:3). I was wondering if widescreen versions were available, but the aspect ratio is not specified here. This has been a reliability-of-information issue with many of Amazon's video products. I see the individual seasons at 4:3 for about $15 each, and then this pair for $45. Is the extra money for something or not? Anyone buy this set and know if it is 4:3 or 16:9 ?",1371772800,2,587,4.444444444444445

3373382,4,B00152R4VK,"Overall the series was very good.  By now most people will know at least some of the story. Jessica Alba's character (Max) was raised as a super soldier in a government program called Manticore.  A group of them escaped as children and scattered.  After the US was hit with an electromagnetic pulse and set back years, and technology was available only to the very rich and martial law was imposed it became easier for them to hide and blend in.  Max has a job as a bike messenger by day and a cat burglar by night.  She eventually becomes a vigilante working with Michael Weatherly's character Logan to fight corruption and injustice in exchange for finding out about her past and the fate of her ""siblings"" who escaped with her.

There were a lot of twists and turns in the story, but what I liked about season one is that they stuck to the classified military program, expanded into cloning and the fact that all the soldiers had ""twins"" (sometimes multiple twins).  In the second season they expanded the story to have human/animal hybrids and got into secret societies that just got a little weird and took the story on a tangent I don't think they needed to go.

I think the highlight of the show was the acting and writing.  All the actors, from the main cast to the more ancillary characters, played their characters well.  Jensen Ackles particularly did a great job as Ben/Alec when he was brought on a series regular in season 2.  Ultimately I think it was a show that Fox killed off too soon.  I think even with the weird tangents that the show went on in season 2, there was still room to tell compelling stories.  All in all, it was a very good series with a lot of action, drama and even some comedy. It is definitely not a show that will appeal to everyone's taste, but if you like action series give it a try.",1359158400,,1825,4.42814371257485
3373383,5,B00152R4VK,"Only problem with this series is it didn't last long enough. It was almost as if the producers weren't sure what direction to take the series in, so they just gave up.  Shame, it is.",1357776000,,182,4.2

3373409,5,B00152R4VK,"I just want to give people a heads up.  This version is NOT widescreen.
If you have a widescreen TV, you should head over to Amazon.uk and order
the PAL (European) version.  It's encoded in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen
format.  The only downside is, you will need to play it back on a PAL-compatible DVD player or
hook your computer up to your TV, as all computers can play back PAL or NTSC.
It's a shame FOX gave us NTSC (American) viewers this cropped 4:3 version.
The version from Amazon.uk cost the same as this even with shipping, and took two
weeks to get here.
Hope this helps someone.
I'm still giving this 5 stars, because it's a wonderful show in any format.
Alba's best work by far, and she's in every frame, so it's a must buy for her fans.
Season One is good dark sci-fi action.  Season two is more uneven, but still has a

3373416,5,B00152R4VK,"Let's be real. While Fox has had alot of great series like The Simpsons, Family Guy, and MadTv, they've been notorious for killing shows long before their time. Dark Angel was one of them. I was a really big fan of the show from jump. I was 13 at the time and not a sci-fi fan in the least, but something about how well the show flowed and the characters drew my attention kept me hooked.

Jessica Alba starred as Max Guevara, a genetically enhanced (as in not a cyborg or any other type of machine) girl who escaped from a secret government owned and run breeding/super-soldier training institution called Manticore. Max (X5-452) was apart of the X-5 series (previous X series were unsuccessful) and along with her ""brothers and sisters"" (other X-5 kids) were exposed to nightmarish experiments and brutal warfare training, but eventually made the decision to run away. The first 5 minutes or so of the pilot episode chronicles their great escape. Max and eleven of her siblings succesfully escape, but are all separated. A few months later, a terrorist activated electromagnetic pulse (simply called The Pulse) hits and turns the US into virtually a third world country. All technology is destroyed and chaos abounds. Because of this, Max is able to slip into the real world unnoticed.

The rest of the show picks up ten years later and Max is living in Seattle working as a bike messenger at Jam Pony. She enjoys being a regular girl and chillin' with her friends. Her best friend is the always sassy, ""tell it like it is"" black lesbian Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller). Cindy has always got her back and some of the funniest lines in the series. Max squats with another close girlfriend named Kendra (Jennifer Blanc) who is quite hetero and always on the prowl. Her other two friends are the stoner with a heart of gold Sketchy (Richard Gunn) and the always optimistic Jamacian mon Herbal Thought (Alimi Ballard). Her very conservative and always grouchy boss Reagan Ronald aka Normal (he is the most normal out of the group hence the nickname) is always on her back with some snarky lines.

While Max's daytime life may seem normal, her nighttime activities are anything but. She's a cat burglar in order to pay off the very expensive funds that will help her track down her missing brothers and sisters. One night, after breaking into the apartment of Logan Cale (Michael Waverley), she's caught by the man of the house himself and the two soon strike up a business relationship. Apparently, Logan did his research and found out about Max's Manticore past. The barcode on the back of her neck was a dead giveaway (did I mention the barcode?). In exchange for helping Max find her siblings, she has to help Logan solve his mysteries. See, Logan is really the cyber journalist ""Eyes Only"" who hacks into cable feeds to spread ""the truths"" of the corrupt political society of not only Seattle, but America in under 60 seconds. Max agrees and the first season officially begins.

Oh yeah, Logan also has to protect Max from Lydecker (John Savage), her former Manticore trainer. He's been searching for ""the kids"" as he calls them for all the ten years they've been gone and he'll stop at nothing to get them back. To give a quick runthrough of the first season, a love affair ensues between Logan and Max (you so knew that was gonna happen), Max is able to find some of her siblings, and she manages to confront Lydecker (he's one cold dude) and try to take down Manticore in one of the best finales in tv show history. Well, to me anyway. Pretty awesome stuff. Now onto season 2.

Season 2 is alot different from the first. Without giving the season one finale away, Max ends up back at Manticore, but doesn't stay put for long. She escapes after taking the prison (that's basically what it was) down and releases all of the imprisoned transgenics. About that, not all of the ""gennies"" are quite human. Max has a bit of cat DNA herself (the episodes where she goes into heat are hilarious), but she still has a human appearance. The older ones, not so much. See, they were given too much animal DNA in their genetic cocktails so they possess more cross breed appearances. Like Joshua (Kevin Durand), Max's friend and adoptive brother. He was the first transgenic Manticore ever created and has a human body with a dog face. Still a sweetheart though.

 Anyway, all the gennies are freed and manage to escape into society. The ""regular"" folks freak out and new villian Ames White (Martin Cummins) is called upon by the government to cover up the Manticore crimes by exterminating them. Needless to say, Max is on the top of his list. She feels it's her job to protect her transgenic siblings while laying low as best she can herself. Her relationship with Logan becomes complicated too. While back at Manticore, the bad guys figured out Max was in cahoots with Eyes Only (they still don't know he's Logan) and infect her with a virus that will kill him on skin to skin contact. The two try their best to keep their romance going, but Logan's new assistant Asha (Ashley Scott) tends to get in the way as well.

Another new character is fellow X-5er Alec (Jensen Ackles). Max meets him back at Manticore and the two form a love/hate sibling-like relationship. Alec (as in smart aleck) is a nice guy overall, but always looking out for himself and constantly on the look out for some get rich scheme. Sweet, but not too smart since he manages to get himself in trouble alot. Original Cindy, Sketchy, and Normal also return, but there's no mention of Kendra or Herbal Thought. Where'd the hell they go? Beats me. Anyway, the second season does border on a ""transgenic of the week"" feel, but it has a powerful ""people fear and hate what they don't understand"" message that's relatable to all people. The second season finale is awesome too, although there are a couple of storylines that don't get completely wrapped up.

To wrap it all up, The best thing about Max is that she walks a fine line between a hard ass and being vulnerable. She's not at all a girly girl, but she's also not afraid to let her feelings be known. If she's sad, she'll let it out without being dramatic and with all she's been through, can you really blame her? She's also witty and a smartass. While the show did end too soon, it had a great run with no boring episodes ever. Pick it up!

What made season 1 so interesting was it's focus on Alba's character negotiating between two very different identities and trying to live a ""normal"" life despite being anything but.

Season 2 has aspects of this, but focuses far too heavily on gimmicks like extraterrestrials and bio-mutations. It was far more convincing and powerful when it stayed focused on trying to keep things closer to reality.
