But DMSN is nothing like that at all; it's almost the dream Hollywood 'beauty and the geek' movie - except that it was made in Bollywood.

I didn't realise, until I saw this movie, what a great actor Aamir Khan is - yeh sure he makes great movies - but in Deewana... he really lets his acting shine. Not only that, it's to his credit he got to the 'Darr' theme before Shah Rukh as well.

Ajay Sharma has buck-teeth, thick-framed glasses, a baseball cap with the peak pointing upwards and those rediculous striped skivvies. He's a wizard photographer, and Anita is as fashionable and hot as they come - she's everywhere, on posters, on TV adverts.

Ajay handles most of the photoshoots of Anita. And he's MADLY IN LOVE with her; he sends out fake wedding invitations, makes vows to marry her, keeps following her, including an hilarious scene on the beach where Ajay does this 'power walking' - he just seems to turn up wherever she is.

Of Course, Anita's family get fed up with all this and set a wedding date for an arranged marriage, to a wealthy industrialist. Still, Ajay won't accept defeat and declares that he and Anita are going to get married on that date instead!

How this plays out is spectacular, with some real hair-raising stuff, the ultimate test of love. I won't spoil it but let's just say that this movie treats the love-lorn lunatic in a more positive light than the 'violent love story'. The only drawback is during the first half of the movie there's a second girl, who seems to like Ajay, which complicates things a bit, and not in a good way.

Recommended viewing, and a good partner with ""Rangeela"".",1369008000,,2019,4.560773480662983
