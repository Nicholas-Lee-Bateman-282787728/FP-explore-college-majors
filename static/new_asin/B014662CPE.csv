8729910,2,B014662CPE,"It's difficult to know what the makers of this documentary were trying to accomplish. It feels more edited than directed, as if they decided to shoot random snippets loosely related to a broad theme of economic change and social injustice and then tried to make it all come together (it does not) in the editing room. The filmmakers are obviously passionate about this project, but that passion does not translate into a cohesive statement.",1465171200,,440,4.95945945945946
8729911,5,B014662CPE,"With a narrow scope on the infrastructure that enables the global economy, this film raises a lot of questions without becoming too grim. For example, Sekula shows people whose jobs have become psychologically numbing without focusing on say-- serious workplace accidents that cause physical injuries. It's very nuanced.",1458000000,,320,5.6875
8729912,4,B014662CPE,"Three and a half FASCINATING Stars. If you like long, slowly-developing documentaries about fascinating, important, worldwide topics of economic and social importance, this is one to watch. This documentary, ""The Forgotten Space"", is ostensibly about the unique huge containers that are used to move massive amounts of material over the oceans, around the world. But halfway through, the viewer is on land in Los Angeles as a female 'rent a cop' is chewing out a homeless person, trucks are stalled in an endless line as they are bringing in or taking out containers from the LA port, drivers are making an unbelievable wage, and trains are taking stacked containers of used paper out of this country for recycling. You realize this movie will surely cover the movement of containers, but also as many important and bewitching social and environmental issues, along the shipping lanes, as the director can cram into the documentary. It goes into residences and factories, looking into lives, on and off ships. The narrator has a low voice, seemingly weighed down by the massive issues covered in the film. Even so, this film is mesmerizing, as it slowly hops around the world, making the viewer finally see things that we may have never seen before or things that are unseen, right under our noses. Produced by Doc. Eye Film, Amsterdam and WILDart Film 2010. Written and directed by Alan Sekula and Noel Burch. Based on Alan Sekula's book, ""Fish Story"". A monumental undertaking and spectacle that wanders far from containers and back again. Very Definitely Recommended. Three and a half WEIGHTY Stars! (Icarus Films. Color and black & white. NR-Not Rated, but a little bathroom language. Time-1:52:01.)",1457136000,2,1703,5.085714285714285
8729913,1,B014662CPE,"I thought this was going to be about the shipping industry, but instead it's just one long rant by someone who doesn't understand economics.  Super boring!",1449360000,,155,4.961538461538462
8729914,5,B014662CPE,"Visualizes the entire producer to consumer world.  Shocking way some people are treated.  Makes one want to join THE STOP SHOPPING CHURCH.  Oh, that's right, I already joined.  Okay, I spend way too much time and money on Amazon:  guilty pleasures and guilty as charged.  This is a long documentary but well worth the time.  Definitely NOT to be forgotten!  You will talk about this one for days.",1447459200,,396,4.720588235294118
