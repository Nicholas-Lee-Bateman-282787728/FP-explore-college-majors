8243010,5,B0011Z1T62,"This book told me far more than I ever wanted to know about welding.  It taught me that I really don't want to learn to weld.  While one likely cant learn to weld from this book alone, it provides sufficient illustrated information so the aspiring welder can grasp those concepts which are necessary to master.

Well done, informative and highly recommended as a basic primer on the subject of welding.  The illustrations are fascinating.  This is a great introduction to a complex and technological process.  Highly recommended reading if you are seriously interested in welding or just curious.  Its a good read if you are interested in technology whether you want to learn to weld or just learn a little.",1399939200,,707,4.841666666666667

8243012,2,B0011Z1T62,"The most common SMAW (stick/Arc) welding rods are 6010 and 7018. This video talks about 6013 most of the time. This is more like a selling  tool for a Premier Power Welder that bolts on to your vehicle like an alternator rather than a training video for welding. They should've used a basic ""buzz box"" or a Miller bobcat and focused more on welding techniques rather than the versatility of one Premier Power Welder. ...
