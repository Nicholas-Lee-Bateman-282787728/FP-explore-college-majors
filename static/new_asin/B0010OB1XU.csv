Multiple short sets of lunges, dips, and various style pushups but transitions are a bit too quick to change your set up at home. However the video quality is so poor it's distracting. It seems like it was made in someone's basement.",1499385600,,292,4.232142857142857
8238095,5,B0010OB1XU,"The  old Firm videos  1 --  6  are no nonsense to the point and make you feel so strong.  I love  the 1990  videos .They hit all your muscles  and the workout is already figured out for you. I also find them to be mentally stimulating
  Not boring.  A FIRM believer always.",1474416000,,273,4.0576923076923075

8238097,3,B0010OB1XU,"I did this a couple of weeks ago.  It has been a long time since I worked out to this video.  My original video was in VHS.  With the death of the VHS player, there went most of my exercise videos.  I remember liking this back in the day.  It is a short fast paced video which keeps the repetitions lower than the average Firm video.  This is a compilation of other 'Firm Videos.'  There are a lot of lunges, push-ups, and hover squats.  I only recommend buying this if you are a Firm Die-Hard otherwise I would skip it.  Nostalgia made me order this video.",1393113600,4,557,4.179245283018868

The Older FIRMS are the best workouts! This workout is a ""parts"" type workout (like Standing Legs, Upper Body,etc...like the other ""FIRM Parts"" videos). This one is taken from the FIRM Cardios (Maximum Cardio-with Carissa, Cardio Burn-with Tamela, and Super Cardio-aka-Calorie Killer 2-with Dale). In each of those Cardio workouts, each of them have a short (but good) toning segment after the first cardio section of the entire workout. So the FIRM decided to make a tape of just each of those toning sections into this one-called ""Bust n Butt"".

All body parts are worked in this one-although mainly the emphasis on chest and glutes. The only small complaint of this is they do a lot of pushups, which I would've liked if they subsituted a few for pec flys instead. But the pushups do work fine. There are actually no tall box leg presses (which I like because the FIRM uses it in so many videos already, this one gives me a break!). But the glutes are surely getting a good workout. If you would like-just do a few pec flys during some of the pushups-or alternate pec flys every other pushup segment. ;)

The workout isn't very long-about 29 min. But you will feel a burn and def feel it the next day. A very hard workout to find. I already own all the complete FIRM Cardios from this workout-so this one is good to add in the week and alternate when doing those Cardio workouts (DO get the full Cardio workouts! They are ALL fun (all three!!). :)

There are some quick changes during the workout when moving onto a new exercise-so just be prepared to have your remote handy to push ""pause"" every now and then. ;) I would rate this as a solid intermediate workout. Beginners always use light weights or no weights at all. For advance-you can heavy up the weights and get a killer short toning workout. ;)",1348704000,10,1929,4.518624641833811
