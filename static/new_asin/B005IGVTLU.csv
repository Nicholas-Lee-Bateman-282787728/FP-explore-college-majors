8474670,4,B005IGVTLU,"Ewww!! Gross, I learned something! Yes, it is a documentary and yes it is outdated. Why didn't you people Wikipedia this before buying? I really feel for the four heroes who risked their lives and sacrificed their precious time watching the documentary. How big do your balls or Fallopian tubes have to be to watch and listen to narration? A lot bigger than mine.. What about the divers down there with the animals? Oh yeah, never mind, they're crazy? Silly divers!  (Awkward silence) Ok, if you like to learn and want to see rare stuff about sharks then this will suit your needs. Idk, something fascinating about a species that's survived millions of years without any radical evolution.. Whatever! Starbucks and ITunes are way cooler, see ya!",1402444800,,745,4.866141732283465
8474671,2,B005IGVTLU,The words didn't match the narrator's lips. Do you know how annoying that is? Pass on this if you're smart.,1379548800,,107,4.4
8474672,1,B005IGVTLU,I just mailed this back. I expected a movie and got a documentry. The artwork on the cover looks a lot like Jaws,1371340800,,112,3.9130434782608696
8474673,1,B005IGVTLU,This movie was nothing like it was described.  It is more like something you would watch in highschool as a documentary and fall asleep.  What a total disappointment.,1357430400,,166,4.892857142857143
8474674,4,B005IGVTLU,"The cover pictured is not the cover on the DVD, which is in a thin case, not a regular DVD case.  The product came quickly and was fine except for the different cover.",1349308800,,167,4.0606060606060606
