This one is set up for the classroom (but I wouldn't like aspects of its presentation there), so it isn't terrific for home viewing.  The segments are broken into parts, there is no play all, each section has an unnecessarily long introduction to the material, which I wouldn't like for the classroom (boring to repeat and kids would reject, I believe,) but for home viewing is especially annoying.  Unfortunately, the straight presentation of Teddy Roosevelt an American Lion in its boxed set is no longer being produced and is, used, incredibly expensive.  So it you want the material (which is great) and can wade through the annoying part of the way this is put together, this may work for you.",1470960000,,817,4.891304347826087
