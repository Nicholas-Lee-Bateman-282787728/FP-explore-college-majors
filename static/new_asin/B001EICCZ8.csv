8298265,1,B001EICCZ8,"i had high hopes after ordering this dvd since the description said acceptable or something to that effect.  However, when I played the dvd the sound was sporadic, at times behind the words being spoken by the actors and the flow of the movie was jerky.  The description should have said, sound and film problems.  What a waste of money!!!",1389052800,7,339,4.616666666666666
