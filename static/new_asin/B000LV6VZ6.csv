2714623,5,B000LV6VZ6,I can hardly wait to see season 4! I looked it up on the web and they are in the 11th season on TV in the US right now. I enjoy this show because they take a realistic approach to everyday life. the Camdens are not a perfect family but  they communicate and try to work out their problems.

2714720,4,B000LV6VZ6,"Really enjoying this show. I had just started Season 3, when Amazon put a pop-up that it would be unavailable after February 13th! I hate when that happens, and am glad that I was able to finish the Season before that, and that Season 4 is still available.
The reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5, is because the Message can be somewhat disappointing. The show is clean, it has good storylines, and likeable characters. The problem is that this man is a Minister, and yet, his family doesn't seem to truly believe in God, nor does he ever really mention Him. That's one thing. The other thing, and it is pretty annoying - and getting kind of old, is that there is SO much kissing. EVERYBODY on this show is involved in make-out sessions. I don't mind a kiss, or two, but these people (mom and dad AND all of the teens) do some pretty heavy-duty kissing. All the time.
Other than that, I enjoy the show.",1456099200,,906,4.3352941176470585

2714785,5,B000LV6VZ6,"I congratulate the coach--He is absolutely correct in canceling practice.  We have become so addicted to sports in the academic world that it often takes priority over academics and student health: both should come first, especially student health.  Our focus on  sports, especially violent physical contact sports, has resulted in fatigue, exhaustion, sleep depravation, drop in grades, physical injuries, and tragically  death. Ironically in these episodes, the parents were furious with the coach.  We would expect the kids to be, but the parents?  At least Mary's parents had the courage to support the coach.  We have forgotten our classical heritage: balance and moderation are essential; both Aristotle and Plato lauded the importance of athletics, but they also understood the need for caution.  In The Politics, Aristotle noted, ""it is wrong to work hard with the mind and the body at the same time, for it is the nature of the two different sorts of exertion to produce opposite effects, bodily toil impeding the development of the mind and mental toil that of the body."" And Plato via Socrates observed in Book VII of the Republic, ""For great fatigue and much sleep are the foes of study.""

Each season has a whole new set of typical family issues that gets resolved through love and teamwork on the part of this huge family.  Each role played has their own personality and it's fun to see the kids grow up and evolve.  The father being a minister at a church but admits he's not perfect, nor thinks his children should be either is well.....refreshing to say the least.  This is one of those family shows that served as a great role model for the American family.  Season 4 is the best Season ever but I am saying that with each new Season I'm watching.

Every episode has a beautiful moral message that leaves the viewer contemplating events in their own life and striving to make the best out of bad situations. That's what this show does for me. It encourages me to be a better person and leaves me feeling I'm not alone in wanting to do what's right when those around me just seem to thrive on self-indulgence and ignorance! 7th Heaven sheds a little light on viewers lives and I am so thankful for that. That's enough of my preaching (pun intended). If you've ever enjoyed an episode of 7th Heaven you'll have to get this season, as well. It is well-worth your time :-)

This season Lucy matures into a confident young woman, while Mary takes a turn the opposite direction.  Simon explores what life is like with a girlfriend, and Matt deals with Shana moving to New York.  This is definitely one of the best seasons of 7th Heaven.

2714865,1,B000LV6VZ6,"This show actually makes the Brady Bunch seem realistic.
The father somehow supports a bundle of children on the wages of a minister,while everyone else seem to do basically nothing to bring monetary stability to the household.
At least Mike Brady was an architect.
My wife quite rightly gets extremely annoyed if she ever sees clips or even five minutes of this show,as she works in an area where she helps people with real life problems.
To see the Camdens invite a friend over who has bulimia/anorexia and any other life threatening problem and defeat it with their love over a single weekend is an insult to anyone who has ever suffered such destructive diseases.
Should i go on,i don't think so as i find it stressful even thinking about this show,but to not say a few more words is irresponsible on my part.
What is most annoying of all is the fact that it is such a high rating show with a huge audience.
Please wake up America and any other country that is in love with this drivel.
It is fine with me if you do enjoy it,
however please remember that reality does not exist within this show,it is television,and in this case farther from reality than i would like to think that it should be,
it is irresponsible and much worse at times.",1185235200,5,1244,4.484581497797357

2714875,5,B000LV6VZ6,"Season four (1999-2000) of the very popular family drama 7TH HEAVEN may be the finest of the first four (of eleven!) seasons in terms of sharp writing and superb acting by everyone.  Here are some of the highlights:

EPISODES 1-4:  Starting a new school year and making friends.  Matt wants to move  out, Eric has a heart attack, Aunt Julie is pregnant.  Dramatic episode about the treatment of Afghanistan women.  Lucy gets her driver's license.

EPISODE 5--A doozey.  Teen pregnancy with a stand-up and cheer finale, marijuana possession, and cheating on a key high school exam.

EPISODE 6--A very pregnant Aunt Julie wants a divorce from doctor husband Hank, but changes her mind when both of them gaze on their new-born baby.

EPISODES 7 and 8--The basketball coach locks the gym from low-grade Mary and her teammates, who retaliate with vandalism and get arrested.  Simon is caught giving someone ""the finger"" as a joke in front of Mom and the school principal.

EPISODES 9-12--A woman interned during WW2 wants to make a large contribution to the church and debates seeing a fellow internee.  Simon's group sniffs paint thinner fumes.  Annie's father may have Alzheimer's, while Matt mopes over Shawna being at NYU across the country.  Annie goes to a beach cottage for a weekend's solace.

EPISODES 13-16--Two cute girls have dinner with Matt and his roommate John.  Eric spies on Mary, who is on a double movie date with Lucy.  Names can hurt.  A child is harrassed for having Tourette's.  Romantic Valentine's Day show.  Eric tries to track down an abused boy who wants a prayer request.

EPISODES 17-18--Eric is on jury duty with a bunch of racists; Ruthie realizes that actions have consequences; Matt drives his roommate nuts in not being able to decide whether to see Shawna in Manhattan.

EPISODES 19-22--Eric counsels a troubled young girl, while Hank keeps a secret from wife Julie; all five Camden kids (excluding the twins) are caught in adolescent love triangles.

Starring are a never-better Stephen Collins as minister father Eric, Catherine Hicks as his wife Annie, Jessica Biel as Mary, Barry Watson as Matt, David Gallagher as Simon, Beverley Mitchell as Lucy, and Mackenzie Rosman as Ruthie.  Guest starring are Maureen Flannigan as Shawna, Deborah Raffin as Julie, and Ed Begley Jr. as Hank.  How did I survive these memorable and sometimes harrowing adolescent years intact?
Great parents.

As a footnote, let me add that this boxed set claims to have edited episodes and changed music.  I was timing the episodes like a hawk and watching for cuts.  All 22 of them seem fully intact, and the opening and closing music is all there, so Paramount Home Video must have done a very good editing job.  Or just put on the disclaimer for legal reasons.  There are a lot of social activist issues here; maybe some (800) phone number epilogues have been trimmed because they are no longer valid.  In any event, this season four set of 7TH HEAVEN is a treasure to cherish over and over as we wait for season five on DVD.",1176940800,13,3037,4.846303501945525

2714877,3,B000LV6VZ6,"I just bought this 7th Heaven Season 4 set this past week, and I've only seen a couple of episodes on it, so I'll hold off on actually reviewing the set until I have seen more of it.

That is also why I've only given this set 3 stars. I will decide how many stars this set really deserves after I've seen more of the episodes.

  But I just had a question and I was wondering if someone reading, knows the answer. Soon after I got this set, I just happened to be looking at the back of the box, near the bottom, there was a small addition that stated ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network version"", and ""Music has been changed for this home entertainment version"".

Now I don't care much about changes in music, but what editing of episodes are they referring to? Does anyone know? Obviously it means that they are using the syndicated episodes, with cut scenes. But which episodes and which scenes have been cut in this set.

 Has anyone watched this set's episodes in comparison with the version recorded from the network airing. I have most if not all of Season 4's episodes on VHS tape. Unfortunately, they are all scattered on different VHS tapes in a multitude of different boxes, so finding each episode, will be difficult, and take an inordinate amount of time.

  So does anyone know which scenes from which episodes have been cut from this DVD set?? I really want to know.

  Not that it would have changed my mind about buying it, but maybe I would have bought it from somewhere cheaper than Best Buy, or I would have waited until it went on sale to buy it instead of buying it for full price.

  I am really disappointed to discover after buying it that Season 4 is using cut episodes for this set.

  But I'd at least like to know what scenes I am missing and in what episodes, so I can watch those specific episodes on my VHS tapes (until I convert them to DVD) instead.",1175299200,3,1903,4.355113636363637

2714879,5,B000LV6VZ6,"Finally, the 4th Season of 7th Heaven is coming to dvd!!  It's about time.
