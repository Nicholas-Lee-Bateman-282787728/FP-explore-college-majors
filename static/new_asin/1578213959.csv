196452,5,1578213959,"This is an excellent historical and biblical summary of Christ's birth, His blood lineage and legal lineage from King David as God promised.  It explains the Magi (wise men) and who they really were.  It links the real time line of the birth of Christ and our traditional Christmas combined with pagan holidays. Dr Missler brings out the childhood and growning up of Jesus, especially in Psalm 69, the ridicule, misery and hardships He endured as an illegimate child as seen at that time by many.  I must see it again, there is too much to absorb the first time around.  A great Bible lesson about Jesus Christ,our Saviour.",1290816000,4,623,4.6880733944954125
