7900848,2,7885167887,"I was really looking forward to receiving this DVD based on the previous positive reviews.  However, it was never mentioned that the DVDs are in black and white!  My four year old son has no interest in the DVDs, since the images are not in color.  It is a shame, because the quality is decent.  In the future, the seller should mention that the DVDs only come in black and white, so I wouldn't have wasted good money.",1407456000,6,418,4.32051282051282

I bought it so my son could learn Chinese while watching it. It worked. Barbapapa is an old French cartoon, teaching old and strong values, siuch as being kind, nice, showing compassion but also be strong and ready to fight for their values.",1387324800,2,272,4.571428571428571
