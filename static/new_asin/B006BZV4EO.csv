8496221,5,B006BZV4EO,"I very much enjoyed this well-produced documentary about a very interesting British woman who used her wealth and position to the benefit of many of the greatest jazz musicians of her time. There are a dozen or so interviews with important jazz musicians, and many of the ""out-takes"" from these interviews are included as ""extras."" Picture and sound quality is also generally very good. Strongly recommended.

This DVD is not encoded for North America, so I had to play it on my computer using the free VLC utility. If you live in North America, don't buy this DVD if you don't have a DVD player that plays international DVDs (most do not) and you're not willing to find and install VLC to play it on your computer. VLC is easy to install and use, and I don't know of any reason not to use it. I've also put it on my wife's computer so she can play DVDs produced by textile artists in Australia and Japan.",1472774400,,905,4.451807228915663

I don't know what to do I'm trying to find out how to return these DVDs. Perhaps you can a sista Amazon",1436572800,,266,4.037735849056604
