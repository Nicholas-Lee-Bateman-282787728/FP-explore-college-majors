2470204,5,B000CQM4LA,These are great Easter movies. The original Peter Cottontail reminds me of being a kid. I always loved clay animation. The new Peter Cottontail is such a cute movie with great music and excellent computer animation. My daughter and I watch these over and over again. I definitely recommend buying these movies!,1300320000,,310,4.980769230769231
2470205,4,B000CQM4LA,"It doesn't really tell the story that I remember about Peter Cottontail, but it's a cute little modern story about Easter bunnies with a few other characters.  There are a few catchy tunes and my kids are entertained each Easter when they watch this.  It's non-religious, so if you're looking for a true Easter story to share, this isn't it, but it's still a family safe video for the kids to watch.",1296864000,,399,4.527777777777778
