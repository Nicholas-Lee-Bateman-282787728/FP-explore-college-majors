8339587,5,B001SAOTWQ,"Super thanks, I have a lot to practice. Shipping was quick.",1473120000,,59,4.454545454545454
8339588,1,B001SAOTWQ,"There is no instruction here.  No details, no posture, shape, description of movements, outside of their names.

This is a demonstration video.  Not good.

Helen is very talented as a practitioner.  There is just no instruction.",1464912000,,228,5.222222222222222
8339589,3,B001SAOTWQ,"She is really impressive in her performance. The form itself is a bit on the flowery side, and the move demonstrations are pretty useless, there are far better uses for some of the moves in the form than what they show here, also the application demonstrations are pretty silly and far too stylized. If you are looking for a soft internal style just to learn for health reasons or performance more likely, it is good as any other. If you are looking to learn internal styles as a serious martial artist, I suppose it is worth looking at, but I would recommend not to waste your time and instead go find a reputable teacher of Chen taiji, or bagua/xingyi. Likely not someone who is all into doing performance stuff, the wushu stuff gets to be too flowery and too far removed from the 'martial' aspect of martial arts.",1428364800,,816,4.52027027027027
8339590,4,B001SAOTWQ,"I have been training in a number of martial arts for over 20 years and have been an instructor in many of them for 15 years.  Helen Liang's  demonstrations in this DVD are outstanding as are all of her videos,  5 star for  performance, certainly inspiration for all of us practicing these techniques.  The instructional part of the DVD where each of the movements are demonstrated are done at normal speed which makes it very difficult to follow the individual movements in detail.  This is made worse by some of the movements where her back is to the viewer and the full movement can't be seen.  For instruction I would rate this a 3 star.  Some thought needs to be given for presentation for future videos to avoid these problems.  Using these videos as a supplement to classes would certainly be beneficial and rate a 4 star as a learning aid.",1423872000,,846,4.549668874172186
8339591,2,B001SAOTWQ,If you have limited martial arts background (under a few years) or no martial arts background then do not purchase this. Everything is in full speed and some sections are performed with Helen Liang's back to the camera which can make it hard to tell what is happened at all times. I didn't find this helpful at all and it was a waste of money for me.,1391731200,5,350,4.2388059701492535
8339592,5,B001SAOTWQ,"This boxing style is a true work of art. I would buy this DVD in a second just to add it to my martial art dvd library. Buy it while it's hot. This a nice dvd to learn after you've studied Chen Tai Chi Chuan. Almost all the movements are similar.
A beginner can't learn to appreciate the beauty of the movements in this boxing style. You should study this boxing technique while you're young with plenty of time to understand the movements for the rest of your life. It takes a lifetime to understand and master this boxing style.
This is a rare boxing style on dvd, because it was a secret boxing technique by several martial arts masters during dangerous times in China.
After you learned the movements, then you learn how to master every movement in this form. Maybe, if you're lucky, you might learn how to use the applications to the movements you just learned. It helps to learn Tai Chi first with push hands and applications before you try to learn this boxing style. You can buy Tai Chi dvds and books from YMAA here on Amazon.
The fundamentals of this boxing art is similar to caligraphy. How can you write caligraphy if you don't know how to read and write?",1367884800,3,1167,4.407407407407407
8339593,5,B001SAOTWQ,Real Joy to Watch. At first opening of sequence seemed like Chen but after but a millisecond this view changes. Very intrigging Elegant Helen Liang painting as she goes a true master and Artist. Everything you may have heard of about this style whether in myth or elsewhere it's all true and more.,1315180800,4,297,4.622641509433962
