8010087,5,B0001CNQ08,"This is an obviously low-budget documentary that was filmed mostly at some expo that covers a wide variety of esoteric topics, including alien and government cover-ups, alternative healing, psychic abilities, suppressed knowledge, and so forth. My only complaint is that it doesn't follow a linear format like most documentaries and just sort of jumps around from one topic to another with nothing connecting the two, but in a way, that's sort of what makes it unique. In fact, I'm not sure I would call this a documentary. There's no voice-over used, no introduction, middle, and end with concluding statement or summary, and seemingly no clear agenda by the filmmakers involved. If anything, it's just a compilation of interviews on various topics that you don't hear about in the mainstream. Somehow this seems to work though, because the interviews with the various individuals are interesting enough by themselves. And since previous reviewers haven't really revealed much about what those topics are, I'll go ahead and highlight a few for you: You have Sonne Ward, who talks about his Tesla-inspired ""implosion machine"" (which supposedly makes solid material simply disappear!), Michael Tsarion, who shares his beliefs about Atlantis, Aliens, and the origins of man (among other things), Jim Marrs who goes into his research on secret societies, and Jordan Maxwell, who discusses his views on how American government has been hijacked by the British and really acts as nothing more than a corporation in conjunction with private banks. As for alternative healing, there is an interview with a women who uses a ""vocal healing"" technique targeting the chakras of the body (which she demonstrates on camera), as well as a bit on ""ear candling"" with another woman who talks about her experiences using a Rife Machine (a sort of ""frequency device"" used for detoxification) and its eventual confiscation by government authorities. Also, in the bonus footage there is a part on the relaxing and energizing properties of ""dancing"" helix beads that's pretty neat, too. There are also interviews with people of ""psychic"" abilities, such as one man who claims to have predicted 9/11, another with a woman who uses photography and computer technology to detect people's auras, and one with two individuals who discuss ""remote viewing"". Oh, and I almost forgot... for all you cryptozoology and paranormal fans- in the beginning there is some excellent footage of the mysterious so-called flying ""rods"" (or ""skyfish"") that many people have been fascinated with. Well, I think that pretty much covers everything! All in all, a pretty interesting film, though the title is a bit misleading (I half expected to see some kind of Alex Jones-inspired piece, and was pleasantly surprised!). Really, there's something for everyone here (except for the closed or narrow minded, that is), so if it's available for a decent price, then by all means give it a try!",1237766400,,2944,5.186974789915967
8010088,1,B0001CNQ08,"Dont waste your time or money on this doc. The First half of this documentary jumps around from idea to idea while giving almost no information. None of the people presenting the ideas are credible AT ALL. It is as if someone with a home camera went to a new age convention and interviewed random people. Then once the credible people such as Jordan Maxwell are presented the dvd is practically over. Jordan maxwell doesn't say anything he didn't say in his lectures which you can watch for free on Google. And as for the person before me, who says he is making it up as he goes, he isn't. Like he says do your research.",1223683200,3,620,4.353448275862069
8010089,4,B0001CNQ08,"This documentary was pulled from the shelves of BlockBusters all across the nation when it was released.  They said it was because of a ratings problem but I was told by a BB insider that Walmart and BlockBuster wrote a letter refusing to carry this product on the grounds that it was anti american in nature and was a product that had the potenial to damage young minds.  It was unbelievable and I believe a pattern that so big companies are taking against free speech.  Not to mention this is a very interesting doc.

8010090,2,B0001CNQ08,"This is a documentary that deals with quite a few ""peripheral"" ideas,  some that have been around for a while. The opening segment on ""rods"" was fascinating and intriguing and I had not heard of this phenomenon before even though they were ""discovered in the early 90's. Aural or ""Kirlian"" photography has been around since the late 60's. Remote viewing has been the backyard for psychics for some time. All good stuff; all real as far as I know.

Some of the ""other"" stuff may or may not be real- the conspiracy theory fanatics will probably love these segments. I personally thought the DVD went way down hill with these few sections. Not so much because of the subject matter but the ""researchers"" they found to talk lacked credibility and believability. The film maker appears to have gone to some kind of convention and videoed a few of the most far out ideas presented. The people they picked to give their ideas looked a ""little off"". If you watch the video you will understand what I mean.

The longest segment which was also the last segment seemed so convoluted as to be given by a mentally ill person. I'm not kidding. This guy started out with an interesting angle but soon I felt he was making it up more and more as would a ""mental"" patient who is delusional. He started rambling and trying to connect many disparate things that just got down right ridiculous. I finished watching the entire DVD but honestly the last segment made the entire DVD feel like a hoax or a well put together practical joke for the gullible. Because several of the earlier segments have actually been well documented for many years the DVD does have some credibility, which is why I gave it a two rather than a one rating, but overall, two thumbs down for me.",1159228800,12,1750,4.56687898089172
8010091,4,B0001CNQ08,"I'm a novice to this conspiracy theory stuff and am absolutely fascinated by all the hidden knowledge that is out there, perhaps even a little obsessed.

Okay, the sound healing and aura photography sound like B.S. to me. Everything else, including the American/British connection and especially the Atlantis theory are amazing. The idea that we are some alien half-breed really is mind-blowing. Hey, you never know...

Good luck finding a copy of this DVD! I think I found the last copy available on the internet, or anywhere for that matter. I personally believe ""they"" made sure it went out of print on purpose. But if by lucky chance you happen to come accross one, buy it.

One thing is for sure, and it's a little bit terrifying, but my view of reality has definitely changed. Maybe that's a good thing.",1156636800,6,809,4.764285714285714
8010092,4,B0001CNQ08,"I thought the first half was focused a bit too much on the metaphysical aspect of things. But the second half was really interesting. Its a good documentary for anybody who is interested in the truth. Whether it be, Secret Societies, Elite Organizations, NWO, or a higher power. I will definately watch this again, and again.",1142467200,4,325,4.821428571428571
8010093,4,B0001CNQ08,"Great film that really shows what this new digital age can do. Only five or seven years ago the ""established"" media did everything possible for you not to make a film like this. But thanks to the internet and good technology at an affordable price, a documentary like this can be made.

Better than average production values and excellent investigating.

The only negatives is that some of the theories is a bit far fetched. Note: SOME OF THE THEORIES, not all. Maybe 15-20% are far fetched which will be enough for the mainstream media to use to bash this production should it get too popular. But otherwise it is an excellent film, the main focus of the film are true.)

If you live in the US, this is definitely worth buying, since I guess this will be unknownnews to most.",1106179200,12,776,4.5285714285714285
