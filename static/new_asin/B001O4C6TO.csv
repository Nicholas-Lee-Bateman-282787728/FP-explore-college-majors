8329531,5,B001O4C6TO,"Most of the old-time B-westerns claiming to be film adaptations of Zane Grey novels don't even remotely resemble the novel. This one is probably the most faithful to the original story line that I've seen. Its definitely worth watching, especially if you're a Randolph Scott fan.",1506988800,,279,5.086956521739131

8329533,2,B001O4C6TO,"I would have rated this a star or two higher for content, but the video is AWFUL!!!  Video quality itself varies from fair to rough.  The audio quality is at time muffled and at times practically inaudible.  Too Bad. Obviously this is an old print, but I think I might have enjoyed the movie itself had the quality been better.  No one seems to monitor this at Amazon prior to making these selections available.  This is not the first time I have run across this problem.",1478044800,,471,4.430232558139535

Later a man arrives in town, he wants to quit but is dissuaded. A letter tells of a new arrival, the boss doesnt want him to arrive. Three men hear a pistol shot and ride to rescue this man. Snap talks to Miriam. The shooter is paid with coins. The ranch owner is asked for payment for the oasis water by Holderness; they lease the land. Holderness plans to destroy the wells to force Naab out of business. Snap is reprimanded for drinking and makes a promise. Naab sends Jack away. Jack asks for dynamite, he studied geology in college. They must drive the herd across the desert to the next source of water.

Nosey uses a divining rod to find water. Jack spots a cleft in the rocks. Water flows! Jack is welcome to stay. He is given a saddle and a horse. Holderness arrives and wants to hire Jack. He argues with Naab and tries to draw his pistol. Naab knocks him out then shoots the guns out of Chicks hands! Nosey teaches Jack how to shoot. Snap brings a gift to Miriam. Jack explores the area and finds a hidden shack. Snap offers a job - get rid of the rock picker. Snaps conversation is overheard! Miriam goes to warn Jack about Chick Chances intention.

The Holderness gang sees Miriam and stops her. When Day rides up he is shot! Nosey shows the record book to Naab. The men at the wedding party mount up to chase Holderness! Snap argues with Holderness, then falls silent. The wedding party rides to Holderness hideout. Jack enters the shack and confronts Holderness. There is a struggle! Andy Naab enters the shack and fights with Holderness. Jack loves the desert, it brought him happiness.

This is based on a novel by Zane Grey, a dentist in the East famous for his novels about the West. Donald Woods plays John Abbott, Evelyn Venable plays Miriam Naab, Sidney Toler plays Nosey. It is a story about property conflicts, water is a precious resource in the desert that allows cattle raising. Romantic conflicts add to its complexity. The plot is better than average.",1463443200,,2458,4.566893424036281
8329537,3,B001O4C6TO,"I'm a big Evelyn Venable fan and it's hard to find her films.  I wasn't expecting much, but this western is pretty good.  The big problem is the sound and print quality, which is very poor.  I can't recommend the film because of the poor quality unless you're stuck on Ms. Venable the way I am.  If you want to see her at her best then try, 'Death Takes A Holiday' with Evelyn and Fredric March, 1934.",1430265600,,401,4.1688311688311686
