5733201,5,B00CPTUNKG,"I enjoyed this newly dubbed version of this anime, particularly with it holding its original title. I remember this as ""Spaceketeers"" in the early 80's. The anime is still top notch for its time and the dubbing is not too bad. I'm still waiting for the release of Grendizer, but will be picking up Danguard Ace when its available.",1379980800,,330,4.610169491525424
5733202,4,B00CPTUNKG,"This is a space drama about three cyborgs who unite to help a princess restore balance in the galaxy.

Fans of Ultraman will enjoy this from the similarities. Ultraman Cosmos fans will really enjoy.

The lead cyborg hero has the ability to grow and fight large alien monsters. Like Ultraman Cosmos, there job is not to kill but remove the evil essence that has caused peaceful creatures to mutate into evil monsters. There is one main evil source that is the cause and an evil being that lies there who is spreading the chaos.

This was known as Spaceketeers from the Force Five series.
Picture quality was very good to for a show from 1976.

The transfer was done very well Some of the dubbing can get a little cheesy, other than that, I strongly recommend.

I like how they spliced enough episodes together to create a story and an ending.",1377993600,4,841,4.543046357615894
5733203,3,B00CPTUNKG,"Like when Battle of the planets were re-dubbed as Gatchman  I was very disappointed that my beloved childhood Spaceketeers were changed so much as Starzinger.  it was obvious we have different English voice actors.  The characters names and personalities also been change.  I for one much prefer Porkos with his snorting over John Haka character. Even Jessie and his Astro Bat is now Jan Kugo and his astro bar. The original English dubbed version didn't make fun the sea cyborg's picture hand computer the way Starzinger has.  Princess Aurora is the closet to how I remember the characters.

if your a die hard fan of this classic Japanese series you can find yourself able to over come the flawed changes (in my opinion) in the English dubbing over the original English dubbed.",1377129600,4,779,4.863636363636363
5733208,1,B00CPTUNKG,"This is NOT the real Spaceketeers that's back in 78'-79'. This is a redub, and the voice acting is horrible. There's no real emotions.

If you're looking for the real Spaceketeers, this is NOT it. This is a 2013 re-redub.

I'm not going to get into details, but if you have never seen the original, then this will not affect you, because you have not seen the real Spaceketeers to have a comparison. But if you have seen it, and, like me, want to own a nostalgic copy of our childhood favorite, then keep looking.

Disappointed.",1408233600,11,528,4.479166666666667
5733209,5,B00CPTUNKG,"It's just as great as I remember it.  The only flaws in this movie are some of the dialogue when the characters pause unnecessarily mId sentence.  Otherwise, it was a refreshing stroll down memory lane.  The 3 cyborgs weren't the only ones who had a crush on Princess Aurora. :)",1401753600,,278,4.52
5733210,5,B00CPTUNKG,"Another ace from the past. Cudos to the manga artists and makes of the DVD to ensure that this great series it preserved. If you are fan of old golden age of robotics and the craze in 1980's, then this is a great collection to have it in your DVD collection",1399680000,,257,4.0588235294117645
5733211,4,B00CPTUNKG,The only thing wrong is that it does not play in Danish dvd players and codes but other that it fine,1399248000,,100,3.8095238095238093
5733212,4,B00CPTUNKG,the girls like the move and they were happy to sit  with there older brother and see the show he watch,1394409600,,102,3.857142857142857
5733213,5,B00CPTUNKG,"I remember force five not these episodes so much, but they were great, this is just an abbreviated version of the series.",1392422400,,121,4.545454545454546
5733214,4,B00CPTUNKG,"The die-hard anime fans out there that are either objecting or hesitant about purchasing these feature compilations need to understand that it was the original Japanese studio Toei themselves who had all these TV anime dubbed and compiled into features in the first place. Many of these shows had filler episodes and I believe this feature format is actually the best way to attract these old shows overseas, as you get the real essential elements of each series, while remaining faithful to the essence of the original Japanese series, so they are not sanitized or Americanized in any real way at all. Toei themselves planned out how each series was to be edited for the features. So for all the die-hard anime fans out there, this is really as good as you're going to get. The voice acting in the dubs aren't perfect, but at least, because its Toei themselves putting these out internationally and not a local licensor, you know the scripts never really stray from the original Japanese ones.

As for those who grew up with Starzinger as Spaceketeers on Force Five, I think all the Force Five series have had their rights reverted back to Toei. I don't believe the company that makes them even exists anymore. There's no way they will ever be released officially on DVD. Besides, each of the Force Five series only had 26 episodes produced among them, so they are incomplete with no conclusion, which these features will have. Besides, Toei themselves feel these international feature compilations are superior to the original Force Five dubs.

I would advise all the die-hard purist anime fans out there to read this interview with the person in charge of the company that did all these dubbed feature compilations for Toei. I think he makes an excellent case for the rationale of why Toei went with this approach. It's on the website Sci-Fi Japan and titled ""Classic Anime Gets Star Treatment!""

Besides, the original target age of Starzinger and most of the other series Toei are putting out these international dub feature compilations when they first aired on TV in Japan were children. I think this format will be a better way of attracting a few new younger fans outside the anime die-hards, without them being given it in a way that's sanitized or overly Americanized.",1385683200,5,2278,4.835897435897436
5733215,1,B00CPTUNKG,"For some reason, this set is presented in a fake widescreen format.  Basically the original 4:3 content is cropped on the top and bottom to make it fill a 16:9 frame.  What this means is that we're CLEARLY missing screen information as we watch, and consequently, the resolution is horrible.  The image is blurry and an eyesore.  I'm unsure if this is Shout! Factory's fault or if they're simply outputting the ruinous presentation that the ""movie edit"" producers created.  I'm leaning towards the latter since Shout! is an exemplary home media company.  Bottom line: Don't waste your money.  Even a decent Blu-ray upconversion won't render this watchable.",1382227200,11,656,5.074766355140187
