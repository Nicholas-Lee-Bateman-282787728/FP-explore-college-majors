49255,5,0783225857,"This movie is absolutely incredible.

Everyone knows the story of To Kill A Mockingbird, but this movie allows it to come to life in such an incredible way. Gregory Peck does an incredible adaptation of Atticus Finch, the Southern lawyer who attempts to keep peace while managing his internal conflicts with society.

This movie perfectly sets the story in the small Alabama town that gets wrapped up in a landmark case surrounding the accused Tom Robinson. If you are looking for a memorable, family movie- then this has got it all. Teaches incredible lessons, while perfectly balancing an unforgettable story about loving one's neighbor.",1515456000,,639,5.134615384615385

49305,5,0783225857,"This is a very wonderful movie. After reading the book recently, I just had to watch this film and I'm glad I did. Thankfully, they don't say the N word as often as Harper Lee did in her book. The themes of the book and film are still so relevant in today's society, which are racism, injustice in the judicial system, and police brutality. The love Atticus has for his children is so beautiful and his character is very amazing. Hes also a great lawyer. They couldn't have chosen a better actor for this role. It moves me every time I watch it. All the actors were amazing and the storyline is great. Whether you usually watch films in black and white or not, I urge you to watch this film because it's terrific. I highly recommend it to all.

49358,3,0783225857,"Review of To Kill a Mockingbird
Hot Toasty Rag, August 10, 2017

To Kill a Mockingbird is pretty famous in my household. My mom loved Gregory Pecks portrayal of the integrity-filled, honest, caring, patient father so much that she named my brother Atticus. It was a running quotation when I was growing up to say, Do you know what a compromise is? with a little Southern drawl. I know my family is one of millions who have tried to emulate Gregory Pecks clipped pronunciation of Scout; that one word is another one of our famous and long-running movie quotations.

Unfortunately, theres nothing more American than racism, and in this adaptation of one of the most iconic American novels, lawyer Atticus Finch defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Since its the South, you can only imagine the backlash he and his family receive from the community when he steps up to give Tom Robinson his right to a fair trial. As in the novel, the story is told from the point of view of Scout, Atticuss young daughter. Mary Badham plays Scout, and shes not only adorable, but completely earned her Oscar nomination. She was only ten years old, and the youngest actress to be nominated at that time!

To Kill a Mockingbird marks Gregory Pecks most famous role, and while everyone knows the famous In the name of God powerful courtroom speech, his performance isn't just a Gregory Peck role. Hes a caring, concerned father, and the scenes between Greg and Mary are beautiful. Greg won an Oscar for his performance, and the film also picked up statues for Adapted Screenplay and Art Direction. Elmer Bernsteins lovely theme was nominated, but it was hard to compete against Laurence of Arabia, which took the music, director, and picture awards away from To Kill a Mockingbird. This is a real American classic, so if you're that one person in the country who hasn't yet seen it, rent it so you can join in the conversation with all your family and friends. Even if you're particularly attached to the novel and don't generally like film adaptations, give it a chance. Harper Lee herself loved the movie and thought Gregory Pecks performance was so wonderful, she gave him her fathers (the real Atticus Finch) pocketwatch. Pecks grandson is named Harper, which is really sweet, and it shows just how much this role and film meant to him and his family.",1502323200,,2357,4.7299270072992705
49359,5,0783225857,"Gregory Peck is wonderful. He is a southern lawyer, widowed and raising two children. It shows the way the world looks through the eyes of children, seeing the unjust and evil in people. The children are very funny and entertaining. One of the things with the children is, they are always looking for Boo Radley. A scary neighbor that is a shut in. They have never seen him but they know he lives in a dark old house down the street. He watches them too but they never see him. If you haven't seen this movie, you will be wow'ed at who the actor is that is Boo.

49385,5,0783225857,"This review is for the 2-Disc Universal Legacy Series Special Edition of To Kill A Mockingbird which I purchased newly released in 2005.  It has since been upgraded to Bluray and a ""50th Anniversary"" edition but the contents are essentially the same for all releases since 2005.  The discs are handsomely packaged in a ""book"" style case which opens with a front cover enclosing a lot of photographs and some essential ""liner notes"".  The DVD's themselves are the classic Widescreen presentation of the film (with Dolby or DTS surround sound, your choice) accompanied by a number of short featurettes, including the wonderful Scout Remembers; and the 2nd Bonus Disc which contains two long feature documentaries: A Conversation with Gregory Peck and Fearful Symmetry: The Making of To Kill a Mockingbird, both of which are going to be captivating to any fan of Peck, Harper Lee, or of this film alone.  The beautiful transfer of film and sound on this collection is perfection and if you have a large flat screen TV and a good AV Receiver to run your movies through, you will be astonished by the quality and feel like you are in a movie theatre on Christmas Day in 1962, watching a virgin copy of the reels.

For most of my life, I have always held Casablanca and Citizen Kane as my favorite B&W classics, but as the years drew on, the movie which has held its luster, held its captivation with drama, B&W cinematography, screenwriting, and a cast of actors with a delivery so real you feel like you are part of the living little town, Mockingbird has risen to top of my list, not just in terms of B&W filmography but all films in general.  Harper Lee's novel was treated with utmost respect, the storyline remaining true to her style of ""voice"" (through Scout) and in her picturesque manner of imagery: To Kill A Mockingbird is the perfect film.  You will also, if you love this film, find yourself revisiting the bonus features, something which with most DVD/BR releases, ""special"" or not, don't usually get more than one run-through.  The two Features on the 2nd disc are amazing documentary films in their own right, brought to us by Barbara Kopple no less, and Charles Kiselyak who dives deep into the film and book and Harper Lee's inspirations.

My copy of the DVD set came with a collection of postcard reproductions of promo posters, I hope the new editions still contain those!

If by some crazy chance, you have never watched this movie, much less owned a copy, you certainly owe yourself a little over a couple hours to immerse yourself in a small piece of American cinematic and social history, in a story which is immediately engaging and dramatically riveting.  This is a beautiful, haunting, emotional, and inspiring film of a quality which is rare, to this day, in Hollywood productions.  Every now and then a film reels us back from the mega-entertainment sector of movies which are wonderful flash-bangs keeping us high on fictional unreality, every once in a while we have something which accomplishes the wonderful in a much quieter, but equally mesmerizing manner.  Not to say you will find Mockingbird boring, oh no!  Mockingbird is never boring, the story comes at you like waves on the shore, each one enveloping you more and more, it will move you, anger you (I hope), touch you, inspire you (I hope again).

Get Mockingbird today, you will not be sorry you did.",1495756800,3,3388,4.757679180887372

49433,5,0783225857,"Overall, I liked the movie for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The movie pretty closely followed the book. In my opinion, the characters were very similar personality wise as they were in the book. For example, Scout was just as sassy as she was in the book. Calpurnia was also just as I thought she would be. The town of Maycomb was the same too. It showed the town square and jail. I also found how the court case played out in the movie interesting. The courtroom was set up just as I saw it and the events happened as they did in the book. I found this interesting as I wanted to know how it would play out
There were some things I did not like about the movie. One thing was that some characters were not as they were described. Boo Radley was much cleaner looking in the movie than Scout said in the book. In the book, she said he had ripped jeans, while in the movie he did not. Another thing is that they change some characters roles. An example is, in the book, Miss Rachel is Dill's aunt. However, in the movie, his aunt is Miss Stephanie. Lastly, Scout is really not the main character in the movie. It is still from her point of view, but mainly focus's on Atticus and his case. This subtracts from some of the adventures Scout has in the story",1486944000,,1249,4.208333333333333

49435,5,0783225857,"To Kill a mockingbird was a great book and movie. It matched the book most of the time. There were a few scenes added in and taken out. Some that were added in were about Bob Ewell. They also took some characters away. The movie doesn't really have a background family for the finches. They took Aunt Alexandra. If you watch the movie first though, you will not notice. The majority of the characters look different in the movie then explained in the book. Boo Radley is smaller than I imagined. He also had lighter skin and hair. Scout is bigger than explained. She has shorter hair but her personality is the same. Dill looks the same and so does Jem. Atticus looks exactly as I expected. He is tall with dark hair. He is kind, respectful and responsible. This movie is very Old-fashioned, yet very enjoyable. I would highly recommend this. I give this 5-stars.",1486944000,,863,4.538461538461538
49436,3,0783225857,"I enjoyed the To Kill a Mockingbird movie.  There were some flaws but overall it was a pretty good movie.  I like how they kept some of the exact dialogue from the book.  When Atticus was talking about killing mockingbirds and when they foreshadowed at the pageant are two great example of that.  I also enjoyed how they portrayed Atticus.  He was exactly how I imagined him.  He was a calm and kind man.  The movie did the court case really well, too.  They added more drama in the movie than in the book.  Atticus's speech at the end was spoken very passionately and well.  The movie did have some flaws though.  I hated how they portrayed Dill and Boo.  Dill seemed a lot more likable in the book.  In the movie, he just seems rude.  Boo was portrayed as very weird in the book.  In the movie, he seemed sort of average.  The fight at the end was very anti-climatic.  In the book, it seemed much more violent.  In the movie, there was just a couple of pushes.  I also did not like how they took out the pageant scene.  I would have liked to see how they would have done that in the movie.  Overall, To Kill a Mockingbird was a pretty good movie.",1486944000,,1148,4.222222222222222
49437,5,0783225857,"The things that worked in the movie were the extra scenes. The build up of conflict between Bob and Atticus and how some of the characters looked. I liked the extra scenes because it added more detail. The scene about Judge Taylor giving the case to Atticus provided good background information. I also liked the build up of conflict between Bob and Atticus. The build up gave us a better look at how much Bob hated Atticus. In the movie, some of the characters looked how I thought they would look. Jem, Atticus, and Tom looked how I imagined. Although I liked the movie there were some things that I did not like. The things that did not work were that they took out some important scenes. Also some characters did not look like I thought they would. I did not like that the fight was anti-climactic. The first thing I did not like was that they left important scenes out.there is no scene about Jem cutting up Mrs. Duboses flowers or about Cecil making fun of Atticus. I did not like this because these were important scenes showing how the town thought of Atticus. Some of the characters looked different and I did not like that. Scout, Boo, and Dill looked different. Scout looked younger than I thought, Boo looked more normal than I thought, and Dill looks entirely different. The third thing I did not like was that the fight was anti-climactic. The fight just happened really quickly and you could not see much of it. Overall, the movie was good.",1486944000,,1455,4.5361216730038025
49438,5,0783225857,"The movie To Kill a Mockingbird was a great movie, but it had some faults also. I enjoyed how all of the characters tied together and were basically main characters. We got to see a lot more of Jems perspective in the movie than in the book. I also thought that it was great that there were extra scenes added in. I really got a feel of how Bob Ewell was going to be a major problem. But I didn't really enjoy that they cut out some of the scenes. I would have liked to seen what Scouts school looked like but we didn't get to see that. Also, because of the loss of scenes, we also missed some of the characters that were in the book. We missed Burres Ewell, Little Chuck Little, all of the other characters in the school, including teachers. Also, because there weren't any school house scenes, we didn't get to see any play scenes. Scout never fell asleep and missed her que. The characters also looked very different than what they seemed to be in the book. Mayella Ewell seemed more innocent in the book than she did in the movie. In the movie she seemed rude and somewhat annoying. I pictured Mayella having long hair and looking sort of dirty and innocent. To Kill a Mockingbird was a great movie,and I do recomend it.",1486944000,,1224,4.303030303030303

When I tried to play it, it locked up 32 seconds into the movie. None of the player's controls would function. I unplugged the player, plugged it back in again, then tried skipping chapters. After the 3rd chapter skip, it locked up again. I couldn't remove the disk without first unplugging the player and plugging it back in again.

Oh well, a given disk could always be defective, right? Amazon promptly sent me a replacement. It ALSO locked up at the exact same point, 32 seconds into the film. And I had to unplug the player again to remove the disk. As of January, 2017, something is clearly wrong with the product itself. I guess I'll order a DVD instead.",1483833600,3,840,4.384615384615385

Gregory Peck, a single parent. is an attorney appointed by the state to represent an accused, black man, for a crime he did not commit. This story involves the disgraceful way he and his children are treated, while he faithfully defends the accused. It is impossible to not fall in love with his daughter, and son, who don't miss a beat in their fathers work, in the de-fence of this man. It is a very heart warming story of love, respect, and honor. There are times of suspense, sadness, and joy, in this story, while justice is strived to be served.

49527,5,0783225857,"Read this book a long long time ago. Couldn't remember most of it. It was like reading it for the first time. I wanted to reread this book so that I would really have a good recent understanding of ""To Kill Mockingbird"" because I wanted to read ""Go Set A Watchman"".  Harper Lee wrote both books. Her writing is seems so  simplistic yet you feel like you are part of the story. It is so descriptive without being long-winded. When I was almost done reading the book I got a copy of the movie and watched it.  While it was a very good movie winning a lot of awards, I don't think it measured up to the book. In the 1930s  a young girl sees racial problems of the time and it  is through her voice  we are given an understanding of injustice, bigotry and prejudice.  Characters are well developed and interesting. You  feel like some of the people in the story are people that you might know. There aren't so many characters that they get confusing but they keep the story moving right along.  Many of the characters return in ""Go Set a Watchmen"".  I have started the book and I'm anxious to see  how all the folks have grown and aged and meet the new  people in Maycomb Junction.",1472256000,,1177,4.276018099547511

49530,3,0783225857,"What's the right way to criticize a classic such as this? Well, to dull the critique lets get done with the obvious - Peck is imPeckable as Atticus Finch, who is perhaps the nicest nice guy in American fiction. Where the movie disappoints (in comparison with the book) is in generous omissions, some areas of over-emphasis, and some downright erroneous messaging.

Omissions: The entire Ms. Dubose episode is omitted. That part brought out Finch's sense of fairness and Jem's growing up. The conflicts within Finch's family on his taking up the Robinson case are down away with. Jem, Scout and Dill really do not have that much to do in the movie as they do in the book. Calpurina has nothing to do in the movie (the church portion isn't part of the movie's script) whereas in the book, her influence on the children is substantial.

Over-emphasis: The courtroom scene dominates. The movie rushes to the trial, stays there for a while, and removes much of the subtlety the book had in this portion in favor of drama.

Lost messaging: Per the movie, only the Ewell's are downright racist, the mob that tries to lynch Tom Robinson is incidentally racist, and the rest of the town is ambivalent. The book brought out how lonely Finch was in his stand. Also, beyond racism, Finch's morality and humanism doesn't quite come out. About 3-4 lines in the book that really brought out everything about him are sacrilegiously omitted in the movie - the part where he says the one thing that does not abide by majority opinion is a person's conscience. The scene between him and Scout is there, but those words, those golden words are not.

Worth a one time watch but if you love the book, you will be disappointed. Fair warning.",1471996800,,1718,4.678807947019868

A young Robert Duvall amaze us with his sensitive portrayal of Boo Radley. And, then there is Brook Peters as Tom Robinson; convicted long before the trial began-for being kind when he should have walked on.",1460246400,,513,4.829545454545454
49639,5,0783225857,"Well I finally saw the film all the way through.  This is one of those movies where you really have to see it from the beginning to really understand what is going on.  It seems to have 2 stories going at once, adventuresome kids exploring a haunted house with an urban myth young man inside and a legal courtroom drama focusing on the rape of a white woman by a black man in a southern town.  The whole premise takes place during the depression era and is narrated by the young girl Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch.

It is a powerful and well acted movie from start to finish.  Gregory Peck is indeed sensational as a doting father and public defender.  He does a marvelous job and the story is intriguing throughout.  What really gets me about the film is how the son Jim idolizes guns and adventures at the start of the film then comes to an understanding how respected and powerful his dad is within the community itself without the need of a weapon or fist fighting.  The movie does a great job showing how real life events play out.  You cannot always fight your way through things, Atticuss example of using common sense and compromising without giving up your principles is a powerful and true statement.

I would have a hard time turning my back on someone who would spit in my face.  I would have come back with a comment like It takes a real man to beatup and rape his own daughter to that southern racist bastard.  The nerve of that man to gloat to a family who just lost their father is reprehensible.  The movie stays true to the time period.  I also liked how the town sheriff at the end decides to deal with the whole matter at the end.  He seemed more open minded and not biased toward the DA.  I believe he did think that Atticus proved his point and won that case if not for the racist panel of all white male jurors.

Overall I would definitely rate this film 5 stars and can see why it is on the list of AFI 100 greatest films.  If you are a fan of black and white older movies this one is a must see for sure.",1460073600,,2025,4.229166666666667

Adapted with loving care from Harper Lees Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of 1961, To Kill a Mockingbird is a film for which actor Gregory Peck received a well-deserved Academy Award for his unforgettable performance as Atticus Finch, a southern lawyer and devoted father of two children  Jem (Philip Alford) and Scout (Mary Badham). Atticus agrees to defend a young black man (Brock Peters) against an unjustifiable rape charge. Though the defendant is clearly innocent, Atticus must face the attitudes and prejudices of townspeople who have succumbed to cruel poverty and ignorance.

When the film opens, the small Alabama town of Maycomb where Jem, Scout, and their friend Dill play appears to be an idyllic Eden for children, whose only blight is embodied by boogeyman Boo Radley (Robert Duvall), a mysterious figure whose only basis that he is a monster is town gossip. The children are unaware of the real serpent dwelling within the garden, a serpent in the form of domestic abuse and racial hatred. There's a lot of ugly things in this world, son, Atticus tells Jem, I wish I could keep them all away from you. That's never possible.

From the playful, summery days of childhood, to the realization that there is real evil in the world, to the compassion of the heart to object this evil and defend those who are assailed by it, To Kill a Mockingbird reminds us to not turn a blind eye to injustice. There is a responsibility. The sin of killing a mockingbird is an allegory for the sin of harming innocent people. Hate and prejudice are weapons used by the weak and afraid. But to love, to understand, is to be strong and courageous.",1456963200,2,1842,4.779874213836478

49779,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird (1963) stars Gregory Peck as a white southern lawyer in the 1930's who defends an accused rapist, who's black. This movie starts rather slow, but builds momentum, so stay with it. The underlying message of this movie is that everyone regardless of race should be treated equal. That doesn't happen in the movie, as racism and prejudice impede forward progress, with tragic results. However, there's a neighbor who had been shrouded in mystery who emerges to bring some justice. Overall, this movie (once it gets going) is one that you won't be able to walk away from, as it pulls you in and keeps you watching until the very end. The bonus features are great, too. This movie is classic, and deserves its billing as one of the best ever.",1453161600,,759,4.6716417910447765

49821,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird was a required reading book when I was in 11th grade. I never read it back then for multiple reasons, but hearing other people talk about it over the years got me interested in it. Id always heard references in other movies and shows, even the cartoon Bobbys World, so I was always curious as to what they were talking about. I finally gave it a shot recently and while I wasn't planning on watching it all in one night, it was so good that I got through it in one sitting. This is Law and Order: SVU before there was a Law and Order: SVU, minus anyone like Ice-T.

The movie takes place in the Drepression-era South, where times have been rough for everyone. A local farmer is paying Atticus Finch, a lawyer, with his crops for helping him out since he cant afford to pay him with money. Atticus son, Jem, and his daughter, Scout, are your standard youngsters, although they live in fear of a mysterious young man known as Boo Radley, who lives down the street. While they haven't seen him, there are legends about him, and the house he lives in doesnt exactly give off the most welcoming vibe. Their other neighbors nephew, Dill, comes by for the summer, and the three kids play and try to get a glimpse of Boo, but take off before he shows up. Things get serious for Atticus one day, when hes given the case of defending a black man who was charged with raping and assaulting a young white woman. He accepts it, and instantly gets heat from others in the town. Later, strange gifts begin to show up for Jem and Scout in the tree near their house, but they don't know whos leaving them.

This movie is essentially two parts- the children dealing with Boo Radley and Atticus defending Tom Robinson, the man on trial. Scout and Jems story is a good one, and I loved their scenes together. Spending their summer exploring and daring each other to get close to Boos house, back in a time when kids weren't sheltered and scared to do such things. It was also refreshing to see real kids playing kids, instead of young adults playing the parts, like we see so much of these days. The real star of the movie though, is Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. He absolutely steals every scene hes in, playing a very cool, collected man, even when thrown into the roughest situation imaginable at that point in time. One scene that sticks out is when he lets a boy that Scout beat up at school come over for a meal. Its only a couple of minutes, and he isn't that involved, yet actions speak louder than words here. Id like to go into the trial more here but saying even a little bit will give away too much. Its an intense scene with great acting from everyone involved, including people who only have a couple of lines, like the preacher who lets Atticus children sit with him in the upstairs seats. The facial expressions on this guy, while brief, are perfect and made for a very real character.

I feel like writing a review for such a classic is pointless at this point. I may as well review The Wizard of Oz next. Im glad I got to To Kill a Mockingbird, as its one of the better movies Ive seen this year, and now I want to watch more of Gregory Pecks films. Ill be giving the book a shot in the next year too. In the chance that you're one of the eight people in the world that hasn't seen it yet either, and want to see just how impossible things were for minorities not that long ago, give it a go. Its crazy to see how bad things were then, and here in 2015, they're much better, but at times don't seem like it.",1450137600,,3528,4.278443113772455

My kids and I just watched it together after they finished reading the book. The girls gave it 4.75 stars and I and my son gave 5 stars. Gregory Peck was commanding and graceful in his performance and the rest of the cast captured the essence of the book.

50249,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those films that always makes the list of the best movies ever made.  Gregory Peck won an Academy Award for is portrayal of Atticus Finch.  This was Peck's favorite movie role.  There is now a renewed interest in this movie with the release of the new book by Harper Lee, ""Comes a Watchman.""  A black man is accused of rapping a white girl.  Peck is selected by the town Judge to defend the man.  The story is told from the point of view from Atticus's daughter, Scout.  Atticus finch was modeled after her own father, a lawyer in a small southern in a  small town.  Dill Harris, a childhood friend of Scouts is modeled on Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote.  While preparing for his role as Atticus Finch, Peck was able to meet the Author's father.  Unfortunately, Harper Lee's father passed away before the film came out, her father passed away.  A classic film is a film that people remember and does not get old as we move forward.  The Film deals with racial tensions that sill plague this country today.  Can a black man get a fair trial.  Will the truth of what happened ever be accepted.  One of the Best scenes in the film is where Atticus Finch is sitting outside the jail late one night guarding his client when a small lunch mob shows to take the accused out and hang him.  Peck never raises his voice and tensions build.  He is alone and does not want a fight.  Then Scout, and her brother show up and talk to her Father.  Scout start talking to the Mob and asks one of the men to say hey to his son.  Through her actions she helps ease the tensions and the men go home.  Another great scene is where Finch must shoot a rabid dog.  You can tell he does not want to shoot the dog, but he must to keep people safe.  The film had a difficult time finding a studio to produce the film.  There is no love story, the innocent man is found guilty by an all white jury, and the hero is unable to protect his client.  This film also marks the first major film appearance of Robert Duvall as Boo Radley and William Windom as the Prosecuting attorney in the trial.  This is a great film.  When Harper Lee's new novel becomes a film, the Actor chosen to fill Peck's shoes as Atticus Finch will have a tough time equaling his performance.  A truly great film.",1439683200,,2301,4.286046511627907

50306,4,0783225857,"Well performed by all actors. Movie well built. Respects the original idea of the author who wrote the book which was the base for this movie's story. For 1962 times the theme it is a very progressive proposition. Harper's Lee crafted very carefully her novel, walking on the edge of the knife between not being racist and showing the cruelty of racism. It is a work of art using a sweet innocent 6 year old girl as a narrator of her book (movie), because it's extremely difficult to criticize her. After all it's a kid.
I can observe (and which made me use only 4 stars), are only two things: A. The hero of the story is 100% a good person and the villain is 100% a bad guy. That is not true. Humans in which we can believe have some combination of both. At least 5% of the opposite quality each. B. Black characters in this movie (story), are poorly crafted.

Seeing it again after many years I was stunned and depressed by how much less has changed since 1962 than we hoped. But the faithful, heroic labor of thousands and thousands of heroic Americans of color, and of their white allies, in the quest for genuine democracy in a land of the truly free, has won so much despite the forces of ignorance and brutality arrayed against that ""last and greatest of all human dreams."" Harper Lee's novel, and this magnificent film adaptation of the work, teach empathy as beautifully as anything in the language. May we all stand an hour on Boo Radley's porch and come away released from prejudice and fear and determined to stand on the side of love in all we do.

Luminous performances all round. And the HD delivers the superb image quality that this classic film deserves.",1435536000,,986,4.6022727272727275

It is a keyhole view into the life of a southern town filled with prejudice/bigotry surrounding a stead fast lawyer bent on truth/justice being seen in our courts with facts/proof vs. heresay. The life's shown are captured so well from this time period & really make the viewer feel as if they had lived within that same/similar time period & have the same feelings as shown so well. Amazing that is during the 50's it was allowed to be filmed & shown in theatres knowing how many in the country felt during that time before equal rights movement of the 60s....sadly even today many southerners still feel this same way & haven't outgrown the need to have the Confederate flag of injustice flying still...and even as stripes and stars shown on one of our 50 United States flags---seems a disgrace to me it is still allowed to fly.,1434931200,,915,4.5120481927710845

50552,4,0783225857,"I am a bit ashamed to admit my first exposure to the American classic story To Kill a Mockingbird came last year in the form of a stage play.  It was fabulous, and I quickly saw why the story is so well known.  When the movie was on TV a couple weeks back, I decided I needed to watch it.

The story is told through the memories of Scout, the young daughter of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck).  During the summers of the 1930s, Scouts (Mary Badham) life is filled with playing with her older brother (Phillip Alford) and their visiting neighbor (John Megna).

But there is trouble in town.  A black man (Brock Peters) has been accused of raping a white woman (Collin Wilcox), and Atticus agrees to defend him.  Will he get a fair trial in this small Southern town?

The heart of this film is the courtroom drama and the fallout from it.  When the film is there, it is captivating.  The climax is emotionally harsh for several reasons, and I was surprised at how much I had come to care for the characters.

One thing that makes this work is the final act.  It doesnt go where you expect it to, and the jolt packs much of the wallop of the story.

However, the movie suffers from some pacing issues.  The first hour builds character, but it does so slowly.  In fact, its hard to tell where exactly the plot is in all that is happening.  Yes, you need it to fully appreciate the second half, but dang is it slow.

My other gripe is with Mary Badham.  No, Im not criticizing her acting because I think she does a fine job.  But its established that Scout is six and her older brother is twelve.  Yet she only looks a year or two younger than her brother.  Thats because Mary was actually ten when she was in this movie.  Id argue that it would be hard for a six year old to pull off the part, but it kept throwing me out of the film when they mentioned her age.

As I said, she did a great job in the movie, as did the entire cast did.  The villains were a tad on the caricature side, but they didn't have much time to develop.  Our heroes are great, however, led by Gregory Peck, who won an Oscar for his work here.  Other fun appearances are Robert Duvall in a small role and William Windom, who I know best from Murder, She Wrote, as the prosecutor.

While the children are the characters we see this story through, this is not a movie for children.  It involves rape and a few very tense, scary scenes as well as a couple of deaths.  All but one of these scenes takes place off camera, and nothing remotely graphic is shown.  Honestly, most of it will probably go over kids heads.  But I think you need to be a teenager to really understand and appreciate the story here.  The other thing to keep in mind is some uses of the N word.  While jarring today (as it should be), this is certainly in keeping with the time when the film was set.

Even though it was released in the early 60s, it was filmed in Black and White.  Dont let that scare you away because its important to see and think about the story presented here.

Obviously, the story shows the dangers of racism.  Unfortunately, its still something we need to be reminded about today.  But in a broad sense, it shows the importance of reviewing all the evidence and giving someone the benefit of the doubt instead of rushing to judge them.  Thats something that we seem to have forgotten, as weve seen time and time again in recent years.

And so the story and lessons of To Kill a Mockingbird are ones we need to reflect upon today just as much as we did 50 years ago.  Despite my complaints, I do recommend this film for those who want a refresher on this classic story.",1432684800,,3629,4.239416058394161

50602,5,0783225857,"Few films adapted from acclaimed literature live up to the spirit and poignancy of the original source material. Winning the Oscar for best adapted screenplay, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", based on the novel of the same title, is one of a handful of Hollywood gems that not only unabashedly adheres to the parent story but captures its atmosphere. The cast seems to have stepped right out of Harper Lee's prose and onto the screen being exactly how you would expect them. Gregory Peck (in an Academy Award-winning performance) appears to have been born to play Atticus Finch although the production of such a film would have been unimaginable when Peck came into the world in 1916. Brock Peters as Tom Robinson is equally as fine a choice, and honorable mention should go to James Anderson as the morally corrupt and spiritually void Bob Ewell. The children are equally superb, particularly Mary Badham in an academy-nominated performance as Scout and Philip Alford as Jem. Instead of watching a movie, you feel like you've moved into this town.

The magic of both the book and the movie is that it is not just a story about prejudicial and racist attitudes in the South, although these ideas are certainly at its heart. It is these attitudes and behaviors as seen from a child's perspective. Jem, Scout and their summer-friend Dill Harris (John Megna) see the clashes and the controversies of the adults and do not quite know what to make of them. They are old enough to understand what is going on but still too young to understand why a black man would be wrongfully accused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell (convincingly portrayed by Collin Wilcox). Or why some of the townsfolk frown on Atticus for defending an innocent man who happens to be black. Their friend Dill also has some tall tales of his own, bragging that his father is a railroad magnate.

The other storyline involves a kind of ""secret admirer"" of the children that has been giving gifts to Jem in a knot-hole of a tree a few blocks from the Finch's, near the home of the Radleys. The Radleys are a reclusive family and the subject of many tall tales grown and fertilized by the townspeople, particularly Boo Radley who is characterized like a small-town devil through rumor. The Radleys are the target of community scorn, although not with as blunt an instrument as against African-Americans. We get the picture that this story is about untruths, from little innocent fibs like Dill's to the fabrication of the circumstances surrounding the trial.

In one brilliant scene, a lynch-mob gathers to take Tom Robinson from his cell. The mob seems compelled by some traditional sense of duty rather than flaming passion as the Ewells are not well-loved in the community. Atticus, forewarned of the plans, sits outside the front of the jail house as Robinson's only defense. Before there is an escalation of violence, little Scout Finch arrives on the scene. She notices the people in the mob are acquaintances and she begins having polite conversation with them as if they were at a social function. Her presence and friendliness deflates the resolve of the mob, almost as if they have been found out, not by the police, but by a child. How could they possibly explain to her what they are doing?

A large part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson defended by Atticus Finch in a courtroom drama that is unlike most other Hollywood courtroom dramas. Here, the defending attorney Finch is fighting a losing battle where facts cannot penetrate deep-seeded hate and prejudice. Although the jury members dislike the Ewells, keeping the African-American community ""in their place"" takes a higher precedent. The climax involves how the outcome of the trial collides with the mysterious children's admirer. Notice the names ""Finch"" and ""Robin""-son, both birds, like mockingbirds.

This is a masterpiece of film-making that defies most Hollywood conventions. Both the book and the film continue to appear on ""Best of"" lists, and deservedly so. There are few pieces of literature that have helped foster social change, not through a step-by-step objective plan, but simply through the innocent eyes of children witnessing and trying to make sense of injustice and prejudice. For some reason human beings tend to engage in hate more than love. But maybe when the child within us sees the pain and sorrow of unjustified prejudice, that's when we will change our attitudes. A tissue box and a loved one are also highly recommended when viewing.",1431043200,,4503,4.888743455497382

Still one of my favorite movies and I'm thinking you will feel the same. Enjoy!!,1430438400,,402,4.0375

50651,5,0783225857,"I saw the film of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" in Radio City Music Hall in NYC in January of 1963. It was just prior to going into training for the U.S. Peace Corp. It left such a strong impact on me. I saw the book was available recently, I watched the film once again. It struck me, the differences in integrity and values over 50 plus years. My heart aches for people of honor and trust to gain strength again and stand strong in their integrity and values once again in peace. Though it happens, for that I am grateful, but far less known today. Perhaps, because it doesn't ""sell"" well in the media. It remains in my heart that we will again stand together with those who stand strong. There is honor in the humble acts of integrity and values, which have no color nor line drawn in the ""pavement"", of compassion and care for one another. In order to have it, we must live it in truth and demonstrate it to our families and those with whom we come in contact daily with genuine commitment. O, that it would return. I believe it is possible. What say you?",1430352000,4,1053,4.27

Strong portrayal of a man standing up for his values in the face of hatred and bigotry and demonstrating being true to oneself no matter the odds.  Atticus as a father taught his children by example and showed them how to treat others and how to accept others as they were.  Our Book Club read and discussed the book and then watched the movie together so we had two evenings of great discussion.

50767,5,0783225857,"I would say this is the finest performance by Gregory Peck I've ever seen and I've watched 98% if not 100% of his films.  He was a great actor, indeed.  Harper Lee wrote this definitive and poignant coming of age story and it is also a tale of the racial bigotry that divided our country in the 1930's.  It is every bit as timely today...for it still exists in many parts of our great land.  Choosing Peck to portray Atticus Finch, a southern gentleman and widower, was a stroke of genius.  The entire cast, including Mary Badham, as Scout, Phillip Alford as Jem, Estelle Evans, as Calpurnia, the Finch's cook, housekeeper and caretaker, Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, Rosemary Murphy as Maudie, William Windham as Prosecutor Gilmer, Paul Fix, as Judge Taylor, Alice Ghostley as Aunt Stephanie, Robert Duvall, who never utters a word of dialog as the mentally challenged ""Boo"" Radley and so many others was perfect casting in every instance.  Along with flawless direction of Robert Mulligan and the soothing narration of an uncredited Kim Stanley, as the adult ""Scout,"" they bring us into an Alabama summer of small town America that puts us in mind of Saturday afternoon picnics, trips to the local swimming hole, town fairs and Sunday morning blackberry pies cooling on the back porch while a chicken dinner was roasting in the oven for an after church dinner and of a lifestyle no longer present in today's hectic and hub-bub world.  Tom Robinson, a Negro farm hand, has been charged with the brutal beating and rape of a local white trash, young woman named Mayella Ewell, convincingly played by Collin Wilcox.  Her father, the hard drinking, two-fisted, profane bigot, Bob Ewell, frighteningly well played by James Anderson, expects a quick conviction because of Tom's race!  When Atticus takes on the case of Tom, the town and the audience hold their collective breath wondering how he will ""defend"" this quiet, accommodating, gentle man and bring peace to a town seemingly hell bent on a hanging.",1428710400,,2003,4.867647058823529

51309,5,0783225857,"I was surprised at how well all the elements came together for this film. Obviously the main cohesion is centered on Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his relationship with his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford). I would classify this as one of Gregory peck's best movies. It almost had to be shot in black and whit to have the feel needed in the all but black and white movie.

Scout and Jem know very little about their neighbor `Boo' (Robert Duvall.) They have heard and made up strange stories. They spend time daring each other and their summer friend, to go up to the neighbor house as it holds some mysterious crazed person. Through the movie many odd things happen such as a tree that mysteriously offers a series of objects from marbles to a watch, among other things. What do we really know about our neighbors?  Watch as the mystery unfolds. Moreover, what will they find out in this slice of life in the Depression-era South.

51349,5,0783225857,"There's no movie without the book, and the book, to say the least, is an American classic. Harper Lee's book is handled tastefully and consistently. In other words, the movie is as good as the book.

""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is more than the usually discussed issues of racial bigotry and the human condition under trial. Don't let me take away from those values at all, but Harper Lee has written a book transcending a literary social commentary. She has written a love story.

A love story? huh? Who gets married? Does anyone kiss? Are there passages of deep romance? No, no, no. None of that. Try instead family love.

Atticus is the kind of single dad we need to see more of in this generation. He cares for his children so much that he protects them from the fires of his grown-up life of representing an innocent man. He protects them from the full impact of his neighbor's lies. He shows them how to love them, even though he knows his neighbors hate him and the love of fellow man he represents.

If all Atticus, the father, did, was love the innocent man, he would be doing a good thing, but he demonstrates love and allows dignity (when possible) for the ones persecuting the innocent. He shows he is a big man, and his children mimic this sense of understanding.

Deeply rooted in the memories of his children, the story has a gentle subtext of growing up. You can almost taste the lemonade of the porch and smell the flowers in nearby gardens. This, in the movie, though, comes across as more Norman Rockwell than is accurate.

Gregory Peck, as Atticus, claims he played himself, making the role easier, perhaps, for him. Either way, he seemed perfectly cast.

Scout comes across perhaps more wise and courageous than the average six year-old, but it works in the context of the movie.

Arthur ""Boo"" Radley, played masterfully by Robert Duvall, is often forgotten as Gregory Peck's role overshadows his, but is one of the real heroes.

Tom Robinson, as played by Brock Peters who later had roles in Star Trek films, had the challenge of being a beaten down black man in an era and culture of rampant racism. The challenge was to do so without being a caricature. He pulls this odd.

Lee's power as an author here is that she does let her statements about humanity overtake the story. Rather, she lets the story tell the story, and she just writes down what happened in her imagination.

Her characters are not paste-up Southern children or adults, but complex characters all of us relate to (even me up here near Chicago!). Relationships are embedded in the depth of being neighbors. This creating a milieu of angst in Atticus' children when they see the adults warring in court and out of court in matters of truth.

I fully recommend ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" and think to give it the best reading possible, examine how interwoven the story is with its various cultures and characters. The power of Lee's message will be plenty clear.

51446,5,0783225857,"This is my favorite movie. It is perfect in every way. The story is true to the novel. Gregory Peck embodies Atticus Finch, and the actors who play Scout and Jem are absolutely believable as children growing up in a small town in the South during the 1930s. The narratives of the children's interest in Arthur ""Boo"" Radley alongside the trial of Tom Robinson play out as morality lessons facilitated by the wisdom of Atticus. We come away with the knowledge of how important it is to walk in another person's shoes if we are to understand them, and we have reinforced the common dignity that all human beings share as equals. No less important, we are left with the beauty of a father's love for his children. The cinematography and the score are both exquisite.

51609,5,0783225857,"I am ""white"", was born in 1947 in Jackson, Mississippi, and raised by parents who taught me that all people are equal, are God's children, and automatically deserve respect just for being human -- a rare upbringing for a white kid in that era in the South. Later, in my late teens, and we were living in a small East Texas town where half the population seemed to be KKK or at least of that mind-set, I was the only non-Black member of the NAACP. I feel I need to tell my ""credentials"" before saying that I have always considered To Kill A Mockingbird to be top of the list of my favorite books and films. Obviously, no matter what my experience is in regarding to being a civil rights worker, I am still not Black, and can not directly know all that it means to be Black growing up and living in America. However, the branding of this book and film as ""racist"" is so wrong that it astounds me that anyone would do so. I could write (and have done so in other venues) a lengthy defense of the book and film as being profoundly just the opposite of ""racist"", in so far as it reveals the ignorance and hatred of people who are racist or discriminatory on the basis that others are ""different"", but so many others have also done so, so I will not engage in that here. The Political Correctness Police have their opinions about things, and I seldom find myself in agreement with them anyway. For any one, of any race or cultural group, who has an open mind and a heart that can empathize with others, I can not more strongly or highly recommend To Kill A Mockingbird.

I enjoyed and admired the character she created in Aticus Finch (Gregory Peck) who stood as advocate and lawyer for Mr. Robinson.  It was interesting to see this time through the eyes of the main character and story-teller, Scout Finch.  Children see things how they really are and sometimes have a simple but powerful way of getting the message across to others, especially old calloused hearts like Mr. Cunningham.

51696,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird was shot in 1960-1 in B&W. Its remarkable how one brings who one is and ones life experience to what one reads and watches. Every time I watch a movie such as this I make new discoveries. The opening credits show Scout outlining the title by rubbing a crayon over a woodcut followed by continued doodles on the same sheet of lined paper. As the credits begin the box of treasures she opens is Jems which seems rather odd. A series of those childhood keepsakes are scrolled past as the credits appear. Many are gifts left them by Boo Radley. The carved figures, a broken pocket watch, a whistle, various marbles....

Atticus Finch is a remarkable man who in the first place allows his children to call him by his first name. He treats everyone including his black housekeeper/nanny as equals and in all his dealings never raises his voice. Just why his wife died when Scout was two I don't remember reading. Two scenes stand out for me. Jems wide-eyed wonder when a father who refuses to allow him to have a gun is asked by the Sheriff as the best shot in the county to shoot a rabid dog. It harkens to a past to which we are never privy. And the second involves Scout defusing the lynch mob by asking one of the ring leaders to say hello to his son Walter for her. The innocence of youth.

The miss-carriage of justice which is at the centre of this tome is matched by the judicial discretion shown by Sheriff Tate in the closing scenes. The role of Calpurnia, the childrens governess and housekeeper in shaping their lives and attitudes with their fathers approval cannot be understated. These children are truly colourblind even if their neighbours arent. I only wish the injustice and institutional racism this story serves to spotlight were a historical artifact. The movie is not only one of the ten best of 1962 but of all time.

2015

I just rewatched this movie in light of the fact that I'd just finished reading Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman. There has been a lot of shock expressed about the role of Atticus Finch in the latest book. I would remind anyone who is looking at that book in light of the movie I've just seen that the movie is told from the naive point of view of a 6-year-old girl. Atticus defends his client against a white society that has falsely accused him. If the man we meet decades later belongs to a white supremacist organization he wouldn't be the first person to join such a group the better to keep track of what his neighbours are up to. In Ontario Environmentalist groups divide up the political parties among themselves and each join one for much the same purpose.",1410825600,,2627,4.489539748953975

51725,5,0783225857,"This is a very faithful adaptation of the novel.  The novel is the greatest American novel.  It would be recognized as such if Harper Lee had been a man.  That is not radical feminist speech, it is just looking at the world the way it is.  Harper Lee was good at that.  What she looked at was human nature, coming of age, racism and why people tolerate it, social interaction of all sorts, alienation, and what real courage and character are.  The movie has one major difference from the novel.  It roars along at the speed and with the force of a freight train.  The time constraints of a movie force that.  However, the leisured pace of the novel that is a basic part of the creation of time and place is the only thing that is completely different.  It is really amazing how much of the significant detail the film makers managed to distill into the short running time.  You will never forget these characters.",1409443200,,913,4.4397590361445785

51774,5,0783225857,"Well, I love anything with Gregory Peck in it, but really in this movie there is no one else who could have filled Atticus Finch's shoes, especially when facing down a rabid dog.  I did the no-no of watching it directly after reading the book for the millionth time, over the period of my lifetime, which is getting to be an impressively high number.  For me, anyway.  OK.  What I really wanted to say is that when I read a book I get a mental movie of it, so seeing an ""external"" movie can be either a satisfying experience, if the movie jives with my inner movie, or a disaster if the external movie is a completely bad fit.  The movie To Kill A Mockingbird had about a 90% concordance with my own personal movie, and that is pretty darn good.  Apart from all that, you really have to see this.

Set in a time in the south that is long gone, it chronicles in a well-told story the kind of racial bigotry and the dangerous, stupidity of bigotry in that era.  I just love the gentle fair-minded and fatherly character Gregory Peck portrays, and a young Robert Duvall makes an appearance in a key role before he was anyone famous.  This movie is in black and white which gives it  a dream-like fablistic feel which for me, gives a nostalgia for a lost time, even though it was well before mine.  I think this movie is a masterpiece, has no dated feel to it, and if anything is impressive for it's genuis in American film making and the care, thought and artistry that went into it.",1403740800,2,766,4.397163120567376

51863,4,0783225857,"Let's get this out of the way first: To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film in many ways. It's based off one of the most revered novels of the 20th century, so it clearly has an interesting story and an important message. It's characters are fleshed out, it features unforgettable performances from Gregory Peck and Brock Peters, a most unexpected debut of Robert Duvall, and it's powerfully directed by Robert Mulligan. However, it suffers from the same problem that many movie adaptations do: it comes off as condensed, and therefore, not wholly satisfying. Because of this, Boo Radley's importance is underdeveloped, the court scene (no matter how riveting it is) seems abrupt, and it comes off like two well-done but thinly connected stories, one about the kids and their fascination with Boo Radley, and the other about Atticus and the Tom Robinson case. Thematically, they gel, but not as well as they do in the novel. Both are classics, but if one wants a more complete and accomplished work, seek out the novel.",1402358400,,1018,4.85632183908046

51867,5,0783225857,I think this is a movie that shows you how people get into a thought pattern that is hard to break even in its cruelty.  It is also a warning for anyone who gets power to beware lest you become that which you formly hated.  When I see the original movie Walking Tall I have asked if the sheriff who was forced to become mean to win his battle could ever change back to his former self.  I often watch To Kill a Mockingbird and ask myself if the people could change or would tough times just force them to remain the same.

I believe the author herself was very approving of the film. I saw this as a child and really connected to it. It is one of the few movies I could recall in detail from childhood before seeing it again as adult. Watching it again after fifteen plus years was like walking back into an old elementary school or opening an old book- the smells alone provoking memories that put you back in that age; only in the movie it was the music that took me back to childhood. I highly recommend this movie for absolutely anyone; children and adults. The material is serious, but explained by an adult narrator recalling her youth, and explaining things from that sweet moral perspective that only kids seem to have. Both the book and the movie are so great individually that you can safely watch this before reading the book and still get so much from the book. Nothing is spoiled.

Yes, it hooks the viewer, especially the court room scenes.  But my main problem with the movie is what it deletes.  No Miss Dubose taunting Jem so much that it drives him into vandalism.  No cousin Francis teasing Scout. No D. Raymond telling us racism for mixed children.  While watching the movie, we believe that Mr. Ewell is a racist, but the book hammers the point in that the entire town is racist.  I personally would love to see a remake that highlights this as well; however, it would be impossible to find a better Atticus.  And perhaps everyone is right - a remake would inevitable be compared to an excellent movie.  Even if (as I watch it now) it feels a little dated.",1399593600,4,855,4.42948717948718

51898,1,0783225857,"My taste in movies has changed in the 50+ years since To Kill a Mockingbird was released. I loved it then (I loved the book too) and have remembered it fondly ever since. But now it seems stilted and phony, even the stuff with the kids. Everybody declaims; nobody talks the way real people talk; and Gregory Peck is overbearing and pompous, stiff and smug and cold as an icepick.

It's a self-important and pretentious movie, overloaded with phony down-homeness and condescending socio-political moralizing - not entertaining or enlightening at all.

51921,5,0783225857,"Of course, Gregory Peck will not disappoint you in this tale of a small town during the depression of the 1930's or the simple values of the townsfolk, how prejudice can outweigh justice or how help can come from the most unlikely sources. Lawyer Atticus (Peck) and his two children, Jem and Scout live in a poor town and learn the importance of family and kindness to others mean.  The trial is a travesty which caters to the racism of the period and captures the essence of an unjust world where the innocent suffer for the ignorance of others.  BUT, many scenes transcend that, and the final ten minutes will really surprise you.  An excellent production without any sex or language, but some aspects of real life during that period which include references in the courtroom to a rape and an obvious false testimony given under duress which could condemn a man to death or life in prison.

The remastering of this classic in Blu Ray is without a doubt one of the best I have seen.  The disc itself does not contain previews of other movies, the sound is DTS-MA HD with the option of mono and is precise, and the picture is crystal clear and presented in the 1.85 to 1 format that fills the entire screen of my wide screen TV.

It contains a number of extras; more that can be mentioned, including interviews with the cast, scenes of making the movies, and background information on the author of To Kill a Mocking Bird.  The disc is packaged within the standard Blu Ray packaging and is accompanied with a cardboard jacked with the same artwork of the case.

The cinematography was also very beautiful, with a couple complaints... A few of the court room scenes look like they are heavily cropped images, or maybe they were filmed on bad cameras with small film.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: 1962 was a rather remarkable year for films featuring stellar performances by young actors. Patty Duke took home a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her iconic work in `The Miracle Worker,' but Patty Duke's was hardly the only notable performance that year. Duke was joined in the Best Supporting Actress category by another young girl whose performance has entered the annals of the near legendary, namely Mary Badham's beautifully rendered work as Scout in `To Kill A Mockingbird.' There were a slew of other films that featured standout younger performances like `Lolita,' `Sundays and Cybele,' `Cape Fear,' `The Music Man' just to name a few, but no other film that year and arguably any year actually captured the viewpoint of children as magically yet realistically as `To Kill A Mockingbird' did. What's perhaps so incredible about this beautifully heartfelt film is how effortlessly it manages to sum up an entire generation's experience of one distinct region of the United States, namely the American South, dealing with all sorts of issues from the epochal, like race relations, to the seemingly picayune, like sibling rivalry and loyalty). While a major subplot of the film casts a rather unseemly light on the American South, the incredibly noble and moral character of the focal children's father, one Atticus Finch [Gregory Peck], an attorney who is hired to defend a black man accused of raping and beating a white girl, gives this film a strong ethical centre which further helps to distinguish it and which adds inestimably to the film's allure.

Harper Lee was a largely unknown quantity when her first novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was published in July 1960. Lee had been encouraged by her childhood friend and neighbour Truman Capote, upon whom the character of Dill in the book is based, and Truman Capote wrote a brief blurb on the dust jacket of the first edition hardback espousing Harper Lee's talent. Harper Lee had no great hopes for the book, and in fact the publisher had warned her it probably wouldn't do very well, so Harper Lee, and also not to mention the publishers, when the book was sold to the public, became something of an overnight sensation.

Similarly, director Robert Mulligan wasn't exactly a household name, either, though he had had the extreme good fortune to have partnered with producer Alan J. Pakula, who would also become a director of some considerable note, and did have a handful of features, as well as a long television career, under his belt. But Mulligan's quiet, deliberate approach turned out to be absolutely perfect for To Kill a Mockingbird, especially with regard to coaxing absolutely realistic performances out the film's central trio of children, Mary Badham as Scout Finch, the six year old from whose viewpoint and memory of the film is told; Phillip Alford as Jem Finch, Scout's older brother and erstwhile protector; and the colourful neighbour Dill Harris [John Megna], who joins the siblings in a series of adventures, many of which revolve around ferreting out information about the Atticus Finch 's mysterious neighbour, Boo Radley [Robert Duvall]. As the children exploits play out, Attorney Atticus Finch, finds himself caught up in simmering racial tensions when a local black man Tom Robinson [Brock Peters] is falsely accused of having attacked a white girl Mayella Violet Ewell [Collin Wilcox Paxton]. Robert Mulligan resolutely refuses to ever let the film lapse into melodrama, staging things simply and without sensationalism, and that approach gives the film much of its indelible emotional power.

In the trivial but fascinating department,`To Kill A Mockingbird' has one of the oddest concatenations of ""famous relative syndrome"" with regard to its cast and crew of any major motion picture. Just a brief listing includes these gems: Mary Badham [Scout] is the little sister of director John Badham [Saturday Night Fever]; Dill Harris [John Megna] is the half-brother of actress Connie Stevens; director Robert Mulligan was the brother of actor Richard Mulligan [Soap and Empty Nest]; and Estelle Evans [housekeeper in Calpurnia] was the sister of actress Esther Rolle ['Maude' and 'Good Times'].

`To Kill A Mockingbird' is a quiet film, and in fact several studios passed on optioning Harper Lee's novel because they couldn't understand what possible allure it could have for audiences. ""It's about a lawyer and his two kids,"" was all studio executives and never the most prescient bunch, could see in the book, obviously missing the profound truths buried in Scout and Jem's world, like the treasures Boo Radley secrets away in the neighbourhood tree cavity. But like a parent whispering to a beloved child, `To Kill a Mockingbird' speaks directly to the heart, never demanding attention, but commanding it nonetheless. If you've never seen this hugely affecting film, you're in for one of the most touching experiences of your cinematic life. If you're a long-time fan, rejoice that it's been revitalised now to rediscover all over again.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Pictures, and the bane of catalogue title collectors, seems to have finally woken up and realised how to treat its asset treasures. Now this has happened with the release of `To Kill a Mockingbird' and is presented on Blu-ray with an awesome encoded 1080p transfer in 1.85:1. The film is part of Universal's well publicised 100th Anniversary promotional push to revisit many of its storied films, restoring and re-mastering them for home video release and not all of these legendary films will receive Blu-ray releases, unfortunately. This new Blu-ray has been sourced from high resolution scans of original 35mm source elements and the results are simply gorgeous. The clarity and precision of the image is breath taking at times, with beautifully modulated grey scale, deep, rich blacks and piercing, though never blooming, whites. Though the film and all of the supplements and saved for the restoration feature, are in SD, and there are absolutely no compression artefacts to report. The restoration feature, which actually covers a lot of titles, actually spends a few seconds discussing one aspect of Universal's high definition releases which seem to create the biggest controversy: digital noise reduction of grain. In the case of `To Kill a Mockingbird,' there were a number of optical push ins, as opposed to zooms, which magnified grain to a really ugly degree, something shown quite clearly in the restoration feature. Rather than ""erase"" the grain, which the team of restorers quite clearly state is unthinkable, they used a new algorithm which ""averaged"" the grain over the entire sequence, including before and after the optical push. The results should please even the most pernickety videophiles. Several scenes which have been murky in previous home video releases have whole new levels of shadow detail on this new Blu-ray. Well done, Universal and please keep up the excellent work.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  `To Kill A Mockingbird' offers both a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround mix as well as a standard 2.0 DTS mix. This would not seem to be a film especially suited to a surround track, and the good news is the track hasn't been overly ""tatted up"" to provide a false sense of immersion. The best part of the 5.1 track is the fuller representation of Elmer Bernstein's glorious score, one of the finest scores of the composer's long and legendary career for Leonard Bernstein's To Kill A Mockingbird.' Ambient sounds occasionally dot the surrounds and especially with the rustle of leaves in that final horrifying Halloween sequence is a notable example, but the mixers have wisely kept things largely front and centre, as they should be. The audio fidelity is excellent and the soundtrack bears no noticeable signs of age related damage.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula: This is incredibly informative, though Alan Pakula can be a little hard to hear at times. Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula, who were partners for such a long time, have an easy rapport with each other, and Alan Pakula coaxes a lot of anecdotes out of Robert Mulligan. This is totally excellent and highly enjoyable.

Special Feature: Fearful Symmetry [1998] [480i] [91:00] This feature length documentary is by Charles Kiselyak, and is a loving if unshrinking look back on the cultural milieu from which `To Kill a Mockingbird' sprang. There are copious interviews with participants and contributors in the film, which includes Mary Williams (Narrator voice), Horton Foote, Robert Mulligan, A.B. Blass, Norman Barnett, Ida Gaillard, Alan J. Pakula, Gregory Peck, Cleophus Thomas Jr., Phillip Alford, Mary Badham, Elmer Bernstein, Claudia Durst Johnson (author of Threatening Boundaries), Collin Wilcox Paxton, Brock Peters and Robert Duvall. This insightful and interesting documentary also gets into some really interesting, if somewhat tangential, subjects like the importance of oral history in the American South.

Special Feature: A Conversation with Gregory Peck [American Masters] [1999] [480i] [98:00] This is another totally fantastic feature length documentary.  In 1999, Gregory Peck [1916-2003] visits the Barter Theatre, Abingdon, VA, where he had acted in 1940 and where this evening he tells stories and answers questions about his career. Interspersed are clips from Gregory Peck's films and from interviews recorded over the years and vrit contemporary footage of visiting with his daughter Cecilia Peck before and after the birth of her son, receiving the National Medal of Arts, chatting with Lauren Bacall, with Martin Scorsese, dining with Jacques Chirac [President of France], and always with his wife of forty-four years, Veronique Passani, beside him. We also get other contributions from Colleen Sheehy, Don Peck, Carey Paul Peck, Stephen Peck, Anthony Peck, Zack Peck, Thomas Jones, Mary Badham, Daniel Voll, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Throughout, Gregory Peck is informal, candid, and wry. Directed by Barbara Kopple. Produced by  Barbara Kopple, Cecilia Peck, Kristi Jacobson and Linda Saffire. Music by  Art Labriola. Cinematography by  Don Lenzer, Sandi Sissel and Tom Hurwitz.

Special Feature: 1962 35th Academy Award Best Actor Acceptance Speech [1962] [480i] [1:31] This is a model for all the longwinded, self-important award accepters nowadays that was said by Gregory Peck and went as follows: Thank you, fellow Academy members. Thank you, Harper Lee, Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan, Russ Harlan, all of my good friends and associates at the studio. Thank you, members of the press who cover the local scene, critics, and columnists across the country who approved of my work and said so. And I want to thank my family, my good, close friends, who have lent me inspiration and moral support and affection. Thank you very much.

Special Feature: American Film Institute Life Achievement Award [1989] [480i] [10:01] This is a short snippet from Gregory Peck's AFI tribute, including a wonderful speech by the actor. First and last, however, it is the images on the screen that we remember and that we have come to celebrate. Gregory Peck reminds us that a star, ultimately, can be an idealization of ourselves, an image that not only mirrors our aspirations but fulfils them. At the ceremony they honoured Gregory Peck with the 17th Annual Life Achievement Award for allowing us and for so long and to see the very best in our world and ourselves.

Special Feature: Excerpt from Tribute to Gregory Peck [1962] [480i] [10:09] This is another special Academy Award tribute to Gregory Peck, including Gregory Peck's four children.

Special Feature: Scout Remembers [480i] [12:01] This is a really fun piece featuring Mary Badham remembering her experiences with being in the film To Kill A Mocking Bird.

Theatrical Trailer [1962] [480i] [2:52] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer of the the film To Kill A Mocking Bird.

Special Feature: 100 Years of Universal: Restoring the Classics [1080p] [9:13] This is a special promo piece touting Universal's 100th Anniversary and their restoration and preservation efforts. The new slate of restorations is covered briefly, including some looks at the restoration efforts. Universal releases are regularly pilloried for over aggressive DNR [Digital Noise reduction], and there's a very interesting segment on this feature addressing that issue that all DNR-phobes really should watch. Other situations like flicker are also addressed. Audio restoration is also covered in this really interesting piece.

U Control: My Scenes offers Cecilia and Anthony Peck narrating different PiP snippets which offer a number of participants like Robert Mulligan, Horton Foote, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford.

BONUS: Universal 100th Anniversary Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook Blu-ray packaging includes a stunning 44 page booklet that includes  INTRODUCTION BY VERONIQUE PECK. INTRODUCTION BY AUTHOR HARPER LEE. GREGORY PECKS SHOOTING SCRIPT. ORIGINAL STORYBOARDS. ORIGINAL POSTERS & LOBBY CARDS. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD PRESS BOOK EXCERPTS. PERSONAL LETTERS and GREGORY PECKS LEGENDS OF HOLLYWOOD STAMP.

Finally, I'm not ashamed to admit I was once again in a flood of tears as `To Kill A Mockingbird' drew to a close as I watched it to prepare for this review. I've seen the film countless times, but viewing it with this stunning Blu-ray disc, it now has the same overwhelming effect on me, certainly a good indication of just how emotionally powerful the film is. How many films can you think of that lose little if any of their emotional resonance upon repeated viewings? `To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of that rare breed of films which seems timeless even as it precisely recreates a very specific time and place. Classic film lovers have come to dread Universal catalogue releases, rightly or wrongly, but `To Kill a Mockingbird' sets a new standard for the studio, one which they hopefully will continue with as their 100th Anniversary Celebration takes centre stage. `To Kill A Mockingbird' instantly jumps to the front of the pack with this best release in 2013, and it comes 100% high praise. So all in all, I am so proud and honoured to now have this beautifully crafted classic film, they I will not tire of watching again and again. Very Highly Recommended!

This movie transcends time. It's not about time or anything like that. Every actor is relevant. Every scene relevant. The action and the plot flow. But more importantly, it sends a timeless message.

The actor who played ""Bob Ewell"" James K Anderson, was hand-picked by Director Robert Mulligan. It's quoted someplace where he told Mulligan, 'I can play this character. I know him.' pretty chilling. And Robert Duvall is unforgettable as Boo Radley and he never says a word.

I know first hand because I grew up in Jacksonville, FL, in the 50s and 60s. Racism is SO STUPID!! I am white; my family, my ancestors grew up in Jacksonville...most of them were racist.  But for some reason, even as a small child, I could not understand judging against a human being just because their skin was a different color. It made no sense. I knew some pretty detestable white people, and I knew some very kind, loving, smart black people. The movie was a fine portrayal of how people thought in those days---the good, the bad, and the ugly!",1382745600,,688,4.4603174603174605

52106,5,0783225857,"Though readers of the book will miss the many wonderful subplots, the movie is still delights and saddens in all the right ways. This anniversary edition is worth the investment for any movie collection.  I'm not a big blue-ray fan because I don't think they are worth the extra cost for all the hype.  For those who don't agree, we are all entitled to our opinions.  This version works for me.

Gregory Peck embodies Atticus Finch and the bonus features reveal such tidbits as his meeting of Harper Lee during filming of the movie began a lifetime relationship between her and the Peck family.  Haper Lee was a notorious recluse, so this was quite an interesting bit of news.
The 50th Anniversary edition includes 2 discs, one for the movie and one for the Bonus Features.  The worst of the features is ""The Excerpt From The Academy Tribute To Gregory Peck"".  There's nothing new here.  It's appears to occur after Mr. Peck's death and when Harper Lee is introduced, the camera is blocked by people's heads.  Terrible!  Plus, all you want to do the entire time Cecelia Peck is talking is brush her hair out of her face!  So annoying!
The best features are:  ""A Conversation With Gregory Peck"" and ""Scout Remembers"".  These offer fun insights into filming and how cast members were selected.  Plus it's fun to see Scout all grown up!
""The American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award"" is only Gregory Peck's Acceptance Speech, not the entire program.  Although his speech is quite insightful as to the man, given what he chooses to talk about.
""Fearful Symmetry"" is a good look at the overall making of the film and repeats a bit of what occurs in ""A Conversation With Gregory Peck"" and ""Scout Remembers"".
""100 Years of Universal: Restoring the Classics"" is not specific to ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""  It's interesting in its own right regarding the general loss of film and importance of restoration.  For those of us who love older movies, we can appreciate that the importance of restoration was discovered before more of the history of film was lost.",1381276800,2,2058,4.768361581920904

52118,5,0783225857,"I am (ahem...) past fifty, from the South, an English lit and language undergraduate major and an attorney. I can't believe that I waited until this age to read the book and then watch the movie. As is generally the case, the book is much better than the movie, and both mean a lot more if you do a little Internet research on the author of the book, Harper Lee. Imdb is also an excellent resource for information on the movie, particularly on Gregory Peck.

Despite my the-book-is-better-than-the-movie evaluation, the movie is still awesome. This movie was Robert Duvall's cinema debut. Gregory Peck is amazing as Atticus Finch, the protagonist. Even though I had not seen the entire movie, while reading the book I heard Gregory Peck's voice each time I read a line by Atticus. Scout (Mary Bedham), Jem (Phillip Alford), and Dill (Lee's portrait in literature of her friend Truman Capote) are unforgettable characters, as well. The African-American actors are extremely talented, too.

Although I grew up in the 60's and 70's, I can imagine this is very much how things were in 1932 Alabama. Made in 1962, very shortly after the book came out, and in black-and-white, the movie provides the same nostalgic aura as ""The Last Picture Show."" Released immediately prior to the culmination of the Civil Rights Movement, it was way before its time.

The film is wonderful - even though it does not follow the novel strictly, it still captures the essence of the story. Watching the film gave me perspective on the era in which it was written.

52158,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about the idea that to grow up is to overcome prejudice. It tries to prove this idea with three plots, one of each type:

-An external plot seeking justice for a wrongly convicted Tom Robinson
-A relationship plot between the children and Boo Radley
-An internal development plot of the children's maturation

The external plot is the main driver of the story: a black man has been falsely accused of rape by a white woman. Worse, he is wrongly convicted by a jury of white men after having the audacity to declare that he was helping the woman out of pity. This plot results in a failure as Tom is convicted and killed while trying to escape. The plot has a reversal at the end in which the true criminal (and perpetrator of prejudice) is himself killed and his killing is accepted by the law as eye-for-an-eye for Tom.

The external plot unfolds in the formative years of the children and has a distinct impact on their relationship with an ostracized neighbor. They begin by fearing, judging and harassing Boo Radley, only to find that Boo has been helping them from the shadows. The plot ends when the children welcome Boo as a friend.

The internal plot of the maturation of the children makes steady progress. They demonstrate an innate acceptance of others (in sharp contrast with the societal mores) and end up overcoming their own fear of Boo by accepting him as a friend (when even society has not accepted him).

To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story with a great idea: that growing up means overcoming prejudice. It seems to suggest that children have innate goodness and acceptance but can be molded by grownups and society to become blinded or become mature members of society. This contrasts with the idea that prejudice in any shape or form is childish and dangerous trait in adults and society as a whole. The story makes this point by tying together the three plots at the end: Boo kills the man who embodied prejudice to bring late justice for Tom Robinson, Boo does this to save the children, and the children accept him as a friend even though society still shuns him.

It's a great movie.

My only beef is the children's internal arc does not have many negative turning points. Their fighting (seemingly negative) is based on justifiable defending of their father's reputation, their jeering at Boo seems playful and child-like rather than childish and their talking Mr Cunningham out of the lynch mob and taking Boo's hand at the end feels a little caricatured and cringe-inducing. Maybe that's just my own feeling. Overall the point of the story is well taken and appreciated.

This is a movie that every man, woman and child in the U.S. should watch and, if we're lucky, everyone who does see it will be changed for the better.

Very graping and powerful, well made in so many ways. The family unit, the extended family, the dysfunctional family, the good and bad neighbor mix and the pressing points of idealism and the path of doing what's in your power to do. That Scout burst on almsot every scence, in her wonder and take on the world and good ole Jem, following in  the shadow of Actticu, courageous, bold, pushing the edge, defining acts and choices, a Mavrick of sorts.

52185,5,0783225857,"Every now and then, I get the urge to watch a simple, uncomplicated story-line movie,and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" fits the bill. I have watched it, or listened to it, several times, as I sew or draw, or work in my little home-office. Although the subject matter is very painful at times, to watch or to listen to,(I get angry all over again; as I did the first time I watched the movie, especially listening to the court proceedings), I tend to get a strange sense of understanding, as I watch the story play out. The father figure, Gregory Peck, teaches his children, in very well chosen, thought out, loving words about the ugliness, as well as the beauty that this world can bring.  The first time I watched the movie, and found out the fate of the victim on trial, I was horrified, but being the type of person that tends to want to ""see things through"" I continued to watch it, and I'm glad I did. The characters are real, the children so innocent. It is just too bad that ,still, in this day and time, our children's innocence can be changed, in a heart beat, by cruel, insensitive people, and or situations. However, in the end, there is so much that we can learn from this movie, regarding our behavior and or our feelings, towards people in our lives, who are ""different"", than we are. Whether the difference be race, color, gender, poverty, wealth, religious choice, being over weight, being under weight, being ""just too sensitive"" (in our opinions) to situations, or most especially,our tendencies of ""indifference, intolerance, and or inconsideration"", regarding the mentally or physically challenged people of this world, we ""will"" be made to stand accountable for our choices, after it is all said and done. This movie teaches us that we are all in this game of life together, and that we should learn to ""play fair"", respect and appreciate each other, for our diversities.  At the end of the day, that's all that counts.  To me, life would be so boring if everyone thought, looked, acted or even felt, ""just as I do"" about things. Sometimes I just get tired of myself. Please remember that this world does not revolve around ""us"" as individuals.  Sorry,(not really)to get preachy, but this movie gives us lots of food for thought.

52195,5,0783225857,"One of my favorite, all-time movies, that embodies the innocence of childhood, the grace of Southern Charm, and the horrors of racism as we follow three children, two whose father has been assigned to defend a black man accused of beating and raping a young, white woman. It's a story of dignity as Atticus Finch, an honest God-fearing man and father, takes seriously his role to prove the accused as being innocent, and the respect with which he treats the accused and his family.

In the meantime, we follow the lives of the three children during one summer, one who is a summer visitor and based on the life of Truman Capote, who was a neighbor of the story's author Harper Lee. The big mystery for the children is, who lives in the big, old scary house down the block? Their goal in life that summer is to find out who lives there. Most of us who grew up in the era where we had a lot of freedom to play outside and didn't have any fear about it will not only relate to the things those kids get into, but the horror that one hateful,white racist tries to do to Atticus through his children.

Even though this is seen through the eyes of children, I wouldn't recommend it for children, especially young children---it could cause nightmares. Gregory Peck's finest role.",1372896000,,1272,4.5021645021645025

Unlike a lot of folks, I didn't read this book in high school, but later in life in a period when I was reading many of the ""classics"". The book was excellent and the movie is true to the book in both story and nuance. The story is so well told from Scout's eyes. Gregory Peck, in the role of Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is outstanding -- in fact, I can't think of anything I would change about this movie.  Even the minimal (essentially non-speaking) portrayal of Arthur ""Boo"" Radley by a young Robert Duvall is special. What brings me to to tears in this movie is the amazing love that Scout and Gem share ... if you've ever grown up with an older brother or sister you will feel the same.

The lead character, Atticus, is brilliantly portrayed by Gregory Peck. It was interesting to see Robert Duvall as a young man who portrayed a lonely housebound person who really cared about the children who sometimes pestered him because he was different. The fact that children recognize injustice at an early age was evident. I think the themes of injustice,integrity, morality and taking the higher road are obvious in this movie. The cinematography was outstanding given the limitations at the time. This is a movie that is perfect for anyone, particularly families.

Furthermore, this film covered the issue of prejudice when it was still a very explosive subject to many people. Adapted from Harper Lee's classic, this film has a lot of things going for it. This includes a touching story and on of the greatest heroes of all time. It follows the recollections of Scout (Mary Badham) as she remembers her childhood with her older brother Jem and their widowed, lawyer father Atticus. The plot revolves most importantly around the trial of a black man for an accused rape of a white girl. The only man willing to defend Tom Robinson is Atticus because he feels it is the right thing to do. In probably his greatest performance, Gregory Peck portrayed a quiet yet courageous man, Lee had likened to her father. Instantly we are drawn to this well-grounded person who is not always liked or successful for that matter, but who always does what is ultimately right.",1370044800,,1147,4.74

Faithfully adapted from Harper Lee's equally wonderful novel, with great acting performances and production values this film continues to engage viewers with a story line as relevant today as it was on release. Gregory Peck won a well deserved Oscar for his lead role and rightly describes Attichus Finch as his favourite part - and Robert Duvall, on movie debut, almost stops the show in one of my favourite scenes ever.

52251,5,0783225857,"My husband and I watch To Kill a Mockingbird at least once a year, so in the interest of full disclosure, I am not reviewing a movie I just saw for the first time (even though I am responding to Amazons request that I review my most recent watching of it via Amazon Prime last week). This movie is the Benchmark for the definition of Five Stars in my book.  As some pundit once said, it is the which than which there is nothing whicher.  I need fingers and also toes of more than just me to count the number of times I have seen this movie since the first time I watched it when I was in fourth grade in the late 1960s, and my whole family sat riveted, huddled under wool blankets, on our unheated, glassed-in porch that doubled as a TV room in those days.  Even as a fourth-grader, I knew this movie would change my life after I saw it.  Many decades later, I can tell you that it still changes me every time I watch it. The movie bestows wisdom on so many issues, and you will find yourself noticing events in your own life that mirror those unforgettable teachings.  The character development in this film was unprecedented at the time it was made. And the plot was unprecedented for its time too.  In an era when little girls were being sold Easy Bake Ovens and there was no such thing as an alternative family, this movies protagonist is a tomboy (Scout) in a family headed by a man (Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer), and the childrens best friend is a delicate visiting neighbor modeled on Truman Capote.  I regret that almost all of the publicity about this movie has focused on the race relations aspect, only because it misses so much of what makes this movie great.  Admittedly, like everything about this movie, that aspect is groundbreaking, but it would be shortsighted to assume this is a movie about race relations.  The preponderance of the plot goes far beyond. To Kill a Mockingbird is equally a movie about how to learn from misguided assumptions, about recognizing love, and about creative survival. I will stake my life and reputation that this is one of the best films ever made and that will ever be made.  Most films made now have one note themes.  To Kill a Mockingbird covers far more ground.  In this movie, Scouts learning about the impact of the Great Depression on human dignity is profound: her tempestuous interactions with an impoverished schoolmate whose father pays for his legal obligations to Atticus with bags full of nuts are tangible, and you can almost taste the syrup that her classmate pours over his eggs when he joins them for breakfast one day.  The scene where the children learn that their seemingly dull father is actually an accomplished sharp-shooterwhen he kills with one shot a rabid dog threatening the townis unforgettable. Most people who learn about this movie learn about the race relations story of the trial, andas important as that isit missed two thirds of the point of the movieso I will end this review with a comment about the Boo Radley story overlaying the movie.  So as not to spoil the end of the movie for anyone who has not already seen it, let me just say that when the door swings back and it is revealed who saved Scout from being attacked, one realizes who the the mockingbird really is. No one will watch this movie and not feel changed by it.  Years after you watch it, you might hear the movie theme music and feel moved to tears.  Yes, its that good.",1367625600,3,3428,4.487138263665595

When I saw the film, I was first impressed on how up to date the production was. It is difficult to realize that it's 50 years old. I was, of course, impressed with both the directing and acting. There is a sensitivity that underscores everything. Many many reactions are subtle. The pace is always moving, Camera angles portray strengths and weaknesses. I loved it all. The second disc of the set was a long interview with a much older Gregory Peck. Warm and insightful it was, and always interesting.

Brilliant acting, of course. Film is black and white, which my students initially complained about but after five minutes of bemoaning, got over it. With all of the terrible re-makes that have been done over the years, I wonder why no one has ever re-told this story from a cinematic perspective.

52268,5,0783225857,"Several years ago, I was on plane bound for Ohio, and seated next to a child. He was about 6 years old, he held out his tiny hand and introduced himself as ""ATTICUS"". He told me that this parents, who were sitting behind us, had named him after their favourite film character.

This little boy was bright and super intelligent. He told me about the film and why it was so great. He said that his parents, who were both lawyers, wanted to name him after someone who did great things. He told me that he had hoped to do great things too, when he grew up. I hope that he did.

The film, itself, was groundbreaking, a seminal work. The cast in the film: Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch), Phillip Alford (Jem), Mary Badham (Scout), Collin Wilcox (Maybella Ewell), Brock Peters (Tom Robinson) and Robert Duvall (Boo Radley), were wonderful.

I have loved ""Bobby Duvall"", ever since this film...

There is so much in this movie, the complexities of human nature, the love of a parent for his young children, who are growing up in a mis-understood, divided world. The desire to set things right, the need to prove that wrong is wrong and to stand tall in the faces of adversity. This film has it all.

There is nothing more that I could add that has not already been discussed by writers and film makers around the world.

For me, seeing this film in high school and at home and then meeting (many years ago) a little, smart boy on a plane, who  was actually named ""Atticus"", was the height of my experience with this film. The child was a joy to talk to and his understanding and knowledge of the film, was remarkable.  I think of him again, when I watch this movie.

All kinds of themes are worked into the fabric of the book, and I am really glad I finally read it.

To feel the pain of others, and compassion. Our children today are flooded with bad information and behavior. Grand Theft auto should be outlawed as dangerous to our youth and their children mimmic what they see...when it is paraded in front of their eyes...it is in their minds in a distorted way. As their little minds are not mature enough to digest such terrible examples...it will affect their behaviour later. Just look around and you will see it. Sad our government does not care to regulate videos, movies and advertising on television and around town in video stores. Putting women on ads in very immodest clothing, and cigarettes in hands and alcohol in their other hands on billboards.

This movie is filled with so much history on how the south at that  time viewed the black race. This is a movie that should be shown in history classes. The bonus cd is truly a plus. This movie will never get old. I enjoyed listening to SCOUT as an adult telling what it was like to play her role as a child and and what it was like to walk up and just sit in Mr. Peck's lap whenever she wanted.

My son had to read the book for his English class and I thought I would also read it to see what it was about. No wonder this is a classic. I was surprised that a book written in the early 60's that was based on a story in the 1930's could still seem like something that just happened yesterday. The movie sticks to the book mainly with only a few little things taken out. Some people will write reviews and tell you the whole story, but this a story that you need to see for yourself. I really think people should read the book first and then enjoy the movie. According to the story, to kill a mockingbird is a sin. To go through life never experiencing this story, either by reading the book or watching the movie should also be considered a sin.

52361,5,0783225857,"I don't think anybody would question the greatness of the movie.  It just seems to hit on every level, from a screenplay artfully edited from the classic Harper Lee novel, to terrific and believable performances by everybody, especially the child actors; a great score by Elmer Bernstein; the spooky, wordless film debut of Robert Duvall; and of course Gregory Peck as the menschiest cinematic Dad of all time.  It's an unsparing look at racism, put forth before Martin Luther King had a dream, and before the Civil Rights Act.  A classic, and an essential film.
The 50th anniversary repackaging is terrific -- it includes a Blu-Ray with a stunning picture and good sound, a standard def DVD, a downloadable digital copy which looks great on my MacBook and iPad, and a batch of nice extras.  The Blu-Ray comes with a batch of making-of featurettes, a retrospective of Gregory Peck's career, and a Q&A session in which Peck reminisces about his career, especially the making of Mockingbird.  And the booklet has essays by Peck's wife Veronique, by Harper Lee, and -- this is especially nifty for actors out there -- reproductions of three pages of Peck's personal copy of the shooting script, with his dense annotations, edits, and notes which show the prodigious work that went into this remarkably low-key, understated performance.  it's revelatory to watch the scenes in question with the script in front of you.

52404,5,0783225857,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is in my estimation, and many others, the single most important piece of work to ever come out of Hollywood. The movie covers much more than just racism. It's a tale of how judging others without knowledge is as dangerous and illiterate as a murderer. Unfortunately our society has embraced judging others, whether by media influence or just plain ignorance. It is a tale of growing up in a society that doesn't practice what it preaches (pun intended). It's the story of a man whose entire life boils down to the simplest of emotions, empathy.

Why is it that a movie loved and universally praised can't be used as a blueprint for the society from which it came and today's society as well? Have we truly become so enamored of our own self-serving interests that we can't see what it's doing to our world.

I don't know about anyone one else, but aside from my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Atticus Finch, fictitious though he may be, is a personal role model for my life, and has been since I first read the book in third grade. I would give anything and everything I own to see the evolution of mankind take on the characteristics of Atticus Finch, Scout, Jem (and, Lord forgive me, no more of those whose main goal in life seems to be to make the whole world about them).",1352851200,,1299,4.476793248945148

After more than half a century, Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch still stands as a towering figure of decency, integrity and courage that we should all seek to emulate. Having first seen it at 10 years old, I don't know that anything could so encapsulate and convey the importance of empathy, as with Atticus' treatment of Tom Robinson and Boo Radley.

52420,5,0783225857,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of the finest stories ever put on film; and the hero of that story, Atticus Finch (who is played by the incomparable Gregory Peck), has to be one of the most admirable characters ever portrayed on the silver screen.  If I could give this move more than five stars, I would.  But, since I can only give it five stars, I'll have to be content with that.  But please note that my five-star rating is for the movie itself, not for the special features included on this disc, which I found to be something of a letdown, in all honesty.  (More on this later.)  But the movie itself deserves the highest rating I can give it.  It is a cinematic masterpiece that everyone ought to see.

In 1960, Harper Lee (a childhood friend of celebrated writer Truman Capote), published her only novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", which was based loosely on her own childhood memories of growing up in the small, sleepy, Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, during the Great Depression.  Lee maintains that the novel is not autobiographical, since many of the events it depicts are fictional; but the setting and characters are based on the places and people she knew as a child.  The narrator, Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, is based on Harper Lee herself.  Scout's devoted father, the respected local attorney, Atticus Finch, is based on Lee's own father, who was a lawyer.  And Dill Harris, the boy who spent his summers living at his aunt's house next door to the Finches, is based on Truman Capote.  Even the reclusive Radley family, who rarely ventured outside of their spooky, boarded-up house down the street from the Finches, is based on an actual family who lived near the Lees.  They, too, had a mysterious son they kept hidden from view because they were ashamed of him, just like Boo Radley in the novel.  In fact, most of the characters in the novel were based, at least loosely, on real people Harper Lee knew as a child.  Perhaps that's part of the reason why this story feels so real.  The portrait that Lee paints of life in the Depression-era Deep South is not only realistic, but vivid and nuanced.  She is able to honestly portray the hardships of poverty and the evils of racism that she witnessed as a child without ever crossing the line into caricature, and without in any way undermining her nostalgic portrayal of the magical innocence of childhood.

""To Kill a Mockingbird"" became a runaway bestseller, and ended up winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.  And, even though the plot of the novel was not obviously well-suited to be adapted for the silver screen, it was made into a major motion picture the following year, with one of the biggest names in Hollywood, Gregory Peck, as its star.  The movie wasn't able to depict everything that happened in the book, of course.  (No movie ever can.)  But we are fortunate that the talented screenwriter, Horton Foote, was able to find the essence of the story in Harper Lee's novel and turn it into a brilliant screenplay.  What we end up with is a film that doesn't feel like a typical Hollywood movie.  Instead, it feels more like an actual look at someone's bittersweet memories of childhood.

I'm no literary critic; so I won't even attempt to plumb the depths of this story.  It's far too rich for even a cursory exploration of its many themes in a review such as this.  But I do want to comment very briefly on what I believe to be the single greatest thing about this story: the character of Atticus Finch.  There are few people I can think of -- either in the real world or in works of fiction -- who are even remotely as admirable as Atticus Finch.  I find it hard to even imagine a better role model for a young person (especially a young man) to emulate.  He represents, at least in my view, the ideal father, the ideal lawyer, the ideal citizen, the ideal gentleman, and perhaps even the ideal human being.  As a father, he sets a good example for his children, treats them with respect and kindness, nurtures them, allows them a measure of independence, encourages their curiosity, answers their questions as honestly as he can, tries his best to instill in them the right values, and gently explains things to them rather than lecturing them or yelling at them.  As a lawyer, he has the highest possible standards of ethics and integrity, genuine compassion for his clients, a non-cynical respect for the law, and a commitment to justice.  As a citizen, he is dutiful, respectful, trustworthy, hospitable, neighborly, tolerant, and unbigoted.  As a gentleman, he is humble, peaceable, dignified, self-controlled, stalwart, courageous, and polite.  And, as a human being, he is virtuous, kind, empathetic, hopeful, and wise.  I wish I were even half the man that Atticus Finch is.  The world would be a much better place if it had more Atticus Finches in it.

This is a movie that everyone ought to watch.  Not only is it a good story, with wonderful characters and a fascinating setting; but it also has some great lessons to teach about life, and about what it means to be a decent, honorable person.  Everyone needs to be exposed to the example of Atticus Finch, who is one of the noblest heroes ever portrayed on film.  I can't praise this movie highly enough; nor can my words do justice to it.  You've simply got to see it for yourself.

Unfortunately, my five-star review has to come with this caveat:  While the movie itself is great, the special features on this disc are, at least in my view, underwhelming at best.  The documentary ""Fearful Symmetry"", which tells the story of the real-life people and places behind the novel, and how the novel was turned into a movie, is pretty interesting. And, being a total geek, I actually enjoyed the mini documentary on film restoration that was included on this disc, which showed how various old movies, including ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", have been restored for digital release on DVD and Blu-ray.  But the other special features didn't really appeal to me all that much.  I think that Gregory Peck was a brilliant actor and an admirable human being; but the Gregory Peck hagiography on this disc simply went too far, in my opinion.  The special features included with this motion picture should have been about the movie itself, or about Harper Lee's story, rather than about the star of the film.  But four of the nine special features on this disc were about the life and career of Gregory Peck, and a fifth (an interview with Mary Badham, who played Scout in the movie) spent more time talking about what a great person Gregory Peck was than about anything else.  For starters, there was a feature-length documentary that Peck's daughter co-produced, chronicling her father's reminiscences during his later years when he went on tour holding Q&A sessions before live audiences, which I might have enjoyed had it been edited down to a more reasonable length of half-an-hour or so, but which was simply exhausting at its actual running time of 97 minutes.  In addition to this there were two very short clips showing Gregory Peck giving acceptance speeches, first for his Best Actor Oscar for his performance in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", and second for his Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.  He didn't really have much to say on either occasion; so I'm not sure why these were included.  But what really puzzled me was the inclusion of a poor-quality, amateur video recording of Peck's daughter speaking at a ceremony honoring her late father after his death.  I found these special features a bit disappointing.  But they can't take away from the overall quality of the movie.  I seriously doubt that anyone bases their decision about whether or not to buy a movie on the quality of the special features included on the disc.  Even if there were no special features on this disc at all, the movie would still be worth buying; and I highly recommend it.",1348099200,2,7925,4.698044895003621

52424,5,0783225857,"I was born and raised in the state of Alabama so To Kill a Mockingbird was both a great story and provided wonderful historical backgroup for me.  The young actress who played Scout was also from Alabama, Birmingham, in fact, near where I am from.  Mary Badham was fantastic.  She reminded me of my older sister, overalls, short hair cut and all.  I remember going to Birmingham when I was a little girl to see this movie when it first came out.  Going out to a movie was a big deal for a nine-year old and seeing a little girl about my age from my area appear in a Hollywood movie put me over the moon.  As I saw this movie again I relived all of these feelings.  This is a wonderful movie no matter where you are from.  There are no car chases and while guns figure in to the plot there are no shoot-em ups. There is a bit of a mystery and big scare for Scout and her brother.  There is also wonderful acting and great entertainment.",1347408000,,935,4.15

The acting is fantastic (including some of the most natural child performances you've ever likely to see), the score is magnificent, and the film is very well-made.

As part of Universal's 100th Anniversary, To Kill a Mockingbird has been given an all new restoration. The result is breathtaking. This is one of the clearest and most beautiful transfers for a film of this age I've seen. The sound, while slightly held back due to this being a 50-year old movie, also fares very well.

This release is packed many worthwhile and insightful extras, particularly a feature-length documentary and commentary.

A timeless masterpiece earns an equally impressive blu-ray release.",1345593600,,833,5.110294117647059

When I finished the copy I borrowed from the library, I suddenly realized how much I enjoyed reading it again and wondered why I did not have a copy in my own library. I'm glad this edition was available and have added it to my collection of favorite books. What a great example of southern culture of that time and the courage of a man for whom choosing to do the right thing was more important than what might happen afterwards.

It looks like it was filmed yesterday with great contrast and luminosity. I didn't see a scratch during all the viewing. The sound was also wonderful on my home theatre, you could hear a lot of subtilities with the 5.1 DTS soundtrack that you couldn't with the soundtrack on my copy on DVD. It's a very pleasant experience to enjoy a classic like this in your home, I felt like I was somewhere in a movie theatre in 1962. Also, they're not cheap with the extras, there's more than the original DVD which was pretty full also. I like the featurette showing how they restore the Universal classics, very informative. I loved the movie experience so much that I bought The Deer hunter also from that 100th anniversary of Universal studios. Same thing, the picture was amazing,very colorful and rich. The sound was not perfect but I'm sure they did whatever they could for the best possible result.

It may be as good as it's going to get, but I'm hoping there's a better copy to come where faces aren't a bit washed out in the bright light, and the detail is a bit crisper.

Watching this film has something of the opposite impact--it makes one appreciate the depth of talent displayed and that writers, directors, and actors actually had to rely on the storyline and acting for films to succeed. This is one that did and does.

Some of the ""special features"" drag a bit, but it is interesting to hear Gregory Peck talk about the film and to experience his wit and humor. Again, ""behind the scenes"" isn't about how things get blown up or car crashes are staged. It's about the heart and soul of the film, the characters and the actors who portrayed them.

In a word, ""Recommended.""

While some kids might groan at the black and white images and lack of ""action,"" it's good family viewing. There's a lot to experience and a lot to talk about.",1337990400,,881,4.707792207792208
52442,5,0783225857,"The 50th Anniversary Edition of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a fantastic 2-disc set that gives this American classic the treatment it deserves.  The film itself is crystal clear, the sound (and score) are magnificent, and the bonus features included in this package alone are worth the price of admission.  The making-of documentary, Fearful Symmetry, is particularly well done.

TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD chronicles a small town rocked by a racially-charged court case as seen through the eyes of an innocent young girl.  This movie is superbly written and acted, there doesn't appear to be a wasted frame in the entire running time.  The story here (much like its source material) is heartwarming, heartbreaking, tear-jerking, and laugh-out-loud funny.  This movie has received a lot of attention and hype over its year, and it is all well-earned.  I'm glad to say that this film has stood the test of time.

If you have not seen TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD before, this is definitely worth a purchase.  If you have seen this movie before, but outside of this 50th Anniversary Edition, it's still worth a buy for the fantastic quality and bonus features.",1337644800,,1142,4.93717277486911
52443,5,0783225857,"It has been years since Ive seen this movie and it is still a great movie. Nice clear picture, glad they didn't colorize it. Disappointed that this wasn't one of the Prime movies.",1337472000,,179,4.454545454545454
52444,5,0783225857,"Released in 1962, To Kill a Mockingbird ranks #34 on the AFI top 100 movie list and shows clearly just how powerful a classic movie can be. Where many movies fade and wither in time, To Kill a Mockingbird remains just as powerful, just as memorable as when it was first filmed. In other movies the characters can feel dated. The acting can seem shoddy. People make excuses about ""well, it was only the 1960s. What can you expect."" THIS is what you can expect. The dialogue is stellar. The acting is superb. Even in black and white, even with the limited technology available, you get sucked in, immersed, and feel the full reality of what is going on. This is what high quality movie making is all about.

The movie is a perfect window into events which were all too familiar during the Great Depression. People struggled to get by. They had to try to pay their bills with crops grown in their back yard. People with mental illness were treated little better than dogs. Women were beaten. Into all of this comes young Scout, a girl growing up with her older brother and widowed father. She is a tomboy, eager to speak out and fight for her cause. The worst thing her brother can accuse her of is acting like a ""girl"". She has strong ideals and is not afraid to voice them.

Her father, a lawyer, is tapped to represent a local black man who has been accused of raping a white woman. Most of the town wants to lynch the poor accused man, although some townsfolk see the injustice of it. Scout leaps into fights with her schoolmates to defend the honor of her father. And ironically, when her father is threatened, it is her willingness to speak up and say what she feels that helps to soothe the situation.

I can't say enough good things about this film. Gregory Peck is incredible. He gives just the right touch to so many scenes. You can see in his eyes the mix of emotions as he stands strong on the steps before the mob. When his son is hurt, and he's standing outside the window trying desperately to figure out what to do, my heart ached for him. His strength in the courtroom, and his tenderness with his kids is just stunning.

I have seen this movie many times, and I look forward to seeing it many more. Every time someone tries to make a case for a shoddy movie from the 60s or 50s, claiming ""well it's just how movies were made back then"", I point to this one. THIS is how fine movies were made in this time period. This shows great acting, great dialogue, and a mix of characters who are authentic and interesting and respectful of their origins. The mentally ill man is not treated as a joke. He is a real human being. The drunkard father, the lying daughter, and the plight of the black members of the community are all shown with clarity and realism.

It is a minor, interesting note, that despite the movie seeming to revolve around women, they never talk with each other! It's all about how men impact their lives. Scout is central but she is primarily talked to by her father and brother. Those are the influences she cares about. Only briefly does the nanny character talk with her. Similarly, the lying daughter is another key character but she is only ever talked to / at by the lawyer and her father. The movie is about how the women are handled / guided by men. I think the only time a female really talks to any of these women is when the nanny scolds Scout for how she behaves to a guest. That's the one instance in the entire film.

Highly recommended in the strongest possible words. Everyone should see this film.",1337212800,,3542,4.391768292682927

52471,5,0783225857,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY VERSION ***

In April 2012 Universal Studios is 100 years old - and to celebrate that movie centenary - they've had 13 of their most-celebrated films fully restored for BLU RAY. But it doesn't stop there. As many as 80 other titles will be given re-launches across the year as well - each featuring distinctive ""100th Anniversary"" card-wrap packaging and in many cases a host of new features. Most (not all) of these re-issues will be two-disc sets containing the Blu Ray, the DVD and also means to obtain a Digital Copy via download.

1962's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the thirteen singled out for full restoration (see list below) - and an absolute peach it is too.

Released 10 January 2012 - it comes in a gorgeous limited edition 'book pack' (Barcode 5050582881844). The outer hardback holder has a card-pouch wrapped around it at the base and a 45-page booklet contained within. The book has interviews with Veronique Peck (his wife of 40 plus years), Harper Lee (author of the 1960 novel), pictures of the Shooting Script, Original Storyboards, Original Posters and Lobby Cards (from around the world), Press Book Excerpts and even Correspondence surrounding the movie (telegrams of congratulations from Fred Astaire, Betty Bacall and Charlton Heston). It's a visual feast with loads of photos peppering the wonderful memorabilia. Universal are to be praised for this because it absolutely looks the part. But the real fireworks comes in the other two elements at play here - the extensive extras - and the glorious new print...

Digitally remastered and Fully Restored from Original Film Elements - Universal are reputed to have stumped-up over $300,000 for the restoration - and the results are BEAUTIFUL. Even from the opening logo and credits of a child drawing - there are no lines or scratches of any kind - and the black and white cinematography of 1930's Alabama is fantastically clear. Stand-out clarity - the scene where the accused black man Tom Robertson is sweating in the courtroom as he relays his side of the story (a superlative Brock Peters - he read the Eulogy at Peck's funeral in 2003 at Peck's request), Atticus's son Jem is in his dad's car outside the family home of the black Robertson family as the hateful Bob Ewell looks on, the three children watching from the bushes as the mob try to take the jail with Atticus guarding the doorway, Atticus explaining what happened to Tom Robertson after the trial as the moonlight shines on his suit, the young girl Scout pointing out the simpleton Boo Radley behind the bedroom door (Robert Duvall's stunning cinematic debut where he doesn't utter a word but leaves an indelible mark) - it's all suddenly gorgeous. And the sound is rounded and clean too. An exemplary job.

The extras are equally superb - the centrepiece of which is a near one and half-hour documentary called ""A Conversation With..."" It's a feast for Peck fans - interviews with Barry Norman in 1974, Terry Wogan in 1979 and other notables throughout the years are peppered with home movies and footage of Peck giving a one-on-one show to a Virginia audience in 1999. It's a raconteur tour-de-force a la David Niven - an 83-year old Peck is generous, charming, witty, responsive - full of anecdotes about Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Harper Lee. We get stories about meeting his wife in Paris just before shooting for ""Roman Holiday"" began - there's footage of dinner with the President of France Jacques Chirac and his family - a visit to Niagara Falls with his daughter Cecilia (handshakes with an adoring public) - US President Bill Clinton giving Peck the National Medal Of Arts and dropping it! But most of all as the minutes pass by you 'get' why Gregory Peck was greeted with such staggering affection everywhere he went in the world - he literally exuded 'good guy' from his every pore - that old style Hollywood class - a talented giant who didn't have a mean bone in his body. It's joyful stuff to watch.

The movie itself has entered into folklore - released in 1962 and filmed in Black and White - it primarily centres on a black man accused of raping a white woman and the trial that follows. Such was the power of the story - and especially Peck's central performance as the principled lawyer Atticus Finch (his only Oscar win) it literally inspired members of the public to take up the law as a profession and even impacted on America's turbulent and changing racial landscape of the time. The performances by the children as innocents are particularly superb too - but it's Peck who dominates the whole thing with a gravitas and sincerity that few actors could match. His stand against bigotry is magnificent and filled with a quiet decency that has touched audiences for decades. As if sensing the importance of the part, Peck's scrawl is all over the shooting script - to the point that it often obliterates the text - the four words he scribbled on the last page describing the character he plays title this review - and describe the great man himself.

To sum up - with the 1930 anti-war masterpiece ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" also being amongst the first vanguard of these 'restored' releases - it's heartening to see Universal Studios finally throw some proper money at the preservation of its movie legacy - and be proud about doing so too. I for one will collect the whole series - and live in hope that other studios respect their past in the same glorious way.

An absolutely first-class release - and then some.

52472,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird remains my all-time favorite movie and this new restoration for it's 50th anniversary is amazing, Universal has done a really good job restoring this black and white classic and it looks better than ever! Gregory Peck's performance is unique and really powerful! Any fan of this movie needs to add this to their collection!",1330732800,,345,4.9655172413793105
52473,5,0783225857,I received my DVD quicker than I thought I would. It was exactly as advertised. That's what I want. Great!,1330128000,,106,4.35
52474,5,0783225857,"NOTE: This review is based on the 2012 Blu-ray Collectors' Edition Combo. Amazon has an odd policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions of a movie that is released on home video. So, to make the most use of the hundreds of reviews listed for TKAM, click on the ""show all reviews"" link and then sort by ""Newest First"". Then look at date of the review. Now on to my review:

First off, I've always loved this film and it was the story, acting and the photography that always captured me since I saw the film when it was released. It was in black and white (and growing up we only had a black and white TV, so I was used to this). The film looked ""okay"" on VHS and then, in 1998 Universal released it on DVD in a Collector's Edition. This included the film plus a full length commentary and the (then) new feature-length documentary. This was great.. but the film had not been ""restored"".

Now Universal has restored it and the print is great. They brought back the above noted bonus features and added more! The bonuses amount to more viewing time than the feature film (almost four times!). The DVD version of the new release contains all the featurettes while the Blu-ray combo pack Collectors' Edition ads the book with rare photos etc and high-def of the special features. So if you don't have a BD player yet you won't miss out on the wonderful special features. And if you have not seen the documentary before, it will blow you away. (By the way, after you've absorbed ALL the featurettes on this set, seek out the new documentary, ""Hey Boo, Harper Lee and To Kill a Mockingbird"" which I reviewed last year. Both of these DVDs belong in every home.

For all the material on this marvelous set from Universal, a copy belongs in every home - especially one with pre-teen and teenage children. And with a selling price on Amazon as low as it is, there is no reason not to buy a copy now! Thank you Universal for going the extra mile.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

52475,5,0783225857,"Fantastic!! is all I can say about this American classic! Universal did one hell of a job restoring this film, it looks like it was shot yesterday. I'm glad that they left it in black and white.

I do not feel it necessary to review this classic film. Unless the subject matter is not suitable for one's age, everyone in the free world has surely seen the film entitled, To Kill a Mockingbird, or at the very least read the book. If not, shame on your High School English teacher! To Kill a Mockingbird was required reading when I was in High School & I could not put the book down until I had turned the very last page! To say that it is a page turner is not only redundant, it is also an understatement. However, this review is about the Blu-Ray not the book. Needless to say, I was absolutely thrilled to learn that To Kill a Mockingbird was showing in my home town movie theater. Having read the book, my sister & I absolutely could not wait to see the film. We no sooner returned home from the movie theater when we agreed to change the names of our two Finches (tiny caged birds). Mine was renamed Atticus Finch & my sister chose the name Scout Finch. Thus, I have read the book which remains on my bookshelf to this very day, purchased a ticket to watch To Kill a Mockingbird when it was initially released in movie theaters & I own the film version on both VHS & DVD. Yet I could not manage to resist purchasing this 50TH Anniversary Edition on Blu-Ray, DVD & Digital Copy for the incredibly reasonable price offered by Amazon. The Remastered Blu-Ray quality is truly excellent. Thankfully it remains in Black & White. There are many Bonus Features. So many in fact that I have no doubt it could take  several weeks to view all. The interviews with the actors are extremely interesting & entertaining. A true fan of the film To Kill a Mockingbird cannot go wrong with this set. It comes with two discs, one DVD, the other Blu-Ray, along with instructions about how to download the Digital Copy from your PC. The Blu-Ray is in 1080p High Definition Widescreen 1.85:1 which is apparent as once again, the picture quality is just incredible. The DVD is Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1. Both are in English & French but surprisingly not Spanish & both have English, Spanish & French subtitles. Some of the Special Features are in 1080i/p High Definition & some in 480i/p Standard Definition. I highly recommend this 50TH Anniversary Edition of the enduring classic film, To Kill a Mockingbird!",1328918400,15,2678,4.924778761061947
52477,5,0783225857,Universal is definitely getting its act together with film restoration. To Kill A Mockingbird looks like it was shot yesterday. I'm mystified that some person dissed the visual quality of this blu-ray. Guess you can't please some people even if you do a fantastic job... like with this title! Not much need to discuss the film. It's a classic. What can you say? Peck's greatest role. A story that still resonates after all these years.,1328745600,3,435,4.8133333333333335
52478,5,0783225857,"Wow! Cannot get over how great this picture looks for being from 1962! Universal did an amazing job on this restoration for blu ray. No matter what other people say on here, there is vertually no DNR used. Grain is intact (which might bother some people) and the detail is excellent! Cannot get over how clear this print looks. Cannot wait to see Universal's blu ray of All Quiet on the Western Front. The documentary on their restoration process is awesome! Just wished it was more detailed, but they get their message across. There are tons of extras to enjoy on this blu ray. I still yet have not watched the DVD from this set, because once you go blu ray...why go backwards in formats?
Universal did an outstanding job on this particular release and I cannot recommend this blu ray enough.
Please Universal, treat more of your classics with this much respect. We movie lovers love these awesome restorations the studios are doing instead of using old prints.
What a way to start Universal's 100th Anniversary with a great transfer like To Kill a Mockingbird in HD.",1328572800,8,1068,4.6861702127659575
52479,1,0783225857,"The single star is for the blu-ray transfer, obviously not for the movie. I just saw the Spanish edition of this blu-ray, which I assume to be the same, digibook included. I guess Universal has released the same transfer everywhere, so this can apply to all blu-ray edtions of this wonderful movie. Even though Harper Lee's book is of course denser in detail and much richer, which always happens because books and movies are different media, I still think it is a fairly good, unpretentious, touching adaptation. I usually dislike kids in US movies, but these are truly an exception, they are just adorable. All actors are outstanding, and of course Gregory Peck's understating acting is truly exceptional. Not to mention the very brief, breathtaking appearence by Robert Duvall at the end of the movie. Elmer Berstein's score is a true classic, simply marvelous. The photography is also beautiful but...yes, the transfer is, once more, fairly disappointing. They have abused DNR once more and the result, although not as badly preposterous as, let's say, ""Sleepy Hollow"" or ""Out of Africa"", is still quite sad. Details are lost, borders appear blurry at times, and, most sadly of all, faces are rather waxy, very waxy at times. I just don't understand the obsession for getting rid of the celulloid grain, which was a natural part of movies for many decades; it was the way these wonderful movies were shot and watched in theaters for generations. Comparison with other black & white classics on blu-ray such as ""Night of the hunter"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"" enhances all that is miserably lost in this one. A real shame. One would think that after the ""Gladiator"" affair, which had to be re-released with a new remastering toning donwn the DNR, this mistake would never be made again. But it does seem Universal is getting pretty good at spoiling wonderful movies. After watching the short documentary ""100 years of Universal: restoring the classics"" one feels really sorry that so much effort and care is spoiled at the very end with the absurd DNR obsession. They are even proud of removing the natural celulloid grain, and, gee, that is really upsettting!! Specially in the samples from this very movie, where you can see faces loosing detail and turning waxy as they show the restoration in process...One also fears the worst for future releases. Please, Universal, don't do crimes like this anymore.",1328400000,23,2414,4.977722772277228
52480,5,0783225857,I absolutely love everything about this movie. It's just so intriguing to me. It makes me want to go back and live in the Great Depression. Strange. I know.,1328140800,,156,4.413793103448276
52481,5,0783225857,"The 411 by Maria:
Unlike a lot of my friends, I don't recall having to read this book in school but then again, that was a long time ago. If I am going to watch or read something, I don't like to read the synopsis so I had no idea what the movie was about when I started.

The movie is set in the 1930's and focus on Atticus Finch played magnificently by Gregory Peck and his two children, Jem and Scout (more on them later). Atticus is a respected attorney who has been commissioned to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a woman in her own home.

What I Can Tell You:
Wow, where do I start. I was completely floored with this movie. Gregory Peck performance is completely stunning! The fact that he won best actor for the role was not lost on me, completely worthy of it and one of the best acting I have ever seen. However, after seeing some of the bonus features, I believe he was pretty much playing himself!  A gentle, kind soul, whose thoughtfulness and mannerisms bring out the best in those around him. He allows, after a gentle nudge to make their own assumptions and mistakes in life in hopes of becoming a better person.

The actress who played Scout was unbelievably ""real"". You would never believe that this child was not Gregory Peck's daughter. There is real love there and I was n awe of how much acting had to be done. Most emotions were seen not heard. Without the use of a soundtrack and a whole lot of dialogue these actors really have to ACT! You can hear everything. The actors are not bogged down with dialogue, the scene is set, and you act!

The quietness of the whole movie is really what got me. When I discussed it with people after watching, those who have seen or have not, that was what I mentioned most. I appreciated the quietness. For such a sensitive subject matter, I felt that if this was being done today, the deepness of it would be lost in translation.

I have so many favorite scenes:

  Scout saying goodnight to her father and asking what he has to pass on to her when he is gone.
  Brock Peters taking the stand. His emotion was so real!
  Atticus speaking to his children. He is such a gentle, caring man who obviously loves his children.
  Scout and Jem's relationship. Anytime they were on the screen I was in love.
  Scout talking to the gang who headed to the jail to take the law in their own hands. Her innocence was palpable.
  Scout talking to Boo Radley after he helped her and her brother.

If you do get the Blu-ray, take time to watch the bonus features. Truly a blessing to have this footage. Well worth your time.

To Kill a Mockingbird won Academy Awards for Best Actor (Peck), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Art Direction. Truly a classic and one that everyone should watch.  This is when acting was actually acting. No green screens, no classy soundtracks, no glamorous special effects, just acting at its finest.",1327881600,3,2897,4.406015037593985
52482,5,0783225857,"I have seen this movie many times in the past, but this version of the film brings out the best in the movie and completes make your senses delight in the literary masterpiece which is this film. Not only does the story itself intrigue the viewer, but the acting is completely top rate and Gregory Peck alone is remarkable in his role (in my opinion, it was made for him). What makes this version different than the rest, it has to be a combination of the high definition that the blu-ray provides but also on top of this all of the special features that have been provided for the viewer. This movie is jam-packed with so many behind the scenes as well as interesting tidbits that you would have never known about the movie.

""Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between.  Boo was our neighbor.  He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives.

One time, Atticus said you never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them.  Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.

The summer that had begun so long ago had ended, and another summer had taken its place, and a fall, and Boo Radley had come out.

I was to think of these days many times ... of Jem and Dill and Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, and Atticus.  He would be in Jem's room all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.""

52486,5,0783225857,"My all time favorite movie. A true classic. Great cast lead by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch who won the oscar for best actor. I have lost count how mant times I have seen this movie but it is for sure the one movie I have seen the most. I was about 10 maybe when I first saw it. As a kid I was fasinated by thr three kids in the movie (Jem,Scout and Dill) who in turn was always fascinated in trying to get a look at Boo Radley, the towns notorious crazy man. As I grew older and became more aware of the civil rights movement and racial prejudice the part of the movie involving Tom Robinson, a black man accused of beating and raping a white girl, became of main interest to me. Atticus does a wonderful job of showing Tom could not have committed what he is accused of. He does this all the while knowing that the jury will find his client guilty because of the color of his clients skin. My favorite scene in the movie is when Gregory Peck gives the closing argument to the jury. A great speech which I feel shows Gregory Peck at his absolute best as an actor. There are many other outstanding scenes in the movie. Too many to mention. You just got to take the time to watch this if the chance ever arrives. It is a movie with no car chases or gun play or bloody fights or big budget special effects. To Kill A Mockingbird just relies on human emotion and the power of the spoken word.

52492,3,0783225857,"While attending a a film class at a San Diego community college back in the 80's, the instructor told is how badly Hitchcock's classic horror film, PSYCHO, was structured. His chief complaint is how the film spends twenty to twenty-five minutes on a character which we never see again and how everything is wrapped up so neatly by another character, the psychologist, who appears only in the last two or three minutes! Well. if the screenplay of PSYCHO has a bad structure--TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD takes the cake! I haven't read the prize-winning Harper Lee semiautobiographical novel, but if my nephew had written a similarly-structured script for his Walter screenwriting class at UCLA, it would have been thrown out!

First of all, the film is divided in two parts. Sorry, but this is a film--not a two act play. The first half concentrates on Scout and really builds up her character. The second half is sedentary court-room drama. So, Mr. Foote, Ms Lee, WHO'S STORY IS IT???

Boo Radley's father is a peripheral character and could have easily been omitted. If I recall, and I just watched the film the other day after over twenty-five years, he doesn't even have a line of dialogue!

 Worse still, and equal to the first point I mention above, is the visual introduction of the Boo charcter after two hours of light on a screen! It's almost like a thankless role, and yet he is the symbolic ""mockingbird"" of the tale. He's not just Simon Oakland wrapping things up and making all ends meet as he does in the final minutes of PSYCHO.

Don't get me wrong, it is a most well intentioned film and well-timed as far as the socio-political events unfolding in the country at the time, but in addition to Foote's poor structure, Robert Mulligan was just the wrong director for this heavy theme.

I saw it on VHS and I can't remember if it was the late producer Alan Pakula or not, who says in a short interview segment following the film, that no film had ever been made at that time which was from a child's POV. Err, excuse me, Mr. Pakula, ever heard of Rene' Clement's JEUX INTERDITS (Forbidden Games, 1952)? Also, the original trailer is shown at the beginning before the movie. One of the the film critic quotes says to ""take the whole family."" LOL A film that deals partially with a man unjustly accused of rape!!!??? LOL",1316304000,3,2324,4.628640776699029

(""Enjoyable"" might be the wrong word, here.  I think ""disturbing"" might be truer.)  Gregory Peck plays a widower with a young daughter, who live in the South.  As an attorney, he is defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. The story is hard to watch, at times, but it delves deep into the best of men and the worst of men.  I think the movie is a realistic view of the place and time, perfectly cast, not corny or sappy.

Gregory Peck rocked the Oscars that year (1962) by taking home the trophy, and he surely deserved it. Peck, as Atticus Finch, is an inspirational movie hero who will stick with you for years to come. The character of Atticus Finch does an amazing job standing up for what he believes in regarding racial justice in 1930s Alabama, regardless of how it might cause others to treat him. Although black and white, the film's mystery, suspense and family drama keeps this movie intriguing and entertaining even by today's standards. Mary Badham as Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, is a stand-out at just 7 or 8 years old. She was incredibly convincing, and could show a wide range of emotions on her young face. Sagel Friendsmith wrote her Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment Test Essay on this legendary movie and earned the highest score in her entire school.

A lawyer in a small Southern town, he's approached after dark to represent a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Although in that time and place a trial would just be a formality, Atticus Finch (played impeccibly by Gregory Peck) agrees to represent the defendant.  As a sub-plot, Finch's children amuse themselves in the pre-television era.  There are the endearing interactions between Atticus and his children.  In a dinner-time conversation, Atticus explains that when he got a shotgun as a child, he was told he could shoot any bird but that it was a sin to kill a mockingbird (and thereby explains the title of the book).  Harper Lee portrays small town life during the depression with great detail and the movie brings this out.  Any remake of the film would be simply superfluous.",1293148800,,976,4.6608187134502925

Over the years, I had seen tidbits of this movie on TV, so it was a real treat to finally view it in its entirety.

Narrated in voice-over by ""Scout,"" we first glimpse the Southern lifestyle of the thirties as three children explore their neighborhood.  They are obsessed with catching a glimpse of Boo Radley, about whom much has been whispered amongst the neighbors.  Like many rumors, there is much more to the story, which will become apparent toward the end of the movie.

The stark black and white images perfectly depicted the settings and the deprivation of this small town world.  Yet despite their lack of material trappings, the children found plenty to amuse themselves, utilizing their minds and their imaginations.

The themes of the film are fear, racism, and integrity--and the latter trait was depicted most notably by Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch.

The lessons in understanding and empathy came specifically from Atticus, as spoken to his children:  You never really know a person until you walk for awhile in his shoes.

Gregory Peck offers what may be his definitive role (he won the Best-Actor Oscar for it after four fruitless nominations) and, perhaps, the most famous dad in film; as various critics have said, not even Peck himself was as good a father as Atticus Finch, but Atticus is probably what every dad wants to be.  Though slow in pace, the movie is never boring, and the picture it presents of the Deep South (Maycomb Co., Ala.) in the days before Martin Luther King is both fascinating and disturbing.

While unfortunate, the movie still captures how he stands out as the Good vs. the Evil of the racist ""Bob"" Ewell. However, this is a movie so, things get compressed.

However, Gregory Peck is truly amazing as Atticus Finch, bringing the character to life. I dare say, if I ever read the book again, I'll visualize most of these actors and actresses. 5 star adaptation, 5 star story, 5 star acting. What else could you ask for?

But the movie posters - which always show Scout and Jem - warned that the film was ""Not Suitable for Children"". Looking back over the history of the novel and film, and how the novel, especially, has been embraced by schools and young people, the posters show what a naive and parochial country America still was in 1962 - but not for much longer. But no matter, both are a ""must read"" and ""must watch"", and will be for generations of young people to come.",1278720000,,823,4.493333333333333
52539,5,0783225857,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of the few examples where novel and movie for one really have something to say and where both versions are outstanding achievements in their own field. Harper Lee's bestseller won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the movie - made with Lee's support and produced with the same love for the material - received eight nominations for the Academy Award. The film won three, including the Best Actor Award for Gregory Peck. Peck really epitomises the role of the Southern lawyer Atticus Finch who defends a black man accused of rape, convinced of his innocence. Finch has his two children to teach values of humanity, and these are based on compassion, courage and fighting for the right cause. What makes this movie so special is that the happenings are seen through the eyes of the children rather than the adults, and thus the storytelling provides an unusual and fresh angle when we find ourselves stumbling into events and learn what's really at stake as the youngsters go along. Yet while Atticus' fight against prejudices may seem to be doomed, hope never ends - and it is a given that the viewer will walk away deeply moved by this movie.

The plot of the movie, told in a retrospective narration, is extraordinary and entirely in the spirit of the novel, evoking the full spectrum of emotions. There's also no doubt about it that the acting is outstanding, not only as far as Peck is concerned but also the child actors, especially Mary Badham, really impress. A lot of credit has to be given to the staff as they created the kind of environment to let the children blossom. Also the black and white cinematography fits perfectly to the story and several scenes in the movie will stay in your mind for a very long time. Personally I am thankful that I got to read the novel when I was still a teenager in school - it's an educational experience one shouldn't miss. Yet I only discovered the movie version decades later, and it didn't disappoint and I learned to love the material even more.

Especially the bonus features in this special edition are enlightening and make the experience whole. They include:

- A Feature Commentary with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula. A highly informative and yet entertaining commentary that stands high above comparable features.
- Making of Documentary: Fearful Symmetry (90 min.) - Provides a lot of background information, not only how the movie was made but also what it meant back then and still means today. The film also sheds light on the time and locations the characters of the movie lived in by via first hand accounts of folk who experienced it all themselves.
- A Conversation with Gregory Peck (97 min.) - A superb and touching documentary about Gregory Peck's life as an actor and father, especially dealing with the influence Harper Lee and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" had on it. Be assured, there's much more than just a few anecdotes to tell, and if you already like the actor, you will find this film heartwarming and love him afterwards. A must see and indispensable supplement to the movie. In this documentary Peck's achievements as an actor and his role as a father in real life stand side by side, the morality of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" resonating all the way through.
- Academy Award Best Actor Acceptance Speech (1:30 min.)
- American Film Institute Life Achievement Award (10 min.)
- Excerpt from Academy Tribute to Gregory Peck (10 min.)
- Scout Remembers (12 min.) - Mary Badham, back then child actress and one of the main characters in the movie, talks about how she became part of the movie and learned to appreciate Gregory Peck.
- And finally: Production Notes, Details on Cast & Film makers and a Theatrical Trailer

In short: A brilliant movie, which made it on a DVD edition chock-full with extras leaving nothing to be desired. If you like classic movies and always wanted to know more about their background, this is the one to get for your collection. 5/5 - one of the best movies of the past century.",1277683200,3,4031,4.713475177304964

52541,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird, as other reviewers have noted, is probably not only one of the significant novels of our time, but also one of the most important movies. It is easy to see why this film resonates with the vast majority who see it, and why it consistently gets mentioned with being one of the 100 best films of all time. It is a rarity to have a film live up to a book, not only in its adaptation, but also how we visualize the story taking place. Producer (Alan J. Pakula) and director (Robert Mulligan) put together a perfect version of Harper Lee's novel, from the mood, music score, cinematography, and cast, who all personify the characters in the book. Gregory Peck was a perfect fit for Atticus Finch, as his taciturn manner, his stoic mood, and his unflinching attitude towards his principles is depicted with such precision. The young children cast as Scout and Jem also give fine performances.

The film itself explores the theme of racial injustice and conflict in the South, but also the essence of believing and doing something because it is the right thing to do, and sticking with it until the end. In this case, Atticus Finch is the lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson, a black man charged with rape, knowing full well that it isn't the popular decision in the Maycomb community, and that ultimately, he and his children will have to pay for it through insults, gossip and general Southern ""inhospitality"". Still, Atticus sticks to his guns, and doesn't let this get the best of him, a lesson that Jem and Scout learn as the film progresses. Gossiping neighbors whisper, not approving of what Atticus is doing. Atticus Finch has several conflicts with Bob Ewell, a trashy member of the community whose prejudice is evidenced when he spits on Atticus, calls him a derogatory term, and then seeks revenge later. As a result of Atticus' strong principles, Jem, his son, and Scout, his daughter, see the world through realistic viewpoints (albeit the ugliness of society's views on race becomes apparent). The children endure taunts from classmates and even relatives about their father defending Tom Robinson and, as the trail unfolds, the ugliness of class and racial injustice surfaces. Jem and Scout experience a coming of age; their innocent world view is contradicted by these unsettling events. The subplot of To Kill a Mockingbird concerns Boo Radley, a recluse who lives nearby, but has not been seen in years. Rumors swirl about Boo, usually involving something to do with his apparent ""craziness"", but there is no real proof, and Jem and Scout are left to their own imaginings. However, a significant event changes their perception of him and the world; they are able, as Atticus puts, see things from another person's perspective.

This DVD is a wonderful tool also for any teacher who teaches the novel in high school, as the film is faithful to the book, including many essential scenes, so it is easy to read parts of the novel and then follow these with the film.

52543,5,0783225857,"This past winter (2010), after losing a job and having very little money, I was driven to watch my VHS of To Kill a Mockingbird over and over again.  Yesterday (5/5/10) I finished the novel, and I wrote a separate review of that.  Here in this review of the film, I want to concentrate on two things: the images of fathers, and the music.

As I kept viewing the film, I noticed that except for Atticus Finch, practically every father in the film is either absent or abusive.  Boo Radley's father cuts him off from the world; Bob Ewell gets drunk and beats his child, and doesn't stop there; Dill Harris' father has apparently abandoned him: after saying he ""hasn't got a father"" but he's ""not dead"", Dill then says his dad let him drive a railroad and one day will swoop him away on an airplane.  Even Tom Robinson, a hard-working Black man with a wife and children, is forced to abandon his family.  Probably Walter Cunningham Sr. does is best, but he is dirt-poor, and can't rise above the prejudices of his society without help.

In contrast, Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), is kind, patient, analytical, discreet, approachable, humble, and courageous, providing an excellent example for his children.  Because he's not a macho man--he refuses to play football for the Methodists because he's too old--his children at first don't think he's much to be proud of, but boy do they learn!

The other thing I want to mention is the music, written by Elmer Bernstein (no relation to Leonard Bernstein, though they were friends).  The main theme, played on flute, violins, then piano, is a haunting melody which probably speaks to the innocence of childhood and nostalgia for that innocence.  The theme plays over and over again in my mind, speaking things to the emotions that words just cannot say.  Elmer Bernstein won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and was nominated for an Oscar.

This film has a great story, great characters, great performances, and a great mood.  See it (again)!",1273104000,2,2002,4.7485549132947975

I've read the book and seen the movie, many times; experiencing both are extremely rewarding.  In particular, the film works marvelously, for several reasons.

For openers, Horton Foote penned a riveting screenplay, while director Robert Mulligan brings Lee's novel to vivid life.  The film is blessed with very believable child actors in Mary Badham (Scout) and Phillip Alford (Jem), who both made their silver screen debuts.  The supporting cast is spectacular, including a grisly, disheveled James Anderson playing villain Bob Ewell and a very young Robert Duvall playing reclusive Boo Radley.  Add to that Peck's commanding performance as a widowed lawyer and father of two children in the Jim Crow South during the Great Depression, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a movie for the ages.  Highly recommended for all movie collectors and cinema buffs.

52549,4,0783225857,"1962's To Kill A Mockingbird spreads its wings to great lengths with seamless effort in underlining the trials and tribulations of a society suffering from social prejudices. Its narrator, the overall-wearing, lovable tomboy Scout Finch (Mary Badham), describes the challenges she and her family face when her father decides to defend a black man charged with a serious crime.  Through her eyes, you see the clear divide that begins to grow in Maycomb County.

Originally adapted from the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, director Robert Mulligan reveals his vision of the classic when the picture opens with a monologue from a seemingly grown-up Scout.  The introduction presents us with information on the somewhat artificial and judgmental Maycomb.  The frame is focused on an all-American, southern neighborhood where citizens open their homes to all, except for the Radleys.  Mystery constantly surrounds their dilapidated home as gossip and tall tales run high in the town; it does not help that the youngest of the family, Boo (Robert Duvall), constantly hides from the outside world in the security of his rundown haven.

In the movie's beginnings, we are introduced to Scout, Jem, and Atticus Finch, a prominent family in the southern town.  Played by Gregory Peck, Atticus serves as the county's best defense lawyer.  Peck brilliantly portrays the classy, respectable single parent described in the Harper Lee original.  Atticus is a character that demands respect both on paper and on screen, and the multi-talented Peck delivers this attitude.  His calm demeanor and noble ways add to the character development in the film.

Controversy surrounds the family when Atticus chooses to take the case of and defend Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), who Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox Paxton) claims assaulted her.  The tension between the word of a black person versus the word of a white person is depicted perfectly by Mulligan when the controversial case goes to court.  The small courthouse not equipped for many people is suddenly packed with eager onlookers.  When the case begins, Atticus asks Tom Robinson subtle, honest questions and receives truthful answers in return.  When Mayella takes the stand, however, her over dramatic shrieks and tearful sobs take away from the validity of her testimony as well as that of her emotions.  Nonetheless, it is well known throughout the movie that the jury still favors Mayella because of the color of her skin.  The verdict of the case has nothing to do with the facts being brought up by the prosecution and defense; the verdict is solely based on social injustices.

Furthermore, under the black and white color pictures lie common events within a family that make the movie relatable to all; Atticus tries avidly to do the right thing, Jem strives to make his father proud, and most evidently, Scout endures the difficult process of becoming and understanding what it means to be a lady.  Not everything is as perfect and plain as it seems though.  The movie packs its share of tragedies; however, it remains inspirationally uplifting in the simplicity of its message.  Atticus's plans for the trial come to an unexpected halt, but his positive, sensible mind helps him come to terms with the outcomes of the whole debacle.

All of the characters come to a climactic clash at the end of the film when Boo Radley makes an unanticipated appearance, Mayella's father Bob goes after the Finch children, and Jem breaks his arm.  The sensation from the film's conclusion fills audiences everywhere with content and motivates them to be as noble as Atticus Finch in their daily lives.  In this intense yet satisfying ending, we see the invariable nature of humans to disagree, but the positive consequences for those who rise above.",1265241600,3,3790,5.08562197092084

This little girl seems to be a tomboy. The kids are warned about the local maniac chained in his house. There is an old lady who is cranky. We hear the family history. People don't dress for the hot weather. The Judge asks Atticus Finch to represent a defendant. These kids just wander around (to present a view of life). Does anyone watch them? That lady does not wear a hat and gloves. ""Scout"" seems to have a behavior problem. Atticus tells about his first gun. He tells ""Scout"" about the need for proper deportment in school.

Then a mad dog appears in the street. Atticus returns to shoot it, he is known as a good shot. Later he meets the wife of the defendant. A man shows up for a scary scene. Jem finds a trinket. ""Scout"" has more behavior problems. Atticus explains his legal work. A man patches a hole in a tree. Jem found things in that hole. At night some cars arrive at the jail. Atticus bars the door, he defends it with moral strength. His daughter's presence turns the men back. [Believable?] The courtroom is packed solid, but there is room on the second floor. The trial begins with testimony from Sheriff Tait. Mr. Ewell tells what he saw. Lawyer Finch shows Ewell is left-handed. May Ellen testifies about what happened. Finch questions her.

Defendant Robinson tells how his left arm was lamed due to an accident on the job when he was twelve years old. [No child labor laws?] May Ellen repeats her claim. [You can judge her credibility.] Mr Robinson takes the stand and tells what happened. Will he be believed? He felt sorry for her? Lawyer Finch said there was no physical evidence for the crime. The defendant has a lame left arm. Was this crime due to the violation of society's rules. Can the word of a Negro be taken against two white people? Finch asks for justice for his client. The jury takes two hours to decide on guilty. Later Finch learns that Robinson was shot while trying to escape.

Jem and Tina May walk home in the dark for a final dramatic scene. They are attacked by a strange man. Jem is hurt. Mr. Ewell is found dead. Who rescued Jem? [Is the ending believable?] Sheriff Tait decides that Ewell fell on his knife. This case is closed. An example of poetic justice?

It treats with gentle irony and profound moral insight the legal, social and spiritual issues of cruel poverty and heroic moral courage when that poverty, together with stupidity and moral cowardice call for taking the right course even when there is no possibility of victory.

Not purposely, but simply because life got in the way--raising a family, working two jobs, dealing with setbacks and disappointment, trying always to rise above the roadblocks, to make it all worthwhile, and even have some fun, along the way. There were years when my passion for reading took a back seat to being a wife, a mom, a part of the work force that keeps society moving, money in the bank account. Reading never stopped, but time became a luxury I often had to steal for an occasional book. Today, when I might have three books going at once, plus all the internet information I can devour, bliss is mine. Now, as I read To Kill a Mockingbird, I'm beyond sad that this feast was denied me so long. Given the current, woeful state of the world, of national politics, reading this book has provided me a deeper well of comprehension of racial realities of which I was aware, certainly, which offended me, throughout my life.

Lone fathers and their kids have been a hit in many movies. I have severl examples, like, Ryan and Tatum O'Neil in Paper Moon, Jon Voight and Ricky Schroeder in the re-make of 'The Champ' and Dustin Hoffman and Justin Henry in Kramer vs Kramer. Gregory Peck, won an Academy Award, for playing a sole parent, and he's never been better. The script for this movie was based upon Harper Lee's sensitive and intelligent novel set in racially-torn Alabama. Gregory Peck, plays Atticus Finch, a wise lawyer bravely raising his two kids Jem(Phillip Alford) and Scout(Mary Badham) in the hot-headed Southern town. The crux of the plot is Finch's defence of a colored man accused of rape. The film was put together by two excellent film-makers, producer Alan J.

52579,5,0783225857,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a powerful, hugely well-acted film that should be on everyone's Top Ten and should be in every film collection. The book took me for a ride as a child, one of those rare books we were made to read in school that I could not put down; the film, with exemplary performances by Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Brock Peters, is a searing treatise on social mores of the time and it still speaks to us today. We have not come all that far from the era portrayed in the film, and it should be shown in schools; it is that good.

Scout (Mary Badham), a precocious child, runs pretty much unchecked through the small Southern town in which she is raised, tolerated by the townsfolk because her father is Atticus Finch, a well-respected attorney; and really, she is looked upon with affection by most, who feel sorry for her because her mother died. She only has time to ruminate on that occasionally, as she and her older brother Jem, and a visiting boy there for the summer, get into all sorts of adventures against the backdrop of her father's preparing to defend a local black man on trial for the alleged rape of a young white woman. There are those in town who can smell a frame clearly enough, but this is the South, and a charge brought by a white against a black is going to have dismally predictable results. Atticus, who knows his client is innocent, forges ahead anyway, facing down intimidation and threats to his children, and building up the film to a crescendo of an ending. The ending of the movie - and scattered references throughout the film - introduced us, also, to Robert Duvall, as he just began his film career; and though his part is small, it is wrenchingly powerful.

The highest recommendation possible. Everyone should own this movie, in whatever form you can get it.",1219795200,,1813,4.524390243902439

52586,5,0783225857,"Without much knowledge of history behind the acclaimed author Truman Capote, I watched the film ""Capote"" sometime back, and was interested in knowing more about his childhood friend Harper Lee and the her Pulitzer prize willing novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" mentioned in the film. After reading the reviews, I realized that this novel is tagged as the book of the century in American literature by the critics and the fans. I bought the film with high expectations, and all my expectations were exceeded by this masterpiece. This movie and the history behind Harper Lees work touched me so deep, that I went to imdb ([...]) and gave it a perfect 10 rating. This is the only movie I have rated 10 so far, although I have given 9 to about dozen of movies. ([...])

Being an alien to American way of life and its discourse, I think I have uncovered one of the gems in modern American literature. Reasons, that I was drawn so much to this movie could be personal to me as well. The little girl who plays the lead role reminds me of my own little daughter, and the Atticus Finch's character in this movie, could be the role model of fatherhood for any given culture.",1212796800,3,1161,4.5285714285714285
52587,4,0783225857,"Having read the book twice and now watching the film, it's nice to see that the film has actually done justice to the book in that it's successful in bringing out the actual message of innocence lost and about the difference between right and wrong, good and evil as seen from the point of view of 3 children and specifically the little girl Scout.  People tend to hate and seek to destroy that which they don't understand just because it scares them and the children learn at the end that the best way to overcome this fear is to face it head on and to seek to learn and understand rather than to judge and destroy.  At the end, this is what Scout does as she befriends the feared Boo who saves her brother's life.  We all naturally love to support the underdog and this film tells the story of Atticus fighting for justice and teaching his kids as he does so by his actions as well as his words.

This dvd has an excellent documentary about the film as well as good interviews with the cast and crew as they look back at their experiences while making the film.  The picture quality is okay but not perfect and could do with another restoration job although the 2-channel mono sound quality is okay but a 5.1 surround option would have been much appreciated.  Overall, this is a well-crafted film with excellent acting and an excellent screenplay.

52588,5,0783225857,"This film is an excellent black and white adaptation of Harper Lee's book of the same name. The acting, particularly by Gregory Peck (and a cameo by a young Robert Duval), brings out all the pathos, bathos and grit of small town Southern life in the 1930's. The story itself is an unusual combination, narrated by Peck's film daughter (and presumably Lee herself), of a stage of the coming of age story that we are fairly familiar with and the question of race and sex in the Deep South (and not only there) with which we were (at the time of the film's debut in 1962) only vaguely familiar. That dramatic tension, muted as it was by the cinematic and social conventions of the time, nevertheless made a strong statement about the underlying tensions of this society at a time when the Southern black civil rights struggle movement was coming in focus in the national consciousness.

The name Atticus Finch (Peck's role) as the liberal (for that southern locale) lawyer committed to the rule of law had a certain currency in the 1960's as a symbol for those southern whites who saw that Jim Crow had to go. Here Finch is the appointed lawyer for a black man accused of raping a white women of low origin- the classic `white trash' depicted in many a film and novel. Finch earnestly, no, passionately in his understated manner, attempts to defend this man, a brave act in itself under the circumstances.

Needless to say an all white jury of that black man's `peers' nevertheless convicts him out of hand. In the end the black man tries to escape and is killed in the process. In an earlier scenario Finch is pressed into guard duty at the jailhouse in order to head off a posse of `white trash' elements who are bend on doing `justice' their way- hanging him from a lynching tree. On a mere false accusation of a white woman this black man is doomed whichever way he turns. Sound familiar?

The other part of the story concerns the reactions by Finch's motherless son and tomboyish daughter to the realities of social life, Southern style. That part is in some ways, particularly when the children watch the trial from the ""Negro"" balcony section of the courtroom, the least successful of the film. What is entirely believable and gives some relief from the travesty that is unfolding are the pranks, pitfalls and antics of the kids. The tensions between brother and sister, the protective role of the older brother, the attempt by the sister to assert her own identity, the sense of adventure and mystery of what lies beyond the immediate household that is the hallmark of youth all get a work out here. But in the end it is the quiet dignity of solid old Atticus and the bewildered dignity of a doomed black man that hold this whole thing together. Bravo Peck. Kudos to Harper Lee.",1211846400,,2783,4.606854838709677

The film is a classic starring Oscar Winner, Gregory Peck, in the character that became his signature role. The supporting cast is equally stellar with the children, Jem and Scout. We hear about how the children on the set were invited to the Peck home to spend the weekends. The cast included Ruth White as Mrs. Dubose which her part was cut short in the film than in the book. I have collected a lot of Ruth White memorabilia. She spent four hours in make-up each day. Alice Ghostley plays a neighbor and mother. Mary Badham who played Scout never really became a household name but she does not regret doing the film one bit. Scout is immortalized by her performance as a tough but sensitive young girl.

52597,5,0783225857,"I remember several years back watching one of those AFI ""Top 100"" shows, this time relating to the top 100 heroes and villains in film history.  It was easy to predict that Hannibal Lecter would be the top villain.  But as the countdown progressed, I wondered who would be the top hero.  My personal film hero has always been Atticus Finch, but as the Superman and Indiana Jones characters were being named in the final few slots, I didn't think the AFI voters would agree with me.  I was genuinely surprised, and very, very pleased, that the top film hero named was, indeed, Atticus Finch.

I then started to think why it was I considered this character a hero, because certainly in Atticus Finch's mind, he wasn't doing ""heroic"" things.  He defended Tom Robinson not to be looked upon as saintly or holier than thou, but because he wanted to set a good example for his children -- and, very simply, he thought it was the right thing to do.  I think Atticus Finch's quiet devotion to his children, and his belief in doing what was decent and right in his life and profession, made this character a hero in my eyes.  As an attorney, I think often of Gregory Peck's summation in the film when I'm preparing for a trial.  I always find it inspiring.

This is a film I revisit at least once a year, and it never ceases to move and inspire me.  Harper Lee must have been so proud.",1201478400,6,1376,4.399209486166008

52601,5,0783225857,"This is a turly classic film that has been universally recognized as one of the greatest films of all time. It is told from the eyes of a young girl named ""Scout"", the 6 year old daughter of a county lawyer, Atticus Finch.  Mary Badham marvelously plays ""Scout"", a Tom-boy, who with her brother ""Jem"", and friend ""Dill"" witness the events that swept them into the eye of the hurricane of racial hatred.  While the three children are consumed by the rumors about their mysterious neighbor, ""Boo"" Radley, Scout's father, Atticus Finch, prepares to defend the black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white girl.  Gregory Peck is absolutley fabulous as Atticus Finch.  Peck nails the character of Atticus the lawyer who defends the wrongfully accused black man of raping a white woman in the deep racial South in 1935. The outcome of the trial was a given, guilty; yet, Atticus courageously stands up to the prejudicial all-white jury and angrilly demands them to find the courage to stand up for the truth and set free an innocent man.  Yet, the social rules of the time demanded a guilty verdict and it was brought.  Robinson despairs and breaks away during a transfer and is shot and killed.  All seems lost, and Atticus and his children despair.  But the end is not yet. Bob Euell, the father of the girl who claimed rape has a hatred of Atticus that cannot be quenched even by the death of Robinson.  He blindly hates Atticus for daring to take the opinion of a black man over a white man.  Since he does not have the courage to face Atticus, he instead goes after Scout and Jem.  Suddenly and unexpectedly, the children are rescued by their mysterious reclusive neighbor Arthur ""Boo"" Radley, who was the children's protector, despite his mental retardation.

The movie ends in a touching scene where Scout slowly walks Boo back to his house holding his pale hand in hers.  She then returns to the secure and comforting lap of her father Atticus, who is dutifully watching over injured Jem.  In the background is a picture of Atticus' deceased wife on the mantle, (the first view we have of her).  The love of this father for his children is clearly evident in his tenderness and decency.

Oh how this world could so richly benefit from more honorable and courageous men like Atticus Finch.

Buy this movie and watch it once a year with your children.  As your children age, they will see the deeper social message which is the heart of the movie.

Until that time, we can do no better than to sit down and read the book and then watch this perfect movie adaptation.

There are other great books and movies that cover the depression years in America. ""Grapes of Wrath"" comes to mind. Harper Lee's book and this film focus not on the displaced as much as how one person can rise to the occasion, show a strong moral spine and true courage. It would have been too simple to say that the film was about prejudice. Coming to the screen as it did during the rising cauldron of the Civil Rights movement, this film was a perfect mirror for the haunting specter that refused to shed its shadow over the south. In the aftermath of the ruinous Civil War, southern states, especially the Carolina's which led the revolt, suffered very badly during and after the war. In some places poverty and destitution never left the land. What did people do to get by in the depression era? Did they fall back on old ways and use scapegoats to satisfy the blame game? Certainly and that is where the story here begins.

The audience watching this film in 1962 was familiar with prejudice but rarely had it seen a white man treat an African American with respect and a resolute commitment to seeking justice. There are other sinister themes that rise to the surface. The implication of a daughter being beaten by a drunken father, the taboo of a white woman seducing a black man, the injustice done to a mentally handicapped man by shuttering him like a prisoner in his own home; these are all hot buttons that would have made an audience squirm and disquiet their comfort zones. Even more ugly was the false accusation of an honest man, a person that was expected to be found guilty even by his own peers simply because he was a visible minority; this was the deep south and prejudice was so widespread.

The richness of the story gives depth and detail to the lives of Atticus Finch and his fiercely independent children as they explore their lives. With several subplots swirling around the main trial, the audience is given constant stimulation in vivid colors of human drama. Shot in black and white and blessed with a superb script, one of the greatest male actors in the English speaking world, a sublime musical score by Elmer Bernstein, two child actors who were so natural that they became Atticus's children in a real way.....this film is iconic in American cinema and for so many good reasons.

52620,5,0783225857,"I've been intrigued by the idea of `To Kill a Mockingbird' for some time now.  Knowing that it is rendered one of the finest cinematic accomplishments of all time had perked my interest early on but it became the movie I wanted to see but never got around to.  It's hard to find this little treasure in any rental place, but recently our library received a copy and so I snatched it up the second it was available.  Now I must say that I have not read the novel yet.  It's on my VERY LONG LIST of `must reads' but I just have yet to reach it.  After watching this film though I may have to reach that book a little quicker than anticipated.

I guess the first thing I should say is that everything you've heard about this film is true, all the praise it received was well deserved and every second of it's running time is well worth it.  I was absorbed in this film from start to finish.

`To Kill a Mockingbird' broaches the subject of racism in the South during the depression but it's overlaying message of equality and acceptance are what we should all be taking away from this masterpiece.  The film revolves around a count case involving a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is the man selected to represent him.  The story is told through the eyes of Atticus' children, mostly his daughter Scout.  As Scout and her brother Jem battle their own quote-unquote prejudices with a neighborhood boy named Boo Radley they watch their father work to free a man he knows is innocent.  Atticus, a widower, works equally hard to instill good morals in his two children and raise them right and this is reflected in their ability to reason on situations, some even too big for them to fully understand.

`To Kill a Mockingbird' has been labeled a classic, and you don't call them classics for nothing.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' truly is a downright perfect film.  The acting is superb, which is something I never truly expected.  I have watched a fair share of older films and have always found that the acting never truly stacks up to the great actors of today, but the performances by Gregory Peck especially rival those of today.  Gregory Peck (who won the Oscar for this performance) comes across so natural, so organic here.  He reacts as a father would, with subtleties when necessary as well as force.  His performance is understandably tempered and it helps aid the message of the film along.

The two young children as well, Mary Badham and Philip Alford, are excellent here.  For young actors they grasped their characters exceptionally well.  Brock Peters is convincing as Tom Robinson, the black man on trial, and James Anderson is deliciously evil as Robert Ewell, the man accusing him of the crime (against his daughter).

It was also interesting to see a young Robert Duvall here in a very small yet very powerful role.  He was truly commanding and played a key part in making this film's message a universal one.

In the end I don't think there are enough good things to be said about `To Kill a Mockingbird'.  It's brilliantly scripted, acted and directed and stands the test of time, for while it was released in 1962 it still means something today, 45 years later.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' is a film that everyone should see in order to appreciate and one that I highly recommend to anyone with the slightest interest.

52634,4,0783225857,"It says a lot that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was made in 1962, at a time when Hollywood was finally able to address the civil rights issue and congratulate itself on its courage for doing so, while not actually presenting material that would be truly challenging to American audiences.  If a film like this had been made even ten years earlier, it would have constituted an act of true artistic courage.  Made in 1962, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a work of great artistry, but there is nothing overwhelmingly courageous about it.

Critical response to the film version of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" seems to fall into two categories.  The majority of reviewers have praised the film's beauty and simplicity, its wonderfully natural and understated performances, and its loving evocation of a long-gone place and time.  A minority of commentators, including Roger Ebert, have criticized the film's lapses of believability and its use of African-American characters as symbols rather than individuals.

I think that both views are clearly correct.  The performances of the entire cast -- in particular, Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Brock Peters -- bring the story to life so naturally that the viewer seems to be watching the lives of real people rather than a movie.  As Mulligan and Pakula point out on their DVD commentary, the entire film is handled with a dignity and restraint that would be unthinkable in later eras of the history of motion pictures.

On the other hand, the film features less meaningful interaction between the black and white characters than one might have hoped -- less, indeed, than takes place in Harper Lee's novel.  Tom Robinson, the African-American character most central to the plot, never comes into direct contact with Scout, the viewpoint character.  She witnesses his tragedy like a spectator at a play, never seeming to grapple with it personally.  When the repercussions of Tom Robinson's story finally threaten Scout and Jem in the film's third act, it is a white character who endangers them and another white character who saves them.

The only African-American character who walks through the movie as a regular person rather than a tragic symbol is Calpurnia, Atticus' household employee, excellently played by Estelle Evans.  In earlier Hollywood eras, few black characters could have interacted with whites so naturally and straightforwardly, or been presented as strong and intelligent individuals in their own right without any trace of comedy.  But even Calpurnia seems to fade out of the story as it proceeds, and we never see her reaction to the fate of Tom Robinson.

""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a treasurable movie, in particular for its depiction of the unusual relationship of mutual respect between Atticus and his children and for Elmer Bernstein's score, featuring one of the loveliest main themes ever to come out of Hollywood.  But it probably does not deserve to be regarded as one of America's greatest films.  Most mockingbirds are gray, but there are two mockingbirds in this movie:  one white and one black.  Only the white mockingbird perches on the heroine's shoulder to sing his song, and that's a bit disappointing.",1189814400,2,3177,5.061420345489443

52637,5,0783225857,"""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was made long before the feminist war on men. Warren Farrell once wrote that we have gone from ""father knows best"" to ""daddies molest"". This movie belongs to the ""father knows best"" category. If the movie had been produced during the Clinton administration, it would have featured Sally Field as a fearless feminist attorney fighting  bigotry in a small southern town while single-handedly raising her two children after their drunken, abusive father had walked out on them. Boo Radley would have been institutionalized before he could get his perverted hands on Scout.
  Fortunately we are spared all that. Instead we have Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, a widowed attorney who raises his children with kindness and compassion, aided by his black housekeeper Calpurnia. Atticus is given the job of defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. He braves the wrath of the town by giving the man an honest and competent defense and tries to get him acquitted. Meanwhile he defends his children by shooting a rabid dog (could Sally Field shoot a rabid dog?) and teaches them not to kill mockingbirds. In the end the unlikely hero of this movie turns out to be the strange and reclusive Boo Radley.

52642,5,0783225857,"Why ban them? Then, we might be spared what is possibly the most infantile, ignorant and uninformed collection of negative reviews present on Amazon.

I originally intended to post a review a few weeks ago after I had viewed it on cable, but for some reason I decided to read the negative views first(both book and movie) to see why or how anyone could condemn either. It became a laugh or cry situation. I opted for forced laughter.

A few examples of the absurd negative comments follow (with my own comments in parenthesis):

""Every copy of this book should be burned and never allowed to be read again."" (Ah, the sweet smell of scorched paper around the bonfires. Armbands optional?)

""Yuk! Try to avoid reading this book as much as possible. . . . [I]t is confusing . . . and there is too much information given at one time."" (You had me at ""Yuk!"")

""Thanks to all my friendswho had to tourchure threw reading this disgrace and supporting me in not likeing the book. By the way, DO NOT BUY, because if i find it in your house i won't think to kindly of you."" (I tremble in terror and weep in shame at what you would think of my bookshelves.)

""Talk about a bad movie i would only buy it if someone paid me twice it's value to."" (I don't think this is what was meant by the ""new math."")

And, my favorite: ""Do not watch, do not read ... stay ignorant of Harper Lee."" (I suspect, young reader, that you have succeeded far beyond Harper Lee.)

Sorry to review the reviews, but now I actually have something serious to say about the movie and book.

Years before the publication of Harper Lee's novel, there was a trial in a small southern Mississippi town in 1945. A black man named Willie McGee was accused of the rape of a white woman. The circumstantial evidence pointed strongly to the possibility that the relationship was forced by the woman. Just as in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" such a relationship at the time could not - would not - be tolerated. The case attracted national attention at the time, and after a prolonged series of appeals (spearheaded by former New York Congresswoman, Bella Abzug), a public execution was staged, which was no more than a legally sanctioned lynching. The state's portable electric chair was installed in the courthouse, which was filled to standing room only. Outside spectators climbed trees to gain a look at the execution through the opened windows. (A white Mississippi attorney, Dixon Pyles, also took part in the defense, so Atticus Finch is not without a foundation in fact.)

The Scottsboro trials have been cited as the main inspiration for Lee's novel, but I've often wondered if the McGee trial might not also have played a role. But it really doesn't matter. Fiction is often more suited to tell the truth than history. And the truth is that although many people in the South knew Jim Crow laws and lynchings were wrong, they also knew that if you were vocal about it, you could lose your job - or your life, which is what makes the portrait of Atticus Finch a true profile in courage, a Southern Gothic version of Sir Thomas Moore in ""A Man For All Seasons.""

But beyond the racial themes, both the book and the movie weave a gentle tapestry of what life in the South was like before air-conditioning, where games were things to be played outdoors rather than in front of computers, a discarded tire was an endlessly renewable resource for entertainment and summers seemed to last forever.  (I've lived what I'm talking about.)

What saddens me about the negative reviews such as I quoted above is not their ignorance, but the lack of curiosity they display about our nation's history. I do, however, hope that the young reviewer who urged the burning of all copies of the book is oblivious of the historical events he or she evoked and will someday realize the horror of what such comments endorse.

One can write that this has to be one of Gregory Peck's greatest performances portraying the memorable Atticus Finch with such believability that Peck attempted time and again to shed ""Atticus"" as an actor, even as an established one for twenty years, asking for ""villain"" roles and being turned down until&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boys-From-Brazil/dp/0784012717/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boys From Brazil</a>, Atticus Finch was a role made for Gregory Peck as the actor can play the sensitive, caring man of integrity with utter ease and did so for several films following To Kill a Mockingbird, such as ""Behold a Pale Horse"" (1964) ""Mirage"" (1965) and ""Arabesque"" (1966).

Harper Lee's novel addresses many issues for its time including racism and entrenched prejudice against the black American in the deep south before and during The Great Depression and after...as an audience of the film, we are exposed to the necessity of pursuing virtue as human beings and what it really means and how important it is to have basic good manners in one's life; what it means to reach for and practice goodness and have core beliefs and in the end, standing firm by those beliefs against overwhelming opposition. The film also shows us the need to walk a mile in another person's shoes before making any judgements on them, or as Atticus says to Scout... ""Until you step inside their skin and walk around a little...""

Despite this film opening forty years ago, the story and performances continue to be a model for present day filmmaking...beginning with a great story, a well adapted screenplay, a director who loves the project thus all in the crew give 100%, and the same basic example of virtue and integrity communicated in the novel and adapted for the screen: compassion, kindness, courage, respect and love.

Since then I have read the book a few more times and seen the movie probably another 50 times. In recent years many of the movie collections are combined with interviews with the original cast.

Many will remember that when Brock Peters delivered the eulogy at Peck's funeral that he remembered Peck as a man who lived his life every day as Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck has always been one of my very favorite actors so this had great meaning for me to know that someone actually lead a principled life away from the stage.

The characters in the book are all very realistic for any community, not just a southern community. Racism and prejudice made be bolder and more pronounced in the south but it can be found anywhere.

Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance. Set in the Deep South of Lee's childhood in the fictional town of Maycomb in 1932, the story, adapted by writer Horton Foote, focuses on six-year old Scout, the tomboy, motherless daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch.

Along with her four-years older brother Jem, Scout regales the new neighbor boy Dill with horror stories about the bleak-looking Radley house and its chief occupant, ""Boo"", whom they believe has been locked up in the basement. Finch, in the meantime, has been given the unenviable task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella, the cry-wolf daughter of a white trash racist farmer, Bob Ewell. The two stories meld seamlessly with the model behavior of Finch, who tries to teach his children not to come to judgment based on hearsay and perception. Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing. Because of the town's pervasive racism, Finch loses the case, and tragic consequences ensue. However, life lessons for the children emerge as well as ""Boo"" in an unexpected heroic act.

Gregory Peck gives his career-best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human-sized dimensions to a most honorable man. It's inspiring work from a great screen legend. Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem. Brock Peters plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as ""Boo"" Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voiceover for the grown-up Scout ne Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get.

The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J. Pakula, a superb director in his own right. There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom-seen Badham, and the original theatrical trailer.

The second disc offers a fascinating, ninety-minute 1998 documentary, ""Fearful Symmetry"", filmed effectively in black-and-white, which goes well beyond the standard making-of featurette. It includes interviews with Peck, Badham, Alford, Pakula, Mulligan, Foote and Bernstein, and paints a remarkably penetrating story of the production. There is a second feature, 1999's ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"", directed by famed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, which is actually a full-blown feature about the actor as he prepares for an onstage tribute. Providing revealing glimpses of the private man, it originally aired on PBS's ""American Masters"" series.",1158451200,13,3859,5.352553542009884

In addition to the classic movie (which we never tire of), the special features are very interesting, including interviews with ""Scout"" (Mary Badham), and ""Atticus Finch"".  It is easy to understand why Gregory Peck is so revered and respected as an actor.

52701,4,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird is certainly destined to be a classic of both American literature and American film-making, if it is not already. I would like to first discuss the novel from which the film was adapted. Then I will discuss the award winning film which can be obtained on DVD. Finally I will discuss the continued question about this work, which is whether it is a book for children or adults.

Harper Lee's novel continues to stimulate debate. Whereas the debate was about morality and racial relationships when the novel was written, the debate of late is centered on whether Harper Lee wrote a book for adults written through the eyes of a child or whether her intention was to write a book for children/young adults. I know I read the book when I was in the eighth grade and found it to be wonderful. But maybe it was fantastic because I was 14 years old and the moral clarity and wise heroism of Atticus Finch seems very right to my adolescent sense of justice. The re-claiming of Bo Radley back into the world of the living also gives a message about rejection, acceptance, reclaiming the lost, and affection. The novel is full of wonderful experience and moral commentary as presented through the eyes of a 7 year old tom-boy, a technique Mark Twain used in many of his novels. Twain recommended this style in fact pointing out that the hypocracy and odd motives of adults can be commented upon through nieve eyes with a sense of wonder and delightful humor.

The film, which captures poor rural Alabama perfectly, also was fantastic. Gegory Peck was outstanding, as were all the actors. The screen play is penetrating and tight, never letting the characters become cute country hicks. The black and white format with austere depression era sets compliments the actions, turning a residential street in a poor Alabama town into a microcosm of the world of good, bad, and misunderstood forces.

But is it for children or adults?  Flannery O'Connor, the great writer, said that it amazed her that most adult readers didn't realize it was a children's book. This debate is re-introduced in the recent film ""Capote"" where a New York literary character asks Nelle Harper Lee at a cocktail party about the 'children's book' she had written and published. After a recent reviewing of the book and film, I find that the work actually has vast appeal to children, young adults, and adults. I don't mean this to be avoidance of answering the question, but the work has multiple levels of depth and moral instruction relevant to any age. The criticism that it is a children's book is usually based on the lack of moral ambiguity in the strong forceful wise character of Atticus Finch. However, he is surrounded by adults with quivering morality, including the county sherrif and a town full of persuadable white establishment. It may in fact be very realistic to portray a character with clear moral bearings such as Atticus Finch, since such persons do in fact live in reality and I have been lucky enough in my life to know many such fine persons and I personally aspire to such moral character and strength. I don't think this makes me childlike for I recognize character is long in developing,often tested, and always remains an unfinished work of art within us.  This is the appeal of the adult reader/viewer for this classic work of American literature and film-making for in the end it calls upon all of us, child or adult, to aspire to our own strength of character and courage for the sake of justice.",1156809600,4,3511,4.730392156862745

52715,5,0783225857,"Harper Lee's book To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic piece of literature read by students everywhere. However, I was not one of those students. It was not on my reading list, much to my regret now. I just finished reading the book and enjoyed it thoroughly. I love Scout's charming point of view and her descriptions of childhood summers make me wish for times past. Justice, or lack of it, is made so real when looked at from the perspective of Scout and her brother Jem. And the dynamic between the kids and the mysterious Boo Radley is just plain cool in the book.

The movie is great too. A classic. The way some of the scenes are portrayed is dead on. I also love how Scout's narration in the book is carried into the movie. It's great to hear Harper Lee's narrative spoken. The charm of Scout's childhood is effectively portrayed visually in the film. I do like the book better for the simple reason that it portrays so much more than the movie ever could. The ""relationship"" between the kids and Boo Radley is included in the movie but more fully developed in the book. Because the movie just can't handle it fully, it ends up as a sidestory to the trial instead of a developed storyline all its own as in the book. The movie also couldn't include some of the additional charm of the book - like the storyline with Mrs. Dubose; how the kids feel about Atticus and the Finch family; visiting Calpurnia's church; or how Aunt Alexandra, surprisingly enough, began to have an effect on the lady Scout would become.

Don't get me wrong though, I really did enjoy the movie. The character portrayals were great - especially Scout and Atticus.  But I must say (at the risk of sounding like the girl that I am) that the best part about the movie to me was that it brought the book to life so effectively that in parts I was somewhat emotional. It is a powerful story of childhood and race and justice (or injustice) that cannot be ignored. It speaks to so many in book or film form. Awesome! Enjoy both!",1154995200,3,2002,4.420054200542006

52717,5,0783225857,"What is up with the digital touch up of Gregory Peck's face! The DVD cover of this Legacy edition makes him look much younger than he truly is in the picture. *Sigh* I guess that's Hollywood for ya!

""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a beloved classic, and also one of my favorite films of all-time.

Robert Mulligan directs this film. His style of film-making is one I've come to appreciate and love! He creates character-driven films that are much more heartfelt and personal, plus so much more enjoyable and satisfying to watch. Most would agree that well-developed characters are the essence of great films--same goes for stories, too!

Harper Lee's classic novel was a huge success, mainly because of the unforgettable characters. My personal favorite was Atticus Finch (portrayed brilliantly by Peck). He was a brave man who didn't have to use his fist or a gun to get his message across. He embodied goodness, justice, virtue, integrity, courage--all relative qualities that I associate with honorable men. Scout and Jem were fortunate to have him as a father--and as a role model, too!

This Legacy edition is definitive for all DVD collections. As for the film itself, it's timeless. It will no doubt be cherished and enjoyed by generation of moviegoers to come. OUTSTANDING five stars!

NOTE: Mulligan's last film, ""The Man in the Moon,"" is another favorite of mine--a rehash of the nostalgic, ""Summer of '42."" It's a gem and one that I highly recommend!",1153612800,3,1457,4.90650406504065

It is one of the rare instances where the movie is almost as good as the book, written by Harper Lee.

This is the Legacy Series edition of this movie and contains additional features for ardent fans of this incredible work. Contained here, along with the movie on disc one, are Gregory Peck's Academy Award acceptance speech for best actor, his remarks from the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, an excerpt from the Academy's tribute to Gregory Peck, an interview with Mary Badham (Scout), feature commentary from the Director and Producer and the theatrical trailer.

Disc two includes a well produced documentary titled ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"" where Peck reminisces his stellar career and interacts with audiences and past co-stars. Here Peck's somewhat controversial social activism is touched on, which may be a turn off to some as he was a staunch and vocal advocate of gun control, withdrawal from Viet Nam and other activist issues of that age. This disc also includes the making of the movie, which is an exceptional feature.

Also included in the Legacy Series edition are eleven matted reproductions of original theatrical posters, which would be suitable for framing for collectors of such memorabilia.

Gregory Peck delivers a great performance as Atticus Finch, the conscientious lawyer who defends a black man against false rape allegations. His children, Jem and Scout, played by Philip Alford and Mary Badham are extremely well-cast and act very naturally. Brock Peters is right-on as the accused negro, with James Anderson doing a phenomenal job as the villian, Bob Ewell.

Although this a story which is probably better fitted for a book than a movie, it does not lose any of its heart on-screen, thanks in part to screenwriter Horton Foote. Although filmed on a holywood set, the rustic ambiance of the old southern town is brought to life very vividly.

The Bonus Features on the DVD include the academy award best-actor acceptance speech by Gregory Peck, as well as an interesting recent interview with Mary Badham.

52731,5,0783225857,"A Reflection Of Our Lives

The following May 2006 review of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is an update to my prior January 2000 review of the same movie. This updated review refers to the superior ""Legacy Series Edition"" of the movie which is now the preferred DVD purchase choice. The ""Legacy Series Edition"" includes notably better sound options (Dolby Digital 5.1) than previous editions (such as the ""Collectors Edition"") as well as various `extras' now included in the ""Legacy"" two disc set. The `5.1 sound option' alone is worth upgrading to the ""Legacy Series Edition"" and many fans will appreciate the new `extras' included on the new version. Now, on to the movie (and the book)...

""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a timeless classic, displayed in breathtaking imaginative and visual beauty whether you read the book or watch the movie. Either genre brings to life the old south, its charm, its bigotry, its prejudice, its fear of the unknown, and ultimately its triumph of the human soul.

There is a beauty to both the movie and the book which seems to change as one grows older. The timelessness of the movie/book is evidenced on two different levels. Both are appreciated today as much as when they were originally released. Perhaps more importantly, children under the age of 10 identify with the book or movie as only a child can. As one grows older, you see the movie/book through the eyes of an adult and from a different perspective. A parent can also appreciate the movie, reliving it through their own children's eyes.

The BOOK is essentially the 'coming of age' of Jem as he slowly leaves his childhood behind and begins to understand the harsh realities of life in the deep South. The MOVIE more represents the 'coming of age' of Scout as she views the black and white realities which slowly surround her. Scout's innocence reminds adults of their moral code and conduct in the movie, the book, and (surprisingly) in real life. She is able to center us on our own humanity as is witnessed in many scenes; chiefly in the (midnight) jail scene where she single handedly (and unknowingly) stops a lynching by simply saying `hello' to someone she recognizes in the lynch mob.

Ultimately, I suppose, the movie represents our 'coming of age', as a child, as an adult, as individuals, and as a society. Each of us must decide whether we will take up the hangman's noose or drop the rope in favor of the child within.

On a different level, Boo Radley represents all of these same fears, prejudices, and bigotry ingrained within America, North and South. Only when we finally meet Boo for the first time, do we recognize a human face, a protector, a neighbor, rather than the devil himself. Scout and Jem's journey is also our journey, one in which we all make. Some choose to see the fearful murderer who lives in the Radley house, while others choose to see the human being and ultimately reach out to say ""Hey Boo...""

In this black and white book, in this black and white movie, in this black and white world, there will always be a Bob or Mayella Ewell. Fortunately, there will also be a Boo, an Atticus, a Tom, a Jem, or a Scout. Hopefully they will be there for each of us when we ""waked up in the morning...""",1147219200,,3221,4.640350877192983

52754,5,0783225857,"The racism `s argument monopolized the whole attention, specially in the Sixties. To be fair, we should take a glimpse around several essential films in the recent past which depicted with notable crudeness this sensible theme; among the most important we should name Defiant ones and The edge of city in the Fifties.

But undoubtedly, the four most important thematic cycles  had reached its task in the movie industry: The Noir Film, The Science Fiction, The War memories and the lightweight comedies (Wilder, Hawks); an important and relatively recent current had born in the world: The French New Wave and the strong transcendence of the Italian Neo Realism permeated the vision of most of screen writers obligating them to make a true inward gaze in the deepest regions of the American social body. If there would be another weight reason to confirm this statement, examine carefully the work of Alfred Hitchcock from ""To catch a thief"" until ""Marnie"". You may realize how every one of the included pictures included these two concern about a dislocated state of mind, and the suspense is generated in the hidden caverns of the unconscious.

In this sense this film had to shock the conscience of many viewers at that moment, when a small town layer assumes the hazardous task to defend a black man accused of rape. The allusive metaphors to nocturnal and spectral visions are eloquent testimonies of the tenseness at the verge of the boiling point.

The bitter taste you experience even several elapsed weeks and months don 't leave any shadow of doubt about the grandness of this bold film that inspired future films in that decade, such as Patch of Blue, To Sir with love, Guess who is coming to dinner, In the heat of the night (it' s not a mere casualty all of them starred by Poitier) and nourished the inspired of another independent filmmakers such as Samuel Fuller with two somber and terrible films (Shock corridor and The naked kiss). Of course, there would be a striking picture as ""The chase"", but this speech would be out of context.

52755,5,0783225857,"To those who judge a book by its cover, Gregory Peck in spectacles looks like too serious a film to dig up - but this film is not about serious old Gregory Peck.  It is quite a simple story from the vantage of two motherless children who play around and are intrigued by an unknown fearful character in their neighbourhood reputed to be mad, and the events surrounding Gregory Peck, their father defending a black worker unjustly accused of raping a woman - during the 1930s when segregation was the norm in the south.

Gregory Peck comes across as a very dignified, handsome, moral character - who abounds in justice and strong paternal qualities.  The true star of the show is Gregory Peck's daughter and her tomboy antics along with her brother and their friend.  Peck's character is a admirable lawyer defending a case which in all probability he will lose.  But the unfairness meted to the black defendant though forming a core aspect to this film is not centre stage.  What is centre stage is the children and their vision of the proceedings and the danger they are placed in from those who hate Peck's advocacy of a black man's justice.

The music and overall atmosphere of the film describing quiet southern town life evokes a bygone age of innocence, friendliness and charm - along with the grosser aspects of intolerance at the time.  The music if very special.

52756,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird rates my highest rating possible on at least three levels.

1. The film and screenplay are superbly adapted from the Harper Lee Novel. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch. The child actors Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are natural and very believable. Robert Duvall almost steals the show without even one word of dialoge.

2. The disc and it contents are unbelievable and add true value to a already GREAT FILM. There is just a bit of redundancy in some of the documentary materail but this can be forgiven. The ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"" is highly recommended to all who love and respect Gregory Peck.

3. To Kill a Mockingbird in either book and film form provides us true examples of the best and the worst tendencies of mankind.

Atticus Finch for instant is what every Father should be and is the lawyer we would want defending us if we were in trouble. On the other hand Mr. Ewell is the devil himself.

52757,5,0783225857,"Harper Lee wrote a semi-autobiographical novel about memories she made growing up in small town Alabama during that time between the Civil War and World War II, when blacks had been emancipated, but many whites, especially in the South, were reluctant to acknowledge blacks as equals.  The setting of this story preceded Martin Luther King, Jr's work by two decades. The novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the most important, passionate, beloved, spiritual and moral works in the English language.  It rightfully was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, and if only one had been awarded for the entire 20th century, it would still get my vote.

Rightfully so, Harper Lee was hesitant to see her beloved story turned over to ""Hollywood"".  She needn't have worried.

""To Kill a Mockingbird"", the film, has become as beloved as Harper Lee's book.  When the American Film Institute came out with their many ""100 Greatest..."" lists at the turn of the century Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch came out at #1 on the list of ""Greatest Screen Heroes"", ahead of such screen icons as Indiana Jones, James Bond and Rick from ""Casablanca"".  The film itself ranked as #34 of Greatest Films of history.  I would personally rank it in the top 2.

The story is relatively simple.  A black man, Tom Robinson (in a noble performance by Brock Peters) is accused of raping a young woman from a ""white trash"" family.  The guilt of the black man is a foregone conclusion in this predominantly white southern town, but the Judge knows the only man in town with a chance to defend Tom.  The Judge asks Atticus Finch.  Atticus Finch is a widower, raising his two children on the salary of a small-town southern lawyer, frequently taking livestock and vegetables in trade for his services.  Atticus has many friends in town, and everyone who knows Mr. Finch knows that he is a man of saint-like honor.  Atticus never brags and much of what his own children learn about him comes from other adults who have known him for years.

Wisely approaching the movie from the same perspective as Harper Lee's original narrative, Robert Mulligan tells the story from the perspective of the Finch children: Mary Badham as daughter Scout (who seems about 10) and slightly older brother Phillip Alford as Jem.  Scout and Jem do the things that children do.  They play hide and seek.  They tell ghost stories.  They roll tires down the street.  And, most importantly, they watch their father defend an innocent man who is sometimes an inch away from being lynched.

The courtroom scenes are taut, with racial conflict simmering away like a pot threatening to boil over at any moment.  Atticus Finch keeps the lid on that pot.  The courtroom scenes here have not been matched by any film before or since.  Gregory Peck confided to Director Mulligan that he had won the Academy Award for him in just the scene at the end of the trial where Atticus silently packs up his papers and walks out of the courtroom.  If you haven't seen the film before - watch for this moment and you'll know what he meant.

Supporting performances perfectly compliment the transcendant one by Mr. Peck.  Robert Duvall makes an impressive screen debut in an important role that doesn't appear until the final moments.  Collin Wilcox Paxton captures the pitiful ""victim"" of the alleged rape, Mayella Ewell.  James Anderson is terrifying as Mayella's spitefully prejudiced father, Bob Ewell.  Estelle Evans plays Calpurnia, who mothers the motherless Finch children when Atticus must be away.  Frank Overton is authoritative and one of the only professional friends Atticus has as Sheriff Tate.  Paul Fix presides over the famous courtroom scenes, in addition to asking Atticus to carry the unbearable load of defending the case that can't be defended in that town at that time.

In America (and, dare I say, other parts of the world) issues of prejudice and racism have not completely subsided.  But the days of Emmitt Till seem long ago and far away.  It took something to change the minds or racist Southerners not that many generations away from slavery.  ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" has done as much to advance the principles of fairness and justice as any single work of history.  It's that important.",1133827200,3,4239,4.8442280945758
52758,5,0783225857,"The quality of the black and white on this DVD is excellent and the interviews with Scout and Gregory Peck are great.  I especially love the dialogue between the producer and director as they discuss each scene, as you choose them.",1133222400,4,231,4.634146341463414
52759,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird is without doubt Gregory Peck's finest work. When the author of To Kill a Mockingbird first saw Gregory Peck she was not convinced that he was the man to play the central role of Atticus Finch, indeed she thought him too young. But when she first saw Gregory Peck playing Atticus she remarked that it was like seeing her beloved ""Daddy"". When you watch Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch, he is so natural in the role, that you sense that he was born to play this role.

This film's screenplay adaptation of Harper Lee's book concentrates mainly on the courtroom scenes. But this film also considers other elements from the book too, including the relationship between the three children Scout, Jem and Dill with Boo Radley. Look out for the scene where the children decide to investigate the Radley home under the cover of darkness, the courtroom scene where Atticus appeals to the jury and the scene where Scout stops a murder intent mob in it's tracks. Though shot in black and white this does not rob the film of it's impact, indeed I felt the lack of colour gives the film a raw power all of its own. Furthermore, I guarantee that after watching this film you will want to read or indeed reread the book.

Both Gregory Peck's father and Harper Lee's father had sadly died soon after the end of production. Before Gregory Peck went to the Oscar ceremony Harper Lee gave him her father's gold watch for luck. It worked! At the Oscar ceremony Gregory Peck at long last received his highly deserved Oscar. A fitting tribute to a man that many people have come to view as Atticus Finch himself.",1132963200,3,1616,4.588235294117647
52760,4,0783225857,"Just the basics here.  We all know this is one of the finest films to ever be produced. I don't need to go over that. Just about everything worked. Wonderful book by Harper Lee, strong adaptation by Horton Foote, perfect casting, starting with Gregory Peck, understated directing by Pakula, mesmerising music by Elmer Bernstein.

The film itself never looked or sounded better than on this DVD. I have not tried some of the other releases to compare.  But the extras are just minimum.  The conversation with Gregory Peck? It is more of a home movie than an interview. You see him talk about his work for a total of less than 10 minutes. The rest of the time you see him with a lot of other people (presumably his family but the credits do not say), eating figs, just hanging out. I was hoping to hear him talk about his role and what he thought it meant.  Anyone else in the film?  Forget about them. Scout is the only other person involved that you see, and that was a wonderful extra.  You see Foote for maybe a minute and the great Elmer Bernstein for a total of 30 seconds.

Come on Hollywood, this is one of the best films ever made, you can give us more than this.  We get more extras than this for any Batman or Halloween picture.

If I had it to do over, I would probably just hang on to my VHS and wait until somebody did this right.

The bonus disc gave me an insight into Gregory Peck , whom I knew little about.  Like wise the interview with Mary Badham (who played Scout), provided me with additional enjoyment.  I watched this over the weekend with my three year old son Jacob, kids today don't go out of their way to watch anything in B&W, but such is the power of this movie, that he sat wide eyed waiting for the final arrival of Boo Radley.

So the connection was very intense.  I immediately bought the book and read it cover to cover on my own and I loved the book even more.  I was not forced to see it or forced to see the movie in a classroom like the students in the school I used to teach at.  I did all of this willingly.  When the 2 disk anniversary version of this movie was advertised on Amazon.com, I jumped at the chance to own the ultimate edition of this movie.  I think I bought it more for the extra features than the original movie since I had already seen it multiple times.  I was not disappointed.  The Special Features were tremendous.  To think that a movie that was so endearing and social relevant was actually filmed on the back lot of Universal Studios and was so ""movie fake"" was so good on the screen all  bound together by one of the best movie sound tracks ever written is a testament to the creators of this motion picture.  It is a classic.

52793,5,0783225857,"This movie is arguably America's greatest movie.  Based on Harper Lee's only novel of the same name, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a cinematic achieve that transcends time.  This movie, directed by Robert Mulligan stars one of America's most professional artists Gregory Peck.  Peck plays Atticus Finch, the widower-father of his son Jem and daughter Scout.

""To Kill"" is one of those few picture experiences where the movie translates the feel and essence of a book.  I remember the first time I read Harper's book and then catching the movie a few years later (I read the book in 1979) and I was mesmerized that Peck was to me, Atticus Finch.  Mary Badham was Scout and Philip Alford is Jem.

This movie is the standard for all art, for it speaks about transcendent justice and right over wrong, good vs. evil and the harsh realities these ideas and realities bring forth; but it also speaks to wonder, mystery, love and courage - things worth living for.

The extras are nice and seeing Peck in his twilight with his family is warm.  The bonus feature on making ""To Kill"" is great and many of teh people acting in the film as well as other social commentators, recall memories as well as the films social importance.

Thank you Gregory Peck; Thank you Harper Lee; Thank you to all who worked on this great piece of art...we are much better people for it.",1128556800,5,1354,4.604166666666667
52794,5,0783225857,"WOW! What more can be said about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Kill-A-Mockingbird/dp/B000071K5L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Kill A Mockingbird</a>&nbsp;that has not been said before. It is such an awesome film, thanks to author Harper Lee's remarkably ingenious novel. It is no small wonder she won the Pulitzer Prize for it and Gregory Peck held her in such high esteem. It was undoubtedly the piece de resistance in his long and chequered career.

The plot in the film is true to Harper Lee's novel. An adult Scout (played by Mary Badham) narrates and reflects on the events which took place over two summers when she was young girl, growing up in the Deep South, during the Depression-era 1930's. Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is her father, an attorney who has been appointed to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. Atticus confronts the racist father Bob Ewell (James Anderson) who has -- though we are not made immediately aware it -- beaten his daughter for befriending Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), the black man falsely charged of beating and raping her. In a parallel development, Scout, brother Jem (Phillip Alford) and friend Dell (John Megna) must learn to deal with their own fear and prejudice towards Boo Radley (Robert Duvall), the shy, gentle and mentally-challenged man who lives a few doors down from them in a derelict house. As the trial unfolds, Atticus reasons Tom Robinson is guilty only of pity and friendship towards a white woman, Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox). The Ewell's, who collectively represent a bigoted society that cannot tolerate racial integration, have merely claimed trial to cover their own social guilt or shame for associating with a black man, thus the jury falsely condemns Tom Robinson. Shortly thereafter, he dies under suspicious circumstances while being  transferred to a 'safe haven' in a neighbouring town. To avenge his humiliation in court, Bob Ewell attacks the Finch children. An unlikely guardian, Boo Radley, comes to their aid, killing Bob Ewell.

So, where's the dead mockingbird? Well, Harper Lee's more subtle than that. To kill a mockingbird is actually a metaphor. The children, Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are mockingbirds. They live their lives as innocently as the mockingbird. They mean no harm to anyone or anything, just as the mockingbird merely warbles his birdsong, never disturbing corncribs and such things.  Ultimately though, each character  is either physically or symbolically killed: Tom Robinson is an innocent man falsely convicted and killed; the innocence of the children is lost to the ugliness of racial strife, which nearly leads to their death at the hands of Bob Ewell; and Boo Radley who kills Bob Ewell should be tried for murder, but will not be arrested and charged because of his innocent nature and selfless act of defending the children. After all, to use the words spoken by Atticus earlier in the film, it would be ""a sin to kill a mockingbird"".

Director Robert Mulligan  does a splendid job of impressing this innocence upon the viewer. At the beginning of the film, he zooms into Jem's cigar box of memorabilia which he collects over the course of the story, then pans the camera while Scout thumbs through the crayons, marbles, broken pocket watch and figurines. As she hums away like a hummingbird, Mulligan immediately creates a mood of innocence through the eyes of a child.  He carries on with the day-to-day simplicity of childhood in a sleepy Southern town, until half way through the film; then we begin to see this innocence slowly whittled away, much in the way Harper Lee does in her book.

Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch gives a reserved and dignified performance of his character, certainly deserving of his Academy Award. The children were naturals. Brock Peters (who passed away a few months ago) as Tom Robinson offers a plaintive and stirring performance. A young Robert Duvall, in his film debut, as the mute, gentle Boo Radley delivers a tremendous performance just with his eyes, facial expressions and body movement, saying more than some actors say in words, in a whole movie.

I've also got to praise Universal Studios for getting this boxed DVD set right ""To Kill a Mockingbird (Legacy Series Edition)"". The 2005 release is a vast improvement over the 1998 version. On DVD 1, the film can be viewed with or without the director's comments. On DVD 1 and 2, there is a documentary on Gregory Peck, his family and friends, as well as archived clips dealing with ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". All are appropriately interspersed, adding genuine warmth and depth to the man who portrayed Atticus. Quite surprisingly, we discover the actor and character were in many ways one and the same person. Wait, this boxed set also comes with several postcards depicting various versions of the film's theatrical posters, which illustrate if anything how immensely popular the film was and remains to audiences around the world.

In closing, I must say ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is at once an amazingly simple, yet profoundly universal story. Strip away its period setting of the 1930's; its occurrence in America's Deep South; and we realise the events could just as easily happen today, anywhere in the world, to anyone. Above all, it is a story that teaches the importance of fairness, justice, respect and love, for it is in these noble acts man learns to transcend his horrible propensity for prejudice, intolerance, ignorance and hatred.",1127692800,5,5509,5.096452328159645
52795,5,0783225857,I first read the book & loved it so when the movie came out I had to watch it. It is the only movie that followed the book totally. If you have read the book you will love the movie. The charters are so real. And the white trash girl who said the black man had raped her really wants you to slap her down. Her father is a red neck idiot. You will like the black man from the beginning. He really is a good man & would never touch a white woman. He would not rape any woman. And Gregory Peck is wonderful as his lawyer. And the children. So interesting. And the slightly slow man who is their friend. A+ movie from beginning to end.

52796,5,0783225857,"This movie is like a magnet to just about everyone I know.  As soon as you say the title peoples eyes light up and they always say ""I LOVE THAT MOVIE!!"".  It's rare that a movie has such universal appeal that even my nephew who was seven at the time he saw it loved it and wanted to see it again.  I remember watching this when I was young.  It was so dark and there was such an air of seriousness (I was too young to realize everything happening in it) and the kids were literally so much like kids in my neighborhood accents and all.  The mystery of Boo Radley scared me silly but I couldn't help but watch it.  All I knew was that Gregory Peck was a dad that was too cool for words, who reluctantly shot a rabid dog in the street and who had a voice that would go right through you.  It left such an impression on me.  Especially Scout in the ham suit!

 Later when I actually knew what was happening in the movie.  I fell even deeper in love with this film. The relationship Scout and Jem had with their father was wondrous and moving.  There was such an air of admiration for Atticus from just about everyone.  Gregory Peck's performance as the widowed lawyer with 2 kids showed the strength, grace, dignity and vulnerability of Atticus Finch during the trial and aftermath of Tom Robinson the black man accused of rape.  Mary Badham's performance as the mischievous and willful tomboy named Scout who lovingly reminisces about her mother with her father is so pure and innocent.  She and her brother Jem's decision to make the town recluse come out of hiding is a fateful one that will forever change their lives.  The book was a masterpiece and although the film couldn't possibly include everything that was in the book all is forgiven because the film is a masterpiece in it's own right.",1126483200,3,1796,4.380664652567976
52797,5,0783225857,"""To Kill A Mockingbird"" premiered in U.S. theaters on Christmas Day 1962. Those who were lucky enough to see this movie on the big screen that December 25th came out of the theater with another Yuletide gift of sorts -- they had just watched one of the finest motion pictures ever produced (IMHO).

There probably aren't enough glowing adjectives in the dictionary to describe the loveliness of this film. A truly fabulous piece of American cinema -- all the way through -- with a tender and bittersweet ending that always leaves one of those ""trying to hold it back"" lumps in the ol' throat.

The cast is ideal, with each actor seemingly molded for each of their individual roles. There's ""Scout"" (Mary Badham), ""Jem"" (Phillip Alford), ""Dill"" (John Megna), ""Boo Radley"" (Robert Duvall), and ""Tom Robinson"" (Brock Peters).

And ""Atticus Finch"" (Gregory Peck), one of the truly most memorable characters ever brought to the screen. And it's hard to think of how Mr. Peck's Academy Award-winning portrayal of that southern lawyer and father could have possibly been any better than we see it here. Peck always seems to have that ""controlled"" quality in his movie performances that are always a pleasure to watch. And never more so than as the low-key ""Atticus"" in this film. I doubt that it's possible to watch this movie and NOT admire the strength of character and unwillingness to stoop to such levels of vulgarity after Atticus is spat upon by ""Bob Ewell"". It's one of several scenes in the film that illustrates the type of man Atticus is, and the type of example he's setting for his young children. Some might be apt to call Atticus a coward in that scene. But they'd be wrong.

This film offers up many highly-memorable moments indeed --- Atticus sitting in front of the jail reading by the light of his living-room stand lamp. .... The mystery of Jem's ripped pants. .... Boo Radley's spooky house. .... Atticus impressing his children when he shoots the rabid dog. .... That old hollowed-out tree that keeps filling itself up with all kinds of cool stuff. .... ""Stand up, your father's passing"". .... Plus, that beautiful and stirring Elmer Bernstein music score. Utter magic.

There's also a good deal of humor residing in this screenplay. I always get a good healthy laugh when viewing the scene which has dinner guest Walter Cunningham Jr. drenching his dinner in syrup, to the shock and dismay of Scout  --- ""What in Sam Hill are you doin'?! He's gone and drown-ded his dinner in syrup and now he's pourin' it all over!"". :)

And possibly the most memorable quote comes at the end of the film, when Atticus says to Scout: ""Miss Jean Louise -- Mister Arthur Radley"". With these few words, Scout's fears of ""Boo"" vanish forever. The dignity with which Atticus ""introduces"" Arthur (""Boo"") to Scout is what makes this quote memorable for me.

Universal Studios Home Video, on September 6, 2005, issued a beautiful-looking new Two-Disc DVD version of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", which comes with a bountiful helping of bonus supplements, as well as the very first ""enhanced"" (Anamorphic) Widescreen transfer of the film on DVD.

Packaged under its ""Legacy Series"" banner, this 2-Disc Set sparkles in virtually all respects, especially the video quality of this iconic black-and-white film. It looks very nearly perfect to my eyes. Very few distracting artifacts can be observed during the running of this 130-minute main feature (which is presented in its intended 1.85:1 Widescreen framing here). And the nighttime scenes are rendered in fine fashion, with next to no video annoyances visible at all. The film passes the ""Freeze Frame"" test as well -- i.e.: you can ""pause""/""still"" an image on screen in virtual perfect clarity, without the image blurring at all, which I usually take as a pretty good sign that what I'm seeing is a darn-good transfer of the material to DVD.

There's a choice of five separate audio options for the feature film on Disc 1 -- with one of the five being a Commentary Track with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula, which was recorded for the first DVD edition of ""TKAM"" in 1998. Tragically, Pakula was killed in a freak auto accident in November of 1998, not too long after he recorded the commentary track for the DVD. He was 70 years old.

Other audio options for this two-disc edition include the original English Mono (in 2.0 Dolby Digital), a French 2.0 DD Mono track, and two newly-created multi-channel 5.1 Surround audio tracks (a Dolby Digital 5.1 plus a DTS 5.1). The DTS track isn't listed in the specs on the packaging, however. But it IS on here.

Audio tracks cannot be changed ""on the fly"" (as the saying goes) while watching the movie (unfortunately). You must go to the ""Languages"" Sub-Menu to switch the audio. To switch to the Commentary Track, you must access the ""Bonus Features"" Menu on Disc 1. There's no ""Commentary"" option available from the ""Languages"" Menu (for some reason).

Subtitle options: English, French, and Spanish. .... These subtitle choices are also ALL available when viewing any of the Bonus Features throughout this two-disc DVD set (including even the movie's trailer).

A bonus item that was originally scheduled to be a part of this set, but was ultimately not included, is a replica of Gregory Peck's ""working script"" (with handwritten notes by Peck). That bonus was evidently replaced by the 11 ""Theatrical Poster Reproductions"" that are included here. These poster art copies are very nice, being re-printed on high-quality paperboard stock, which have a glossy look to them. Included are a few USA poster copies, plus several from foreign nations, like Argentina, Japan, Italy, Poland, among others. The artwork's country of origin is printed on the back of each of these reproduction prints. A well-done extra bonus, IMO. (Although I would have loved to have had Mr. Peck's working TKAM script too. But, oh well.)

Also in the envelope with the 11 poster re-prints is a signed message from ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" author Harper Lee.

Let's have a look at the DVD Bonus Features.............

Disc 1:

....Gregory Peck's acceptance speech after he won the Oscar trophy as ""Best Actor 1962"" (the only Oscar statue he was ever to take home, amazingly enough). This vintage 1963 B&W video clip runs for 1:28.

....Excerpt from the ""Academy Tribute To Gregory Peck"", with Gregory's daughter Cecilia. This is a 10-minute bonus item.

....""American Film Institute Life Achievement Award"" presented to Gregory Peck. Run Time: 10 minutes.

....""Scout Remembers"", which is a 1999 NBC-TV interview with ""Scout"" herself (Mary Badham). This bonus runs 12 minutes. .... Mary Badham, for those who may not know it, is the sister of John Badham, who directed such motion pictures as ""WarGames"" (in 1983) and the enormously-popular and successful John Travolta film ""Saturday Night Fever"" (in 1977).

....The Original Theatrical Trailer for ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (Length: 2:53). The trailer is in Full Frame (1.33:1) format. Excellent sound quality too. Video quality is lacking a bit, but it's not too bad.

....Production Notes. (Text screens only.)

The only thing missing here are the ""Cast And Filmmaker"" bio text pieces that were included on the '98 disc. Too bad, too, because those biography notes were quite good (and extensive), and covered several of the various TKAM players and execs.

Disc 2:

There are two first-rate documentaries on the second disc of this set. These two extra DVD programs amount to 3 hours and 7 minutes of added ""Mockingbird"" entertainment, pretty much the equivalent of two entire additional movies.

The Disc-Two programs are:

""Fearful Symmetry: The Making Of 'To Kill A Mockingbird'"" (90 minutes; B&W; Non-Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 24 Chapter Stops). .... This is the same feature-length, behind-the-scenes documentary that was also included on the earlier DVD release of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". Wonderful stuff here. Lots of interesting details about how this classic film got to the screen. Includes many on-camera comments by Gregory Peck. Produced in 1998.

-- And: --

""A Conversation With Gregory Peck"" (97 minutes; Color & B&W; Full Frame 1.33:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 18 Chapter Stops). .... This sensational movie-length documentary was produced by Gregory Peck's daughter (Cecilia) in 1999. It is a very nicely-constructed presentation, with a good music score too, which delves in great depth into the personal side of the great Gregory Peck, who proves here that he was still more than capable of holding an audience's undivided attention at age 83.

This documentary could very easily have been called ""Gregory Peck's Life: In His Own Words"". It's quite literally a biography on the personal life and movie career of Mr. Peck. It's certainly one of the best ""bio"" pieces I've ever seen on the life of any actor.

This ""docu-bio"" contains video clips of many of Peck's films, plus old home movies, several talk-show clips featuring Gregory, and lots of other interesting stuff that help to give even more insight into the life of this amazing American actor (who was born in California on April 5, 1916).

Gregory Peck takes center stage during portions of the program (literally), as he talks and jokes with large audiences around the United States, and conducts various Q&A sessions.

There's lots of candid footage of Peck (and family) here too, including some impressive shots taken at Niagara Falls. And in Paris, too. And Ireland. And in Washington, D.C., as Gregory gets an award from then-President Bill Clinton.

Near the end of this thoroughly-engaging bio/""Conversation"", we see proud granddaddy Gregory holding his just-born grandson (who was named ""Harper"", after TKAM author Harper Lee). The scenes of Little Harper will make you want to reach into your TV and scoop up this adorable munchkin. He's one of the cutest little tykes I've ever laid eyes on. It's no wonder Gregory looks so proud here. These tender scenes with Gregory and his new grandson add the perfect sweet and sentimental finishing touches to the whole documentary.

This ""Conversation"" bonus is a genuinely unique program. It was produced with an obvious large dose of love and affection by Mr. Peck's daughter (and all others who were involved in putting it together). After viewing it, you can't help but feel like you know (and admire) a man named Eldred Gregory Peck quite a bit better than you did just ninety-seven minutes earlier. And that might be the best compliment I can pay this very special and heart-warming documentary.

Mr. Peck passed away in June of 2003, four years after he filmed this program. He was 87. He will be missed forever by multiple generations of movie fans who loved his work in the cinema for many decades. His talent is one that we'll likely not run across again, until we reach heaven. But thank goodness for fabulous documentaries like this one, plus all of his cherished films as well, which enable fans to retouch the magic and greatness that will forever be associated with Mr. Gregory Peck.

----------------

The packaging for this ""Legacy Series"" edition has a very solid and collectible feel to it. It's a three-panel folding ""Digipak"" type of a case, which sports an attractive ""leathery"" texture on the outside of the case. Unfortunately, there's no outer slipcase box (sleeve) included here, which will probably displease some collectors who wish to display this set ""face out"". That'll pose a small problem, because the case always wants to ""spring"" back open (due to the lack of a restraining outer slipcase). An outer box would certainly have been useful, but even without one, this package stands out as a ""classy"" DVD item on the shelf.

Additional Packaging Note -- This ""Mockingbird"" set is not packaged the same as ""The Sting"" (another Universal 2-Disc Legacy set). ""The Sting"", which is also worthy of a purchase IMO, comes in a two-panel ""book-like"" pack, which ""snaps"" firmly closed on the outside -- just like the ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" 2-Disc Limited-Edition DVD release, which came out in April 2001.

For continuity sake, I would have preferred the ""Sting"" type of closeable Digipak for the TKAM release. The two sets would look better side-by-side if they'd been packed the same. But, no big deal really.

Both the ""TKAM"" and ""Sting"" Legacy versions lack any Chapter List inserts or paper enclosures (which is a bit of a debit). However, if you own the previously-released single-disc DVD ""Collector's Edition"" of ""Mockingbird"", I'd recommend hanging on to the excellent multi-page fold-out insert that came with that disc. It can be used with this new DVD set as well. It has a complete Chapter Selection listing for both the movie and the ""Fearful Symmetry"" documentary, and the chapter breaks are in the exact same spots on this newer Legacy version, with the same chapter titles used as well (39 total Scenes/Chapters for the Main Feature). There are also some interesting Production Notes and photographs printed on that 1998 TKAM insert.

Also -- Make sure to disregard the ""Color"" notation marked on the loose piece of paper on the back of the DVD case that lists this ""Legacy"" set's contents. The film is in B&W, not color. That's obviously just a misprint.

A Final Glowing Blurb.......

""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a masterpiece of personally-felt moods and memories. Who among us doesn't have at least one childhood memory that can be rekindled through the actions of Scout, Jem, or Dill? This is a motion picture you can watch again and again -- and each time take away something different when that incomparable final act fades to black (usually something that requires yet another hard swallow with which to combat that ever-present lump in the throat that this movie masterfully induces each and every time it's watched).

Any DVD collection of great American motion pictures is unquestionably incomplete if ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" does not occupy a prominent position on the shelf reserved for such magnificent movie treasures.

52798,5,0783225857,"The word ""classic"" is liberally applied to just about any film that made any list or won any award over the past 100 years of cinema. It's a word that has been cheapened by its overuse in marketing. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" defines the word classic. It's not because of the top notch production although that's part of it. This film belongs to an era when craftsmanship was an important part of storytelling. In our world of rapid fire cutting where bodies pile up faster than the credits pass by, we've lost touch with the sensibility that informs this classic film. Robert Mulligan's sensitive direction, Gregory Peck's iconographic performance and a literate, intelligent script by Horton Foote (""Lonesome Dove"") that doesn't pander to the audience makes ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" one of those rare films that deserve the term classic and also deserves to be  on every best list for films made during the 20th century.

Based on Harper Lee's popular novel, ""Mockingbird"" tells the story of widower Atticas Finch (Peck) a small town  southern attorney who tackles the difficult defense of African American Tom Robinson (the late Brock peters) accused of raping the Caucasian daughter of a racist father (James Anderson). The film doesn't just focus on the rape trial though as it also chronicles the little things in Atticas' life that go right and wrong; his daughter Scout (Mary Badham) faces criticism at school for defending an African American and also her shift from tomboy to young lady. She and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) tell tales of the local bogeyman Boo (Robert Duvall)who lives down the lane and sharing their views on the adult world that passes them by. The film is informed with the southern atmosphere but ironically was shot entirely on Universal's backlot in Southern California. It would have been very easy to portray Atticas as a paragon of virtue. He's well meaning but just as flawed as everybody else in the town and that includes missing cues during the trial that could prove Tom's innocence early on. The fact that everyone-from the children to the adults-all treated with respect as to their view of the world makes ""Mockingbird"" an enduring classic that aged incredibly well. Like the best wines the rich themes in this film continue to resonate and intoxicate an audience nearly fifty years after the film was made. That's a testament to great filmmaking. While director Mulligan and producer Pakula would make a number of other notable and powerful films, this is the first pillar in their long careers and because of its strength the rest of their best films could be made.

Universal has taken a lot hard knocks lately about the quality of their DVD releases and lack of extras. They should also be recognized for the exceptional job they've done with this re-release. The black and white images are truly startling with rich fine detail, an exceptional gray scale and sharp image quality. The soundtrack is equally good with a top notch 5.1 new transfer as well as the original 2.0 mono soundtrack..

The features on disc one include Peck's acceptance speech for his Academy Award for the role of Finch, Peck's remarks at the American Film Institute Award ceremony honoring him. There's also an excerpt from the Academy tribute to Peck with Cecilia Peck remarking on the passing of her father. Finally there's ""Scott Remembers"" an interview with Mary Badham about working with Peck as a child actor.

The second disc features the bulk of the extras with two marvelous documentaries one of them brand new to this edition. ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"" directed by Barbara Kopple and produced by Peck's daughter isn't the usual intimate one-on-one chats were used to seeing. Instead, Kopple films an appearance by Peck in Boston to discuss his work as an opportunity to look at his life and career. Peck comes across with his usual sense of sincerity and is engaging. The documentary ""Fearful Symmetry"" about the making of the film was available on the previous DVD. Director Charles Kiselyak interviews everyone from director Mulligan to the now adult child actors that appeared in the film discussing not only Lee's world but how it was reflective of the world they grew up and lived in when the film was made. Interweaving that footage with location interviews with the people of the town that Lee wrote about in the book (where she herself grew up) , it's a fascinating glimpse into the fantasy vs. reality of Lee's world and how they intersect. We also get reproductions of the original posters for the film as part of the package from its exhibition around the world. Universal has done a truly spectacular job with this re-release to commemorate this classic film.

Luckily Mulligan and Pakula (both now deceased) did a commentary for an earlier edition of the film. That commentary appears yet again on this edition. While there's long passages of silence, that's OK; neither man blabbers on instead making very focused precise comments about the making of the film and their intent.

A truly outstanding release from Universal, I'd highly recommend ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" for purchase. If you have the earlier edition, this edition does offer the advantage of a new documentary, the lobby cards as well as a brilliant transfer of the classic film while retaining most of the extras from the previous edition. It's well worth visting with Atticas Finch and his family again.",1126137600,4,5426,4.928884026258205
52829,5,0783225857,"The movie is a classic, and even though it is in black and white, its authenticity to the book, except in just a few details, adds to its

significance.

The director of the movie took the liberty to put Scout in a papier mache hard cased ham costume, while in the book she was in a chicken wire and cloth costume, which added to the danger when she was attacked by Mr. Ewell. The wire was flexible and hard on the skin. Also, in the final scene in the movie Boo was hidden by the door, whereas in the book he was just in the corner and visible to all.

Robert Duvall played an excellent Boo in his debut role. Gregory Peck was a precise and perceptive Atticus Finch. The actor who played Tom Robinson recently died, but gained fame in his role. It is interesting to note that the character of Dill was patterned after Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote, in her own words.

While she spent four years writing the novel, which eventually earned the Pulitzer Prize, her audience and readers have enjoyed many years enjoying not only the book, which is one of 130 banned books because of the exposure of racism, but also the movie.",1125705600,3,1138,4.404761904761905

Gregory Peck's character is so dynamic, upstanding, courageous and human, that he stands above virtually all other masculine roles, and provides us with a hero for the ages.  The story is about fighting racism and injustice in the South, and Peck plays a small town lawyer who risks life and liberty to save a framed black man from the gallows.  Other heroes of like stature come to mind, seeing this movie, including Martin Luther King, Abe Lincoln, Jesus, Gandhi, and select few others.  I do wish they would make more of this type of movie.

I don't think Gregory Peck ever did a bad movie in his film career and he shines in this one.  As Atticus, he displays the kind of lawyer that you would want if you ever had to go to trial for anything.  He also displays a pretty good example to all us fathers on how to deal with our children.  There are some very good ideologies displayed in this movie.  The idea that all men are equal in the eyes of the court was displayed with Atticus defending a black man against a flimsy rape charge.  I'm not sure in 30's Alabama you could ever get a fair and impartial jury on this count.  This is a very satisfying movie that everyone, including your children, should watch.  The movie really hits home in alot of areas and is well worth adding to your movie library.",1121990400,3,937,4.308571428571429

Having been raised in the deep South, this movie eloquently captures a time during the Depression when people were poor, hungry, scared, and ignorant.  The character of Atticus Finch quietly parsed the poverty and ignorance of his town with educated intelligence and the soul of a good man ... as his children watched in amazement.

The casting, acting, photography, and musical score bring Harper Lee's original story to life.  The black and white film is perfectly fitting.  Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus was his very best work.  I still watch him in awe.

My grandmother watched this movie with me when I was a little girl.  I recommend that all grandparents watch To Kill A Mockingbird with their grandchildren and continue a beautiful tradition.",1121731200,4,846,4.901408450704225

52859,5,0783225857,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is at the time of my writing this ranked at #41 on IMDb's top 250 list (of movies of all time.)
I haven't read Harper Lee's price-winning novel on which the movie is based, but watching the movie today (my second time in a year) reminded me of how much I wanted to experience the original story, in print, in addition to the film.
Gregory Peck, who'd started working on Broadway and in movies 20 years prior to this film, does a very stable and critically acclaimed (Oscar rewarded) performance as Atticus Finch - a small town lawyer who, in 1930's Southern America, is defending a colored man (accused for rape by a white woman) in court.
Much of this 1962 B&W movie, which incidentally includes Robert Duvall's film-debut, is played out through the eyes of Finch's motherless children, ""Jem"" and ""Scout.""
I recommend it highly to anybody anywhere, regardless of age and culture, as it contains no ""foul language"" or ""severe violence."" Sure - the story might not be very accessible to a five year old, but the content of the movie is not bound to hurt anyone. For all the viewer is aware, this could be a recreation of actual historic events, which it in a sense is.
The music, composed by Elmer Bernstein, undoubtedly suites the picture and partly reminds me of musical elements (harmonically and in instrumentation) from harp-dominated 1950's Ingmar Bergman pictures (such as ""Smiles of a Summer Night."")
Though probably not within the incoming year or two, I'm sure I'm going to watch this movie again.
The well-restored sound and (widescreen) picture of this DVD features an insightful 90 minute long ""making of"" documentary as well as a theatrical trailer and biographies over the movie's main actors. There are also Spanish subtitles and a French audio track.
For a regular film-lover to leave this classic unwatched would be like killing a mockingbird.

OBSERVE: This review, which I wrote in March 2005, was not for the gold cover Collector's Edition, for which the review currently appears!",1110326400,5,2024,4.866666666666666
52860,5,0783225857,"The movie To Kill A Mockingbird, like the book, transports one to an ideal childhood with a perfect parent. I loved the experience of entering that ideal family's world, especially the vivid atmosphere of the children's daily life in their town and era, and the subtle ways the children are led to discover the truth about some of their mysterious neighbors.

At the end the way the viewer, through the children's eyes, himself discovers such a truth and experiences with them a moment of revelation--the sort of unforgettably meaningful moment that is a milestone in the road to growing up--drives home the theme: it is wrong to pre-judge, it is just to defend the innocent ""mockingbirds"" of the human race. The bending of rules at the end to protect one such mockingbird is utterly right and is justice; finally, a good, even heroic, act is rewarded.

It is to me a nearly perfect film adaptation, capturing the book's mood and spirit and meaning exactly. I only wish that the movie could have been a 1962 miniseries (there were none then) so it could have had every scene from the book. I never wanted the book to end.

My one small complaint about the film is that the courtroom scenes are presented a bit too much like a filmed stage play or a TV drama of the time, not as vividly realistic in its direction as the rest of the film. The actors playing the Ewells are also not up to the level of the other actors, reducing the quality and believability of the courtroom scenes.",1109030400,3,1481,4.581132075471698

If you want to know what life was like in the 30's this is it.  Ms. Lee's writing is a wonderful blend of child like innocence and the intelligent pen of a mature woman.

52863,5,0783225857,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is, in my opinion, absolutely the finest film ever made.  Filmed in timeless black and white and perfectly cast, this motion picture is a work of art.  As for the ""politically correct"" reviewer who panned the film because of perceived ""black stereotyping"", and suggested it not be shown to anyone under 21 years of age, all I can say is sad.....very sad.  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" should be required viewing for every child in public school in America, it might actually help to counter the influences of Darwinism and Secular Humanism that are destroying American culture and civility.

The performance of Robert Duvall as ""Boo"" Radley is, alone, worth the price of admission, but John Megna, as young ""Dill"" Harris, steals the film as far as I'm concerned.  Megna, the brother of actress Connie Stevens, passed away in 1995 but will always be remembered for his role as ""Dill"".

Everyone should, in my opinion, own a copy of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".  And if you watch it.....and aren't moved by it.....well, maybe you should have a close family member call the undertaker.",1104019200,3,1097,4.865591397849462
52864,4,0783225857,"I must agree with a previous reviewer in which he/she stated that this film is dated and precious. It's a difficult film not only to watch but enjoy because the blacks in the film are all stereotypes of ""decent, hard-working, god-fearing Black Folk."" Calpurnia, the housekeeper in the Finch household, best represents the film's black stereotype. As a previous reviewer stated, she is the least outspoken black in all of film history and consequently the least interesting. The role is so offensive that this film is immediately disqualified from being shown to anyone under the age of 21.

I too wondered about Atticus being at home when his children were performing in a school play after dark. Was his day at the office sooooo fatiguing that he couldn't drag himself off the couch to accompany his children to school? Yes, it's okay for a good dad to impart important life lessons over the breakfast and dinner tables but shouldn't a good dad be concerned about his children's physical safety?

Why does Atticus let his 6 year old daughter run around the neighborhood - after dark? The Finches appear not to live in the best of neighborhoods: once, a mad dog is seen loping along the street and another time, a neighbor fires a gun at a ""prowler"" in his vegetable garden, (the prowler is actually one of the Finch kids.) And then there's a dark, spooky old house that harbors a hulking, reclusive man who - like the Finch children - sneaks around the neighborhood after dark. Once again I ask: why does Atticus let his 6 year old daughter run about their dangerous and questionable neighborhood after dark? In my opinion, Atticus is truly over-rated as the Good Dad.

In the end, the entire film is just too precious as stated. It's the sort of film that appeals to those with very select tastes - like high school English teachers. This film is just the sort of fare I remember being bored with during my school days.

You can safely pass on this one - but if you've dedicated your life to seeing every Gregory Peck film, or every film based on Pulitzer prize-winning novels, or every black and white film, you're duty-bound to take a look at it.

That it is a 45 year old film doesn't really matter. The ideas are timeless. Atticus says to his son upon being asked why he took the Tom Robinson case, 'because I couldn't hold my head up if I said no.'

The children are outstanding (hard to find in a movie).  You really get the sense of viewing this world through the eyes of a child.

The courtroom scene is by far the best ever made.  I get angry every time the verdict is read.  Gregory Peck's closing argument shows just how perfect he was for the role of Atticus Finch.

""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of those movies that have these great moments that stay with me:  Atticus shooting the dog, Scout looking at the watch, Jem and Scout running to defend Atticus from the mob, Tom Robinson in tears when he states his innocence, Reverend Sykes asking Scount to ""stand up"", Atticus inching forward when he is spit upon, Scout saying, ""Hey, Boo""...the list of these moments could go on and on.

I've seen it a number of times (more recently, this evening, in fact)..and while some parts of the film cause me to stop what I'm doing and take notice, other parts do not.  In addition, the courtroom scene is too painful to watch..not because I am bored to tears, necessarily, but because I cannot stand hearing the testimony of the woman who claims to have been assaulted by an innocent black man.  I find her blatant lies unnerving to hear and her whole testimony highly irritating. Either the actress who plays her can't act, or she's so good it makes me want to clobber her, but I hate that scene.

To me, the best part of the film is simply watching Gregory Peck and the two young actors who play his children..but as for the story itself..though moral and good, it seems rather disjointed and you wonder what's the point.

The story is one in which all the characters are able to learn something new about themselves as well as life.  I found the entire movie to be very intersting and it held my attention the whole time.  I think we can all learn something from the experiences of the characters in the movie To Kill A Mockingbird.  I highly recommend this movie to others.-Christina",1097452800,4,860,4.503225806451613

Gregory Peck plays the #1 hero of all time, Atticus Finch, who is on a mission to do what is right whatever the costs may be. He faces many hindrances along the way, but takes them like a man and refuses to give up. By defending a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of rape, he does what no other attorney in Maycomb has the courage to do. Atticus' acts also have a deep effect on his children, Jem and Scout who remember his incrdible bravery forever. I love how this film shows that people don't have to succeed to be heroes. Good things can come from the effort, too. You are crazy if you do not at least like this film. It is an American classic that cannot be forgotten.",1097193600,,755,4.213793103448276

As to the movie, I've seen it dozens of times since I was 6 and it is one of the few movies that can touch the hem of the garment of the book (though it did change a few things, and leave some parts out--for example, Tom Robinson was shot 17 times and not once in the leg, and he was shot trying to escape prison).  It is a beautiful movie, despite the ugliness and three of the best played scenes are when the black minister tells Jean Louise Finch (Scout) ""stand up.  Your father's passin'"".  The other is at the beginning when Atticus is on the porch listening to Scout ask Jem what their momma was like.  You could feel the pain on Atticus' face.  The third and most beautiful was when the adult actress voiced over for Scout at the end and said she thought of those childhood times often--of Boo, of Tom Robinson..and of Atticus; and though you weren't told, you just knew that Atticus had died by then.

Also, I never felt that Mayella Ewell was evil.  Poor, deprived, ignorant and pathetic, but not evil.  In the book it was clear she had been molested by her father, who was definitely the villian in this tale.

The message of tolerance has been covered here, but my favorite part of this film is the qualities that Anthony Peck's Atticus Finch displays as a father.

52888,5,0783225857,"This is probably my very favorite movie - the one film that I would have to have if I was stranded on a desert island that, fortunately, had electric outlets, a televison and a DVD / VCR.

In a time when we've all become accustomed to these panoramic epics which command a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars and seek to spell bind the audience with breath taking special effects, To Kill A Mockingbird succeeds without having to resort to any of these.

This movie, filmed appropriately in black and white, tells the simple story of Atticus Finch, an attorney in the south of the 1930's who is raising his two children, Scout and Jeb. The story is seen through the eyes of Scout, a young girl, who is narrating the story many years later as a grown woman. And this is one of the important elements of this film. To Kill A Mockingbird is seen from a child's perspective and, as such, men like Atticus and the poor black man charged with the crime, Tom Robinson are seen as very honourable men (which is what they were.!!) almost wearing white hats while the evil people in the movie - the woman wrongfull accusing Tom of rape and her white, trailer trash father - are thoroughly despicable individuals more to be pitied than to be hated.

The movie's focal point - and it certainly was a very powerful one in 1963 when this movie was made - concerned Atticus Finch's defense of a black man who had wrongfully been charged with the sexual assault of a white woman, a crime in the 1930's south that usually bypassed the courts entriely and went directly to the nearest tree which had a limb big enough to throw a noose over.

This movie, of course, addresses racism and it must have opened alot of eyes in the 1960's when it was made in terms of addressing the progress, or lack thereof, that had been made in the intervening 30 years.

But more than that, it was very much a movie about growing up and how we saw the world and our parent(s) and adults and good and evil. The conclusions we came to and how the events of our youth shaped our lives and made us the people that we are today. It showed us, for example, that the boogey man ""Boo Radley""- wonderfully played by a young Robert Duval - was not so scary when you understood the real ""boogeyman"" was the flesh and blood father of the woman who cried rape.

Needless to say, Gregory Peck, who won the Best Actor award for his incredible performance of the decent Atticus Finch, was riveting. In a very low key and understated way, Atticus quietly exemplified all of the best qualities an individual could possess - honour, honesty, self-respect.

This wonderful movie was based on Harper Lee's best selling Pulitzer prize winning novel. Surprisingly, Harper Lee never published anything more of significance after this book. In retrospect, how could you possibly follow up ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". I think it would have been comparable to following the Beatles after their initial Ed Sullivan appearance.

This movie is one of those rare adaptations that actually adhered exclusively to the book and, as a result, was an artistic and commercial success. It's rare for a movie to ever approach the book in terms of quality (look at the movies based on Tom Clancey novels..!!).

Another wonderful contribution to this film was the soundtrack. The almost haunting quality of the music, coupled with the black and white cinematography, created a wonderful mood - both during the film's ligher moments as well as the terrifying moments(as seen through the child's perspective). It's a beautiful soundtrack and certainly merits inclusion in your collection.

This movie had a significant and lasting impact on me as an 11 year old seeing it for the first time. And many yearslater, it can still convey the same feelings in me that I felt back then. There's a very good reason why the book is considered mandatory reading in many American schools.

You will know how American children grow up at that time, how they develop their point of view, how they see, look and accept the reality.  The film also teaches you what is the courage, how to be courageous and in what situation we need to be courageous. For me the biggest theme that I have learn from this movie is that no matter who you are, where you're from, what you do, if anything wrong just happen to you,  just accept and face it as if it is a step you need to go through in you life. You must use all your courage to overcome any obstacle that might stop you on your way.

Kuldip Kumar Garhwal
""Mockingbirds don't do one thing but... sing their heart out for us. That's why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird."" The movie 'To kill a mockingbird' depicts the destruction of the innocent by the evils of the society. Mockingbird is a symbol of innocence, characterized by Tom Robinson and Arthur Radley (Boo) where racial prejudice and ignorance are the symbol of evils in the society.
Tom Robinson, an African-American is accused by Mayela, a white woman, of sexual molestation. Atticus, a prominent lawyer of the town Maycomb, has proved that Tom Robinson is innocent but still the ""all-white jury"" convicts Robinson of the guilt. Tom Robinson, a ""quite humble respectable Negro"", becomes the victim of racial prejudice. Arthur Radley (Boo) has been emotionally destroyed by his father, as his father did not let him step outside the house. Boo is one of the ""mockingbirds"" in the story, who is the victim of ignorance; evil of the society which is trying to kill the good. Boo had a deep affection for children, which is later displayed in the story, when Boo saves Jim and Scout from Bob Ewells.
""There are some men in the world who are born to do unpleasant jobs for us; your father is one of them"", said Maudie to Jim after his father (Atticus) lost the case of Tom Robinson. Atticus helped his children to learn values of life and he showed them how to live life by the values; preaching by practicing. Atticus allowed his children to call him by his name instead of 'father'. He wanted his children to explore freedom, but also taught them to stay in limits. Jim is brave, intelligent, and caring. He learns courage, dignity, and value of life from his father. He is transforming into adulthood.
Scout is still a kid; she does not know anything about the existence of evil in the society. She is learning about evils from the real life example of the victims (Tom and Boo) of the evils in the society. By the end of the story Scout's perspective on life develops from that of an innocent child into that of a near grown up. ""Mr. Tate was right"", said Scout to Atticus, after Mr. Tate, the town Sheriff explained Atticus indirectly that whatever Boo did was correct and he is not supposed to be punished for that. ""It would be like shooting the mockingbird, wouldn't it."" Scout shows a high level of ability to comprehend at the age of five, and understands the whole situation and judges what is right and what is wrong.
The Music Director of the movie has done an excellent job. Music plays an important role in the movie, by setting the mood for what is been screened. The movie starts with a musical note, which seems like it is played by a kid, one note at a time. The movie also has gothic music to create the horrifying or thrilling environment, when Jim and Scout were walking home after the Halloween Party and they had an encounter with Bob Ewells. Most of the places the movie has melancholy music to produce the feeling of thoughtful sadness. The pleasant arrangements of musical notes in the movie create an atmosphere where we feel that we are a part of the movie, and we go back into our nostalgic memories and look back into our childhood. The movie itself seems like a mockingbird song.
My favorite scene in the movie is when Atticus is walking out of the courtroom after the trial is over and all the ""colored"" people sitting in the balcony stands up to pay respect to Atticus, a white man, who tried his level best to save a ""Negro."" The Reverend says to Scout who was sitting, ""Stand up Jean Louise. Your father is passing.""  The scene says it all, there is not much dialogue but the expressions on the faces of the black people was marvelous, with a slow melancholy music at the background. As it this situation there is nothing left to say, because everyone knows in the courtroom that Tom Robinson is not guilty but still the jury has convicted him of the rape, just because of racial prejudice.

52902,5,0783225857,"'To Kill A Mockingbird' is of course the movie adaptation of Harper Lee's movie with the same title. Gregory Peck is a lawyer in rural Mississippi who is asked to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.
The movie starts however with a seemingly unrelated event, the lives of Atticus Finch's two children. His daughter is a tomboy and his son is trying to keep her from getting into more trouble. The stumble upon some strange items and look at the house of a strange man called Boo Radley.
Then the movie goes into the court case. It is of course very obvious that the black man is innocent, but this is 1930's South with an all white jury...
Then the two parts of the movie come back together again...
The acting in this movie (in black and white) is superb. I recall that Gregory Pecks perfomance was voted the best of the century. Even the little girl is superb, she even got a nominatation for an oscar. Boo Radley is played by Robert Duvall, though he says next to nothing and is only in the movie for a few minutes. He of course 10 years later would play Tom Hayden in The Godfather. For Star Trek fans: Tom Robinson, the black man accused, is Sisko's Father of DS9",1089504000,8,1183,4.333333333333333
52903,5,0783225857,"We shall say ""To kill a mockingbird"" is a classic of the century that unfolds reality into film with profound simplicity. Its character development along with the approach of realism supersedes many contemporary works of literature and film. The historic flavor of the film creates an impression of a southern community of America during the great depression. Apparently the quintessential theme of the movie is the social stigma and prejudice. We see conflicts between the blacks and whites in the same community where justice has upheld my one of the central character called atticus.
Tom Robinson, a black guy living in the same town called Mayconb was one of the central characters in the movie has been accused of raping a white woman. However, eventually he was convicted as guilty of charge and subjected to unfair justice system by the ignorant majority that have taken part in the jury. But there were other themes that also have significance to its crafts also. Its amazing reality of children's life that is so universal. It created a reality of vividing contention that helps the viewers to understand how the children see and think about the world. It also calls into attention of the activities that children by their vary nature involve in a family. For instance, Scout and Jem who are the central characters have enormous interests in scary yet joyful venture to Boo Radly's house even after being forbidden by their father. It was also important to observe how the children have collected gifts from the tree given by a isolated guy who they never been acquainted with.
The phenomenal curiosity of children is almost inescapable from the viewer's notice in the movie. They were inquisitive in every detail of what has been happening around them. That gives us the idea of their emotional reopens to the world and family relationships. As you will see, if you watch the movie, their father atticuls who has been a significant moral authority to them. He has great influence on how they develop the ideas of people and differences of good and evil that remain in their fantasy world.
The story of the movie has a unique way to tell you about a community and what is going on to its families. It takes us to the journey to reflect on our own childhood fantasy world and the adventures that still remains in our mind a thrill.",1089331200,3,2339,4.806451612903226

...the film adaptation has come down throughout my life less as a reminder of what it was like to roam through the wonders, fears, and frustrations of early youth than in Gregory Peck's magnificent depiction of what is expected of a man - as a professional, as a citizen, and as a father.
It is to the model set by my own father and to the portrayal of Atticus Finch in this film that I owe much of what has been good in the fulfillment of my duty to my community, to my patients, and to the children and grandchildren who were born into my responsibility.
If there is anything solid or valuable in the moral character of the male American ""Baby Boomer,"" it is attributable in at least some small way to the influence of this movie and the expectations it impressed upon us, consciously or unconsciously, in the darkened movie theaters of 1962 and 1963.",1088899200,3,857,4.430379746835443

52906,4,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird is immensely simple, echoing the languid mood of a small town, pre-television, pre-suburban isolation, and very much in the midst of ignorance and prejudice. Main character is Scout, a child growing up with older brother Jem who longs for manhood and her father Atticus Finch, a uniquely dedicated lawyer and good man. Racism is the issue that stands out in the end, but TKAM is more an exploration of a time and place that most of us will never--and might never hope to--know.

52908,5,0783225857,"Making justice in a film to the best novel in the twentieth century (determined by vote of librarians across the US) is not an easy task. I would say that although there are a few elements of the novel that get lost in the movie, it is still a great production regardless. That is probably why it was nominated for eight Academy Awards in 1962, including best picture, best actor (Gregory Peck), best actress in a supporting role (Mary Badham), best director (Robert Mulligan), best screenplay, best black and white cinematography, best black and white art direction and best original musical score. The movie won two of the eight awards, best art direction and best actor.
The story revolves around the experiences of Scout, a little girl who is telling a story from her childhood. Her father is assigned as the defense attorney of a black young man falsely accused of raping a white girl. The movie does a good job in disseminating the book's main message: racism is destructive and has no basis to exist in our society. If you consider that the book was written in 1960, this is not a minor point, but on the contrary it is a very powerful statement. The movie also does a great job in portraying the qualities found in the character of Atticus Finch, a father who is raising two kids by himself, after losing his wife, and is doing a splendid job at it. Not only he differs from the norm at the time because he never hits his children, but he also tries not to influence their ideas of what is wrong and right. Instead of promoting hatred in Scout and Jem against the people that are racist and unfair, he tries to teach them tolerance to understand that these individuals are acting mostly out of fear. Throughout the story one can observe how the two siblings go from considering Atticus an old man who could not play football with other dads to seeing him as a hero with outstanding values.
It is hard to decide how to rate a movie that is based on such an incredibly awesome book. First, because it is harder to convey the ""child's view"" in the movie while this is very clear in the book. Second because there are passages of the book that were left out, and although they are not crucial to the story they give it a certain charm (for example the visit of Jem and Scout to Calpurnia's church). Therefore, if I use the book as a benchmark, the movie should be rated four stars. However, I think it makes more sense to compare the movie with other movies, and in this comparison it is extremely clear that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is as good as it gets, consequently deserving the five stars rating.",1079136000,7,2605,4.486315789473684

In a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, the small town of Macomb, Alabama is portrayed in the summer of 1932, during the deepest depression that the United States had ever experienced. Over the course of the next year and a half, events will burrow inside this sleepy southern town and the lives of its residents will be transported by actions, ideas, perceptions and convictions that will influence one and all in ways that will ring true for years to come.
Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is a lawyer and widower, raising two small children, Scout (Mary Badham) and her older brother Jem (Phillip Alford). Into their lives enters a visitor, Dill (John Megna) from Meridian, Mississippi, come to spend two weeks with his Aunt Stephanie (Alice Ghostley). Macomb is a town with nothing to do and if there were, no money to spend on it. The stage is being set for a life shattering episode that will not go quietly into that good night.
Childhood holds its fascinations, its myths, its coming of age and through the eyes of the three children, the audience is allowed to peer into the adult world around them as perceived through the minds and souls of innocence that will be all too easily shattered as time whistles down the track. One of the stories woven so masterfully within its covers is the local urban legend of bogeyman, Boo Radley (Robert Duval), who lives on the same block as the Finch family. In a narration, rather like playing telephone, his persona takes on all the familiar attributes of a raving lunatic, a monster out for blood. His aura becomes the end all for Scout, Jem and Dill as they seek to master the mystery surrounding Boo and the ability to live to tell the tale!
Into this world of innocence, a shattering crescendo of complexity wraps itself in the lives of the townspeople in the form of an alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Violet Ewell (Collin Wilcox) by a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). Atticus Finch is called upon to act as counsel for Robinson and in doing so, the stage has been set for a dance with race relations and the exemplary lengths that are gone to in order to allow justice to prevail in the face of malcontent.
The performances throughout To Kill A Mockingbird are stunning. Gregory Peck, as the gentleman lawyer, mired in small town attitudes and thoughts that were so representational in the southern gothic sphere, has collected and held a restrained order to his character, and in the process, he has allowed us all to be on the receiving end of hate as conveyed through the actions of small minds and small people. The children, especially Mary Badham, are siblings of more than a movie making venture. They show the absence of preconceived notions, and the guile of beings before the actions of adults can render their world as lost and gone with the shedding of time.
James Anderson as Tom Ewell is the complete representation of oily slime as Mayella's father. He embodies all of the hate and prejudice that continues to be harboured to this day in the souls of those who would attempt to wield their vision of the way things should and ought to be. He has a foul baseness that lingers like a bad rash as he attempts to invoke his arguments through drunken bullying and hatred. Collin Willcox as Mayella is excruciatingly convincing as the bored, housebound white woman who tries to tempt Tom Robinson into kissing her and through her actions sets in motion a rollercoaster of tragedy to come. Her speech to the assembled courtroom is superb and as the audience, you feel her anger and resentment at having to be put in such a position, having to lie to save face and what little position she has in the town. Brock Peters as the aforementioned Robinson is equally sure in the allotted time he spends on the screen. There is a noble demeanor to his bearing, and yet we are aware of the restrictions that blacks were held to in their relationships with whites at the time.
Robert Mulligan, the director and Horton Foote, the screenwriter, have presented us with a look into our pasts and faithfully etched a portrait of quiet and artfully rendered proportions that draw us into the canvas and the lives of those assembled. We have walked a mile in their shoes and been under their skin. Foote worried about being able to do justice to Lee's novel, but he worried for nothing. He has completely evoked an era that now rests behind clouds of dust, blown by the winds of time into oblivion.
The cinematography by Russell Harlan and the set decoration by Oliver Emert carry us back through the courtesy of black and white to a depiction seen only in old photographs and clouding memories of those who lived in those precarious times. Black and white films seem to have had a curse thrust upon them by the younger generation today, as boring and tedious, but through the courtesies extended by Harlan and Emert, we are richer for those perceptions that would harken back throughout the pages of history.
Elmer Bernstein's film score carries us like an old friend and helps us to make our acquaintances with the characters held within this framework. He has achieved much with a simple theme and persuades us that said simplicity is fulfilled with less rather than more.
To Kill A Mockingbird is beautifully haunting and having been made in the 60's, at the height of the Civil Rights movement, it garners our attention to stop and take the time to truly 'see' what the human race is all about and what it can and should be, if taken over the bumps in the road and onto a path of sincere honesty and purpose. No special effects were needed, no huge Hollywood budget, no splashing of a story that had a happy ending for everyone involved. It is an open book into the realities of a world tilting temporarily off its axis, and being brought back on track through the goodness that sits in the hearts, minds and souls of mankind, if given half a chance.
See it and be amazed at what real moviemaking is all about.",1074643200,9,6257,4.612556053811659
52923,5,0783225857,"Midway through this outstanding movie, Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) defends a black man accused of raping a white woman in an Alabama town during the Depression. As the tensions of the trial reach fever pitch, Atticus is summoned home to protect his family from a rabid dog. The mad dog, an obvious symbol of the madness of prejudice (and the only symbolism in the movie) is killed by just one shot from Finch. This is one of the simple themes of the movie: all you have to do is confront and face bigotry, in order to eliminate it.
TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is undoubtedly one of the most important and most engaging movies of post-WWII America, and a cinematic emblem for the civil rights movement of that era. From the incredible opening credits, complete with Elmer Bernstein's heartbreakingly beautiful score, you know you're in for a great movie. Seen through the eyes of Atticus' tomboy daughter, Scout, the film runs the familiar gamut of a child's world: the scary neighbor; the new kid in town; the first day of school; and the need to be close to a parent. But the aptly named Scout also sees something that most other children do not: the dark world of grown-ups' hate.
But Scout is not just an observer; she's a fighter who's not afraid to duke it out with the boys in her school. In this way, she is a sort of foil for her father whose fighting spirit is internal, calm, but just as effective. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is full of outstanding performances. Gregory Peck is appropriately understated, although passionate when the moment calls for it. A very young Robert Duvall, in the bit but pivotal role of Boo Radley, conveys the pathos of a manchild locked away from the rest of the world. I defy anyone to watch Brock Peters as the wrongly accused Tom Robinson and not be moved. However, the movie is carried by the amazing and convincing performances of the child actors, Mary Badham as Scout and Philip Alford as her brother Jem. They are so genuine, so not like child ""stars"" (because they weren't), that, at times, you forget you are watching little actors.
This is a film to be watched on several levels but none more important than its stirring interpretation of childhood rapidly coming to terms with the adult world around them. It sounds trite and banal, but Horton Foote's screeplay, Robert Mulligan's textured direction, and the performances, sidestep any temptation to take the easy path of cliche. This is a demanding movie that requires a lot from us as film watchers and as human beings.",1074643200,2,2513,4.6749435665914225
52924,3,0783225857,"The narrative is smooth and the screenplay keeps you on your edge. Peck's good. The setting has a charged undercurrent of racism, which I am sure must've been very poignant during the movie's release. Yes, it's a great movie, especially on the digitally mastered DVD.
But it is not the magnum opus that people never seem to get enough of raving about. Perhaps it just hasn't aged that well.
The story is set in Alabama during the Great Depression. It follows the life of Scout Finch, a little girl growing up in those wretched times. Basically, it's about what's going on with the town and what's going on with Scout and her family throughout her growth, leading to different storylines of events that happens to Scout and the rest of the Finch's.
Probably the only storyline I really appreciated was the story of Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus (Scout's father) was defending Tom in a rape case, and since Tom was black, this was taboo in Maycomb. This pithily showed unfairness and how cruel prejudice and hate can be. Maybe if the movie was only centered around that story instead of throwing in aspects like Boo Radley, Dill, and others, I would consider calling this movie a classic. It didn't really help that Scout, who is supposed to be an innocent unknowing little girl, actually comes off as an annoying, loud, obnoxious brat that you'd want to slap throughout the entire movie.
There's some good acting  although Gregory Peck's wooden oh-so-conscientious face was nowhere near Oscar worthy, had it not been for the controversial theme. In the end, the courtroom scenes are perhaps the only engaging bit I would recommend this movie for.",1071446400,11,1645,4.833333333333333
52925,5,0783225857,"It's easy to think ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is older than it is. Released in 1962, the same year James Bond was immortalised in ""Dr. No,"" director Robert Mulligan chose to film in black & white, despite Hollywood's rush to adopt the new Kodachrome II color film. Since the story is set in the 1930's, the classic look of the film adds weight to its historic reality.
Adapted from Harper Lee's only book, which won a Pulitzer prize, the script itself won an academy award. Added to this is a stellar cast who manage to hold their own against the amazing performance given by, Gregory Peck, an actor at the peak of his abilities. For those who also enjoy Robert Duvall's huge body of work, it may be interesting to note this film as his first, in a non-speaking but pivotal role as Boo Radley.
It would be easy to dismiss an old film that deals with the race issue in Alabama. Some might think this topic has been done to death and, to an extent, they are right. But To Kill a Mockingbird is not solely about racism. It deals with honesty, justice, fear, childhood, quick judgements and parenthood. Even the race card is dealt with fairly, without blowing things out to sensational proportions. It shows that minor, selfish decisions, which rely on the racism in others, can breed larger evils.
An adult Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch narrates much of the story but it is her father, Atticus, around which the narrative hinges. Played with subtle dignity by Peck, Atticus is a small town Lawyer who agrees to defend Tom Robinson against charges of Rape. He agrees, in the full knowledge that many of his neighbours will hate him for defending a black man and still others will expect him to put up only a token effort. Instead, Atticus does what we know he will... his best.
There is an interesting contrast between what we see of Atticus and how his two children describe him. Apparently he's too old to do anything, like play ball, and they are a bit embarrassed by his quite ways. The trial and its associated moral battles put their father squarely in the spotlight and not in a good way. He and they are attacked and ridiculed but in the end Scout and Jem see a different picture of their old Pop. A man who is strong enough to stand against hatred, and brave enough to highlight the weaknesses of flawed white girl against the strengths of an honest black man.
The name of the film is taken from one of Attcus's rules relating to using a rifle. Jem relates his father's instruction ""to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird...Well, I reckon because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncribs, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us.""
There are several Mockingbirds in this movie; the misunderstood Boo Radley, Tom Robins and even Atticus. For me though, the film is defined when Reverend Sykes asks Scout to stand up in the court gallery, after a failed defence, saying ""Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passin.""",1069027200,20,3029,4.569852941176471

Gregory Peck is superb here as the lawyer Atticus Finch, an everyman thrown into the role of a hero of sorts among his prejudiced community.  Another highlight is the young actors playing his children; their acting, particularly Mary Badham as Scout.  Her final scene with ""Boo"" made me cry, which didn't happen  even when I read the book.  This is child acting like Macaulay Culkin never succeeded in showing.

  To Kill A Mockingbird takes place in an old southern town during the depression.  Atticus, portrayed by Gregory Peck, is a lawyer. Atticus is a widower raising a son, Jem, portrayed by Phillip Alford and a daughter, Scout, portrayed by Mary Bedham. Atticus takes on the case of a black man accused of assaulting and raping a white woman.
  The remarkableness of this film is how the children are exposed to prejudice, but keep their innocence and never become judgemental. The children's impression and admiration for their father grows throughtout the movie.  Atticus shares insightful things with them such as, ""you never really understand a man until you put yourself in his shoes and walk around in them,  also, ""it is a sin to kill a mockingbird for they only mean to please.""  ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is enjoyable and educational and it explores stereotypical prejudices of the deep south with many emotional experiences.

The movie comes to a dramatic finish when the mysterious Boo Radley saves the lives of Jem and Scout from the heinous attack by Mr. Ewell, Mayella's father.

Atticus is appointed to defend a black man who is accused of raping a white woman.  Many townspeople try to get Atticus to back out of the trial but his conscience won't let him.  Though Tom Robinson (the accused) is obviously innocent, the outcome of his trail is blatant proof of how prevalent prejudice is at that time.  Mr. Finch's conviction to defend Tom costs him some friendships but gains him respect among the black community and the admiration of his children.
You just cannot go wrong with this movie.  It shows how kids adapt to very serious situations around them but manage to keep the innocence.  Gregory Peck should be a role model for us all.

52945,5,0783225857,"The source of the movie is the Pulitzer Prize novel of the same name by Harper Lee, one of the most beloved works of literature.

What is the film about?  Its themes cover a wide range -- race, parenting, morality, and justice.  However, all these issues can be summed up in one concept repeated over and over again:  seeing a situation from the perspective of another person.  Atticus says to his children that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, because all it does is sing.  Through Atticus, the children come to see the mockingbird in an unjustly persecuted black man as well as in the ghostly-white neighborhood bogeyman.  But in small ways, we see the mockingbird in a poor farm boy, a querulous spinster, even in a man involved in a lynching attempt and in a woman committing perjury.  (One criticism:  the movie does not have time to explore the surprisingly noble qualities of two of the least appealing characters in the novel, Mrs. Dubose and Mr. Raymond.)  Imagine how different our world would be if we treated everyone with the dignity afforded them by Atticus Finch.

Alan Pakula gives every detail of his production exquisite attention.  The screenplay by Horton Foote deftly trims details and enhances other aspects of the novel without changing its spirit.  The score by Elmer Bernstein moves the heart, especially in the opening sequence that perfectly captures the playful wonder of a child.  The direction by Robert Mulligan brings out the very best in his actors.

Cinema has rarely assembled such a talented cast.  After MOCKINGBIRD, Gregory Peck was defined by his portrayal of Atticus Finch, the widowed lawyer explaining the complicated issues of life to his two children, leading by impeccable example to do right no matter how difficult the circumstances.  Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are two of the best child actors ever.  Robert Duvall, in his Hollywood debut, gives a riveting performance as a shy recluse, even though he barely speaks.

TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD tells us that even in the confusing complexities of the real world, one can still persevere and make the world a better place.  This movie is cinema at its finest.",1062201600,6,2157,4.857534246575343

To add to that, the casting is perfect; the character are all just how I imagined them. The children were particularly impressive, making their characters realistic; Mary Badham acts her role with a childish innocence, very relevant to her character of Scout, which delightful to watch.
  The movie is full of wonderful scenes, with the court trial being the highlight. Gregory Peck's closing defence speech consists of some of the greatest film dialogue of all time. For readers and non-readers of Harper Lee' book, this film will be enjoyable and shame on those (particularly a certain reviewer) who cannot appreciate its message.",1061596800,2,1005,5.0119760479041915
52947,4,0783225857,"Mockingbird killing revisited

Some classic movies remain relevant long after the era they portrayed passed into memory.  Some should be left untouched.  Except for the acting of Gregory Peck and Brock Peters, the movie version of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird seems like a slow moving story going at 33 rpm in a world that's on warp speed 40 years after the movies release.

The movie set in Black and White cinematography moves slowly with its plot introducing all the characters especially the children in little vignettes.  Yet for a movie about the mistreatment of African-Americans in the 1930's rural south, there is little exposition about the key figure, Tom Robinson, the man accused of rape by a spinster white women or the lives Blacks lived in that era.

The movie glorified the courage of Atticus Finch, played stoically by Peck, who took to the unsuccessful defense of Robinson, who dies off-screen, much as the activities of the blacks in this movie are used to highlight Finch's lack of prejudice.  Where the Whites in the movie are portrayed in shades of gray from unrelenting bigotry to middling tolerance,  all the black characters are presented as noble savages with great dignity and idol-like appreciation for the attorney's defense.  40 years ago there was a lump in my throat, when the Black community seated in the balcony of the courthouse, stood silently to honour attorney Finch, now there was a look to my watch to see when this tale would come to an end.

Some parts of this drama still work, the attack on Finch's children by the wronged spinster's father and defense by recluse Boo Radley played by Robert Duvall, still works well as well as the sheriff's(played by Frank Overton) failure to prosecute Radley.  However, even that ending is marred by the reverential liberalism that the racists death cancels out Tom Robinson's.  But every black character even the Finch maid and nanny, Calpurnia, is shown with respect and anonymity.  Its as if the movie's creative team were afraid to show three dimensional African American life, proving once again in the words of Nat ""King"" Cole, ""Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark.""

52948,5,0783225857,"I don't really feel the need to review ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" The editorial review and the opinion of the American Film Institute should say enough about the superiority of this work. Every actor gives a flawless performance. Atticus Finch is Gregory Peck's finest roll and his performance lives up to character. All the children are simply amazing. One performance that seems to get virtually no attention in reviews is Collin Wilcox Paxton as Mayella Violet Ewell. Ms. Paxton draws together an astounding collection of emotions and releases them in one to the most intense and frightening performances I have seen in any film. I remember seeing the film as a pre-teen (when it was new), and Ms. Paxton's anguished, screaming face is the image that is most vividly burned in my memory. She scared the bejeezers out of me.
There simply can be no reasonable rating less than 5 stars for this flawless classic. So I was curious to find out why some people would give it less!?! I scanned through all the reviews and found only a handful who, I feel, had legitimate reasons for giving 4 stars because they felt the DVD transfer was flawed.
I was amazed to find other reasons. Several school kids who had been forced to watch (and read) ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" who thought it was boring. Perhaps this says something about our schools, no? And maybe it says more about television.
Some people were upset because it was not in color. They were unable to get over their disappointment and see the movie as it is. It was made in black and white at a time when Technicolor ruled the screen. There is clearly a very specific artistic reason Robert Mulligan chose black and white. He made the right choice. The sense of the dusty, dry, poor depression era is beautifully reinforced by the black and white presentation.
But the most amazing review was one person that said ""Racism still serves a purpose...""!! Wow! I guess there are still Bob Ewells among us!
""Too Kill a Mockingbird"" is without doubt one of the finest examples of American filmmaking. Anybody (particularly any American) who can appreciate the finer things in life, and has any sensitivity to the complexities of human society, should watch this film.

52959,5,0783225857,"In his later years, Peck acknowledged that Atticus Finch was his favorite role among many such as Frank Savage in Twelve O'Clock High and Phil Green in Gentleman's Agreement. Peck was the perfect choice to play Finch and received an Academy Award for best actor for that performance. Finch is the central character in Harper Lee's autobiographical novel. A widower with two young children, he supports himself and his family as an attorney in a small town in Alabama during the Great Depression. When Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) is accused of rape, Finch agrees to represent the young black man. This decision antagonizes several of the town's racist whites.
The action is seen through Lee's persona, ""Scout"" (Mary Badham), the younger of the two Finch children. The trial becomes the focal point of the narrative, with the courtroom becoming Finch's pulpit. His eloquent appeals for justice and racial tolerance are directed to everyone in the town, not only to members of the jury. As directed by Robert Mulligan, all members of the cast perform brilliantly. Of special interest is the screen debut of Robert Duvall as Boo Radley, a mysterious recluse who eventually becomes significantly involved in the plot. Thanks to Peck's skills under Mulligan's direction, this is not a ""preachy"" film. Finch is as credible to those who see this film as he is to those in the town in which he and his children live. When making word associations with the name Gregory Peck, intelligence, integrity, and dignity immediately come to mind. All three describe Finch. Credit must also be given to Horton Foote who wrote the highly literate screenplay based on Lee's autobiographical novel. This is a great film primarily because it contains a great performance by Peck and because (through Finch) it makes a power appeal to the best that is within us, whatever the color of our skin may be.",1058832000,6,1877,4.961904761904762

52962,5,0783225857,"'To Kill a Mockingbird' the only written Pulitzer Prize classic by Harper Lee to gain so much in literary or film history. It has become not only a tale of a single father's love for his two children but a social commentary of socialism, racism and injustice. Director Robert Mulligan delivers Lee's classic with such precision that the book translation into the film reatined it's quality with nothing lost. What other films taken from books can say that? It has made the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of top 100 films of all time. It's considered one of the finest examples of family drama ever made. Even though set in a 1932 Depression-era Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, in history it still remains timeless. It's message still remains powerfully strong and resounding in our American society today. It still defends the cause of tolerance, justice, sound morals and responsible, loving single parenthood.

This message is just as very much important today as it was then. I recommend this to people of all ages. The courtroom drama is beyond mundane or formality. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two. This is one of his best performances that got him the Oscar at the Academy Awards in 1962. He takes on with compassion the defense of a black man (Brock Peters) accused of rape and murder of a young white woman. His children Scout (Mary Badham) who tells the story and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) learn about racial prejudice and hatred. They also overcome their fear of a mysterious, obscure and silent neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant screen debut). Some of the best classic lines from the movie when Atticus has a quiet moment with his children. If you just learn a single trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. And he tells them about it was a sin to kill a mockingbird. The mockingbird was different from all the other birds...because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncrib, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us.

What comes from this beautifully told film is a shining, intense drama that cleverly extracts the ideas of Harper Lee's heartfelt classic, a tremendously talented group of American actors brought together in one film and the magic of devoted artistry of screenplay and an outstanding score. It's strength has survived all the madness and complexity of today's so-called Hollywood cinema.

At least those of us lucky enough to have experienced the budding greatness of the 1962 film ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" There was a time, believe it or not, when director Robert Mulligan's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was considered trite and conventional.
Many critics claimed Gregory Peck's Academy Award-winning honor for this film to be an acknowledgement of a long and fruitful career, rather than the individual performance. Unfortunately, this film was released during a time in American history when cultural change was on the horizon. The messages in this film, based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, were no longer considered relevant. They were lost in a sea of grainy TV footage showing Kennedy's assassination, the Vietnam war and Jimi Hendrix performing ""The Star Spangled Banner.""
So I suppose it's not a surprise that ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" fell through the cracks. What a joy to see this film's reputation grow on an annual basis. Is there a single American film in history more deserving of lofty status than ""To Kill A Mockingbird?"" I say completely, without a moment's hestitation, that Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch is one of the greatest single performances in cinema history. It ranks with George C. Scott's performance in ""Patton,"" Robert De Niro's in ""The Raging Bull"" and Marlon Brando's in ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""
Rarely has a role fit an actor so comfortably and believably as that of Atticus Finch with Gregory Peck. The moment arrived, the cosmos came together, and Peck gave the ultimate performance of a lifetime. It was a role which would forever define a man, if not a country. Today, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is required viewing for all children. In fact, it should be required viewing for all Americans. This film ultimately personifies all that is strong and decent within our troubled culture.
There are really no villains in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" but there are deeply flawed men, women and children struggling with the changing tide of a complex society. In ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" this is our world, for better or for worse. Gregory Peck/Atticus Finch will eventually serve as a beacon for us all. His portrayal is a testament. It is an example of what we can truly be if we tap the best within mankind. There is not a single bad note in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" and a special note must be made for the heartbreaking performance of Brock Peters.
I suppose it is telling that when watching this film as a child, I wanted to be like Atticus Finch - wrinkled white suit, gentle smile, respectful of tradition. One day, when my children watch this film, I have not a doubt they will feel the same way. This film, like the book, is exquistely timeless.

The acting is superb (both Peck and the children) and the black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous.  Add to that the screenplay adapted from Lee's great novel, Bernstein's evocative score, and thoughtful directing, and it is easy to see why this is considered a timeless classic.
There are those who read the book and watch the film, expecting to see a movie that is an accurate incarnation of the book, and are dissapointed.  Personally, I cannot understand this.  For the film portrays the book almost perfectly--both the events and the theme and heart of the story.  It is ridiculous to debate which work is better--they are both masterpieces of their own mediums.  Thus, it is important to look at the film without the book in mind, and if you can do this, you will undoubtedly be impressed by the beautiful film.
The DVD is, for the most part, quite good.  I would support an effort at Universal to make a limited edition 2-DVD set to honor this wonderful film, but as it now stands, I am perfectly happy.

He handles a difficult situation with the utmost level of professionalism.  He deals with racial hatred while teaching his two children that the world in which we live is filled with many types of hatred.  The lesson that he teaches is relived with every challenge that Atticus faces.  The strength Atticus shows us in dealing with the community and retaining the friendship of a wrongfully accused man is tremendous.  I would recommend this movie for families to watch as a family.  There is a strong message that we all can learn from on how to better deal with racial hatred.",1055635200,,728,4.784

Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is one of the greatest cinematic characters of all-time!  He had what many of today's Hollywood actors sorely lack - INTEGRITY, MORALITY, CHARACTER and HONOR!  If you don't own any other movie in your DVD collection, YOU NEED TO GET THIS ONE!!!",1055462400,2,444,4.594936708860759
52968,5,0783225857,"We watched this DVD once again, but on a note of sadness.
We mourn Gregory Peck's passing, June 12, 2003.
Look no further than this film for the full measure of his talent, and a good glimpse at the kind of man he was in real life. It is fitting that he lived just long enough to know of the honor bestowed on his character Atticus Finch, named Greatest Hero in film by the American Film Institute .  While mortal in life, he is immortal in film. So long, Greg!
This DVD treats this classic film very well indeed, though some will always want for more extra features.  The picture is beautiful, the sound is good, the ""making-of"" retrospective is wonderful -- a must for your film library!  I'm not sure why they put colorized stills on the DVD box cover; it is a black and white film, but please don't let that stop you!
I have always thought this film deserved a better place on AFI's list of top films than #34, such as the top 10. It is as fine a two-hour distillation of Harper Lee's great American novel as you could ever ask for -- a beautiful, elegant film that exactly captures the spirit and essence of time and place and character. Fabulous direction, photography, editing, writing, acting, and music come together seamlessly in a perfect, tight fabric. It is an astounding achievement in screenplay based on such a novel.  Of course the novel is far better, more complete, but it is a great film on its own merits.
Harper Lee shows us the beauty and contradictions and ugliness in Southern culture as no one has before or since. She shows us her disappointment in and revulsion of aspects of her white Southern heritage, while at the same time showing us her great pride in a culture that is so rich and so beautiful when it throws off the ugly cloak of hatred and discrimination (take note, all ye ""proud"" wavers of the Confederate battle flag). Human arrogance and selfishness have wrought such evils, in this case from slavery to civil war to the desire for vengeance and scapegoats, often (and still) in the name of God. Let us learn from our history, improve ourselves, and sin no more.
Buy this film, watch this film, love this film.  Be Atticus Finch!",1055376000,2,2170,4.49746192893401
52979,5,0783225857,"This film ruined me for all time.
  I first saw it as a child and 'Atticus Finch' set the bar so high as to what it meant to truly be a man that I don't think any living person will ever be able to match it.
  Humility, honor, dignity, truth, integrity, justice, compassion, bravery and love. Gregory Peck's remarkable portrayal personified all those characteristics in a way that we are not likely to ever witness again.
  The scene in the courtroom after Atticus' closing arguments when the 'balcony people' all rise and Scout is told to stand because 'You're father is passing', will never fail to move me to tears.
  Every moment of this film is executed with complete integrity and every actor, most remarkably the children, is to be commended. This has to be seen to be believed. Without ever being preachy, all parties involved have made one of the most outstanding arguments ever committed to celluloid against racial hatred and prejudice. It is easy to see why so many attorneys will tell you that this film made them take up law.
  I am writing this on the day of Gregory Peck's passing and I want to send a heartfelt 'Thank You', out to the universe or heaven as the case may be, to the man who cared enough to give such a perfect rendition of all that is good that it was deservedly ranked as number one on AFI's list of 'The Top 50 Most Heroic' screen characters.

52980,5,0783225857,"In a twist of time and fate I was viewing 'To Kill A Mockingbird' on DVD when AFI released their choice of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Lee Harper's character Atticus Finch, the Southern lawyer who defends a black man unjustly accused of rape, as Hollywood's all-time movie hero.  No character in film history has more deserved to be designated as the best 'good guy'. Peck garnered a well-deserved Oscar for his role as a man of understated wisdom and quiet courage and the quintessential father-figure all men should aspire to be and all children long for in their lives.  The fact that this film, it's participants, and the basic story are still being honored after 40+ years is a testament to the solid message if offered and the effective manner in which it was presented.
I read this Pulitzer Prize novel when it was published and saw the film upon its theatrical release.  The memory of both have long lingered.  Enough can't be said about the wisdom of Universal's decision to release this Collector's Edition DVD. The public owes them a monumental 'thank-you'. Interviews with Gregory Peck and commentary by director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula make us privy to their precious memories surrounding how the charming novel was transformed into the perfect film.  Seeing Mary Badham (Scout) and Philip Alford (Jem) (non-professional southern children starring in an Oscar-nominated film) as adults offering insights into their unique experiences was an unbelievable treat.  To watch Robert Duvall make his screen debut as 'Boo Radley', and what a debut that was; and to hear his comments nearly a half-century later proves as never before the value of the DVD format and special features.
Watching this film upon its release it was inconceivable that we could one day far in the future hear and see the inside story of its making in the comfort of our homes and from the mouths of the individuals so instrumental in the process of creating a legend.
This DVD is priceless. The details of the making of this time-honored film have now been documented forever in a piece of movie-history that deserves to be savored by any true movie-buff as well as by a generation not yet born at the time of it's release.  The message and the method of communicating it are timeless and dear.  Please do yourself the honor of viewing this film.",1054857600,38,2349,4.855

Although Peter O' Toole lost the best actor oscar ---as Lawerance (Lawerance of Arabia) another amazing performance--- to Gregory Peck,, I don't think anybody would disagree that the oscar was given to the deserving...

52983,5,0783225857,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a classic, a masterpiece, and it is Gregory Peck at his prime. Peck, in his Oscar-winning role, is Atticus Finch, a widowed Southern lawyer, who defends Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a black man, who was accused of raping a white woman in Alabama, in the 1930s. At home, he raises his son, Jem (Philip Alford), and his daughter, Scout (Mary Badham, Oscar-nominated), and teaches them about compassion and the evils of prejudice. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is the second best movie of 1962, next to ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and one of the best and most important movies of the 1960s. If you have not seen this movie, rent it, or buy it on DVD (which is what I own on) or video, to add it to your collection. Read the book, too.",1050105600,2,746,4.452554744525547
52984,5,0783225857,"Gregory Peck was entirely deserving of the recognition that he got for playing Atticus Finch (including the Oscar for Best Actor), the strongest role in the movie was actually that of Scout (played by Mary Badham).  Badham was nominated for an Academy Award, and I feel that it is on the strength of Scout that this movie was carried.  While Peck may have been the moral backbone of the movie, it is Badham that is the heart of the movie and whom the film truly does revolve around.
To Kill a Mockingbird is the film adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same title.  The story deals with racism and morality in a very humanistic way.  When a black man is accused of raping a white woman, Atticus Finch takes the case to defend Tom Robinson (the man accused).  This is a story about race relations as well as community relations and in the end, about doing the right thing.  The house next to the Finch home is the Radley house.  There are stories and rumors and prejudices against the hidden Radley boy, Boo Radley (the screen debut of Robert Duvall).  Somehow, the stories about the Radley home come together with the trial of Tom Robinson and the moment where Scout gently says, ""hey Boo"" is truly a beautiful moment.
I could probably heap praise on this movie until my fingers can't type anymore, but I am simply going to end by saying this is a movie than anybody who wants to watch a great movie needs to see this.  Both the book and the movie are truly American classics.",1048723200,4,1503,4.476190476190476

The movie carries all of the impact of the book, with a perfect cast bringing to life the familiar characters.  Scout, Atticus Finch and Boo Radley all come to life in crisp black and white.
Challenging subject matter in it's time, the themes are still valid today.  Rape, racism...not easy topics to discuss especially for kids, but they are facts of the world and should be confronted.  This movie, and the book it comes from, help ease the transition.
The DVD is excellent, and a great presentation for this fine film.  Definitely one for the ages.  A movie every child should see.",1048723200,4,685,4.714285714285714
52986,5,0783225857,"Robert Mulligan hardly directed any films of note, which is what makes To Kill a Mockingbird such a pleasant surprise. It is a stunning film, a fable of fear and prejudice told with striking visual flair. The haunting shadows and eerie hues of Russell Harlan's camerawork evoke the myths and nocturnal fears of childhood, and Elmer Bernstein's quintessentially American score supplements the imagery well, creating a film laden with atmosphere.
Harper Lee's story follows a lawyer (Atticus Finch) who puts himself on the line to defend a black man accused of rape in the 1930s deep south, told through the eyes of his two children, who are on a journey of their own to overcome some lesser prejudices of their own. The young Mary Badham and Philip Alford give excellent performances.
The subject matter is bold for the time, and there is little evidence of the kind of bowdlerization that plagued many other films of the same, and an earlier, era. The heart of the film is very simple: It wants very earnestly to show us that prejudice and bigotry are nothing but those childhood fears, borne of ignorance, and resolved by those brave enough to step beyond the barriers, confronting their fears, and, in so doing, finding that differences are nothing to be scared of.",1048377600,2,1267,4.87037037037037
52987,5,0783225857,"Everyone who has ever taken high school English classes will no doubt be familiar with Harper Lee's time honored story. As is mentioned in the accompanying DVD, Fearfull Symmetry, it is second only to the Bible in the hearts and minds of U.S. readers. This is probably also the most often-shown film in said classrooms. No need to reshash the story-line, then.
  This DVD set offers an excellent transfer of the famed black and white cinematography of the prolific Russel Harlan. It's a real treat to hear from so many of the people who were involved in the production, from the producer, Alan J. Pakula, to the now grown actors who played Scout and Jim. The audience gains great insights into what made this film so special, not only to the legions of its admiring fans, but to everyone involved in creating it. We learn the scenes that Horton Foote, the screenwriter added from the book to advance character development (the scene showing Atticus putting Scout to bed and her questioning Jim about their mother as Atticus overhears them from the porch, was not in the book, for instance). We get to hear from Elmer Bernstein talk about the genesis of his unforgettable soundtrack. Due credit is also given to Stephen Frankfurt, for his highly creative and original title design, which sets the tone so beatifully for the rest of the film.
  There is no question that this is director Robert Mulligan's greatest film, nor that in his portrayal of Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck found the role most perfectly suited to his character and rock-solid persona. This is a film about integrity, essentially, and there is not a false moment in the film. This compilation should be included in any film collector's library. I hope it continues to be shown in English classes until time immemorial. It's message and its relevance to the human condition will never go out of style, one hopes.

I read the book and watch the movie at least once a year and I still love it.  The characterizations were perfectly done in the book and very well imitated in the movie.  Gregory Peck makes the perfect Atticus and you are amazed at how well the children played the parts.  You'll laugh as the children try to figure out how to get reclusive ""Boo"" Radley out of his house (leave a trail of lemon drops and he'll follow it, eating them) or get a message in to him (put a note on the end of a fishing pole).  Yet you find yourself crying when you realize how much he must have loved them and tried to protect them.

""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is also a simple social commentary on racism, wonderfully and innocently seen through a child's eyes, and man's rejection of others he doesn't understand. The commentary, 40 years old now, remains as relevant as then. As southern lawyer Atticus Finch, Peck garnered a Best Actor Oscar for his powerfully moving performance that, as one scene elicits, also commands a deep respect of the screen character. As defense counsel for an African-American (a contemporary poltically correct term; then, they were ""coloreds"") man falsely accused of raping a white woman (not popular in the south), Peck evokes a sense of outrage at the injustice of his client's position. The genius of the film, though, is its perspective of Peck's screen daughter, Scout. And it is her innocent confusion in not understanding why her father becomes chastised by the white community that hopefully gets across the sublimial message that there is no understanding of any form of discrimination. Ranked the 34th best film ever by the American Film Institute, this one will remain always relevant as long as injustice based on discrimination exists.

I identified with Jem and Scout and Dill and wished I could go with them on the heart-stopping excursions to Boo's house; I felt the broad spectrum of emotion that this classic evokes in me to this day, and when it was brought to the screen, there was nothing missing; it is a complete, intact translation into cinema and is, in my opinion, the best performance of Gregory Peck's career. I hated Mayella Ewell for a long time, until I realized what her life was truly like and the real villain here is her father. I felt so bad for Brock Peters, and I felt his hopelessness so keenly, it was hard to watch, much harder than it was to read, and the pain and resignation on his face still conjures up all the hate crimes that continue to this day, and reminds me, uncomfortably, of the truck dragging death in Texas. The setting is wonderful, the gifts in the tree from Boo are touching, and the feeling of sorrow when Mr. Radley fills up the hole is profound. Dill, the character drawn directly from Truman Capote, is one of my favorite characters, the old-young wisdom and mature vocabulary are a joy to watch. Calpurnia is solid and comforting in the fast-changing world of the Finch household, and you are glad she is there. The court-room scene is riveting, as is the byplay in the balcony, where Jem, Dill and Scout sneak in and watch the proceedings. The Reverend, when the trial is over, cautions the children to ""Stand up, your father is passing.."" so thankful is he that Atticus, although losing the case, has nevertheless made a strong statement by virtue of the fact that he kept the jury out so long...and of course, the end, when the children are attacked on their way home from a Halloween party at the school by none other than Tom Ewell. Boo saves their lives, and when Atticus agrees with the Sheriff to let it be, and leave Boo alone, Scout says, ""I understand...it would be like killing a mockingbird.""

Reading Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel had a huge impact on me as a teenager...I never forgot, as Atticus says to Scout, that you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.
Horton Foote won an Oscar for his screenplay, which is so faithful to the book. Set in depression era Alabama, it's seen through the eyes of 8 year old Scout, beautifully played by Mary Badham, and the sensitivity of director Mulligan's vision is remarkable.
Prejudice is the theme that runs through the story, from the harrowing court case of Tom (an amazing performance by Brock Peters), falsely accused of rape, to the demonization of Boo  (played by Robert Duvall, in his screen debut...he's intensely moving as this innocent and silent man).
Russell Harlan's superb cinematography should be seen in the widescreen version to be fully appreciated, and Elmer Bernstein's Americana style score adds so much to the film.

The three children are wonderfully natural, as are the other actors, but the real stars are the novel itself, Horton Foote's screenplay, Robert Mulligan's direction, and Elmer Bernstein's haunting score.

Has there ever been a more effective scene than when at the end of the trial the Black minister turns to Scout and says ""Miss Jean Louise, stand up, your father is passing""? Or a better ending? Or a better object lesson about race and class? I don't think so. Citizen Kane may be a better movie, from a technical sense, but for me, I have never been more affected by a film emotionally than by To Kill a Mockingbird. After 40 years the film has lost none of its power.

Harper Lee was able to capture those magical and enchanted feelings that accompany nostalgic reminiscence of ones childhood, and the creators of this wonderful film manage to adapt this to the screen with elegance and brilliance. On top of that, it is accompanied by a great score by Elmer Bernstein and some fantastic acting, most notably by Gregory Peck who was exactly how I had pictured Atticus and portrays his dignity and virtue exquisitely. The DVD also has some really worthwhile bonus features, with some interesting interviews with the cast (including the now adult Scout and Gem) and creators.

53042,5,0783225857,"To Kill A Mockingbird is arguably one of the greatest American films ever. You will never be dissapointed. However, do not waste your time with the commentary. I have bought some lousy DVD's (ex.""Idle Hands"") just for the joy of the inventive commentary. This is a classic with a horrible commentary. Director Robert Mulligan gives some good insight when he is allowed to speak. On the other hand Producer Alan Pakula (whose work I have always admired)unfortunately monopolizes the conversation, should have left the matter in Mulligan's hands and stayed out. His comments are interminably redundant: he must mentioned the key being the kid's point of view 800 times (have you no other thing to offer?), constant stroking of Mulligan whom he refers to monotonously in the third person (""Bob"" does this or that)even though they are sitting beside one another, and frequently whispers his comments to Mulligan so as not to include the audience (perhaps a blessing, but annoying in its exclusion). One of the most aggravating issues is slighting the actors (except the kids and Peck), not introducing them or talking much about them and ignoring some amazing choices (chief among being Collin Wilcox just barely not touching the Bible as she prepares to testify and lie - brilliant or didn't they notice?). Buy the movie. Ignore the disservice they do to their own work by talking about it.",1011484800,3,1387,5.008658008658009
53043,5,0783225857,"Just one glance at Robert J. Mulligan's 1962 film and you will see why it (unlike many of today's contenders) is a true American masterpiece.
Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, this film narrates the realities of growing up in the south during the depression while watching her father defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.
The difficult subjects of racism and the legal system are addressed in a timeless response that does not fade despite comparatively more advanced filming techniques or altering legal realities.
As the Anglo protagonist Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck delivers one of the most excellent character performances of his film career. His task in the throes of segregation is a gloomy prospect (with judges and jurors predisposed to bias against your client from day one) but Finch trudges stoically on throughout the screenplay.
This imparts to his children the importance of standing up for what you believe in and being an open minded person that tries to treat everybody fairly. Certainly the family faces retribution from narrow-minded community members, but the children learn those attacks are a small price to pay for the greater good of a society without bias and injustice. It is better to place yourself on the line for your principles than to say/do nothing and let things continue as they had always occurred.
That in itself would be a powerful statement for a film produced during resurrection of the American civil rights movement, but it also tackles the biases surrounding people with disabilities in the character of Boo Radley.
As the town ""idiot"", he is an enigma to the local children--who spend a considerable amount of time in the film fascinated by the rumors surrounding this man---until he becomes the one who saves Scout from vicious attack related to her father's case.  Like Jim, he represents the ""Mockingbird""-entities who do not harm anything else and therefore should be treated with kindness.
Finally, Scout's proto-feminism in wondering why she would be treated differently than her younger brother foreshadows the resurrection of the feminist movement in America. Despite Atticus's comparatively progressive stance on race issues, he unwittingly bought into sexist assumptions about gender roles.",1011484800,5,2270,5.202185792349726
53044,5,0783225857,"It started with the gift of Harper Lee's magical book, a gift to literature., indeed. Then came the movie, a gift to cinema that withstands the test of time.
Just look at the opening credits, quite possibly one of the most ingenious and modern looking segments in cinema over the last forty years. It's simplicity absolutely captures the film, while setting the magical mystery on its course, the world of children in a box.
Then move on to Gregory Peck's most moving, strong, amazing performance; it's quite possibly the perfect match with role, actor, screenplay. His dignity shines through a dignified role.
And then there are the kids, two unknowns, who do their best acting by just being themselves. Mary Badham is absolutely charming and stunning in her innocent portrayal of a terribly difficult role.
But what shines most is the story... the story of a black man unjustly accused of a hideous act, the story of a spooky man who lives a life of hiding, ultimately, how we judge others is how we are judged.
And that is the lasting gift of this movie, and this DVD.

53045,5,0783225857,"I loved this DVD and movie in general. I loved the book when they made us read it about in Middle School. Since it's been ages since I've seen or read either I needed to get this video and I recieved it as a wonderful gift for Christmas. Though, it took me a while to watch it. When I did watch it however, it really does make you think back to those times. And some things I didn't even catch when I was younger that I do as an adult. The story is told by a grown up Scout who was rather a Tom Boy. Her and her brother growing up with their father who's a lawyer. The story intellengently touches on perhapes three stories in one. One story is of the family in general, the second one is the story of the kids wanting to know about their neighbor Boo Bradley. The third and most thought provoking and sometimes hard to watch because of it being so dramatic is where the father defends a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. That scene in general was outstanding. It's easy to see that Gregory Peck won an academy award for best actor. The movie makes you want to read the book, which does give more detail. However, the great thing about this movie is not for the actor's but the fact that it really does follow the book.
As for the DVD it's self it was a pleasure to navigate around. Has a wonderful information on production notes. And the idea of an author (Harper Lee) loving a Screen Play is quite unknown so that just tells you how much this movie is loved. The only thing is that the sound was rather hard to hear, however I haven't been able to find a DVD or Video yet that had good sound with this movie. It's still worth the buy you won't be sorry, the picture is great for a black and white film and it's fun re-watching a child's adventure in the times of a depression. I recommend this movie for anyone who's old enough to understand this film, and I garentee after you watch the movie you'll want to read the book. I wanted to re-read the book after I saw the movie again :)",1010534400,3,2002,4.135897435897436
53046,5,0783225857,"This film has such an evocative title sequence we're amazed to learn that Saul Bass didn't do it. It almost threatens to overpower the film, as the Bass titles for ""A Walk on the Wild Side"" primed us for something that film did not deliver. ""Mockingbird"" begins delivering in narrative, performance and craftsmanship soon enough, and it does so in beautiful black-and-white cinematography stunningly restored in this DVD transfer.

It also delivers a small emotional wallop following the black man's rape trial, when his white attorney (Gregory Peck) leaves a courtroom in defeat and empty save for the blacks packed into the upper gallery. As they rise to their feet, one says to the little girl beside him, ""Stand up, child, your father's leaving the coutroom.""

53058,5,0783225857,"From the moment the film begins, with its stunning slow-motion opening and one of the best film scores I have ever heard, you know that this will be a film to remember for many years.  It is a coming of age story about children learning the ways of the adult world (both good and bad), and also learning about the honor and faith their father, lawyer Atticus Finch, has in the justice system, demonstrated by his villigent defense of his current client, a young black man wrongly accused of rape.  It's also a moral and humanitarian story about making an effort to dissuade misconceptions about race and ""family values.""  Lastly, and in a smaller form, it is a film about redemption.  What you think you know about someone can change dramatically when they do something seemingly out of the ordinary...like saving your life.  Atticus Finch tells his daughter that ""you never know what a person is really like until you take a moment to step in their shoes for a little while.""  It's pretty simple, but powerful stuff.
What I think is really distinct about this film is that the children's characterizations are treated with such sensitivity.  It could become easy to treat the daily nuances of a child's imagination and naivite as something silly or unimportant.  Their characters are aided by fantastic performances by the young actors, Mary Badham and Philip Adford.  Gregory Peck gives one of the most memorable performances I can imagine.  His portrayal is understated and touching, eventually leading up to his character's fierce determination in the final courtroom scene, where he lays out the injustices that have plagued his client.  It's one of the finest courtroom scenes in American film history, encapsulating both the strength of what the justice system of America represents and also portraying the fervent racial tensions that were dividing the nation at the time of the film's release (1962).
And it all works tremendously well.  Some of the most poignant moments in the film were so subtle.  The part where I lost it was when, after Finch was handed a defeat by the jurors, he slowly starts gathering up his paperwork as the courtroom floor empties.  But the second floor (of black townspeople-in awe of his defense) stand and watch as he gets ready to leave.  Reverend Sykes quietly tells Atticus' son Jem to stand up, in a way to hommage the man who stood up for his own beliefs and the defense of not just a single man accused, but a whole community.  It was a really sensitive visual statement that conveyed a powerful sentiment about the perpetual state of race in America.  And I was crying big-time!  And the final scene, in which we find out the true personality of Boo Radley, was really suprising and touching.  It really makes you think about the how extraordinary the human spirit can be, and how making snap judgements about other people really doesn't pay off in the end.
I just saw the film for the first time tonight, and it is now one of my all time favorites.  And now for the book....",1002585600,6,3021,4.75095785440613

53060,5,0783225857,"The art of story telling is rare in film today.  Without a car case or a gun battle, what is the point of making a movie?  But on a rare occasion a timeless film is made that sets the mark of excellence.  To Kill A Mockingbird is one of those films.
Filmed in Black and White, although color was available then, the film captures the sleepy town of Macomb where tree lined dirt roads prevail, neighbors know one another and check in on each other, and the only thing a kid has to entertain himself is the endless miles of fields and a vivid imagination.
The task of transforming the Harper Lee novel into film is not easy.  How does a writer take a Pulitzer Prize novel and boil it down to a slick 120 minute story.  With just a few exceptions the whole of this novel is kept and is well presented in the film.
Gregory Peck in the lead role of Atticus Finch was key.  But Peck presence is only the glue that holds the film together.  The true triumph of this film is in the casting of Mary Badham and Phillip Alford as the lead characters of  Scout and Jem.  The selection of two unknowns from Birmingham, Alabama made this film.  The naivt'e of the children is apparent and beliveable and gives the film the sense of innocense lost as Jem and Scout learn that the world is not a fair place.

There are, of course, the requisite bios and production notes, but the running commentary and feature-length documentary are what make this worth spending the money.
The commentary is by director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula, and offers many insights into making the film. There are a couple of drawbacks to this commentary, one of which is Pakula talks very softly at times, making him difficult to understand. Another minor drawback is that when not offering great information, Pakula and Mulligan are often complimenting each other and all involved on what a great job they did on the film. This is not really a bad thing, as it's almost as if they can't believe that it came out as well as it did.
The documentary, ""Fearful Symmetry,"" appears to be made especially for this DVD. It of course covers some of the same ground as the commentary, since Mulligan and Pakula are both interviewed, but it is a delight to see and hear from Gregory Peck, Phillip Alford (Jem), Mary Badham (Scout), Robert Duvall, Brock Peters and others. Alford and Badham spin great tales about their experiences making the film and appear to have no regrets.

53064,5,0783225857,"I can't write about Harper Lee's novel, the Pulitzer Prize, the Ocsar nominations from this film, or any of the other big worded babble I see in many other reviews. I can only write about my own simple feelings, so here goes:
I first saw TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD along about 1975 on late night TV. I was about twelve years old at the time. My parents had just bought a farm in the country and they spent a lot of time there. I was allowed to stay home in the city alone. Well, sort of alone, my grandmother lived right next door and kept a watchful eye over me. Never the less, this was my chance to watch the old movies they played on late night TV.
I was completely into this movie. I couldn't get up from the floor where I was sitting in front of the television set. No small feat to accomplish with a twelve year old boy. At the time, I was only a couple of years older than the character Gem, Atticus Finch's ten year old son. This movie, on this night in 1975, changed my view of life forever.
My father, born and raised in the time this film occurs, was very opinionated of those who were of a different race. He had no use for violent racism whatsoever, but Atticus Finch he wasn't either. While I loved my father dearly, this film helped me understand that he wasn't always right. The film also made me understand that remarks and opinions weren't always just about race. Sometimes, as with Boo Radley, they were about the people down the street, be they different in any way. My father was guilty of this sin too. Again, I learned that all of his opinions did not have to become mine.
White, Black, Comfortable, Poor, Smart, Slow, Good, Evil, Fun, Serious, Laughter, Fear. All the elements are here, as seen through the eyes of children. Sometimes, we know not what we do to our children because of the way they see things. This film awakens us to that fact. All of these lessons taught in a film of kids having fun. Oh man, I wish they still made tires big enough to ride inside of.
Crayons, marbles, pocket watches, oh the simplicity of what is fun in children's eyes. Despite our present day culture of buying loads of manufactured toys and games, most young children would just as soon throw out the toys and play with the boxes. Mason jars, hot summer evenings, and fireflies are also more fun than any amount of money can buy.
I had spent years looking for a VHS copy of this movie, and finally found this version....I went and purchased the Wide Screen Edition immediately. I find myself popping this in, late at night, and reliving the experience I had at twelve. It happens every time, I have to stop whatever else I may be doing and watch attentively.
  I play this for my six year old son every chance I get. I too, think that this is required viewing for children six through twelve. I really believe he'll learn something about life, and will have fun doing it. It also gives me ideas, like finding the largest motorcycle tire I could find and tying it up with rope to our maple tree in the front yard, making a swing out of it. And despite what my neighbors may think, believing it right to do so. How about going to a yardsale and buying an old scratched up toy car for less than a buck and placing it in a tree knothole for him to find. There is no way to measure the level of excitement, and that scratched up old toy car becomes his favorite toy. Even Christmas can't compare, because he knows it's comming.
Repeated viewings of this film makes me a better father. It makes me remember to think like a six year old again. So what if the boys create a dirt figure 8 track for their toy cars right in the front yard. If the neighbors don't like it, maybe they should move. Or better yet, maybe I should loan them my copy of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.",994464000,5,3769,4.292134831460674
53065,5,0783225857,"Certain films define not only their particular genre, but also their country. For me, as a Canadian, this film has always embodied the best and worst of what exemplifies southern American culture. It deals with children, with racial issues, with the persistent matter of ""differentness"" that lies at the heart of every person's most significant issues. To be ""different"" is to be isolated; it's an issue that embraces personality, ethnicity, skin color, economic level--everything, really. And this film deals with that matter on several levels. It is, to my mind Gregory Peck's more memorable performance, embodying as he does the ideals by which we can only try to live. And it was Robert Duvall's debut film performance as the spooky, seldom-seen, but everpresent Boo Radley.

One thing on which we all agreed was that the movie is a gem. My son also noted the following:
After our book dissusion, we saw the movie To Kill a Mockingbird. Through it, I learned that moviemakers condense characters so they don't have to introduce a large cast. For example, in the novel, Dill's aunt is actually Mrs. Rachel, but in the movie, the characters of  Mrs. Stephanie and Mrs. Rachel are combined. The Finch's large extended family is missing from the film, as are Scout's teachers and classmates. I also learned that a filmmaker may also have a different vision of a book's characters. My mental picture of the characters included Scout as a small girl with freckles and pigtails and Calpurnia as a pudgy old woman in glasses. The actors who portrayed them in the film differed greatly from what I imagined.",986083200,2,1073,4.707446808510638

This is the heart of her book, and it is the heart of this faithfully adapted film of that book.
In an age that usually draws males and females in broad caricatures, depicting brutishness and carnality as the norm, and crassness and ""in-your-face"" as the only form of honesty, the characters in Mockingbird are not only refreshing, they are a revelation.
The book and the film is largely about decency.  Simple human decency.  The characters in this story of childhood adventures, awakenings and surprises, with the trial of an innocent black man in the South of the 30's at its center, are by and large decent people.
  From Scout's father, Atticus, sincerely defending the man, to the Judge wanting a fair trial and result, to the defendant Tom and his family, to Cal the housekeeper, to the lady next door, to the Reverend, to the simple and plain but honest Sheriff, and even the farmer momentarily caught up in the lynch mob mentality....all are essentially decent people struggling within their society's preconceived assumptions and intolerances to do what's right. And, of course, there is Boo.
Yes, the world has its share of ignorant, cowardly, and hate-filled Bob Ewells.  But, they do not define the world, so long as there are good men and women striving to do the right thing.
This flawlessly cast movie is a masterpiece.  It captures the innocense and wonder of childhood, and the sometimes tragedy & struggle of adulthood without preaching. The performances are first rate down to the smallest role.  Robert Mulligan manages to capture the world from a child's perspective without belaboring it.
The world has spun around a few times since I saw this movie on it's release when I was little more than a child myself.  It captured and moved me then.  It moves me now.  It's simple truths and humanity are timeless.",985996800,5,2222,4.785340314136126
53096,5,0783225857,"Like so many teachers, I've used the VHS version of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" to teach the Elements of Literature to high school students.
Today, the internet has a wealth of resources to assist teachers and students using this classic adaptation of Harper Lee's novel.  The documentary, ""Fearful Symmetry"" produced in 1998 to be included on this DVD Collector's Edition, is great resource for teachers, students and all those who love and have been touched by ""Mockingbird.""
The 130 minute documentary, written and directed Charles Kiselyak, both discusses how the film was made and it's general literary elements.  The film is one of the most effectively edited documentaries I have seen, linking key scenes from ""Mockingbird"" with talking heads, still photos and black and white film taken in various localities across the south.
The documentary narration, written by Charles Kiselyak and read with great emotion by Mary Williams, is literary and quite  sophisticated.
The talking heads include: screenwriter Horton Foote, director Robert Mulligan, producer Allan J. Pakula and composer Elmer Bernstein.  Members of the cast appearing in the film: Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch), Phillip Alford (Jem), Mary Badham (Scout), Collin Wilcox (Maybella Ewell), Brock Peters (Tom Robinson) and Robert Duvall (Boo Radley).
Director Charles Kiselyak with the help of Harper Lee was able to get three residents to discuss their lives in Monroeville, Alabama.  A.B. Blass and Norman Barnett recall life in the small town during the depression, and Ida Gaillard, a retired high school teacher, brings an interesting perspective to what life was (may have been) like in the town Harper Lee used as the model for Maycomb.
The literary and social significance of the ""Mockingbird"" are discussed by black attorney, Cleophis Thomas, Jr., and Claudia Durst Johnson, author of ""Threatening Boundries.""
In the DVD's printed supplement, Charles Kiselyak indicates that while Harper Lee was not willing to appear in the documentary, she was very helpful in the production.  She was thrilled with the director's plan to open the documentary with the first verse one of her favorite poems, William Blake's, ""Tyger:""
Tyger, Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immoral hand or eye, Could frame they fearful symmetry,
Kiselyak's film discusses Lee's novel as both a way of life and a passage from innocence into experience and then back toward innocence -- ""Fearful Symmetry.""

53097,4,0783225857,"This wonderful adaptation of Harper Lee's classic novel is a film of great dignity, a Norman Rockwell painting come to life. It effectively conveys the leisurely Southern summers and Tom Sawyerish feel of Lee's youth. Drawing parallels between the fears of children and adults, the movie shows us that we don't necessarily grow up when we reach adulthood. In the end, those of us who do mature find that there is often beauty on the other side of that mysterious door; and ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" shows us some of the possibilities.
Relying on the acting talents of several children doesn't hamper the picture's effectiveness one bit. On the contrary, it's one of the film's surprising strengths. Mary Badham as ""Scout"" and Phillip Alford as ""Jem"" are utterly convincing as the children that many of us got to know in school. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his depiction of ""Atticus Finch""; his role is portrayed with profound character, and gives one the impression of the highest integrity. Peck's closing argument to the jury is riveting, and is a stellar example of on-screen presense. There is inspiration and hope to be found here, a transcendence of time that few films can match.
The collector's edition DVD is excellent. Besides providing lovers of this work with a clean, sharp video transfer, we are treated to a beautiful ""making of"" documentary and given a decent director's commentary. Also included are several ""standard"" amenities: production notes, cast and filmmakers, language options, and a theatrical trailer. The sound quality is rather wanting, but it does the job.

The casting is perfect, Mr. Peck is the perfect person to portray  Atticus Finch and why I believed lawyers were for actually for the  innocent.

53122,5,0783225857,"I first saw this wonderful movie after rushing out to buy the novel to read before the movie finally came out later in the summer. I was just a teenager still in high school, but immediately loved the movie, which I  have seen countless times since. Gregory Peck is probably the single  greatest reason for the movie's smashing success, although the entire cast  does a terrific job in bringing this momentous story to the screen.  In  today's complex world one tends to lose perspective as to how explosive,  provocative, and sensational the issues of cross-race rape was in the early  1960s when the movie hit the screens. Yet despite the sizzling if subdued  sexual content and the divisive issues surrounding the movie, it quickly  became the movie of the year, winning Peck the Oscar for his incredible  portrayal of rural southern lawyer Atticus Finch.
No doubt it is the  character of Atticus Finch who deserves most of the credit for the novel's  enduring popularity. Seldom has such a quietly heroic figure been so  favorably and memorably described in such loving detail in an American  novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the highly principled and somewhat  befuddled widower-lawyer trying his level best to raise his two young  children alone in the midst of the deep South during the early years of the  Depression. As daughter Scout remembers, there was little that Atticus  couldn't charm or talk his way out of. And, as played by Gregory Peck,  this thoughtful, moral, and courageous man became a model of modern  American manhood for all who read or watched his story unfold. Of course,  the other characters are also lovingly and carefully drawn and described,  and the way in which the importance and relevance of the mockingbird  parable is sown into the web of the story at a number of different levels  with a number of different characters is also one of the enduring treasures  found within the pages of this book.
Whether considering Tom Robinson,  Boo Radley, Scout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we all come to better  understand the ways in which all the individuals' stories and fate are  intricately and inextricably interwoven with each other and into the fabric  of a particular time and place. Indeed, we watch with growing affection as  Atticus increasingly relies and depends on their black governess, and are  amazed by the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well. On  the other hand, we watch as Bob Ewell acts despicably to mistreat people of  color. There are volumes of wisdom herein regarding the treatment of human  beings and the problems associated with trying to live in any particular  place at any specific time. So well and accurately drawn are the characters  of this fable of the life and times of Scout Finch in ""To Kill A  Mockingbird"", that one can only hope it continues to be widely seen  and appreciated as a modern American classic.",964742400,13,2900,4.8428571428571425

Suffice it to say, there is little need to indulge in any lengthy film synopsis other than to  say that this film represents one of but a handful of times when a film  truly captures the essence and warmth of the novel on which it is based.  Though I only saw this film once as a child, its memory stuck in my mind  for a long time, and when I heard that the film had been released on DVD, I  quickly purchased a copy.  My memories did not betray me, for this is just  as enchanting and moving a film as I remembered it to be.  Furthermore, the  DVD transfer is excellent.  The picture quality is sparkling and the sound  is crystal clear.  Plus, there is a good commentary track and very in-depth  cast and bio notes.  However, the best extra is the documentary  ""Fearful Symmetry.""  Unlike most documentary nowadays, which tend  to focus on self-propaganda and promotion and special effects, this long  (practically feature-length!) documentary uses the film as a starting point  from which to discuss the background era in which the film is set; it  focuses on real people and real locales which find their parallel in the  movie.  In sort, this is quite a remarkable documentary and is, in my  opinion, the best one I've seen on any DVD by a long shot.

53136,5,0783225857,"The film, truly an American classic and, for my money, one of the 10 best American films ever made, is splendidly rendered here with a mint-condition print. The DVD also offers a superb mix of additional features, most  especially the remarkable documentary on the film, ""Fearful  Symmetry,"" by Charles Kiselyak, and compelling yet unassuming  commentary by the director, Robert Mulligan, and the producer, the late  Alan J. Pakula.
Besides interviews with Mulligan and Pakula, the  documentary includes interviews with the actors who play the children, Mary  Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem, as well as with the screen  writer, Horton Foote, and the composer, Elmer Bernstein.  The documentary  also includes interviews with several residents of Monroeville, Ala., the  real Macon, to round out a sense of  ""Macon"" then and  now.
Among the revelations in the commentary is that production designer  Henry Bumstead (Vertigo) masterfully recreated the children's neighborhood  on the Universal backlot using houses that would have been demolished by  the construction of a freeway. The main titles, by Stephen Frankfurt, with  Bernstein's theme, manage brilliantly to capture not only the essense of  the film but an essence of childhood, about which both Harper Lee's  timeless only published novel and the film itself are very much about. Only  later do we discover the nature of that blend of innocence and experience  alluded to in the William Blake poem from which Kiselyak takes the title of  his documentary.
My only regret is that Harper Lee, though she helped  Kiselyak in producing the documetnary, declined to be interviewed for it.  In its stead, however, we have another evocation, that of Ms. Lee's voice  in the rich tone of nostalgia and reminiscence with which Kiselyak infuses  his own small but mighty masterpiece.",960163200,188,1842,5.247422680412371

53153,5,0783225857,"To Kill a Mockingbird
 To Kill a Mockingbird, starring Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, Brock Peters, Robert Duvall, and James Anderson, and directed by Robert Mulligan, is a pretty faithful adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, a relative of Robert E. Lee.  It is the story of a wise and kind man, Atticus Finch (Peck) raising  a 10-year-old boy, Jem (Alford) and a 6-year-old girl, Scout (Badham) in a  small Alabama town in 1932, during the Great Depression with their friend  Dill Harris, played by John Megna.  Atticus, a lawyer, defends a black man  named Tom Robinson (Peters), accused of raping a white woman, just  as he defends his children from racism as personified by Bob Ewell  (Anderson) and from fear of the unknown, as personified by their mysterious  neighbor, Boo Radley (Duvall)  I think To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film.  It also  helps me learn what it was like back in the Great Depression.  The theme is  walking in somebody else's shoes, a figure of speech asking for tolerance.  Part of the reason I liked it was because it centered on kids.  The kids  may  have just been spectators in the balcony and victims in the woods, but  I think their body language helped show their feelings.  They looked  unhappy and tired in the balcony and scared in the woods.  I think  the acting was excellent.  The children often seemed natural to me.  I am  glad Gregory Peck earned an Academy Award, as Robert Duvall would in the  future.  I  liked and admired Atticus, especially during his closing  argument.  Boo Radley looked just like I imagined.  James Anderson was good  as a bigot, but I think his role could have been made more subtle.  Brock  Peters impressed me with his emotional acting, but I think his role, too,  could have been written to be more complex.

53155,5,0783225857,"Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan and Horton Foote have made an absolutely terrific movie of one of the greatest books in contemporary fiction.  The three years covered in the book are compressed into one year in the movie,  and almost everything of importance is kept in the film version.

Shooting the movie in black and white was inspired.  It symbolizes the stark reality of black vs. white that is at the core of the novel. The acting is extraordinary across the board.  Of Gregory Peck, so much has been said that further praise is redundant; suffice to say that after Peck's performance, no one else will ever be able to play Atticus Finch.  The children are wonderful, so real that they hardly seem to be acting at all.  Mary Badham is absolutely perfect as Scout.  Phillip Alford is excellent as Jem, and John Megna is fine as Dill.  The lesser actors live up to the lead roles.  I especially liked Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell; James Anderson brings out all the ugliness and cowardice in Bob Ewell, and Alice Ghostley is a funny and wacky Stephanie Crawford.

The three characters who didn't live up to their counterparts in the book were Miss Maudie, Calpurnia, and Tom Robinson.  Ms. Maudie is a very intriguing character in the novel, a ditzy, wise, funny woman of bedrock integrity; in the movie, she comes across as just another next door neighbor.  Calpurnia's part was far too small in the movie; in the book she plays a major role in the family, almost like a surrogate parent.  Estelle Evans is a fine actress and deserved a bigger role to give her talent more scope.  And Tom Robinson is almost too saintly to be believed in the film version, over-acted by Brock Peters.  But Robert Duvall in a non-speaking movie debut is just right as Boo Radley, and Scout's recognition of her formerly scary neighbor, with her tentative smile followed by 'Hey Boo', is one of the most affecting moments in the picture.

I still remember when Peck won the Oscar for best actor; in his acceptance speech, his first words were 'Thank you, Harper  Lee.'  The movie 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a labor of love of bringing a timeless classic to the screen, and Harper Lee must have been very gratified at the results.

53156,5,0783225857,"The new Collector's Edition dvd for Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is truly fantastic, filled with many extras like a captivating behind-the-scene documentary that is about an hour and a half long with  fascinating interviews with the wondrous actors who brought the characters  to life such as the Mary Badham(Scout),Phillip Alford(Jem), Brock  Peters(Tom), Collin Wicox(Mayella), and many more.  The audio commentary is  also particularly interesting which allows a more in-depth look at this  film adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.
After watching the  dvd, I just had to grab my copy of Lee's great book and reread it over  again.  The film is one of those rare gems which is able to capture the  true beauty and essence that the novel exudes.  Please watch this  inspirational film and read the novel which brought this film to life.  Thanks.",946166400,3,863,5.122302158273381
53157,5,0783225857,"Truman Capote's influence is felt everywhere in both the book and film versions of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, Harper Lee's classic, beautifully haunting story of childhood, innocence lost, and of the cruelty that exists  in people everywhere.  Yes, Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, and all of the  players here inhabit their roles with grace, humor and gravity, but it is  Mary Badham as Scout who steals the show, as it should be.  The simplicity  of a father's touch, of a rapist's grimace, of the wind gently blowing  through the trees at dusk -- everything in this movie evokes, from Scout's  point of view, a time we each have in our lives that transforms us into  adults.  There comes with it an aching sadness -- as if saying goodbye to a  comforting old friend -- but the revelation carries with it a profound joy.  Elmer Bernstein's score realizes each emotional chord of the film, and  transports us without ever lambasting us -- it is the best kind of movie  score.  You will be hooked from the opening credits, which are creatively  brilliant -- those crayons, the haunting and beguiling theme softly begins  on the piano -- through to the closing credits, at which point there will  be well-earned tears softly falling down your cheek.",945388800,5,1242,4.751173708920188
53158,5,0783225857,"Brilliant! The story is compelling and truly haunting. It brings to life the best and the worst of which society and individuals are capable. Atticus is an amazing character of courage, integrity and modesty. Gregory  Peck IS Atticus Finch. His portrayal is so convincing that he is exactly  the phenomenal gentleman Harper Lee wrote of.  His conviction to justice  and respect for all people is unwavering and the epitome of character we  all should possess. The movie is haunting.  I saw it first as a child and  never forgot it.  I saw it again in my teens and was overwhelmed. As an  adult I have a full appreciation for its perfection and a great admiration  for the broad spectrum of life's lessons it brought to the screen.  A must  see movie, a must read book. Be sure to do both.  You won't be  dissapointed. Bravo!",944006400,5,824,4.593103448275862
53159,5,0783225857,"""TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD"" is one of my favourite books and a favourite movie of mine. This is one of the few books I read where I really felt that I knew the characters; it was as if the town of Maycomb came alive in my head!  Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus is inspired and brilliant.  I thought Colin Wilcox was exceptional as Violet Ewell.  My favourite performer and character, however is Scout (as I'm sure author Harper Lee intended).  Mary Badham is just phenomenonal as Scout! (Badham still receives fan mail from all over the world from fans of her portrayal)  She was perfect for the role as she was a real - life Southerner and, having never acted in films before, a complete natural. I loved the character of Scout in the book and I love her in the movie. I've known and heard of girls who empathised and related to her so much that they nicknamed themselves ""Scout"". Harper Lee must have been pleased with Mary Badham's performance which I think is a classic of it's kind. Philip Alford is almost as good as Jem; together they are quite believable as brother and sister. Here comes my one disappointment in the casting :why did they chose John Megna to play Dill?  In the book he was a towhead and not at all like the actor portraying him (he was really Truman Capote, you know)  The kids want to catch a glimpse of Boo Radley and instead they are intruded upon by a great shadow of an unknown hulk of man - it's one of the truly scary scenes. Aunt Alexandria is totally omitted from the film which I'm not sure is advantageous or not. Ruth White is great as the crotchety Mrs. Dubose, however she too, had more to do in the book, where it was revealed that she was a morphine addict. Alice Ghostley is funny as Dill's Aunt Stephanie who warns sternly about the dangers of hanging around the Radley place. Brock Peters is terrific as Tom Robinson, and Estelle Evans is wonderful as the much-loved Calpurnia. I firmly believe that the score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the most beautifully haunting of ANY score done for a film and totally appropriate to the movie.(The original AVA label soundtrack record is a much sought after collector's item). The scene where Scout says ""Hey,Boo"" still makes the tears flow freely, be forewarned and keep the kleenex handy!",943833600,3,2277,4.512135922330097

53171,5,0783225857,"There will never be another movie like it, whether that be because of the world we live in now and that movies are judged upon how much money they make the studio and not really on content. ""To kill a  mockingbird"" would probably flop if released today, no violence, no  nudity, just a beautifully told story. Everything about this classic is  unsurpassed including direction and stunning acting, see this movie just  for the amazing Gregory Pecks perfomance if nothing else. It's hard to  believe that the children in this movie were just that, children. The  acting shown by young ""Scout Finch"" throughout this movie is of  Oscar calabre. A movie like this does only come along once in a lifetime.",940118400,2,699,4.775
53172,5,0783225857,"I first read Harper Lee's Pulitzer winning novel when I was in the 10th Grade, and I watched the movie adaptation soon thereafter.  With this new DVD version of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", I have developed an even  greater appreciation of this timeless story told through the eyes of Scout.  While this story is timeless, I was taken aback to see how much the times  have really changed.  What other story could depict the legal profession in  such a noble manner?  After watching Atticus Finch argue on behalf of Tom  Robinson, there is no one  who could not help but have some great  admiration for the role of the lawyer.  There is much to contrast with our  notion of lawyers today... self-absorbed fictional lawyers such as  ""Ally McBeal"" and pandering ""real-life"" lawyers like  the O.J. defense team.  Perhaps this can be attributed to the obvious  nature of evil in simpler times when the values were black and white.  This  DVD version is beautifully re-mastered in B/W...I was especially enthralled  by the scenes of Jem, Scout and Dill at the old Radley House, and of Jem  and Scout's ""final journey"" together through the woods.  These  Southern gothic scenes evoke all of the childhood fears and insecurities  which most of us remember, over the backdrop of extreme societel repression  and cruel poverty.  The added director's commentaries and featurette are of  tremendous value in further understanding this movie.  ""To Kill a  Mockingbird"" was fittingly ranked in the AFI's top 100 of the 20th  Century.  This movie was a labor of love and will touch anyone who watches  it.",928281600,2,1586,4.871698113207547
