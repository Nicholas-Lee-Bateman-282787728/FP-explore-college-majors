6681153,5,B00NVSFBRK,"Katy opens her backstage dressing room, her wardrobe and her heart for the cameras. It mostly focuses on behind the scenes of the Hello Katy year-long world tour, as she works her little strawberry flavoured socks off touring the world. If you've never heard of her, (really?) this is a good place to start.",1419811200,7,307,4.703703703703703
6681154,1,B00NVSFBRK,Unofficial and very clearly so...you can tell how unofficial this is by the lack of production values and poor excuses for detailed or even accurate info on the singer Katy Perry's career and life. Hardly any exclusive or even remotely interesting footage of Katy herself and you've all heard and seen this before.,1419120000,,314,4.943396226415095
6681155,4,B00NVSFBRK,"Katy is a one of a kind performer, and this video proves it.",1457049600,,60,3.6923076923076925
6681156,3,B00NVSFBRK,"I like Katy Perry. Her music is ""Her"". She is quite on the ball. This her business.",1455580800,,83,3.9411764705882355

6681162,1,B00NVSFBRK,This was disappointing. It felt like old news and gossipy. I prefer the concert movies!,1445558400,,87,4.866666666666666
6681163,3,B00NVSFBRK,I would have liked to hear her sing at least a little.,1444867200,,54,3.5833333333333335
6681164,5,B00NVSFBRK,Katy rules!!!!!,1444176000,,15,7.0
6681165,5,B00NVSFBRK,Movies that show the journey of what a star must go through are always special. I like that they aren't always showing the good side of things so that you really understand what it takes to make it at that level. It's good people know that things don't come easy to the stars- it takes hard work and talent!,1443398400,,307,4.220338983050848

6681167,3,B00NVSFBRK,I have watched several Katy Perry movies and this was not the best one she has.  I think some of the other movies she has was done better than this one.  It wasn't bad just not like the others.,1442361600,,193,3.923076923076923
6681168,4,B00NVSFBRK,Like concert footage. She is a great performer but I don't feel like I know anymore than that from film,1441584000,,103,4.2

6681172,1,B00NVSFBRK,"If you wanted to know about Katy Perry 5 years ago, by all means watch this film. Watching random clips and reading various Wiki articles online would provide similar benefit. If nothing else, this film is great motivation to do something better with your life besides watch TV; I know I did.",1440633600,,292,4.634615384615385
6681173,5,B00NVSFBRK,I love Katy Perry and I really enjoyed this,1440288000,,43,3.888888888888889

6681175,3,B00NVSFBRK,"This is essentially a TV show moved to video. If you're interested in learning about Katy Perry's personal life, this show will give you more details on her family life & history with a little less spin & glitz than ""Part of Me"" but -- somewhat ironically -- it seems *less* intimate than that film because so much of ""Katy Perry: Getting Intimate"" involves watching other people talk about her.",1439337600,,395,4.6571428571428575
6681176,3,B00NVSFBRK,It was cool!,1439337600,,12,3.3333333333333335
6681177,5,B00NVSFBRK,"My Daughter is into Katy, she loved the show.  I was with her and I thought it was pretty good.  I would have given 4 stars, but I gave 5 stars just because I'm not into her all that much, so I am already partial to not giving her 5 stars, which is unfair.  so five stars it is.",1439251200,,278,3.6779661016949152
6681178,1,B00NVSFBRK,"This is worse than an episode of VH-1's ""Behind the Music"".  Gossip columnists are interviewed about what Katy is REALLY like.  This is not a documentary film by any stretch.  Terrible, shallow waste of time.",1438992000,,208,4.885714285714286
6681179,5,B00NVSFBRK,Great show,1438819200,,10,4.5

6681181,4,B00NVSFBRK,Alright,1438473600,,7,7.0
6681182,5,B00NVSFBRK,Katy is a natural. Obviously talented but also hard working. Her fans love her and I can see why. She has an air of humility about her and it makes you feel  that your entertainment is everything to her. She is a pro at what she does. We love you Katy.,1438214400,4,252,3.9411764705882355

6681190,5,B00NVSFBRK,"Intimate backstage pass. Answers the eternal, burning question: How does one go about asking Katy out. The answer: Very carefully and ""it's a small pond,"" guys. {she's mine.}",1430784000,,174,5.25
6681191,2,B00NVSFBRK,"I was expecting something of the caliber of Taylor Swift's ""Journey To Fearless."" Stories and songs mixed in together. Some heart and honesty moments. Not close.

While the production value (camera, editing, sound, etc) of the program kept me awake and attentive most of the time, the content did not. No musical performance by Perry, a handful of entertainment talking-head groupies praising everything about the artist, and no depth/insight from the material, or the artist's own statements. I watched the show with the intention of being sold on why I should download some of her music, like I did right after watching Swift's ""Fearless.""

The only interesting news here, although limited, was finding out that she supposedly writes her own material. That part earns the two stars. The rest you could discover on the Entertainment shows ""every weeknight at 6:30!"" No ""getting intimate"" required.",1429747200,,898,5.229166666666667
6681192,3,B00NVSFBRK,Okay.  I didn't watch the whole thing.,1428105600,,38,4.428571428571429

8680517,4,B00NVSFBRK,"Love Katy Kat. I saw her first documentary and was surprised how much I enjoyed it. In fact, it was one reason why I have comets enjoy her music. Seeing documenatrys and behind the scene content makes me love and appreciate her music more.",1473638400,,239,4.454545454545454
