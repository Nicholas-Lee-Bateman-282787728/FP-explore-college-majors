7908907,5,B00000G3N5,"The Daimajin films are easily the BEST monster films to come out of Japan.... ever.... and this is the best of the three. Being the second in the series, it follows the story of the first film without mimicing it completely and without making it look as though the two films are mirror images of each other. The EFX are even more amazing than the ones in the first film, with the parting of the waters by the giant Majin being absolutely spectacular. My only complaint is not within the movies themselves, but with ADV's release of them. 1) ADV didn't put them on DVD (or at least haven't yet) like I would have greatly preferred. 2) ADV released them in the wrong order. Daimajin is indead the first film, but Daimajin Ikaru (literally the Daimajin gets Angry but deen here as Wrath of the Daimajin) is second, with Daimajin Gyakyushu (Daimajins Counterattack, here Return of the Daimajin) being the third in the series. But with that put aside as simply a small error made by ADV films, the movies are the greatest. The filming of all three is breathtaking (and deserving of all 5 stars), but this is the best out of all three.",1007856000,3,1129,4.512195121951219
7908908,5,B00000G3N5,"Wrath of Daimajin is quite a spectacle.  The focus is not too similar to the first one, only that there is a power-mad warlord killing and enslaving people.  Actually, warriors are secretly into the protagonist's domain from a nearby place.  Assasination attempts are made on royalty.  It leads up from there into a great movie that beats the first two by a landslide.  When you see Majin, as he is called,(Where Daimajin, or Giant Majin, came from I don't know) rise from the water and part the sea, you'd be amazed at how well it was done.  And I'm not talking about for the sixties, I mean nowadays.  Later on, Majin enters a canyon where the evil army makes its last stand.  They try to blow the god up, literally.  It is such a cool blast, and it is coreagraphed very well.  The special effects director sure did an outstanding job.  But a nice touch at the end is when the warlord antagonist is trying to escape via the water.  Not only is Majin chasing him, but he throws a fireball right at the small boat.  As the fire consumes the boat, he climbs the small sail, but gets caught in the ropes and it looks like he's tied to a cross and gets crucified.  A must see for fans of Japanese flicks, monster movies, Akira Kurosawa, Samurai films, or just about anything.",1006214400,5,1272,4.4034334763948495
7908909,5,B00000G3N5,"Most people think this is the best one,I'm more partial to the  first(Daimajin/aka Majin,Monster of Terror)because Majin was much more  hateful & violent. This is a gem also,when everybody's  favorite 40 foot  stone samurai god parts the sea to save another hord of helpless &  oppressed,Majin worshipping slaves from  another evil warlord,is without a  doubt,the most impressive special effect out of all three. Yoshiyuki  Kuroda(special FX)is a genius. The music by Akira Ifukube is his most  frightening ever. I myself own all 3 movies & this one is second best in  the trilogy. My advice,buy all three & watch them one after another. I  love these movies!!!(though I wish they were dubbed instead of  sub-titled)",969235200,3,716,5.130434782608695
7908910,5,B00000G3N5,This is the best one. When Maijin appears for the first time and parts the sea. WOW!!!! Great special effects and tremendous score. It's like The Ten Commandments meets Seven Samurai meets Godzilla.,919296000,5,198,5.03030303030303
