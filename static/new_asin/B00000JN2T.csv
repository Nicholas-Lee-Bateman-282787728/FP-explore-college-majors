The two government agents are the only fun part of the movie and it's unfortunate we have not seen more of them.  If you want to see a true ""C"" movie then go ahead and buy it.  But I recommend you save your dollars for some old Roy Rogers movies.  They'll definitley be more satisfying.",1321833600,2,463,3.924731182795699
7912823,1,B00000JN2T,"When they say that some movies get better as they go along they didn't mean this one. It is the worst movie I have seen in years. The acting is bad, the plot is bad and it does not get better as you go along. It is a very predictable movie so you will know what is going to happen before it happens almost every time. Not a movie to waist your time on.",981763200,8,352,3.77027027027027
7912824,5,B00000JN2T,"I have a hobby of watching bad movies with my friends. We even have a website where we put our reviews up them up now. This was the original movie that got us started on the genre of B Movies.
This movie has everything: actors who have the talent of a high school play, bad 80's special effects, a drunken vicar, strip club scenes thrown in for no plot development ((just thrown in to try to keep the male audience interested)), ERIC ESTRADA! , and a mini van of death! This movie is great for a good laugh so get it, gather a bunch of friends together, and have a good evening laughing away!",971395200,15,592,4.201754385964913
