7938001,1,B00005BSMF,"This review is strictly about the format rather than the content. This format is referred to as a ""digital comic book."" This is not a ""dvd graphic novel"" such as; Astonishing X-Men, Iron Man Extremis or Thor and Loki. This product is simply still pictures of the comic book with voice overs. Obviously there are people who like this format based on the positive reviews. I generally do not believe in writing negative reviews about products unless I think there is confusion about the actual prouct or it's contents, which is the case here. My purpose here is to alert those who think this is the same as a ""dvd graphic novel,"" which actually has moving characters and action shots. A dvd graphic novel is not actual animation but more like video game graphics. There are people who absolutely hate the dvd graphic novel format also but I personally find them very enjoyable. The three that I listed earlier are part of the ""Marvel Knights"" series. There is also a ""Black Panther Marvel Knights"" dvd graphic novel which I have not seen yet but I will soon. Astonishing X-Men was very good with a lot of action. Thor and Loki was also very good. Not as much action but a good story line. Iron Man Extremis is more politically oriented wih less action but still enjoyable. Again, the biggest difference is that this product (a digital comic book) is simply still pictures of the actual comic book versus the dvd graphic novels which have video game like graphics/animation, no word bubbles (which I personally find extremely distracting) and the voice overs are pretty good. Keep in mind that the dvd graphic novels are definitely not for youngsters. They are much darker and the content is very mature as opposed to the digital comic books. The digital comic books (like this product) may be more to your liking if you have young children who may find them enjoyable. I gave this product one star because I honestly do not like the format but this does not mean that it will not be appealing to others.",1329609600,4,2001,4.655367231638418
7938002,5,B00005BSMF,"I stopped reading comics in the mid 90's. The influx of Superhero Movies (Spiderman, X-Men, Blade & Hulk) totally got me back into the Marvel world. I purchased all the DVDS that Sock Puppet studio produced and I loved them. For basically the same price as a Graphic Novel you get a DVD with over 2 hours of material. I think the format might not be for everbody but for somebody who has been away from Comics this should pull you back quickly. I have been waiting for them to release other titles soon.",1089158400,5,503,4.361702127659575
7938003,5,B00005BSMF,"Using the actual art and story from the X-Men comics (in this case the Ultimate X-Men), and adding voices to the characters, injecting special effects and music, you get a full blown X-Men adventure that cannot be any closer to the printed comic books. Volume One is a great start and the rest of the digital comic book volumes in the line are great as well. What every X-Men collector needs. Amazon carrys all the Intec digital comic books so you don't have to go searching for them. Can't wait for more.",1081382400,5,505,4.5
