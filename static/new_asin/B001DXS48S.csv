8295345,4,B001DXS48S,This is a nice collection of Dale Earnhardt's victories.  Personally I might have included one of his Bristol wins but that is really just my own personal opinion.  The one complaint I have of these DVDs is that they don't include the complete races. It would have been worth it to pay even a little bit more to include the complete race for these wins.,1237248000,2,353,4.415384615384616
8295346,5,B001DXS48S,"Considering that this series comes from A&E, the network that can make a great series about anything, even loggers in Oregon (Ax Men), I'm really looking forward to it. Dale was one of the greats; had he taken better care of himself and used more available safety measures, he'd still be racing. This DVD set will have the sights and sounds of his great driving. Sounds terrific!",1221264000,,379,4.6716417910447765
8295347,1,B001DXS48S,Be aware of this dvd that they are not the complete races but 10 films about 45 minutes worth each full of highlights just for you diehard fans interested.  I want full races not just highlights.,1221177600,8,195,4.416666666666667
