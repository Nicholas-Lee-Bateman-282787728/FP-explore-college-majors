2106205,5,B0002MFG5A,"The Frenchies pulled this movie off fantastically!  This is about two French boys studying in a Catholic School,  who are in love with each other.  Im smittened by how the story adds so much character of wholeness, innocence, and bitter sweet love into these two boys (one about 15, the other about 10) to the point I didn't cringe at seeing them kiss.  And I also rooted for their love.

But alas, love so divine will be asundered, by the Abbot.  And he is bent on throwing the older boy out of  the picture, out the school. Under the pretense and (his unbelievable) denial, he claims his motives for the younger boy is out of altruism.  No, here's the twisted part, he is lusting after the boy.  Eeeew.

When the Abbot rids of the older boy, he is smug as a pug.  But only for the Superior to pull a fast one on him.  This movie goes beyond 88 minutes, as the box says.  The last 15 minutes is a didactic conversation between the Abbot and the Superior.  Therein lies the moral.

I really wanted this movie to have a happily-ever-after-end, or my definition of it.

This movie reminds me of ""My Life as a Dog"".  Yes, the Sverige version.

Enjoy the flavour of this movie.",1097280000,16,1173,4.351851851851852

8029520,5,B0002MFG5A,"The Fire That Burns has been placed on my personal list of favorite movies. I think it was very well done in all respects from start to finish. As a Christian it speaks to me on a personal level, and with each watching I am more impressed by how artfully yet gently the story is presented. I do take issue with the notion expressed elsewhere that the young actor who portrays Serge could have been more animated. To me he was perfect for the part. In fact, I can find no fault with any of the acting in this film. It goes without saying, then, that the direction was spot on as well. This is a keeper.  My only caveat with the DVD is that, while admitting that my French is extremely limited, the English subtitles are loosely translated at times, and occasionally misleading. If one has any knowledge of French at all, my advice would be to read the subtitles while at the same time listening to the French. A second and third watching helped me to gradually zero in on exactly what is being said. But this is only a minor fault and did not detract from the story even in the first watching. Recommended.",1479686400,,1105,4.338164251207729
8029521,5,B0002MFG5A,"What a film. It takes place in a Catholic Boy's School. It is a complex story and can't be simply reviewed. Two of the boys fall in love with each other.
There is a difference in their age by....Hmmm....3 years ? One priest is aware of the relationship the boys have. He is very kind to the boys, but he is also fighting his inner gay feelings. He longs for what the boys have.  This movie is a masterpiece. It has English subtitles.
You don't have to be gay to enjoy the beautiful story. I would really not call it a gay movie. Buy it. You will love it.",1466985600,,554,4.08256880733945
8029522,4,B0002MFG5A,"Excellent multiple layered drama sent in a Catholic boys school which is a boarding school with a few non-boarding students. The plot centers around the relationship between a priest and two students. If you look only at the surface this is a love triangle, the priest loves the younger boy and is jealous of the older boy who also loves the younger boy. But that is an oversimplification of the movie.
First of all there is more than one kind of love. There is Christian or unselfish love which is commanded by the Bible, there is the love for family members, there is the love one feels for a good friend, and there is romantic love. These different kinds of love, and ever how much some of the characters understand the differences, are part of the multiple layers of this drama. Another layer is that of manipulation. One or more of these three characters is manipulating one or more of the others. Also playing into the overall plot is that certain school rules are not enforced uniformly, but at the discretion of the priests. Further more, how much does the Superior know of what is really happening here? When does he know it? Why does he let it continue as long as he does? Did he take the best action when he did act? It is this type of layers which make for a good drama. After watching this movie once I had several unanswered questions, however after watching a second time most of these questions were answered at least to some extent. You may want to watch this movie more than once. I still have one question after watching it a second time, and I hope this is not too much of a spoiler: Was the entire relationship between Souplier and Sevrais initiated by Souplier for the purpose of manipulating Abbot de Pradts?
One final comment, just to make it clear considering the overall plot, this movie does not contain any nudity, sex, nor profanity.",1386374400,,1862,4.544642857142857
8029523,2,B0002MFG5A,"I have seen many rave reviews of this film which mystify me. When I excitedly sat down to watch this film after seeing so many rave reviews I was shocked see what I was actually seeing was a rather poor disguised remake of the 1963 French film  ""Les Amities Particulars"".Compared to the 1963 film with the fantastic child actor Didier Haudepin the boy actors are flat and compared to Didier Haudepin's role in the 1963 film Haudepin blows the combined acting efforts of all concerned out of the water in his preformance. The only thing I can guess is that all the people out there giving this film 4 or 5 stars is they have never seen the orginal 5 star film ""This Special Friendship"" (Les Amities Particulars)-as a remake,this film bombs rather sadly in comparison in acting,tension,soundtrack and most notably the photography as if one compares the orginal [...] b&w to the modern color version one sees the the B&w was better suited for the story

8029524,4,B0002MFG5A,"This film is about a French play set around the late 30's in all boys Catholic school. It deals basically with what I think three levels of love: the innocent love between two very young boys, the fatherly love of one of the school priest for the youngest boy, and the love of God between that priest and his superior.

This is a very sophisticated, intellectual, philosophical story with superb acting very much model to what would be a theater drama play. Even though there are hints of the love between the boys to be of a homosexual nature, I am just not sure that boys that young are capable of understanding the whole concept of love.

The story revolves around three main characters: Sevrais, the oldest boy, Souplier, the youngest kid, and L'Abbe de Pradts, the priest. Sevrais is in love with Souplier. Souplier reciprocates to a certain extent as there is a brief kissing scene between the two of them. But he stills acts like the spoiled brat, where he takes the attitude, I take it or leave it. On the other hand Sevrais is the more matured lover. L'Abbe de Pradts has taken a primary interest to look after Souplier, crossing some boundaries between being a teacher and his student. Even though to me the priest comes out as rather spooky and to forthcoming in his relationship with Souplier, I think the plays intention is just merely to demonstrate a level of love, the fatherly love of this man for a misguided, and troubled boy.

Sevrais and Souplier are caught in the school storeroom by the Abbe, causing Sevrais to be expelled. There is a tender scene between the boys which you find in couples very much in love. The Abbe relish Sevrais' misery because there may be some type of jealousy in which he can not stand anyone coming between him and Souplier.

Father Superior, the other character, stays behind the scenes pretty much the entire movie, watching the Abbe and his interaction with the two boys. He realizes that there is more than meets the eye, and puts an end to all of this, by expelling the other boy, Souplier. The destruction of the Abbe toward Sevrais is pretty much done in reverse by the Superior vanishing his love.

There is a final confrontation between the Abbe and Father Superior, in which there is a very metaphysical and philosophical discussion of God's love and humans.

This is a heavy duty, strong movie. The actors are all good. If you like movies with a very intellectual theme, this story is for you. There are a couple of interviews on the special features with a much older Sevrais (still very handsome) plus Father Superior.",1205798400,2,2581,4.636761487964989
8029525,5,B0002MFG5A,"""Pay attention"", That could pass for what a teacher says to the class or what is being broadcast to the world at large.

The subtext for this movie is: ""Some kids should be left the hell alone"".

Two boarding school boys evolve in a loving relationship. It does not go unnoticed by a predatory priest. Persecution follows, all the while the boys continue their contact, friendship, and warmth.

The age difference between the two boys may upset some people who are shocked at the very idea of their relationship, let alone a priest who insinuates himself between them. Don't these priests have a life?

Attending a catholic school from grades 1 to 12 I learned to hide my affections for fellow students. This was taken as non-attachment to be remedied by the spiritual and physical ministrations of priests.
This movie nails it. No matter what critics may say, I say ""You haven't been there, so shut up.""

My only sad regret is that I did not battle them, but in retrospect, I had no power.",1167955200,3,990,4.634285714285714
8029526,4,B0002MFG5A,"I will not go into what this movie is about. I did not read a book....yet, so I can't realy compare it to the movie. However, after viewing The Fire That Burns, I was left with a feeling that something was missing or the movie was too plain. As if, all scenes (except two last ones) were shorter than they could've been--typical French movie. For example there was only one brief intimate scene, and I feel like there could have been more. Yet overall, the movie was done well and plot made perfect sense. I enjoyed it. Let's now hope for the Canadian, modern, remake. I doubt Hollywood will have the balls to pick this story up.",1106006400,10,629,4.384615384615385
8029527,5,B0002MFG5A,"Ah, les Francais! Only they could make such a sensitive film about the love between two boys, and without sex, nudity or (believe it or not) profanity!
  This is a real romance in the noblest sense. It never descends to lesser things than a pure expression of human affection and its relationship to the sacred - the theme of the movie.
  It is Sevrais, the handsome, doe-eyed, love-smitten 15 year old played with heart-crushing feeling by Nael Marandin that energizes this film till its dark ending. His overpowering love for young Souplier transports one to a new level of experience of the profoundly transforming power of friendship, last seen in the 1963 French film 'This Special Friendship' (Les Amities Particulieres), an almost identical story.
Sevrais' love for Souplier never falters from his first scene when he is searching the school grounds for Souplier. Upon seeing him his face beams with rapture as it does later in the scene in the gym when he is transfixed by Souplier's entrance.  And you feel again how hopelessly Sevrais is smitten when one night instead of going home, he stands under the choir room window in the cold darkness just to hear Souplier's voice. This is no ordinary love story!
  The most moving moment occurs in the cave when Sevrais and Souplier embrace which lends power to the rest of the movie's soaring theme.
  There are two tangled stories in this film.  The jealous and manipulating priest, Abbot de Pradts, and his seeming fatherly affection for Souplier and enmity towards his rival Sevrais; and that between the two boys. In the long marvelously scripted final scene between de Pradts and the Father Superior, the tables are turned and the question of what is profane and what is sacred love is addressed in a powerful exchange.
  As for Sevrais and Souplier - well, it couldn't end like this! (I have ordered the book in French in hopes of finding a happier ending.) Shattered, Sevrais leaves the school in shock, broken, empty, tear stained, a shadow of his former impeccable self, dying the slow death of separation from Souplier, the light of his life.
  This is a gem of a film.  The taboo subject of love between two boys is opened an we see that it can rise suspened between the sacred and the profane, pulling us into Sevrais' world where we can feel the power of sacrificial love. (Didn't He say: ""No greater love hath man than this, that a man lay down his life for a friend""?)
  Five stars for this film? How about the whole Milky Way!
  Vive les amities particulieres! Vive les Francais!",1101340800,29,2549,4.73922902494331
8029528,5,B0002MFG5A,"THE FIRE THAT BURNS may seem like an odd title for this French film originally titled LE VILLE DONT LE PRINCE EST UN ENFANT (""The Land Where the King is a Child"") - until the final scene.  But such idiosyncrasies abound in this story set in WW II Paris and at times the blend of surrealism, nascent passion, mysticism, philosophy, and ecclesiastic order makes this film feel like visual and cerebral flights of fancy. The trip is worth it!

Abbot de Pradts (Christophe Melavoy, who also directs) is a handsome, sensitive priest in a Catholic boys school in Paris, a school whose boys live both on-campus or at home.  de Pradts has taken under his wing a poor, beautiful young boy Souplier (Clement van der Bergh) whose studies suffer and who is somewhat of a behavior problem.  Souplier thrives on the attention paid him by de Pradts, but is more focused on another older student Sevrais (Nael Marandin) with whom he spends time skipping classes, exploring, and actually loving: the very pure and lovely love affair between these two lads is beautifully captured by both the actors and the director. It is not long before de Pradts feels jealousy for the influence of Sevrais on Souplier, and eventually de Pradts finds a way to remove Sevrais from the school.  This of course results in his demanding that Souplier forsake Sevrais and the results of this demand constitute the finale of the film best saved for the viewer to discover.

Though the suggestion of de Pradts' physical attraction to Souplier is sub rosa, the head of the school Father Superior (Michel Aumont) observes  the dynamics and in a visceral confrontation between the two priests probes the meaning of sacred vs. profane love.  The sublime intelligence of this duet is some of the best writing ever for film on this difficult subject and both Malavoy and Aumont give performances of great power and depth.

""The Fire That Burns"" is that passion within the soul that can lead to evil if not sublimated.  de Pradts has fallen victim to that fire and allowed 'the child to be the  king of his land'.  This is a powerful movie, graced with stunning sets and photography, and a score that is based on Gounod's music ('Kyrie eleison') throughout.  Highly recommended.
