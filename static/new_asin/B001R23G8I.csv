8337205,5,B001R23G8I,I only got three chapters that only showed how to make chocolate delight (ch1)&(ch2) Lasagna & last (ch3) Chocolate peanut butter balls. Im disappointed that it didn't show how to make biscuits and more. Please advise why this was so short. Is there any more volumes?P.S. I made a mistake My DVD player wasn't working correctly. A very pleasant experience to watch a master!,1520812800,,374,4.859375
