8199957,5,B000RBKRV4,"short, incisive and well done-- a must read if your desire is the truth not just doctrine",1488758400,,89,4.294117647058823
8199958,5,B000RBKRV4,"The information in this DVD is amazing.  I am a Messianic Jew, now I have learned I am really a Kerite Messianic Jew.  When I was a Child my mother (Protestant ... my Bio Father was Jewish ... My mother married a Catholic and I was even being brought up to become a Priest).  I later as an adult  left the Catholic Church due to I read the WORD OF GOD, and saw how much the Catholic church taught only man made traditions over the BIBLE. Until I saw this teaching ... I was missing an argument part that was more specific ... and that is how much the Catholic Church and the Oral Torah Pharisees are very similar  and how much Yeshua  taught how wrong they were / are in placing mans tradition over the WORD OF GOD. Catholic church has even rewritten the 10 commandments something that even the Oral Torah Pharisees would never think of doing due to they fear God. The speaker is a Jew, not a Messianic Jew.  You will learn so much in the short 2hr lesson ... which made me want to buy it and the book.  Every believer (Believe in the Bible means Trust) needs to see this.  It is on you tube, but once you see it you will buy it.",1454803200,,1129,4.095454545454546
8199959,5,B000RBKRV4,"Gordon comes from a long line of Pharisees.  I had no idea that today modern Pharisees are still using the same ""traditions of men"" (and a lot of new ones!) that are mentioned in the ""New"" Testament.  For example, I did not understand, until I saw this DVD, what the whole dispute over washing hands before eating was really about.  This book adds onto the heap of archaeological and historical facts which show the Bible is totally accurate.

Gordon is a good speaker, funny but incredibly informative.  So much information I have had to listen to the DVD more than once to get it all, but it was fun each time.

 Disclaimer:  Gordon is not a follower of Messiah last I heard.  He even has at least one ""traditions of men"" idea he is pushing, in fact.  For ex. he says that men have to sight the new moon for it to be an official new moon.  Uh, 'scuze me, David begged out of a happening with Saul the day before a new moon was ever sighted, citing the next day's new moon as his excuse.  The Israelites kept exquisite records of astronomical events like the new moon so it's not like they had to see a new moon to know there was one.  Besides, what determines when there is a new moon, our eyes, or our Creator's eyes and His skies?

Nevertheless in this DVD Gordon pushes no traditions of men that I noticed, only exposes those that he has escaped from himself, and does so combining scholarship that is always the opposite of dull.",1390953600,,1435,4.345864661654136
8199960,5,B000RBKRV4,"I was just getting ready to order the book--which goes more in depth.  This video is eye-opening for any serious Christian scholar. Gordon is able to show where and why there are so-called ""contradictions"" in Scripture--not because Scripture contradicts itself, but because in translating the original text some of the words became corrupted thus making the some of the passages incoherent with the rest.  For a detailed review, I recommend that you read some of the other 5-star reviews associated with this product as they are what I relied on to make my purchase and I completely agree with them 100%.  This is definitely a 5-star product!",1315094400,,642,4.981308411214953
8199961,4,B000RBKRV4,I bought this dvd to go with GORDON'S BOOK THAT WAS GIVEN ME.  I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I have reread the book many times as well as watching the dvd and have found the information found within astounding.  I highly recommend this dvd to all those interested in knowing the truth of scripture.  Shuwshan,1311465600,2,298,4.381818181818182
8199962,1,B000RBKRV4,"Another amateurish home video, this is purly a video of a on stage lecture, no props no grahics just a boring video of a leture given by Nehemia Gordon. Definitly no of the quality that would be on nation geographic or History Channel. Not worth the money.",1253923200,,256,4.468085106382978
8199963,5,B000RBKRV4,"This is, hands down, The Best DVD and book I have ever purchased!
This young man is a great speaker, humorous and interesting. He is erudite and brilliant and knows His subject exceptionally well. He gave us much to consider in following the Hebrew Yeshua as opposed to the Greek characterization of Jesus that is taught in the Christian Church today.
I strongly suggest that others purchase both products.",1247875200,5,406,4.898550724637682
8199964,5,B000RBKRV4,"If you are satisfied with your religious beliefs, and are content that your spiritual leaders are teaching you everything you need to know, then this video is NOT for you!

Nehemia Gordon, a Hebrew scholar, explores ancient manuscripts that present evidence that some or all of the New Testament was originally written in Hebrew; that the Greek texts from which we translate the NT into English are ""third-party"" sources. Focusing on Shem-Tov's Hebrew Matthew, conflicts that appear to exist in the New Testament when read from ancient Greek manuscripts, are resolved and clarified in the Hebrew.

Nehemia Gordon is not a polished TV preacher, and frankly, I would not want him to be. Knowing that he has a huge amount of information to discuss in a short amount of time, he presents his material quickly, while remaining understandable. In spite of his impressive credentials and exhaustive research, this lecture is anything but dull. What helps to keep it interesting is that he occasionally uses slides, and breaks it up with humor from time to time.

Though Nehemia Gordon does not believe in Jesus being the Messiah, it was an inquiry from a Christian friend of his that got him involved in this research project in the first place. The material presented in this video is beneficial to both Jew and Christian.

Run time is approximately 1-1/2 to 2 hours. His lecture is addicting: once you start it, you are not going to want to shut it off until you've heard the very end.",1215907200,3,1480,4.83794466403162

8199966,4,B000RBKRV4,"Great teaching. The subject matter will be challenging to the majority of the Western Church. I particularly enjoyed the view from the Hebrew side.
Nehemia is a sharp and articulate teacher.  His teaching on the book of Matthew was excellent, a real eye opener that brought needed clarity. Nehemia Gordon is a Karaite Jew, this sect of Judaism is as close to Christianity as it gets.  His personal story of revelation is most valuable.
As a pastor, I encourage all Christians to purchase this DVD set, it will bring you closer to your Jewish Rabbi Messiah.
