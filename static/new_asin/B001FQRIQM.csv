8302379,5,B001FQRIQM,"Ex. Sgt. RAF. Life member of Bomber Command Association. Owner of 400  model planes made by Van Kirk, navigator of Enola Gay.

Child evacuee during the War. Bought this for self at Christmas. Overwhelmed with the exact training for each *trade* in RAF. Official govt. information.  So I viewed at various times..or I'd be bored trying to assimilate so much at one time.  So NOT for casual entertainment.  But excellent for the one who love the  truth of training.",1360886400,,463,4.7974683544303796
8302380,5,B001FQRIQM,"Consisting chiefly of Crown Copyright WWII-era training, informational, and some propaganda films, 'The Royal Air Force At War' DVD series is a boon to historians, scale model enthusiasts, and WWII buffs. If, for one example, you ever wanted to learn in detail how to enter, service, operate, and exit a Wellington bombers' two different types of tail turrets, and how to load and unload those turrets' Browning machine guns, then this series will prove to be your cup of tea. These discs afford the viewer a series of windows through which to gaze into a bygone age.",1254009600,5,567,4.855670103092783
