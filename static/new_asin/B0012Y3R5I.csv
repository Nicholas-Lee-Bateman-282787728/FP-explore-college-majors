8248202,3,B0012Y3R5I,"When I was pregnant with my third child I ordered this DVD to watch with my daughter and son to give them an idea of how the baby would grow.  The DVD is wonderful and takes you step by step from conception to birth.  The problem I had was with the book. The book fell apart on me and I contacted the seller - Rocket Rights to correct the problem.  They told me as soon as they ""ran"" another batch of the books they would send me one to replace the book that fell apart.  I contacted Rocket Rights another 3 to 4 times and was told they would mail it.  I never received it.  I would assume that purchasing this from someone other than Rocket Rights might insure your book won't fall apart.  **As a note - I contacted Rocket Rights once again before I reviewed this product to makes things right and as you can tell from this review they never did.",1229385600,,847,4.128048780487805
8248203,5,B0012Y3R5I,I bought this DVD and Book as a gift for my wife not really thinking much of it until I was forced to sit down with her. Its fascinating we were completely mesmerized from start to finish. I realized just how incredible and precious the way life starts not to mention what needs to take place to transform a cell to little embryo and then a baby. The graphics are beautiful -its full of interesting facts and just to see the baby in the womb growing is amazing. It really helps to connect to my wife and what she is going through in her pregnancy. Week by week we will sit down and catch up on developments - can't wait.  I recommend this book and DVD for anyone having a baby or just anyone that wants to know how we came to be.,1205712000,3,729,4.0979020979020975
