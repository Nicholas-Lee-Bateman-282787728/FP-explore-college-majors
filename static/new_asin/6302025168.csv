Lucy is hilarious bouncing around in the locked trailer, fighting with Mike the dog for food, and James Ellison is great at outsmarting his enemy.  A fast hour of light but fun hearted comedy",1492387200,,271,4.645833333333333
7819692,5,6302025168,"I enjoyed seeing Lucille Ball as a beautiful young lady. Actually I enjoyed seeing her without Desi, too. I don't think I had ever seen her without him before this movie. The movie was cute and interesting and I enjoyed myself. Lucille Ball is a lovely actress and she did well in her part. I am glad that I finally got to view this movie. It was a great treat for me. Parts of it were a little bit hokey but that was just part of the fun of the movie.",1442620800,,452,3.978021978021978
7819693,3,6302025168,"I can't help but think that if James Ellison hadn't been the leading man, that NEXT TIME I MARRY would've been a better film. As it is, he's a serviceable but pretty nondescript performer. The responsibility for carrying this film rests squarely on Lucille Ball's shoulders, and she pulls it off like we knew she could.

It's interesting to note that even as early as 1938, when this RKO screwball comedy was released, Lucille Ball showed a comic flair. She plays madcap heiress Nancy Crocker Fleming who one day propositions a row of ditch diggers. Her deceased father's will has something to do with this. Nancy stands to swim in money, except that there's a codicil hindering her future happiness. The will dictates that she must marry a regular guy, a ""plain American,"" or else forfeit the inheritance. This puts a crimp in her romance with Count Georgi (Lee Bowman), that blue-blooded European gigolo. Ah, but what if she marries that ""plain American"" and then promptly divorces him? It sure is a sneaky sidestep, but all's fair in et cetera, et cetera.

The chump who takes her up on her marriage proposal is Anthony Joseph Anthony (Ellison). She offers to pay him $1000. But he's an honorable guy. He only plays along because he's in desperate need of $793. That's the amount he's willing to take from her, no more, no less. Off they go to the nearest chapel, all along he's giving her the hairy eyeball (which sounds really gross). And when he learns that she only married him so that she could turn around and divorce him, well, Anthony Joseph Anthony gets his dander up. He doesn't want to be labeled as a ""Cinderella Man."" Nancy doesn't want to be described as ""N.G."" in the press (""N.G."" for ""no good"").

What follows next is a zany race to Reno to see which one could be first to file for that quickie divorce. It's all lightweight material but enlivened by a very active Lucille Ball. She mugs and caterwauls, sets fire to things and shoots bullets into tires, and even gets into it with a dog over a Virginia ham and a loaf of bread. And all the while she looks gorgeous. I'm going to gloss over the fact that, for most of the film, her character comes across as an insensitive spoiled brat. One shouldn't analyze a screwball like this too deeply. Expect wacky car chases and the heiress getting abducted by the fella we all suspect she'll end up with and nosy reporters angling for a scoop and Lee Bowman's good job at playing the unctuous foreigner who seeks to marry into money. Oh, and the ending's cute.

7819694,3,6302025168,"This is a revue for the WB DVD of the RKO film NEXT TIME I MARRY (1938) which was directed by Garson Canin and stars TVs mega star, Lucille Ball in a movie made years before her real fame.

In  NEXT TIME I MARRY Lucille Ball plays Nancy Crocker Fleming, a heiress whose father left her money on the condition that she only  marries a regular guy, a plain American.  Nancy is already involved with an apparent gigilo ,Count Georgi, played by Lee Bowman,  a member of royalty without a royal cent but on the lookout for someone like Nancy.

But, to appease the tenents of the will she finds a WPA ditchdigger, named Tony Anthony, played by James Ellison who, needing money, agrees to Nancy's plan for a quick marriage and an even quicker Reno divorce.  All of this leads our heroes to a madcap trailer trek to Reno to see who can file for divorce first.

The story's not really as simple as that, there are plenty of complications along the way and in fact, maybe a few too many comic siuations and characters. In fact, this might've been a very funny film if everything in it wasn't more than a little overdone.  Still and all, NEXT TIME I MARRY is certainly watchable and worth tuning in if it shows up on TV. A fairly enjoyable screwball comedy.

I rate NEXT TIME I MARRY Three and One Half Stars.",1284681600,3,1298,4.348547717842323
7819695,3,6302025168,"In this, the second film directed by a very young Garson Kanin, Lucille Ball plays Nancy, a gal who's in love with Lee Bowman, a foreigner: she will inherit an incredible $20 million provided she gets herself a ""real"" American husband. James Ellison plays the ditch-digging Yank Lucy chooses to hitch in order to grab the cabbage - and then rush for Reno in order to get a quickie divorce... Bickering and battling with each other, the duo endure a wild trailer ride en route to Nevada (which is reminiscent of that in THE LONG, LONG TRAILER) & there is the predictable outcome. Implausible but enjoyable nevertheless, there is a lot of action which goes on without any rhyme or reason, but Ball (her eyebrows are a'la Harlow or Dietrich here) is in fine form and she and Ellison play well together. This little flick was actually considered RKO's best ""B"" comedy of 1938 - which isn't saying all that much.",1030579200,3,907,4.6397515527950315
