8358226,4,B0029TQW66,"Alice Cespi (Florinda Bolkan- A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN, DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING) is plagued by a dream, where an astronaut is abandoned on the Moon. She's also been having strange lapses in memory, and is unable to explain her 3-day absence from her job as a translator. The only clues she has, are the name of a town, and a picture of a hotel. So, Alice packs a bag and heads for the town, in search of answers. Once there, the mystery only deepens, as Alice meets a strange girl named Paola (Nicoletta Elmi). She also runs into other people who seem to know her, though she has no idea who they are. Is Alice losing her mind? Is this some sort of conspiracy? What role does Paola play in all this? PRIMAL IMPULSE is a wonderful, suspenseful baffler, as well as a showcase for the beautiful Ms. Bolkan. She's riveting as usual, and is in every scene!

8358228,5,B0029TQW66,"FOOTPRINTS (aka: Le Orme,1975) from Italian shamelessly overlooked great director Luigi Bazzoni, for me one of the Great Italian directors of the Past, never understood and 'forced' to survive, to make just a handful of Cult B Genre films, that,back then, killed his career so sadly,after his first,and also amazing film, starring Virna Lisi and Valentina Cortese,among a great cast,""The Possessed"" (La Donna Del Lago, 1965, one of the finest,most gorgeously B/W's photographed Gothic films ever,but also an introspective piece,maybe not at the level of Ingmar Bergman's work, but close, I swear!),flopped brutally at the international Box Office,and believe me,if you can find it somewhere,you'll be amazed,if you like great Cinema!
Nevertheless, he always managed to make a few films who were always really terrific! Even though, some were Genre films, they were always so classically shot, perfectly crafted and cast! In fact, it's always a pleasure to see the great GIALLO's ""Giornata nera per l'Ariete""(U.S.'s lesser appealing title: THE FIFTH CORD),available on DVD,indeed a fantastic murder mystery thriller, starring Franco Nero,and a sexy supporting Cast of Euro Cult Films Glories! That one was at its time (1972) probably the most commercially successful film directed by Bazzoni,to date,however, not the very best!
So after such a success he was finally given another A list opportunity with the unsettling,mysterious,haunting to say the least, LE ORME-Footprints in 1975.
Beautifully,intensely photographed by Academy Awards Winner and many times Nominee, Vittorio Storaro of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Reds"",with a romantic,unnerving yet perfectly sad score by master Nicola Piovani, Footprints is one of the most mysterious and heartbreaking films ever produced,if possibly, with a plot so original, and brilliant, so wisely developed and written,it can be only defined as a sophisticated investigation of a disturbed woman's subconscious, and so, at the time, it was classified, as a disappointing film, with an abrupt end, from those who were never able to understand it! Main audiences back then were,especially in Italy, not extremely subtle,  and those watching this type of films, wanted more blood and sex, ""a la Argento o Fulci"",and not a meditative,yet always gripping movie,and especially, from its Stars Florinda Bolkan and Genre Cult Legend Klaus Kinski(who appears in a key cameo)! I personally think the audiences and some critics too, at the time, were misled by a real bad marketing campaign, thinking to 'save' commercially this film from a Disaster(which indeed followed, destroying both Bazzoni's last chance, and, for a few years,its main Star's career,lovely and intense,unique, Florinda Bolkan,who'd been since an international sensation, and only,later,recovered and returned to proper Star status!)by leading on with it, all people to think it was some sort of Exploitative Sci-Fi mystery thriller piece, filled with terrifying sequences,including blood and guts.
But this film was not it! It does deliver a wonderfully mysterious,at times, even more than chilling plot, as meticulously structured by both the great Suso Cecchi D'Amico with Bazzoni, himself, who eventually directed the piece with such a peculiar attention to details and casting (wonderful B Movie Queen Evelyn Stewart as the doubting friend of the lead,always intense Lila Kedrova's as a gossipy yet aloof lady,pretty child star Nicoletta Elmi,at her best,in this disturbing role of a lonely child in a very strange,dreamy beach,Peter McEnery so believable in maybe what is the most shady,if difficult role to carry),narration and introspection,style and psychological resolutions and visualizations,to make of Footprints,a masterpiece of rare insight,and 'crescendo',and also including some chilling images that actually seem like effectively shot in the Moon, and a moon that comes out as claustrophobic and terrifying as never before(with the exception of Kubrick's ""2001:A Space Odyssey"",of course,but not that far,i don't believe I am stretching it,at least,concerning the visual quality of such images!) and some very thrilling moments of almost Gothic beauty! But,no matter what, it is at the end, way more, and more like a moody Japanese great film, or even more like a Michelangelo Antonioni's film,than some commercial exploitative sci-fi thriller! Footprints is constantly researching and 'testing' the unconscious,the interiors of a deeply frantic lady desperately trying to find out where and why she's lost(and possibly spent!)almost a week of her life, without any apparent motive, nor memory: she in fact wakes up late, after what she initially thinks to be 'oversleeping',in her classy,modern,and beautifully designed apartment,just to have a few hours later, the stunning surprise, that almost a week,indeed went by,instead,and, after getting even fired,by her prestigious position as an international simultaneous translator,for having missed a few major jobs,that had been scheduled to be attended,just during that lapse of time, she starts (or, maybe, she is to be led..)to believe (and so are we..by the way!) by a few unsettling and perfectly calibrated signs, or quick and deviating flash back's(or at least,what she believes to be glimpses of her disturbed memory),that, without obviously and apparently knowing, she might have been living a second life,and linked to a very unclear,yet frightening Organization, maybe belonging to a possible sect of extra terrestrials, or even worse, a sect/a Lobby 'operated' by some weird spies(but,again,sent by Whom?) trying to take over the Moon,for some obscure,yet dangerous reason, while,instead,those few friends and, sort of 'distant' people, whom -we see- are surrounding this woman's upscale,but, way too suspiciously lonely private life, are all in profound disbelief, not almost paying too much attention to her, in some very unfriendly,suggestively modern, and unique looking, Rome's settings..
As,you have probably understood by yourself,by now, especially, if you're familiar with this superior,and definitely more 'exclusive' type of Cinema,the premise of the haunting ""FOOTPRINTS"" is, more than a B Genre Horror, and (without wanting to take away anything from those!)for its own sake, way too complex of a premise to be effective in that Category,and obviously, it was heavily contrasting with the marketing campaign of this film,which was,like i said,at the time,very oddly,and badly designed to direct audiences to imagine all this,like a very different type of movie,and so wildly clashing with the taste of those same more generic audiences targeted, instead to be, way more cleverly, pushing those,who'd have appreciated auteur Cinema and Art House's classics (I am thinking,here, in the same way,as,for example, the great marketing done to 2 very good Francois Ozon's movies starring Charlotte Rampling -""Under the Sand"",and,""Swimming Pool""-granted to those movies,the big success they obtained,but there's also to be said that such thing was happening way more recently, and not back then,in the somewhat.. more narrow minded Italian&International's Distributor's mentality of the -yet productively brave and greater- 1970's!).
That is the only explanation of why, such a terrific, tight, intense, and classic film, became a real misfire of gigantic proportions,back in 1970's Europe,instead!
Today, it would have not obviously been re-discovered by so many,and so greatly appreciated, for its storytelling, and Film style (maybe even ahead of its own Time!)and been giving to the Film and to its extraordinary director, finally, the much too late fame and glory they'd deserved! But while for a Film,in the same way of Art, there's always time, there's not sadly enough, so much time left for Luigi Bazzoni, whom today at 83, cannot certainly resume a tragically lost and missed film career!
This is really a shame, if someone could, instead imagine, how many great movies he could have directed,placing his name, among the greater Directors,I believe, his Work instead belongs to, and not to be confined to relative obscurity, and making sporadically only (and Great!) Documentaries since then,and, exactly since, the year of release, of this splendid,metaphorical,and deeply rigorous and insightful film, Footprints,from 1975!
A must see,now finally, available in Europe, and personally hope, it will be made available, as well, in a nice and much awaited,well re-mastered and widescreen version in the United States.
For the Sake of great Cinema!",1331596800,,8540,5.625290923196276
8358229,4,B0029TQW66,"Interesting and entertaining 'mind game', dream-like, moody mystery, as
a woman can't account for several lost days of her life, or why so many
people at a resort she's never visited seem to know her.

She's also haunted by very odd black and white dreams where an
astronaut is betrayed and left to die alone on the moon.

The film is slow in parts, and some of the big twists are easy to see
coming, but it is beautifully photographed by Vittorio Storraro, and
eschews the gratuitous violence and awkward sex of most of the Italian
thrillers of the era.

This doesn't feel like its trapped by any formula or rules. And the
acting is pretty good for a dubbed film.

Not in the class of films like 'Don't Look Now"" or ""Vertigo"", but gets
points for trying to be and doing so in a classy way. I'll be
interested to see this again.",1323216000,2,828,4.357142857142857
