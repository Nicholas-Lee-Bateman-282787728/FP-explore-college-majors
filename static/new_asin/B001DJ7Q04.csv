The interview segments where members of Eddie's family as well as the wrestlers he worked with spoke about their experiences with him were absolutely heartbreaking, especially the segment before the final match on the set, where Batista is almost to the brink of tears.

Disc 1

-Vickie Guerrero talks about meeting Eddie and how they hit it off right away, how she didn't even know he was a wrestler until after their first date. Also how good of a guy his dad Gory Guerrero was and how he generously gave to the community of El Paso, Texas. How Eddie had a passion for wrestling from an early age and then discussing his teaming with Art Barr and he helped Eddie a lot in his early career. How his coming to ECW helped launch his exposure to the U.S. fans.

-4/8/95, ECW Hardcore TV, ECW TV Title Match: vs. 2 Cold Scorpio (Champion): Always loved Scorpio's unique style and he and Eddie worked very well in this match. Nice good exchange of wrestling holds by both men, nice heel move by Eddie, offering a handshake then hitting a quick clothesline. Eddie keeps trying to ground the high flying Scorpio, though Scorpio does hit a nice japanese arm drag, dropkick and superkick combo. Eddie hits a nice dive to the outside on Scorpio that brought the crowd to its feet. Plenty of high impact moves and close nearfalls follow and Eddie hits a quick roll-up to become the new TV champion. 8/10.

-Dean Malenko talks about meeting Eddie while working in Japan and how they became close friends. Working in ECW and how Eddie and his styles were much different than the violent matches ECW put on, but also how the fans appreciated and loved how they wrestled.

-4/15/95, Hostile City Showdown '95, ECW TV Title Match: vs. Dean Malenko: You can never go wrong with a Malenko/Guerrero match and this one is no exception. Plenty of good counter wrestling early on, with some good exchanges of moves and even a stand-off between the two that brought the crowd to their feet. Both try to ground the other with various upperbody and leg submissions, Dean works over Eddie's leg trying to get him to submit. This is just a good classic wrestling match, and it goes to the 30 minute time limit, resulting in a draw. 9/10.

-Jim Ross talks about Eddie getting into WCW and how he was happy for him and felt it would get him way more exposure worldwide. Also the New Japan/WCW World Cup storyline is discussed and how the younger lesser known talent would get their chance to shine.

-12/27/95, Starrcade: vs. Shinjiro Ootani: This was during the before mentioned New Japan/WCW World Cup storyline and while a good match, and maybe I'm in the minority here but it didn't seem to fully click for me. There's some very good chain wrestling here, though the announcers at times seem more interested in bantering rather than paying attention to the match. Eddie hits a nice snap powerbomb and a brainbuster both for a 2 count. Nice dive by Ootani to the outside on Eddie. The energy just seems to be lacking in the match and the crowd, Ootani reverses a roll-up for the win. 6/10.

-Ric Flair talks about how he'd known Eddie as a child since he knew his father. He says Eddie is in the top 10 to 20 guys he's ever wrestled and how his work eithic was unbelievable.

-8/10/96, Hog Wild, WCW United States Title Match: vs. Ric Flair (Champion): This is pretty much a dream type match, cause Eddie is so good in the ring and Flair is the man, who can always make people look like a million bucks in the ring. Eddie is pretty agressive in this match as he believes he can take the title from Flair, while Ric does his usually dirty tricks and veteran moves to wear down Eddie working on his leg to set him up for the figure four which Eddie does counter at one point. Eddie hits the frog splash but hurts his already injured knee and Flair slaps on the figure four and Eddie passes out from the pain and gets pinned for 3. Flair retains his title. 8/10.

-Chris Jericho discusses his time teaming with Eddie and how they were good but didn't get to go anywhere cause the higher ups didn't bother to go with the gimmick. Also how good of friends they were and how good of matches they could have cause their work ethic was second to none.

-9/23/97, Superbrawl, WCW United States Title Match: vs. Chris Jericho: Chris talked before about how this was a great match they had but the crowd was so dead that they both felt deflated afterwards. He's right as these two traded some good moves back and forth and the momentum shifted constantly, but the dead crowd just kills it to the point where I felt bad for these two. Eddie hits a sunset flip for the 3 count to retain his title. 7/10.

-Rey Mysterio says Eddie and him had magic in the ring when they faced off, also talking about how their Halloween Havoc '97 match was one of his personal favorites. The chemistry they had and how Eddie was a perfectionist and wouldn't accept anything less than the absolute best in any match.

-11/10/97, WCW Monday Nitro, WCW Cruiserweight Title Match: vs. Rey Mysterio (Champion): As Rey said before whenever these two got in the ring it was magic and this match while short is no exception. Eddie comes out very focused and on fire in the beginning as he was looking to regain his title from Rey and of course Rey hits his high flying moves to throw Guerrero off his game. Eddie hits the frog splash to win the title. 8/10. Nice post match face/off between Eddie and Dean Malenko.

-Dean says Eddie and him worked well in WCW cause for the first year or so they were able to wrestle their type of match and he says Eddie was his favorite opponent.

-12/28/97, Starrcade, WCW Cruiserweight Title Match: vs. Dean Malenko: Like I said before you can never go wrong with a Malenko/Guerrero match, Eddie was in full heel mode here taking all kinds of shortcuts while Dean showed a much more vicious side as he was out to gain the Cruiserweight title. Dean countered a top rope head scissors into a snap powerbomb, Eddie works on Dean grounding him and hitting a nice low dropkick. Eddie hits the frog splash on Malenko's bad knees to retain his cruiserweight title. 9/10.

-Chavo Guerrero says that wrestling was a family business cause his dad instilled it in them from any early age and how they learned to adapt to other people's styles. Also how Eddie and the Ultimo Dragon always had great matches.

-5/17/98, Slamboree: vs. Ultimo Dragon: If Ultimo won then Chavo Guerrero would get his freedom, Chavo was kept kinda against his will by Eddie. This was a pretty good match, nice counter wrestling by both men as they knew each other very well having worked previously in Mexico, Japan and WCW. Seems like at one point the fans are more interested in something happening off camera, likely a fan or two getting thrown out. Ultimo accidentaly hits a spin kick on Chavo, Eddie hits the frog splash for the win. 7/10. Good post match with Chavo being so mad at the result that he took out his aggression on the Dragon, to the point where Eddie pulled Chavo off and begged him to take his best shot but he wouldn't and Chavo walked off.

-Chavo says they had a wrestling ring in the backyard and would learn to wrestle at an early age. How it was great to see Eddie succeed in wrestling and how nice it was to work together. Also how big Eddie's heart was and how a lot of people didn't get to see it.

-8/3/98, WCW Monday Nitro: vs. Juventud Guerrera: Juvi was the quicker of the two though Eddie was clearly the better wrestler. Eddie goes around slamming Juvi to the match and chopping him. Juvi does use his high flying moves like a spinning back kick from the top rope and a suicide dive to the outside. Nice shoulder breaker and a follow-up frog splash by Eddie for the win. 7/10.

-Vickie talks about the cruiserweight wrestlers and how Eddie had no fear in the ring. His car accident which was during his drug abuse days, he had inuries to his elbow, back, pelvic bone and his legs to the point where he had to learn how to walk again. Eddie was very depressed during the time he was healing cause he had to wait to heal.

-6/24/99, WCW Thunder: vs. Psychosis: This was shortly after his return from his accident, the crowd was behind Eddie at this point. Eddie was out for revenege on the former LWO members for disbanding the group while he was out injured. Psychosis hits a nice splash to the outside, Eddie hits a nice head scissors and goes to work on grounding Psychosis and slamming him head first into the ring steps. Eddie is a lot more aggressive in this match, much to the pleasure of the crowd. The action is all over the place and Eddie hits the frog splash to the back, rolls him over for the win. 8/10.

Disc 2

-Chris Jericho says Eddie was a pioneer in helping the smaller guys make it big in wrestling. Also how when Eddie came to WWE he discovered his great persona, namely the latino heat storyline with Chyna that helped shape him into a superstar. Jericho also tells a story of how Eddie would just do quirky things to get a laugh, which is better to be heard to get the effect of it.

-4/3/00, Raw, European Title Match: vs. Chris Jericho (Champion): This was right after Wrestlemania XVI where Jericho won the Euro title. Also this was during the time when Eddie was pursuing Chyna. Eddie came out full of fire looking to take the title from Chris, while Jericho chopped at and sent Eddie up into the lights and back down to the mat. They had a fairly good match where Eddie tried to gain the edge on the outside. Jericho hits the double powerbomb and the lionsault, Chyna makes the 3 count which doesn't count then DDT's Chris. The ref is back in the ring and Eddie makes the cover to win the European title. 7/10. Thus begins the Mamacita storyline.

-Matt Hardy says Eddie was always willing to help out the younger wrestlers with advice, he was very kind hearted and true. Also how he would work a match according to the crowd and how into it they were then pace the match based on that.

-6/8/00, Smackdown, King of the Ring Qualifying Match: vs. Matt Hardy: These two cut a pretty good pace as their styles mesh pretty well. Early on the both counter each others moves, Matt holds onto an arm bar even after Eddie tries powering out of it, then Matt hits a nice tilt a whirl side slam. Great pinfall reversals by both men, none of which lead to a 3 count. Eddie hits a springboard hurricarana into a pin for the 3 count. 7/10.

-Jerr Lawler talks about being familiar with the Guerrero family and how Eddie's wrestling and personality instantly connected with the crowd when he first came out.

-4/21/02, Backlash, Intercontinental Title Match: vs. Rob van Dam (Champion): This was just weeks after Eddie returned to the company and this was easily a dream match of high flying styles. Both these men are magic in the ring when they wrestle each other, the action is back and forth with both men pulling out unique moves and way to hurt their opponent. RVD went for Rolling Thunder but Eddie countered by getting his knees up and then went to work on RVD's back. Eddie brings the belt in, after the referree is knocked down, Eddie hits a neckbreaker onto the belt then hits the frog splash for the win to become the new I.C. champion. 8/10.

-Jeff Hardy brings up watching Eddie wrestle when he was younger and how he was star struck to meet and wrestle him.

-4/29/02, Raw, Intercontinental Title Match: vs. Jeff Hardy: This was during the time where Jeff was being pushed as a singles star, which at this time never quite worked like it did later in his career. Jeff does do a good job hanging with Guerrero in the ring, hitting a nice pair of arm drags. Eddie hits a low dropkick to Jeff's knee and tries grounding the high flying Hardy. Jeff hits a nice superplex and then his usual offense, the referree gets knocked down, then Eddie hits the frog splash for the win. 8/10.

-Edge talks about their rivalry in the summer of '02, how they both felt their matches were good and how the final match they had on Smackdown in Sept. of '02 was a masterpiece and a great way to cap off the feud.

-9/26/02, Smackdown, No DQ match: vs. Edge: Easily one of my favorite matches as everything just clicked. Plenty of hard hitting action, they use some great wrestling holds to start out and both used the various weapons well including ladder, even Eddie got busted open by Edge ramming him face first into it. Eddie hits a nice powerbomb on Edge from the ladder. Edge hits a massive Edgecution DDT from the top of a ladder for the win. 10/10. Nice standing ovation from the crowd, especially for Eddie who was a heel at the time.

-Chavo talks about teaming with Eddie as Los Guerreros, even has a story about how film director Rob Reiner told them he was very entertained by them and how it looked like they were having fun. Also how the fans first hated the team, then after they saw the entertaining vignettes they cheered them. Their feud with Team Angle (Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Hass) and how they enjoy facing them.

-4/27/03, Backlash, WWE Tag Team Title Match: vs. Team Angle (Champions): Its a good classic tag team match as Team Angle had only been on the main roster a few months and already had some good matches. Good wrestling holds, good double teaming and some funny antics by Eddie make this an entertaining match. The momentum swings back and forth, Eddie comes in and hits the frog splash, Chavo makes the cover but Benjamin stops the count. Chavo picks up Haas for a spulex, Shelton grabs Chavo's leg from the outside and Haas falls on top of him for the 3 count to retain their titles. 7/10. Good post match antics with the Guerrero's stealing the tag team titles and celebrating even though they lost.

-John Cena discusses Eddie's personality and how he was the total package in the ring. Cena also says his feud with Eddie helped him a lot. Also Cena talks about loving the lowrider culture even giving Chavo a car that he was custom making for Eddie, beofre he passed away.

-9/11/03, Smackdown, Parking Lot Brawl: vs. John Cena: Nice pre-match promo from Cena during his heel days. Anything goes in this match and while short its pretty brutal as both take shots on the various cars around them. Cena hits a nice suplex onto the hood of the car that looked like it hurt both men. Cena even puts Eddie in the trunk of a car and gets it popped right back up in his face. Eddie puts Cena's head through a car window, and Cena returns the favor. Nice comedic spot with Eddie hitting Cena's head into the steering wheel as the horn honks each time. Chavo comes in hits Cena with a hubcap and Eddie hits a frog splash on Cena from the top of a minivan onto the hood of a car for the win. 9/10.

-Chavo Sr. says that Eddie had a rough time early in the business but how he powered through it and became a star. He also says he misses Eddie and wishes he was still here.

-1/25/04, Royal Rumble: vs. Chavo Guerrero: This was about Eddie saying he would beat Chavo in the match then beat him up afterwards and you could see it early on as he went to get more physical but kept holding back, which allowed Chavo to gain an advantage. The crowd was very much behind Eddie and this was actually a good match that told a good story, Eddie does win a hard fought match-up after hitting the frog splash. 7/10. The post match beatdown he gave Chavo and Chavo Sr. was pretty good too and he left his nephew Chavo bloody in the middle of the ring.

-Vickie talks about how Eddie loved working with Brock Lesnar and how winning the WWE championship was a dream come true.

-2/15/04, No Way Out, WWE Title Match: vs. Brock Lesnar (Champion): Early on Lesnar was very aggressive as he was attacked by Goldberg earlier in the show. The early minutes of the match were about him weathering the storm that Lesnar brought as he hit all kinds of clubbing blows and suplexes on Eddie. He was looking for Brock to make a mistake, which he did and Eddit hit Brock's knee into the ring post, then after Lesnar regained the advantage and then he hit a running knee into the turnbuckle that Eddie dodged. Eddie went to work on Brock's knee even locking on a unique leg lock then and STF that brought the crowd to its feet. Brock fights back nailing a massive belly to belly suplex, but Eddie just won't give up on the much bigger more powerful Lesnar as he kept going for Brock's knee and locking on various leg submissions. A few minutes later as things looked bleak for Eddie, Goldberg made another appearance hitting a spear on Lesnar, Eddie goes to make a cover but Lesnar kicks out. Lesnar went for the F-5 but Eddie countered it to a DDT on the belt. Eddie hits the frog splash to win his first and sadly only WWE Championship. 10/10. The post match celebration with the crowd including him hugging his mother in the front row was very good and emotional. If you don't feel the emotion in this match you don't have a pulse.

Special Features include the Los Guerreros vignettes which were funny in their own right though the outtakes are the best part. So hilarious and such a good time.

Disc 3

-Rey Mysterio talks about how happy Eddie was to be the WWE Champion, how he put his best foward whether it was in an interview, doing an autograph session or make-a-wish foundation trip. Rey also says he wishes Eddie was still here.

-3/18/04, Smackdown, WWE Title Match: vs. Rey Mysterio: This was the first Smackdown after Wrestlemania XX where Eddie beat Kurt Angle and this one while good wasn't their best match. Early on Eddie is almost pinned on a couple of occasions by Rey, then Eddie reverses a bulldog attempt by Rey slamming him into the turnbuckle then goes to work on Rey's left shoulder with a vicious arm bar. Rey does come back with a high impact moonsault from the top rope to the outside. Eddie continues to work on Rey's arm, but he does make his comeback even hitting the 619. He does miss a top rope leg drop and Eddie rolls Rey up to retain his title. 7/10.

-John Bradshaw Layfield discusses the rivalry he had with Eddie in '04 and how even to this day he has heat with a lot of the latino fans cause of the matches they had and what he said about Eddie and his family. He says the matches he had with Eddie were brutal but a lot of fun.

-5/16/04, Judgement Day, WWE Title Match: vs. JBL: Great promo by JBL, so offensive yet so funny, he's a great heel. Eddie makes his way to the ring and after staring down JBL for a minute, the action starts off in physical fashion with Eddie taking his aggression out on JBL for all that he's done. This match could be described in just a few words: Bloody, brutal, gory, vicious. After some intense battling all over ringside, the ref gets knocked down and JBL hits Eddie with a chairshot that splits Eddie open badly, I mean badly that he just gushes blood. He somehow makes a comeback and after all this Eddie hits JBL with the title belt, the ref sees it and DQ's Eddie. JBL wins but doesn't win the title. The post match segment is great as Eddie just beats on JBL more even busting him open. By the time its over the ring mat is stained red with blood, mostly Eddie's. 10/10.

-JBL says wrestling Eddie was like wrestling a livewire and how he feels he is one of if not the greatest mexican superstar of all time.

-7/15/04, Smackdown, Steel Cage Match for the WWE Title: vs. JBL (Champion): This was easily one of the best steel cage matches ever done on live TV as both men brought the intensity and used the cage to inflict pain on the other. Eddie bounces JBL's head off of the cage a few times then misses a frog splash from the top rope, JBL hits a massive superplex from the top. Nice russian leg sweep from the top rope by Guerrero. Eddie takes a brutal hit into the cage the gets the Clothesline from Hell from JBL but only for a 2 count. Eddie hits frog splash from the top of the cage that would've made Jimmy Snuka proud, but after some time only got a 2 count. Some masked guy comes out and prevents Eddie from going over the top of the cage as JBL's feet hit the floor to retain his title. 10/10. Good post match with Eddie removing the mask of the guy to reveal its Kurt Angle.

-Michael Cole calls Eddie magic and how he would always have fun whether he was a heel or a face. The Angle/Guerrero rivalry was talked about and how it worked cause their styles while different meshed really well.

-5/14/05, Smackdown, WWE Championship Series: vs. Kurt Angle: This was a tournament to determine the number 1 contender to face the WWE Champion and nothing can go wrong with an Angle/Guerrero match. There's some early mat based wrestling as Angle tries working on Eddie's arm for a bit even locking on an arm bar. Angle works on Eddie nailing him with a snap belly to belly suplex. Eddie uses some lying, cheating and stealing with a chair and almost gains a 3 count on Kurt. Angle works more on Eddie's ribs and then after some more battling he goes for a steel chair. Rey Mysterio comes out to help Eddie but ends up accidentaly costing Eddie the match, as Angle wins. 8/10.

-Rey talks about how competitive Eddie was and how he earned everything he got in the world of wrestling.

-9/9/05, Smackdown, Steel Cage Match: vs. Rey Mysterio: This was to cap off their feud in the summer of '05 and this was during Eddie's somewhat dark heel turn. Eddie starts off just pounding on Rey slamming him fast first into the cage a few times pretty aggressively. Rey does hit a nice sunset flip into a powerbomb off the second rope. Both men try to escape the cage numerous times, and theres one cool spot where both are on tight rope walking the top rope and Rey hits a dropkick on Eddie. Rey goes for a splash from the top of the cage but Eddie dodges it. Eddie goes to leave through the door, comes back and hits a frog splash for the win. 8/10. Great post match with Eddie trash talking and hammering Rey more.

-Batista says Eddie never made anyone feel inferior and he always made Batista feel like the world champion when he was. He remembers the morning that Eddie died and he talks about the voicemail Eddie left the night before.

-10/9/05, No Mercy, World Title Match: vs. Batista (Champion): This match was at times more about Eddie trying to prove he didn't need to use any lying, cheating and stealing in this match and that he has turned over a new leaf. This was also during Batista's first and best World title reign where he was on fire and virtually unstoppable. It was actually a good match, just not a spectacular one. Eddie tries using some early wrestling moves to throw Batista off his game, while the animal uses his power even throwing Guerrero off of the second rope easily. Batista also uses a side headlock for a couple of minutes just squeezing on Eddie's head. Eddie does hit a nice frog splash onto Batista's back, then Eddie goes to work on it. Eddie uses a lot of submission moves even a texas cloverleaf. Batista hits a spinebuster out of nowhere to retain his title. 7/10. Good post match with Eddie giving respect to Batista for winning the match. Also kinda eerie this was Eddie's last PPV match.

-Batista says after the PPV broadcast was over he called Eddie back to the ring and celebrated Eddie's birthday by singing, which he admits was awful. Everyone interviewed add more comments and say that they wish he was here and that he was always great in the ring and wanted to get better. Also about how contagious his laugh and smile were. They also say he was always willing to talk to other wrestlers about any problems they may have had.

Special Features

-Chris Jericho talks about his first time meeting Eddie and how Eddie wasn't nice the first time, mainly cause he was kinda typsy. Eddie did apologize the next day and they were friends ever since.

-11/11/05, Smackdown: vs. Mr. Kennedy: This was to be sadly, Eddie's final match and its very, very eerie to think he would be dead only a couple of days later. Nice early wrestling by Eddie, Kennedy slaps Eddie who returns the favor with a thumb to the eye. Then he turns the intensity up hammering on Kennedy, but Ken does block the three amigos. The ref gets knocked down and Eddie of course grabs a chair, slams it to the mat, throws it at Kennedy who catches it. The ref sees it and dq's Kennedy an Eddie wins. 7/10. On a side note its odd to think that Kennedy had both Eddie and Umaga's final matches, (Umaga's came during the Hulk Hogan wrestling tour in late '09).

On a personal note I choose to remember Eddie for how he was in the ring and how he became a better person later in life. He always put on a great show, entertained the fans who always got their money's worth from him. I too wish he was still alive and competiting in the ring, but more importantly just living.",1304985600,3,24858,4.417212756662298

The match selection which ranges from his days in ECW to even his final match with Mr. Kennedy(its in the special features section on disc 3) are worth what you pay for and the stories the wrestlers tell about Eddie are great.

3531374,5,B001DJ7Q04,"Sold in the US as a Best Buy exclusive, you get 3 titles, 7 discs (the RAW Tribute show to Eddie is included), and all stacked neatly inside of a tin (in their original packaging) for $40. Its a tremendous value. There is the Viva La Raza match set of 3 discs with the RAW Tribute, the 2-disc collection of Cheating Life, Stealing Death from 2004, and No Way Out 2004 which features Eddie winning the WWE title (which is also included in the other two titles aforementioned). Plus the PPV is pretty underrated, especially with the Cruiserweight Championship match with Chavo and Rey and with Angle, Cena, and Big Show all fighting for the #1 contendership at Wrestlemania XX.

If there were any cons, it would be the almost inexcusable omission of Chris Benoit in the Viva La Raza set. Eddie's story would be a hacked/horribly-edited version without Chris, and though his actions are inexcusable, its a travesty not to at least mention Benoit. His remembrance of Eddie is also edited off the RAW Tribute, but thats small compared to editing the whole main event of the Smackdown tribute show!

In finale, here is my take: If you have a Best Buy around you, pluck down the extra $15 and get this instead. The value speaks volumes of this set, and that alone is worth the five-star review.",1232150400,3,1287,4.615720524017467
3531375,5,B001DJ7Q04,"This 3-Disc DVD set from the WWE is a true profile of a unique and entertaining wrestler from a legendary wrestling family, the Guerreros from El Paso, Texas. It starts him out in Mexico and independent organizations before being seen in ECW facing off with 2 Cold Scorpio and Dean Malenko over the ECW Television Title and the true appreciation of his style from the ECW fans. The Disc then moves to WCW where he has some terrific matches with a Japanese wrestler at Starrcade 1995, as well as against Ric Flair, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio, Ultimo Dragon and Juventud Guerrera (winning the Cruiserweight Championship from Mysterio on Nitro). Then, his WWE stint is profiled, with matches against Chris Jericho, Rob Van Dam, Kurt Angle, Matt and Jeff Hardy, Edge, his nephew Chavo Guerrero Jr. (whom he also teamed with as Los Guerreros), John Cena, Batista and Mr. Kennedy. He also defeats Brock Lesnar for his one and only WWE Championship at No Way Out 2004. He then defends the title against Mysterio, as well as entering into a feud with John Bradshaw Layfield (JBL) and ultimately losing the title to JBL. He is also seen in a cage match against Mysterio on Smackdown! There are brief interviews with some of his friends and opponents, such as Malenko, Jericho, both Hardys, Mysterio, his widow Vickie, his nephew Chavo (and brother Chavo Senior), JBL, Flair, Cena, Edge and Mick Foley. There is also a series of vignettes with he and Chavo Jr. which are very humorous and really showcase a comedic side to Los Guerreros.

3531399,5,B001DJ7Q04,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2015

He was one of the greatest ""sports entertainers"" of this generation & I use that specific term because he not only had great in-ring technical skills as a wrestler but also the personality & charisma to entertain the audience through his antics that lead him to be one of the most popular & successful hispanic wrestlers in the history of the business throughout the world (Mexico, Japan, United States) in Eddie Guerrero.  This is the second DVD set released on him, only for this one to be released after his passing away, in the format of a match anthology with family (Vickie, Chavo Sr. & Jr.), longtime friends (Dean Malenko, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio) & associates (Ric Flair, The Hardys, Jerry Lawler, Edge, John Cena, J.B.L., Michael Cole, Batista) speaking on various feuds/matches & personal stories regarding Eddie between each match.

vs. ECW Television Champion 2 Cold Scorpio - This was Eddie's ECW debut while Scorpio had his shoulder taped up from injury as both men started out exchanging submission attempts on the mat before Eddie was able to his some impactful offense while Scorpio returned it including various styles of suplexes as the action picked up & got more intense to the point where they tried to show mutual respect only for the other to slap it away or shove the other down as they continued to trade momentum with both men taking it to the air as this came down to one man having to be able to catch the other in what was an evenly matched contest from bell to bell.
""ECW Hardcore TV"" Apr. '95

ECW Hostile City Showdown '95

vs. Shinjiro Ootani - Both men were mat wrestling early with both men being so evenly matches that neither man was able to have an advantage for every long as both men executed similar offense against each other such as moves from a springboard position & a powerbomb as Eddie was able to hit him with some lucha libre such as a various head scissors takedown along with some impactful moves such as a spike powerbomb & brain buster to the point where his opponent was bleeding from the nose & lips while Ootani executed his own impactul offense such as a german suplex & one dropkick directly to the back of Eddie's head as this was a very impactful & intense match from start to finish.
WCW Starrcade '95
[Starrcade: The Essential Collection]

vs. WCW United States Champion Ric Flair - Eddie kept staying one step ahead or Flair in the early moments causing Flair to keep going to the outside to try to slow things down & break his momentum along with an attempt counter for one of Eddie's moves that ended badly for both men as Flair finally got some offense with his chops & punches only for Eddie to get more aggressive returning everything thrown at him sending Flair to the outside on more than one occasion causing Flair to resort to his ""dirtiest player in the game"" tactics which Eddie had no issues throwing right back in Flair's face as this match was perfectly summarized in one line from Dusty Rhodes, ""one mistake cost Eddie Guerrero.""
WCW Hog Wild '96

WCW United States Championship Match vs. Chris Jericho - Both men were evenly matched exchanging technical wrestling attempting to work over a different body part while attempting the same offense such as headlock takeovers before both men started to deliver more impactful moves from a powerbomb & brainbuster to different types of suplexes along with going aerial as they continued to trade momentum while also being aware of where they were in the ring as this was a competitive technical match with the only downfall being that the crowd was dead.
WCW SuperBrawl VII

vs. WCW Cruiserweight Champion Rey Mysterio - This was Eddie's rematch from Halloween Havoc weeks earlier as he attacked before the bell very aggressively with repeated backbreakers only for Rey to resort to his aerial assault & using Eddie's own momentum against him with Eddie continuing to come with a vengeance with moves like a dropkick directly to the back of the head & even offense that hurt himself as this was a short but fast paced non-stop match that came down to one man being able to catch the other.

WCW Starrcade '97
[Starrcade: The Essential Collection]

vs. Ultimo Dragon - Ultimo Dragon was wrestling for Chavo Guerrero's freedom from Eddie. This began very fast paced with both men trying to ground the other as Dragon did very impactful kicks while Eddie delivered snap suplexes & dropkicks before taking it to the floor & threw Dragon into the railing before choking him with a cable. Eddie was on the top rope before Dragon kicked Eddie in the head off the ropes to the floor & delivering his trademark moonsault. Eddie continued to bring the offense by stealing Chavo's move in the tornado DDT while also countering the Dragon Sleeper into his own. Chavo got involved by trying to stop Eddie from cheating only for him to accidentally get hit by Ultimo that allowed Eddie to capitalize for the win. Stay turned after the match as Chavo realized that he lost his opportunity to be free only resulting in him finally cracking to the point where Eddie even tried to get him to calm down.
WCW Slamboree '98

vs. Juventud Guerrera - Eddie showed a lack of respect for Juvi only for him to physically go after Eddie with chops & dropkicks only for Eddie to return the aggression with different impactful offense working over the back as they traded momentum with Juvi going aerial coming off the top & going over the top & springboarding off the ropes while Eddie was able to counter & took to the air himself in what was a quick but fast paced match.

""WCW Thunder"" June '99

vs. WWE European Champion Chris Jericho - This happened the night after WrestleMania as Eddie Guerrero was chasing after Chyna for weeks who also just happened to be Chris Jericho's associate as well. The match itself wasn't on the level of their past WCW & future WWE matches but still very competitive for what it was with both men going past paced & hitting some moves with heavy impact but this was all about the beginning of the ""Latino Heat"" character Eddie would have throughout his WWE career as far as his entertainment value from the pre-match promo & post match antics while also constantly making references towards ""mamacita"" Chyna.
""RAW"" Apr '00
[The Attitude Era]

vs. Matt Hardy - This was a King Of The Ring tournament qualifying match that saw Hardy attempt to work over the arm along with some unique moves like a tilt-a-wirl slam while Eddie relied on his lucha libre skills such as a frankensteiner along with having some counters to Hardy's trademark offense in a short but solid encounter.

No Disqualification Match vs. Edge - Both men started off aggressive with Eddie delievering punches pounding on Edge's face while Edge executed offense such as slams & flipping Eddie across the ring as both men continued to beat on each other with aggression from a top rope frankensteiner to a powerbomb before things got turned up even more with ladders & chairs coming into play being used not only as weapons but making their regular offense more impactful to the point where one man was left bleeding & more than just the participants being involved in the action resulting in a match that was so physical that the fans gave a standing ovation afterwords.
""SmackDown!"" Sept. '02
[Best Of SmackDown: 10th Anniversary]

Los Guerreros vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Team Angle - Both teams were evenly matched early on using mat wrestling & quick pin attempts before with one team using the strategy of singling out one opponent from his parter while having no issues taking a cheap shot at his partner & using illegal tactics behind the referee's back or on the floor only for their opponents to use the same tactics against them when the opportunity was available along with other's such as double teaming as the teams traded momentum to the point where it came down to which team was able to out-cheat the other to steal the win.

Royal Rumble '04

vs. WWE Champion Brock Lesnar - Brock was dominate early showcasing his power easily shoving Eddie down & knocking him out of the ring while also catching him when attempting offense & tossing him around with moves like the various release belly to belly suplexes before Eddie was able to neutralize Brock working over his leg causing Brock to change his strategy staying on the ground heavily working over the back while Eddie continued to focus on the leg with various strikes & submissions as they traded momentum with Brock just yelling for Eddie to ""JUST DIE!"" as they exchanged holds from the 3 Amigos to an F5 while someone else who had issues with one of the participants having karma for what he attempted to do during the match & earlier in the night come back to haunt him in what was one of the most emotional matches in not just the history of Eddie Guerrero but in WWE history.
No Way Out '04
[Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story]

WWE Championship Match vs. J.B.L. - J.B.L. did a pre-match promo (along with one earlier in the night) that had the crowd ready for Eddie to kill him as he took the match to the outside in the opening seconds fighting J.B.L. with whatever he could get his hands on from the ring post & steps to sending him over the announce table & choking him the camera cable as they continued to fight in the isleway before J.B.L. was able to return some of the punishment he took along with using his power to catch & toss Eddie around on the outside as they continued to fight back & forth with referees getting taken out in the process along with one of the loudest chairshots being delivered causing the match to evolved into one of the bloodiest brawls in history in what was a non-stop physical encounter.
Judgment Day '04

Steel Cage Match vs. WWE Champion J.B.L. - They started trading fist right away with J.B.L. trying to escape after every big offensive move only for Eddie to keep catching him delievering his trademark offense such as the 3 Amigos while J.B.L. used his power such as catching Eddie into moves like the fallaway slam as they traded momentum delievering big maneuvers from a superplex to the leg sweep off the top rope & one of the biggest frog splashes in history while using the cage as a weapon to throw their opponent into or have their own momentum used against them to send themselves in to the cage to the point where both men were fighting at the top of the cage at one point in what was another physical bout between both men.
""SmackDown!"" July '04
[Best Of SmackDown: 10th Anniversary]

vs. Kurt Angle - Mat wrestling was exchanged early with both men having the same idea in mind to work over the same area of the body using the same moves before using their different wrestling styles such as Angle delievering suplexes & grounding him with body scissors while Eddie used moves like head scissors takeover & frankensteiner along with attempting some ""lying & cheating & stealing"" as they traded momentum delievering their own trademark offense along with series of counters & reversals in what was an excellent wrestling match.
""SmackDown!"" Apr. '05

Steel Cage Match vs. Rey Mysterio - This was the final encounter of their feud throughout the entire year as they started brawling with Rey getting the upper hand only to realise the cage restricted him from doing some of his signature moves causing him to improvise as Eddie went after Rey with aggressive offense such as a powerbomb & leg sweep from the top rope as they traded momentum fighting at the top of the cage & both men going aerial at one point where one man sacrificed himself just to deliver a move off the top rope to his opponent on the top turnbuckle as it ultimately came down to one man making the ultimate sacrifice that didn't pay off allowing the other to capitalize.
""SmackDown!"" Sept. '05
[Best Of SmackDown: 10th Anniversary]

vs. World Champion Batista - Eddie had the advantage with this not only being in his home state of Texas but also his birthday as he was able to take Batista off his feet more than once before Batista showcased his superior strength not only slamming Eddie across the ring but also working over his back with repeated slams causing Eddie to try neutralizing Batista's power by heavily working over the back area with different submissions & strikes while also grounding & delievering impactful moves directly onto his back but kept having conflicts over weather to ""lie & cheat & steal"" as they continued to trade momentum throughout the rest of the contest until one man was able to catch the other in a solid encounter that not only told the story of Batista's power vs. Eddie's wrestling ability but also the story of Eddie having an internal conflict in regards to his ""lying & cheating & stealing.""
No Mercy '05
[Batista: I Walk Alone]

(Bonus) vs. Mr. Kennedy - This was to determine who would join Team SmackDown for the upcoming Survivor Series elimination match as Kennedy attempted to intimidate Eddie early by slapping him only for Eddie to have trademark response following by coming at him aggressively as they traded momentum with Kennedy using leverage to get the advantage in his favor only for Eddie to not only use his wrestling skills but also his ""lying & cheating & stealing"" tactics in what was a short average match but more memorable as it was Eddie's final televised performance.
""SmackDown!"" Nov. '05

DVD extras include Chris Jericho's story on meeting Eddie for the first time, the Los Guerreros vignettes & outtakes, and 2 hidden backstage segments with Chyna & Los Guerreros. Now there are 3 other versions of this set besides just the normal 3 disc set here available as Best Buy has this packaged with the No Way Out event where Eddie won the title, the ""Cheating Death, Stealing Life"" DVD set, and the RAW Tribute Show....FYE has this packaged with the SmackDown Tribute Show...and there is also another copy that contains the RAW & SD Tribute Shows but keep in mind that all Chris Benoit references, highlights, and his match vs. Triple H on the SmackDown show have been removed.

In the end, this is a great complimentary piece to Eddie's other DVD set that came out a while ago with some memorable matches, lost classics, and rare gems here. The only things I would have liked to seen was that ladder match he had with Tajiri vs. Team Angle at Judgment Day '03 that's heavily forgotten about, a better Ulitmo Dragon match or one of the tag matches with Chris Jericho that was talked about. Overall I would recommend this...and as a side note, I would also recommend Rey Mysterio's ""Biggest Little Man"" DVD to go along with this set too as it featured a handful of Guerrero's finest & classic performances against/with Mysterio as well.",1229644800,,19949,4.722493536340132
3531400,5,B001DJ7Q04,"This has to be one of the best sets the WWE has ever released. Every match on the set are appropriate and very good. Throughout the set you will hear from WWE superstars such as Dean Malenko, Ric Flair, Rey Mysterio, Chris Jericho, Edge, Mick Foley, JBL, Batista, John Cena, Jim Ross and a few others along with a few of Eddie's family memebers including his widow Vickie Guerrero, his brother Chavo Guerrero Sr., and his nephew Chavo Guerrero Jr. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about purchasing this release but I am very pleased and happy that I did. This is defiantely a great and perfect way to remember the late great Eddie Guerrero!

Disc 1
ECW Hardcore TV 4.8.1995
ECW World TV Title
Vs. 2 Cold Scorpio
Even though Ecw is known for their harcore matches, this was a good wrestling match. Scorpio was wrestling with an injured shoulder but he doesn't give up one bit. Very good match with a sudden end. 4/5

ECW Hostile City Showdown 4.15.1995
ECW World TV Title
Vs. Dean Malenko
These matches like this is what I think was the heart of ECW. This was just a fantastic wrestling match. Just a great match. Much better than the one from WCW. 4.5/5

Starrcade 12.27.1995
Vs. Shinjiro Otani
Starrcade '95 was hosting the joint production of the New Japan vs. WCW and this was one of the matches from that ppv. In my opinion this match is probably the best one from disc 1. Great aerial moves by both Eddie & Otani. Great back and forth competition. Just a terrific match. 4.75/5

Hog Wild 8.10.1996
United States Title
Vs. Ric Flair
The match was more for entertainment value than anything else. But Flair and Eddie managed to have a good wrestling match along with the entertainment. A good match between the Dirtiest Player in the Game and Latino Heat. 4/5

SuperBrawl 2.23.1997
United States Title
Vs. Chris Jericho
Jericho and Eddie delivered a solid match up. Great counters and reversals. Good solid action from both men. A great competitive wrestling match right here. 4.5/5

WCW Nitro 11.10.1997
Cruiserweight Title
Vs. Rey Mysterio
To be honest this match really disappointed me. It was alright but WWE could have chosen a better match between these two to put right here. Good thing that their WWE title match from Smackdown made up for it. 3.5/5

Starrcade 12.28.1997
Cruiserweight Title
Vs. Dean Malenko
Malenko and Eddie has had way better matches then this. This was a good match but not as good as their ECW encounter and their other WCW encounters. A pretty good match nevertheless though. 4.25/5

Slamboree 5.17.1998
Vs. Ultimo Dragon
This match was for Chavo Guerrero's ""freedom"" from his uncle Eddie. The match went at a good pace with some good aerial movneuvers. It had a pretty good ending too. Pretty good match. 3.75/5

WCW Nitro 8.3.1998
Vs. Juventud Guerrera
With this match being on Nitro, it was a little bit too short. However the match did have a few nice spots. Very fast paced match with a good ending. 3.5/5

WCW Thunder 6.24.1999
Vs. Psychosis
This was Eddie's return match after he was injured from a car accident. The match itself was very good. Some great inring work along with some good action on the outside. I thought this match was very good. Pretty strong frog splash at the end also. 4/5

Disc 2
Raw 4.3.2000
European Title
Vs. Chris Jericho
This match happened the night after Wrestlemania and this was the beginning of Eddie becoming ""Latino Heat"". This was a good match. Nothing bad to say about this one except it just wasn't as good as their other bout from the first disc. Good in it's own right though. 3.5/5

Smackdown 6.8.2000
Vs. Matt Hardy
This was a King of the Ring qualifying match that happened on Smackdown. A little bit short of a match but it was pretty average. 3.25/5

Backlash 4.21.2002
Intercontinental Title
Vs. Rob Van Dam
This was the battle of the frog splashes. Me myself was very curious in who would pull off their frog splash first. The match was vintage RVD with good high flying action from both men. Some good counters. A very good match. I really enjoyed this one. 4/5

Raw 4.29.2002
Intercontinental Title
Vs. Jeff Hardy
Another good match for the IC title. Hardy of course was using his high flying, unorthodox style in the match. Eddie was pretty sharp as well. This too was a great match for the IC title. 4/5

Smackdown 9.26.2002
No Disqualification
Vs. Edge
This match here with Edge was the conclusion in their 2 month feud they were having at the time. Both Eddie and Edge were using the ladders they brought into the match very effectively along with a chair. The Edgeacution from the ladder was very sick. Eddie gets an ovation after the match. Watch out for the ref getting hit with the ladder by Edge. 4.5/5

Backlash 4.27.2003
WWE Tag Team Titles
Los Guerreros vs. Team Angle
This was a damn good tag team match. One of the bests I have ever seen. Even though the Guerrero's were known for ""lyin', cheatin', & stealin'"" Team Angle was usig those same tactics against Eddie and Chavo. The match had very good ring work with some good double teaming. An awesome tag team bout. A terrific match. 4.75/5

Smackdown 9.11.2003
Latino Heat Parking Lot Brawl
Vs. John Cena
Before anything, Cena did cut a pretty good rap before the match happened. As the match went, it was pretty good and especially for being the first of it's kind. Some hard shots were taken into the windshields and the windows of the cars. That frogsplash from the top of the van onto Cena was just phenomenal. A good street fight. 3.5/5

Royal Rumble 1.25.2004
Vs. Chavo Guerrero
Defiantely a vintage Guerrero match. Eddie was at his usual here with Chavo doing his best to hang in there aganist his uncle Eddie. An one of a kind confrontation from the Guerreros. A strong match from Eddie and Chavo. 4/5

No Way Out 2.15.2004
WWE Title
Vs. Brock Lesnar
Any fan of Eddie's or just wrestling period needs to see this match. His matches with Kurt Angle and this one right here with Eddie, Brock Lesnar was at his best. Just a fantastic and grueling match. Eddie and Brock had a superb showing. This was a classic bout. Awesome match. 5/5

Disc 3
Smackdown 3.18.2004
WWE Title
Vs. Rey Mysterio
This match with Rey Rey far past their previous match against each other on this set. Rey and Eddie(particularly Rey) was just laying it all on the line. This match is defiantley one of the bests in Smackdown's history. Both pulled out very good counters on each other. A little bit of high risk as well. A great showing from both Eddie and Rey. A spectactuler match. 5/5

Judgment Day 5.16.2004
WWE Title
Vs. John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield
Before I say anything, this is one of the most bloodiest bouts in the WWE's history and also I felt this match was pretty damn good as well. But the heart that Eddie showed after being busted open was just off the charts. Eddie showed splended heart in this match. This match was just a straight up fight though. JBL was at his best in this match I believe too. The chaos after the match was good as well. But the heart from Eddie is what I loved the most about this match. 4.5/5

Smackdown 7.15.2004
WWE Title (Steel Cage Match)
Vs. John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield
This steel cage match with JBL was pretty good. But it mostly was here to renew Eddie's rivalry with Kurt Angle. It had a couple of good spots with the cage. A little bit of high risk as well. That frogsplash from the top of the cage was just out of this world. Not a bloody cage match but it is a good one. 4/5

Smackdown 4.14.2005
Vs. Kurt Angle
This match with Kurt was from the WWE championship series chase to challenge John Cena for the title. Eddie looked very good and so did Angle but not as good as from Wrestlemania 21. Angle is just a fantastic mat wrestler though and Eddie is good all around. Just a very, very, very great match. 4.5/5

Smackdown 9.9.2005
Steel Cage Match
Vs. Rey Mysterio
I wasn't all too pleased with this cage match. It had a couple of exciting and good spots but nothing really that caught my attention. But this match belonged here. This was an interesting match though especially for Rey since he couldn't use his 619 or other high flying offense. A good match but not all that good. 3.5/5

No Mercy 10.9.2005
World Heavyweight Title
Vs. Batista
This wasn't the greatest wrestling match in Eddie's career but it was alright. This was during the time where Eddie was trying to change his ""lyin', cheatin', & stealin'"" ways. Batista's back takes some harsh punishment from Eddie. This being Eddie's final ppv match, it had some justice to it. Not Eddie's best match but I think it was one of Batista's best. 4/5

The Extra's contains a couple of Eddie's vignettes along with Chavo, Chris Jericho telling how himself and Eddie met for the first time, and Eddie's final match.

Eddie's Final Match
Smackdown 11.11.2005
Vs. Mr. Kennedy
This match had vintage Eddie Guerrero's ""lyin', cheatin', & stealin'"" antics. Not a great match but a great way to see Eddie's last time in the square circle. 3.5/5

I strongly suggest any fan of wrestling to pick this up. This set is a great way to see the history of Latino Heat, Eddie Guerrro. Rest In Peace Eddie(1967-2005). We sure miss you Eddie. Viva La Raza!",1227139200,13,9188,4.579171741778319
3531401,5,B001DJ7Q04,"I have to admit, this new WWE set is probably the best they've put out this year! Very little I could find wrong with it. Here, we get to hear from Dean Malenko, Jim Ross, ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair (prior to his leaving WWE), Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio, Chavo Guerrero and his father Chavo, Sr., The Hardyz, John Cena, Edge, JBL, Jerry Lawler, Michael Cole and of course Eddie's widow Vickie Guerrero.

Here are the matches and my view of them. I will say that they rank from okay to excellent! In my opinion, there isn't one sucky match on this release:

Disc 1

Vs. 2 Cold Scorpio (ECW World TV Title Match) - In his first bout in the U.S., Eddie takes on the very underrated 2 Cold Scorpio in a back and forth match that sees Eddie win his first major title in America after Scorpio makes the mistake of letting Eddie up when he has him beat!

Vs. Dean Malenko (ECW World TV Title Match) - The first of many encounters in both ECW and WCW between these two. This one goes to a time limit draw after several near falls near the end!

Vs. Shinjiro Otani (Starrcade '95) - This was part of the WCW Vs. New Japan Best of Seven series for the World Cup. This featured New Japan stars such as Tenzan, Mr. Saito, Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger, Masa Chono and Kensuki Sasaki (Power Warrior) and WCW stars such as Johnny B. Badd, Chris Benoit, Lex Luger, Sting, ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage and Guerrero.

Of all the bouts, this one was probably the best of the them. I felt that way even back then in 1995 and I still feel that way now. An incredible bout!

Vs. ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair w/Ms. Elizabeth and Woman (Nancy Benoit)(WCW U.S. Title Match) - This was from WCW Hog Wild in 1996 and saw Eddie take on the legendary Ric Flair for the U.S. belt. While he would fall to Flair here, Guerrero would later win this very title in a tournament beating Diamond Dallas Page in the finals.

Back to this match, a very good matchup that saw Guerrero's own finisher (The Frog Splash) actually cost him the match as he hurt his leg on impact! Flair took advantage with his figure four with an assist from the ropes and Woman to get the win!

Vs. Chris Jericho (WCW U.S. Title Match) - This was at SuperBrawl '97 and was actually a very good bout but the crowd was very DEAD in this match. Sad because these two were putting on a wrestling clinic but work rate and such wasn't as appreciated in that era as it is now. Guerrero retained by the way.

Vs. Rey Mysterio (WCW Cruiserweight Title Match) - This was on WCW Nitro and was a rematch from their legendary Halloween Havoc '97 bout! This one wasn't as good but I can't recall ever seeing a bad match between Guerrero and Mysterio. Guerrero avenges his loss to Rey and regains the Cruiserweight title.

Vs. Dean Malenko (WCW Cruiserweight Title Match) - This was on the undercard of Sting Vs. Hulk Hogan at Starrcade '97 (ugh!) and quite frankly, this one along with Saturn VS. Benoit, DDP Vs. Curt ""Mr. Perfect"" Hennig and Zybysco Vs. Eric Bischoff for control of Nitro saves this card from being total buttcrack!

Anyway, back to this match, while nowhere near the quality of their ECW battles or early WCW matches, this one is a good one to open up the card. Guerrero wins after a Frog Splash to Malenko's injured leg!

Vs. Ultimo Dragon - This could've been a classic but the angle of Eddie Vs. Chavo took away from this bout. I will say this one was okay.

Vs. Juventud Guerrera - A short but fast paced bout during Juvi's hot streak in WCW that saw him lose very little. Eddie was one of those losses.

Vs. Psychosis - This was a revenge bout after Psychosis turned on Eddie for breaking up the Latino World Order (LWO). In reality, the angle was dropped because Eddie had injured himself in a car wreck. This is actually discussed prior to the match by his widow Vickie.

The match itself wasn't a classic but it was pretty good. Probably excellent considering the shape WCW was in by that point! Eddie wins with his Frog Splash.

Disc 2

Vs. Chris Jericho (WWE European Title Match) - This took place a few days after WrestleMania 2000. Surprisingly, the commentary hasn't been edited as Chris Jericho's Triple Threat bout with Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit is mentioned! I should also note that Benoit's name comes up in the color commentary of some of the other Eddie matches on this release too. Thumbs up to WWE for that! I am not a fan of the man anymore but I hate history being edited even worse!

Back to the match, Eddie wins with a surprise assist from Chyna who actually accompanied Jericho to this bout! From there, ""Latino Heat"" begins!

Vs. Matt Hardy - This was a qualifying match in the 2000 edition of The King Of The Ring Tournament. Very good match that sees ""Latino Heat"" win cleanly despite being a heel at this point!

Vs. Rob Van Damn (WWE Intercontinental Title Match) - Excellent match! This one was only surpassed by their now classic Ladder match later that year. As for this one, it ends when Eddie hits his Frog Splash after a neckbreaker onto the championship belt!

Vs. Jeff Hardy (WWE Intercontinental Title Match) - A good match between Jeff and Eddie that saw a lot of high impact on both men! Eddie wins this match.

Vs. Edge (No DQ Match) - This was the end of a series between Edge and Guerrero. This not only shows the heart of Guerrero but shows why Edge is the star he is now! Very physical encounter and while weapons are used, they are used sparringly. Ends when Edge gets his ""Edgecution"" (super DDT) from the top of a ladder! Fans cheer both men when the match is over. I've never seen their Unforgiven 2002 match but I have seen their SummerSlam 2002 and I have to say this one defintely beats their SS match!

Vs. Team Angle (WWE Tag Team Title Match) - By this time, Los Guerreros had been formed with Eddie and Chavo as they looked to regain their tag belts from Team Angle's Shelton Benjammin and Charlie Haas (who would go on to become The World's Greatest Tag Team). Ends when Benjamin trips up Chavo as he attempted a suplex on Haas and holds the feet down to allow Haas to get the win. In classic Los Guerrero fashion though, they steal the belts despite being the losers and ride off in their low-rider! LOL!

Vs. John Cena (Parking Lot Brawl) - If ever a case was to be made that they should turn John Cena back into a heel, then here it is! He was hilarious in his diss rap prior to this bout and, in my view, he was a lot rougher than he is now!

Back to the match, I have to say OUCH! on some of the bumps they took! I won't tell you the ending of this one other than to say Eddie had some b*lls!

Vs. Chavo Guerrero - This was from the Royal Rumble 2004 and while a decent bout, it isn't their best by no means. The excitement picks up after the match though.

Vs. Brock Lesner (WWE World Title Match) - This is from No Way Out 2004 and anyone that even consider themselves a fan MUST see this match! This is what made Eddie go from great performer to legend in my view because Brock (like him or not) was nearly unbeatable at this point! While there is some interference from Goldberg, it actually affected the outcome of this bout very little. The celebration afterwards is what lives in my mind even today!

Also, this disc has some Los Guerreros Vignettes.

Disc 3

Vs. Rey Mysterio (WWE Title Match) - This one was a surprise because I never knew these guys went at it for the WWE title! A very good match between these two and another classic.

Vs. JBL (WWE Title Match) - This is from Judgement Day 2004 and I have to say the last 10 mintues or so of this bout has to be the BLOODIEST I've ever seen! You want to talk bloodbath?! You must see this one! I might be wrong but this one gives both Brock Vs. Undertaker and Cena Vs. JBL competition in terms of bleeding!

Back to the match, it wasn't a wrestling classic but a good old fashioned fight! Even after the match was over, they were still going at it. Its amazing Eddie, with all that blood loss, didn't pass on that night! I really mean that!

Vs. JBL (WWE Title Match) - This one was in a cage and by that point, JBL had taken the title from Guerrero. In this one, we see a spetacular Frog Splash from the top of the cage when Guerrero had the chance to win the match! After that, Eddie still could've won but thanks to Kurt Angle, JBL retained.

Vs. Kurt Angle - This one was part of the WWE Championship series to see who would face then champion John Cena at Judgement Day 2005. I will say that this match was better than their WM 20 encounter in my view! Ends when an argument between Rey Mysterio and Guerrero gives Angle the opening to hit Guerrero with a chair to get the pin.

Vs. Rey Mysterio - This one was in a cage and the angle was that Eddie was obssessed with defeating Rey Mysterio and had been unable to do so in their recent series of matches. Eddie finally gets a win over Rey after a missed splash from Mysterio and a Frog Splash from Eddie! This wasn't as good as their WCW encounters or their Ladder Match at SummerSlam 2005 but, as I said, I never saw a bad match from these two.

Vs. Batista - In their first and only PPV square off, Guerrero gave Batista very good match. Though Dave B. was the face here, most of the cheers were for Guerrero! Ends when Eddie misses his Frog Splash and Batista counters with his spinebuster for the win.

This disc also has a short story on how Chris Jericho first met Eddie and Eddie's final match against Mr. Kennedy. It isn't a great one but it is rather funny! LOL!

Overall, I would highly recommend this release from WWE and for those that are upset that Chris Benoit isn't on here, I say get over it on this one. I never thought I'd say that but his absence on this release taints it a little but not enough to bring it down though I do find it funny that they don't have Chris but many of their recent releases (especially Austin's and this one) has Nancy in them? I think her family would have a case for royalties possibly.

Back to this release, I would recommend getting this along with ""Cheating Death, Stealing Life"" as that one still does have Benoit on it and has matches that are not on this release save his title win over Brock Lesner.

Viva La Raza Eddie! Rest In Peace!",1226793600,11,10205,4.299791449426486
3531402,2,B001DJ7Q04,"I went out to go purchase both exclusive FYE and Best Buy DVD sets so I could get both tribute shows for Eddie that wasn't combined together. The Best Buy exclusive has a nice collectors tin at $39.99, that also holds Eddie's ""Cheating Death, Stealing Life"" dvd as well as No Way Out 2004 where Eddie won the title, and of course the Raw Tribute show. It would've made sense to just add the Smackdown tribute to this set as this was packaged nicely at a higher value. I could've done without the No Way out 2004 dvd in exchange for the Smackdown tribute show, since the Viva La Raza dvd already holds the No Way Out title match on the set.

Now onto the dvd itself. Like other reviews, the match listings are all the same. There are some matches that were put on the disc from the year 2000, which was a great year, though it puts a damper on things because of the blurred scratched logos, which just really decreases the value on WWE footage. The vignettes are ok, but seeing that they were already on the Cheating Death Stealing Life dvd, there was no need for these. I would've loved if they would've added the vignette where Eddie tries to barge into the playboy mansion because Chyna was inside, or alot of the other great vignettes or promos that Eddie had cut. Other than that, everything else was good.

The tribute shows were packaged separately into cardboard slip covers, which luckily mine weren't all scratched up. They did this with the SummerSlam Anthology box set. Enough is enough with this nonsense packaging. Raw's tribute show is edited, so don't expect to see Benoit in it. They also cut his match with Triple H. I could understand why, but they should've just left it how it was.  Stefanie McMahon was also cut from her Remembering Eddie segment.  They edited interviews adding clips while a certain wrestler was speaking. The matches are all great, but I've decided to give this set a two star, (because of the purchase of two separate sets to get the tributes, the bad packaging of the tributes, and editing of the tributes.",1226448000,4,2048,4.542005420054201
