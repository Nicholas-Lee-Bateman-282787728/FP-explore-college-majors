8495557,5,B0069WJJ2I,"A great intro for a quick overview of Israeli/Palestinian conflict based on the shared city of Jerusalem. The documentary is dated (now almost 20 years), and Jennings himself died in 2005.  Still, this humanizes the sides in a way that few other documentaries have.  He does not play favorites, and largely lets the guests speak for themselves.  Several guests say things that push viewers away, but not because of biased editing.  The statements made are out of their own mouths.  It isn't scathing or scintillating.  It is real journalism.",1457568000,,541,5.022471910112359

8495559,5,B0069WJJ2I,"Many years ago I saw this video that I borrowed from a colleague  and showed it to a few of my college classes. The image of the families with the long, long paper scroll with names and dates of those who owned the property still stays with me.  I think it is one of the most powerful ways to give us a ""sense"" of what having a homeland can mean to a person.  I really wish ABC, or better PBS, would show this again, with an update!",1406073600,,432,3.942528735632184
8495560,5,B0069WJJ2I,"I had seen and recorded (on VHS) this program when it first aired. Somewhere along the way I gave away my video collection and have always wanted another copy of it. The climax of the film, to me, is of course, the old man who comes out at dawn to speak his prophecy. This still puts chillbumps up my spine! And, I pray, his prophetic words are true.",1403481600,,350,4.161764705882353

8495562,5,B0069WJJ2I,"A colleague told me about this video and for only $16 I picked one up right away.  The video is only about 50 minutes long but does a very good job of showing the conflict in Jerusalem.  It highlights the 3 monotheistic religions in the city (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) and explains each of their claims to the city.  It does focus more on the conflict between Jews and Muslims (but seeing how these are the two main groups fighting it makes sense).  There are some unexpected and candid interviews but that adds to the Jerusalem Stories experience.

I teach high school freshmen and they were very engaged with this video, especially when asked ""who should rule Jerusalem?""  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn (or teach) more about this topic!",1361836800,,768,4.6940298507462686
