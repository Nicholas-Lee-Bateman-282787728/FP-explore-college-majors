8616639,3,B00FL64DXI,"Ann's art work is beautiful, but for me, I could not follow her instructions or process--she may have assumed some previous knowledge on the part of her audience--maybe I just need to watch it several more times and slow it down so I can try to grasp what she is doing and how she is doing it.  Her work as I said above is beautiful but I couldn't even get contact paper to work very well.  Anyway, if you are an advanced or maybe intermediate multi-media artist you can get some terrific tips here, but I may have to donate my copies.  I do get the concept of layers, though!",1420156800,2,576,4.218181818181818
8616640,5,B00FL64DXI,"Ann is a terrific teacher and very easy to listen to.
I do quite a lot of printing but this DVD got me to another level entirely - more art than scrapping.",1410220800,4,155,3.875
