1383368,5,B00004Z4WS,"This movie surprised me more than any movie that I have ever bought without knowing it's history. The director did a great job with showing the effects of the drugs on the characters by mixing in daydream scenes throughout the movie. The characters are fantastic! They jump out and greet you like normal people. The whole movie would be fun without sound or with sound but no picture. I don't know why I had never heard of this film before, but I am very happy that I know now.",978652800,3,477,4.370786516853933
1383369,4,B00004Z4WS,"I first heard about the movie when I was reading an article on DJ sensation Sasha, on a sidebar about things going on in the dance scene. He indicated that the the movie would probably do the same things for ecstasy culture as ""Trainspotting"" had done for heroin culture. I loved ""Trainspotting"" because of the quirky dialogue that occured between the film's witty, cynical, and outrageous characters, so I was really looking forward to this one.
Right off the bat you get a feel for who the characters are in this movie, a sort of familiarizing and ""getting used to"" the fun loudness that is played to perfection by each member of the cast. One aspect that I found particularly interesting is the way the personal problems each person was experiencing in their lives was blown up large scale in their own minds, in their own scenes, that both explained and justified how they would act later in the film. Problems such as sexual performance, trust in your partner, a feeling of ""loosing it"", and even the media's view of clubbers and the embarrasing fashion in which partygoers sometimes present themselves to the outside world. Although there is empathy and concern on the part of the friends involved in relation to the problems each individual character has, they in no way match in comparison to the torture created in the characters' own minds.
Another thing about the movie that I enjoyed is the way it can be easy to relate to each one of the outlandish characters in terms of the fears and inhibitions they have about everyday life. The characters, for the most part, are incredibly unhappy with their work lives, and anxiously await for the weekend to arrive and bring an end to the misery that is the reality of their daily lives.
The movie, quite simply, was brilliant...just a joy to watch. The characters are ones that have been performed to the point where its fun to look back and remember the adventures and frolicks of the characters themselves, not just certain scenes of a movie where a character would have his/her funny line, do a funny stunt, or otherwise only have a small and unimportant impact in the movie itself.",976665600,7,2140,4.724598930481283
1383370,5,B00004Z4WS,"Before seeing this film I (like many others, come on, admit it) passed it off as Trainspotting Lite, which it still kind of is, but it is also far more enjoyable and watchable as it is far more fun. (I'm not saying it's a better film, but it is more fun)
Trainspotting showed the deadly consequenses of Drug us in a realistic and frightening way. Human traffic shows some consequences, but they are comical consequences. It never delves into the drug scene like Trainspotting, Human Traffic settles on taking on the Rave scene.
The young British cast of unknowns give the film their all and there isn't one bad performer among them, they all have the ability to go very, very far indeed. The debut writer/director Justin Kerrigan shows he has tremendous skills in both fields. Like Guy Ritchie before him, his writing/directing is snappy and fast paced giving the audience barely time to blink.
Fans of anything British will probably find something they like in this film, I believe everyone of Earth should be able to. (well.. Age's 15 through 50 at least)",974764800,4,1057,4.75

It's about a bunch of kids having boring low-life jobs, just waiting for the weekend to come, and the drugs to take effects. What I really liked about this movie was that all the actors looked like people you actually could meet in real-life, and they all acted brilliant. The filming is also brilliant, and it's very intelligent too. Yes, I really love this movie!",969580800,2,456,4.440476190476191

1383374,5,B00004Z4WS,HUMAN TRAFFIC is a light comedy with great music and it hasn't got a mean bone in it.  It has swearing and recreational drug use so it is not for the immature.

1383375,5,B00004Z4WS,"Human Traffic is easily a top 5 movie of mine since it was released in 2000, It capture how fun and exciting UK Club Culture can be, being a Dj I might have a broader appreciation for this movie, its like comfort food or visiting an old friend who you love, a fun ride every time even after the 50th viewing, ""Koop, Moff, Jip, Nina and Lu Lu are characters you would love to Club with no matter how dysfunctional they may be"". Pete Tong (UK Dj) put together an amazing Soundtrack of Classic Dance Anthems of that time period (all of which still hold up well today), this movie is a raw, gritty, funny, high energy, realistic view of the UK Club Culture in the same way Trainspotting was about UK Junkie Life Styles, I don't condone drug use, but it is an unfortunate part of the UK Club Culture, that's only a small part of this movie. One weekend in the lives of some really like able characters, a journey you should experience at least once. I'll leave you with a quote from Moff(Danny Dyer from BBC Skins and the Movie Doghouse): ""I'm having the best time, when I'm off my pickle and feeling the music, you know what I mean ?, crusty, I knew you wouldn't let me down, I knew it !"".",1293494400,,1185,4.247787610619469
1383376,5,B00004Z4WS,"Films that vividly capture a time and place are exceptionally rare. Couple this with films that stand the test of time, and you are talking only a handful of films.
Having seen this film 5 times over a decade, I can honestly say it does both and should be considered the last great film of the 20th Century (and the best film to come out of Britain in the late 90's).

Covering a weekend with 4 young Welsh clubbers, this film has often been compared to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Go/dp/0767835093/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Go</a>&nbsp;as it is one of those movies about having fun that steers well clear of cheesiness and pretensiousness & instead still seems to define the British club scene. No other film you will find (with the possible exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Hour-Party-People/dp/B0000DK4RL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24 Hour Party People</a>) better captures what a night or weekend clubbing is like & the soundtrack is up there with the very best.

Onto the plot. The plot is fairly simple, but explores some interesting themes.
Firstly we have Jip & his problems with 'Mr Floppy' (use your imagination with this one!)
Then there is Koop, who is also sexually paranoid, but in the different sense of being over-protective of his flirtatious girlfriend.
Next there is Lulu, who constantly goes out with cheating partners & Nina (girlfriend of Koop) and harassed by her boss at work.
Lastly there is Moff (played by the Danny Dyer in one of his best performances) who is by far the most memorable character of the film, being as he is one of those people who exist in every group of friends - the alienated, fun-loving wastrel.

The Five decide to go out in Cardiff for a weekend of 'pubs, clubs, drugs and parties', in which drug culture, alienation & the dark side of relationships are explored in depth. Coupled with this, there is also the lighter side, with Love, laughter & youth creating some of the best, most iconoclastic scenes that you will see in any movie.

If you ever need popular culture references concerning the various odd things that can occur on a night out, this is the first place to come.
As an example, there is the 'spliff politics' scene, in which&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howard-Marks/dp/B003JDCT54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howard Marks</a>&nbsp;narrates a scene where a spliff is being shared round the room & each charactor is trying their best to gain the attention of the man with spliff so that they'll be passed it next.
There is also an interesting scene of two older clubbers discussing how 'the scene isn't what it used to be' and how everyone isn't as open & friendly as it was 'in the good old days' (before they react in a highly unfriendly manner to a stranger who sits down next to them!)

Anyhow, I could continue for hours telling you how fantastic this film is but I'm guessing (if you've seen this film before) it will be known to you and (if you haven't seen it) then long descriptions won't persuade you.
What I will say is this: if you want a film that always provides you with new & interesting insights into popular culture & why people still 'rave' about 90's dance (pardon the pun), then there is no better film than this to try.
And if you've really seen your fill of this film, then I can only recommend the soundtrack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-Traffic/dp/B00006I8W5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human Traffic</a>) & that you see either the two films above or two other contemporary classics in the form of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Late-Night-Shopping/dp/B00005AFLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Late Night Shopping</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/East-Is-East/dp/B00004UCHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">East Is East</a>.

Is the club scene dead? Not as long as films like this survive...

Don't get me wrong, I've only seen the American release and love it, but I was looking for the UK one so I could see the deleted scenes and hear the actual references to British culture.  Needless to say if someone can point me to the real 99-minute UK release of this movie, I'd greatly appreciate it.",1282694400,3,568,4.1454545454545455

It isn't a complex film but you feel part of the build up, part of the craziness and the slow comedown at the end. It even takes the odd pot shot at the drug culture that makes up the core of this film. The whole soundtrack is fantastic and seems to pick up on the moods so well. Finally it manages to pull out all those great and pointless thoughts and conversations you have on a night out that make that always seem spot on! A film that for better or worse will always have pride of place in my collection.",1143676800,3,664,3.962686567164179

Amazon's review is so off the mark you have to wonder if he actually watched the film.  ""Human Traffic"" is so on the mark you'd have to be an idiot not to enjoy it.  ""HT"" and ""Trainspotting"" have absolutely nothing in common, and in no way should they be compared.  Just because they're both European films doesn't mean they're trying to be the same movie.  That's like saying ""Saving Private Ryan"" wasn't funny compared to ""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot"" becasue they're both American movies(Although ""SOMMWS"" was lame to begin with).  Check out this movie, even if you're not familiar wtih the culture you should laugh your buns off.  Also if you like this movie check out the directors new movie ""It's All Gone Pete Tong"" just as god of a movie, not as scary as ""28 Days Later"" though, cause that was british too.",1137369600,9,928,4.587878787878788

1383391,5,B00004Z4WS,"...then you will appreciate this movie. If you have ever been a raver, club kid, or dj, you will be able to connect with these characters. Even if you haven't, this will give you a glimpse into the lives of those that have. From trying to get tickets to a sold out event, to meeting your crew before the night begins for the pre-show cocktails, to the after-after party at someone's house with the inevitable stoned 'Star Wars' discussions, this is the most true-to-life portrayal of the club scene that I have ever seen in a movie. Like most club kids, the characters are obsessed with the music that they go in search of every weekend. It is their common bond, and it has made a tight circle of friends that only music can create.

Yet, the movie is creative, too. It's not just a story of a bunch of kids going out for a night at a Cardiff club; it's also about how Kip, and Lulu, who have been close friends for quites some time now, and how they are destined to be with each other. It's about people who have terrible jobs and impressionable siblings. It's about realizing that maybe you do too many drugs.

Visually, it's great too; creative editing and interesting storytelling make for something different than most of the other rave-esque movies out there.

Adding to that sense of realism, the music here has been chosen and produced by Rob Mello, who is considered a legend in the underground house music scene that this movie is portraying. That addition makes it that much more believable to those watching.

That said, since this is a movie about a scene that is different from mainstream clubbing, some might not get it, and therefore not appreciate it. As I said though, if you are familiar with this type of culture, you'll love this movie.",1102464000,9,1757,4.550632911392405

Any one who has experienced the substance ecstasy will totaly and instantly relate to this movie !!!! The one liners in this film are perfect and again if you have used ecstasy you will totaly know what i mean. The club scene is brilliant the after party is so accurately done to the next mornings absolute emotional breackdown ...

Friends of mine had me sit down and watch the movie with them, everyone single one of them could relate to the film in one way or another, from the drugs and alcohol and the crazy nights in the clubs, to the jobs that each character in the film is trying to escape.
The film follows young people from all over Britian to a crazed weekend that drastically constrast their drab everyday lives.  From the scenes that show the jobs by choreographing mechanical movements in a very stylistic way to the free moving scenes of the clubs, bars and parties each attends.  One thing that makes the movie acting ever more real is that the actors who were cast were asked if they had ever done drugs, each had so they knew how to relate to the scenes.
All in all, the movie is well directed and well acted.  The scenes are put together to create an extremely original, creative and oddly realistic movie which, anyone who has every partied in Britian, can relate to.",1074902400,2,1037,4.357512953367876

I guess some people cant stand honesty when it comes to drugs, but this movie is not a preachy moralistic tale about the 'youth of today', its about a group of mates going out on a Friday night, an amazing night, insightful humor that produces more than one ""oh my gaaaaaaaahhhhhdddd THATS ME!!!"" from people,combined with a gritty reality that is so lacking in todays films.
My only critique is that some idiot thought it would be a good idea to edit out all the drug references for the US version.
Not to mention this makes for a far shorter movie (heh), it really looses the point in some bits (not to mention creeeepy).

1383398,5,B00004Z4WS,"Bret Fetzer's got it all wrong. ""Human Traffic"" is an irreverent and artistic look at the late-90s rave scene, as similarly depicted in films such as ""Go"" and ""Groove."" While it's likely that audiences above forty will find this film offensive, those of us slapped with the ""Gen-X"" title can sit back, nod knowingly and appreciate the movie's brilliant candor and honesty.
Unlike Hollywood films, Brit filmmakes are decidedly more comfortable with tackling the taboo, and in ""Human Traffic,"" the audience is treated to a non-partisan perspective on drug-culture. The film is neither for nor against it; it merely lays it all out on the table and lets the viewer decide.
This is not to say that ""Human Traffic"" presents both sides equally. The characters in this film are having way too much fun to seriously consider slowing down, and thus far have faced few repurcussions due to their partying. It's this portrayal that will undoubtedly ruffle feathers and cause some to believe that this is a pro-drug film. It's not--but neither is it a statement against recreational drug use. Actually, it's a sly wink to those of us who have survived the party and still kind of miss it. ;)

The only attitude they have is that they're trying to make sense of everyday reality and when you're in your early 20's, things are not always peachy keen. Brett is the epitome of what these 4 friends are trying to escape from. Free your mind Brett. Have you ever gone out to a club and felt absolutely carried away by the music? Have you ever danced for 4 hours straight? Have you ever experienced the beauty and stillness of a sunrise with your closet friends? Have you ever fallen in love with your best friend? Obviously not, otherwise the movie would have touched you greatly. Instead you just chuck in the ""Trainspotting"" category. Stupid. The only 3 things this movie has in common with Trainspotting: There are drugs. There is techno. It's set in Great Britain. That's it. Maybe I was spoiled club kid, but at the time (90-92), the only thing I had to look forward to in my bleak life as a college freshman was the weekend and going to dance parties with my best mates. Every weekend was a bonding experience and I'll never forget those times. This movie is a scrapbook for the acidhouse genration, told humanly and accurately, with a fanastic soundtrack (thank you Pete Tong!)
So Brett, you missed the boat, mate and I feel sorry for you.",1028505600,34,1666,4.538205980066445

if you have ever been out clubbing, or just out with a group of friends you will love this film.
The acting is amazing!  if you have ever been clubbing and taken part in what happens at clubs you will relate to the characters straight away!
i don't know if the clubbing scene is the same in America, but being British this touches home on so many issues!

Some of the scenes are absolute classics,particularly 'the star wars speech' its the kind of film you never tire of watching because it parodies the kind of people who you know.this is what modern uk 'club culture' is like and if your a part of it,or at least understand it,that gives you a right to comment,if not,WATCH IT,YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING.TRUST ME ,ITS BRILLIANT!",1012694400,3,838,4.786206896551724

""Someone"" states that the plot revolves around getting into a particular club, that is only one of the ancillary events of the actual plot, which revolves around the club scene, and the relationships and growth between the friendships of this band of clubbers.  This movie takes advantage of the phrase ""It would be soo funny if they did ::this:: right now,"" by actually doing ::this::, leading to hysterical scenes that are intended to show the inner workings of things we don't often think about, in hyperbolic and ridiculous tones.

1383409,3,B00004Z4WS,"As of this evening I have seen both versions; the UK version and the US version. The former absolutely rocks. It is the closest to a great night out clubbing that you are likely to see on the screen.
Anyone who has ever gone out clubbing will appreciate the UK version of this film. For example, the scene where Felix is chatting with another spaced out clubber about how it is not as good as it used to be. I found this scene hilarious and the flashback to 1991 even more so. On the whole Human Traffic is one of the best ""rave"" (read: not completely anti-drugs) movies ever.
Now the bad news. This flashback scene, and many more like it, are completely MISSING from the US version. I don't know why the distributors think that the US audience are so tender and impressionable that they cannot handle such satire and wit. Regardless, US audiences are sadly deprived from a great piece of cinema. The edit has, in my opinion, spoiled the flow of the movie.
I'm not bitter, really! It's still a fantastic film, even surviving the American edit without completely disappointing. I suggest that you flip the proverbial bird to the distributors here in the US and get it from the source in the UK. (Of course you will need a region-free DVD player, plus multi-standard TV)
As a poor substitute you might want to check out ""Groove"", the more-alternative-than-thou movie about the SF rave scene. Great music, though give me the original Human Traffic any day.",999907200,25,1453,4.613899613899614
1383410,1,B00004Z4WS,"Don't listen to the hype of the other reviews... this version of this film and the version that was shown in US theaters isn't half the film that the UK version is. Miramax cut so much of this film one would wonder what they were trying to do... but turn it into a romantic comedy!?! Plus, the PAL version of the DVD has a load of extras and music!!!
Lets just say this, one of the funniest moments in the film is the ""I remember what kind of club this used to be"" segment... and you won't find it in the US version. Plus, just about every drug reference has been changed.. including Moff's sequences. Brtish humor has been cut or overdubbed in the US version as well, so you won't see any East Enders jokes. Seriously, the amount of film that was cut for the US is too much to list here.
Don't believe the hype!!!! Buy yourself something that will play the PAL disc and buy it from Amazon.co.uk. You will be seeing the film the way it should be! The best rave movie I've seen.",996019200,7,977,4.202127659574468
1383411,5,B00004Z4WS,"Human Traffic is an absolutely amazing film, I would definitely put it up there in my all time hall of fame type places. One of the best things about it is that the main characters are all real people, they're not glitzy Hollywood stars but people that you could really meet on a night out. Of course, that's not to say that they're nothing special as they're all people I'd like to know! Another of the best things is that you can really relate to this film if you've ever indulged. Everyone plays their parts perfectly, and I laughed my head off when one of my friends exclaimed that they even chew their gum ""in that way"". One word of warning though, the American version of the film has been slightly censored. This didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the movie, but is was a shame to see that some choice scenes had been cut. As I say though, don't let that put you off! It's still a wicked movie and it will have you grinning from ear to ear. ""Reach for the lazers!""",994809600,5,979,4.297297297297297

Having been part of the rave and club scene, you can not fault the film at all. All the actors in the film must have 'been there and done it', you cant fault any of them. They give a strong performance.
I have seen the film twice in the cinema and many more times since buying it on DVD. I know the American club scene doenst have such an foothold on the youth of the US, but if anyone wants to see what the club scene of Britian is like, watch Human Traffic.

The acting was much better than in ""Groove"" (although that other dance-related film captures the excitment of the music better). A must for anyone interested in dance music, and a time-capsule of a certain slice of youth culture. The US edition seems to be 15-20 minutes shorter than the UK one, and some of the dialogue is overdubbed to replace Britishisms with Americanisms. Personally, I *hate* such tampering.

The biggest disappointment is that the DVD package that it is being released in is pretty poor indeed - no special features etc. It is a big shame because it's gonna put many people off buying it. Those distributors should get their acts together. It's only just hit the states, but has been available on DVD in the UK for over a year!

The director, Justin Kerrigan,  has the right formular for the making of a film which reflects not only clubland in th U.K. but the culture behind it too.  It's a true portrait of 20 something clubbers and the problems that all todays youth have to deal with in life. I saw this when it came out in London and was so taken by it that i went back 4 times to see it!

Now, i always wanted to see this movie when it first came out, but, I wasn't old enough to get in to see it, but, when my friend got it out on video, I watched it, and, then when I got a DVD player, it was one of the first DVD's I got, simply because, it is a great film. Admittadly, the Soundtrack holds the movie together, but, the soundtrack is so good it deserves its own movie anyway, so it all balances out, and in the end, you will be so happy that everything works out fine, that the fact there is a very thin plot line won't bother you, trust me, RENT IT FIRST, THEN BUY IT, because, once you rent it, you won't be able to get enough of Moff, Koop, Nina, Jip and Lulu, and even if you own the soundtrack, thats not enough, because there are parts of songs that aren't on the soundtrack, and, what the characters say before and during some of the tracks is just amazing, it makes you want to get up and dance.
