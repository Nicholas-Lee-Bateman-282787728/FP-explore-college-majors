8359015,5,B002A6ICKM,"I saw this way back when it was 1st aired publicly & it had an impact on the way I viewed art ever since. This item was a well used VHS tape (as advertised & expected), but it was still worth every cent. I think every lay person should have a chance to see this presentation, even if they're not ""into"" art. It can actually give you insight into how to view things from other perspectives just in your day-to-day lives.",1473033600,,419,4.185185185185185
8359016,5,B002A6ICKM,"The Scrolls, and Hockney's exposition of one of them, are a revelation.  The presentation of the teeming humanity -- the vast panoply of individuals living their lives -- and the exquisite depiction of their natural world, presented in the filmic dynamism of the scroll format, is stupendous.  These scrolls ought to be made into facsimiles and made available to all.  They are doubtless among the greatest of all works of art.  I'm indebted to Hockney for his illuminating lecture,  That this monumental work is not more widely circulated is a great injustice to those who hold art as sacred.",1445558400,,593,4.94949494949495
