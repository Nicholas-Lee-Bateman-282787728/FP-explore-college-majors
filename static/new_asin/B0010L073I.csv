Anyway, the movies (and Chris Tucker too) are very entertaining being full of action, comedy and an actual plot to follow. I really enjoyed Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2. Rush Hour 3 seemed to be a little redundant but was still worth watching and all three movies are worth owning, especially in this Trilogy collection.

Three good movies to have in any DVD collection which will have appeal again & again for many years.",1515888000,5,622,4.75

4/5 because I love the artwork and all the movies. And they look great on Blu Ray. Unfortunately, the product lost a star because Rush Hour 3 is region locked. I have never been blocked from playing Blu Rays on my PS4 ever, until Rush Hour 3.

If this had happened with 1 or 2 instead, I'd have given this a way lower rating but 3 is acceptable. I plan to just buy the movie separately and replace the discs. A shame, but acceptable. It's about time these American BluRays bit me on the ass.

3049408,5,B0010L073I,"Chances are you'll know whether or not you'll like this set before you even buy it.  But if you're a fan, this is definitely worth picking up, as it's the easiest and most affordable way to have all three films on Blu-Ray.  Coupled with a solid assortment of extras, including some brand new content, and a really interesting bit of packaging, and you couldn't ask for much more.

Personally, the only film of the trilogy I absolutely love is the original, while I think the second and third are merely decent.  I've never quite gotten the obsessive love for the second film many have...  it's probably the sloppiest and patchiest of the three, though admittedly still reasonably entertaining.  But even saying that, the original is such a good entry in the ""Buddy Cop"" genre, that I still enjoy watching the sequels from time to time just to spend more time with the characters...  even if they are wholly predictable and chock-full of non-stop cliches.  So I'm definitely enjoying this set.  You get one great movie and two solid (but mildly flawed) follow-ups for a great price.

Also, I could be wrong, but this set seems to be the only way (or at least the only practical way) to get the second film on Blu-Ray in Region 1 territories.  So if you're a completist who needs to have all three films on Blu-Ray, it's definitely worth picking this set up, even if you already own the others.

Just a side note, as it's proving to be a little controversial:  I'm not a massive fan of the cover-art, but it's got a lot of character, and I do think it's more interesting than the cover-art on previous releases for the films, so overall I can't complain too much.  At least they put some effort into it, even if it isn't quite my cup of tea.  Some of the reviewers here giving it poor reviews based on the cover art alone are being wholly unfair, since it in no way impacts the films or the content available on the discs.",1482624000,,1920,4.492795389048991

It's 5 discs, which includes a brand new 20 minute interview with Jackie and Brett Ratner.  Would have liked seeing Chris Tucker talk about the series, but something is better than nothing.

Inside the Blu-ray packaging is five discs with inserts that flip over to each one.  The cover art of the discs and the box are nice, and I'll post photos so everyone knows what to expect.

The quality of the films is pretty good for a Blu-ray conversion.  It's just finally nice to have all three films in a nice collection.

I have my copy already pre-ordered and can't wait for it to ship.

Oh, and Gregory: the review system is intended to help potential customers decide if the product in question is something that would interest them, based on the experiences of other customers.

3049460,4,B0010L073I,"I'm docking this three-pack one star because of the jewel case; instead of opening the jewel case to find three plastic pages, as I expected, or even slots molded onto the inside covers for one disc to sit, in partial view, one above the other, I found all three discs stacked, one directly on top of the other, in what appears to be a slot originally intended for only one disc.  Upon closer examination and comparison, I discovered that the button labeled ""Push,"" in the center of where the three discs rest, is taller than similar buttons in single-disc cases, but I would still prefer a case with three separate slots for each disc, so that I'd never be obliged to take one or two discs out to get to the one I want.

Each disc comes with a commentary track by the Director, Brett Ratner;  these commentary tracks on Rush Hour 2 and 3 each include dialogue with the Writer, Jeff Nathanson, as well as the Director.  Most of the other Special Features seem designed to promote the Director, although there are bios and filmographies for other members of the crew and cast.  These special features include other films, including a student film.  If you can't afford to release your films when you're a student and/or too poor, why not release them when you're a big shot, directing stars such as Jackie Chan, right?

Rush Hour has subtitles available, but only in English; Rush Hour 2 has subtitles available in English, Spanish, and French; Rush Hour 3 only has subtitles available in English and Spanish, which is odd, since a significant portion of the scenes take place in Paris.",1469059200,9,1585,4.639285714285714

Plus I hadn't seen the third, so I figured I'd pick up this three disc pack. I already had the first one in my collection, but it was the full-frame version.

For some reason the subtitles on the second movie didn't work for me and I couldn't find where to turn them on. First and third movies the subtitles worked fine. I was a little concerned when I started the third movie as it started up as full-frame, apparently that disc has both versions on it. Going to the menu and selecting the widescreen presentation corrected that.

These movies come with various special features and some with commentaries. If you're wanting some light entertainment, you probably wouldn't be disappointed with this trio of movies.",1467590400,,841,4.793103448275862

These films are a MUST SEE for Chan fans and really anyone who likes to laugh. Chan's unique blend of action and comedy is what separates him from all other action stars.

3049587,4,B0010L073I,"I was shopping for movies on the bargain rack of a nearby Ross Store and found the ""Rush Hour 3 Pack."" I was reluctant to buy it at first because I'd never heard of the movies and I'd never watched a marshal arts film. Oh well, it would be something new. I really enjoyed the original ""Rush Hour."" It was a lot of fast action in Los Angeles and was rather funny in a strange and different way. I was chuckling off and on throughout the whole movie and I wondered how they ever managed to make such movies. The story didn't amount to much, I might add, but it was an enjoyable movie. I could say the same thing for ""Rush Hour 2,"" except the location was Hong Kong. Again, the story was ho-hum but it was a fun movie to watch. Not as fun as the original Rush Hour, I might add. ""Rush Hour 3"" took place in Paris and most of it was centered around the Eiffel Tower. I just didn't particularly care for it. By that time, I was burned out on the Rush Hour way of doing things. It became tiresome and I  was just eager for it to end. As a three pack, it's a good deal, if you like this type of movie. I'm going to rate it four stars, but be aware that I think Rush Hour 3 was only 2 stars. The three movies of very much the same thing just became a bit tiresome. I rated each of the individual movies separately under their own titles, if you're interested. I gave 4 stars to the first two.

4/5 because I love the artwork and all the movies. And they look great on Blu Ray. Unfortunately, the product lost a star because Rush Hour 3 is region locked. I have never been blocked from playing Blu Rays on my PS4 ever, until Rush Hour 3.

If this had happened with 1 or 2 instead, I'd have given this a way lower rating but 3 is acceptable. I plan to just buy the movie separately and replace the discs. A shame, but acceptable. It's about time these American BluRays bit me on the ass.

3283905,5,B0010L073I,"Chances are you'll know whether or not you'll like this set before you even buy it.  But if you're a fan, this is definitely worth picking up, as it's the easiest and most affordable way to have all three films on Blu-Ray.  Coupled with a solid assortment of extras, including some brand new content, and a really interesting bit of packaging, and you couldn't ask for much more.

Personally, the only film of the trilogy I absolutely love is the original, while I think the second and third are merely decent.  I've never quite gotten the obsessive love for the second film many have...  it's probably the sloppiest and patchiest of the three, though admittedly still reasonably entertaining.  But even saying that, the original is such a good entry in the ""Buddy Cop"" genre, that I still enjoy watching the sequels from time to time just to spend more time with the characters...  even if they are wholly predictable and chock-full of non-stop cliches.  So I'm definitely enjoying this set.  You get one great movie and two solid (but mildly flawed) follow-ups for a great price.

Also, I could be wrong, but this set seems to be the only way (or at least the only practical way) to get the second film on Blu-Ray in Region 1 territories.  So if you're a completist who needs to have all three films on Blu-Ray, it's definitely worth picking this set up, even if you already own the others.

Just a side note, as it's proving to be a little controversial:  I'm not a massive fan of the cover-art, but it's got a lot of character, and I do think it's more interesting than the cover-art on previous releases for the films, so overall I can't complain too much.  At least they put some effort into it, even if it isn't quite my cup of tea.  Some of the reviewers here giving it poor reviews based on the cover art alone are being wholly unfair, since it in no way impacts the films or the content available on the discs.",1482624000,,1920,4.492795389048991

3283957,4,B0010L073I,"I'm docking this three-pack one star because of the jewel case; instead of opening the jewel case to find three plastic pages, as I expected, or even slots molded onto the inside covers for one disc to sit, in partial view, one above the other, I found all three discs stacked, one directly on top of the other, in what appears to be a slot originally intended for only one disc.  Upon closer examination and comparison, I discovered that the button labeled ""Push,"" in the center of where the three discs rest, is taller than similar buttons in single-disc cases, but I would still prefer a case with three separate slots for each disc, so that I'd never be obliged to take one or two discs out to get to the one I want.

Each disc comes with a commentary track by the Director, Brett Ratner;  these commentary tracks on Rush Hour 2 and 3 each include dialogue with the Writer, Jeff Nathanson, as well as the Director.  Most of the other Special Features seem designed to promote the Director, although there are bios and filmographies for other members of the crew and cast.  These special features include other films, including a student film.  If you can't afford to release your films when you're a student and/or too poor, why not release them when you're a big shot, directing stars such as Jackie Chan, right?

Rush Hour has subtitles available, but only in English; Rush Hour 2 has subtitles available in English, Spanish, and French; Rush Hour 3 only has subtitles available in English and Spanish, which is odd, since a significant portion of the scenes take place in Paris.",1469059200,9,1585,4.639285714285714

Plus I hadn't seen the third, so I figured I'd pick up this three disc pack. I already had the first one in my collection, but it was the full-frame version.

For some reason the subtitles on the second movie didn't work for me and I couldn't find where to turn them on. First and third movies the subtitles worked fine. I was a little concerned when I started the third movie as it started up as full-frame, apparently that disc has both versions on it. Going to the menu and selecting the widescreen presentation corrected that.

These movies come with various special features and some with commentaries. If you're wanting some light entertainment, you probably wouldn't be disappointed with this trio of movies.",1467590400,,841,4.793103448275862

The duo of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, provide the perfect men pairing up within this franchise.  The movie series is incredibly hilarious; yet it also provides a strong base point with very solid, intellectually touching and morally strong undertones.  I am continually refreshed in residing to know that I did not purchase just one film from the franchise.  I decided to go all out and buy all three films because, fortunately as they progress within the series; each new film gets better than the last.",1378080000,,594,4.91

The case, the cover was slashed, the inside circles holding the dvds were smashed and mailed along with the DVDs, rubbing up against them all the way; even the file folder-type holder for the next disc had broken hinges. All of this and wrapped in plastic flawlessly - with torn open ""security stickers"" UNDERNEATH that. I don't know if this is Bootleg or what, but if I want to watch the movies themselves, they seem to be fine; I just have to be VERY careful with the container as it is impossible to not scrape and scratch the discs (thankfully I still see no damage on the discs themselves but for that odd discolored film on the underside).

I received the order on time, and got what was expected.
I got the first Rush Hour on one disc, and then 2 and 3 on the other disc. It's one of those double-sided discs, so you just need to take some extra care getting fingerprints and whatnot on the disc, but both worked just fine!

In terms of the content.. It's Rush Hour. That's all you need to know. Surely you're a fan of the series if you're considering picking this up. And if not.. Buy it anyway. :) If you're a fan of the buddy-cop/culture clash genre of movie, then consider picking this up. I haven't seen a collection for Blu-Ray as of now, so this (for now) is the best you'll get.",1339027200,,721,4.179856115107913
3284084,4,B0010L073I,"I was shopping for movies on the bargain rack of a nearby Ross Store and found the ""Rush Hour 3 Pack."" I was reluctant to buy it at first because I'd never heard of the movies and I'd never watched a marshal arts film. Oh well, it would be something new. I really enjoyed the original ""Rush Hour."" It was a lot of fast action in Los Angeles and was rather funny in a strange and different way. I was chuckling off and on throughout the whole movie and I wondered how they ever managed to make such movies. The story didn't amount to much, I might add, but it was an enjoyable movie. I could say the same thing for ""Rush Hour 2,"" except the location was Hong Kong. Again, the story was ho-hum but it was a fun movie to watch. Not as fun as the original Rush Hour, I might add. ""Rush Hour 3"" took place in Paris and most of it was centered around the Eiffel Tower. I just didn't particularly care for it. By that time, I was burned out on the Rush Hour way of doing things. It became tiresome and I  was just eager for it to end. As a three pack, it's a good deal, if you like this type of movie. I'm going to rate it four stars, but be aware that I think Rush Hour 3 was only 2 stars. The three movies of very much the same thing just became a bit tiresome. I rated each of the individual movies separately under their own titles, if you're interested. I gave 4 stars to the first two.

Please note the Rush Hour collections arrived on time but I took a lot of time to open and play them.  Please note only one DVD was OK, Rush Hour 2 and 3 were not even playing.  So overall the DVDs were not working / not good. It's just a waste of money If possible please mail me good working copies.

thanks
