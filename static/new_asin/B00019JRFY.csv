""What a piece of work is man!
How noble in reason!
How infinite in faculties!
In form and moving, how express and admirable!
In action, how like an angel!
In apprehension, how like a god!
The beauty of the world!
The paragon of animals!""

The man this program is in search for is the one who wrote the above beautiful words and, as well, wrote many verses and words like it.  His name: William Shakespeare (1564 to 1616), ""[a man] not of an age, but for all time.""

Surprisingly, not much is known of Shakespeare's life, until now.  The enthusiastic Michael Wood takes us on a wonderful trek to discover just who Shakespeare was.  We learn about such things as follows:

his parentage; his birth; his times, the politics and religion of the time; his youth; his marriage and loves; his ""lost"" years; his London years; his career; and his plays and sonnets.

There are four parts to this program (originally aired on the Public Broadcasting Station).  Each includes a very brief introduction that I will reproduce here:

(1) A Time of Reformation (9 scenes including introduction and credits)

""Like all stories in history, this is a search for ghosts.  A quest for the people that made us what we are.  And for one man in particular.  William Shakespeare is the most famous writer of all times...Yet his life is still shrouded in mystery...This is a historical detective story...searching for the life of William Shakespeare of Stratford Upon the Avon.""

This is the only part where Wood gives a summary.  He says,

""There's the first nineteen years of Shakespeare's life.  [Wood then proceeds with his brief summary...]  and that's just the beginning of the story!""

(2) The Lost Years (8 scenes)

""How did a poor country boy...become such a celebrity so soon after he arrived in London?  It's one of the great mysteries of Shakespeare's life...Ten years before Shakespeare had been...in Stratford with no job and few prospects.  How did he do it?  How did he make that leap?  And what did he do in those ten years?""

(3) The Duty of Poets (8 scenes)

""In the 1590s the English theatre entered its golden age and for the next twenty years its brightest star was William Shakespeare.  But back in the early 1590s, Shakespeare was one of many gifted young poets.  What was it that transformed him in the next few years to the greatest thing anybody had ever seen.  What happened to him in his career and his private life?""

(4) For All Time (8 scenes)

""For William Shakespeare, 1603 was a very good year.  Writer, actor, director, he was now the artist and chief of Elizabethan theatre.  He created some of the greatest characters in literature...In [England], theatre wasn't just entertainment, it was popular and political - it had a thrilling and dangerous power.  Shakespeare...is...in his late thirties...Out of the experience of his life and the turbulent times through which he lived, the new worlds and the lost worlds, he pulls it all together in some of the greatest works of literature ever written.  It's that last story and the mysterious end to his career that we're going to uncover.""

Wood travels extensively to different places, talking and interviewing people.  He even reads from the actual historical documents that indicate something about Shakespeare, some of it uncovered only recently!

The cinematography is breathtaking.  The photography inside actual buildings of Shakespeare's time is fantastic.  The background music compliments Wood's narrative.

Special mention should be given to the Royal Shakespearean Company who travel with Wood.  They act out bits of not only Shakespeare's plays but other plays of that time (such as those of his rival, Christopher Marlowe).  You'll hear bits of his plays from each of these categories:

the Romantic Comedies (example: ""A Midsummers Night Dream""); the Histories (example: ""Henry IV,"" Part 1); Tragedies (example: ""Macbeth""); and the Tragicomic Romances (example: ""The Tempest"").  (There was no example from his ""Problem"" plays.)

There is one DVD extra (about twenty minutes) that has eight scenes. It is quite good.

The DVD's picture and sound quality were perfect.  There were no distracting artifacts.

Finally, if you're a William Shakespeare fanatic like I am, then you'll enjoy this program.  I learned a lot of new things that I was not aware of before.  If you're a newcomer to Shakespeare's life then I envy you.  This program is the best introduction to his life, in my opinion, that there is.

In conclusion, be sure to view this program and find out why Shakespeare discovered that the duty of poets was ""to speak what we feel and not what we ought to say!""

1982834,5,B00019JRFY,"I love Michael Wood. In his wonderful legacy series and in his books also, he puts a friendly arm around the viewer/reader and takes him/her on a voyage to old places which he makes new by his up-close show-and-tell-style. By jove, I never knew so many of Shakespeare's haunts were still standing, nor had I ever been so immersed in the traditions that are still going strong from Shakespeare's times. M. W. takes us inside dozens of town halls, old manors and castles to the very spots where the Bard first performed as a boy, applied for a wedding license, played for the queen, etc. By placing Shakespeare squarely in his dangerous times and showing us the political and religious plots that swirled around him, Shakespeare became beautifully real for me. M.W. shows us Shakespeare's writing may be for all times but the Bard was very much a product of his times. Beautifully photographed, also, and oh yes, Anglophiles will love all the neat old places. Thanks Michael.",1095984000,47,973,4.7976190476190474
1982835,4,B00019JRFY,"It is more than quarter of a century since Michael, nearly fresh out of Oriel College Oxford, first appeared on our TV screens. Clad in unfusty denim, he hurled himself about the great English outdoors, enthusiastically telling us about Eric Bloodaxe and Co in the BBC series 'In Search of the Dark Ages'.
Since then, Michael has been abroad with 'In Search of the Trojan War', 'In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great', and ... well, you get the general picture.
Now he's back in England -- mostly Warwickshire, Lancashire and London, actually -- and he's ditched the denim in favour of the Barbour 'Bushman' jacket and Karrimor backpack. This four-part programme is as much a celebration of England's landscape and ancient buildings as it is the story of our greatest playwright. The photography is exceptional, the music well-composed, and Michael is always a pleasant companion to escort us around the key sites. We also spend much time in the company of the RSC, as they travel around the more authentic venues to perform excerpts from Othello, Henry IVth Part Two, Romeo & Juliet etc.
There's always latent demand on British TV for Shakespeare insmall, digestible chunks. It is one of the regrets of so many adults that they wished they liked Shakespeare more ... if only it wasn't so much work to appreciate him, compared to 'Friends' etc. Here Michael makes him very digestible. If you could cope with 'Shakespeare in Love', then you can handle this series. The problem for me is that, having now viewed it once, when will I next want to watch it again? Probably in a couple of years' time. This is really a DVD to buy, watch once, and then lend to friends and family.
One intriguing moment: in the College of Arms sequence, William Hunt, who used to run the HAC recruits course, takes Michael through the creation of the Shakespeare coat of arms. For the final shot, Mr Hunt is suddenly wearing his mess kit -- why??
But back to the real world: one of the strengths of this series is that it shows the audience so clearly entranced and enjoying themselves.  If this series doesn't have you rushing out to buy a copy of Ovid's Metamorphoses, it should at least persuade you to stop watching the telly and go out to the theatre, which can be no bad thing.",1081555200,62,2262,4.669172932330827
1982836,5,B00019JRFY,This is a really well thoughtful and well-done documentary.  It contains a lot of information that I have never seen or heard of anywhere else.,1474934400,,143,4.72

1982840,5,B00019JRFY,"While this 4 part series from Brit Michael Wood is meticulously researched and ideally presented, it must remain inconclusive. Try as he might, Wood can only conjecture on many of the points that he discovers while searching for the most celebrated and most elusive of English writers. The important thing here is not to take everything Wood says as gospel. He doesn't. Once you do that, there is much to like and even enjoy as Wood takes us on an Elizabethan Mystery Tour. What he uncovers from what remains from Shakespeare's time is more a portrait of Elizabeth's England than it is of Shakespeare himself.

The series is divided into 4 one hour programs...1) A Time of Revolution, 2) The Lost Years, 3) The Duty of Poets, 4) For All Time. Number One sets the stage admirably with its focus on Catholic -vs- Protestant (Shakespeare's family and friends were Catholic) giving us loads of background on the politics of early Elizabethan England. Number Three focuses on what sets Shakespeare's poems and plays apart from his contemporaries. Number Four focuses on Shakespeare's final years and on his lasting legacy as a writer. The title FOR ALL TIME is taken from a quote by Shakespeare's great contemporary, Ben Jonson.

I have saved Part Two for last for the title THE LOST YEARS says it all. It covers from 1583 when Shakespeare was 19 and newly married to Anne Hathaway who was 7 years older (their first child was on the way) to 1593 when Shakespeare emerges as the number one playwright after the murder of Christopher Marlowe. It is in this episode where, despite his diligent and painstaking efforts, Wood can only surmise what must have happened during that time. Where did Shakespeare live? What did he do? Who was his mistress? All enticing questions that, for now, cannot be answered. There's too much ""Could this have been?"" and ""I think so.""

Nevertheless IN SEARCH OF SHAKESPEARE is a remarkable and entertaining program that gives us a solid picture of what it was like to live in Elizabethan England. I was surprised and fascinated by the archives which contained a wealth of everyday detail concerning people under the watch of Elizabeth's spies. It was like a 16th century version of the present day electronic surveillance exposed by Edward Snowden. The visual splendor of the English countryside is breathtaking (this documentary is part travelogue) and the number of places associated with Shakespeare that still exist is remarkable. Overall a 5 star effort but not the final word on the subject.

P.S.
Scenes from Shakespeare's plays are enacted throughout by the Royal Shakespeare Company and in TWELFTH NIGHT you can see a young Eddie Redmayne at the start of his career. Other notables include Anthony Sher looking quite like Mark Strong and old pro Julian Glover (INDIANA JONES & THE LAST CRUSADE) as King Lear.",1456790400,6,2841,4.9002079002079
1982841,1,B00019JRFY,"Michael Woods was great in the Story of India, but he is off his rocker, here. He accepted what he was told at face value, without doing any investigation of his own. Because anyone who does any sort of investigation at all quickly realizes that you have to be a total idiot to accept the story that the guy from Stratford was the actual author.

1982843,5,B00019JRFY,The perfect companion for any Shakespeare fanatic. This documentary tells a more in depth story about the real man behind the myth. For those who have a true appreciation for the Bard it allows you to see what inspired and shaped Shakespeare's genious. And for those who are ignorant of the profound significance of Shakespeare and his works it will enlighten and astonish.,1440547200,,373,4.936507936507937
1982844,5,B00019JRFY,"In my mind, this is not only a great introduction to Shakespeare, but possibly the best introduction possible. This was written by and features the narration of the noted historian Michael Woods. There are two companion books that Woods wrote in conjunction with this project that have excellent sources. I recommend that you watch this first, and then if you are more interested, purchase either of those two books. The reason why this excels when others fail is because it gives you a little bit of everything:  the political and religious controversies of Shakespeare's day, how he rose to fame, why his work continues to attract, and recent performance clips by the Royal Shakespeare Company, many of which are set in places that Shakespeare himself worked. Furthermore, Woods takes you to see many primary sources that have never been captured on video and you would never have access to unless you were perhaps a doctoral candidate at Oxford or Cambridge. In addition, this video is balanced and avoids the extremes that have been seen in regard to Shakespeare's biography. Woods tells you what we know and what we could guess. The plausible, possible, and impossible are clearly delineated. Quite simply, if you really want to have a good background knowledge of Shakespeare and his times, you should start with this video. My highest recommendation.",1437523200,,1357,5.058035714285714
1982845,5,B00019JRFY,"Michael Wood's skill in bringing Shakespeare to life is brilliant.  Even someone not familiar with his plays will enjoy the sheer genius of a man who was not only the greatest playwright of all time, but also an actor, director, theater manager, and son, husband and father.",1430265600,,274,4.829787234042553
1982846,4,B00019JRFY,"I had originally seen this on PBS years ago.  I lent the video cassette to a friend who lent it to a friend and I never got it back!  So when I found it on Amazon I decided to order it.  Enjoyed it for the second time too.  A few years ago I ordered the (Amazon)  book ""Will in the World"" and this is another and similar view of the times he lived in. Considering both this PBS DVD and the book, I would recommend ""Will in the World"" as being better.",1430092800,,450,3.847826086956522
1982847,2,B00019JRFY,"I watched this when if first came out on PBS when I knew nothing about the Shakespeare authorship question.  Even then, it seemed grossly slanted toward Wood's politically correct, multicultural biases (Catholic good- Puritan bad etc.), while the hammy play performances and their pumped up ""studio audiences"" embarrassed and bored me.  Now that I know how little evidence there is for all the sentimentally-hyped assertions Wood smirkily makes (the sonnets written to William's son?-- I ask you-- was he a child-abuser?), I find it a highly amusing exercise in obfuscation-- one evasion or lie right on through shyster Bill's  twisty existence.  John Aubrey and Nicholas Rowe would have been proud.  First watching-- an irritating puzzle.  Second watching-- a good laugh.  Wood does know how to economize on his footage.

Michael Wood is a very scholarly as well as delightful host on this expedition back into Shakespeare's times, and intrepid in his estimate of the things that were closest to Shakespeare's heart.

1982862,1,B00019JRFY,"I like Michael Wood, a lot. His charisma, energy, and intelligence are difficult to beat. Yet, In Search of Shakespeare is a horrifically bungled attempt to bring Shakespeare to life. It's not hyperbole to suggest that more than 90% of the claims are pure speculation. Wood's notes, several times, that Ovid's Metamorphoses was WS's favorite book as a child. Really? The proof? He does this incessantly throughout the series, always passing these things off as undoubtedly true when there isn't a single shred of evidence supporting anything. The truth of the matter is that very, VERY little is known or historically documented about the man. Please, if you watch this simply question the assertions and ask ""where's the evidence?""

1982865,5,B00019JRFY,"When I first heard about this program, I initially wasn't very excited, and feared it might be boring. I'm happy to say that I was most certainly wrong. This show is extraordinary. It does things with biographical narrative that few other documentaries achieve. There is a level of minute detail that is unmatched and extraordinary, and it moves at a pace slow enough that I can fully digest the richness of Shakespeare. The show's narration is extraordinary, and while it does challenge the viewer at times, it is always exciting to re-watch and re-listen.

I must admit, I have not finished the series. I am currently watching episode two and taking in the subtle nuances of the narrator's various passions for Shakespeare. He definitely seems like he would have wanted to be Shakespeare's friend back if he were were alive in that time. His extraordinary passion for Shakespeare is unmatched, and it was and is honestly inspiring to watch.

The inter-cut performances of Shakespeare are extraordinary, and they really liven up the slower-paced (though interesting) sections. This show really seems to go for a ""slow-burn"" aproach of delivering its information, which due to the high amount of ""seemingly mundane"" details, is a blessing. No stone goes un-turned in this show, no matter how irrelevant or minute it may seem.

Overall I find this documentary to be inconceivably extraordinary, and I would recommend it to anyone...including Shakespeare himself.

He has the ability to provide deep insights into the topic he pursues rather than just the old grade-school date recitation approach to history.  That deep analysis gives us a sense of being investigative reporters seeking the truth in the historical events.  This is history that finds the human element that shapes history.  This approach is especially well suited to biography.  Through the places and religious/political tensions of his time, Wood helps us better understand Shakespeare and his genius.

1982871,5,B00019JRFY,"Shakespeare is one of those enigmatic figures from history.  I've often found his writing difficult to understand. This video biography provides a context for understanding the times in which he lived and the true talent that he was.  So many of his plays were topical to issues of his times (and still to ours).  While coming from a Catholic family background, he managed to thrive at court in Elizabeth's Anglican England.

Having previously seen this series on PBS, we bought this video just after returning from a trip to England and a visit to Stratford upon Avon, including his childhood home and the Royal Shakespeare Company Theater.  On a previous trip we visited the new Globe Theater in London.  All are worth seeing, and this video is suggested watching before you go.

Also worth acquiring is Michael Shama's ""A History of Great Britain"" a 15 hour, 5 DVD set.  It was developed for the BBC and the History Channel some 10 years ago.  Multiple viewings are required to truly capture the long complex 5,000 year history of Great Britain.",1309910400,2,1048,4.810055865921788
1982872,5,B00019JRFY,"Michael Wood is good at everything he touches. His documentaries are clear and fun to follow. What makes this one excel is not just the direct information on the life and times of Shakespeare but the biographies of his contemporaries.

I have seen just about all of the plays and read some of the sonnets but this documentary seems to bring its own life to the parts of the plays that are portrait and makes you want to be there now.

I also enjoyed seeing what is left of the places that Shakespeare lived. However, it was even more impressive to see the recreation of the Globe Theater.

When Michael was walking around in the estuary, it was fun watching him in his Wellies it made you think of ""Midsummer murders.""

I also thought I knew pretty much about the time of Shakespeare. However, I received a good civil lesson and a different perspective of the plays as they were written for the politics of the time. Today in our quasi-police state, we again can see how powerful moving force plays can be. One day they may meat with censorship here.

Anyway leaving off all the deep thoughts this documentary make, you realize why they made T.V.

The documentary comes in four parts so it is a good idea to put some time between each viewing so you have time to think and talk about what you saw.

The Lost Years

1982873,5,B00019JRFY,"I was an English major in college and remain a Shakespeare fanatic, so I have studied Shakespeare quite a bit. Still, this documentary is loaded with historical information about both Shakespeare himself and the times he lived in that I never came across in my studies.  Despite the depth of the information, it is all told in an accessible, engaging style that anyone from high school students to English professors could appreciate.

Given Michael Woods' performance in this documentary, as well as two of the Conquistador documentaries I have seen, I would actually say he is a better documentarian than Ken Burns.  Not to take anything away from Ken Burns, but the depth Woods can go into on a subject without losing the average viewer is amazing.",1279238400,4,751,4.897637795275591
1982874,5,B00019JRFY,"I have owned this DVD for a few years now and I have watched it several times. I do not see how it could be improved upon. My wife was an English teacher who turned me on to Shakespeare years ago and I was always frustrated at the lack of a reliable source of information on Shakespeare and the world he inhabited. This DVD satisfied my curiosity as it explores the life of his father, his home life, his marriage to Anne Hathaway, the police state that was the Elizabethan age, his friends and competitors like Christopher Marlowe, and the Catholic vs. Protestant split that defined the times. Outstanding.",1256860800,6,607,4.577981651376147

1982878,5,B00019JRFY,"Simply put, one of the best documentaries I've seen.  I was one of those kids who suffered through Shakespeare in high school, but that began to change one warm, tranquil summer night when the local university staged outdoors a production of A Midsummers' Night Dream; so moving and atmospheric, it was the way Shakespeare should be appreciated--not cooped in some classroom reading it from a book.  And so too this documentary captures the essence of Shapespeare the man and the Elizabethan England in which he lived (as a subversive, no less).  Shakespeare was NOT the man that centuries of scholars and changing moral tastes have made him into; he was a dynamic man, one who lived at times on the fringes of society, a man in many respects at odds with his changing times.  He was, therefore, a person that youth of any generation in truth should be able to identify with, and this ultimately is what this fine documentary reveals.  One can only wonder what a difference this documentary would have made had I been able to see it when I was in high school.",1212105600,8,1059,4.672043010752688
1982879,5,B00019JRFY,"IN Search of Shakespeare is a 4-part documentary shown on PBS recently. I missed the first part, but watched with increasing interest the last three. Rarely have I found a documentary so engaging and ultimately moving. I should also mention that it is beautifully photographed.

It was written and presented enthusiastically by host/narrator Michael Wood. Wood travels to the original scenes, sometimes the original buildings associated with various stages of Shakespeare's life. He goes into the archives and lets us see with our own eyes original documents like wills, legal documents, contemporary books, theater schedules, etc., that pertain directly to Shakespeare. He follows the modern Royal Shakespeare Company on tour, and we see scenes from Shakespeare's plays and other plays contemporary with Shakespeare. Most importantly, we learn about the events of history, politics, and Shakespeare's personal life that intersect with the plays and sonnets he wrote.

Can you really ""know"" Shakespeare by watching a four hour documentary? Hardly. I think his true beliefs are enigmatic, and whatever he expressed in his plays was necessarily limited by the censorship and political expediencies of his time. But his was a great art, and this biographical documentary gives us at least a hint of what lay behind that great art. Context is always helpful.

Even Shakespeare's greatest rival -- in a folio of Shakespeare's plays published after his death as a tribute that would allow future generations to remember and appreciate hitherto unpublished works -- wrote of William S., ""He was a man not for our time, but for all time.""",1205625600,5,1630,5.310077519379845

1982881,5,B00019JRFY,"Shakespeare was born in 1564, attended the Stratford grammar School , marries Anne Hathaway in 1582, his wife had their last children in 1585, a legal action is taken up against him in 1589 and then he is in London working as a playr and playwright. How did this country peasant come to write such magnificent works of art. Michael Wood seeks to answer age old questions about his identity and lost years. This DVD  is an in-depth exploration with some pretty bold statements as to what kind of person Shakespeare was and how he grew and developed.  He manages quite successfully to make a very strong case that in the end seem like the right answers. He fully supports his postulations with very convincing evidence, some of which is fairly recent. Many points that were previously contested are simply explained away. Is he correct? Who knows? What matters here is that these suppositions are supported strongly with evidence both hard and factual or linked by casual but strong inference.  It is a creditable piece that offers clear counterpoint to all the conspiracy"" Shakespeare was written by someone else"" theories. Case in fact, we know more about Shakespeare than any other playwright except for Ben Jonson, those few facts coupled with Wood's explanations and  evidence clearly supports the idea that Shakespeare wrote his own plays.",1192060800,6,1343,4.955555555555556
1982882,5,B00019JRFY,"Another wonderful work by Michael Wood.  This time, he sticks close to home, wandering across England.  Whether crossing a river estuary at night, watching the Royal Shakespeare Company rehearse, or sitting in front of the fireplace in the Shakespeare family home, Wood tells the story with all the enthusiasm his fans expect.

For the first time, Will Shakespeare actually comes alive.  It's fascinating to see how much he was a man of his times.  I was completely unaware of the ""backstories"" of his plays.  For instance, Macbeth premiered shortly after the collapse of the Gunpowder Plot.  As Wood points out, he presented a play about the murder of a Scottish monarch, shortly after an attempt to murder a Scottish monarch, in the court of this monarch.

Shakespeare comes across here on all levels. The country boy, the family man, the writer, the parent, the political man, and the religious man.  Sonnets about the love for a boy turn out to be written just after the death of William's young son.  Wood makes sure we see how much of himself Shakespeare put into his works, and how he used his work as a means of expressing his real feelings and emotions.

As I said, he was a man of his times, and they were fascinating times.  Religious conflict, war, corruption, and other human acts all play a role in the plays and poems he wrote.  Intriguingly, Wood shows us that racial strife was also part of this age, and that Will showed his sympathies with the classic ""Othello"".

The cinematography is excellent.  It's fascinating to watch Wood wander through the streets of London with a hand-drawn map in his hands, discussing the location and significance of a long-vanished building.

It's also a glimpse into what I'll call The Idea of England, as we walk through breathtaking gardens, cozy cottages, bustling streets, and so on.  We watch old fashioned printings of the Works of Shakespeare, laugh at plays by students at the Stratford school Shakespeare attended, and talk glove-making (the trade of Will's father John) with a Master.

I've long admired Shakespeare's works.  I wish I could say that I love them, but they are hard to read on one's own.  I shudder at what would have happened had Wood taken us down that road, but he doesn't.  Instead, he presents snippets of plays- both those of the Bard, and those of his contemporaries- with The Royal Shakespeare Company.  Watching these talented performers, one begins to get a real feel for the emotions the plays contain.  Seeing a contemporary audience as the Company presents a bit of Shakespeare, you begin to understand why he's still so popular.  It's also fascinating to listen to these performers talk about certain aspects of the works.

I highly recommend this.  I wish it were another 2 hours long, but then Wood has never led me astray yet.  I suspect I'll watch this as much as some of Wood's other works.",1180915200,6,2884,4.7854251012145745
1982883,4,B00019JRFY,"Here's an easy-going visual tour of Shakespeare's life. At four episodes, it has more detail than is customarily seen in a TV documentary. A great deal of it is speculation -- some of which hangs on the slimmest bit of evidence  -- but Wood generally admits when that is so.

One bit of speculation that Woods doesn't seem to tolerate, however, is the authorship of the plays. That is only touched on in a minute or so.

As seen in his other documentaries too, Wood is a left-learning, politically-charged historian, and he focuses on what he calls the ""Elizabethan police state"" in the service of the Protestant Reformation which he asserts (fairly convincingly) had a major influence on Catholic-oriented Shakespeare. And he often makes cynical comparisons to the modern events. If you adjust for his bias, you'll find this a good history lesson of Elizabethan times.

There is some examination of the theaters, actors, playwrights, and practices which I found fascinating (I would have liked more). And, he doesn't forget the poetry -- he drags the Royal Shakespeare Company around the country with him to provide juicy fragments of the plays at different venues.

For those interested in Shakespeare, this is an easy DVD to recommend.",1180310400,7,1238,4.990291262135922
1982884,5,B00019JRFY,"This four-part documentary goes above and beyond in bringing us the true story of the life and times of William Shakespeare, the greatest writer who ever lived.  Each segment runs about an hour, but those four hours flew by in the blink of an eye for me because the story was so riveting.  The viewer gets to know Shakespeare as a person, not just as some writer who lived in a very distant land and time and wrote in a rather hard to understand language.  Not a lot has previously been known about his personal life, but thanks to this wonderful series, there are now a lot more facts out there.  It also really helps that Michael Wood, the narrator, is really enthusiastic about his subject, and has a very friendly and engaging demeanour, instead of being some boring overly academic suit.

Shakespeare did not exist in a vacuum; his life, and by extension his writing, were shaped by the outside forces around him.  The man lived through a lot of turbulent times, witnessing such events as the Armada, the Gunpowder Plot, and the beginnings of colonisation in the Americas.  Elizabethan England was also a major police state, and his family were often at the brunt of it, seeing as how they were originally Catholics.  In the era before separation of church and state, to be the ""wrong"" religion was inviting a lot of persecution.  He had also experienced firsthand a lot of highs and lows in his life; for a time his father held a lot of positions of prestige, honor, and respect, enabling him to go to a good private school, but at the age of fourteen, the family fortunes disappeared as quickly as they had sprung up, and he was forced to leave school, his literary awakening, and the promise of going to college and making something of his life.  It's really an amazing story how this young man was able to go from a nobody farmer's son to a highly renowned and respected playwright starting in the 1590s, to say nothing of going down in history as the greatest writer ever.  Though the series explores a lot of aspects of his life and times (such as the Globe Theatre, the earliest plays he acted in, the tragic death of his son Hamnet, his marriage, his Catholic roots, where he lived, his friends, and of course his wonderful plays), I was still left wanting more.  Shakespeare was such a fascinating person, who lived in such fascinating times, that just 4 hours is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to delving into his life and what he was all about!  Interspersed with this journey into who Shakespeare really was are scenes from the current players in England's Royal Shakespeare Company acting out some of his plays, such as 'Macbeth,' 'Hamlet,' 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' 'Romeo and Juliet,' and 'The Tempest.'  In the end, the series shows how, though he wrote very much for his own time, in the end he was a man for all times.  A lot of the things he wrote about and dealt with seem so very modern, as though they could have been written in much more modern times but for the often hard-to-understand Elizabethan English.  Too many people make the mistake of seeing him as a balding middle-aged guy in an Elizabethan collar, not as someone who was once young and just starting out in his life and career, and as someone who's inaccessible to the modern era just because, to be honest, it can be rather hard to read and appreciate his works without seeing them on the stage or screen or at least studying them with a teacher.  There are also some deleted scenes which go into further detail on some of the subjects explored, such as Shakespeare's rival playwright Christopher Marlowe and his family's Catholic roots.

As awesome as this series was, however, I was a bit shocked to see numerous scenes of Mr. Wood and some of his assistants actually handling these original books, documents, and other artifacts with their bare hands.  There were maybe 5 scenes in which they actually wore gloves before touching these pages which are over 400 years old.  I was also rather offended at how he even speculated on whether or not Shakespeare really loved his wife Anne (though at least in the end he admitted that it was very possible he always loved her).  There was even some joking, when he was looking at the church record of their marriage, about how this 18 year old boy was being ""forced"" to marry this ""long in the tooth"" woman who was 8 years his senior.  While it's true that Anne Hathaway was pregnant when they married, there's no evidence other than conjecture that this was a shotgun marriage.  Is it really that unthinkable that an 18 year old boy could fall madly in love with a woman that much older, and truly want to marry her independent of the fact that he got her pregnant?  I seriously doubt that there would be this question of whether he actually loved his wife if he had been the 26 year old and she had been the 18 year old.  I say more power to him for picking an older woman to be his wife and going against the hypocritical convention in which it's normal and socially acceptable for the husband to be older, but suspect or strange when it's the wife who is older.  We also hear the beautiful early sonnet he wrote to her, with the concluding line declaring ""And saved my life,"" which sounds like ""Anne saved my life"" when read aloud.

All in all, it's a great introduction to the Bard, for both devotees and people who aren't that familiar with his life, times, or works yet.  It's guaranteed to amaze those who never thought of him as so interesting, modern, lively, and accessible.",1173830400,29,5538,4.544265593561368
1982885,5,B00019JRFY,"An excellent film that documents the ideas and pressures that tore at Shakespeare's soul in Elizabethan England. The photography is colorful and well done. The use of modern day actors to present dialogue from his plays gives the film a ""flesh and blood"" reality.

His challenge to all of us, hurled across five centuries, inspired by the savage persecution and execution of his distant cousin at the hands of Elizabeth's torturers, is to write and speak what we truly feel, not what conformism, fashion, expedience, and careerism would have us say.
