8613346,5,B00F996BVO,"I am loving watching these episodes.  It seems you cannot watch any other Britcom without the characters referring to (or actually watching!) this show.  How wonderful to see a different kind of soap opera than American ones, where the emphasis is on the humourous situations we find ourselves in every day.  The pathos is there too, of course, only not too much, and not too tortured.  You know a laugh is just around the bend.  Also, it's fun seeing actors in their younger days who went on to become noted for other roles.  Geoffrey Hughes, who plays Onslow in Keeping Up Appearances, is a young wheeler-dealer called Eddie Yates, and mates with Hilda Ogden, played by Jean Alexander.  You might know her as Auntie Wainwright on Last of the Summer Wine.  She is spot-on here as a harridan housewife, with her hair in perpetual curlers, nagging her hubby with a ""bad back"", Stan.  Mollie Sugden, Mrs. Slocombe on Are You Being Served?, did several episodes, as did a VERY young Anne Reid, whom we know from the recent remake of Upstairs Downstairs as the cook, as well as playing with Derek Jacobi in Last Tango in Halifax.  Of course, some of the characters stayed until the end - theirs, of course, as the show is still going strong on British TV.  Highly recommend this series for Anglophiles and soap junkies alike.
