8088433,5,B000BKVRJW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this candid view of these Russian superstars in preparation and performance.  I was fascinated by the Russian dancers and how they applied their makeup and carried on in a scene where they just all tried to outdance each other after a performance.  The views of them rehearsing outside with local people watching was the sort of thing I love to watch even more than actual performances because I like to see how they work on their craft.  I was also impressed with the final product of their labors, especially of a rather modern pas de deux set to the music of the great church hymn, Crucifux, which I sang in church choir and loved to perform.  If you like to view commentary-type DVDs, this one is for you.",1139356800,15,730,4.549618320610687
