6300489,3,B00IWT576S,"Though this 12 DVD set is comprised of officially-licensed, restored transfers beware that it was produced for the Indian market and the discs are all vanilla (plain), save for a few trailers. They're lacking the copious extras and subtitles included in the US-produced Image, mk2/Warner or Criterion label releases. Not much of a bargain then.
