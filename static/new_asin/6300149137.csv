7803439,5,6300149137,"Catastrophe, narrated by Wm. Conrad, is a collection of disaster stories from the '70s, including Hurricane Camille, the '74 Xenia Ohio tornado, the Dust Bowl, the '73 Indy 500, and two other stories. While many more catastrophes and disasters have happened in the subsequent 45 years, this is a very interesting collection. Unfortunately it was never released on dvd",1502668800,,367,5.237288135593221

7803442,5,6300149137,"This docu-drama is a compilation of historical events that are well recorded for posterity. From Hurricane Camille to the Sao Paolo hi- rise disaster, narrerated by William Conrad. While some, like Hurricane Camille, were major events by themselves, The Tornado at Xenia, Ohio was part of a larger event known as the Super Outbreak in 1974. If one is into historical disasters this is a great film to have as these events were recorded as they happened. I sincerely hope this film makes it one day to DVD as it should not be allowed to fade away like so many others, even though many of the events they depicted have since been overshadowed by larger events since. One can always learn something from disasters and the past can still teach us.",1376006400,,743,4.679389312977099
7803443,5,6300149137,Used it in history class not only for its historical content but as a tool for teaching study skills such as notetaking.  Always enjoy hearing Bill Conrad's booming baritone as well as watching the archival film footage.  Every event was in the 1970's but each still has a lesson of history for us today.,1289606400,,304,4.611111111111111

This is an awesome documentary !",1266364800,,304,3.9508196721311477
7803445,4,6300149137,"Deftly narrated by William Conrad, CATASTROPHE (1978) presents mostly color footage of several types of natural and man-made disasters. This 90 minute documentary is somewhat dated, as modern calamities (space shuttle explosions, terrorist attacks, etc.) are absent. There's also selectivity in material covered: we see no plane crashes, train wrecks, bridge collapses or forest fires, for example. Eeriest of all is a prediction that tragically became reality over 20 years after this film was released.

As of 2/09, ""Catastrophe"" was not available on DVD.
