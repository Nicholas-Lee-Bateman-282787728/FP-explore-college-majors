8729388,5,B0142PZXH8,"I didn't get to see this show when it originally aired on Showtime, but bought it on a friend recommendation. This show is Fabulous, Supernatural, Intriguing, Suspense, and a Horror story rolled up into one. After I viewed the first episode I was hooked. I wish I could have seen Penny Dreadful when it originally aired. And Sad that the show was canceled before I could enjoy this magnificent tv show. At least it's on DVD so I can binge watch it over and over again my favorite episodes.",1473206400,,489,4.50561797752809
