8602711,1,B00E8SGPJU,I usually care for Bob's workouts but just did not like this one. The first segment was mainly squats and so dull I kept watching the clock. I put this on a back shelf and have not taken it out again since that first time,1416182400,2,221,3.933333333333333
8602712,5,B00E8SGPJU,"I rely on Bob to regulary kick my butt with his dvds, and this was no execption. Even better, it did so in a much shorter timeframe...these are 15 minute workouts following the HIIT trend. I can easily do them in the morning before work, and I feel like I did a much longer workout when I am done. My only issue was that the ""warmup"" was a separate section, and too long, in my opinion. Other than that, this has become my go to dvd during the workweek!",1382572800,12,453,4.101123595505618
