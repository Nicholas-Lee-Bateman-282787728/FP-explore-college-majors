8114167,5,B000ETRTWE,"I bought this DVD, not realizing it was from 5 years ago.  I was extremely impressed by the presentation of this production, with excellent video quality and a good audio mix (maybe the audio level is a tad low, but everything is there).  This video reveals that Vicci Martinez and her band are completely professional and ready to deliver the goods, which they do in abundance on this DVD, which is about 103 minutes long.  There are 17 songs in all, some rather long but thoroughly enjoyable, that display the versatility of this young woman and her band.  Blues flavors, ballads, rockin' fire,  you name it, it's in there.  It's hard to put a Genre tag on what Vicci is doing here, as it doesn't fit neatly within the confines of rock, or blues, or even pop, but it is powerful, gentle, emotional, personable, intimate, fun, and very well delivered.  (Rod Cook on lead guitar is a treasure in his own right.)

The DVD also includes a documentary, a photo gallery and some outtakes, which are interesting and kind of fun.  This material reveals the personal nature of Vicci's music, and shows her for the somewhat humble, genuine, and sweet person that she is, and that she has chosen to do it HER WAY.

She is now a seasoned veteran, having been performing for more than ten years, and this moment of time in her rise to greatness is a gem that should be treasured by anyone who cares about Vicci Martinez' music.

I applaud Vicci, who wrote most of tunes herself (Love Is the Only Proof,  Joyride and Sunshine co-written with Abigail J. Fein) and developed the arrangements with her impressive band.  If you want to have an enjoyable time, definitely buy this DVD NOW.  You will have a most rewarding experience.
