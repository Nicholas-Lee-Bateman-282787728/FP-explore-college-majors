Chip breaks it down. I bought this for my seven year old. He is a little small for some of the tricks, nah, he surprised us and was able to master the fake spin in a week. He watches the video over and over.
Chip is a fantastic teacher!",1203638400,4,275,4.0

Now, let's talk about the focus on Stick Tricks: Showmanship. I am floored by Chip's innovative use of spins, twirls, tosses, juggling etc. Each ""trick"" is explained in detail and is also displayed in slow motion. This is very helpful because it sends you on the path for being able to incorporate stick tricks in to ""your"" playing. Also, there is a ton of live footage of Chip performing with various bands. It's great to see how the concepts that he teaches are applied in real musical situations.

Stick Tricks is an extremely entertaining video. I've only had it a few days and have been watching it non stop. I highly recommend it!",1200960000,7,870,4.6797385620915035
