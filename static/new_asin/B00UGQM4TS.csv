8706684,5,B00UGQM4TS,"The grand finale of the Harry Potter series is so grand it took two movies. Part 1 has Voldemort's death eaters and snatchers wreaking havoc across the magic community.  Harry and his friends Hermione and Ron go on the run from an interrupted wedding, seeking the Horcruxes that are the secret to the Dark Lord's power.  The expedition involves sneaking into the Ministry of Magic in London, in disguise, and roaming the countryside on the hunt for a missing sword, while relying on Hermione's seemingly bottomless bag of tricks.

This is a tough episode. The young trio are very much on their own, and the strain is showing.  Harry's endless courage has to be balanced by the smarts of Hermione and the good sense of Ron.  A nearly fatal encounter with Voldemort's minions is resolved with the help of an old friend of Harry's but not without cost...

The Deathly Hallows, Parts 1 and 2, show the Harry Potter team at its very best.  A great storyline comes to life thanks to fantastic production values and seamless movie magic, whether inside Hogwarts or in London, or in a remote glen in Scotland.  Very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1486684800,,1149,4.71
