4445101,5,B004QC6HKK,"Have just watched this on UK TV and apart from being a wonderful Love Story it also highlights the problems facing a 'commoner' is presented with when becoming a member of the Royal Family.

The story goes some way yo explain the workings of what is probably the most famous Royal Family in the World. In my opinion this is a must watch movie.",1303603200,5,343,4.359375
4445102,3,B004QC6HKK,"PLOT: Lifetime FAST throw together tale~  that attempts to show the romance of William Prince of Wales and Kate Middleton.

Nico Evers Swindee~(PRINCE WILLIAM) vaguely looks like him~ who starts his college years at Saint Andrews in Scotland. the girls toss themselves at William his first days at the college where everyone signs privacy decree to maintain Williams privacy. There is humor here in the BORING art class where the main ""draw"" is the prince. At Christmas William is seen whining to Prince Charles (BEN CROSS) how ""miserable"" he is and how he misses the city. A friendship builds between Camilla Luddington (KATE MIDDLETON)~ and Willam and a group of FRIENDS get a large aparment together. After a FASHION show where a sexy skimpy outfit has William seeing the sexy side of Kate. Soon the couple are sneaking in and out of each others bedrooms. When Kate is invite to a ""Royal Event"" and ignored by William the first crack in their relationship. Kate is soon mingling with the Royals. Williams serinade to Kate in a very off key voice is more sad than romantic. Kate is suddenly in a media frenzy as Williams new ""girlfriend"". This goes the whole way with the UPS and downs of the romance including catty friends.
the first mention of Love is when William and Kate share a cottage their last year at Saint Andrews. this moves along fast to gloss over the nearly 10 years of relationship. The Press stalk Kate ruthlessly. Charles comes across as cold and unfeeling as he turns down Williams request for bodyguards for Kate. the ONLY real english accent comes from VICTORIA TENNANT~ who shows Kate ""royal protical""~. William pushes Kate away and they officially break up. time apart makes William reflect on what he has lost. when he finally gets around to call Kate she is ""busy""~ (LOL!) ""best ACTED scene"" in the entire movie is Charles and William discussing the life of Diana his mother~ too bad they waited to ADD a GREAT scene in the last 10 minutes. The ending is worth the watch as William finally tracks down Kate to show how much he missed her and loves her.  and finally the ""surpise"" proposal in Africa.

this was filmed entirely in Los Angles. the FAST project was packaged and ready in under 3 months. Nico Evers Swindee is very likeable as William. Ben Cross has Prince Charles voice down ""perfect"" and gives him a cold image in this film. Camilla Luddington is lovely.  All the Royals are portrayed as shallow and sometimes whiners. I LIKED IT. WORTH WATCHING ONCE~ I GIVE IT THREE OUT OF FIVE. WRITTEN LIKE A TELL ALL BOOK~ AT TIMES SO BAD IT IS GOOD~ no doubt a modern cult classic.",1303084800,5,2612,4.657266811279826

I'm glad that William is being his own person for the most part and showing that just because he is in line for the throne doesn't mean he can't have his own life.

4445194,4,B004QC6HKK,"Charming at times but disjointed at other instances, this film makes a valiant attempt to merge what is known about the courtship of William and Katherine with speculation.  That being said, one should take this for what it is, a love story which transcends class, time, and history.  Most of the actors performances are quite enjoyable and appear true to form.  While this isn't an Oscar worthy film, it is one of the stronger productions of the Lifetime Movie Network.  If you enjoyed The Prince and Me or Another Cinderella Story, this picture is right up your alley as the plot-development is similar.  I do wish the film would have included coverage beyond the proposal but understand that the story had to be told in a limited amount of time.  The time constraints unfortunately resulted in the sense of jumping from documented event to event with a rush after their college graduation to get to the proposal.  If the end of the film was as well structured as the beginning, which took its time to tell the love story, the film would be better rated.
Please note this review is from Greg's wife as he would consider watching this move a fate worse than joining his wife in her monthly women's book club.  He would note that this film provided him with ample time to watch Band of Brothers and work in the garage.",1421625600,9,1318,4.602564102564102
4445195,5,B004QC6HKK,"I have watched this movie 4 times already! It is a sweet romance with ups and downs. I think both lead actors were totally believable in their roles. I think that William was given less to work with in terms of lines as the story focuses on Catherine's reactions so we don't get as much insight into him. I know the critics blasted this but the film was a big success with VIEWERS and looks like other people are watching it multiple times as well. I felt the storyline was believable and the script was good. Don't understand all the nay saying -- look this wasn't made to win an Oscar but to win hearts instead. And it has done just that. I thank the filmmakers for taking the risk to make this. It is a story the public wanted to hear and they did a good job. I think this is a story that resonates on a lot of levels. For me, it was an opportunity to ""relive"" my 20s -- in a different way, one that is healing for me.",1420329600,,921,4.065934065934066

But this movie was cobbled together too quickly to take advantage of the interest surrounding William and Kate since their engagement. The constant reuse of sets - especially the staircase to what supposedly was Buckingham Palace was a joke - that building has been used in so many shows i.e. Less than Zero, Chuck and Castle - it wasn't convincing.

You watch it to understand some of the issues dealt with by William and Kate and you watch it to gain a better perspective of lessons the Royals have learned regarding paparazzi and it's perpetual pursuit.

It's the beginning of a romance that has no end where such stories as Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty live in all of us Such stories have stood the test of time. William & Kate serves to bring to the surface the Happily Ever After we all seek at one time or other and its done without being cheesy.

I was bothered the whole time by the fact that the actors look nothing like the real Will and Kate, and it doesn't seem like the movie gives any additional insight into their relationship that hasn't been excessively covered in the news. However, if you just need to zonk out by the TV with some fluff to watch that isn't absolutely terrible, just marginally bad, this might do the trick.

I, however, have royal fever, and am absolutely delighted by this film. The acting is off-and-on (think Harry in the Philosopher's Stone-- ""Why didn't I see it befor!?"") and the first half is pretty dull.
I can't say what draws me to it, but every day at the gym I start the film and hop on the treadmill. It keeps me entertained--especially those lovely bits like ""I insist on organic""; ""I love the public you; I love the private you; and I love the you that nobody gets to see but me""; it goes on and on!

The acting was at best decent but I think that the scriptwriters should have put better lines and more facts in the movie but with all the hype the Royal Wedding caused they had to make the movie into some sappy romance.",1308009600,,504,4.101010101010101
4445259,5,B004QC6HKK,"This movie is largely based on conjecture so viewers need to get past the sugary sappy romance emotion to see why this movie is a gem rather than taking jabs at the ""feminist"" movement and such and looking for anything political here. It tells it's own version of events leading up to the engagement of William and Kate...IT IS A ROMANCE story--period.  It is not meant to illustrate historical fact and such but to entertain--and that it does.

Nico was great as Prince William but I didn't feel that Ms. Luddington fared as well in her portrayal of Kate Middleton simply because there were times that her accent appeared to sound incorrect.  The best scene in the whole movie was between Ben Cross and Nico where Diana was being discussed.  Furthermore, Cross made the prince look pretty darned good--right down to the expressions in scenes where the media had their ""fun"" and the cufflink twirl. I feel that that scene alone between Cross and Nico is worth a nod at award time--even though nobody knows if this conversation ever really happened.

Once again, Ben Cross delivers in a role and he doesn't let down the audience. Hopefully, when ""A Common Man"" is released later this year (where he stars with Sir Ben Kingsley), he will finally get the respect and recognition for his work that he truly deserves.",1307059200,4,1312,4.7368421052631575

I found it touching.  Kate is so innocent, and William such a typical adolescent male.  Their story is so typical of a wealthy established young man who falls madly in love with a girl who comes from a slightly less wealthy family (who's fortune is not supported by the taxpayers).  William almost ruins the affair (and almost the possibility of allowing us to voyeuristically allow us to watch their wedding), and for that Kate's girlfriends and I will never fully trust him.

Prince or not, the ladies out there should find Nico Evers-Swindell a pleasure to watch and the guys may just fall for Camilla Luddington at Kate.

4445266,5,B004QC6HKK,"Martin Scorsese & Stephen Spielberg need to watch this. It's an example of how to make a real movie.
Perhaps the most exciting cinematic event since Gone With The Wind.

Directed by the talented Mark Rosman (Lizzie McGuire, Ghost Whisperer) this charming Nancy Silvers penned film (Miracle in Manhattan, About Sarah) is the perfect tribute to a Royal love affair that has garnered worldwide fascination.

The delightful Camilla Luddington plays the role of Kate Middleton to perfection. Having gained critical acclaim for her role in the 1997 film 'A Couple of White Chicks at the Hairdresser', the star of 'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' and 'The Filming of Shakey Willis' has managed, at short notice (the announcement was only made last November) to portray Miss Middleton with sensitivity, empathy and charm. Director Rosman's production includes further impressive casting: Nico Evers-Swindell plays Prince William with the same compassion and thoughtfulness the world has come to recognise in the young Prince.
The entire production, while filmed in USA, featured buildings similar to those in London and St Andrews, the oldest university in Scotland. Special praise should be reserved for the street scenes featuring iconic red London buses and almost identical architecture and realistic crowd scenes.

The love story is portrayed with poise as the dreamy passion of young love is forced to face the stark reality of Royal life and the inevitable pressure this involves. Prince Charles is played by the veteran British actor Ben Cross, who famously ran through the St Andrews surf as Olympic athlete Harold Abrahams in the Oscar-winning film Chariots of Fire.
With a strong supporting cast including the stunning Serena Scott Thomas as Carole Middleton and Justin Hanlon, star of 2008 movie 'whore' who portrays Prince Harry with charisma and energy.
Finally, if there is one criticism that will doubtless be echoed by many viewers - the 83min production could have been longer. However, with such short notice this very British love affair has received a wonderful pre-marriage tribute.",1303603200,,2097,5.3102409638554215
