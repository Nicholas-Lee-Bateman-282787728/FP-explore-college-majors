7951071,5,B00005QW4S,"""And summer's lease hath all too short a date."" from Shakespeare's sonnet XVIII

The ""Darling Buds of May"" is a 1991 TV series about a quite unconventional and flamboyant family in rural England in the 1950s.

While each episode is unique and fun to watch and actually picked up the series to see the early works of Catherine Zeta-Jones playing the part of Mariette the voluptuous daughter in the family. Little did I know that I would fall in love with all the characters.

I came to this series originally after watching ""The Mating Game"" starring Debbie Reynolds, Tony Randall, Paul Douglas, and Fred Clark, which is more of a PG comedy based on the same characters based on  first book of ""The Darling buds of May"" written by  H.E. BATES;  which was written and set in 1958.

7951072,4,B00005QW4S,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this 2nd dvd. Pop, Ma, CHarlie, and the Major are spot-on! Just a litle jarring with the change of actress for the next oldest daughter. Mariette is as lovely as ever, as a new mom. Pop's womanizing is still funny, Anna Massey does have a problem with her French accent though. All in all, I would certainly recommend this dvd to any one who enjoys British Comedy at it's best!",1272499200,,403,4.45945945945946
7951073,5,B00005QW4S,"As a former Ontario (Canada) girl I love many British movies and TV shows. While on a recent visit to my 70+ year old parents in St. Thomas, they brought out their new favorite ""The Darling Buds of May"". You do need to see these first before the France story. We enjoyed watching something together that was entertaining for 3 generations of our family. The characters were loveable, the English countryside beautiful and the story line held our attention through several episodes before we realized it was very late at night. This was ""perfec"" as pa would say often with a contented sigh.",1217203200,,589,4.728155339805825
7951074,4,B00005QW4S,"In this 4 story series, we resume the story of the irrepressible Larkins family with the wonderful David Jason as Pop Larkin, Pam Ferris as plump, jolly Ma Larkin and Catherine Zeta-Jones as the luscious elder daughter, Mariette. In the first story, Mariette gives birth to John Blenheim, the Larkin's first grandchild, and the second daughter sets her mind to capturing the new Vicar. The following stories continue with the sudden appearance of a handsome foreigner, a visit from Mam'selle Dupont and the entry of the Larkin's son and heir, Montgomery, to the Naval Academy for Merchant Seamen. It's a light hearted look at England in the 1950's and full of good humour.",1213660800,4,672,4.95575221238938
7951075,5,B00005QW4S,It's great to be able to watch some enjoyable Tv again.  Watching Ma and Pa Larkin having fun with their children it's something we don't see much of on tv these days.  My children love Darling Buds of May and I feel comfortable about them watching it.  For me it's a trip down memory lane watching them all again.,1168473600,,314,4.288135593220339
7951076,4,B00005QW4S,"THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY (Vol. 2, Breath of French Air) comprises the second four 50-minute episodes from the British telly series originally broadcast in May 1991 and January/February 1992 on Yorkshire Television.
The series revolves around the Larkin family: Sidney ""Pop"" Larkin (David Jason), ""Ma"" Larkin (Pam Ferris), daughter Mariette (Catherine Zeta Jones), sons Oscar and Montgomery, daughters Primrose, Petunia, Zinnia, and Victoria, and Mariette's new husband ""Charley"" Charlton (Philip Franks). And, by the way, Ma isn't married to Pop; her real character name is Flo Parker. Living in sin doesn't prevent fruitful multiplication, apparently, even in the realm of the Church of England.
It's the early 1950s, and Pop Larkin owns 22 acres of farmland in Kent. His family's lifestyle indicates a comfortable prosperity. Perhaps it's because of the under-the-table deals Pop has going on the side. And it doesn't hurt his bottom line that he's never filed an income tax declaration or paid into social insurance. Sidney is a charming rascal, especially with the women.
In the first two episodes, the extended Larkin family spends a holiday on the Brittany coast at a somewhat threadbare hotel. French hospitality is markedly cool until the staff misperceives Pop to be a British lord. You see, Pop drives an old, classic, yellow Rolls Royce purchased from a cash-strapped member of the English landed gentry. The seller's initials, ""SL"", which are emblazoned on the side of the car in ornate lettering, are the same as Pop's. Anyway, Sidney doesn't disabuse his hosts of their mistaken notion, even allowing the female owner to relinquish her room to Ma and Pop for their increased comfort. In the meantime, Charley is attacked by the Green-Eyed Monster when the young men on the beach show a sunbathing Mariette too much attention. The newlyweds have their first tiff.
In the second two episodes, it's almost a year later, and Mariette delivers her first child. Amidst all this wedded bliss, Charley is feeling pangs of inadequacy as his father-in-law provides the Charltons with everything. Charley is on the lookout for self-reliance and a money-making opportunity, such as discovering a method to successfully freeze strawberries. Across the fence in the main Larkin house, the second oldest daughter, Primrose, now 15, is developing a crush on the young vicar, Mr. Candy, who's tasked with performing the christening ceremony not only for the Charlton infant, but also for all the Larkin children, none of whom have been baptized in the Church. Things get more interesting when the owner of that French hotel, still thinking Pop is a ""milord"", arrives on a visit.
I gave Volume 1 of the series three stars, calling it ""bucolic"". But, you know, it's growing on me. I don't think I'll ever give any of the five volumes 5 stars, but four stars for this disc is an indication of my increasing appreciation for this gentle, amusing and happy series. It's also intriguing to see how the scriptwriters are beginning to bring the younger Larkin children into the mainstream of the plot as they get older. This aspect reminds me of the evolution of that long-running U.S. TV series, THE WALTONS. Not a shabby comparison, that.",1061856000,4,3228,5.092452830188679
