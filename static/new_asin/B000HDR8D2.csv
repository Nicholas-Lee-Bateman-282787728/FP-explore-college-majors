8138751,5,B000HDR8D2,"This DVD contains 3 really fun episodes from different seasons that all feature Bulbasaur.  In ""Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village"" (Episode #10 in Season 1: Indigo League) Ash, Misty, & Brock come across a village of weak and injured Pokmon being protected by a Bulbasaur. By the end of the episode Bulbasaur ends up joining Ash on his journey. The second episode on this disc is Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden (Episode #49 in Season 1: Indigo League). During this episode is taken to a garden by a bunch of other Bulbasaur so it can evolve during a special Bulbasaur Festival but Ash's Bulbasaur doesn't want to evolve. This is a fun episode that I really enjoyed. The last episode on this disc is Bulbasaur, the Ambassador! (Episode #16 in Season 5: Master Quest) and it involves Professor Oak having Ash send his Bulbasaur to help settle a dispute between some of the Grass and Water Pokmon. All three episodes on this disc are a lot of fun and great for any Bulbasaur fan.",1483488000,,974,4.662790697674419
