2013515,5,B0001LYFGI,"The war in Texas of 1835-36 is a very large subject, far larger than the American public probably realizes.  No one documentary can be expected to provide more than a very brief introduction.  There is a long interview with historian Stephen L. Hardin, author of ""Texian Iliad,"" the best summary history of the conflict.

For some historical subjects, there is an interesting history of the history.  The Alamo forms one such subject, and that history of the history is not overlooked here.  For example, there is a segment on the phenomenal Davy Crockett craze of the 1950s.  There is some discussion of the many movies, which form a large subject in itself.",1206057600,,659,4.839285714285714
2013516,1,B0001LYFGI,"I rented this documentary to learn more of the Alamo and history behind it. As with other documentaries I have seen, I expected this to give a thorough history, events leading up to the famous battle, and go in depth about details concerning it. Never have I watched a documentary that was more ambiguous. This was poorly filmed, poorly directed, and has poor content. Davy Crockett memorabilia, a thorough review of movies made about the Alamo, and actual reenactments done in TX (wherein the narrator cannot be heard over the gunshots, and those reenacting are interviewed about why they participated etc.), make up the bulk of this movie. There is more said about John Wayne and other portrayals of Davy Crockett than of the real man and circumstances themselves. Yes, there is a little bit of history given throughout and at the tail end, and a mention of the battle of Behar, but very little said about the Alamo. In other words, if you tried showing this to someone with no prior knowledge of the Alamo they would not, at the conclusion, be able to tell you what happened there except very broad facts of people and places involved. Do not waste your time or money on this. The only upside is that this documentary is only an hour and fifteen minutes, so you can't waste too much time on it if you do watch it.",1201219200,12,1316,4.580508474576271
2013517,1,B0001LYFGI,"It just rambles on and on. Lots of footage from old movies. Not much history. A long, boring re-enactment of some other battle, not the Alamo or San Jacinto. Meaningless interviews with people that have nothing to do with the history of the Alamo. Who cares about collectors of memorabilia? Lots of long-winded conversations. Just boring and pointless. Save your money on this one. I wish that I had done so.",1189036800,3,408,4.76056338028169
2013518,3,B0001LYFGI,"I thought the film was informative. During the early part of the film there was a lot of history, interesting observations from both sides of the war. But I was bored to tears when they began the Davey Crockett memorabilia segment. But if you are a Texas history buff, it is worth spending the time watching. I particularly enjoyed the black and white segments that were add ins. Quite humorus.",1173312000,,394,4.642857142857143
2013519,3,B0001LYFGI,"Richard Reyes Flores is a very smart man with an insightful take on how ""the Alamo"" became such a huge deal, and so destructive to real live human beings.  This documentary, however, doesn't do Flores'  profound analysis justice.  Better to read _Remembering the Alamo: Memory, modernity and the mastery symbol_(2002), his edited volume of Adina de Zavala's writings, his book about _los Pastores_, or one of his articles (Google Scholar will help you out there)....Relative to other Alamo productions (yuck), this film is excellent, but in itself, just okay.",1153267200,3,559,5.258426966292135
2013520,4,B0001LYFGI,"This documentary explores the history and pop culture as no other has done before: it explores how the Alamo became a cultural icon, and tours Alamo collections (including some rare John Wayne memorabilia!).  There is also a re-enactment battle scene, which I found rather interesting as I may not ever get a chance to see it in person.
This DVD is a rather fascinating look at things about the Alamo that you never knew before.  There is an introduction by Frank Thompson, noted Alamo authority!",1082419200,15,496,4.823529411764706

8014310,1,B0001LYFGI,"I've only made it through about half of this trash and don't think I can go any further. This is the worst ""documentary"" on a major historical event that I've ever seen!!! Who the hell cares about previous movies made about the Alamo??? I'm begging you to ignore this piece of junk. The people who gave this ""film"" 5 stars should never be allowed to review another thing on Amazon.
Simply put, if you're looking for history you MUST NOT buy this. In fact....if you insist on torturing yourself, put your email address in a comment to this review, I'll write to you, and will send you this thing for FREE....including whatever it costs to mail it.
Just don't hold me libel for stealing away 2 hours of your life.",1380240000,4,711,4.476923076923077
8014311,5,B0001LYFGI,"Great documentary reviews the Alamo: in truth and in Film. There have been a number of films lionizing the Alamo's defenders. It is justified but is it truly accurate? It was a final ""battle"" that was over in just minutes- AND with few credited witnesses. Confusion abounds!
  Common sense says that the reload time for the flintlock of the day was just under a minuet, so did Davy really go down swinging as ofttimes depicted- or was it more likely that he had been captured and summarily executed?
  There have been a number of films on the topic and they are competently reviewed in this documentary. View this as a guide to take you to your favorite Alamo Films and choose as you wish.",1359331200,,689,4.532258064516129
8014312,5,B0001LYFGI,"This DVD is great either for Alamo buffs or beginners. It covers everything from the actual historical facts to reenactments and film adaptations.  Alamo expert Frank Thompson is on hand as unofficial host to guide viewers through all these aspects and does a fine job.  My favorite section was ""The Crockett Craze"",  about the mid-50s fad that swept the nation.  I was 6 at the time and recall it well.  I didn't know how many products resulted from the fad until now, however.  Also included is an abridged version of the 1937 film ""Heroes of the Alamo"", which host Thompson correctly dubs as ""God-awful"".  All in all, great fun and educational.",1353283200,,647,4.774774774774775
8014313,4,B0001LYFGI,"I use this documentary in my classroom to talk about the mythology of Texas: how Texas is viewed by other parts of the country, how the ideas of individualism and courage are mythologized by the battle of the Alamo, and how Texas itself is affected by these legends and images. Granted it is not the best documentary ever made, but the movie clips, memorabilia, and re-enactment scenes are great for getting as sense of how the Alamo is such a strong part of creating the myth of American exceptionalism.",1264809600,4,504,4.674157303370786
8014314,2,B0001LYFGI,"The Bottom Line:

The Alamo Documentary, despite the definitive nature of the title, does not tell any sort of history of the battle, instead talking with some success (with very limited resources and almost no film clips) about the films which have been made about the battle and then regrettably switching into a self-congratulatory and indulgent hagiography of the ""San Antonio Living History"" society, which makes for exceptionally dull filmmaking; if you are interested in the Alamo itself, stay away from this bore.

2/4",1250294400,5,526,5.25
8014315,1,B0001LYFGI,"I was hoping for history of the Alamo, what I got was first, a history of Alamo movies, second, history the fifties Davy Crockett fad, third, a guide tour of Alamo tourist memorabilia, fourth, reenactors giving misinformation in the form of historical opinion, and finally, about who is allowed to be a member of the Daughter of the Texas Republic organization.

If you want history don't waste your money on this DVD.",1233446400,6,418,4.805555555555555
