Dan Ivan,Douglas Ivan and Gary Pitts all Shito-Ryu Black-Belts.
  Great Fighting Scenes a more Realistic Ninja Film.
The tape of course is old but; it was a good buy.",1369699200,,254,4.5

7872659,1,6304479166,"This steaming pile of excrement stars the one and only Doug Ivan as the half Japanese, half Italian ninja Kwanji. I won't waste any time describing the plot of this movie, just know that the force of the ninja involves running away from the bad guys until they get tired of chasing and give up. Only then does Kwanji leap from the shadows to deliver the death blow, usually in the form of foam Chinese stars. If you do rent this movie, if you can even find it, make sure you watch the previews, they are the funniest 10 minutes of film I have ever seen. This movie deserves no stars, but one is as low as this thing lets me go.",985046400,,627,4.147540983606557
