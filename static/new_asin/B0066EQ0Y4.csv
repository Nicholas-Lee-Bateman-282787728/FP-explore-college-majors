4962533,5,B0066EQ0Y4,"This is not a compensated review. I bought the DVD and book on my own.

Have you heard about The Fat Chick? She has an exercise program for new exercisers so they ease into an exercise routine.

Repeatedly, I have started exercising, only to hurt myself along the way. I get discouraged. I stop exercising. My entire body seizes up.

Because of inflammatory arthritis that comes with having The Syndrome (aka Sjogren's Syndrome) that has more lupus and rheumatoid symptoms than the dryness that comes from Sjogren's, I am encouraged to move. Moving keeps the joints lubricated, making every day life a lot easier.

Last fall I attempted a back to basics class at the park district and failed. I ended up with sore knees and ankles, which defeats the whole idea of regular exercise. You can't exercise regularly if you can barely walk.

So I was excited to hear about The Fat Chick and her DVD. Honestly, I don't know where I heard about her, but I think it was over at Ragen Chastain's Dances With Fat. These two remarkable women--Regan and Jeanette DePatie (aka The Fat Chick) have joined forces and started the wonderful forum for fat people who are fit (or trying to be) at FitFatties. Check it out if you want inspiration and help!

I ordered my DVD and reluctantly pushed it into the DVD player. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised! Actually, I was humiliated to only work out for less than 15 minutes the first time. Seriously...15 minutes?!

I decided to trust The Fat Chick and follow her DVD to the letter. I also got her ebook so I could learn even more. That's how I am when I start something new--I want to learn everything!

The amazing thing: I don't hurt when I am done working out. There are some muscle pains that come from doing something new, but that's normal. I am not experiencing any of the pain that makes it hard to walk up the stairs. I feel looser and more limber.

I am also doing tai chi at the park district and love it. For years I have heard that this is a nice low impact, soothing way to gain strength and flexibility. It helps that the other people in the class are hilarious and make the hour fly by.

Today I started week 4 of The Fat Chick's DVD. Each week's section of the DVD features a talk from The Fat Chick, a lesson on any new moves, and the week's routine. There aren't leotard-wearing models doing the moves--they look like regular women.

Up to now I've been doing The Fat Chick's work out three times a week, plus an hour of tai chi. But I think I'll add another Fat Chick session to my week. Because I feel like I want more.

Since I am competitive by nature, I like moving into a new week. I feel a sense of accomplishment.

This DVD isn't just for fat people, by the way. Anyone new to exercise should give this a try. It's a nice change of pace to start an exercise program without ending up hurt or in pain.

Right now my goal is to get through the DVD. Then we'll see where I go after that!

Oh, and every time I work out I tweet #goldstar. Seriously, we don't get enough gold stars in life, so join in when you need one for anything!",1337904000,33,3115,4.355785837651123
4962534,3,B0066EQ0Y4,"This simple, straightforward workout and the brief instructor talk can get you off the couch and moving (again). You can easily adapt the exercises to any fit level. But, beware: the production values aren't good and it's a bit short on creativity in the moves and the music. The best part is seeing yourself reflected among the women on the DVD who are exercising, succeeding at it, and enjoying it. It's more an inspiration piece than a DVD we actually use a lot. Thanks for providing this alternative view of home exercise instructors and students--it's an important contribution to the landscape and hopefully the next one in the series will be improved.",1335225600,11,658,4.883928571428571
4962535,5,B0066EQ0Y4,"A little background about me:  I am 375lbs and 5 feet 9 inches tall.  Last year I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and have lost a significant amount of mobility (not not mention gaining 115lbs).  I went from being someone who was mountain biking 10-15 miles per trip to having to have my husband help me stand up or get out of bed.  Life was utterly miserable and even the prescribed percocet wasn't helping.  I had days where I sat down and cried because I'm not even 29 yet and my body felt like it was 80.

Fast forward to February 2012:  An amazing doctor finally figured out that I also had Celiac disease.  After changing to a gluten free diet, I started to regain some of my mobility and strength as my body began to get nutrition again.  I finally felt like doing something again but going to the gym to work out was significantly beyond my ability at the moment.  Then I found the Fat Chick!

Yesterday was the first time I worked out with the DVD.  The DVD is broken down into different weeks, each week adds a little more to the work out as you slowly build up endurance.  I started with week one and was guided through a small warm up, short aerobic workout (maybe 5 minutes?) and then a cool down that was similar to the warm up.  For me, this worked up a sweat, got my heart rate up a little, but didn't ""overwork"" me.  When I was done with the workout I thought ""I can do this"". Best feeling ever after the health issues I've been through!  That night I slept well, and woke up feeling a very moderate amount of soreness to my muscles (the good sore! not the fibromyalgia sore!).

I will update my review as I have used more of the DVD.  At this point though, I was so elated to find a DVD that worked for me.  The Fat Chick Works out reminds of of the Leslie Sansone workouts of Walk Away The Pounds only better because The Fat Chick isn't focused on weight loss.  Since I practice Health At Every Size (HAES) this was always distracting to me to use a work out dvd that promised you weight loss and shiny rainbows and the perfect life once you weren't fat.  The Fat Chick is not that sort of work out DVD.  The leader is funny, cheerful, and encouraging and you can watch different ""Peep Talks"" to help keep you motivated while you work out.

I think this is a fantastic video for beginners since I consider myself a certified, grade-a, beginner :).  If you're like me and you are trying to start slow and recover a relationship with your body - - -this is the DVD to help you with that.",1329264000,90,2504,4.245243128964059

4962540,5,B0066EQ0Y4,"The year was 1995. I was in the best shape of my life and powering through The Firm workouts was like strolling in the mall! Then I injured my back at work and couldn't exercise without debilitating pain. Fast forward to 2013 - 18 years and 130 pounds gained. I was desperate to find a workout I could do but all the ""beginner"" workouts were obviously not workouts for women like me. I don't even remember how I found The Fat Chick, but I am incredibly thankful that I did. The structure is perfect for starting from the absolute bottom of the fitness scale. From the beginning I knew I was going to be able to accomplish my goal of being able to exercise regularly again. I am now up to week 9 and am feeling wonderful! I've even started getting up an hour earlier so I can exercise before going to work! The workout is very low impact but effective. Jeanette's bubbly approach is energizing and entertaining, and there is a special section for learning the steps with each new week, which can be very helpful if you are unfamiliar with aerobic choreography. I admit that I do the workout 5 times/week rather than the recommended 3, but I am actively working at losing weight. By the way, in case you're thinking ""oh, she must be much younger than me"" or ""she must not have arthritis"", I am 62 years old, weigh 310 lbs. and not only still have chronic back problems but have had both knees replaced as well! I'm telling you - you can do this routine and end up feeling wonderful!",1378425600,37,1480,4.385454545454546
4962541,5,B0066EQ0Y4,"What a great DVD! Gives you the stretches you need and gets you moving! I really like how the workouts grow every week, helping to build up your strength and stamina.",1374019200,4,166,4.387096774193548
4962542,1,B0066EQ0Y4,"I bought this--ran it once and realized it was not going to work for me.  I had my doctor review it just as the DVD suggested.  He told me there were movements that would be difficult for me because of the arthritis in my knees.

I wrote to the company that I needed to return it and that it was under the advice of my doctor.  Guess what?  They did let me return it BUT:

3.98 for return ship fee
9.98 for restock fee

that left 5.98 of the 19.99 I paid returned to my card--I basically paid 14.00 to have nothing but air in my hand.

If this company knows you should review with your doctor first and then under medical advise it is returned they SHOULD NOT make you pay a restock fee!

BUYER BEWARE!",1374019200,24,702,4.065693430656935
4962543,2,B0066EQ0Y4,"Again, I think this should be named something other than a work out.  it is a series of movements where you don't break a sweat.  Even Jeanette DePatie commented that she did not lose any weight doing these exercises.  Somehow I think that should be stated so people don't waste their $$.",1366243200,9,288,4.5
4962544,2,B0066EQ0Y4,"She gets points for effort, enthusiasm, and embracing ""fitness at any size."" The workout, however, was just no good. Kim Lyons has much better options for people who are just getting started after years of not exercising.",1360713600,7,221,5.0
4962545,5,B0066EQ0Y4,"Working out has always been my least favorite thing to do.  I always see those fitness experts and know that I am not anywhere near where they are and I can't relate to them and I become overwhelmed with the idea of they coaching me even through a DVD.  When I came across this book and DVD I decided to try it and I've been very pleasantly surprised.  She get the other half of America, the ones that everyone has forgotten about or only create products that are not designed for people who have a chronic illness over are over 100 lbs overweight.  I've gained muscle and excitement to have a work out routine that I can do.  It's a start and that is all that I needed.  Thank you, Jeanette DePatie.

8494099,1,B0066EQ0Y4,"I bought this for my morbidly obese mother.  I got the idea from the product description that it was designed for people who are obese, who might suffer from painful conditions, and who needed a slower and gentler workout.  I liked the idea that it started out with a few minute workout and progressed from there, thinking it would be good for unmotivated people like my mom.

When I checked out the workout, I was utterly horrified.  One thing a person has to consider when buying exercise equipment or doing a workout is how it will affect your joints.  This is something that is often overlooked, even by the ""experts"".  An exercise program will do you no good if it causes you in the future to need a knee replacement.  I've rarely come across a workout that is totally safe.  I will consider them a good workout if it is only a few offending moves.  In that case, I just do something else when the move comes up.  However, this video showed nothing but damaging moves...particularly when you consider the audience it is geared for.

People who are overweight have to be especially careful.  You will have more weight working on the joint, and it is possible that your body may not have proper alignment to begin with if your weight is causing you to have lordosis.  Both can put you at risk for injuries.  This exercise program put too much stress on the hips and knees, as far as I'm concerned, and it moved too fast even at the beginning level.  I'm in better shape than my mom, and I would probably injure myself.  I wouldn't do the exercises.

If you are reading this, you may ask if I'm an expert.  I don't have any degrees or anything.  I am a person who has spent most of my life working out, and I've learned the hard way what one's body is supposed to do and what it shouldn't do.  I also observe my mom's difficulties with her weight and know what her body can't do.  I have a little knowledge I've picked up from workout books and basic medical training.",1446249600,16,1970,4.401662049861496
8494100,4,B0066EQ0Y4,"It seems like the format for the use of it could be better.  I could also do with out the impersonations .  Janette's own voice is just fine.  I know it is for a giggle,  we who are doing these vids are not too amused in the action of things. Gotta keep the remote close at hand to be able to forward it past cool down as the next week comes up.  Even after the picky things, it is a great workout .  Maybe the next one will be better formatted .",1439337600,4,446,3.7934782608695654
