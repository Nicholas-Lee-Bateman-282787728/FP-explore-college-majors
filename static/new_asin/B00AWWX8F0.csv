5524856,4,B00AWWX8F0,"Long time fan of Amos lee and I viewed this concert when it was first  broadcast on pbs.
When I heard they made a dvd I could not wait. Especially with the added songs that were
not on the pbs broadcast. The amazon site does not specify the audio output available on
this dvd, but the artists den site and others say it is in DTS 5.1. This is not the case
with the dvd I received from Amazon and cannot imagine them making two different versions.
I guess you have to be robert plant in order to get the blu ray, dts quality dvd from the
artists den.(recent band of joy,also and excellent dvd to get)
So buyer beware on this point. Otherwise the combination of amos lee's voice
calexico backing him and a truly unique concert hall makes this a must get dvd. Just
wish it got the robert plant treatment.",1363392000,,801,4.235294117647059

The Live at Austin City Limits DVD is very good as well--one you will watch more than once! :)",1363219200,,234,4.2
5524858,5,B00AWWX8F0,"Felt like a school girl listening to this man sing.  He makes it seem so effortless.  His voice, his words - truly an awesome artist.  My daughter had been telling me about him since, in her words ""I was in the 7th grade!"" She is a freshman in college now.  Love ALL his work. Never have seen him live and this was the next best thing.",1363132800,,335,4.03030303030303
5524859,5,B00AWWX8F0,"My husband and I discovered Amos Lee in 2005 on Austin City Limits.  This extremely gifted artist brought me back to my past and into my future.  I saw him in Memphis and New Orleans. Talked to him after the N.O. Show and found him to be a gentle soul who truly is grateful for those who appreciate his lyrics and music.  This most recent work is like all his previous ones--ranging from thought provoking to soothing.  How rare.  Thank you, Ryan Anthony Massaro.  I'm thankful to you for sharing your gift.",1363046400,5,507,4.456521739130435

5524862,5,B00AWWX8F0,"In this world of chaos, it is time well spent to sit down in the privacy of my own space to watch and listen to my sweet brother Amos pour his gift out on the stage. His voice, his storytelling and guitar playing are pure comfort and joy for the soul. Backed by some of the best musicians in the industry, he effortlessly sees to it that you walk away wanting more. Artists Den is to be commended on the incredible assembling of this beautiful, soul stirring DVD.  - Charese",1363046400,,474,4.266666666666667

5524864,1,B00AWWX8F0,"Love Amos Lee music, hate DVD manufacturer.  Disc arrived and skips all over starting on about song 7, can't listen to the rest of the DVD.  Can't return, don't like seller policies either.  Avoid like the plague.",1413331200,,213,4.702702702702703
5524865,5,B00AWWX8F0,Amos is fantastic.  Period.  He engages his audience & that is noticeable during this concert.  Calexico was instrumental in the Mission Bell CD and their chemistry is very noticeable in watching this.,1412467200,,201,5.21875
5524866,5,B00AWWX8F0,Great concert. Huge fan of the backup band Calexico.,1407715200,,52,4.888888888888889

5524871,5,B00AWWX8F0,"Great DVD, Amos Lee concert is intimate and shows another side of him.  Great behind the scenes interviews in between songs and his different take on the old favourite songs is great.  Highly recommend",1389052800,,201,4.882352941176471

5524874,2,B00AWWX8F0,"The syncing of the audio and video was off making the concert less enjoyable. In fact, I probably will not watch it again.",1377043200,,122,4.3478260869565215

played this dvd a dozen times, leaving me singing, humming, tearful, smiling.",1367625600,2,189,5.551724137931035
5524878,5,B00AWWX8F0,"Amos Lee: Live from the Artists Den capture a great evening of music from a truly underrated artist. Amos Lee is vibrant and soulful, the music supports him beautifully. Add appearances by members of Calexico and it adds up to a great night. ! only wish Tucson public television's ""Live From The Artists Den"" was available in my town.",1367020800,2,334,4.677966101694915
5524879,5,B00AWWX8F0,I was not very familiar with the work of Amos Lee having just one cd of his Mission Bell.  This dvd came up in my recommendations so I thought I would give it a try. I am really glad I did as this is a great concert by a very talented singer/songwriter backed by a very talented band. It is filmed in the beautiful Fox Theatre in Tucson Arizona. Calexico and The Silver Thread Trio make guest appearances. Highly recommended.,1366329600,2,425,4.3125
5524880,5,B00AWWX8F0,"EXCELLENT!  Amos Lee is truly a brilliant singer, songwriter and performer.  He is the silent hitmaker.  It is good to see him in his third DVD release.  His music is very uplifting, powerful lyrics and very universal.  This is a must have DVD for Amos Lee fans.",1364256000,,262,4.48936170212766
5524881,3,B00AWWX8F0,"If you're a new Amos Lee fan then buy this DVD, and the Austin City Limits(Loved it!!) set too. I love all his music but if you are a regular listener to A.L. then there isn't much new here that you won't get elsewhere in his albums.

I admit I've probably ruined myself listening to every one of the Amos lee albums until they're ingrained into my brain. That said I was excited to think that there was something new or changed up that I'd enjoy on this DVD. To be honest the 1st half seems only slightly different than the original cuts which are found on his albums. In the middle of the DVD I was rather shocked at the awkward beach boy version of one of my favorites. OMG what was that.

The 2nd half had two songs that were new to me which was good, and the interview segments were also somewhat interesting especially to see him speak openly. Amos is a very seasoned guy who could share some great insight from his experience but who in the world came up with the terrible questions?? The mumbling questioner was repetitive and seemed poorly prepared. The interviews in the extras were almost unbearable in duration with the moderator killing me. Take the moderator and the Artist Dens ads throughout the DVD and boot them both.

Over all I'd objectively give this effort 3 stars mostly because the video is poorly produced, crammed with screen ads for Artists Den and the interviewer was horrible. I'm a little testy because I'm starving for fresh material from the new master of this bluesy ballad genre but please, please leave the beach boys slant to someone else.",1363824000,3,1575,4.519298245614035
5524882,5,B00AWWX8F0,"I've been a fan of Amos Lee for a few years now and am constantly impressed by his musicality!
I was totally taken in with ""Low Down Life"" (track 11) which is not on any of his albums. Hopefully it's the future Amos Lee we experience here, it bringing a rougher edge to his music. It suits his style very well! I am looking forward to following this rising star on his journey to world wide recognition.
His colaboration with Calexico is also a bonus to me!",1363478400,,457,4.264367816091954

8558650,5,B00AWWX8F0,"For music lovers of all shapes and colors and tastes out there, this dvd is a visual and aural feast to consume.  It's like being there.  Amos Lee, and his very talented band, do not disappoint in this concert of a show they performed at the Newly Renovated Fox Theatre in Tucson, Arizona.  The ""Artists Den"" has surpassed itself in producing this dvd of an Amos Lee and Band concert,. Besides being one of the finest songwriters out there today, Amos Lee's sultry yet powerful vocals are delightfully accompanied by a multi-talented band.  The Fox Theatre renovated from the original built in either the 20's or 30's creates an ambiance unsurpassed in recorded performances.  You won't regret buying this, and for the price of a dvd, you can watch an amazing concert over and over again, entertain friends and family members at get togethers, and it truly is just like ""being there"" at the concert hall.",1440806400,,904,4.769230769230769
