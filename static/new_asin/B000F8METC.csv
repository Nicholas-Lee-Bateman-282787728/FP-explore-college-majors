8144971,3,B000F8METC,"These not-so-nudie nudies are early Russ Meyer and are interesting in context of his greater body work rather than as films in their own right.

""The Immoral Mr Teas"" and ""Eve and the Handyman"" are cheeky and amusing though a little tedious despite their short running time and they are tame sex-wise.

However, viewing these films today we can see how the Meyer we love evolved as one of the most interesting filmmakers of the 1960s. These films are virtually silent. They rely on narration and sight gags. While a little corny, the narration is generally witty. The use of narration was to become a mainstay of Meyer's work and was at it's hilarious best in ""Beneath the Valley of the Ultra Vixens"". Not to mention his brilliant commentary on trailers for his own films.

""Mondo Topless"" used lots of shots of tape recorders to emphasise its reliance on narration - an interesting approach Russ later returned to in the underrated ""Pandora Peaks"" which really was a return to the style of ""Mr Teas"" and ""Eve"" but with more graphic nudity.

Russ's humour in his early films is primitive, but again, in the fullness of time we see how he developed his humour into something original and insightful though without taking himself too seriously.

The early films are worth watching to see the development of Russ Meyer the artist.",1281225600,2,1327,4.777292576419214
