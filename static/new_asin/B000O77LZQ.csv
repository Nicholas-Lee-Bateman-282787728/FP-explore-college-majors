2791686,4,B000O77LZQ,I'm a big fan of Hellsing and I really like the OVA.  It's so cool that they have the original cast and the animation is really good.  If you like the manga you should definately watch this.,1184284800,,190,4.108108108108108
2791687,3,B000O77LZQ,"Though I love Hellsing I found that the Limited Edition of OVA 2 is not really worth the money. The extra DVD is probably the stupidest thing ever, its just the main guy from the English voice team or whatever and than the people who do the voices of Jan and Luke. They just laugh the whole time about nothing and its extremely boring. It made me lose respect for them. The art book is great though, its something a true Hellsing fan would appreciate. So OVA 2 is great, but I would suggest getting the regular edition. Unless your a diehard fan.",1182643200,4,546,4.310679611650485
2791688,5,B000O77LZQ,"This is the second LE edition of the hellsing OVA.Although the last one was off the entire volume 1 manga this one doesn't quiet copy the entire second volume of the manga(Although they make up for it in the third episode wich extends to the beging of the fourth manga. This episode last 46 minutes (43 not counting credits) and revolves around the attack on the integra's mansion by luke and jan. Packed fool of action and extra scenes not inculded in the manga this is even more bloodier than the first,but it feels like their could have been more added especially at the end wich leaves you wanting more. To anyone who loves hellsing or just those that like blood, action, and vampires this is a great buy and the limited edition version should be the choice you pick. Enjoy the bloodfiest of HELLSING.

2791699,5,B000O77LZQ,"Hellsing has to be the greatest anime of all time, but what I was even more impressed with was the service. Very good. I would buy from them again.",1281312000,,147,4.103448275862069
2791700,5,B000O77LZQ,"a big fan of Hellsing series, was very well done as always. this shipped very quickly and was in excellent condition",1270252800,,116,4.571428571428571
2791701,5,B000O77LZQ,"F*<k yeah as Jan would say. Didn't receaved any art book though even more sadly I badly wanted that Alucard bust from vol. 1,but on the bright side I got the extra disc worth it. Anyway I love Jane he's funny when he swers in every setence mainly when he says f*<k I love that word. Thanks Funimation and Kouta Hirano for giving this series a story plot.",1255996800,,354,4.220588235294118
2791702,5,B000O77LZQ,"Almost completely true to the manga, great animation.  Stepped up quite a bit from the original series, if you are a hellsing fan you will love it and it's authenticity.  For those who are not yet hellsing fans become fans of hellsing and buy this to watch it now!",1238457600,,264,4.36734693877551
2791703,5,B000O77LZQ,"The Good Things
*Excellent video/sound quality.
*This version of ""Hellsing"" has excellent imagery and graphics.  It includes a lot of computer-generated-imagery, but none of it looks too hoaky or out-of-place.  It is definately high quality animation.
*Excellent amount of bloody action.  Contains even more violence and action than volume 1.  Still has some comedy to it.  Also starts to introduce the presence of the Millennium group.
*Storyline is great.  It is very very close to the original manga.
*Characters are splendid.  All of the main characters are still great, and Alucard shows more impressive powers than before.  The butler Walter is cool and has some background to him.  The Valentine Brothers are flipping awesome.
*Some good lines throughout.
*Funky music (although I think the music in the old ""Hellsing"" show was better).

The Bad Things
*Not for the squeamish; contains lots of bloody violence and swearing (rated TV-MA).
*A lot of stuff is packed into a single hour.  As fast and condensed as everything is, it may be seen as overly compressed with not enough exposition.

The Other Things
*If you buy the single-disc version, you get little or no special features.  The two-disc steelbook edition (although more expensive) includes a small wealth of interviews and textless credit scenes.

This second volume continues with the excellent, intense, and fast-paced story of volume 1.  It even manages to be even more exciting.  If you have seen volume 1 and enjoyed it, volume 2 is a must-have.",1224547200,3,1517,5.130612244897959
2791704,5,B000O77LZQ,"Awesome, I can't say enough great things about the series - one of the best anime series ever. Action packed, exciting, and worth every penny.",1217980800,,142,4.72
2791705,5,B000O77LZQ,"I'm not a big fan of the Valentine brothers. Not to say I dislike them, but I wasn't excited to see them. Regardless of that, this is an excellent incarnation of this part of the Hellsing story. I don't prefer Ultimate over the TV series, they really do just tell the exact same story in different ways to different extents. Watch both, they deserve it. The Valentine brothers mark where the action in Hellsing kicks off. This episode is well animated, full of cool fights and black humor, and excellently acted, with competent music. The extras here are okay, nothing to go crazy about. Commentary, interviews with Luke and Jan's English voice actors, and a production art gallery. The credits here might be of some special interest to Hellsing fans. At the time of this writing, three Ultimate episodes have been released in the U.S.. While Ultimate I's credits show Montana Max, Doc, and the Captain along with Alucard's release to Level 0 during the attack on London, and Ultimate III's credits show parts of The Dawn which have, for the most part, not been written as manga yet, Ultimate II shows the funerals for Hellsing's staff, acting as part of the episode's content instead of showing snippets of things to come.",1217462400,,1223,4.773584905660377
2791706,5,B000O77LZQ,"When it comes to Hellsing it is hard for me to be unbiased. I am no fan of gore but with this series I find myself rooting for the vampire Alucard. Even in the most gruesome scenes you see him hesitate and wait until the enemy attacks him...then...I am in there with rest of them making faces and shouting yes. If you follow the Manga he's actually not a morally bad character, but that is my opinion. I love Hellsing and the original animated series deviated from the Manga most of the time, but was enjoyable. The original soundtrack was absolutely awesome and the one on the Ultimate series is OK in comparison. The Ultimate series is darker than the original, as in a darker mood, which follows the Manga. The Ultimate series is also of better quality in animation. I can't get enough of the Ultimate series and the latest delay in the Manga is driving me crazy. I would recommend purchasing the DVD set limited edition if you are a diehard fan like myself. I am so spoiled by the Japanese voice of alucard I can't even listen to the English version without giggling. The extra DVD didn't interest me as much as the artbook. If you don't care about the extras save your money, but if you like Hellsing you will love this. Just be warned, you may want to check out the Manga first to see if you can stomach it. As long as you have the back story the gore makes a lot of sense.",1188259200,,1379,4.3076923076923075
2791707,5,B000O77LZQ,"If you liked the original Hellsing, this anime will blow your socks off. They have improved on the series by leaps and bounds",1185926400,,125,4.478260869565218
2791708,5,B000O77LZQ,"This OVA is kick a**! Jan Valentine provides much of the humor and awesomeness that has come to be expected with the Hellsing series, while Luke is the more focused and ""sophisticated"" of the pair. This is the first time we get to see Alucard unleash a fraction of his power, which is great! Seras is beginning to discover what a vampire is truly capable of, and Integra shows more emotion than she did in the first OVA, which is a good change for her (expect more anger and rage from her later in the series). The animation is superb, the script is well-written and provides fans with a more by-the-manga plot (since the original series deviated from the manga right after the Valentine brothers' assault on Hellsing), and the soundtrack, while not as good as that of the original series, is starting to grow on me. I think it really fits better than the original soundtrack would have on this OVA. The bonus features are also worth a look, especially the round-table discussion with the voices of Luke and Jan and the English casting director. Very interesting interview with those three! A must-have for fans of the manga and the original series!",1184371200,,1149,4.665024630541872
8183487,4,B000O77LZQ,"The worst of the 10. but no issue with seller. no damage, no problems getting to me",1423526400,,83,3.9411764705882355
8183488,5,B000O77LZQ,"I love this Helsing ultimate series with it's kickass scenes. More action and a different styles from the old series. Don't get me wrong but I still love my old series too. Thumbs up to bought series but I love the the music on the steel book series of Helsing , awesome. The shipment and delivery where fast and the item was in great shape thanks amazon . I'll tell my friends and family to definitely shop your amazing web . Great deals and excellent product's in great condition. One in my book.",1358467200,,498,4.365591397849462

8183490,5,B000O77LZQ,"The DVD was perfect in my opinion, and the picture was FAR better than the Youtube version. EVERYTHING on this DVD was 100% KICKASS.",1332115200,,132,4.541666666666667
8183491,5,B000O77LZQ,"As much as I would love to be able to buy the original Japanese release, I have to live in the real world and except it's not going to happen.  Despite all the things people like to complain about when questioned about english re-releases like this one, I adore it.  Why?  Simple really.  It's CHEAP when compared to the original(thank you failing economy and rising echange rates)and if I don't feel like reading while watching tv, I just turn to the dubbed version(the voice actors actually do the anime justice) and voila.  Sure, you don't get all the nifty extras, but you also don't need to reconfigure your DVD player to make it playable.  The only draw back is having to wait for the newest releases to get dubbed.",1306454400,,721,4.550387596899225
8183492,5,B000O77LZQ,I'm very happy with the revamped Hellsing series. The animation is clean and the story is more fluid.,1284768000,,101,4.666666666666667
8183493,5,B000O77LZQ,"I am a hardcore Hellsing fan, and I was certainly not disappointed. I was a bit wary, since I normally have a terrible time with buying things online (just my luck I suppose!), but everything went perfectly. The animation and sound was of beautifully high quality on the DVD, and the DVD box and contents were in perfect condition. There were no issues with playing the DVDs. I was amazed at how fast it shipped, as well. This was definitely a 100% positive experience.",1284595200,,469,4.595238095238095
8183494,2,B000O77LZQ,"I really liked the first Hellsing, so when I heard about the remake I was thrilled!  But this volume doesn't show any expansion on the original series, and really just felt like a waste of time.  The bonus book of scenes from the storyboard is thick, but I was hoping for some more of the rough sketches.

Kind of a disappointment all around.  But I would recommend the original Hellsing series for anybody who likes vampire movies or anime.",1282953600,,441,4.544303797468355
8183495,1,B000O77LZQ,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Hellsing Ultimate, and am very satisfied with the quality of the disc content. That's not where my complaint lies, and I will truthfully admit my dissatisfaction is partially my fault.

However, vol. 2 is supposed to be packaged with an accompanying art book, some 200 pages of content, which is not included in this purchase through Amazon. Look around a little more before purchasing this particular version of the steel book sets, and find the one with the art book please.

Well, unless you're completely indifferent to extra packaging. If you are, then I suppose it doesn't make much of a difference.",1282867200,2,646,4.758928571428571
