Always remember cheap is not always a good thing for a prospective customer.  My total cost for dvd plus shipping was $7 plus change.  The dvd was a silent film without any attempt to restore and made useable.  It was almost impossible to see the film and the titles were as clear as mud.  I have had trouble with this manufacturer and I hesitated in placing this order:  how sorry I am that I did place it.  Avoid this brand and check reviews of other manufacturers to see if dvd is a properly prepared film.  The one to avoid has a red, white and blue logo at the base of the spine of the DVD.  BEWARE.

8502872,4,B006PTL1DA,"Norma Talmadge along with Paramount's Thomas Meighan are in my opinion the two most unknown ""superstars"" of the  silent film era from 1910 - 1930. She was one of the 3 most important and popular film actresses of this era along with Mary Pickford and Gloria Swanson. Norma never made or appeared in a truely great film - she was so popular that audiences of the era would go to see her in virtually anything she appeared in.

She tried but couldn't make the transition to sound film and retired in 1930. She died relatively young in 1957 and since her films weren't revived or in many instances preserved she was unseen and forgotten by generations of movie buffs for over 70 years. However thanks to the DVD revolution and film presevation her movies {along with those of her sister Constance} can now be seen and appreciated.

While Norma had appeared in movies since 1910 she was slow in developing her persona and this film is a key one in her career as it was made just at the time that she married producer Joseph Schenck. Under his astute handling between 1916 and 1918 she quickly graduated from a midlevel star into a superstar and remained one until the end of the silent era.

""The Social Secretary"" is one of her first films in which she is the focal point of the story which has single/ attractive Norma being repeatedly ""hit on"" in every job she gets and having to quit -  there was no EEO or legal remidies avalaible for sexual harrasment in 1916 !! She deliberately {and she really does a good job doing so !!} makes herself unattractive and gets a job that advertised for an ""unattractive social secretary"" to work for a prominent society matron and her family. Why ?, because the attractive women they hire keep leaving to get married -good help was hard to keep in 1916 !! A scandal sheet reporter {a slimey Eric von Strohiem} is stalking the family for dirt to print - not much has changed in 94 + years when it comes to trying to find scandal on celebrity's except now it is politicians, film and rock stars instead of the social elite.

Norma is saavy after all the groping situations she has prievously/successfully avoided and she sees thru a phony fortune hunter {who is in league with the reporter} to save the young daughter of her employer from a disastrous engagement, best the scandal sheet reporter and have the son of her employer fall in love with her {after seeing her curves and without her glasses and hair pulled back} with the final punchline being Norma writing a new advertisement to hire a new ""unattractive"" social secretary.

Norma underplays her scenes very effectively, the musical score is good and the negatives quality ranges from fair to good. This is a nice little film with equal doses of drama,humor and is unpretencious yet entertaining. I liked this movie and for the silent film and Norma Talmadge enthusiast - I give the film 4 stars.",1348790400,4,2890,4.6
