2069501,5,B00029HJP8,Watched this with my son because he loves butterflies so much. Now he get so excited whenever we're walking in the park and he sees one! It's so cute! The documentary is very good with great images and high production quality.,1429488000,,226,4.536585365853658

2069503,3,B00029HJP8,"We used this documentary for teaching our kids about the butterfly's life cycle. This video was good enough for the information we were trying to learn. We learned that out of 150 eggs laid by a female butterfly only 12 make it to become a butterfly in the end. It did mention evolution, which we do not believe in, but we skipped only about a minute of the video because of that. It was a lower quality film, but still was good for an educational video. It had some dry moments as most of these types of videos have, that is why I did not give it a higher rating.",1400025600,,564,4.136363636363637
2069504,5,B00029HJP8,"This was very educational to watch, learned so much.  My granddaughter is studying butterflies in school and has been in love with learning everything she can about butterflies.  She told me about things she learned in school and I asked her several questions as well.  We both had additional questions which we had no answers for.  So on the internet we went to search out butterfly information.  We came across this story of the butterfly and downloaded the video.  It had our attention the whole way through, it was great and answered all our questions.  Learned so much.  Great story!",1394409600,2,588,4.81

This is the only documentary I found in amazon video that keeps his interest

2069506,3,B00029HJP8,"The video begins by telling about the evolution of the butterfly from a certain type of worm.  Speaks about the ""millions of years"" it took for evolution from beginning to human stage.  If you are opposed to these beliefs this will matter greatly to you.  Since I was unaware I had to stop the video and explain to my children.  Beyond that the video is interesting and factual.  My family did enjoy it.  Only gave three stars due to the evolution and millions of years old earth since we do not believe these concepts.  Overall good video to explain the life cycle of a butterfly if you fast forward through the very beginning.",1379635200,,628,4.504424778761062

2069509,4,B00029HJP8,"This video tells about the life cycle of a butterfly.  It is simple and short enough for children as young as six to enjoy, and fascinating enough for all ages.  There are some mating scenes that may require discretion, but they are by no means vulgar.  It just depends on the audience.  I will use this again.",1173312000,9,310,4.385964912280702

8024256,4,B00029HJP8,"This has a lot of lovely time lapse photography.  I watched it with my 5 yr old and it gave a very detailed description of the life cycle of butterflies, their general habits, details on a few specific butterflies (some migrate, some die in the winter or overwinter as pupae).  Quite a few details I didn't even remember.  It was fun to watch together.",1441584000,,352,4.46875
