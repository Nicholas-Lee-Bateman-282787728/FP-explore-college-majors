5676812,5,B00BUWD7OI,Raised my daughter on this and she loved it.  Now I got this for my son and he loves it too.,1392768000,,92,3.380952380952381
5676813,5,B00BUWD7OI,"My little guys enjoy BabyFirst tv.  These are nice videos of their shows and worked very well for a 2 day car trip.  The Art and Music is our least favorite because we enjoy the music shows more than the art and this video is heavier on the art shows from the tv channel.  The Color Crew video alone was worth this purchase; it is a relatively new show on BabyFirst and both my guys love it. Our oldest tells his own Color Crew stories! The video self-repeats which took me about three hours on day 1 to figure out because the boys were loving it.  The Sweet Dreams video is the same as the overnight shows and Shushybye is several episodes and songs from that show.

If you enjoy BabyFirst TV--these are great.  If you are looking for education-oriented videos for little ones, this set is a great choice.  I recommend these even more after learning that BabyFirst is about to include advertising on their station.  This will be a way to get those shows without advertising!",1381795200,,975,4.438202247191011
5676814,4,B00BUWD7OI,"Great DVDs, just wish they contained more shows from the Babyfirsttv channel.  My daughter loves the tic toc mice and babymaze and a few others that aren't in the DVDs. Made me sad!",1428537600,,181,4.484848484848484
5676815,4,B00BUWD7OI,"My son loves baby first, just wish I knew what episodes were on it before I bought it because he only likes a few of them. It said art and music so I was hoping it would have notekins but it doesn't. It has color crew, Bonnie bear (which he likes), shushybye, sandman, arty party, drawing lessons and the nighttime dvd.",1428364800,6,319,4.245901639344262
5676816,5,B00BUWD7OI,My 10 month old baby girl loves these dvd's!  I initially bought them for bedtime because as soon as it came on she would begin to calm and settle down and fall asleep a little ways into the dvd.  Now that she is a few months older I find her very attentive to them.  They still do the trick at bedtime except she will only fall asleep after I turn it off.,1427760000,,356,3.9166666666666665

5676822,5,B00BUWD7OI,"My children love these shows! A great way to keep my kids entertained for hours, and helping them learn! My 2 year old absolutely loved Color Crew, and my newborn can enjoy the sights and music of the lullabies disk! Great compilation!",1407628800,,235,4.619047619047619
5676823,5,B00BUWD7OI,"For the price of this set compared to the peace and quite you will get from your kids falling asleep quickly this can't be beat.  All of the DVDs are good, but in particular the Soothing Sights and Sounds disc is the best.  Pop it in and the kids are out in no time.  I have found myself dozing off to it too, it is almost hypnotizing.  This is also a great gift for new parents that will thank you for years.  Baby First TV is the best.",1398556800,3,437,3.9204545454545454
8574334,5,B00BUWD7OI,Great set of video. My 8 month old loves the lullaby video as she is drifting off to sleep. Another great thing is this video plays over and over once it has started. It's on a repeat play. Love!,1484352000,,195,4.0256410256410255

8574338,5,B00BUWD7OI,"Having a child who hates being in the car, these DVDs have been a life saver. My child loves the Baby First Channel, but it's been so hard to find a DVD compilation set that we can use in our car. Not only does it actually have 4 DVDs of 4 different programs, it's well over 2 hours of programming on each DVD. These DVDs have come in handy and I will be on the lookout for more sets as they are at a great price!",1456876800,3,413,3.813953488372093
