7958781,4,B0000639I6,"In Volume 17 of the ""Rurouni Kenshin: Holy War,"" Himura Kenshin, the former Hitokiri Battousai is reduced to a minor character, not only because he has been blinded by Shougo's Rai Ryu Sen, but also because Sanosuke is the key figure in this particular story arc. Episodes 71-74 are part of the ""Tales of the Meiji"" period of the series and contiunes the saga of the persecuted Christians and the efforts of Shougo Amakusa, who believes himself to be a god and that his destiny is to claim vengeance for the dead by commanding an army of the faithful and fighting with the Hiten Mitsurugi style. Meanwhile, Sanosuke is falling for Shougo's sister, the devoute Magdaria.
The four episode included are Episode 71 ""The Conspiracy of Kaiou: Shougo Caught in a Trap,"" Episode 72 ""Days of Remorse: The Sad Past of Shougo and Sayo,"" Episode 73 ""The Sneering Demon: Shouzo and Karyu Sacattered in the Explosive Flames, and Episode 74 ""Sanouske's Tears: An Enternal Farewell Befalls the Two."" I thought that Volume 17 ""The Holy War"" would end the saga, but we still have the big fight between Shouzo and Kenshin to go. Shouzo is turned into a slightly more sympathetic figure as we learn the story of what happened to his parents and discover that Kaiou has been manipulating Shogo to further his own agenda of ruling Japan. But, of course, for fans of this anime it is the developing relationship between Sanosuke and Magdalia that is the most compelling. She is such a pure soul that she gets through his gruff exterior; but then she ends up changing more than him, which is not only a violation of our expectations but rather strange given her religious beliefs.
If you have ever seen a Western version of Japan, such as the mini-series ""Shogun"" or the recent film ""The Last Samurai,"" the episodes in this story arc represent the flips side as we get to see a Japanese perspective on Christianity. Of course I cannot vouch for either the historical accuracy or the cultural valditiy of these views, but it is certainly an interesting story line. Granted, this story line does not have the epic arc of the Kyoto storyline, but trying to do something that big again this soon was not the way to go. My main complaint is that when Magdalia's beliefs suddenly change it really undoes a lot of the pathos of her character.",1077580800,,2311,4.680589680589681
7958782,5,B0000639I6,"I like the Shimbara Arc a lot, very interesting.  Well in this tape, Shougo is still determined to ""purify Japan"", but what is he willing to risk?  Could there be someone plotting against him?  And what happened in his past that has made him into the man he is now?
With Kenshin's eye-sight gone, he has to relay on his other senses, but will that be enough to protect the innocent?  This is a very good arc, the endings ALWAYS leave you hanging.  Also a very sweet, yet sad moment between Sanosuke and Magnolia is on this tape.  A lot of action going on in these episodes, don't miss them!!",1054857600,,591,4.327272727272727
