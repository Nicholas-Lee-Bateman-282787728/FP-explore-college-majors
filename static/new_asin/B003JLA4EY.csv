8398205,2,B003JLA4EY,"There is nothing like a good faith based horror movie. To the great movies such as ""The Omen,"" ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Sentinel"" we add ""The Familiar."" Just kidding.

Sam (Bryan Massey) is a suicidal whiskey drinking gunsmith whose wife (Stephanie Young) recently died. Charlie (Jeff West) the town cop is his childhood friend. They share a dark secret other than both going to the ""John Candy School for Bad Acting."" As Sam drinks his life away in Kentucky whiskey, which starts out cloudy in the film, but clears up at the end, he is visited by his estranged sister-in-law, Lolita...no wait Laura (Laura Spencer) because Lolita would be too obvious.

Laura, our red headed hot nymph, is a bit of a spiritual flake, which makes her susceptible to demonic possession, just like dabbling in the occult as a child. The film description gives too much away.

Rallo is the name of the demon. It is also the name of a hockey player. There is a hockey player by the name of Satan. Could there be a connection?

If you are really into the faith based stuff, go ahead, it has a happy Jesus filled ending.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Laura acting sexy in a bra.",1352073600,,1172,4.588516746411483
8398206,5,B003JLA4EY,"""The Familiar"" tells the story of a former preacher named Sam who is struggling to cope with the death of his wife, and who is emotionally and spiritually manipulated by his estranged and attractive sister-in-law named Laura.  To get help with her manipulation, Laura opens herself up to possession by a demon named Rallo.  I won't tell you why Laura is using the demon to manipulate Sam because I don't want to give too much away.  I will tell you that there are almost no creepy scenes during the first hour of the movie.  Instead, the story focuses on the development of the two main characters.  This actually works quite well and leads to an ending that is surprisingly emotional.  The acting of the secondary characters is not always of the highest caliber, but there is nothing so poorly performed that it distracts from the story.  Laura Spencer's portrayal of the estranged sister-in-law is spectacular!  Her presence on screen is completely captivating!  I would recommend this movie based on her performance alone.  ""The Familiar"" leaves no doubt about holding to a Christian point-of-view, which may turn some people off.  At the same time, however, some Christians may be turned off by the movie's dark (and at times sensual) themes.  Everyone else will be treated to an entertaining tale that is sometimes very creepy (but not necessarily scary) and at other times quite moving.",1316995200,3,1392,4.927038626609442
