386946,5,6301967569,"Greer Garson stars as the real-life heroine Edna Gladney, who helped thousands of foundling children find loving and respectable homes.
After the suicide of her beloved foster sister Charlotte (Marsha Hunt), Edna learns that she killed herself because she discovered that she was a ""nameless child"".
Soon after, Edna marries her husband (Walter Pidgeon) and has a darling son-only for him to die very young. Edna decides to help other children the way she could never have helped Charlotte, and champions the cause of the foundlings.
Beautifully filmed in Technicolor, this charming turn-of-the-century epic is a fine entertainment, one you will not soon forget.",978912000,24,662,5.375
386947,5,6301967569,"This is a delightful movie about Edna Gladney, a real-life hero who made a difference through persistence and self-sacrifice, placing children in adoptive homes, establishing orphanages, and hounding politicians. The world could use a few more Edna Gladneys, especially now that the value of human life is at a low ebb. She coined a phrase which I shall never forget: ""There are no illegitimate children, only illegitimate parents.""

Beautifully filmed in Technicolor, this archtypical weeper from the forties is a glossy yet poignant venture in the heart of a  noble woman. Based upon the true story of one Edna Gladney, the woman who  began the Texas Children's Home and Aid Society of Fort Worth. In a  sensational scene, Garson makes an impassioned plea towards the Texas  Senate and you'll feel like cheering when it's over!

387022,5,6301967569,"This is a great movie. When I first started watching the movie, I did not realize that it was semi-historical. I won't call it a historical movie, because other reviewers have called it ""loosely historical"" or similar denigrations, but in spite of this looseness, this is a good film.

Unfortunately, it is true that people used to be tremendously biased against illegitimate children. They didn't blame the parents, they blamed the children. When a child was brought before potential parents at the orphanage, the prospects were told about how respectable the mother was, for example.

Back in those days, the word ILLEGITIMATE was emblazoned on every piece of important identification. This caused excellent people to despair of their lives, and sometimes they thought the only escape from their life was death.

I am glad that there were people like this watching out for our brothers and sisters. We have learned, at long last, that there are no illegitimate children. At worst, we can only blame the parents, and blame the society that forced negative labels on them throughout their lives.

One of my favorite scenes was when a busybody complained about illegitimate children. The woman (our hero) points to the playground, tells her that she knows there are three out there and invites the busybody to decide which ones they are. Of course, you cannot tell by looking.

This is a wonderful movie, and it is a feel-good movie. I'm not sure I'd call it a Holiday movie, except it does have scenes of a few holidays along the way.

I will be watching it again in the years to come.",1419638400,,1585,4.830258302583026

The movie is filled with the most charming children you could ever hope to meet - unrecognizable held up as light to today's children (Ooooooohh!)  There is one memorable line that I have already found myself quoting to friends and family. It is the scene where Greer playing 'Edna Gladney' is invited to a congressional debate, where the weight of pompous, self-righteous and privilaged opinion was very firmly against the orphans of America. Edna stands up and gives a gravitational oration sealing it with 'There are no illegitimate children........only illegitimate parents!' AMEN EDNA AND I SAY AGAIN AMEN...!!!
Again the Greer and Walter; the dynamic duo, deliver in this delightful offering; these two are just so watchable, enchanting and relaxing - which is all too rare in this day-and-age where international viewership attention can only be maintained with transforming robots, rampaging dinosaurs and lazer beam spitting spaceships and of course romance (great stuff!).

387187,5,6301967569,"This is a movie based somewhat loosely on Edna Browning Kahly Gladney, who successfully lobbied the Texas Legislature to take the word ""illegitimate"" off of birth certificates.  She also wanted to ensure adopted children the same inheritance rights of other children and better living conditions for all diadvantged children in the states care.  This is a wonderful, mainly fictional movie that tells the story of a woman courageous enough to take on the state of Texas so that children could be adopted into homes that may not have wanted them if they knew they were ""creatures of shame"".

I wish more people knew the real story behind sealed adoption records so that those who want to keep them close could no longer twist Mrs. Gladney's story to suit their agenda.  In the early 20th century records had to be sealed so that ALL children could have the possibility of being accepted into good, loving homes and have the same rights as other children.

Adoption records were sealed to protect children then and now if an adult adoptee wants their records they should be able to get them, unless the birth parent(s) have asked that they not be opened.  Over the last eight decades medical knowledge has improved dramatically and letting adoptees have their records could potentially save their life (I speak from experience, not mine but a very special person that might be alive if they had been able to get their records before they were terminally ill.  They had asked for them more than 10 years before they were diagnosed and was denied, more than once.  What is so astonishing is that once they were diagnosed as terminal, they could get the records that were denied.  Too little, too late, to save them; it's just wrong (IMHHO)).  In keeping records sealed, states are potentially sentencing innocent people to death because they cannot get their records to see if they or their future children are at risk for anything.

I love Greer Garson and wish they would do a Greer Garson Collection and/or a Greer Garson & Walter Pidgeon Collection.  She is one of my favorite actresses, I love all her movies.  She was great in everything she did, but I love every movie she did with Walter Pidgeon.  Unfortunately, not all of their movies are on DVD.",1244592000,47,2252,4.770618556701031

387202,5,6301967569,"Having worked for 28 years in child placement, and having created [...] in 1996, I have seen and heard of a lot of adoption history. I have heard thousands of adoption stories. All of them are touched by the experiences described for the first time in a major movie in 1941 with Blossoms in the Dust. It is a true classic!

Yes, there is a tremendous variety of adoption stories.  Some may see ""Blossoms in the Dust"" and find it's relation of some adoption experiences as unrealistic compared to the ones they had. I am certain they are right.  I am also just as certain that there are some touched by adoption that had experiences very similar to those in this classic. Adoption stores are as varied and different as is the human race. This movie hits the basics very well.  To have been this sensitive and creative in 1941 was a powerful achievement.

For adoption practice in 2009 this movie has powerful messages: Birth mothers never forget is probably the most central, and the damage done by secrets kept from the adoptee is probably the second most critical one present.

If you are touched by adoption you owe it to everyone you know to get a copy of this classic and then invite the ones closest to you to watch it with you some quiet evening at home.  Warn them that this movie is, as of 2009, 67 years old!  They need to remember that as they work to translate the related experiences. It is worth the effort.",1228867200,2,1420,4.455598455598456
387203,4,6301967569,"Mawkish.  Saccharine.  Manipulative.  This flick works.  MGM had a patent on this kind of sentimental fare and ""Blossoms in the Dust"" is no exception.  Credit director Mervyn LeRoy directing a script by Anita Loos for keeping the film palatable and grounded.  It also helps that stars Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon for make believable some of the film's more preposterous elements.

387205,3,6301967569,"Blossoms in the Dust is a true story about a woman who helps to rid the world of the shame of being an illegitimate child. Through her own tragedies such as the suicide of her adopted sister who had no last name and the death of her own baby, she triumphed to help many children in need. She made it so that women who worked and could not care for their children during the day could keep them instead of giving them up for adoption. She also ran a successful orphanage.

Greer Garson stars in this film, a plain, standard version of a good woman. There is nothing outstanding about her personality.

There are several points in this film that the acting seems forced such as during long periods of laughter and during times of play. These artificial scenes hinder the film.

This film was written by Anita Loos, a notorious scandalous film writer of the 1920s. It is surprising to see that she also did family dramas.

The big disappointment about this film is that nothing really seems to happen. If you read the back of the box, you know what is going to happen and you watch it simply come to life. However, the story is not exciting enough to really make much of an impact. This is old news. Perhaps for audiences that well knew the conditions of life for illegitimate children before this woman took a stand, it would be more powerful today.",1135987200,3,1347,4.441295546558704
387206,5,6301967569,"--of Greer Garson's many films with Walter Pidgeon.  Greer Garson was an odd sort of movie star.  For one thing she always seemed to be about 10 years older than the parts she was cast in, making me wonder if maybe she lied about her age when Louis B. Mayer first found her in the UK.  (Mayer had made one last scouting trip to Europe right before war broke out, and sailed back home not only with Greer Garson but with Hedy Lamarr in another stateroom!  Not a bad haul!)  She had to be lit carefully otherwise her long face took on the aspect of a friendly horse.  And once she was established in Hollywood, she displaced Norma Shearer as the ""queen of the MGM lot,"" effectively kicking Norma upstairs and into retirement, but basically because Mayer was tired of catering towards Shearer and he saw Garson as the ideal replacement.

In BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST we see something of the way she might really have looked, for she was born to act in Technicolor, and the compositions of the furnishings, costumes and even the interior decoration are all astonishinly lovely.  For its day, BLOSSOMS was sort of a scandalous picture.  I suppose MGM felt it could get away with a pinch of ""naughtiness"" if they had Garson to give that naughtiness the ""ladylike"" touch she was famous for.  Another of her Pidgeon pictures was actually titled, ""SCANDAL AT SCOURIE.""  In real life, she was responsible for two scandals, she married her own ""son"" (the actor who had played her son in MRS MINIVER), and also going on and on and on for the world's longest acceptance speech when she picked up the Oscar for the same film.  Her speech in BLOSSOMS to the Texas legislature is long, but watching it you can see why Americans loved her.  She represented a fantasy of England, a fantasy so broadly based that she could play a Texan (Edna Gladney), preposterous as it seems, and get away with it, just as she later got away with playing Madame Curie (!!)

The story is sentimental but we don't watch Greer Garson movies for slapstick value nor for biting social commentary, we watch them to provoke tears which she always does, simply and certainly as cutting up an onion.  She's great and this is one of her very best pictures.",1113350400,7,2207,4.5518987341772155

She founds an orphanage in Texas since she loses her pwn child. The blame and the redemption will open for her a new gate with unssupected possibilities .
The film os so overwhelmong acted that you miss even the plot is dated . When you watch in screen both acting giants as Pigdeon and Mrs. Carson, try to find an answer : Would you be able to find a couple actually which could match with that one?
A haunting film directed with broad gusto by Melvin Leroy who would give us years later The bad seed .
Fundamental film of the forties . A must in your collection.",1101254400,4,741,4.25531914893617

The acting from Greer Garson was first class and she played such a warm, generous person that it made us realise what a lovely world it would be if every one was as loving as the character she played.
The final scenes of the film was very moving especially when she woke up Tony to give him away to his new adopted parents. It must have been moving for her even though she was acting. Pat Barker who played the child Tony was also wonderful and he caused a few tears in our home, what a sweetheart!",1016064000,5,593,4.2105263157894735
