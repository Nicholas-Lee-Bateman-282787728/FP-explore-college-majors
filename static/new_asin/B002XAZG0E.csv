A man rides to meet others. They have a bank clerk to draw a map of the town, then they don't need him anymore! Elsewhere Logan prepares for a trip to town. Logan visits a saloon, then meets Goldy the owner. They reminisce about the past. Logan is broke and owes the bank $500. Can Goldy help him? Yes. Logan goes to the bank but its closed - its being robbed! The Sheriff and others shoot at the robbers, but Sam Ward gets away, wounded. Sam arrives at Logans home and talks to Susan, who bandages his arm. We learn about their history. Sam was previously married to Susan until he received a life sentence.

Logan straps on his revolver now. Susan asks Logan to not kill Sam. Sam stole Logans horse and arrives at the gangs hideout. Iras wife wants his share. The Sheriffs posse ends its pursuit. Logan suggests looking for Sam Ward where nobody would go. Susan talks about her future. Logan bursts in and captures Sam. They talk about the past. The others in the posse arrive. Wheres the money? Nate gets an answer from Susan. Logan objects. Will the posse take the stolen money for themselves? They see Apache warriors in the distance, a threat. They depart at dusk and avoid the Apache warriors.

They find a place to rest. Does Susan have a plan? Sam explains why he wants to kill Logan. But Sam escapes! Later Sam returns, so too many Apaches! They stop by rocks to defend themselves. A shot from afar hits Susan. The Apaches attack again but fail and retreat. There are casualties. There is talk about splitting the loot. Logan and Sam escape the Posse for a while. But gunshots announce their return, some are wounded or killed. Logan and Sam travel on to return home. Sam meets a young boy who gives him water. One of the Posse shoots and hits Sam, but Logan stops him. And so it ends.

This is about average for a story. The idea of a Posse being tempted to rob the stolen money is interesting, as is the idea of Sam being a former lawman. Darren McGavin played Mike Hammer in the late 1950's and Kolchak The Night Stalker in 1975 on TV.",1529280000,,2080,4.380829015544041

The image quality of this release is absolutely FABULOUS!  As good as I have ever seen.  Watching it brought me back to when I saw it in the theatre back in the 60s.  The only negative thing I can comment on is the cover art.  This is an Audie Murphy western, as good as they get, so why does the cover show only the bad guys?",1281225600,4,663,5.926315789473684
