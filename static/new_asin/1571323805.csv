7797367,4,1571323805,"Toddlers/kids normally grab things & like to keep them for themselves.  When they see something interesting being held by others, they insist to have it as well.  Before you know it, one kid cries then the other, then you have a whole room of wailing children.
This is where the importance of sharing comes in. As an adult, sometimes it is difficult to impress in their young minds the value of sharing & selflessness.  Especially if the kid is a lone-daughter or son, there is a tendency that he/she is used to getting his/her own way at home.
The simple dramatization of BJ & Baby Bop's feud as to who should keep the box seems like a comprehensible story for a young mind.  However, more of these situations should have been included in the story than Barney & the kids going around the world looking for Stella, the owner of the suitcase.  The ""sharing lesson"" here then became only a sideline story to a larger picture of travelling & seeing other wonderful places --- which I think children at 2 or 3 may not even appreciate at all.",1002067200,7,1038,4.5
7797368,4,1571323805,"This is my first Barney experience, and although my daughter is thrilled with ""Bargush"" and asks to see the video about 100 times a day, my husband and I are easily annoyed by it.  We're able to accept the fact that she learns sharing from it and loves the dancing (and at 20 months, she's dancing along with them as well as she can), but I was disappointed with what seemed like the results of some lazy pre-filming research and/or planning. The producers had an excellent opportunity to show some true cultural hughlights of each country, but I wonder if they'd ever even been to France and were just basing their French scene on what they imagined France might be like. (I've never been to Canada or Mexico, so I can't say for sure how well those countries were represented.) Also, the French friend ""Maurice"" has a Spanish accent, and at the end of the film, I checked the credits, and he has a Hispanic name.  Does this mean that any old accent will do?  Also all the adults have to leave the children because they are so important, they have to be somewhere else.  Stella does it twice in the same episode, saying, ""Oh my! Look at the time! I'm supposed to be in France (or Africa) in five minutes!""  The Mexican woman, in the middle of a fiesta, suddenly sees a clock and shouts, ""Oh no! Look at the time!  I must be going!"" but she doesn't explain why.  Does she turn into a pinata at midnight?  Monty the Mountie says he has to go back to work.  Maurice says, ""I must go now.""  Would it really have been so difficult for the producers to make the *children* the important ones who have to run?  After all, they're the ones on the mission to find Stella to return her suitcase--they could easily be the ones to bid the goodbyes, explaining they had to find Stella.  Or does there have to be a parting excuse at all?  I'm concerned about the message being related to children: that adults lead such important, busy lives, that they have limited time with children, and then ""must"" leave them in a hurry.
My daughter can continue to watch Barney for another year perhaps, but when I feel like she has the comprehension level to detect the subtleties I mentioned above, I'll put the video aside for the next baby.",971395200,7,2218,4.433497536945813
