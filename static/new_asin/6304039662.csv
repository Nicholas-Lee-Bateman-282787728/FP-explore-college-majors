(Unfortunately, the original title--La vie est belle--has been eclipsed by the later Roberto Begnini movie of the same name--in French.)

8324348,4,6304039662,"This is a very amusing and interesting movie about an unusually gifted peasant who becomes a famous musician in Kinshasa (then Zare). It is a romantic and very lively comedy and a fascinating glimpse at life in a large african city. The music is excellent,the story funny and the local actors amazing. Now that the country is ravaged by a horrible civil war (the ""first african world war""), it is even more interesting (if sad) to watch.",979948800,6,437,4.688311688311688
