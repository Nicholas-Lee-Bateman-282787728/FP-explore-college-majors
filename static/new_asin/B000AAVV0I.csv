8077472,5,B000AAVV0I,"Those were the good times...traveling in Europe and learning about all the different types of beer. This TV show represented Michael Jackson's love for both and his brilliant way to include you, the viewer, in the fun. For those who didn't tape the show back then (those VHS tapes are getting old now!) this is the TV series. And fear not: [...] announced that a new documentary is planned for the latter part of 2010!",1275696000,,418,4.586666666666667
8077473,5,B000AAVV0I,"This is one of those series where time goes by too quickly.  Enjoyable stories, good fun, interesting information and then , too soon, done with tape one, onto tape two.  Repeat and soon the series is done.  You don't have to be a beer fanatic to enjoy the show; Michael is a treat to listen to and he brings out the best in his guests.  It's a shame that the series is too short and that there aren't any more to come.",1128384000,2,419,4.073170731707317
