Miss 'Ol Skelton and glad there are videos to watch again.  The makers of this DVD have done a masterful job, and the sound was developed clearer although still a little statically due to the tech they had back in the '60's.",1398816000,2,379,4.236111111111111
8284559,5,B001BSBBLC,"First, I loved seeing the wonderfully talented Red Skelton back in this fabulous christmas film. Secondly I found the colorization was done to perfection by Legend Films. Not sure why one consumer was unhappy with this, unless he or she just received a poor copy. Cannot find anything negative to write-a great one to add to your holiday film collection. Lastly, I had the pleasure of watching this one with my grandmother and it brought back happy memories for her. 5 stars!",1396137600,,475,4.804878048780488

8284561,5,B001BSBBLC,"Legend Films presents ""RED SKELTON: CHRISTMAS CLASSICS"" (1955) (68 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- Richard Bernard ""Red"" Skelton was an American comedian who was best known as a top radio and television star from 1937 to 1971 --- Skelton's show business career began in his teens as a circus clown and went on to vaudeville, Broadway, films, radio, TV, night clubs and casinos, while pursuing another career as a painter.

In 1951, NBC beckoned Skelton to bring his radio show to television --- His characters worked even better on screen than on radio --- Television also provoked him to create his second best-remembered character, ""Freddie the Freeloader,"" a traditional tramp whose appearance suggested the elder brother of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus clown Emmett Kelly --- Announcer/voice actor Art Gilmore, who voiced numerous movie trailers in Hollywood in the 1940s and '50s, became the announcer on the show, with David Rose and his orchestra providing the music --- A hit instrumental for Rose, called, ""Holiday for Strings,"" was used as Skelton's TV theme song.

Besides ""Freddie the Freeloader,"" Skelton's other television characters included, ""Cauliflower McPugg,"" ""Clem Kaddiddlehopper,"" the, ""Mean Widdle Boy,"" ""Sheriff Deadeye,"" ""George Appleby,"" and ""San Fernando Red."" --- Sometimes, during the sketches, Skelton would break up or cause his guest stars to laugh, not only on the live telecasts but on the taped programs as well. Skelton's weekly sign off -- ""Good night and may God bless"" -- (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
