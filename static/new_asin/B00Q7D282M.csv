8690647,5,B00Q7D282M,"Very in-depth technical information for the self-defense applications of the basic ""blocking"" techniques of most karate systems.
Maybe a little too advanced for beginners, but for someone at the shodan level this would be a great reference source to enhance their understanding of these ""beginner"" movements.",1473552000,,308,5.717391304347826
8690648,5,B00Q7D282M,"Very well done instructional video. Unlike some instructional that go too fast for beginner students Dustin Seale takes his time.  He reviews the points used and how to activate them without getting into theory.

It is also good because Mr. Seale teaches to the camera and not to a seminar crowd while a camera is running.  This is important because seminar videos can be very hard to see details as the teacher is showing the details to the attendees, not you.  On this DVD I never had to squint or rewind to catch the details and that was a pleasure.

Finally there was a good variety of techniques shown.  Five or maybe six basics with perhaps 3-5 applications for each.  If your experienced in Kyusho there is going to be a bit of review, but for someone starting this journey it is a good resource of clearly explained technique.",1449532800,,834,4.557046979865772
