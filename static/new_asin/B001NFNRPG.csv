3715996,3,B001NFNRPG,"An expedition is dispatched to a small uncharted island in order to bring exotic creatures back to a Tokyo zoo. They find a gigantic egg (about the size of a refrigerator) in a mysterious cave. A volcano erupts just in time to hatch the egg, releasing the hideous bird-lizard monster within! Our heroes whisk it back to Japan, where it's parents (two giant plucked-turkey people) soon arrive to reclaim their offspring. The total destruction of prime real estate ensues. Lots of model army equipment is eviscerated. Birdzilla jr. and parents are reunited. The end. MONSTER FROM A PREHISTORIC PLANET isn't a complete waste. After all, the gal who plays the photojournalist is a hottie! The rest is pretty much standard fare. Watch it with the kids (toddlers), they might like it...",1118448000,2,780,4.961832061068702

3716008,2,B001NFNRPG,"Really bad print of the film.  I had previously copied this film off of television, and bought this one in hopes of getting a better copy.
The one I recorded off of TV is much better than this.
Nothing against the seller, though.  He kept his end of the deal.",1442016000,,259,4.16
3716009,5,B001NFNRPG,otherwise known as GAPPA this is a great classic giant monster film and im very happy that there are other kaiju out there besides Gamera and Godzilla.,1436918400,,151,4.62962962962963

3716012,4,B001NFNRPG,"This is a review for alpha video version of this film. Good monster flick and if you read this far my opinion on it doesn't matter to you

It's in English, no subtitles or audio options
It's not widescreen
It's 2 channel audio
It's very dark and you literally can't see 20% of the film (well silhouettes or pinpoints of the torches as natives dance)
Only slightly blurry on my big screen (12 foot wall) but not unwatchable. Again I have big screen so probably bary notice on average TVs.

Luckily half the monster scenes are in lighted city scapes so you can see what's happening",1404432000,,579,4.452830188679245
3716013,1,B001NFNRPG,"This version from Alpha Video is now a DVD-R. The video quality is very poor, looks dark and the color is very ""washed out."" This movie is also included in the ""Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection"" which has a much better and vibrant video. As far as I know there is currently no DVD version that maintains the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio along with the original Japanese language. That's just a shame because the movie has a very ""campy"" feel and is enjoyable in that respect.",1398038400,,483,4.563218390804598
3716014,1,B001NFNRPG,"Don't buy this DVD.  It is an awful copy by Alpha Video.  When I ordered this I thought is was the Tokyo Shock version which the revilews of the DVD stated it was.  My bad-  I should have read the product specification and would have seen that it was an Alpha video copy.  It is dark, grainy, awful audio and barely watchable.  The good news is that Amazon sells the Tokyo Shock version called Gappa, the Triphibian Monster which is available through their dealers and not on Amazon prime.  It costs a few dollars  more but the copy should be so much better than this Alpha version.  I swallowed the $8 and ordered the Tokyo Shock version. So let my bad choice be a cautionary tale for you.  Thanks.",1359676800,2,699,4.348837209302325
3716015,1,B001NFNRPG,"This is a joke. The quality of the video and audio are so bad it is unwatchable. The wrong aspect ratio, cropped incorrectly, too dark, blocky. It looks like it was made for a tiny cell phone video and blown up.
This is a bootleg dvd,its also a DVDR not a true DVD. you cant even contact REEL CLASSIC FILMS, they give you a fake website address. Amazon should look into this. Notice there is little to no info about this dvd.",1233014400,3,425,4.195121951219512
3716016,3,B001NFNRPG,"Early in this flick, they start speaking of a place called ""Playmate Land.""  Boy, did that ever get our attention!  We regret to say, however, that Hugh Hefner cuties are not part of the story.  An intrepid team of explorers search for exotic animals to populate a new theme park.  In true King Kong fashion, they find natives on a remote island that venerate something known as ""Gappa.""  Gappa is a Godzilla-Poll Parrot hybrid.  They spit blue fire.  They have beaks, wings and a long lizard tail.  A huge egg in a spooky cave hatches a sad-faced monster.  In true B movie fashion, the explorers take the young creature back to Japan for study and exploitation.  Dad and Mom Gappa, however, take issue with this development.  The giant adult Gappas stomp across Tokyo, looking for Junior.  Fire, explosions, and mayhem ensue.

This is another in an endless line of Japanese sci-fi monster movies of the '60s that displays the peculiar charm of the genre.  The FX suffer from low budget constraints, as usual.  The volcano that spews sparks and black smoke looks as if it was found among the project rejects of a high school science fair.  The acting and dubbing are part of the chuckle-headed fun.  As long as one does not expect miracles, genre fans can enjoy the nonsense. ;-)",1142294400,2,1279,4.6891891891891895
8326734,2,B001NFNRPG,"as Elvis said,a little less conversation and a little more action,a little less bark and a little more bite",1527292800,,107,4.684210526315789
8326735,5,B001NFNRPG,"Also known as Gappa, the Triphibian Monster (whoever came up with that one deserves to be anally assaulted by a triphibian monster) is a truly sweet giant monster romp, with shades of Gorgo and Gamera, and just a dash of old style mayhem thrown in.  Borrowing from more popular monster flicks and mashing them up in a cinematic blender, it uses the innocent island natives (played by badly made-up Japanese extras) who worship a god, then the god or its egg/brood is taken from the island and then all hell breaks loose and the fun begins.  The creature effects were good for the time it was made and although they will never overtake Toho or Daiei, the Gappa adults and infant are good enough.  The story is standard monster fare and ends as predictably as most do, and alls well that ends well.  Its' runtime is better than Varan and not as long as others, and I could watch this over and over again, either to spoof it or just enjoy it as is.  Monster form a Prehistoric Planet is a must have for collectors of kaiju films.",1526774400,,1026,4.4361702127659575
8326736,4,B001NFNRPG,The best unintentional comedy ever! loved the islanders and their interaction with the Japanese crew. Where is the Rifftrax guys when need um! Great stuff.,1524268800,,155,5.24

8326738,2,B001NFNRPG,"I couldn't be sure if I liked the movie or not as half of the picture was missing. The aspect ratio was way, way off. Literally half of the picture was off screen (shaking my head). As far as Japanese monster movies go, it is pretty typical of that genre. Not the best, but not the worst either. The quality of the film was pretty low, i.e.; blurred edges on images, not sharp, sound slightly warbly, like it's under water, and in monotone, and the colors are more muted like a very old copy of the movie. In all honesty, it was like watching a poorly uploaded movie on Youtube (I'm sure you know what I mean) and that may be exactly where it came from. I give it two stars because of the poor uploading.",1520208000,,704,4.1838235294117645

8326741,2,B001NFNRPG,"Monster from a Prehistoric Planet, 1967 film

A merchant ship sails the ocean. A woman reads a book on deck. A man runs to the radio shack for a message. They show the officials of Playmate Magazine. The publisher has a plan for a resort, Playmate Land. There is a movie at night, the ship shakes as if it hit something. One man tells of a huge monster fish! But its gone. A bad dream? They see a volcanic island with a stone statue from a lost civilization. Can it be inhabited? They hear drumming. [Are they armed?] The people greet them with joy. There is dancing, the sounds are recorded. Can these people be relocated to Japan? A young boy talks about Kappa. There is an earthquake! It reveals a cave. The visitors explore it. A lake under a volcano? They find a big skeleton, then a large egg.

There is another earthquake; the egg begins to hatch. No touch! says the young boy. The natives blame the visitors for the disturbances. Inside the cave there is a strange being. They have a lizard in a cage, the scientist wants to use it for research. Back in Japan the publisher talks about the expedition. Two-legged creatures appear at night, the natives scream! A USN submarine appears offshore. The publisher plans to smuggle that lizard into Japan to create a sensation. This causes Playmate Land to fail. They will tame this animal and teach it a few tricks. The lizard is growing, how big will it grow? It gives off sparks, like a monster. That submarine is being followed. Two unidentified flying objects are seen in the airspace of Japan.

A monster lands from the sea, people scream and run! Buildings collapse when the monster walks on them! Military units are called to destroy this menace. Army trucks fire their cannons without any effect. The monsters fiery breath destroys tanks. Jet fighter planes fire their rockets to no avail! The fighters are destroyed by the monsters fiery breath. Then the monsters fly away to the sea. Everyone buys their magazine. How can these monsters be stopped? They plan to use ultra-sound at 30K to get them out of the lake so missiles can kill them. That native boy says should send the baby monster back to the parents. The ultrasound generators create noise to drive the monsters out of the lake. Rockets are launched against them! Keep firing! A tidal wave destroys housing. The monsters approach Tokyo. People watch the monsters arrive. Their baby greets them. The terror is over, the Kappa fly away to return to their island. All is well. Its all over says one man. We shouldnt be selfish. Will there be a happy future for this woman?

This is amusing for its attitudes. It is like other classic horror movies: a monster appears to threaten the people, they unite and answer the threat, and the problem goes away. The choice of a monster is funny - a big being would need a huge wingspan to fly through the air. Would it also have a long lizard tail? Not likely, its non-functional dead weight. But horror monsters are irrational. They symbolize a threat to people. The book Hollywood Horror by Mark Vieira offes explanations for the appeal of these movies, which become popular during difficult economic times.",1482278400,,3168,4.651785714285714
