And man oh man, am I glad I'm a member of this circle, if only because of this one movie! When I searched on Amazon.ca and Amazon.com, I did not find Wild Horse of Shangri-la in a format that could be viewed in North America.
This is regrettable as I find it to be an amazing film with a heartful message of courage, family and of community. Anyone who's ever sought a dream and wasn't too sure how to get there, this is inspiring indeed. Wild Horse of Shangri-la is a movie depicting a hero's journey of commitment and faith. Everything about this film strikes a true chord -- the story, the actors, the scenery, the music. It is a Chinese film with English subtitles. Most heart-lifting film I've seen in a long time! It certainly answers the question : ""What difference can one person (within a supportive community) make?""",1309564800,,1064,4.695187165775401
