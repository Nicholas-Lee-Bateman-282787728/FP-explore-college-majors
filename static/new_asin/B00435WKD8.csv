The great thing about this version is its HITS format.  If you have seen the 45 min episodes, they start at the dim beginning of the sunrise and elapse with time.  This set just shows the more active scenes with the wildlife in nature during sunrise while maintaining that tranquil feeling of the show.",1437782400,,432,4.430379746835443

8414208,5,B00435WKD8,"Not worth 100.00 for the blu-ray. When the price drops 80% I will buy.

I watched the Sunrise Earth episode Bison before Breakfast on Discovery Channel HD and it is simply one of the most beautiful and serene programs I have ever seen. The beautiful scenes (especially when it the camera pans from the left to right showing the valley in all it glory)is hypnotic. The sounds and beautiful scenery are quite simply amazing. I can't understand WHY this episode is not available in Blu-ray. There is no dickie music or narration to spoil it what you see and hear are what you would see and hear if you were actually there. This video is as relaxing as taking a Valium. When it becomes available on Blu-ray I will buy it.",1359849600,2,717,4.473282442748092
8414209,1,B00435WKD8,"I am rating this item one star primarily because the description does not include a complete list of the programs included. I do not buy products unless there is a complete description of the product. This might be a great set, I will not buy it.",1346803200,3,246,4.369565217391305
8414210,5,B00435WKD8,"Those fortunate enough to see the Sunrise Earth series videos in broadcast know they are Discovery Channel productions which are just that: Videos of sunrises in various places around the world.  If you've never seen a Sunrise video in this series before, you're in for a wonderful treat.

First, let me clear up what these videos are not.  They are not ""documentaries"" in the sense of ""show-and-tell"" movies.  There is no narration at all.  There is no music at all.  What you see and hear is what you would see and hear if you were to be on location at sunrise.  All the sights and sounds of the flora and fauna, set against the beautiful colors of the rising sun.  There is an occasional text box that appears briefly in the lower left corner of the screen, introducing each segment, or providing a few words of interest about a scene, but these are extremely few and far between.  The videos are not meant to be informative or instructive, per se.  They are meant to be experienced.  If you've ever seen documentaries or photographs of a place like, say, Yosemite National Park, and thought how wonderful it might be if you could actually be there at sunrise, taking it all in and experiencing the peace and calm of nature at that moment, then these videos are for you.  The footage is designed to produce total immersion.  It is experiential, not expository.

This particular set includes a sampling from many of the other videos in the total series.  It is divided into Western US and Eastern US settings.  For the West, as might be imagined, there is inclusion of some of the Great National Parks, like Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Sequoia, as also other areas, like the Great Plains, the Rockies, and the Grand Teton Range.  In the East, we are treated to sunrises over the Florida Everglades, some northern lakes in New England, the Gulf of Mexico, and other places.  The ones that really drew me in were the videos shot in Maine.  Before seeing these, I never knew how many stunningly beautiful lakes and mountains Maine has.  The footage is absolutely gorgeous and meditative.  Each segment has been shot from several vantage points using multiple cameras, and the scenes periodically move from one point to another, so it is not as if you have only the view from one place to enjoy.  Every segment blends into the next, maintaining a feeling of continuity in the progressing sunrise.

You won't turn to these videos to be entertained, instructed, or amused. You'll come back to them again and again when you feel like enveloping yourself in quiet space.  They are a haven from the hustle and bustle of ""normal"" life.  I cannot recommend them highly enough.",1330214400,12,2666,4.706263498920086
