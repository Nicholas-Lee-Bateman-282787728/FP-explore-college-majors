1387495,3,B000051SH3,"Columbia Pictures never produced a movie serial comparable to the best Republic cliffhangers. However, ""The Phantom"" (1943) survives as one of the studio's better efforts, thanks to Tom Tyler's memorable presence in the title role and the assured direction of B. Reeves Eason. Unlike Republic, the Columbia serials were more faithful in terms of comic-strip adaptations. ""The Phantom"" is no exception. Unfortunately, Columbia lacked the solid production values and crisp pacing of the Republic serials   further hindered by the studio's excessive 15-chapter length. Still, ""The Phantom"" makes the most of Columbia's low-budget shortcomings with its effective jungle setting and above-average cliffhanging exploits. As ""The Ghost Who Walks,"" Tyler is a terrific action hero and does not rely on a stunt double during the fight scenes. Fans of Lee Falk's comic-strip creation will not be disappointed.",1017964800,128,899,5.651851851851852

Many of these films were produced  pre-WWII, and during the war, which put serious limits on production budgets. At the same time, the public needed heroes, and, in most cases, these serials rose to the occasion.

1387542,5,B000051SH3,"""The Phantom"" is a 15-chapter 1943 Columbia serial directed by B. Reeves Eason, based on the newspaper feature by Lee Falk.  Unlike many such adaptations, this one doesn't stray too far from the original, though it has a few of the problems often seen in serials from Columbia.

The Phantom, ""The Man Who Never Dies"" or ""The Ghost Who Walks"" rules the jungle, the peace of which has recently been disrupted, and after a long absence The Phantom (Sam Flint) needs to return, calling a meeting of the tribes.  The Phantom appears, but a poisoned dart hits him so he cuts his speech short, and vanishes.  Knowing he is dying, The Phantom sends a message to his son, Geoffrey Prescott (Tom Tyler) who now has to take over.  Geoffrey and his dog Devil (Ace, the wonder dog) have been with Professor Davidson (Frank Shannon), his niece Diana Palmer (Jeanne Bates) and her fiance Byron Anderson (Guy Kingsford) on an expedition to find the lost city of the Zoloz.  So far they have found the not-so-lost city of Sai Pana, where the Professor meets Singapore Smith (Joe Devlin), with whom he compares segments of a map made of pieces of ivory.  They find one segment is still missing, and Singapore Smith entrusts his pieces to the Professor, planning to steal all of them later.  Of interest to Smith is a treasure rumored to be in the lost city.  But the local doctor, Max Bremmer (Kenneth MacDonald) works against the Professor and Smith, since he is trying to build a secret airbase at Zoloz, and is in fact responsible for the unrest in the Jungle.

Some of the facts of the plot have been incorrectly stated not only in other reviews, but on VCI's package, where Diana is identified as Professor Davidson's daughter and The Phantom as her fiance.  Dr. Bremmer is not in search of the segments of the map; he wouldn't be building an airbase at Zoloz if he didn't already know where it was, but he needs a labor force and plans to get it through control of the tribes.

We aren't really sure where this jungle is located.  The tribesmen look more South American Indian than African, except for Chief Tartar (Dick Curtis) and his men, whose fur-trimmed costumes suggest more northern climates, maybe Siberia or Mongolia.  Tartar's gorilla doesn't seem to be credited even at IMDb, though he looks exactly like Ray Corrigan in his ""Bonga"" suit.  The events in Tartar's domain are a world apart from the rest of the action, all too much like something out of a Three Stooges comedy, familiar territory to both Dick Curtis and Kenneth MacDonald.  The ""Fire Princess,"" actually a dancer hired by Bremmer named Ruby Dawn (Early Cantrell) in Chapter Nine isn't much better, though at least she is supposed to be a fake.  Fortunately this tendency only lasts a couple of chapters fairly late in the serial, and director B. Reeves Eason is a decided asset to the action sequences, which are better than usual from Columbia.  The studio backgrounds are a little lacking, especially those for a fight on a suspension bridge, and The Phantom's costume has a lot of wrinkles, though fortunately Tom Tyler looks believable in it.  It is helpful that the emphasis is on action, though Tyler does justice to his spoken lines.  Jeanne Bates' role is a little limited, only requiring rescue a couple times, but she fits into the plot fairly well.  Frank Shannon as her uncle sounds a lot like Dr. Zarkov, for some reason, though he looks enough like an old archaeologist while Kenneth MacDonald is suitably menacing without the excesses often used by Columbia's villains.  There are a number of well known serial-movie actors in secondary roles, including Stanley Price as Chief Chota, Ernie Adams, for once a good guy as Rusty Fenton, John Bagni as Moku, and a host of henchmen including George Chesebro, Edmund Cobb, Al Ferguson, I. Stanford Jolley and Kermit Maynard.  The music by Lee Zahler is appropriate, better than in many Columbia serials, if not quite up to the ""pulse-pounding"" scores used by Republic.

VCI's edition, # 8268 is on two discs, the image sharp with good gray scale.  There are a few visible splices, brief horizontal double-lines that do not affect the sound, though in Chapter Five a different kind of horizontal line is seen, a tape wrinkle scrolling in the upper half of the picture, 10:56 into the chapter for eight frames, a very minor defect.  The sound is mostly fine, low in noise, with good frequency response and low distortion by standards of films of the era.  Chapter 11 had most of the soundtrack missing, and had to be restored with music from other chapters and actors speaking the lines, mostly of characters in Tartar's domain.  While not too disruptive, the substitution is especially noticed in the introduction, where the voice used is not a good match for narrator Knox Manning.  The Special Features include ""Bios"" of Tom Tyler, Jeanne Bates, Kenneth MacDonald and B. Reeves Eason.  There is a ""comic art"" feature with 25 covers of comic books that included The Phantom, and a ""photo gallery"" with sixteen pictures, plus one daily comic strip that unfortunately is not sharp enough to read.  And there is commentary, by Dick Tracy writer Max Allan Collins, presented on an alternate audio track during the first chapter, probably best heard after watching the chapter.

This is a good serial with a plot that doesn't seem illogical when watched one chapter at a time, and VCI's excellent print makes it one of the better relases of its kind.",1310428800,8,5469,4.766702014846236
1387543,4,B000051SH3,"I think anyone who does not already have a familiarity with this serial, should go into it with grounded expectations and not consider modern production standards not applicable to that period. Natives are stereotyped and often played by Caucasian actors (consider the era). The dialogue is your standard serial run of the mill - Sometimes stilted, but always fun. The Phantom is played by actor Tom Tyler who was best known for his role in the Captain Marvel serial. Monster fans know him best as ""Kharis"" in the 1940 classic ""The Mummy's Hand"". Unlike previous hero serials, Tom Tyler does have a convincing physique for the role and wears a costume that is pretty faithful to the basic look of our hero. The fight scenes are fun to watch and the storyline is far more engaging than most serials because they keep the story within the confines of the jungle which offers a variety of cliffhanger twists. Overall a very satisfying story that tries not to stray far from the source material. As serials go, I consider this one of the better efforts of that period. Ironic since it comes from Republic Pictures, who seldom respected the license they were using. But if your a Phantom fan looking for a good time, this should hit the mark nicely.",1302048000,3,1244,4.7110091743119265

1387557,5,B000051SH3,"The Phantom's creater,the late Lee Falk,never had anything good to say about this serial adaptation of his classic comic strip. But for the life of me I can't see why he didn't care for it. This serial is very faithful to the comic strip. Oh to be sure,there are deviations. But what Hollywood comic book adaptation has ever been completely faithful to the source. This movie is great fun. You've got lost cities in the jungle,quicksand pits,collapsing bridges,rock slides,wild animals(including the obligatory man in a gorilla suit),hostile natives and all the other cliches of the ""jungle thriller"" genre. Tom Tyler wasn't the greatest actor in the world,but he did have the physical presence to play a super hero. As he had already proved when he portrayed Captain Marvel a few years earlier. Kenneth MacDonald is great as the film's villian and Jeanne Bates makes for a lovely damsel in distress. My biggest problem with this film is that the Phantom is very rarely referred to as the ""ghost who walks"".Instead he is called by his other nickname the ""man who can never die"".Probally because some Hollywood suit decided that the heroic Phantom should not be referred to as a ghost. Just too spooky for the Saturday matinee crowd. This DVD even has a great extra. A first chapter commentary by novlist and comic book writer Max Allan Collins.

1387560,4,B000051SH3,"Made in 1943, The Phantom was a classic Columbia Pictures cliffhanger serial that starred Tom Tyler in the leading role. In this serial, Geoffrey Prescott takes over the mantle of The Phantom from his dying father, and must thwart Dr. Max Bremmer's plans to find the lost city of Zoloz, where the doctor intends to build a hidden airbase. To find Zoloz, the Phantom and Bremmer are both searching for pieces of a map that will lead them to the secret city, which is hidden deep in the jungle. Like most serials of the day, The Phantom has to make his way through many twists and turns in the story before saving the day in the end. Directed by B. Reeves Eason, this is one of the better Columbia Pictures Serials. As you've read in other reviews, Columbia wasn't well known as a great movie serial maker like Republic Pictures was. Nonetheless, it is one of my favorites from back in the day. The serial also features Jeanne Bates as Diana Palmer, and Ace the Wonder Dog as the Phantom's trusty German shepherd Devil. Like most serials of the day, it lasts over 15 chapters. It's well worth getting and watching before checking out the 1996 movie starring Billy Zane(which, in my opinion, is just as great).

1387562,4,B000051SH3,"Columbia Pictures was infamous for making infamously bad serials.  However, through some inexplicable fluke, they made a really great serial in 1943.  It was called `The Phantom.'  Here are some of the things that make this serial so good:
1. Tom Tyler in the title role.  He projected a strong and quietly heroic screen presence, and was athletic enough to look good in the Phantom suit.  He is believable in the fight scenes.  Superhero suits look good in comic strips, but usually on the screen they look completely stupid.  Tom Tyler, a former champion weight lifter, could pull it off.  He was also a decent actor.  Totally serious, but never camp or inadvertently goofy.  I rate him as being almost as good as Buster Crabbe, as far as serial heroes go.  Definitely head and shoulders above Kirk Alyn or either of the poor guys that played Batman in the serials.
2. Good fight scenes.
3. Ace the Wonder Dog, playing `Devil,' the Phantom's dog (in the comic strip, Devil was a wolf, but trained wolves were more expensive).  All the great heroes each have certain gimmicks, trademarks, special weapons, etc.  Such is Devil for the Phantom, and the idea of the hero being aided in a fight by a big dog is a cool idea.  Devil definitely makes the fight scenes more interesting and believable here.
4. Good cliff hangers.
5. Staying reasonably faithful to the original source material.  Although taking some serious liberties regarding the comic strip from whence it was inspired, this serial still retains the spirit and appeal of the Lee Falk's creations.  Rightly so, the Phantom is a cool character, and should be treated with a little respect.

And now, a short commentary regarding racial stereotypes: in my mind, it has always been problematic that in the comics, the Phantom is an unelected pale-skinned person holding a high degree of authority for a large group of darker-skinned persons.  To be fair, the Phantom was created in the 1930's, when there was a lot of overt racism in the U.S., when Lee Falk and most of his readers wouldn't have had anyone to point out this inequity.  And to be fair, Lee Falk's representation of African tribes, though entirely fanciful, was much less derogatory than that of Edgar (`Tarzan') Rice Burroughs or of any mainstream Hollywood movie.

Which brings us back to this serial.  While all the action takes place in the jungle, there are no positive indications as to whether this jungle is in Africa, South America, Asia, the Canary Islands, or southern Albania.  Nor is there any coherent racial representation regarding the natives of this imaginary region.  Many were played by Caucasian actors, some by Native Americans (an unbilled Jay Silverheels played a small role), as well as actors of other ethnicities.  Overall, their skin color is not much, if any, darker than the Phantom's.  Also, the characterization of the natives in this serial, while often fitting an unflattering stereotype, is much less offensive than you see in Tarzan and Jungle Jim films of the same era.

All in all, I would recommend this for serial fans, film buffs, and admirers of the the Phantom.",1202342400,3,3127,4.8528301886792455

I was truly disgusted to hear him say that the wealth of the Zoloz tribes belongs to his sponsor University! What nonsense! Even Phantom was no better. He realized that the jewels in his skull cave are the treasures of the Zoloz, but did not consider returning them to the tribes!

1387567,5,B000051SH3,"This is based on Lee Falk's popular comic strip, ""The Phantom,"" who was known as ""The Ghost Who Walks,"" in purple tights yet.  Columbia usually had independent producers do its serials but this one was actually produced by Columbia, taking advantage of the studio's extensive facilities.  In a world where the best serials were made by Republic, Columbia was second-best.  This certainly one of their very best.

Tom Tyler (""Adventures of Captain Marvel"") is an excellent Phantom, and B. Reeves ""Breezy"" Eason, formerly with Republic, did a great job of directing.  Frank Shannon must have matured as an actor, because he's much better here than in the Flash Gordon series.  Jeanne Bates signed with Columbia in 1942, and was probably best known to aficionados of horror flicks.  She had a long movie career, mostly in smaller parts.

One of the best features of this DVD is the first-chapter narration of Max Allen Collins, the writer who took over the Dick Tracy comic strip when Chester Gould retired.  He places ""The Phantom"" in historical context and really sets the scene to help you enjoy the movie.  Be sure to see it before going beyond Chapter One.",1136678400,15,1158,4.892307692307693
1387568,4,B000051SH3,"-This is one of the better serials I have collected. I really dig the whole Phantom deal and they did it justice with this series. I watched it from begining to end over a period of 2 days.

-It is a two disc collection of all 15 weekly episodes that explore a couple different cross story lines wrapped around one main story. It is in BLACK&WHITE but it is easy to imagine the scenes in color. The only reason I gave it 4 as opposed to 5 stars, and this is being real picky I know, is that I couldn't forward past the opening credits at the begining each episode at the touch of a button. I had to do the fast forward review thing.",1136678400,8,632,4.056
1387569,5,B000051SH3,"Republic was certainly best known for serials, but other studios often got into the act.  One of these was Columbia Pictures.  In truth, Columbia's serials weren't anything to write home about--but there was one exception: the 1943 THE PHANTOM, which cracks along at a memorable pace with an entertaining storyline, some excellent fight choreography, visually interesting set pieces, and a truly fine performance from Tom Tyler in the title role.

Tom Tyler (1903-1954) was a handsome, well-built man who played in well over 150 films between 1924 and 1953--but whose final years was marred by rheumatoid arthritis that reduced him to small supporting roles.  But he was very much at his peak in 1941 when he appeared in the legendary Republic serial THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL--and no less so for the 1943 THE PHANTOM.  Seen today, many serial ""super heroes"" of the 1930s and 1940s look more than a little chubby in their skin-tight costumes, but not Tyler: he had the body to carry it off, and if his acting chops weren't up to the standards of Hollywood's A-List actors they were perfect for this sort of comic book fun.

The story finds the peace of jungle tribes threatened by the evil Dr. Bremmer (Kenneth MacDonald), who seeks to create an airbase for use by an unfriendly country at the long-lost jungle city of Zoloz.  But in order to locate the hidden city, Bremmer must obtain ""the keys""--pieces of a puzzle-like map--from newly arrived Professor Davidson (Frank Shannon) and his party.  Can the Phantom, with the aid of his clever dog Devil, foil Bremmer, protect Davidson, and bring peace to the jungle once more?

You better believe it, but before he does there are crocodiles, lions, tigers, a ""fire princess,"" and booby-traps galore to overcome, most of them cleverly imagined and all of them expertly performed.  Director B. Reeves Eason keeps everything moving at a sharp pace, and if the dialogue and cinematography are seldom inspired they are never less than entertaining, and there's not a dull moment in all fifteen chapters.

Like many serials, THE PHANTOM does adopt certain racial sensibilities that will cause modern viewers to roll their eyes from time to time.  It is actually a bit difficult to tell where this film is supposed to be set: at times the script seems to imply Africa, at other times it seems to imply South America, and the ""natives"" are pretty much clumsy white men in dark make-up who look silly in diaper-like costumes.  Even so, the thing goes like a house afire, and if you're interested in the serial genre this is one you can't afford to miss.

The VCI DVD edition features a nice commentary by Max Allan Collins on ""Chapter One,"" a handful of biographies, and samples of comic book art and lobby cards; the real plus, however, is the quality of the film itself, which is quite fine--and this in spite of an instance where the soundtrack was lost and had to be re-created by modern actors.  The picture quality is very good and the sound is more than adequate.  Recommended to serial fans everywhere!

1387571,4,B000051SH3,"The Phantom is one of the better movie serials put out by Columbia.  It stars frequent movie serial hero, Tom Tyler.  It is an excellant serial from beginning to end.  It does tend to drag in places because of Columbia's strict fifteen chapter format.

I would highly recommend this serial to anyone who loves the genre.  And, also, to those who are just discovering it.",1122508800,4,370,4.630769230769231
1387572,4,B000051SH3,"I've always been fond of the more out-of-the mainstream costumed heroes--The Shadow, The Green Hornet, and The Phantom among them. This chapterplay is good, clean fun. Tom Tyler is just as convincing and rugged as Lee Falk's jungle hero as he was playing the World's Mightiest Mortal, Captain Marvel. The picture and sound quality on the dvd are better than one might expect, given the age of this relatively forgotten film. Indiana Jones it ain't, but if you approach this serial with the same sense of open-minded excitement that Spielberg & Lucas had when they watched serials as kids, you can easily see why they so influenced these now-great filmmakers.",1114732800,7,658,4.990909090909091
1387573,4,B000051SH3,"Most Columbia cliffhangers were made by independent producers, but in 1938-39 and 1943-44 Columbia made its own serials, using the studio's many sets, facilities, and contract players. Columbia's home-grown serials are very efficient, and THE PHANTOM is no exception.
It's a jungle serial, so this writer expected a lot of pedestrian dialogue scenes embellished with old wild-animal footage. It's true that the first chapter falls into this pattern while the story is being set up, but from there it's a lot of fun, almost all of it staged for this production, with Tom Tyler an ideal Phantom. For some reason the supporting cast was not credited, but fans of Columbia will easily recognize Kenneth MacDonald (terrific as the suave villain), Dick Curtis (great to see him play a benign role, for once), Ernie Adams (in a bigger-than-usual role as the Phantom's pal), and some familiar faces in the goon squad (George Chesebro, Wade Crosby, Kermit Maynard, I. Stanford Jolley, Al Hill). Good stuntwork and brisk direction (by B. Reeves Eason) keep this one moving, with Tom Tyler in there punching through 15 chapters. Ace, the Phantom's handsome dog, later became ""Rusty"" the German shepherd in Columbia's family series.
THE PHANTOM has two pleasant surprises for the Columbia serial fan. The recap narration is exceptionally brief (even though the recap footage is lengthy). And each closing ""teaser"" of next week's episode does NOT spoil the suspense by showing the imperiled hero out of danger. Every cliffhanger in THE PHANTOM keeps the viewer guessing, for a welcome change.
The print is excellent, with fine picture and sound. Only Chapter 11 has soundtrack trouble for a few minutes, and the video producers have remedied it as best they could. The DVD release also includes commentary by Max Allan Collins of ""Dick Tracy"" fame. Definitely of interest to serial collectors, and fans of Columbia's ""B"" movies and short subjects will especially enjoy this.",1073347200,29,1961,5.150470219435737
1387574,2,B000051SH3,"I'm a longstanding, die-hard PHANTOM fan and collector; so I was praying that this would be a lost gem. Turns out to be more of a lost zircon. Tom Tyler is pretty darn AWFUL as the Phantom--not a single aspect of this film identifies it as a Phantom story, except for the presence of Devil -- who's supposed to be a wolf, not a German shepherd (although I'll admit it's one gorgeous animal they have cast here)  -- and the Phantom's father. The bad guys consistently and successfully get the drop on Tyler's Phantom, which is not at all typical of the comic strip character. I mean, the thing about the strip version of the character that's so remarkable is his consistency--he's always smarter, faster, stronger, and cagier than the bad guys. Not Tyler's Phantom. And Tyler's Phantom is a terrible shot to boot; the strip Phantom could hit the sweat off a dung beetle on the back of a rampaging bandicoot at 20 yards.
Could they have possibly found a better actor to play the Phantom? Easily. Tyler should have stuck with the 'oaters' and said thanks a heap but heck no to this serial.",1063497600,6,1086,4.540816326530612
1387575,5,B000051SH3,"...These Saturday morning matinee serials are great fun (before television).
Well ""The Phantom"" 1943 serial was once one of these long lost films rediscovered, digitally remastered and thanks to VCI Entertainment is now on DVD.  This 2 DVD set gives us 15 action packed chapters introduces us to this mysterious character.  This is fun stuff.
Summary: Tom Tyler plays ""The Phantom"" and this serial introduces us to this mysterious family who for generations has played ""The Phantom"" the man who never dies.  It seems that a descendent male member must perpetuate the ""Phantoms"" existence.  Why, because the ""Phantom"" is the law of the African jungle & keeps the peace among more than 50 native tribes.  In 15 chapters the Phantom is poisoned to death,(because he knows of the Lost city of Zolov). His son replaces him before he actually dies. (therefore keeping the legend of the man who never dies going.)  Privateers want the hidden treasure of Zolov.  Mysterious nation wants to build secret air field at Zolov.  Phantom is in the middle.  Everyone tries to kill the man who never dies.  For 15 exciting chapters we see how the ""Phantom"" eludes death and escapes periless traps.
The extras include; a One Chapter commentary by famous comic strip writer Max Allan Collins, Biographies, and comic book art.
This is a great secret serial rediscovered for us to watch once again.  Enjoy.",1036108800,123,1386,4.956709956709957

7929479,3,B000051SH3,"I was enjoying this immensely. And, as a matter of fact, the serial deserves 5 stars. The pace was good, and the story was interesting and entertaining. Captain Marvel is still my favorite though....

That said, , the dubbing of chapter 11 temporarily ruined this for me. Full disclosure, I'm picky and anal retentive.  Disc 1 was perfect. Though I can't figure out why 10 chapters were on 1 disc and 5 on the other. Wouldn't 7 and 8 made more sense, or 5 per disc on 3 discs? Regardless, that's neither here nor there.

What I can't fathom, is why some nasally guy came on at the beginning of disc 2 (chapter 11) and did a loud obnoxious dub/recap of the previous chapter. It yanked me right out of it. Forget the fact the guy sounds foolish and the volume disproportionate, but they didn't even take care to keep it consistent. All other recaps, end with the quote ""when suddenly..."". Then the new chapter begins. This guy tried to sound as he assumed people sounded in the 40s. It was more of a bad 1920s flapper immitation.

Once I got past that travesty, I was hit with another one. This one much worse. Once the previous cliffhanger is shown in chapter 11, the character voices are dubbed with strange voices. They're no longer the voices of the actors. I don't know what happened, but for 10 chapters this was great. Chapter 11 came and it was like I entered the Twilight Zone. How can no one else have been bothered this?

I've seen some bad decisions, but this one really boggles my mind. Some people may not have a problem with it, but it really rubbed me the wrong way and tainted an otherwise  enjoyable serial.

[Update]: After some investigation, I discovered the audio track for this chapter couldn't be found. That said, I guess this was necessary, but they could have done a better job. Not much care was taken to make it seamless. I'd rather have this, than no serial at all, but quality needs to count for something. It's lacking here.",1519516800,,1954,4.487323943661972
7929480,4,B000051SH3,I'm glad for the chance of owning this on DVD after seeing it on TCM and that's really all I wanted.  It's a little out of sequence when you want to repeat the title though.,1516320000,,173,3.942857142857143
7929481,4,B000051SH3,"With surprising good acting and a strong story, this serial is just fun for all, and since it was made decades ago, it is just fine for kids to watch.

Most actors look either very skinny or pudgy in hero costume tights. Tom Tyler looks good in the suit, good in a stunt fight, and has a voice that nicely matches what you expect from a hero.

I had never watched this before getting the DVDs, and I am surprised how well the story hangs together. Some of the cliff hanger endings are a bit on the silly side, but there are also clever plot twists beyond what I would have expected. My wife and I have been going thru the series for a few days now and have been quite entertained. Fifty plus years ago this was weekly movie theater fare for many, but if you have never seen these serials, or if you feel an urge to revisit your youth, these DVDs will not disappoint. They are certainly quite different than what you've been used to.

The image quality is about what you'd expect. There are many imperfections in the film image, and the music has the type of distortion and tinny sound that you get used to if you watch old movies or TV shows. However, you quickly get past those flaws and put them out of your mind as you are drawn into the story and the action.

TIP: Since you likely don't want to watch the serial straight thru in one sitting per DVD, it would be nice to have a chapter selection on the menu, right? Well, its there, but not where you would expect it to be, on the front page of the DVD menu. However, just select Special Features, and you'll find the needed and expected Chapter Menu there.

This is a great value for the hours of entertainment, especially if you are or ever were a fan of The Phantom comic strips or comic books.",1508976000,8,1751,4.230538922155689

Shot during WWII, the villain is supposedly Japanese, played by a an enjoyable Caucasian, J. Carroll Nash.  The special effects are really quite good for that period and the plot moves along well.  Acting is also acceptable.  My only regret is, they could have easily found an Asian actor to play the bad guy, much as I enjoyed J. Carroll Nash.",1504569600,,527,4.458333333333333
