8544495,5,B009VH0ALW,"Somehow, many people still don't know the whole truth behind one of the worst ecological disasters of the century. It doesn't help that BP and the other major conglomerates involved in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill have a vested interest in avoiding responsibility, and are not above spouting outright lies to do so.

Beyond Pollution cuts through all the oil companies' rhetoric to reveal the underlying corruption and greed that enabled this catastrophe in the first place. It also reveals BP's systematic campaign to obscure the truth.

Interviewees include residents of the Gulf coast as well as ecologists - the interviews provide a grim reminder of the human cost of the disaster as well as the environmental impact. So many lives, human and animal, have been lost in this disaster, yet BP comes across as completely indifferent. Their refusal to admit the truth in the face of overwhelming evidence comes off as callous to say the very least. Thankfully Beyond Pollution exposes how BP and other corporations shamelessly wage war against the public - though it of course will leave you wondering when things will change.",1375401600,,1131,5.01063829787234
8544496,5,B009VH0ALW,"The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico remains one of the worst ecological disasters of our time and, as it was when it first occurred, BP and many other companies attached to them in the oil spill are still spewing out misinformation and downright lies to the community at large.

Beyond Pollution details the corruption, greed and campaign of lies in a way that hasn't been seen before.  With in-depth interviews and candid comments from residents of the Gulf to experts on wildlife and ecology, Beyond Pollution paints a picture of a company obsessed with profit at all costs that has no regard for life, human or otherwise.

In a country where lies are the norm the lies spewing from this corporate giant are still surprising.  From top to bottom and coast to coast BP has engaged in a systemized and complete web of corruption with no regard to the future consequence and for the truth.

 I was in charge this film would be required viewing for anyone who still believes that things are `OK' in this world of ours. Beyond Pollution is a scary look into the way that oil companies, and many others, operate and makes me terrified for the world that we are leaving to our children.",1375142400,,1184,4.561320754716981
8544497,5,B009VH0ALW,I knew the extent of the oil spill but this film has reminded me of how awful these companies are. They simply don't care about their environment. Everything is in the now with no concern for the future.,1371600000,,203,4.368421052631579
8544498,5,B009VH0ALW,"There are certain documentaries that take your breath away - some because of the beauty of the natural phenomena they share, others because of the horror of war as depicted in photographs and videos with running commentary from the fields where war is happening - both abroad and at home, as in watching the films of 9/11 or the Boston Marathon explosions. A well-made documentary should jolt us to action: BEYOND POLLUTION does just that.

This masterfully constructed and documented film by Barker White places the heinous action of BP oil company in our faces. It is not pretty nor is it sensationalized.  This is excellent reportage of the tragedy of the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill three years ago in April of 2010. The images of the explosion of the oil rig are not unlike the films we have seen of the atomic bomb explosions and the aftermath of that disaster is almost equal - and continues to decimate the peoples in the states touching the Gulf of Mexico.

But very, very wisely Barker White does not solely focus his attention on the BP spill of 2010.  He instead takes us back in history to recap our growing dependency on oil and how that dependency has infiltrated the way our government functions, the way our nation is viewed throughout the world, and the history of the incompetency in the BP company revealed as the hundreds of spills and explosions and deaths and pollution of the atmosphere as well as the ground level and the below the sea level of our planet are recreated: these are all ignored by BP and indeed our government still contracts with these ruthless people.

The film is shocking, terrifying, and makes the level of anger rise and peak. Dean Cain provides a very professional narration of the film, but the many `stars' of the film are the survivors who struggle daily with a problem that just will not get fixed. Everyone who has concerns about our environment should watch this film and spread the word that this is a work of profound importance. April 13",1367193600,7,1990,4.6581196581196584
8544499,5,B009VH0ALW,"Probably one of the most comprehensive documentaries on American oil disasters, ""Beyond Pollution"" covers all the bases. Beginning with the Exxon Valdez debacle, the director and his team recount how since that disaster, the entire areas ecological system has collapsed. The human toll is great as well with serious illness and death accounted for by the clean-up crew.

When the focus is on the BP spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, the truth comes out. Back in the Reagan and Bush years, regulations on the oil industry were so relaxed that hundreds and hundreds of spills occurred over the years. Nearly every single year, there was a major spill somewhere. These are events that most Americans don't know about. Not to lay blame on one side of the political aisle, the commentary shows that even in the Obama administration, not enough was done soon enough or fast enough.

Culminating dozens and dozens of television interviews and news reports, ""Beyond Pollution"" gives a massive amount of history and tragedy which is an ongoing nightmare. Although some of the footage is grainy and old, the sheer lack of accountability of politicians and oil industry executives is crystal clear. The Gulf economy may never get back to normal and the oil that still sits in massive plumes in the Gulf is stunning. This documentary shows that we have yet to fully experience the result of the Gulf oil spill, both ecologically, economically and in health terms. You will learn what really happened, why it happened and who benefited politically and monetarily. The story isn't over. The spills will continue.

This film was generously supplied by Passion River Films for an honest and fair review.",1367107200,3,1691,4.98936170212766
8544500,4,B009VH0ALW,"""Beyond Pollution"" (2012 release; 90 min.) is a documentary that takes a look at the 2010 Gulf oil spill caused by the faulty Deepwater Horizon rig.

Several comments: the last hour of the movie, when it actually looks at the immediate causes of the oil spill, and its after-effects, makes for devastating viewing. The documentary brings a lot of commentary from people directly affected by the spill, intermixed with news footage (mostly CNN) as well as from the congressional hearings where the CEO of BP is grilled by Congress members, and the CEO simply looks like a deer staring into headlights. The culpability of BP (check the documentary's title) is clear to one and all, and BP is still paying the price (literally, as in: the billions of dollars) for this disaster. As the movie makes clear, there was a culture of corner-cutting within BP, exemplified by BP ignoring the advice of its own experts in the days and months leading up to the disaster. Shameful, really, and whatever price BP is paying for this, is not enough.

That said, the first half hour of the movie is a head-scratcher, to say the least. It purports to set the historical context of the 2010 Gulf oil spill, and to me it badly misfires, reason I cannot rate this otherwise great documentary more than 4 stars. For starters, some talking heads I have never have heard of dissect the culture of the Reagan and subsequent adminstrations, which in and of itself is fine, but there is no reason whatsoever to belittle Reagan the person, as one of the commentators does, essentially calling him incompetent (when in fact Reagan is regarded by many independent sources as one of the top 10 presidents of all time). Or calling administration officials ""dumbwits"", which again seems an unneccesary slur. That aside, this is an important documentary that needs to be seen. This week marks the 3rd anniversary of the Gulf oil spill, and it will take many more years to fully assess the ultimate environmental and social impact of this terrible disaster.",1366156800,,2022,4.824207492795389
8544501,5,B009VH0ALW,"Loved this movie. Dean Cain narrates. Gives you a behind the scenes perspective on the BP oil spill, the subsequent cleanup, and long term impact on environment. I usually don't like documentaries but this one was an exception.",1362009600,,227,5.0
8544502,5,B009VH0ALW,"Barker White did a wonderful job.  I had no idea how bad things were in the gulf.  It was an eye opener and something I won't forget.  Keep
 up the great work Barker.",1361059200,,166,3.9393939393939394
