2351826,4,B000A2WA9C,"This was a very different film for me. Not only do we have a black man trying to fit into the Indian life, but we have Indians trying to be accepting of a black man trying to fit into Indian life. Morals and trust are what this film is based on. Do they believe in him enough for him to gain their trust?
I liked the film enough to watch it more than once. It is one to own for the kids. Introduce them to something more than expensive game platforms and television shows that corrupt their minds. Its different and it can be lovable.",1222041600,2,534,4.095238095238095
2351827,4,B000A2WA9C,"When a black teacher takes a job at a reservation high school, he is lumbered with the task of coaching the girls basketball team, a group of no-hopers who've never won a game. As he seeks to create a team, a seemingly impossible goal is presented- can they make it to the state finals? This isn't just about basketball or human relations, it's about the trials, triumphs, aspirations and setbacks of kids supported by teachers and family pursuing a common dream. A good story well scripted, an excellent cast turning in first rate performances, effective direction. This is one of those minor but well made movies that give you more than many a Hollywood blockbuster.",1216166400,,668,4.817391304347826
2351828,4,B000A2WA9C,"I had the priviledge of being indirectly associated with this movie.  The film was based upon the girls basketball program in Shiprock, New Mexico.  In 1987, I watched the championship game between Shiprock High School and Kirtland High School.  One of my teachers at that time (who was also my football and track/field coach) was Mr. Jerry Richardson.

I read through the brochure for the then upcoming Sundance Film Festival in Utah.  As I was skimming the synopses of several film features, I read a very familiar background for the Festival's opening night movie. Immediately, I called a few ""certain"" people and eventually confirmed that this movie was based upon Coach Richardson and the Lady Chiefs.  After pulling off some major schmoozing, I lucked out and scored Opening night passes to this gala event held at Abravanel Hall.

It was great to see this movie.  Although the name and location had been changed because of legal reasons, the general storyline was similar.

But the story of Coach Richardson is a great one.  He was a good person. He brought a lot of character and insight to a community where life can be tough.  And during his coaching tenure there at Shiprock HS, he gave us some vitality.  Sadly, he was killed in auto accident during his coaching tenure with Central Florida University.

It is hard to depict his life from the movie although James McDaniels captured Coach's essence very well to where it was scary.  So here is a better overall portrait.  Picture an African-American man going from a New Mexico Navajo reservation school with several girls basketball state championships under his belt across the Nation to coach a NCAA Division I women's basketball program in Florida.

I guess there is so much more to the story and Chris Eyre did an awesome job with the production contraints he had.  Tim Daly is truly a great person in person as well as producer of this film. Willie Holtzman did an outstanding job with his screenplay and story considering how long and how many hoops he had to jump through to get his script to movie.  But mostly, I think DeLanna Studi gave this movie some serious depth with her acting craft as well as her beauty.  Same goes for the other girls.  Trini King actually played ball at Shiprock HS.

I wish this movie had one of those big blockbuster budgets because it could have seriously been an even better film.  It is good on its own but I'm sure lack thereof of budget led to some of those legal reasons for the name and location changes.  For this reason, I gave it only 4 stars.",1213142400,11,2554,4.677130044843049
2351829,3,B000A2WA9C,"Chris Eyre's movies are always interesting because he lets us glimpse into the lives of contemporary American Indians. ""Edge of America"" is no exception and definitely worth watching.

However, unfortunately, the story does not really explore any of the issues it touches on, such as inter-minority racism, lack of adequate housing on the reservation, economic problems, alcoholism and drug abuse, single parenting, teenage pregnancy, lack of perspectives for teenagers and all the related problems, cultural differences and resulting misunderstandings between minorities, and more.

It was not clear to me why the new English teacher - Kenny Williams - took the job in the first place. At some point he said he ""needed to slow everything down"", but I would have liked to learn more about his motivation to live and teach on an Indian reservation.

I was glad to see Wes Studi in a different role than that of the bad guy, and I enjoyed his exchanges with Mr. Williams, but I did not see a real connection between Mr. Williams and the girls and could not follow the change in their relationship that supposedly happened somewhere along the line.",1203465600,3,1145,5.015789473684211

I can't say enough about the morals and lessons these girls learned from this tough man. It is a terrific movie. In the end, they  are truly surprised. I very much reccommend this DVD!",1171152000,5,352,4.253731343283582
2351832,4,B000A2WA9C,"I saw this film on cable on a weekday afternoon, one of those films  you will probably not catch otherwise: quirky subject, no big stars, no budget.  The plot sounded interesting: black coach, played by the always solid James McDaniel (rarely seen, at least by me, since he left NYPD Blue), coaching a girls basketball team on a reservation. This could be gritty and important, I thought--or sappy and predicatable, another cliched tale of the underdog winning the big game. Pretty quickly it became clear that this was  a gritty and realistic film.  The coach is a complicated character, not always likeable, occassionally downright awful.  The girls are equally realistically drawn. The conflicts we know to be present on Indian reservations around the country are not hidden: unemployment, poverty, alcoholism, bitterness, etc. Sound grim? Somehow this tiny film finds a way to present what could a grim, downbeat story as dramatic, moving, and even funny.  Only later did I discover the director is Chris Eyre, a filmmaker with real and obvious talent (see Skins and Smoke Signals).  So that this movie made us believe in the reality and humanity of its mostly Native characters is no surprise.  This is not a perfect movie by any means. The rival school and its all blonde basketball team and obnoxious coach are cliched.  More backround on McDanial's character would have helped.  But given that, this is actually a stirring, moving film, an unlikely combination of Eyre's earlier Skins and Hoosiers.  You end up caring deeply about these girls and their lives.  The basketball scenes are exciting.  (I won't give away the ending...just to say the girls indeed overcome many obstacles to go to the state championship). McDaniel is indeed interesting and believable as always (know him only from Blue? Check him out in Spike Lee's Malcom X).  Wes Studi is equally interesting and believable.  Heck, the whole cast is interesting and believable.  This will literally make you laugh and make you cry, and the movie earns both emotions legitimately. Check it out.",1146182400,24,2065,5.047197640117994
2351833,4,B000A2WA9C,"Chris Eyre (Director Smoke Signals, Skins) dribbles us onto the hard court of Three Nations woman's Basketball. Kenny Williams (James McDaniel) is running from his past.  He takes an English teaching position on the Three Nations Reservation in Utah. Unbeknownst to school administrators he is black man.  This puts him as a mark for the native students.

  Kenny needs some additional income so he thinks of coaching the dismal O'fer Lady Warrior's basketball team. The interim coach Annie (Irene Bedard) is more of a mother than a coach. The local do-it-all Cuch (Wes Studi) convinces Kenny to coach the woman's basketball team. Coach Williams soon learns that he is fighting an uphill battle with teamwork and Native family traditions especially Mother Tsosie. (Geraldine Keams)

  I absolutely adored this film and totally related to this film. The woman's balling at my old all Native high school was just as competitive with the more expensed mostly white high schools. The gym, attendance and excitement took me back to the days of playing ball for the love of it and close-knit teammates.

  I try not to be a nit pick on an overall good film, but the film started off with some shaky camera angles following Kenny to the Three Nations reservation. (Personal preference) It was probably due to the handheld cameras. After a few minutes it disappeared. Filming the basketball action was comparable to other basketball films that I have seen. But I wished I would have seen the free throws.

  Carla (Delanni Studi), Shirleen (Misty Upham) and Marissa (Deanna Allison) are some of the talented actresses that make up the basketball team. Leroy McKinney (Tim Daly/Producer) is the father of Carla who struggles with the loss of his wife.  And the angry, outspoken Franklin (Eddie Spears) is Carla's boyfriend plays his character outstanding. This film contains a lot of talented Native actors who are now more popular since filming.

  This film was filmed in 2002 for Showtime. Maybe it's just me but these films need to get released to the general public faster.  Though, money is always at the root of the problem. I have to give kudos to Annie Humphrey's songs that fit perfectly for this film.

  Purchase this DVD for the entire family. There are not many extras on the DVD, but there is a filmography for the main actors.",1141689600,35,2333,4.913043478260869

He will if he's successful transforming the girls basketball team from perennial doormats/losers to a hard working, fastbreaking team of winners.

A insightful look into modern day life and times on the Reservation courtesy of director Chris Eyre. James McDaniel gives a solid perfomance as Kenny Williams, the new teacher and coach. Irene Bedard is as always beautiful as the previous coach and mentor to coach Williams. Also excellent supporting role by Wes Studi.

2351847,5,B000A2WA9C,"With the reservation that some sports films aren't all that appealing to me, I'd suggest that this depiction of a true life story may have something for everyone.  There's plenty of real-life drama which doesn't feel at all contrived.  It's really great to see the girls come together and work hard to achieve their goals.  There is occasional rough language, not out of character with the people it's scripted for.

What does perhaps resonate with me is how much life on the REZ strongly resembles my childhood experience with desert living.  Our house which my parents, school teachers also rented was situated on a dirt lane in a really small community.  I still live in the desert,  though it's become a vastly over-developed suburb to the Inland Empire which stretches south of the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains.

One of my earliest learning experiences was memorizing elementary Psalms and New Testament epistle lessons from an ABC book, through a program which required me to recite to a third party outside of my immediate family.  A few land parcels adjacent to our home was the residence of an elderly local librarian for the county and school where dad taught.  She was widowed and lived in a house with wheels on her parents property, there was also her never married older brother, and her parents old house full of stuff.  Her parents were deceased and her brother also lived in a trailer.

Most of the dozen or so homes in a 10 mile radius were homesteads, two bedrooms, a few with carports or out-buildings.  We all had dilapidated old concrete trash incinerators, fallen into dis-use since the county contracted disposal service.  These homes had fire-places or wood stoves, concrete floors with area rugs, and if my dad hadn't always been so unhappy, I wouldn't have known we were poor.

Watching these scenes from the REZ reminds me so much of how small we humans really are upon the earth's terrain.  When I was just a toddler, the immensity of the San Bernardino mountains were so close to my front door that shadows of the rising sun caused them to glow like great luminous cliffs of saphire, reflecting the azure tones of sky light where the suns rays were sheerly indirect.  As an adult, I've driven past this art-in-nature repeatedly.  Most of my contacts daily are with people I'm convinced have never felt the earth beneath their feet.

In the film there's a shot of Mr. Williams the new school teacher driving a long straight road to the REZ, where the atmosphere nearly occludes the path through the basin before him.  It's so very like one Barstow road, perhaps an hour's drive from my present location.  It's a little like viewing Mexico  from a mountain in San Diego, where earth grants you a sensation of her curvature, or gazing out at Catalina Island from Laguna Hills.  If you notice Mama Sosa listening intently to the basketball game her daughter is playing, her ear right next to her radio, even though she's sternly displayed her disapproval, then maybe you can sense the proportions I'm describing.  You cannot feel it in your television screen.  You must extend the grasping of your mind round about it.",1400025600,4,3156,4.789279112754159

I was surprised by some of the young actors, and it was nice to see some familiar faces from smoke signals.  If you like smoke signals you will like this.  There is only ONE reason I give it an an ehhh its okay rating.  It is the same reason that will kill any good even ""would have been great"" movie had they left ONE DARN element out of the film. . . . . (and I would be using a much stronger word here if I could) WHY ON EARTH, do these new film makers feel it is necessary to have a vomit scene?  SERIOUSLY?  And right at the camera??????
COME ON!!!!!!!!!
I am sick to death of it! It's gross, uneccesary and brings on anxiety over whether or not they are going to do it again in the film and for those of you who DO NOT like scenes like that . . . don't buy this film.
If they had just left that crud out of the film this would have gotten five stars.  The setting is realistic, the story line is believeable and the actors did a great job, and because of this one gross element, personally, it just killed the DARN movie.  I'll probably end up selling it at a garage sale this summer for a dollar just so I don't make the mistake of being exposed to that again.
Enough with the throw up scenes, it's just unecesary.  There have been plenty of great films made without this overdone transparent shock value tactic of showing someone throwing up.  It doesn't IMPACT me as a viewer to emphasize anything in a positive light . . . this kind of impact is just a gross factor that makes me feel like I wasted my money and will end up tossing. If you have a strong stomach . . then hey, it won't bother you.  But for those of who do . . . .pass it up.",1369008000,,1736,4.029154518950437

2351865,4,B000A2WA9C,"Rick Darby, an independent film maker, went to Shiprock, New Mexico, to document what he perceived to be a fascinating story about a Navajo Reservation girls High School basketball program, the Lady Chieftains, and their ""unusual"" coach, Jerry Richardson.  After years of filming, stated financial and legal difficulties, and the tragic death of Coach Richardson, Darby put together ""Rocks With Wings"" (the translation of the Navajo word for the Shiprock formation that dominates the community).  The documentary aired on PBS on 12/10/2002, and went on to win the Documentary Feature Prize at the 2002 Urbanworld Film Festival.

At some point along the way, Chris Eyre--a Cheyenne/Arapaho, award-winning film director and producer--teamed up with Tim Daly and Showtime to make a theatrical version of the story.  Partially because Darby was attempting to get greater distribution for his film, and partially due to other undisclosed legal reasons, Eyre, Daly and Showtime, along with the creativity of Willy Holtzman's script, were able to alter details of the story to make their film.  The made for television movie, ""Edge of America,"" premiered in the Netherlands on 10 December 2003; and in the US on 2 May 2004.  I highly recommend both films, although only ""Edge of America"" is currently available from Amazon.com (see comments about how to obtain ""Rocks With Wings"").

While ""Edge of America"" has excitement, drama, comedy, and most of the advantages of a Hollywood movie, including superb acting by the young actresses playing the basketball players, ""Rocks with Wings"" does a better job of putting the feat of winning the 1988 New Mexico State Championship title into perspective with Navajo culture and traditions.  Moreover, for me, ""Edge of America"" works to too hard to ""sanitize"" the vast difference between Coach Richardson, the other coaches, and the community (of Shiprock).  ""Edge of America,"" also seems to be a movie more about Coach Richardson than the Lady Chieftains of Three Nations Reservation High School in Utah (actually of Shiprock High School, Shiprock, New Mexico, on the Navajo Reservation).  And, I think to a large degree, ""Edge of America"" over emphasizes the fact that Jerry Richardson was black, from a poor town in Texas, and the ""victim"" of bigotry.  I suspect the later is emphasized to increase interest in the story.  And while ""Edge of America"" portrays the community coming together behind Coach Richardson, nothing in the research I have done suggests that such a ""happy"" reconciliation of differences actually happened.

There are several other important ""factual"" differences between ""Edge of America"" and the actual story.  Richardson actually started out as a football coach (as one other reviewer discusses), then joined the coaching staff before becoming the head coach.  There were several other non-Native coaches besides Richardson, including Bill Dowty who transferred from nearby rival Kirtland Central High School.  Perhaps equally important is the fact that Kirtland did not have an all non-Indian basketball team (indeed, prior to Shiprock's rise, many Navajo families moved to Kirtland so their children could play for those teams).  Also, to the best of my knowledge, Kirtland is not a ""stronghold"" of Mormanism as alluded to in the film.

In the final analysis, however, despite all of these criticisms of ""Edge of American,"" I feel compelled to re-iterate that the film is very, very good.  It is, in deed, exciting, entertaining, moving and fun to watch, and I would highly recommend the film.
