8464337,5,B005BU3E1G,"I Heart Vampires is THE BEST WEB SHOW EVER!!! I am sooo happy that they put it on DVD. If you like Twilight but wish it had more comedy you will like this show. It has drama, romance, action and comedy all in one. I will put the description of the show below this but if you buy/like this show you have to check out their other shows such as I Heart Vampires season 2(also on dvd), Talent the Series, My Alibi, First Day and many more shows that can be found on their website Take180.com or on their youtube channel TheSoWhat(just go to youtube and search TheSoWhat and it will pop up). If you can't tell already I am an avid fan of Take180 and I hope they keep up the great work and make another season of I Heart Vampires(you will too once you see it)!!!!

This is the Description off of Take180's website:

Corbin is the #1 fan of the Confessions of a High School Vampire book series, running the fansite IHeartVampires.net with her best friend, Luci. After Corbin leaks part of the final novel, the ""fangosphere"" explodes, sending the girls on an adventure where they cross paths with the mysterious Nick, and their lives begin to imitate the very series that they love.

P.S:  Take180 is so awesome that not only did they take the website(IHeartVampires.net) from the show and make it real with real blogs on it the made the book a real thing also. Now you can't go and buy the book but you can read parts from it on their website(Take180.com). Just more reasons to Get Sucked In!!!",1310688000,4,1487,4.3963636363636365
