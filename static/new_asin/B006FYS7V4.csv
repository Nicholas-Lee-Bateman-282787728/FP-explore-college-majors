Highly recommended.",1369353600,,175,4.333333333333333
8497237,3,B006FYS7V4,"This was playing on a LodgeNet channel at a resort I was staying at, and I could not take my eyes off it!  It is a series of music videos backed by some of the most creative and diverse electronic music that I have heard in one collection.  When I received my DVD, however, I could not get it to play in any of my 3 DVD players.  If you are technically proficient with video software, you may be able to extract the movies and make your own DVD from that.  Beyond that, though, the original disc does not work as it should.",1359244800,,523,4.048543689320389
