8551082,2,B00AFQSXRQ,"Supposedly based on some kind of true tale about Griffith Park in LA being cursed by a blind woman who was robbed of the land by a last minute will change. Years later a descendant discovers a treasure map, a treasure protected  by a ummm....guy in a dog suit? The characters were juvenile as was the plot. This felt like it was made for TV. Very low impact horror.

Part of a DVD 8 pack.",1460937600,,388,4.16
8551083,2,B00AFQSXRQ,"Two minute watch to get the entire plot and the ending.  The acting is bad and the creature looks like a cheap brown sack with teeth.

Plot is about as dumb as it gets.  And nothing in the film provides any sensation it is real or involves you in any fashion.

Two stars is pushing it.",1459814400,,285,4.035714285714286

8551087,3,B00AFQSXRQ,"Beast Beneath is a pretty good flick, I liked the plot. The idea of a connection to a Spanish land grant and the supernatural is great. The beast does it's mayhem in darkness and its appearance is kept in shadows virtually the whole movie, except for a single cameo late in the flick. Looks like a halloween mask of a baboon/s face. No great chase scenes in this one.",1428451200,,367,4.333333333333333

8551089,1,B00AFQSXRQ,"This is what happens when so many people that want to act, has access to equipment, in a city like Los Angeles.
The person that wrote this script wanted to give it dept. unfortunately the bad script, bad acting, bad effects, bad everything ruined the whole thing. This movie never had a chance. Don't waste your money and time on this piece of unadulterated crapola. I watch horrible movies like this, just to torture myself.

So if anybody ever wants to watch this thing around you, run for the hills and never stop.",1387238400,5,517,4.559139784946237
