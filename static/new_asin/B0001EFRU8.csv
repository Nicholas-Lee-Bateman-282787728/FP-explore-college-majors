1994381,1,B0001EFRU8,Poor quality - chopped up clips; not complete matches. Totally dissatisfied with this DVD which was purchased as a birthday gift for my son.  We wasted money on this purchase.,1095465600,20,175,4.833333333333333
1994382,4,B0001EFRU8,"Playing Peek A Boo With Mike Tyson
Mixed feelings here - Tyson and the fights are GREAT  - I'm not sure if it's just the copy I have, but the quality of the DVD was poor - i.e. it looked like the fights were transferred from an old VHS tape and on to DVD - somewhat grainy and just not near DVD quality.
The only other negative comment I have is that the fights are edited. It's not the full fights. It's highlights and/or a few minutes of the rounds. I would have preferred the entire rounds unedited.
This is a must have for any Tyson fan. You forget how spectacular Mike was at the beginning of his career. The lightening quick hands, the fluid lateral movement and that hypnotic Peak-A-Boo style!
Iron Mike was and in my opinion still is one of the greatest fighters of all times!
If you're a Tyson fan - you will need this for your collection.",1087516800,27,848,4.234567901234568
1994383,5,B0001EFRU8,"Like Malcolm I was also a lil surprised by the editing cutting out parts of the rounds and the packaging was kind of cheesy but those are only minor flaws.  Since I receive the dvds I have been watching them non stop. Mike Tyson is the most entertaining boxer of all time. It shows the Mike kicking butt as usual and acting bizzare once in a while.
This video package is great for entertainment when you have company over.  When I let my friends check out the video they were in awe and the were constantly making me rewind parts of the video to see some of the knock out punches again.  This dvd package is the best $35 I have ever spent.  For every so called boxing fan this is a must have.  And there needs to be more videos like this for other hard hitting legends like HolyField, Foreman, Jones Jr.",1078012800,,803,4.222222222222222
1994384,2,B0001EFRU8,"I just bought this video.  I'm a big Tyson fan especially early in his career.  Hence, I was excited to receive this package.  Once I opened it and played the video, I was dismayed with the editing of it.  I was told that the fights were in there ""entirety"".  This is entirely not true.  The fights are broken, cut, & pasted.  There seems to be no skill in this because sometimes when the fighters are mixing it up, the DVD skips to 10 seconds later.  There are no interviews which is a part of the fight I like and no previews, which I use to like on HBO.  But what really hurts the quality is that the fights are not complete.  This in itself hurts this collection of videos as a ""collectors piece"" because their not originial in any sense of the word...",1077580800,8,756,4.223776223776224
8011355,1,B0001EFRU8,Skipping ahead in fights 30 seconds or more at a time. Poor quality awful set. I ordered another set off of e-bay.,1447372800,,114,4.2272727272727275
8011356,1,B0001EFRU8,It's like watching a low budget production. Image quality is very bad and each fight they skip through it 30 seconds ahead . Not full fights . Do not buy ..,1429228800,,156,4.064516129032258

8011360,1,B0001EFRU8,The material is very grainy.  This product is an embarrassment to Amazon.  I was able to record all of those fights on You Tu be with much better results.  It was advertised as having way more fights than it had.  It turns our it was volume 3 of 3.  I was so busy recovering from hip surgery or I would have returned it long ago.  I suggest Amazon take a look at what this vendor is selling.,1374451200,,391,4.012987012987013
8011361,3,B0001EFRU8,"My DVD did arrive quickly, which was good, but, the first DVD (there are 3) doesn't read/work at all. The fights are not shown in their entirety, and the quality is average or less.  Still, it is Tyson, and it was cool to watch!",1250121600,,228,4.181818181818182
8011362,1,B0001EFRU8,"I have to wonder if this release is even legitimate.  By that, I mean did the producer even buy the rights to the fights?  If so, why does each and every fight look like it was copied from VHS?  The best example of this is in the Spinks fight, where horizontal lines reminiscent of VHS tapes with poor tracking are clearly visible.  In fact, the resolution looks even worse (more grainy) than VHS & more like something that was lifted from youtube.

To say that I do not recommend this video would be a vast understatement.  Moreover, the content is worth little more than the mere DVD media and its packaging.  This video is an insult to Mike Tyson, as well as the sport of boxing and its fans.",1240617600,2,695,4.341085271317829
8011363,2,B0001EFRU8,"Tyson may be my favorite boxer to watch. There's nothing quite like the relentless fury and brutal power that a young Mike brought into the ring. And this DVD set does have some of his great bouts. The only problem is, they're not presented in their entirety, or even in a decent picture quality. I suppose edited fights aren't all that bad a thing--if the editing job is done right. This editing job, however, was done oh-so-wrong. Without rhyme or reason, in the middle of a flurry or not, suddenly the video jumps ahead half-a-minute or so, then does it again and again and again. This is pretty much how the entire DVD plays out.

At this price, for the number of bouts listed and on DVD format, you'd think you're getting a great deal. You're not. You'd do yourself a favor by just typing ""Mike Tyson Career DVD"" into any search engine. There are plenty of independent sites out there that specialize in boxing videos, and though they're most likely more expensive, any of those would probably be a better deal that you'd get buying this set.",1099612800,25,1047,4.569148936170213
