This is dedicated to the Armor Group of the US Army. A small tank group joined the British Eighth Army in North Africa to gain experience. This tank is ordered to retreat to the south. They find a few British stragglers. Their talk tells about their condition and personality. [That M3 Lee tank was obsolete by 1942.] They must conserve their water and gasoline, and work together to survive and fight again. One British Sudanese and his Italian prisoner join them. This sergeant knows the local trail to a water well. What will they do with the prisoner? [A dramatic scene.] An enemy fighter machine guns the tank until it is shot down. The pilot parachutes and is captured and searched. But one man was wounded. This Nazi pilot shows his arrogance and contempt for his captors. They find the well, but it is dry! The radio calls them back for the battle. A building offers a refuge from the wind and sand. Can they find a well?

Yes, but it is nearly dry too. They share this scarce resource. German soldiers are on their trail, they must get water too. The soldiers talk about their lives. An enemy scout car approaches and is neutralized. Two prisoners are questioned, one talks for water. The tank sergeant discusses their options: stay or go? Can they trade water for food? A volunteer will drive the scout car ahead for help, the rest stay behind to prepare an ambush against 500 enemy soldiers. An enemy officer offers terms of surrender! No deal. Can Waco bring help? One man talks about his future. The enemy attacks in force. One prisoner escapes but is stopped. The enemy soldiers are thirsty. Will they surrender their arms? Or pull a trick? The defenders are running low on ammunition now. Waco now travels on foot. He is rescued by a patrol in a jeep. The enemy attacks again! But this time they come to surrender arms for water. An explosion affected the water in the well! They leave with many prisoners and find their rescuers. They learn of the victory at El Alamein.

This movie was typical of war-time entertainment that promised a victory for the United Nation against the Axis Powers. Its still an entertaining movie. Could ten men hold off 500 enemy soldiers? That would depend on their arms and defensive position. Note that these soldiers do not have beards after many days. That tommygun was the civilian version, not the military version of WW II. Those WW I Springfield rifles would be accurate in the early days of the war.",1475193600,2,2472,4.639269406392694
