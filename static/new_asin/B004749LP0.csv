8417665,5,B004749LP0,"We are now up to Volume 4 of the D-I-D four disc sets, easily order-able from the Australian distributor. The most recent set has a great collection of Hammer trailers.",1387497600,,168,4.633333333333334
8417666,1,B004749LP0,"I sure didn't like that this disc is full of trailers ripped directly from blue underground and anchor bay  dvds, many of which I already own. pic quality is decent but not as good as the source. Nothing is taken from original film prints and some look like vhs. Sonny Chiba's streetfighter is trashed in a homemade trailer taken from 2 different sources.",1384041600,4,355,4.634920634920635
8417667,5,B004749LP0,"This has to be the best trailer collection I have ever seen and I do mean ever, you get 12 hours of trailers on a 4 DVD set.
The trailers are also grouped into sections like all animal attack films together, women in prison films and so on.
The quality is pretty good too with most of the trailers in widescreen and the picture and sound is fine, even on a HDTV.
I was amazed to just how much is on here and it is one trailer set any fan should go out of their way to find, trust me, you won't be sorry, this collection is huge.

Please Note: This review applies to the Australian set using the same name.",1304899200,4,605,4.0
