8686904,4,B00P8LS5I0,"This is a 91 minute DVD. Despite the box being labeled that it has closed captions - there are none.
The box also states that the contents are the ""personal journey of an amazing couple"".
It does contain some information about their personal lives, although it never mentions Nancy was herself adopted, but brings up his adopted children. There is an emphasis on Nancy's influence, but it does avoid the gaze Nancy adopted while Reagan was speaking and also her interest in astrology.

There are many excerpts from Reagan's speeches which demonstrate why he was called the great communicator. Brief and speedy clips give glimpses of the hostage's return, Pan Am 103's bombing, and the Nicaragua Contras.
This is more of a personal look that includes the Reagan's political life. It is an interesting look, but not one of much depth.",1438387200,,832,4.900709219858156
