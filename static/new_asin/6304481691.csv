886521,5,6304481691,"Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, denounced as naive and slanderous when it appeared in 1939, has proven to be one of the most accomplished pieces of political propaganda in cinematic history, rivaling  - nay, surpassing - Eisenstein's Potemkin and Riefenstahl's Triumph des  Willens as an attempt to render the political operations of mass society  visible and sympathetic on the screen. The film contrasts two sorts of  cynicism, an aggressive self-interest (Taylor) and a disillusioned nihilism  (Paine, Saunders), and through the exaggeration of Stewart's pure reflection  of a pseudo-democratic authoritarian ideology, unveils the first as  unredeemable and the second redeemable. What makes the film so striking and  durable, is the absence of any mention of voting in it. Rather, opinion  polling, back-room deals, and opaque parliamentary procedures constitute a  government in effect divorced from popular control. The slightly hysterical  investment in American symbols, and their anchoring in immature emotional  perspectives (Boy's Stuff), suggests how difficult it is to legitimate  bureaucratic American oligarchy in traditional Enlightenment terms. This is  not a criticism. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is arguably the founding  document of post-democratic American ideology: America cannot be understood  without this film. Overwhelming!",929491200,,1364,5.953608247422681
886661,5,6304481691,I used the scene where Jeff Smith first arrived & saw the sights in class before a trip to Washington DC. Made a great impression on students. What a terrific movie about how we hope government will be and the ugly reality of politics. Still relevant. And don't overlook the poignant sight of Jimmy Stewart proclaiming the greatness of the American republic just a few years before he would fly in its defense in World War II.,1522540800,,426,4.545454545454546

886666,1,6304481691,This movie is the worst thing I've seen since I was tricked into watching Gravity. Jimmy Stuart is obsessed with little boys in this film and it has not aged well.  Not even a rousing performance by Baby Dumpling can salvage this film.,1518480000,,235,4.465116279069767

I hope all politicians and government folks aren't corrupt or so jaded and cynical. The movie is actually low on entertainment value. The acting is mostly good though Stewart's manic behaviour is Rather annoying. It not only portrays the political machine as corrupt and Stewart as childish and in a good way, it postulates that people are really stupid, easily led, and blind sheep believing everything they're fed, despite what they see or know from past experience. Though good always triumphs over evil, (yeah, right), this picture paints a pretty bleak outlook on humanity as a whole and certain groups in particular. We may watch it again ""someday.""

Get out yer flags.  I watch it for the nostalgia value mostly... remembering a time that never existed.  Frankly, it's BS - and that's what Jimmy was best at selling.  USA ""democracy"" fantasy stories.  Washington is and always has been a viper's den, we don't live in a democracy, and we all know that.  But hey - this is not a reality flick.  In the real world, Jimmy's character would have been given a case of ""depression"".  lol  So enjoy watching him take down Mr Big in this movie.

886859,4,6304481691,"The dialog might be a tad bit hokey by todays standards but the core idea of an honest politician in Washington DC makes a compelling story.  Mr. Smith is the only one of the politicians in the movie who sticks to his morals and will not be bought.  He is nave and believes that all his fellow senators became politicians to make positive changes for their respective states, not for personal gain or political power.  He finds out he was gravely mistaken.  His one main alley in the film besides his assistant, and the boys he represents, is the president himself.

You see in the film what kind of corruption and lies can be drummed up by ones own political party if they don't vote the way they are supposed to, according to party bosses.  With all the strong lobbyists in Washington, this film is as relevant today as when it came out in 1939 with much the same atmosphere.  Conscience be damned if you won't vote the way they tell you to they will find some patsy who will gladly take your place and will.  The long reach of the political boss may be factitious in the movie but there is no doubt the length they would go to in real life to destroy someones livelihood or career to anyone that opposes them.

James Stewart is an excellent actor and he owns this role.  Jean Arthur also does a fine job in the film.  You can see her disgust with her dreamer congressmen boss.  But at the same time after she spends time with him she sees something in him a natural speaker, full of charisma and strong values.  She starts to identify with him why people should serve in politics and what it should be like.

I thought for sure that when the boys were being attacked by the thugs and stooges that Clarissa would inform Jeff by note on the senate floor and publically shame Senator Joseph Paine that way after receiving the phony mail in the courtroom before passing out.  I think that would have broken Paines reserve and force his hand to come clean with the truth more effectively.

The film ends very abruptly, probably the way they shot these types of movies back then.  You never do get to find out what happens to Jefferson Smith or if he ends up marring his assistant or what happened when he returned back to his own state.  The film is definitely worth watching and I would rate it 4 1/2 stars.",1496102400,,2306,4.385882352941176

887110,5,6304481691,"This movie was released in 1939 at the eve of World War II.  It is an unlikely, idealized story about a fine naive young man appointed to the United States Senate and then thrown to the wolves in a corruption frame up.  Justice prevails and good overcomes evil.

The fact that the movie was banned by the Nazis and the Soviets makes it good enough for me.  The movie stars James Stewart, who is a real life great patriotic American.  James Stewart was in a number of my favorite movies.

Jean Arthur also stars in this movie.  She also was in another of my all time favorite movies, ""Shane"".  Frank Capra directed this movie.  Mr. Capra is also a great iconic director.  The movie is stylistically dated and idealized.  But it is an all time great movie and well worth viewing.

In the event that a viewer enjoys this 1939 movie, one might consider a lesser known movie from 1940 as a follow up, ""The Great McGinty"".  Thank You...",1479168000,,930,4.431952662721893

887193,5,6304481691,"Recently I wrote a short review of a Cary Grant and Jean Arthur film, Talk of the Town, where I argued that while the film could certainly be held without any ado as a good example of a romantic comedy from the golden age of such films. I argued though that the film had more merit as a social drama since while there were plenty of light-hearted moments the theme of the virtue of the rule of law trumped the obvious romantic interest between the two stars (and add in a third player Ronald Colman as well). I am in a similar quandary on the film under review, Frank Capras Mister Smith Goes To Washington. In that previous review I noted that Frank Capra along with Preston Sturgis and George Stevens  (I left the question of Howard Hawks to the readers choice) was one of the great directors of romantic comedy during the golden age of the genre in the later 1930s and early 1940s when anybody who had any sense knew the general population needed a little escapist humor with the onslaught of the Great Depression and the World War grinding them down. But I also argued that the subject matter-the threat to the rule of law which underscored the plot line made that film a vehicle for social drama as well.

I want to argue for a similar conclusion on this on. Heres the play. A U.S. Senator, in an unnamed state but presumed to be out in the heartland where people overall were not as jaded as elsewhere and still believed in some of the old truths even in the late 1930s when America was going to hell in a hand-basket, had died. The bosses who ran the state and ran the governor couldn't decide on a suitable candidate and so one so-called apolitical do-gooder, one Jefferson Smith (already we can get the flags out with that name), played by Jimmy Stewart, got the nod. The assumption was that he would do the bidding of the organization while it was stealing everything that was not nailed down, specifically a big boondoggle dam project where everybody who was in on the deal would get well, including the senior Senator, Joe Paine, from the state, played by Claude Rains last seen in this space walking arm and arm with Humphrey Bogart in the fog after giving the Germans the what for in the classic film, Casablanca.

Of course old Jeff was the classic believer in good government, believed in the whole nine yards, probably believed that George Washington actually did chop down that cherry tree just like Parsons Weems said. Nave, a babe in the woods, he got to Washington and was ready to serve with pride. Except he had this idea, this national boys camp idea that he planned to run through Congress as a way to instill true democratic values in future generations. (Girls, I guess, were just supposed to sit around and look pretty.) Problem, big problem in the end; the boys camp idea ran smack against the big dam boondoggle. The fight was on.

I mentioned that this film could be a romantic comedy at some level. That idea would come into play when Jefferson brought his wised-up to the ways of Washington super- secretary Clarissa, played by heartland wised up Jean Arthur, into his orbit, got her on his side in the fight for the boys camp despite her cynicism after having been around the town a little too long. But get this, or rather get two things. This Jeff was not built to be a good old boy, to carry some bosss water, he had fighting for lost causes in his bones, grabbed a few such genes from his father, a newspaperman shot when he got too close to the dark side of politics and couldn't be bought. The other thing is that while Jeff had more illusions than anybody should be allowed to have and still be allowed within fifty miles of the Washington zip codes he was not a quitter. Stood up to the bosses and their stooges, including that Joe Paine who had been a friend of his fathers but who was being held up in this film as the consummate sell-out to the big interests.

Here is the really funny part. The way old Jeff won his battle was through an old-fashioned filibuster, you know he took and kept the floor until exhaustion set in to prove his point. Now since the time of the film, 1939, the filibuster has been used for less worthy fights like against civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s and now to basically try to close down the government. So a filibuster seems an odd way now to make his point but there you have it. That pluck and Clarissa pulling for him from the sidelines. I mentioned in that The Talk of the Town review that that film was more of a social drama than a romantic comedy now that I have given you the skinny on this one I think this one follows that same path. You decide, okay.",1472342400,,4654,4.4132712456344585

We also hear about watchdog groups that try to expose these crooks but little or nothing is done to them. Only the higher-ups get into the papers for the sensationalism. Watergate, Iran/Contra et al, it never seems to end. And when there IS a truly slow newsday, the Newspapers, TV News and the Internet blow something out of proportion like a celebrity scandal or some relatively minor police action.

The story is about Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a political novice who is appointed by his state's political machine after the death of the previous incumbent. Senator Smith's major project is to build a boys' camp in his home state, with the help of a Federal loan, which would then be paid back by the boys' camp members. Unfortunately, the state's political bosses want to build a dam on that site, and frame Senator Smith on the false charge that he stands to make a big profit from the land where the boys' camp will be built. Senator Smith almost resigns, but is talked out of it by his assistant Saunders (Jean Arthur). In the end, Senator Smith stages a long filibuster against the bill blocking the boys' camp, and despite the opposition of his fellow senators, his home-state machine, and even the local media, finally proves his innocence and wins the fight. Unfortunately, Washington politics has changed little in the 78 years since this 1938 film was made (think Ted Cruz versus Mitch McConnell).

As good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-a-Wonderful-Life-60th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;is, MR.

There's no ""sketchy"" or ""hard edge"" storyline or characters, although the showdown is rather intense, politically speaking. The story is essentially about political temptation & corruption vs. blind idealism, and how they play off against each other. By a fateful turn of events, Smith, a Ranger Scout (Boy Scout), becomes a U.S. Senator. His main foil is a fellow senator, a man who was once idealistic but became corrupt through political temptation.  Smith learns of the political corruption involving his fellow senator, and the power behind this puppet legislator, and feels compelled to expose it. The corrupt political machine goes into action to utterly destroy Smith (not unlike today's political environment).  Smith decides to stand alone against the machine with just one sly political insider supporting him, his political ""babysitter"", who wises him up and prepares him for battle in an outstanding ""strong yet not masculine"" female role (listen up Hollywood, one woman beating up five guys is getting old). In the end good prevails, but just as in Capra's other films, the villain does not have to be annihilated or physically destroyed, rather the audience simply moves past him onto other, more important elements of human character, which defeats the villain on the basis of the hero's overarching rightness rather the antagonist's terms of petty destruction. In this particular case the other senator finds a type of harsh reconciliation with his conscious, if not outright redemption. A film well worth watching again and again, especially with young, impressionable viewers.

And in response to a viewer who asked how to get his 13 year old daughter to watch, I suggest putting it on after it's her bedtime, and letting her ""talk you into staying up late"". Let her outsmart you (in her mind at least). And then you can insist that she make a future concession for the one you made by letting her stay up late, and thereby win twice on the deal.",1456444800,,2079,5.002890173410405

887443,5,6304481691,"A beautiful remaster of a masterpiece!

One of the great early films of cinema starring Jimmy Stewart in a multi-faceted performance and directed by Frank Capra. Capra uses faces with intimate and realistic human reactions throughout, populating the screen with real moments. He carefully times the scenes for their potency and uses energetic editing to progress the story of a corrupt system that uses societies passions and sincere emotions to veil their trickery and damnation of everything and everyone that opposes their own selfish goals. Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is the quintessential film of these ideals and curses of modern society. In a great and imaginative sequence Mr. Smith visits landmarks in Washington that enshrine the ideals of liberty and freedom. Capra over laps the United States flag throughout most of those shots until he ends the scene in a beautifully lit wide shot of the Lincoln Memorial. We recognize our world in this 1939 masterpiece with much more awareness than people would have in the beginning of World War II. It was at the height of naivety in certain fractions of the States. This was before their involvement in the Great War, before the assassination of both Kennedys and Martin Luther King. It was before many maladies of a growing and corrupting world. Mr. Smith Goes To Washington really captures the tormented souls and the corrupted souls with a keen awareness of human nature, a dynamic range of emotions; it is a three dimensional film! And in those final scenes leading to the finale where Mr. Smith takes the stage at the White House to voice his truth and be mightier than the sword of injustice, we are captivated by Jimmy Stewarts performance and the power he brings to the screen! A rare gem in cinema, dating two years before Citizen Kane.",1447804800,,1800,4.921052631578948

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Mr. Smith Goes to Washington [1939] is producer/director Frank Capra's classic comedy-drama, and considered by many to be his greatest achievement in film (and reminiscent of his earlier film, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town [1936]. In fact, the film project by Columbia Pictures was first announced as Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington starring Gary Cooper, in a role similar to his previous Longfellow Deeds character.

Frank Capra's classic comedy-drama established James Stewart as a lead actor in one of his finest (and most archetypal) roles. The film opens as a succession of reporters shout into telephones announcing the death of Senator Samuel Foley. Senator Joseph Paine [Claude Rains], the state's senior senator, puts in a call to Governor Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper [Guy Kibbee] reporting the news.

Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper then calls powerful media magnate Jim Taylor [Edward Arnold], who controls the state and along with the lawmakers. Jim Taylor orders Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper to appoint an interim senator to fill out Senator Samuel Foley's term; Jim Taylor has proposed a pork barrel bill to finance an unneeded dam at Willet Creek, so he warns Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper he wants a senator who ""can't ask any questions or talk out of turn."" After having a number of his appointees rejected, at the suggestion of his children Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper nominates local hero Jefferson Smith [James Stewart], leader of the state's Boy Rangers group.

Jefferson Smith is an innocent, wide-eyed idealist who quotes Jefferson and Lincoln and idolises Senator Joseph Paine, who had known his crusading editor father. In Washington, after a humiliating introduction to the press corps, Jefferson Smith threatens to resign, but Senator Joseph Paine encourages him to stay and work on a bill for a national boy's camp. With the help of his cynical secretary Clarissa Sanders [Jean Arthur], Jefferson Smith prepares to introduce his boy's camp bill to the Senate. But when he proposes to build the camp on the Willets Creek site, Jim Taylor and Senator Joseph Paine force him to drop the measure. Jefferson Smith discovers Jim Taylor and Senator Joseph Paine want the Willets Creek site for graft and he attempts to expose them, but Senator Joseph Paine deflects Jefferson Smith's charges by accusing Smith of stealing money from the boy rangers.

Defeated, Jefferson Smith is ready to depart Washington, but Clarissa Sanders, whose patriotic zeal has been renewed by Jefferson Smith, exhorts him to stay and fight. Jefferson Smith returns to the Senate chamber and, while Jim Taylor musters the media forces in his state to destroy him, Jefferson Smith engages in a climactic filibuster to speak his piece: ""I've got a few things I want to say to this body. I tried to say them once before and I got stopped colder than a mackerel. Well, I'd like to get them said this time, sir. And as a matter of fact, I'm not gonna leave this body until I do get them said.""

Jefferson Smith, of course, stands his ground, so the two men set about ruining him. This eventually leads to an unforgettable filibuster scene that solidified James Stewarts persona and the first persona of his multi-dimensional career, anyway, as a common man with bottomless reserves of backbone and dignity. (James Stewart, in a move worthy of an Oscar, had a doctor administer dichloride of mercury near his vocal chords to give his voice the exhausted rasp he was looking for at the close of Jefferson Smiths filibuster.)

Though its now universally revered as an ode to democratic ideals, Frank Capras Mr. Smith Goes to Washington [1939] was originally denounced by many Washington power-brokers. That may come as a bit of a shock if you haven't seen this classic picture for several years. Jimmy Stewarts lead performance made him a star, and is justly remembered as the key component of a beautifully constructed narrative. But Frank Capra, for all his flag-waving and sometimes naive moralizing saved a great deal of bite for the hallowed halls of American government.

Frank Capra nearly cast Gary Cooper, but finally settled on James Stewart. I knew he would make a hell of a Mr. Smith, he said. He looked like the country kid, the idealist. It was very close to him. James Stewart knew this was the role of a lifetime, one that could place him near the top of the Hollywood heap. Jean Arthur later remembered his mood at the time: He was so serious when he was working on that picture; he used to get up at five oclock in the morning and drive himself to the studio. He was so terrified something was going to happen to him, he wouldnt go faster.

On 17th October, 1939, the picture was previewed at Washingtons Constitution Hall. The preview was a major production featuring searchlights and a National Guard band playing patriotic tunes; The Washington Times-Herald even put out a special edition covering the event. Four thousand guests attended, 45 Senators among them. About two-thirds of the way through the film, the grumbling began, with people walking out. Some politicians were so enraged by how they were being portrayed in the film, they actually shouted at the screen. At a party afterward, a drunken newspaper editor took a wild swing at Frank Capra for including a drunken reporter as one of the characters!

The wonderfully-acted, absorbing and human film was popular at the box-office and critically successful too. However, the film caused some controversy and pressure was brought to bear to hinder its release (two months after the outbreak of WWII in Europe), due to the fact that Capra's film was propagandistic, depicted political corruption, and appeared to paint an anti-democratic picture of the US government and its inner workings. But the film also called for faith in traditional American values of patriotism and faith in the people, and provided an educational lesson in how bills are passed through Congress.

Blu-ray Video Quality  SONY has done a beautiful 4K remastering of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.  The film has a nice crisp and sharp look to it.  Its not overly sharp and some of the close ups, do have a nice intended softness to them because of the lighting.  Fabric, patterns and surfaces all display a wonderful amount of detail.  This 75 year old classic has found a fountain of youth in this luscious and gorgeous transfer. Blacks are deep and rich in appearance here.  No disguising or masking of detail.  No crushing noticed.  Detail on dark items is still pretty solid. Flesh tones have a nice consistent tone to them.  Facial features are adequate and pretty impressive.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The excellent English 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio was harvested primarily from Frank Capra's personal nitrate print, which was struck from the original camera negative in 1939. The result is a soundtrack which is crystal-clear and free of age-related anomalies. There are some impressive and impactful effects captured here such as the gavel hitting and some of the crowd cheering and horns honking.  Some sound effects leave a little to be desired, but due to the age of this track and keeping it intact there isn't much more you can do here.  The whole presentation really engaged and impressed me. The music score by the great Dimitri Tiomkin is given as pleasing a soundstage as possible.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Frank Capra, Jr.: With is audio commentary we get a nice introduction by Frank Capra, Jr. and informs us that when he was four and half years old, that he also had a little brother slightly younger named Johnny and remembers one big night when his Father was at an International Press Preview of You Cant Take It With You at Columbia Pictures, but sadly Frank Capra had to be called away as his son Johnny was in hospital having his tonsils out, but sadly passed away and of course the whole family was devastated, but Frank Capra felt it was best to get back to work, as life has to carry on. On his search for a project, he came across a draft for a film on Fredrick Chopin, but Columbia Pictures felt it was too expensive and it was musical, but luckily Frank came across a two page synopsis entitled The Gentleman From Montana which Frank thought was fantastic and eventually got turned into the classic film Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, about an nave senator who goes to Washington and immediately thought of the actor Jimmy Stewart, plus all the other actors and of course the rest is history. We find out Frank Capra hated screen tests and preferred to talk to the actors personally and was very instinctual whether that person would be good for the film. When you see Jinny Stewart visiting all the monument buildings in Washington, it was all filmed without a permit and when the guards thought they had gone in one direction, they then quickly rushed in the opposite direction, got everything out of the van quickly, done a quick set up, shot the footage and then went onto another location in Washington and despite the restrictions, Frank Capra, Jr. feels the images you see, turned out superbly and the shot of the Liberty Bell, of course inspired to be named for Frank Capras Film Company. When the film was eventually shown to all the Washington Senators of the time, they hated it and felt the film was an insult on the integrity and reputation, but of course the public loved the film, but even more insult was to follow when the film was shown to the Senator from Montana and his family, they walked out in disgust. As to the music score, Frank Capra, Jr. informs us that Frank Capra wanted Dimitri Tiomkin, a Russian immigrant, which he also worked on the Frank Capra film Lost Horizon. But the musical score for Mr. Smith Goes To Washington he wanted a 100% Americana flavour. But also very important, we get informed that when we see an actor shed tears, Frank Capra wanted the audience to shed tears. But as we get near to the end of the film, Frank Capra, Jr. reads out a telegram that was sent from a correspondence in France before the Germans in World War II banned American Films, wrote, Cheers and accumulation! On the speech by the young senator on mans right and dignity, it was as though the joys, suffering, love, hatred, hopes and wishes of an entire people who value freedom above everything, found expression for the last time. Which about sums up what I felt about this film, how Frank Capra produced something really superb and honest, that lasts for a generation in bringing joy and happiness for all who view Frank Capra films. But this again is a fantastic audio commentary by the superb Frank Capra, Jr. and makes you even more appreciate Frank Capras films. By the way I meant to mention earlier, that all interior shots in the film, especially the Senate Chamber and the actual desks, were actually reconstructed in the Columbia Pictures film lot. So to sum up, this is a totally awesome audio commentary and Frank Capra, Jr. informs us of a lot more other interesting facts on the making of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and get a definite 5 star rating and is a definite must view audio.

Special Feature: Frank Capra, Jr. Remembers . . . Mr. Smith Goes To Washington [1999] [480i] [4:3] [11:50] With the start of this special feature, we get introduced to Frank Capra, Jr. [Producer] and informs us that this film was very ambitious film project, especially for Columbia Pictures, especially as it had a very limited budget. We hear that Frank Capra was attracted to this project because of its political stance and in 1938/39 it was the beginning of World War II, especially in Europe, and the film depicted freedom and democracy, as well as the most important political elements, but Frank Capra felt democracy was being taken away. Frank Capra respected and loved all actors, especially Jean Arthur, who was his favourite and he was the one that discovered her and knew Jean Arthur was going to be a big star. Frank Capra also felt the ending of the film was just right, especially showing the corrupt politician getting their comeuppance, and the film has eventually a happy ending, but there is a price to pay for the outcome. This is a really nice little feature and well worth a view.

Special Feature: Conversation with Frank Capra, Jr.: The Golden Years [2006] [1080i] [16:9] [17:52] Frank Capra, Jr. informs us that people and especially Frank Capra thought that 1939 was the greatest time for movies and especially Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, as well as Gone With The Wind and The Wizard of Oz, despite that at the time there was a depression in America especially. Frank Capra believed in the goodness of people, but he also believed that people could also be lead astray, and also films also show human emotions, that are still viewable today. After Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, his latter films were not so successful, even though they had a lot of comedy and pathos. But Frank Capra is the only director who had a string of hits, compared to other directors of the time. Once again this is a very nice extra, so please give it a view.

Special Feature: Frank Capra: Collaboration [2006] [1080p] [16:9] [19:18] Here we get another intimate view on Frank Capra the director and to start off this special we get the contribution from Richard Pea [Associate Professor of Film at Columbia University] and tells us that Frank Capra and the American Cinema, was a very popular director, whereas the likes of Orson Welles and Chaplin, were also directors, but they also acted in their films. We also get other views from other contributors from the likes of Jeanine Basinger [Curator of the Frank Capra Archives at Wesleyan University]; Kenneth Bowser [Producer/Director] and Frank Capra, Jr. [Producer]. But as the title of this special, is the word Collaboration and you find out there were certain people that Frank Capra liked to have behind his team, and they were Robert Riskin, who shaped Frank Capra view of films, plus Joe Walker, a cameraman who was of the inner circle of Columbia Pictures, but when Joe Walker worked on Frank Capras first film, Joe Walker did not like what he filmed, because he felt Frank Capra was too opinionated, but when Joe Walker viewed the film, he realised Frank Capra was a brilliant director and knew what he was doing and stayed the course on Frank Capras roster. We also get informed that Frank Capra was hands on with all the actors that appeared in his films and in turn the actors really love Frank Capra, as he treated the actors with respect and of course as mentioned before, he really loved Jean Arthur as an actress and in turn got the best performance out of her. One really fascinating information we hear about and that is Frank Capra liked to go the Preview screenings and sit at the back of the cinema with a tape recorder and record the whole screening, including the audiences reaction to the film, especially where the laughter was or not or where they were reacting, so that he could make cuts to the film, so it would run smoother when it went on general release. So all in all, this is a fascinating look at Frank Capra and why he became the most popular director of the time and again this is a well worth view.

Special Feature: Conversation with Frank Capra, Jr.: A Family History [2006] [1080i] [16:9] [25:55] Once again Frank Capra, Jr. gives us more personal view on the life and times of his father Frank Capra and that the start of this special we find out his father emigrated to America and he was only six years old in 1903, plus he also had a sister who was younger than him, and a couple of older sisters and an older brother and no one could speak any English, as the family originally came from Sicily in Italy and eventually ended up in California, where they lived with a Community of Italians, until his Father got killed and they lost their home. But when Frank Capra made his first film, he took his Mother to the Premiere, but after the screening Frank asked his Mother what she thought of the film, she said, it was okay, but when you going to get a proper job. But when he was down on his luck, he met this Shakespearian actor, who wanted to make a silent film, but the actor didn't know he was not a director. Anyway the film was made and the Executives loved the film, but sadly it was not a success and came clean and informed the actor he was not a famous director, but he told Frank Capra he knew his secret, despite this they went onto to make about 10 more films. Eventually he got a great break and ended up at Columbia Pictures and it was the start of his prolific career in the movie business, as he learnt all aspects of the film industry. But as Frank Capra, Jr. grew up in the shadow of his Fathers career and especially able to visit the film sets, especially for Its A Wonderful Life and the day he viewed the film being shot, it was the hottest day of the year, even though when you view the film, you think it is the height of winter, especially with the heavy snowfall and he thought it was a totally magical experience and his Father gave his some words of wisdom, he says,  what I produce is magic. Once again this is another fascinating view pf the life and times of Frank Capra and well worth a view.

Special Feature: The Frank Capra I Knew by Jeanine Basinger [2006] [1080p] [16:9] [13:04] Jeanine Basinger first met Frank Capra in the 1960s and it was at an event at Yale University where Jeanine Basinger was student, and Frank Capra was invited to do a presentation and from then onwards they both became very close and good friends. But at the presentation was also Jean Arthur as a guest, who sadly was very reclusive and not very comfortable with crowds, but when she saw Frank, she was really relaxed and enjoyed the presentation. Because Jeanine Basinger was the Trustee of the American Film Institute and was also on the Committee and also helped to select Frank Capra for a Lifetime Award, and so Frank Capra asked Jeanine Basinger to become his curator of his papers and also became involved in the life and times of Frank Capra and was also up close and personal to all of Frank Capras family. One fascinating fact is that Frank Capra saved all the correspondence he received and especially from his loyal fans, who he totally appreciated, as without them, his films would not of gained the success they did. When America entered World War II, Frank Capra realised there was no American Administration, so Frank took control, as he thought he was totally ideal for the job and a good job he did, as it would not be as it is today. Jeanine Basinger pulls out all the stops informing us why Frank Capra was such a success and says that he came along in history at the right moment, especially when there was an emerging art form in the film industry, and was on hand for creative storytelling, sensitive entertainment art form, but was very scientific, as well as very technical and grounded in machines and the cutting process and again Frank Capra was the ideal man, especially being around at the right place at the right time to be a star, as he had a very sharp and analytical brain. So all in all Jeanine Basinger is totally delightful and makes you feel that Frank Capra was a totally fascinating intelligent man and someone you felt you would have loved to have been a good friend to know personally, and especially knowing Frank Capra the brilliant filmmaker.

Special Feature-Length Documentary: Frank Capras American Dream which is Hosted and Narrated by Ron Howard [1997] [1080p] [4:3] [109 minutes] This beloved film artist was driven as much by self-doubt as by his belief in the power of the little man. Documentary focusing on the life and film production of Frank Capra revealing an artist whose arrogant manner won the loyalty of several collaborators, producing films that conveyed an enduring vision of what America aspired to be.

Before the special starts, we get a very prophetic comment from John Cassavetes, when he says, Maybe there really wasn't an America, maybe it was only Frank Capra. From then onwards Ron Howard introduces himself facing the camera and takes centre stage on the awesome career of the artist director Frank Capra. Here we find out the man was quintessential in bringing to the silver screen the American Dream, especially with his hugely successful films between the 1930s and the 1940s, in painting a portrait of America that was decent, honest and willing to stand up and fight for what it believed in. But we also find out that Frank Capra was very brash, cocky and arrogant, but he was equally generous, deeply sentimental, and was racked with self-doubt and for a quarter of a century in his adopted country, was a perfect reflection on each other. But of course Ron Howard does not stand centre stage, as we get other contributions from the likes of Martin Scorsese [Director]; John Milius [Writer/Director]; Robert Altman [Director]; Michael Keaton [Actor]; Richard Dreyfuss [Actor]; Angela Lansbury [Actress]; Garry Marshall [Writer/Director]; Marshall Herskovitz [Director]; Bill Duke [Actor/Director]; Richard Schickel [Film Critic]; Oliver Stone [Writer/Director]; Frank Capra, Jr. [Producer]; Tom Capra [Producer]; Joseph McBride [Frank Capra Biographer]; Bob Thomas [Harry Cohn Biographer]; Allen Daviau [Cinematographer]; Jeanine Basinger [Curator of Capra Archives, Wesleyan University]; Andre De Toth [Director]; Edward Bernds [Sound Technician/Director]; Peter Falk [Actor]; Fay Ray [Actress]; Amy Heckerling [Writer/Director]; Edward Zwick [Director]; Arthur Hiller [Director] and Jayne Wyatt [Actress]. With all these contributors with this special documentary, they tell us why they loved Frank Capra the director.

As we delve deeper into the life and times of Frank Capra, we find out that in his early days he was determined to get a proper education, plus he did loads of part time jobs to make money and that way he met characters on his journey into life, that were eventually portrayed in his films, that also helped to determine his career in the movie business. But with a stroke of luck met someone that kicked start his career as a director, where he also learned all aspect of how the film industry worked and especially editing film, that eventually helped him get a job with Columbia Pictures., where it brought him a glittering career and deservedly won him several Academy Awards but some of films were not a success and he used to get very depressed. But after a lean period, he started to get greater fame in films that the American public loved, especially in directing Mr. Smith Goes To Washington but after this film he felt it was time to move on and went into partnership with directors George Stevens and William Weiller and created a new company entitled Liberty Films and their first project was Its A Wonderful Life, which was started in May 1946, and of course was a critical success and won Five Academy Awards but despite these plaudits, it was not a financial success with the public at large, and faded away, but of course it gained cult classic success over many years it was broadcast on American Television, especially every year at Christmas time. But despite this, his fortunes went into decline and went out of favour with the general public and even more humiliation had to sell Liberty Films to Paramount Pictures, but at the same time he was accused of being a communist sympathiser, but was never charged. But eventually he got signed up with Paramount Pictures as a contract director and his first film was Riding High which was followed by Here Comes The Groom. Eventually Frank Capra was exhausted, especially with World War II and losing Liberty Films decided to take some time off and to become a gentleman farmer, bit over time got bored and eventually found a job at NBC Television and worked on a TV programme entitled MEMO  The Magnificent which was a cartoon series about the Bell Telephone system, as he loved educating people. But eventually made his way back to directing films and his first venture was A Hole In The Head starring Frank Sinatra, but felt frustrated and tried once again to make a success in films, and did a modern remake of his original Lady For A day which was entitled Pocketful of Miracles and a really terrible experience, that was produced by Glenn Ford, who totally interfered in the making of the film, which in turned negative for him and got very depressed and eventually turned his back on the film industry he so loved and turned to become an author and produced his autobiography entitled Frank Capra  The Name Above The Title, which  in turn made him even more popular with the public and was invited to all the Universities in the United States of America and the best thing to ever happen to him, as the students loved his films and wanted to hear all about his experiences in directing films. But despite his renewed success, he sadly passed away in his sleep on the 3rd September, 1991 at the age of 94 and was buried next to his wife Lou in California. So to sum up, this is a totally fascinating and insightful special documentary and especially hearing all about the life and times of Frank Capra, who was a very intelligent and fascinating person and can sum up that this is a very professional uplifting produced documentary and a definite watch and gests a 5 star rating from me.

Theatrical Trailer [1939] [480i] [4:3] [1:42] With this particular trailer, you get an endorsement by the World Famous Commentator H.V. Kallenborn, who of course appears in the film when Mr. Smith does his filibuster in the Senate.

International Trailer [1939] [480i] [4:3] [3:55] This International Textless Trailer, includes rare footage that is not in the final release version, including that of Jefferson Smith in a parade in his hometown.

Finally, any serious collector or person that claims themselves as a film buff should have this film in their Blu-ray collection. Theres an absolute treasure trove and abundance of extras that chronicle the production of the film and life and career of its director. SONY has taken good care and presented absolute perfection in restoring this with and incredible presentation in both video and audio.  Its somewhat a relief to see a classic film like is getting the treatment it deserves. SONY, who should be applauded and has outdone themselves and produced one of THE BEST Blu-ray releases of the 21st Century. Highly Recommended!

887782,5,6304481691,"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, 1939 film

A United States Senator has died and the Governor must appoint a replacement to get the approval of a dam in the state. [Water supplies, or power, are very important in western states.] Politicians have been buying up the lands near the proposed dam. [""Honest graft"" said George Washington Plunkett.] The film shows the back-room deals of the political bosses. But the Governor's children clamor for Jefferson Smith (showing the effects of the media on impressionable minds). Candidate selection by luck? The Governor explains his logic: a young fresh face will impress the voters [and the machine will do the job of getting him elected]. Smith is a fast learner, he knows how to flatter the powerful Senator Paine. Smith's father was murdered by a mining corporation (but they couldn't prove it). Arriving in Washington he is greeted by lovely young women (""groupies"", a hint of scandal). Smith visits the Federal monuments and buildings. Smith is so naive you know it is just an act. His pet idea is a ""Boy's Camp"" for city boys. The film shows how the media can play the news in its photographs of Senator Smith.

The Senate commences with a prayer for wisdom. [Have they ever prayed for honesty and common sense?] Smith punches out the newspaper men who offended him [but they were just doing their job, following orders]. These journalists tell Smith how they see things. Senator Price explains how the laws are made; even a lawyer can't understand them. Secretary Saunders explains how bills are made into laws. [This is a tutorial for the people who forgot their civics courses.] Smith's camp would be located by Willett Creek (where the dam would be built). Smith's speech is played for laughs, but the visitors cheer and clap for this well-meaning plan. Senator Paine's daughter Susan will divert Smith away from the Senate when the bill for the Willett Creek dam is introduced. [Could Smith be working for the interests of Big Coal who don't want competition from hydroelectric power?] A tipsy Clarissa Saunders explains how the trick was done. Could the Senate introduce a bill that benefits one rich man? [This film shows how political bosses control the politicians.]

Jim Taylor advises Senator Smith to do what is best for his state, where Taylor owns many businesses and newspapers. Senator Paine explains the need for ""compromise"", playing ball. The next day Senator Paine brings up the facts about Senator Smith: ownership of the Willett Creek lands! Expert witnesses testify as to the validity of Smith's signature. Shall government ""of the people, by the people, for the people"" perish from this earth? Clarissa Saunders returns to advise Jefferson Smith on how to fight his expulsion. Smith launches a filibuster to prevent this, and creates dramatic speeches. Senators protest by walking out, but a quorum call gets them back. Taylor orders the press to censor Smith's speech! [Can one wealthy individual still control the media in one state?] The other Senators agree to put down this upstart. One small weekly newspaper will print the truth, even when gangsters attack the newsboys. Will the people suffer from Taylor and his gang? Thousands of telegrams were sent against Smith; he collapsed from fatigue. But there is a surprise ending that ends happily.

Signing an option to buy land shows Smith is learning how government works. Building a dam would provide jobs and future hydroelectric power. It is a more sensible project than a reform school. This film swindles your emotions by presenting a one-sided and biased viewpoint.

This review is for the entire product I received from Amazon, which as part of the price, includes an UltraViolet download of the movie.  If you are after a ""Pure Movie Review"", I recommend the ""International Movie Database"".  There, you will find reviews unrelated to the delivery systems.

Over several days I spent 4-5 hours setting up multiple accounts with Sony, UltraViolet, and Flixter. I have reset passwords, submitted support tickets, and diligently followed various procedures and I still cannot watch anything through UltraViolet.  I enter my redemption code with UltraViolet and it is accepted. I enter the same code with Flixter and I get a variety of error messages.

I often purchase other movies that have an iTunes redemption code.  In 10 SECONDS, I can watch my movie on any iOS device with zero hassles.

Mr. Smith goes to Washington is a 5-star movie.  However, the decision of the studio to use UltraViolet massively detracts from the pleasure of this purchase.",1423267200,3,1028,5.035502958579881

888110,5,6304481691,"Frank Capra directed so many wonderful classic films over several decades, it might be difficult for most fans to pick his ""best."" But, with its timeless American values and skeptical look at political corruption in our nation's capital, just about everyone can relate to this movie. In fact, given the turbulent events in D.C. right now, in 2014, 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' clearly stands out, on its own and compared to all the other Capra classics.  Yes, it's my top pick among Capra's broad cinematic repertoire.

Technically, I think this Blu-ray package is a masterful achievement.  The film was cleaned up quite well, for its age, and presented in a beautiful, 4K-master production.  It is worth every penny I paid for it, and certainly at the Amazon discount.  The video and audio quality is top-notch, and the extras that the studio included in the ""Mr. Smith' package are a great addition.  I recommend this Blu-ray version without reservation.  It deserves every one of the five stars I gave it.",1419984000,10,1010,4.905882352941177

888157,5,6304481691,"""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is one of the great movies in the canon of American cinema. The downside of that is that a lot of copies have been made over the years, leaving the original camera negative in tatters. Film from poorly made dupes was spliced in where the original camera negative was destroyed entirely. The DVDs of this movie allowed a new generation of filmgoers to see this amazing movie, but the picture showed obvious signs of wear and tear.

For this Blu-Ray, Grover Crisp and his team at Sony Pictures went back to the original camera negative, scanned what is left in at 4K resolution, and meticulously restored it. For the parts that had been replaced with poorly made dupes, they searched for the best possible later generation film elements they could find, including Frank Capra's personal copy of the film, and scanned them in at 4K as well -- and restored them just as meticulously. They used the audio track from Frank Capra's personal print and employed all the latest tools to make it sound clear as a bell.

There are a few hiccups that even all of their hard work couldn't iron out, but this is still a miracle of a restoration. As presented on Blu-Ray, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" looks better than it has in decades, and probably sounds the best it ever has.",1418688000,9,1296,4.606060606060606
888158,5,6304481691,"Sony's Blu-Ray has to be the bargain of the year. A classic film, splendidly restored, housed in a superb digibook full of behind the scenes photos and all for $12.99. Very highly recomended.",1418688000,3,191,4.818181818181818

888163,5,6304481691,"Fans of Frank Capra have reason to celebrate with three of the directors films being released recently on Blu-ray in the last few weeks. Released this week by Sony in time for it's 75th Anniversary,  ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington""(1939) joins Criterion's ""It Happened One Night"" and Kino's ""Pocketful of Miracles"" in what can only be described as a spectacular Blu-ray that is one of the best of the year. Mastered in 4K with a Bitrate of 24.93, ""Mr. Smith"" has never looked better with a nearly pristine picture that should please fans of the film. Gone are the vertical lines, torn frames, dirt and white specks that marred the standard DVD versions of the film in the past and Sony has done an exceptional job in restoring the film to it's original condition. According to the liner notes by Grover Crisp in the included booklet, the restoration of ""Mr. Smith"" has been on-going since 1990 and was a challenge as ""the original negative suffered great damage through over-printing at the time of release"" but ""for this restoration as much as the original negative as possible was used"" instead of ""poorly made duplicates"". The results of that years long restoration by Sony are certainly impressive. Blacks, whites and grays are evenly balanced and some scenes are so crystal clear you can see the smallest details such as the white hairpiece and surrounding make-up on Claude Rains. Sony has showed the respect and care this great film deserves by presenting ""Mr. Smith"" in an attractive 24 page Digibook that is packed with information concerning the making of the film. Anyone viewing the film will certainly notice that things haven't changed all that much in our nation's capital after 75 years and may have gotten worse. The storyline of a naive and idealistic young Senator suddenly exposed to a cesspool of corruption by an institution he greatly admires stands up as well in today's cynical times as it did in 1939. The acting is top notch, with James Stewart giving one of the greatest performances of his long career. He gets great support from Jean Arthur, Thomas Mitchell, Claude Rains and Edward Arnold among the excellent cast. ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is 129 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.37:1) and contains the following subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese(Brazil), Japanese, Greek, Italian, Korean, Chinese(Mandarin) and Thai. The Audio(DTS-HD MA) is English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. There are a lot of Special Features including conversations with Frank Capra Jr. and a documentary on Frank Capra hosted by Ron Howard. ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is one of the greatest films ever made. Now that  Sony has honored it with their superb new Blu-ray presentation it should be an essential addition to every home film library and comes very highly recommened.",1417824000,18,2829,5.042735042735043

Take a look at this country through her eyes if you really want to see something. And you won't just see scenery; you'll see the whole parade of what Man's carved out for himself, after centuries of fighting."" Another great film from 1939, this Frank Capra classic is one of the greatest political dramas ever made...ranking #26 on AFI's ""100 Years, 100 Films"", with Jefferson Smith ranking the #11 hero on AFI's ""!00 Years, 100 Heroes"". Jean Arthur got lead billing as she was the biggest star at the time; but this is a Jimmy Stewart film and it made a big star our of him. Naive and idealistic Jefferson Smith (Stewart) is appointed on a lark by the spineless governor of his state. He is reunited with the state's senior senator--presidential hopeful and childhood hero, Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) In Washington, however, Smith discovers many of the shortcomings of the political process as his earnest goal of a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold). He is ably assisted by his secretary, Clarissa Saunders (Arthur). Capra's previous films, such as ""Mr Deeds Goes to Town"" and ""You Cant Take it With You"", had emphasized the decency of the common man; however this film is more pessimistic as the decent common man is surrounded by a venal, petty and thuggish group of crooked politicians. Nevertheless, Smiths filibuster and the tacit encouragement of the Senate President (Harry Carrey) are both emblematic of the director's belief in the difference that one individual can make. This theme would be expanded further in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and other films. In addition to the actors named, look for a star-studded array of the best character actors of the era.

He is in awe of Washington D.C., and of his fellow senator,  who was a good friend of his father's. In his innocence,  he believes that all of the politicians stand for the grand ideals that America was founded upon. He is suddenly faced with the full reality of the political machines at work (run by Mr. Taylor), and the power that a man with money can have.

888359,5,6304481691,"James Stewart and Frank Capra together!  If your only criteria for judging movies is how artistic they are, there's a whole bunch of great movies out there that the average mother wouldn't dream of letting their children take even a peek of...ever.  Movies like ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" though do more than just convey an intriguing message artistically, they try to change the world and turn it into something God intended it to be.  There actually aren't many movies I would give five stars to.  It's a pretty short list.  This one and ""Meet John Doe"" are way up at the top of it.

P.S. To the average sub-conciously suicidal movie critic out there who is in love with R-rated movies, just please consider one thing, when Capra and Stewart were making movies, our world was at its peak and growing.  We were alive.  We had a beautiful and thriving US culture.  R and X rated movies aren't a sign of what's next for us.  It is not a sign of our continued growth.  They are a sign that our culture is dying.",1408060800,2,1013,4.451086956521739

Wins: Writing Original Story.

March Boy awards: Picture, Director-Frank Capra, Leading Actor-James Stewart, Supporting Actor-Claude Rains and Screenplay Writing.

Mr. Smith goes to Washington relates the story of a boy scout leader named Jefferson Smith and his experiences in Washington when he is elected senator. He proposes a bill to purchase a piece of land to build a national Boy Scout organization and faces opposition from some crooked politicians who attempt to frame him for fraud. Luckily with the help and wisdom of his experienced secretary Clarissa Saunders he is able to create a filibuster for nearly a whole day to prevent the Senate from voting on the bill.

A thirty year old James Stewart sears the screen with his fiery, intense portrayal of the eager rookie senator who holds fast to the ideals of the Founders and believes that lost causes are the ones most worth fighting for. Claude Rains (Senator Joseph Paine) turns in an equally great performance as Jeffersons stabber-in-the-back friend. I haven't seen Thomas Mitchell in Stagecoach (the 1939 supporting actor winner) but Rains plays his part with such a strong sense of intelligence and sly wit I wish he didn't have to split votes with Harry Carey in that itsy-bitsy nothing role as the president of the senate. Jean Arthurs (Clarissa Saunders) voice is a little jarring but she plays her part well enough. Frank Capras direction is just flawless. He brings out the best in every single actor and his staging of the sequences are superb.

Deciding who deserved best picture and director that year (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington or Gone With the Wind) is like flipping a coin because it was such a strong year.

I also loved the many sights of Washington D.C. along with the very patriotic American score. The music gains even more power to me when I realize that it was composed by an immigrant!

888810,5,6304481691,"""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is often ranked among the best films of all time, for good reason.  It is a masterpiece of story, acting and direction.  Jimmy Stewart, in one of his best roles, is a young idealistic man who comes to the attention of a state for his selfless actions supporting Boy Scouts.  When the State Political Machine needs to replace a senator, they decide to choose the naive Mr. Smith because they think he can be manipulated easily.  When he realizes what is happening, he puts up an epic political and publicity fight against the powerful and corrupt Machine, building to a classic scene of a filibuster on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

Jimmy Stewart puts in a masterful performance, showing why he was one of the greatest Hollywood stars of all time.  Watch for the scene where he keeps fumbling his hat when the infatuated young Mr. Smith meets the Senator's daughter -- one of the best bits of subtle physical comedy ever put on film.  The supporting cast is great, and Frank Capra (who also directed my single favorite movie, ""It's a Wonderful Life"") provides direction that showcases the great performances.  The direction tells the story, cleanly and simply.  Underneath it all, an honest, pure patriotism is the foundation for the film. Yes, it is a little old-fashioned, but that is part of what makes it great.

Not only does this movie provide great entertainment, it also teaches about how aspects of the Senate work.  It shows how Government DOES work versus how it SHOULD work.  It is both inspiring and discouraging.  This movie should be seen by every teenager at least once.  It should then be seen by every politician every year to remind him or her of what a public servant should be.",1382659200,,1729,4.700996677740863

888872,5,6304481691,"""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is, simply put, one of the greatest films of all time. From the directing of Frank Capra to the inspirational performance by a young James Stewart to a story that is as relevant today as it was when the movie first came out more than seven decades ago, this film is superb. As I write this the day after our federal government has again narrowly avoided a meltdown fueled by self-centered politicians on all sides, I am reminded of how much has changed and yet how much remains the same as it was during the last days of the Great Depression.

Like today, in the movie we have the corrupt politicians, exemplified by Joseph Paine, and the power-hungry party bosses, such as Jim Taylor, both of whom try to thwart the attempt by Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) to introduce a bill to use land in his home state for a boys' camp. (The proposed camp happens to be on a tract that these two politicians hope to use for their own financial advantage.) Seemingly standing alone against this corruption, Mr. Smith, a mid-term replacement for a senator who has died, conducts a one-man filibuster, one that ultimately succeeds and thwarts the plans of Paine and Taylor.

Filmed at a time before politicians played to the ever-present media with the thirty-second soundbite, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" effectively portrays not just the seamy side of politics, but also the truly noble character of those who are willing to risk all for what they believe is right, even if they must do so against all odds. Would that we had more Mr. Smiths in Washington today.",1381968000,,1586,4.681003584229391

It's also notable that Capra is from Italy where many directors paint the movie screen with great emotional depth.  Combined with Stuart's all-American patriotism, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a moving piece of art.  The final scenes, and some in between, are tear worthy.",1381622400,,525,5.117647058823529

888980,4,6304481691,"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington(released Oct/39)stars,among others,Jean Arthur,James Stewart,Claude Rains and Edward Arnold. Nominated for an outstanding 11 times,it only won one OSCAR in the writing category. 1939 was a great year for film making,so it is not too hard to imagine why it did not win more.
The story finds Stewart/Smith as a down home boy who finds himself suddenly taking over the senate seat in his state,after its occupant decides to kick the bucket. Soft spoken,but as honest as Abe Lincoln,Stewart meekly and humbly accepts the position. Unbeknownst to him,the people behind the appointment are a group of corrupt and hardened politicians led by Arnold. One of the members of the group is Rains who also has been kept a Senate seat in order to push through graft after graft. Rains was a former friend of Stewarts father and Stewart has very high regard for him.
Once in Washington Stewart is given a secretary(Arthur)who soon learns that this naive young man is in for the ride of his life,in the rough and tumble political world there. Stewart is awestruck at the look and feel of Washington,with its' innumerable monuments to politicians long gone and to the hallowed words written there. Back in his office Stewart is chomping at the bit to get going but doesn't know where the gas pedal is. He consults his friend Rains,who suggests he introduce Stewarts idea as a bill,to start up a boys camp in his state. With Arthur's help this is exactly what he does,even though Arthur warns him of the numerous hurtles he will encounter.
When the corrupt bunch of politicos find out that the camp Stewart wants to create lies smack dab on the property that they have been planning to build a dam on,they jump into action. Rains is reluctantly pressured to come down hard by Arnold,who starts a vigourous smear campaign back home against Stewart.
Meanwhile Stewart has started to get an awful taste of how things really work,and he doesn't like it,nor does he know what to do. When his good friend Rains stands up in Congress and tells the floor that Smith is corrupt and should be removed from office,it's a gut wrenching blow. Arthur has temporarily fled Washington and quit her job. She decides to come back and help the lug get his ideals and kahonies back. Stewart decides to stand and fight for what he knows is right. He starts a filibuster in the Senate and for 24 hours tries to tell everyone present exactly what has been going on. Near the end Stewart briefly succumbs to a fainting spell,from exhaustion. Rains re enters the chambers and is allowed to bring in sacks full of letters from supposedly outraged voters in the state. Stewart knows they're all lies,and when he comes to he approaches Rains calmly and appeals to his decency one more time,his voice almost gone. Rains leaves the floor temporarily and a shot rings out soon after. Rains tried to shoot himself but was stopped. He re enters the floor and finally tells the truth to everyone,that it should be him shunned,not Stewart. That is where the film ends. That's one for the good guy.
This is the part that has always got me about the film. It ends too abruptly,as if someone in the editing room suddenly decided that it was time to go for lunch,and hurriedly snipped the frames together as is and left. There are two ways of looking at it,I suppose. One,is that the film continues on and shows a triumphant return of Stewart to his hometown and his proposal of marriage to Arthur,or two,leave them wanting more. Capra,et al,chose the latter. I'm sorry,but I have always thought the film screamed for more.
This film also has a cast of supporting players the likes of which you rarely see together,folks like HB Warner,Guy Kibbee,Thomas Mitchell,Eugene Pallette,Beulah Bondi,Ruth Donnelly,William Demerest,Jack Carson and many,many more. The film was made before the opening of WW2 and the sentiments it speaks of such as life,liberty and freedom of speech,was a kind of shout out to the world at large. So when WW2 broke out about a month before its release,it was ever the more meaningful.
Technically speaking this print is in its original a/r and I must say it needs a clean up. The opening credits tells us the film was restored by the Library of Congress,along with the help of other film institutions. That is all well and good if the film looked like it had been restored to a more acceptable level. The first reel is the most affected,with film deterioration and other defects front and center. Extras include commentary and an interview with Frank Capra Jr.,an advert gallery and the original trailer. Speaking of the latter,you will notice a parade sequence in there that isn't in the film. I can't help but speculate whether that was filmed as part of another ending,maybe Stewart's hometown return,as I would have preferred to have seen? Just wondering.
All in all this film still packs a major punch as a political noob goes up against the staid and corrupt state and Washington politics. Stewart does a bang up job and is ably supported all around by a great cast. But that ending.......",1375660800,,5091,4.792946530147895

Furthermore, despite its age it acts as a timeless reminder of the evils of political machines. It makes us root for the underdog who always seems to overcome whatever the opposition and it is distinctively American. It had a wonderful director in Frank Capra and a wonderful supporting cast including Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, and Thomas Mitchell who make the story all the more relatable . In one of his best performances, Jimmy Stewart is an idealistic, naive boy's troop leader named Jefferson Smith. Believing he will be a pawn, a powerful man gets Smith a seat in the nation's Senate. However although he is out of place the patriotic Smith does his best to be worthy of his position. His actions soon find him face to face with the political machine that elected him. With all odds and seemingly everyone against him, Smith makes one last monumental effort. With the help of his secretary (Jean Arthur), Smith fights to plead his case through a filibuster. Fatigued by so many hours of talking, Smith finally collapses but not before effectively succeeding at his task.

What made Frank Capra's films so powerful? Not the cinematography. Not the outstanding effects. Nothing really spectacular. Capra grasped the heart of real life and plunked it down on film for everyone to observe. He stimulated our souls.

Anyhow, what gripped me more than anything about this 1930s film is that, unfortunately, the James Taylors and political machines of yesteryear are alive and flourishing more than 70 years later. I guess they always will be.

Every time that our representatives in Washington can watch little children being riddled into bloody pulp by bullets, and yet fight against gun reform -- you can bet that they are in the pocket of the mighty billion-dollar-a-year gun industry. The blood of every innocent that dies at the hands of ruthless gunslingers is also on the hands of the politicians who refuse to do anything to curtail deadly weapon distribution. Why do they fight against gun reform? They're bought representatives. You can bank on it.

Every time that our representatives in Washington vote down increased taxes for the rich, while increasing the taxes for the middle class and cutting programs for the poor -- you can bet that those representatives are in the pocket of some rich supporter. They're some fat cats' toadies. Political prostitutes.

And just like James Taylor, the rich industries and people of today will stop at nothing to keep the money flowing. All I can say is what someone asked about two thousand years ago -- what does it profit people if they gain the whole world but lose their own eternal souls?

But remember, the one way that every law-abiding United States adult is created equal is in the voting booth. Because, whether you are rich or poor -- every adult citizen is given just one vote. At the voting booth, the rich and poor are equally endowed. Don't forget your power in the booth.

The other senator dies, and he is appointed by the governor to be a docile puppet in the senate.

But he's no docile puppet. He's an idealist who takes the advice (and of course falls in love with) his secretary, formerly the secretary of the dead senator. She suggests he introduce a bill more for an exercise in how the senate runs than for any other reason. So he proposes a national boys' camp on Willow Creek in his home state (never named). Problem is, the political machine of his state has Willow Creek figured for a pork-barrel dam-building scheme to make a lot of money for a lot of crooked people.

The highlight of the movie is Smith's filibuster, which is a brilliant piece of acting, but which distracted me with the issue no one has ever answered regarding filibustering: what about going to the bathroom? How could anyone stay on his feet for nearly 24 hours and never have to take a potty break?

Years later, I bought myself a copy of this film and it is one of my classic treasures.  The disc doesn't carry many Extra Features, but what it does have are brilliant.  You've got a commentary by Frank Capra, Jr., a biography or rather reminiscing of his work on this film, a vintage advertising gallery, and the original trailer.  Of course you've also got the usual audio and foreign language features as well.

As to the film...
Filmed in an era where one couldn't rely on special effects and gimmicks to hide weak acting or storytelling, the cast and crew really pulled all the stops.  The narrative is strong and well paced.  The film's plot is fairly simple (I will still not do plot spoilers), but they used that to their advantage...while making the characters shine.  Each has a distinct and vibrant character that simply charms you.  Even the villains have have a unique and sinister sparkle.  Also, they really do a good job in accurately portraying Senate practice and procedure.  This may be a fictional film, but it is fiction based on fact and really turn these ""basic"" procedures into some of the strongest drama I've ever seen.  There is also no real bias portrayed except for a desire to remember a greater and truer America.  No one is really spared criticism in this film.  Media, Corporations, Government, the populace...no one is spared haha.

All in all, this is a truly inspirational film for all ages.  It really captures the old American Courage & Spirit that should be the real pride of the United States.  The storytelling is compelling and very symbolic.  Characters are well acted and believable...albeit harken back to the simple heroics people should strive for in life.  No fluff, no gimmicks, just raw filming and acting talent.  It is a very sentimental work.  This is a good reminder of hope in a day of angry political conflicts and some underhanded corruptions.

The acting is great as well. The vice-president, for example, did an exceptional job as being a sympathetic figure. So did the main reporter character.

One thing I'll comment -- Capra chose to avoid identifying the state and parties involved. I think that was wise, because he was trying to show the problem of corruption, which can (and has) occurred in both major parties or in any state.",1327708800,2,650,4.692982456140351

An innocent, small town boy is suddenly elevated to United States senator and single handedly takes on the crookedness of Washington.  We are led to believe that every single senator, except Smith, is on the take.  Granted, there is perfidy in government, but I would suggest that one orphan newbie senator is not going to make much difference, especially one going about it as Smith does.

Jimmy Stewart bumbles around, as was his usual acting style.  The big comedy bit is that he runs into furniture and keeps dropping his hat.  I wasn't much amused.  But Smith is honest, adores Lincoln, yet knows little of how government works.  He relies on his inherited secretary, Jean Arthur, for the details.  She even coaches him from the senate gallery when he appears to stumble in his attack.

We do not know what state he represents.  It's 1939 so FDR is president, but that is not mentioned.  We do not know whether Smith is a Republican or a Democrat.  In fact, this whole tale takes place in a vacuum.  The cast is a who's who of character actors.  There's a nice tour of the monuments and a tip of the hat to patriotism, flag waving, and religion, but the parts are not hooked together.  We are led to believe, however, that a good sock in the jaw is what is needed for teaching the wastrels; Smith popped several media dregs and he wasn't so much as punished for battery as given a lecture from the police.  This same false lesson was taught in the same director's movie ""Mr. Deeds Goes To Town.""  N.B. Fisticuffs are not recommended as a solution to political differences.

889619,5,6304481691,"It is hard to believe but it has now been more than 70 years since the release of Frank Capra's masterpiece ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"".  This 1939 gem boasts an all-star cast featuring Jimmy Stewart as the rather nave and avuncular Senator Jefferson Smith and one of my all-time favorite actresses Jean Arthur in the role of Senator Smith's feisty Chief of Staff Clarissa Saunders.  The all-star cast also includes Claude Rains as Senator Joseph Harrison Paine and Edward Arnold as the ruthless party boss Jim Taylor.  This is a timeless classic that speaks to us just as powerfully in 2011 as it did to audiences way back in 1939.  A screening of ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" should be mandatory for all members of Congress at the beginning of each two year session.

Now if you know anything at all about civics you understand that the Founding Fathers envisioned a Congress populated by citizen legislators.  The idea was that serving in the Congress would be an honor bestowed on an individual by his fellow citizens.  A person would go to Washington, serve a term or two or three, then return to his home town and go back to work.  Jefferson Smith was just such an individual.  As head of the Boy Rangers in his state Jefferson Smith was totally apolitical.  When he was appointed by the Governor to fulfill the remaining term of a recently deceased U.S. Senator Jefferson Smith was totally taken aback.  Although he did not fully understand why he was chosen he was more than willing to do his civic duty and serve.  Being from an unidentified Western state Jefferson Smith was totally unprepared for the kind of corruption that he would encounter in our nation's capitol.  When he arrived in Washington he seemed like a fish out of water.  This was an honest and sincere man who was simply overwhelmed by the history and the institutions of Washington D.C.  His naivete was on display for all to see.  Most thought him a buffoon who would play right into their hands.  His Chief of Staff Clarissa Saunders wanted to quit.  But when all was said and done the politicos in Washington had no idea how to deal with an honest man like Jeff Smith.  And that is what ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" is really all about.

When Jefferson Smith arrives in Washington he is taken under the wing of the senior senator from his state Joseph Harrison Paine.  Paine is a corrupt career politician who mistakenly believes that he can control his young colleague.  But when a shady land deal sponsored by Paine is up for consideration Senator Smith begins to ask questions.....lots of very good questions.  Suddenly a deal that was thought to be a slam dunk is in great jeopardy.  There are powerful interests involved and millions of dollars at stake.  Senator Paine and his allies in the Senate decide that Senator Smith must be stopped at any cost.  And so they initiate an intensive campaign to discredit him.  Through it all the good Senator Smith perseveres cheered on by his Chief of Staff Saunders who has come around to his way of thinking.  That memorable scene where Smith filibusters for hours until he is hoarse features a memorable performance by the veteran supporting actor Harry Carey as President of the Senate.

Because this film was made in 1939 many may believe that ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" is corny and somewhat dated.  Think again.  The values of honesty, decency, hard work and perseverance displayed by our hero are just as valid today as they were back in 1939.  Aren't these the values we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren?  Furthermore, this is an exceptionally well-made motion picture.  The screen play is crisp and the acting outstanding by just about everyone involved.  And as you might expect producer/director Frank Capra does a marvelous job in pulling it all together.  ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" was nominated for 11 Academy Awards back in 1939 and I believe is still a film that can be enjoyed by the entire family.  Very highly recommended!",1294185600,2,4002,4.73121387283237

You know James Stewart is above even his own stellar orbit when he warns us ""I'll be speaking too fast for ya!""  The cast and pacing are terrific. We root for Smith, we root for Capra, we root for an America capable of celebrating the ideals of honor and decency in public service.

Perhaps because this film is the summation of everything Capra stood for, anything less than perfection is a letdown.  And there are small annoyances in the story line that stand out like specks in the Hope Diamond.  Why, for instance, if Smith is so well versed in American history, does Saunders have to spell out the ABCs of a bicameral congress for him? (I know that's for our benefit, but it could have been set up differently.) And while we're on the topic, why are senators introducing appropriations bills (the dam and boys ranch)that traditionally start in the House of Representatives? Or, for that matter, if Smith is really looking for a loan for a private organization, rather than an appropriation, why not celebrate free enterprise by visiting a local bank? And when Paine and Taylor discover Smith is eyeing the property they've targeted for their nefarious dam, why not offer him their full support for a DIFFERENT location--there's no reason why the ranch must be on that particular spot!

Finally, as many reviewers have noted, the ending is deus ex machina big-time! I'd hoped the scouts were going to save the day--maybe uncover the scoundrel who forged the signature.

889666,5,6304481691,"Jimmy Stewart, Claude Rains, Jean Arthur and a whole great cast played great in this political comedy by Frank Capra.

The 1938 Congress was not too happy about this film, despite it's nomination for several Academy awards for that year.

Jim Taylor runs the ship in his state.  Even the governor follows orders from him.  And so does the senator from his state, Joe Paine (played by Claude Rains).  Another senator who was in Taylor's pocket unexpectedly dies when Taylor wants this bill go to through from which graft both he and Paine was handsomely profit.

Through mere chance (a flipped coin lands on its edge -- typical Capra) Mr. Smith is made the junior senator from the state.  Smith is naive, young and captivated by Washington.

He soon learns that Washington is more than platitudes and large monuments.  The town can break you mercilessly.  The film is about the common man and his fight against Washington bureaucracy and corruption.  What can one man do?

The movie too was a race between the people getting what Smith was saying and when Paine's conscience would crack!

The films poignant moments when the Boys Press, run by Smith's mother, try to get the word out that Smith is telling the truth, and yet the graft machine is slapping kids around and smashing their wagons with big trucks that things start getting dark and hairy.

Great performances by Jean Arthur as the wise-cracking secretary Saunders who eventually falls for Smith, who at first gives up his idealism with a plea for sanity in Congress.

Yeah, well, we're still waiting for that one!

This film was restored -- you have to get the 2008 DVD restoration version.  A must-see for those who are major cynical about this country and what it stands for.  One man can do something about it.  We all can.

Capra's later films including It's A Wonderful Life in the mid 1940s also played out this theme of the common man versus the selfish political machines.  A must-watch!

889668,5,6304481691,"i finally got around to seeing Mr. Smith goes to Washington (i bought the movie over a year ago) and i'm glad i did. The film is one of the finest ever and was miles ahead of it's time (1939).

An empty Senatorial seat has become available after the death of the incumbent Senator, and the Governor of the state is battling the Taylor political machine for the appointment. After not going over well in his state with his alleged first pick, the Governor is confronted by his kids during dinner about picking the leader of the Boy Rangers (kinda like today's boy scouts), Jefferson Smith. After flipping a coin, which lands leaning up against a newspaper, the Governor sees the paper and reads an article about Jefferson Smith and finally decides to appoint him as the next Senator.

The point of the pick was that Smith was inexperienced and would only be a pawn to whatever they wanted, instead what they got was a bug-eyed, kid in the candy store who believes and lives by the very foundation and ideas of the country. Smith is given a quick rundown by his secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who believes that Jefferson Smith is just a ploy to the Taylor political machine, only to realize that Smith is in fact sincere, honest, and completely blind to the politicalness of Washington.

Smith tries to get a bill passed that would allow the Federal Government to buy 200 acres of land in his home state for the Boy Rangers who would in turn pay back the loan. Problem is that the proposed land is future home to a dam that is going up to benefit the Taylor political machine, and what begins is the raw and brutal first hand Washington political eduation for Jefferson Smith.

Overall, the movie is AMAZING. I cannot stress this enough. The movie was miles ahead of it's time, and the American ideas put forth in the Bill of Rights and Constitution that a government of, for, and by the people rings in hopes that american idealism and patriotism and not political machines is what makes this country great.

I recommend this film to any classic movie fan, political buff, or to any high school and middle school teachers who want to showcase the american dream and idea that one man can make a difference.",1280102400,5,2204,4.583756345177665

Certainly it's a Capra classic that spotlights Jimmy Stewart in both his famous ""aw-shucks"" mode and his most passionate angry-man role, and certainly it has things to say about how politics was done in the late '30's and, unfortunately, is still done.  But the ending is oddly unsatisfying, which tends to spoil it for me.

Jefferson Smith (Stewart) is a beloved youth leader in a ""Western state"" (probably Montana or Wyoming), the son of a crusading newspaper editor who was shot in the back at his desk by persons unknown.  Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains), who was Smith Sr.'s closest friend, has risen over the years from crusading attorney to iconic U.S. Senator, but he's done it at the cost of his own integrity.  When his opposite number dies unexpectedly, the ineffectual Gov. Hubert ""Happy"" Hopper (Guy Kibbee) is urged by his six young sons to name Smith to fill out his term, a solution he seizes on eagerly as a way of getting out from in between the independent media and the Machine run by media mogul James Taylor (Edward Arnold).  Smith is bowled over by the honor and his dazzled reaction to Washington (he slips out of the railroad station and boards a sightseeing bus, throwing his inherited staff and his handler Chick McGann (Eugene Pallette) into a tizzy) is one of the most enjoyable parts of the film.  He's painfully, naively honest and almost unbelievably patriotic, and Paine and Taylor know they'll never be able to get him to vote for their upcoming relief bill if he realizes there's a provision in it to build a dam exactly where he wants to locate a camp for boys from all over the nation.  Meanwhile, his secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), a sassy woman wise in the ways of Washington dealmaking, is trying not to be won over by Smith's idealism, and newspaperman Diz Moore (Thomas Mitchell), who worships her, is trying hard not to fall for it either, since he knows, as she does, that it can't survive.  Or can it?  Smith's climactic 23-hour filibuster is one of the peaks of Stewart's career, as he struggles against a jaded body of counterparts and Saunders fights behind the scenes to get the truth out to the people of his state, while Taylor's machine does its best (or worst) to block it.  (Harry Carey Sr., as the President of the Senate, is a delight: you can tell he sympathizes with Smith, but he's constrained by the Senate's rules of order and tries hard not to show it.)  At a time when Americans are even more cynical about Washington than they were 70-odd years ago, and when a President who campaigned on idealism and change is struggling to push his agenda through, the movie is still very pertinent; but, at least to me, the perhaps purposely vague final scene seems to say that all efforts may still be in vain.",1265155200,2,2888,4.619140625

889762,5,6304481691,"1939 is widely accepted as one of the best years in cinema, and I have to agree.  Even if I don't consider `Gone With the Wind' to be the sweeping monumental epic so many tote it as, I have to attest to the fact that it is a great movie and helps compliment a year chuck full of even `greater' films; the best of which is `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'.

I will protest this till the day I die; `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is a better film than `Gone With the Wind' and `The Wizard of Oz', and that isn't saying that either of those two films are not good, because both of them are (and `Oz' is FANTASTIC), but `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' has something neither of them really possess, at least not at the moment, and that is relevancy.  Even today `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' has the ability to step on toes and generate appraise and approval, even outside of the political party.  Yes, it exposes the corruption that we see taking place every day, but it also can be brought down to a more personal and intimate level to represent the earnest fight for justice in all avenues of life.

Take this out of a political setting and you still have a very moving and poignant look at human relations.

The film tells the story of Jefferson Smith, a sort of boy scouts leader who is plucked from his small town and placed as a temporary senate seat filler.  He's nave but not stupid, and soon his ideals and goals begin to cause friction among his newfound peers as he, along with some help, uncovers deep seated corruption amongst the senate (or members within).  The third act, which almost entirely takes place in the senate meeting hall, is as riveting and suspenseful as they come, and it still manages to bring on a sense of sheer nervous terror even upon multiple viewings.

This is due in LARGE part to Stewart's brilliant performance, not to mention Frank Capra's detailed and precise direction.

If there is any doubt in anyone's mind that James Stewart was one of the best actors of all time then they really need to see this movie.  In fact, watch this and then watch `Vertigo', `The Philadelphia Story', `Anatomy of a Murder' and `It's a Wonderful Life'.  The man was a genius who could effortlessly adapt to any role, and did so with a grace and intensity almost unheard of in his generation.  `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is one of his best performances.  He incorporates romance, comedy, dramatic tension and sheer suspense to create a stunningly complete character.  He's aided marvelously by a slew of talented actors, not the least of which is leading lady Jean Arthur.  I love Vivian Leigh as much as the next person, but the best leading actress performance of 1939 was undoubtedly Jean Arthur.  She was funny, charming, sincere and engaging; never dropping the ball once.  She delivers one of my favorite performances of all time and should have at least been nominated (in fact, the two best performances in the Leading Actress category weren't even nominated that year, for second in line is none other than Dorothy herself; Judy Garland).

Claude Rains was marvelously controlled, Edward Arnold perfected the `sly creep' and Thomas Mitchell was delightful in his every scene.  I'm a tad baffled at Harry Carey's Oscar nomination, especially when Arnold or Mitchell were much more deserving (Rains was nominated alongside Carey), but he was effective and actually quite amusing in his few scenes.

In the end I stand by my initial statement.  `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is a stunning film that stands the tests of time and remains as powerful today as it was in 1939, maybe even more so.  If you haven't yet seen this masterpiece waste no more time.  See it now, for you will forever be thankful you have.",1253232000,5,3737,4.61875945537065
889763,4,6304481691,"Yes, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON literally gushes with sappy melodrama, and is presented with the wide-eyed, ""Aw shucks"" naivete so characteristic of the times, yet this Frank Capra classic about a young, star-struck Senator (James Stewart) getting framed by corrupt power brokers and political bosses, and his subsequent defense of his character and integrity, still strikes a chord over 70 years later.  Stewart's impassioned speech on the Senate floor--following his character's 23-hour filibuster--is perhaps this actor's career hallmark.

This film is augmented by several Capra regulars, including Jean Arthur as Senator Smith's assistant--a woman well-versed in the machinations of Senate decorum, yet vulnerable enough to find herself falling for her boss.  Thomas Mitchell, a Capra veteran, is solid playing a scrappy newspaperman, and Edward Arnold plays the political boss heavy with steadfast aplomb.  I very much enjoyed Claude Rains as the senior senator from Smith's home state--a senator very much in on all the graft and corruption, but from his demeanor the viewer can tell his character abhors what he's doing, and the politician he's become.  And finally, Harry Carey is a delight playing the President of the Senate, a quiet man secretly rooting Senator Smith on.  All memorable characters indeed, making MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON a classic that still resonates.

889764,4,6304481691,"There is nothing new I can add to this film that would make any difference. The film in itself is well known and it is a Capra film. Nevertheless, after having watched it at least half a dozen times, I can't help seeing something entirely different in it. I have realized that this film is about Miss Saunders as it is about Mr. Smith. Miss Saunders' is powerfully disruptive in this film. It's hard not to see that she has the 'know how' in politics that the naive Smith doesn't have. From the very beginning we can see how Saunders is disruptive: she manages the press conference allowing its members to ridiculize him; she threatens with resignation, arguing that she is not a hired nurse; when she finds out that Mr. Smith plans to make his park for children in the Willet Creek area, she doesn't stop him. Instead, she lets the bomb explode in the Senate. Finally, she encourages Smith to make a stand and tutors him in fillibustering the Senate. It is also quite interesting that Capra stresses the male orientation of the Senate then, since Senator Paine and Taylor pit themselves against Mr. Smith, and there is no hint that they could ever make Saunders responsible. The only person that is aware of her role is the President of the Senate, who keeps staring above him, at the audience. It's a pity, I think, that Capra didn't see the potential of the Saunders character at the end of this film. When Saunders declares her love for Smith, her motivers for being behind the scenes shifts from the ""brain"" behind the political sabotage to one of a romantic leading lady. I think it weakens her character.

Another reason I didn't like the ending was because I thought it was done hastily because of time limitations. Capra raised tensions pretty high, only to let go of them too quickly. But it is worth watching a dozen times.

Besides, Saunders explanation of how to make law in Washington is the kind of school material that I bet teachers may be using in their classroom. Even if things mentioned in the film are not exactly like today in the U.S. Senate, they can still be useful for comparison and contrast.",1248134400,4,2120,4.591029023746702

889766,5,6304481691,"The movie is 70 years old now, and it is still a captivating film after all these years. Jefferson Smith (the perfectly cast James Stewart) has just been chosen to be a replacement for a now-deceased senator with a flip of a coin. He has high expectations as he finds himself in Washington D.C. But his expectations turn out to be lower as expected as he finds corruption in Congress. Still clinging on to hope, Smith proposes a bill that would undo at least some of the dark side of the United States Capitol. Of course, it doesn't go too well as he is accused of making money from his own bill.

There is clear evidence here that the legendary James Stewart gives one of his most gripping performances. The ending is the highlight of his God-like acting abilities; in fact, I could say that it's the highlight of his acting career. Claude Rains is excellent as Senator Paine, although I do wish we seen more of him on film. Truly underrated. Jean Arthur is also worthy of mention. She fits the part of Saunders very well, and she adds great chemstry between her and Smith.

Jean Arthur is the most fun of all the actors to watch in here and actually her ""Clarissa Saunders"" might be the lead character, not Stewart's.

I will say it's very dated, but some of that corny stuff adds to the enjoyment of the story. Some of it is refreshing, too, like the unashamed overt promotion of solid values, for instance .  You don't see that much patriotism or values-first themes in movies anymore.

I have sources that tell me a film was made 10 years later that depicted the Republican as a good guy, but I could not verify it. To the best of my knowledge, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is the last big screen film in which the Democrat was the bad guy, and even then it is only inferred. In Capra's classic, a Midwestern political machine based on the corrupt Democrat organization in Kansas City that Harry Truman rose to power in, is exposed by an idealistic young Senator (Stewart). Claude Rains plays the Truman character. He looked just like him, and in end gives a Senate floor mea culpa of his complicity with Democrat crimes, which is highly, precisely and to quintessential effect the same one ""Give 'em hell Harry"" should have given, but never did. All is not lost for the Democrats, however, because Stewart is still a Democrat, and the hope for the future.

A young James Stewart is perfectly cast as Jefferson Smith, the nave leader of a local Boy Scouts-type organization, who is swept into office as his state's junior senator by the all-powerful political machine headed by a Boss Tweed-like figure, media mogul Jim Taylor. In awe of the senior senator, Joseph Paine, Smith follows Paine's advice to push a bill for a national boys' camp back in the home state. A problem arises in the fact that the camp is to be built on the Willets Dam site which Taylor and Paine plan to use for graft. Along the way, Smith wins the support of his initially cynical secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who becomes inspired by Smith's integrity and encourages him to push the bill. This leads to his tenacious efforts to pass the bill, going as far as staging a 23-hour filibuster on the U.S. Senate floor. It's a monumental climax that Stewart turns into one of the most classic scenes in film history.

Supporting performances by familiar actors are uniformly strong with the wonderfully acerbic Jean Arthur as Saunders, Edward Arnold in full-bluster mode as Taylor, Harry Carey as the silently supportive Senate president and Claude Rains as the conflicted Paine, with Thomas Mitchell, Guy Kibbee, Eugene Pallette, H.B. Warner and Beulah Bondi in smaller roles. The one flaw is the abrupt ending in which one character experiences an instant transformation with little pay-off shown for Smith's efforts.

I can see why the congress at the time this movie was made tended to sneer at the portrayal of them in this movie.  Nearly everyone is corrupt, magalomaniacal, and more interested in personal glory than what's best for the country.  They cow-tow to the special interests, the press, who in this movie is the same person.

It's a little surprising to see factors back then still having relevance, such as a more and more monolithic press that is less and less capable of good, objective journalism.  I found the scam with the needless dam amusing, as it feels really tame by today's standards.  I think Mr.  Smith would have lost his lunch if he had to deal with the 750 billion dollar bailout bill today.

With the press, congress, and his complete inexperience against him, his only recourse is that someone still has conscience enough to stand up and fight with him.

In my opinion this film shows the faults and positives of our political system. A film like this really can give the viewer of what the true democracy system feels like and shows it only takes the courage of one man to stand up against corruption. Mr. Smith is that man who is not a career politician, just a common man that bleeds red, white and blue.

I was moved to tears during this great film, of course knowing in the back of my mind how the United States *IS* becoming more corrupt and undemocratic, given the major 'conflicts of interest' in organizations like our FDA (for example, big pharma execs sitting in on the board there, instead of impartial scientists), or the many political lobbyists 'whoring' themselves and their vested interests to our politicians who have seemed to forget the most important needs of the American people!  The message of political corruption in ""MSGTW"" is more relevant than ever in today's America on so many fronts.

Like Don Quixote, Smith tilts windmills: he stands up against the corrupt Senator Joseph Harrison Paine and wins. Cynical critics of Frank Capra derisively called his work ""Capra-corn."" The key question to ask at the end of the movie is whether Smith is too simple minded and nave to survive in the real world, or if the cynics are the fools for giving up on the honesty and faith that led the Founding Fathers to create the noble experiment which is America. Jean Arthur is a charm as the hard boiled blonde who is captivated by the innocent Smith and recaptures the faith in the goodness of people that she's lost in Washington. Capra movies are empowering.

Many patches of imperfection is present in the video and seeing as how Disney was able to upgrade ""Snow White"" which is an even older film to Dolby Digital 5.1, at least this option should have been available on this dvd as well.

Over 70 years old and it hasn't aged or lost its power - a remarkable achievement by any measure.  Replace the typewriters with PCs, and the telephones with mobile phones, and you have a story as relevant and powerful today as it was when it was released in 1939.  Perhaps it is sad to say that little has changed in politics or human nature since this film was released but that is why it is so important for people to view this film at least once.  Capra understood human nature and he understood the basis of evil, courage and human spirit.  This film embodies all these attributes.  It is a movie masterpiece.  Everyone should see this film at least once.  Those who have seen it once will see it again and again.  Released the same year as ""Gone with the Wind"" and, ironically, losing out on academy awards to same, ""Mr. Smith"" is the movie whose plot has remained as important as ever - that is, that even the most sophisticated and well conceived democratic institutions are, of themselves, insufficient to preserve democracy unless they elicit the participation of great men.  Or, as John Stuart Mill once wrote, in 1867, ""Bad men need nothing more to compress their ends than that the good men should look on and do nothing"".  In this film, Jefferson Smith is a man who has chosen to do something, and to thereby endeavor to make democracy work.  To this end, those who live in a democracy, and particularly its youth, should watch and learn because the lesson here is profound and far reaching.

Jimmy Stewart is at his all time best; Claude Rains, Edward Arnold and Jean Arthur are all brilliant.  This movie is moving, powerful, funny, poignant and relevant to the 21st Century.  One has to ask where such talent exists in today's movie making - apparently talent, writing skills and acting skills have all given way to special effects and big explosions.

Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is a young youth leader, elected senator in Washington D.C.  He is viewed as a hapless pawn, and naive at that.  Little do those who elected him realize his furtitude and determination.  That is especially made evident in the eyes of Clarice (Jean Arthur), an aide.  An evil senator (Claude Rains) is determined to silence him, in the most cruel and relentless manner.  Will justice prevail?  Or will Smith go home without a fight?

I have heard numerous times when pundits rally against current Hollywood and their supposedly ""anti-American"" practices, they always site this film as a great expression of how wonderful and perfect America is.  Obviously, they did not see the film.  The senators, representatives, governors, and their ilk are portrayed as cynical, corrupt individuals, and, sadly, that's still true today.  When Jefferson Smith is appointed, he's like a naive schoolboy.  He knows more about US history than all of Washington does.  But when he learns how corrupt Washington is, he refuses to be a stooge and decides to stand up for himself.  Then the political machines come down on him.  Instead of going away, he fights back (which leads to the famous filibuster scene).  This is a great film, but it is not the naive film the pundits suggest.  It's a sadly accurate portrayal of our political system.  It's actually more realistic than an episode of The West Wing.  The characters in this film are pretty accurate, as opposed to the silly, idealistic naiviete on the West Wing.  The dialogue is wonderful, all of the performances are superb, and Capra's direction are excellent.  Notice that Capra doesn't cut as much as modern directors do.  The film is still pretty fast, but would be considered slow by today's standards.  A great American film, one that probably couldn't be made today.  Let's hope that they don't remake this (they already did with Billy Jack Goes to Washington, which was one of the worst films I've ever seen)....",1151971200,11,1705,4.968197879858657

I have always been a big fan of the film work of Frank Capra and one of my favorite actors is Jimmy Stewart. I love Stewart's acting because it is so convincing and just filled with raw talent that is so inspiring. Between the scene where he begins to break the Elder Senator down with the statement "" The lost causes are the ones most worth fighting for"" and the scene where hes talking about the environment with his staffer, I always get goosebumps and that little tear in my eye. I also find his role as Jefferson Smith very inspiring as a young, idealistic populist in today's society. This movie will stand the test of time and more relevant than ever in relations to our current federal government today. I will always love this movie and after I graduate from school, I plan on teaching high school government and will definitely show this film to my students and hopefully will inspire all of them.",1150848000,3,1070,4.436548223350254
889909,5,6304481691,"Jimmy Stewart plays Senator Jefferson Smith in this 1939 classic.  Smith has been appointed to fill the seat of a deceased senator by the governor of his state.  Smith, both a neophyte and a young idealist, arrives in Washington and finds himself head to head against corrupt politics and conniving media. Ultimately, Smith prevails over the corruption as he fights to create a boys camp in his home state, forever cementing this movie as part of American political culture.

 This movie is about the navigating the confluence of reality and idealism.  In many ways, it is a feel good movie as good wins out in the end.  Truth wins out, civic spirit trumps narrow self-interest and love is found all to the benefit of the vanguard of morality: Senator Jefferson Smith.

 The interactions between senators, media, staff and party bosses make the movie feel realistic to what an outsider, like me, thinks Washington must be like.  Constituents, money and congressional peers make navigating through the halls of government awfully difficult.  Reputations can be built or destroyed on the altar of truth.

 The most resonant theme of the movie is the notion that outsiders can come to Washington to change the status quo.  Obviously, Jefferson Smith was not elected and had no electoral platform, but we hear time and time again of politicians who are not ""Washington Insiders"" who if elected posses the courage, morality and strength to change the system. It is easy to want to call these politicians nave, or simplistic when they espouse these views.  If they get to Washington they will learn that the legislative process is rooted in compromise, which means that competing interests give and take in order to move things forward. In the movie, Smith takes on a deeply populist tone, and is willing to go it alone as long as he thinks the people are with him.",1150848000,2,1859,4.8789808917197455

While this may not always happen in America, deep down, no matter how cynical we may feel, we HOPE that it can happen...

While you may be tempted to decry Jimmy Stewart's character's idealism and naivity in this movie, this movie powerfully demonstrates that our unwillingness to expose political wrongs and stand up for what we believe may be a ""safe"" bet, but it also ensures that the corruption machine never stops. With half of eligible voters staying away from the polls on election days, this movie couldn't be more important, 60 years after it was released.

Instead of becoming the yes-man his colleagues are figuring on, he bucks the system and restores ""integrity"" to the Capitol with a 23+ hour filibuster. Jean Arthur is his secretary who knows the ropes, and Claude Rains is the heavy.

890019,5,6304481691,"This depression-era tale of a simple, somewhat naive boy scout leader thrust into the complicated operations of the U.S. Senate is a humorous, likable, and ultimately inspirational drama about the courage to stand for one's principals in the face of terrible slander and corruption.

  Some political heavies are wrangling over who to select to serve out the term of a Senator who has vacated his seat near the end of a term.  The well-meaning but indecisive Governor is put under pressure to select a toady for their schemes, but then is suprisingly lobbied by his precocious children over dinner to select the ""best man for the job,"" the leader of their Boy Rangers group, Mr. Jefferson Smith (played by James Stewart) who ""can recite parts of the Declaration of Independence by heart.""  A deal is struck, and the unassuming Mr. Smith is soon on a train to Washington, meeting the elder Senator from his state, suavely played by Claude Rains, and his socialite daughter Susan (as he meets her, Stewart's nervous fumbling with his hat is close to priceless).

  The patriotic Smith is in heaven touring Washington, D.C. until some cynical reporters try to lampoon him in their papers.  When Smith's simple idea to write a bill for a boy's camp on Willet Creek in his home state interferes with a graft scheme of the main political heavy (a mean, almost slimy Edward Arnold performance), sparks fly on the Senate floor.  Up against the wall, Sen. Smith and his secretary (played by Jean Arthur), a sardonic cynic who discovers her heart with Smith, orchestrate a last-minute plan to filibuster the Senate to stand for the kind of government he'd read about in civic books but is not seen too much in Washington.  The rest of the film is epic, and some of Director Frank Capra's finest moments.

  This black and white film has a kind of charming 1930's atmosphere and dialogue, but the issues dealt with are timeless, and represent pointed criticism of Congress' political processes even today, and keenly observes the at times detracting influence of media and money interests.  With the filibuster coming under criticism from majority forces in the Senate recently, an idealistic Mr. Smith is exactly what they don't want to see happen.  The People for the American Way have utilized a clip from this film in a commercial aimed to help save the filibuster, where Jimmy Stewart calls for a chance for him ""to speak his peace.""",1114041600,5,2427,4.854368932038835
890020,5,6304481691,"""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" directed by Frank Capra, is a classic movie that makes the audience feel compelled to do something significant with their lives.  It does this by using a combination of a compelling story, abstract terms, set design, cinematic techniques, actors, a great director, and final scene.  It uses all of these to produce the desired influence on the audience.

""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is a story about the little guy and his lost causes.  Mr. Smith, a small town leader of the Boy Rangers, is caught up in a political spider's web.  He goes to the senate because the people devising this particular web think he will be a passive person.  However, Mr. Smith shows everyone what freedom of speech really is.  In his filibuster speech, Mr. Smith slowly changes the senate's view of both Taylor and the law, which they are creating in this nation's capital.

The many abstract terms, within Washington, shows the audience the history of America's causes.  The Lincoln Memorial is the center point of the film.  It seems to be the center of Mr. Smith's strength.  Just looking at it helps Smith feel better.  I believe the movie uses this monument because Lincoln's fight is one of the greatest lost causes won in American history.  The movie also uses other famous buildings, like the capital dome, in order to impress the magnitude of Smith's feelings for America on the viewers.

The many famous places that Smith visited, during his first tour through Washington D.C., are the actual buildings.  But, there are sets that were made for this movie.  For example, the Boy Rangers building, Smith's office, and Pain's house are all well-done sets.  The design of the sets gives the director the ability to shoot with a great depth of field, which he uses throughout the movie.

The director, Frank Capra, uses many cinematic techniques throughout his movie.  He uses not only depth of field, but also camera movement, camera placement, and lighting to portray his ideas.  The camera movement is very subtle unless a person is looking for it.  Capra uses the movement only to follow the action so a viewer is expecting the movement.  The camera placement is very noticeable especially during Smith's filibuster.  It starts out looking down at Smith, but by the end of his speech, it is looking up at him, giving him authority.  As for the lighting, the Lincoln Memorial's lighting is the part that sticks in my head.  The pillar's shadow, which falls on Smith, seems to be hiding him from the rest of Washington.  And, at the same time, portrays Smith's sorrowful mood.

James Stewart, who is a superb actor, played Smith.  I believe Stewart has a knack for this kind of role.  He has the ability to create a believable character.  His facial expressions look realistic and not rehearsed.  I have yet to see a better actor, from that period, than James Stewart.  He is so good that I view other movies merely because he is in them.  This movie is what solidified Stewart's movie career.  Frank Capra was smart to use Stewart instead of the original suggestion, Gary Cooper, to star in his movies.

Capra is a great director.  ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" received eleven Oscar nominations, and won a Best Motion Picture Story.  This movie was Capra's last film.  During his career, he won three Oscars.  Capra, also, inspired other great directors like Hitchcock.  Many people consider Frank Capra the first great American director.  His techniques continue to live on through other directors.

Capra's final scene is also the climax of this movie.  Everything is building up to this point.  Throughout this scene, Capra uses all of the different abilities at his disposal.  He uses camera angles, camera movement, suspense, and great acting to produce a memorable final scene.

Every time I watch ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" it creates a subtle feeling inside me.  Why do I let some things go, even when I know I am right?  If this man can speak his mind in the senate, I can make a call or write a letter to my local officials.  But, this movie also makes the viewer think.  Could my local officials be like those in the movie?  Sometimes, I wish there was someone in a seat of power that a citizen could trust.  Someone truly like Mr. Smith, and not just a wolf in sheep's clothing.  But, like Mr. Smith, will a true sheep get taken to the slaughter?  Mr. Smith does survive, but by the skin of his teeth.

This film's elements create the final feeling of patriotism for the audience.  Without these elements, the film would not have portrayed its message with the power it did.  During a fireside chat, President Roosevelt once stated, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear its self.""  This movie shows its audience the only way the enemy will win is if we give in to the fear that it tries to instill in us.",1112745600,4,4847,4.709177592371871

I have sources that tell me a film was made 10 years later that depicted the Republican as a good guy, but I could not verify it. To the best of my knowledge, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is the last big screen film in which the Democrat was the bad guy, and even then it is only inferred. In Capra's classic, a Midwestern political machine based on the corrupt Democrat organization in Kansas City that Harry Truman rose to power in, is exposed by an idealistic young Senator (Stewart). Claude Rains plays the Truman character. He looked just like him, and in end gives a Senate floor mea culpa of his complicity with Democrat crimes, which is highly, precisely and to quintessential effect the same one ""Give 'em hell Harry"" should have given, but never did. All is not lost for the Democrats, however, because Stewart is still a Democrat, and the hope for the future. In reality, the Democrats just got more corrupt, and Hollywood would be their willing ally.

Yes, it is a truly great movie, and the DVD has some extra goodies, but there is no reason why it still should be way over $20 in price. That being said, there are few films that might be worth it and this is one of them. It still captures the essence of what being an American is--or what it should be. The lone man voicing his ideas against the machine, reminding us of what sanity is, of what priorities should be. At no time in American history is such a voice needed more than now: we want to send nearly $100 Billion to our enemy while people here will starve today. If that isn't the ""Taylor machine"" I don't know what is. This film speaks to the real war on terror--the grip that power and greed have on this country at any given time. In movies, especially Frank Capra movies, it all comes out ok in the end, even though many of his films have a suicidal crisis in them at some point. Meet John Doe, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, It's a Wonderful Life, and Mr. Smith all have a suicide that nearly happens. Why would that be,in the films of Frank Capra, considered the ""feel good"" director of all time? Because at some point life can become not worth living when all of its better values have been perverted, when it seems hopeless and that there is no way out of the madness,when one cannot bear all the tension and contradiction.(Gee, sorry for such a downer review). It might have something to do with the fact that the country was in the ""Great Depression"", economically and psychologically in the group sense, and that things really were pretty bleak. In Capra films, the response to despair is hope (that the badness will relent) and kindness (the kindness of others towards the unfortunate). And maybe that is the answer for our time as well. Where will we find it? Anyway, all this malarkey aside, Mr. Smith is a great movie, full of laughs, drama, and telling satire, a landmark performance by Jimmy Stewart, and well supported by a great cast all around--Claude Rains, Thomas Mitchell, Jean Arthur, Harry Carey, Edward Arnold.

We're clearly shown from the beginning that he's not meant to be there as a man of principle; he's there to be a pawn of the other Senator from that state (Sen. Paine), and Sen. Paine cares about nothing but padding the pockets of one VERY powerful, rich, and influential private citizen (James Taylor).
When Sen. Smith's one pet project threatens to run headlong into Mr. Taylor's plans to make money, however, Sen. Smith finds himself firmly in the cross-hairs not only of Mr. Taylor, but also of Sen. Paine (who will do anything -- and I do mean anything) to maintain his corrupt dealings in the Congress of the United States.
So what disheartened me is, frankly, the way the movie ended.  DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE.  Sen. Smith's battle is hard-fought, and yes, you feel like he's the hero for standing up for the principles of democracy, etc. etc....  But he's fighting a losing battle.  Were it not for that strange change-of-heart in (literally) the final minute of the movie, Sen. Smith WOULD have lost, and the Fat Cats would have won.  And, frankly, I can't imagine that that last-minute change-of-heart would ever actually occur in any modern political climate.
So yes, this movie is about democracy, but not the way I thought.  The movie instead comes perilously close to sending a message that the laws in this country are actually passed by rich, powerful men who have only their own personal interests in mind and not those of the Common Man.  It highlights the seedy underbelly of the way the laws of this country are passed.
I didn't walk away from this movie proud of the way the Framers intended the U.S. Senate to work.  I came away from this movie thinking that it was just too close to reality, where special interests dominate the lawmaking process and the little guy who stands up for truth and righteousness gets run over by the unstoppable political machine.",1058745600,8,2550,4.62749445676275
890072,5,6304481691,"MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON remains after sixty years one of the most compelling political films ever made. If Thomas Jefferson Smith's wide-eyed patriotism seems naive and overly innocent following decades that have seen McCarthyism, Vietnam, the rise of the Industrial-Military complex that Eisenhower warned us against, Watergate, Iran-Contra, and an attempted right wing cabal (via a partisan impeachment trial), perhaps this says more about where events have taken us rather than where it would be good for us to be. More depressing is the fact that the Senate (and the House) look more like the people Jefferson Smith opposes in the film, than Smith.
What makes this film continue to be such riveting viewing despite the very different world in which we live? Much of the script is part of the reason. There is a great deal of first-rate dialogue (even if portions seem a bit outdated), and some of Smith's speeches remain enormously effecting. But if I had to point to a primary reason, it is the acting. Put different actors in several key roles, and a film that might have been watchable in 1939 would be unviewable today. Jimmy Stewart makes this film. Has there been another actor who could have played this role, imbuing it with equal parts charming naivete, passionate patriotism, unmitigated optimism, and everyday wisdom while not in any sense making Mr. Smith look silly? I doubt it. Jean Arthur in several films managed the transition from cynic to believer as well as anyone short of Barbara Stanwyck. The film features a long and rich number of supporting actors, from Claude Rains to Thomas Mitchell to Edward Arnold to Eugene Pallette. But my favorite was Harry Carey, who plays the President of the Senate, though more with his eyes and smile as much as his voice. Carey had been one of the great stars of the silent screen in Westerns, but for some inexplicable reason never found the same success in sound. John Wayne often paid homage to Carey by physically mimicking gestures that were identified with Carey, in particular standing akimbo, with one arm laying across his chest to grasp his other arm just above the elbow. When Wayne made that gesture, it was as good as 'quoting' Carey, and all Western fans would recognize it as such. The cast is crucial, because even by 1939 standards, the entire story is more than a little naive, but the actors managed to 'sell' the story magnificently. The result is nothing short of magnificent.
This film had a huge impact on the 1940 Best Oscar decision. Today, looking back on 1940, I don't think there is any question that Henry Fonda clearly deserved the award for his work in THE GRAPES OF WRATH. His portrayal of Tom Joad is one of the great performances by an actor in the history of American cinema, not merely the finest performance that year. Yet, Jimmy Stewart won instead for his role of Macauley 'Mike' Connor in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, an award that he clearly didn't win compared to Henry Fonda's Tom Joad. Why? The Academy voters felt bad that he hadn't won the year before for his superb performance in MR. SMITH. In one of the most competitive Oscar competitions for Best Actor ever, Robert Donat managed an upset victory over Stewart, Clark Gable in GONE WITH THE WIND, and Laurence Olivier in WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Fonda didn't feel too badly, since he and Stewart were lifelong best friends.",1054425600,2,3378,4.825862068965518
890073,5,6304481691,"Ah, 1939...the year brought us Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind, Stagecoach, and of course, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, considered by many to be Capra's finest film and one of Stewart's best performances. And Jean Arthur was great in the film too. As was Claude Rains. And Joseph Walker's cinematography was beautiful. Mr. Smith is the typical Capra movie, the little guy fights the machine, patriotic, and touching. It gets a little melodramatic at the very end of the movie, but other than that it is a wonderful film. It's not the type of movie I normally like, but Capra, Stewart, Rains, Jean Arthur and Joseph Walker do such a great job, that I can't help but love the film.
The dvd contains a featurette, Frank Capra, Jr. looks back and a commentary track by Capra, Jr. You don't get much of an insight from Capra Jr (after all, he was only like 4 or 5 when the film was made), but he does give some nice background, history and stories about his father. And it is interesting to watch when he gets silent--when the film captivates him so much that he stops talking and watches the movie. Not as good as a director's commentary, but since Sr is dead, Jr does well enough.",1043625600,4,1179,4.462962962962963
890074,5,6304481691,"It is hard to believe that Jean Arthur gets top billing in this classic Capracorn film, given Jimmy Stewart's unforgettable performance in the final act of this film.  But then it is equally hard to believe a film that spends several minutes explaining how a bill becomes law without resorting to animation and a catchy song.  Still, the fact that Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart teamed up at all to make this movie is pretty remarkable.  Capra wanted to film the Lewis R. Foster story ""The Gentleman From Montana,"" but learned Rouben Mamoulian had already agreed to make the film.  So Capra traded ""Golden Boy"" for the film so he could use Gary Cooper for a ""Mr. Deeds goes to Washington"" film.  But Cooper was unavailable, so Capra turned to Stewart, whom he had used in ""You Can't Take It With You.""  The rest is cinematic history.
I think Stewart's performance grows over the course of the film, as does his character.  The climatic filibuster scene is a great example of acting, both by the lead actor and the wonderful ensemble cast.  The performance I really love in this film is by Harry Carey as the President of the Senate, a marvelous bit of getting the most out of a small part.  Claude Raines as Senator Joseph Paine embodies a civilized gentleman throughout the film, until the exciting climax.  Both actors were nominated for Supporting Actor Oscars. Jean Arthur as Saunders is also in fine form (by 1939 standards she deserved top billing), but then it is impossible to find a part that does not click in this film.  Edward Arnold gets to play the bad guy, Beulah Bondi is mom, Guy Kibbee the blustering politician, and Thomas Mitchell the sarcastic journalist, and so the Capra players are very much in evidence.
I always have trouble deciding if it is ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" or ""Meet John Doe"" that is the most idealistic of the Capracorn films.  My answer is usually whichever film I saw last.  But ""Mr. Smith"" is clearly aimed at politicians while ""John Doe"" speaks more to the people, so that would probably be the deciding factor.  I was fortunate that the first time I saw this film it was in what was called an ""art theater"" in those dark days before home video when such things were a staple near college campuses, and I can still remember being just riveted to the final act and totally convinced, like Saunders, that Jefferson Smith was toast.  Kudos to Sidney Buchman for the script.  Some people might find the Americana to be a bit much, but I have managed to remain inspired by the symbols of our country while having pretty much total disdain for the people who are elected to office.  But then you have to admit, Jimmy Stewart's character makes them all look like hacks, even across the chasm of over half-a-century.",1033171200,4,2755,4.635802469135802

Kinda has a strange voice... which you kind of get accustomed to after a while I guess.
I can recommend this movie even though it didn't leave me saying, ""Hey, I have to get that movie!"" I have to believe that anyone with a bit of patriotism (I don't possess much of it) would find this much more stimulating than I do.

890076,5,6304481691,"I first watched this wonderful movie about six months after I arrived in America from a country where there was little personal freedom.  I had just taken an ESL American history class in high school, and had understood little.  This movie was simply a great eye-opener for me, a foreigner with little notion of the American freedom.
Capra's masterpiece depicted an America rife with with corruption, with lies and ruthless men to whom America was a money and power machine.  Against this backdrops stands Jefferson Smith, the hero, who is picked as a stooge senator for his home state by the political machine.  (The original screen play identifies the state as Montana; Capra said it was Illinois; but isn't Jackson City the capital of Mississippi?)  His innocence and ideals -- and incorrutibility -- immediately warm the heart of every audience member.  He's indeed the light in the dark tunnel, the hope for every American who feels that what this great country stands for is shamelessly disregarded and discarded by our politicians.
The classic filibuster scene is such a joy to watch, esp. for people who don't quite get what a filibuster is.  (Of course, how Mr. Smith could go on talking for 23 hours 16 minutes without going to the toilet puzzles me.)  The movie also lucidly explains how a bill is written, submitted for consideration, debated, compromised, and finally sent for vote, in the House and the Senate.  It's both an entertaining and educational movie.
The filibuster scene may strike some us lecturing.  Indeed, the senators in the movie turn a deaf ear to the earnest speeches of Mr. Smith.  Democracy, freedom, accountability, ""government of the people by the people for the people"", all mean nothing to these people.  Equally amazing, when the film was screened by Congress in 1939, they damned the film as un-American for depicting them as thieves and stooges.  Alas, in film and in real life, politicians are simply people without a conscience.  As a naturalized American, I feel all these people should be executed, for betraying the very basic foundation of this country.
I re-watched the movie recently in the aftermath of Sept. 11.  My eyes became wet as I listened to Mr. Smith begging his colleagues to wake up their conscience.  It's a shame that our politicians, ranging from George W. Bush to the donkeys in Congress to some judges, are still thieves, clowns, and traitors to the American ideal of universal liberty.  Every day they chip away at the foundation of America by allowing corrupt business leaders to rob the nation of its wealth, by letting terrorists come in at ease and killing us at will, and by turning blind eyes and deaf ears at the plight of the middle class.  Like Senator Paine in the movie, every politician of today pretends they represent the people, while in fact they represent nothing but their selfish needs.
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is IMHO the best movie of all time.  It's not because it has great acting or fancy special effects.  It's because it addresses an endangered concept, first brought forth by America's founding fathers, the concept that this country was to be better than any other country, past or present.  And I'm not talking about just being richer or having more Playstation games.",1027296000,33,3270,4.898366606170599

You find yourself  rooting for Jefferson.  The final part is worth every nickel.  No, it wasn't good acting that made that hoarse voice, Jimmy went to a doctor who put some mercury in his throat!
Not a whole lot of extra features.  Its a shame that Jimmy Stewart couldn't have lived a few more years to give a audio commentary.  Nethertheless, Frank Capra Jr, gives some insights.

890098,5,6304481691,"This movie is perfect for 4th of July, or for any day, for that matter. It is funny and heartwarming, and shows the true meaning of democracy in our country. Basically, it is the story of Jefferson Smith, a young and naive boy scout leader who is chosen to replace one of his state's Senators for a short time.
Essentially, Smith is chosen as the replacement because the corrupt officials in his state just want someone they think they can manipulate easily. Unluckily for them, however, it turns out that Smith is not the easily controlled weakling they thought he would be. Instead of simply listening to his superiors, Smith begins to figure things out for himself and to fight for what he believes in regardless of the consequences. Along the way, he is helped by Saunders, a cynical secretary, played by Jean Arthur.
This movie also features fantastic performances, especially by Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur.
Anyhow, this is a wonderful movie that really shows what our democracy should be all about. Although this movie was made in the late 1930s, it could have been made yesterday, for the issues it deals with are still very relevant today. The DVD is great - really worth getting!

James Stewart is flawless and absolutely irreplacable as that man - Jeff Smith. The stellar Capra stable of players from Jean Arthur to Edward Arnold to H. B. Warner are pitch perfect. But my special favorite may in fact be Claude Rains, who plays an honest man gone bad with such conflict and realism that he makes a potentially cartoon ""villain"" feel all the more palpably plausible. This is why ""Mr. Smith"" may be the ne plus ultra of idealistic films but it is not unrealistic. And I have yet to see any film sustain a half hour that matches this film's third act - the filibuster - in intensity and exaltation.

It's interesting to see how the reviews here reveal the film as a Rorschach test for viewers' political leanings. One sees it as taking a stand AGAINST the liberal Democrats in power at the time, another as raising an alarm AGAINST Republican business interests controlling corrupt politicians. That's funny, because I always thought the film was FOR something, that it was a monument to the American ideals of truth, justice, equality, and the common good - regardless of party.

One more thing: It disheartens me to read comments about how ""cheesy"" this film is and how all the idioms of the 1930s make it unwatchable. I think these writers are incapable of appreciating any culture but their own. They would probably go to Spain and make fun of the people that speak Spanish. Even though it's set in the US, this movie takes place in a different culture: Depression-era America.

The dinner table with the Governer and his children is classic.  I can't watch this movie without being in tears, particularly at a particular scene where a young boy is reading the Gettysburg Address at the Lincoln Memorial while an elderly Black Gentleman, (Who looked old enough to be a former slave and may well have been.) takes off his hat in reverence.  (I keep thinking what he would say to the idea that the civil war wasn't about slavery.) In the end I think the movie is (like the Star Wars series) less about the brave struggle of a youth fighting for his ideas than about the guilt and struggle of the man who has abandoned his.  This may be quite unfair of me but I suspect many in congress have with the best intentions made the same deal that Sen Payne (Raines) makes in this film.

There is no recognition of the enormous amount of effort and intelligence a politician must haveto work effectively in government--they are all corrupt and evil.

Hollywood then could do that, not today, and I really don't understand why.
I just would like to add one fact to praise this DVD, and encourage everybody who visits this page to buy it, even if they have seen the movie; in many cases, great polular classics are oftenly viewed on poor prints and video masters, because of the very popularity of the film, the prints and negatives tend to get damged. overused, often replaced with inferior film elements. Thus, a great classic for everybody becomes a great film that one's grandpa talked about, and would really look that old.
That is why a special notice should be given to this DVD, because The Library of Congress did a wonderful job rescuing and restoring the film. The trasnfer is from their restored print, which they worked out of the original camera negative. Some parts of the negative were also damged, but they succeeded in replacing them with film elements that are not apparently inferior. The result is, a sharper, detailed look that we have been unable to see for over 4 or 5 decades.

Together they take on the  Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a nave Washington  outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against  corruption and graft.  Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an  unnamed state after one of its Senators dies.  He is appointed because the  political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who  will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will  make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions.  When the wide eyed Smith  gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will  stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp.  When he  tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it  seem like he is the one taking graft.  This leads to the dramatic  confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get  the truth out.
This film is wonderful in so many ways.  The story is a  classic struggle between good and evil.  In typical Capra style, the  protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to  who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  If there is one clear  message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never  give up hope.  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for  characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to  basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.
I was dismayed  to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said  that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity.  This  is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it is inconceivable to young  people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not  the rule.
Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from  the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its  monuments and history.  The story brings us a confrontation between  political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the  truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold  on to power.  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling  comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.
Jean  Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by  Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to  Smith's noble homespun philosophies.  Claude Rains is also masterful as the  adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the  presidency.  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a  torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both  emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant  and pitiable.
This film is a national treasure.  It is on my top 50 list  of all time.  The story of corruption in politics, and the greatness of the  men who resist it, is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in  Washington today.  A 10/10.",960249600,3,3180,4.681238615664845
890183,5,6304481691,"Members of the U.S. senate were so outraged about this picture in 1939 (for all the wrong reasons) that there was actually talk of a retaliatory bill against the movie interests; the storm blew over after it became apparent that the public loved the film. Washington's youngest senator exposes corruption in high places, almost at the cost of his own career. Classic Capra with the little man coming out on top as he seldom does in life. Jimmy's sterling performance (probably his finest) is bolstered by Arthur and her excellent hard-boiled dame characterization.  Jean Arthur, of the teasing voice, is the knowing secretary who is at first horrified  by his simplicity.  When the young Senator's illusions are shattered, he stages a filibuster, defeats the villains, and re-establishes the whole government on a firm and honorable basis.  No one else could balance the ups and downs of wistful sentiment and corny homour the way Capra could - but if anyone else should learn to - kill him!  Carey is magnificent as the Vice-President, and Guy Kibbee does well as the venal governor.  Supreme gloss covers the corn and quirky direction keeps one watching; it's a treat listening to Stewart's voice go hoarse!  The brilliant script was written by Sidney Buchman.",958694400,,1262,5.009569377990431
890184,5,6304481691,"In my opinion ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"" is one of Frank Capra'a greatest directing efforts. Staring James Stewart and Jean Arthur it reminds me strongly of ""Mr Deeds goes to Town"" another one of Capra's films, made three years prior in 1936. One of the main reasons may  be that Jean Arthur seems to play the same character in both movies, with  different names of course. While Deeds was a fine film I think of it as a  dry run for Smith. Much of the best parts of the prior film were revisited  and a lot more was added to the mix.

Stewart plays Jefferson  Smith, the leader of an organization called the boys rangers which seems to  be something like the boy scouts. When a mid term senate vacancy appears in  Smith's state the beleaguered Governor selects him to fill the job. Why?  Because he couldn't name the candidate that his unofficial minder had  nominated without being crucified by the press and yet the new senator  could not represent a danger to the powers that be. Jefferson, being young,  inexperienced and popular with kids, turned out to be a perfect choice.

We are introduced to most of the main characters in the early part  of the film and straight away it is obviously a David vs Goliath story.  Pitted against Jefferson are a toadying Governor whose strings are pulled  by Jim Taylor, a sleazy big businessman in cahoots with the State's other  sitting Senator, Joseph Paine. Senator Paine is not only corruptly dealing  with Taylor in a plan to skim real estate funds from the public purse but  is also a childhood hero to Smith, because of his early years working as a  partner with Jefferson's Father.

The bad guys are quietly  confident that they can hoodwink the young Smith but of course the viewer  knows that they may not have it quite so easy. When Jefferson arrives in  Washington, after he finishes an impromptu tour of the city's historical  sites, he meets his personal assistant, known only as Saunders, played  aptly be Jean Arthur. Saunders is a cynical political player who has only  stayed in the job this long because of threats and  outright bribery from  Senator Paine. As a result she is not above sabotaging Smith's position  through the press. But this doesn't last long.

Jefferson quickly  proves to Saunders that his integrity and drive is not artifice as he dives  into a project to organize a national boys camp. Unfortunately the land  that he intends to use has been ear marked by Paine and Taylor for their  scheme. This leads to some interesting insights into the American political  system and the eventual head to head confrontation between Smith and  everyone else.

In the first battle Jefferson loses dramatically.  Paine trumped up some very thorough corruption charges against Smith and he  can not prove his innocence. Completely disheartened, Smith decides to give  up the fight at least until Saunders comes to bat and reinvigorates him.  Together they stage a fight back on the floor of the senate. And let me tell you, it is a very powerful finish,  one that shouldn't be missed.",957830400,6,3056,4.719165085388994
890185,5,6304481691,"This is one of Jimmy Stewart's best performances.
Jimmy Stewart plays Jefferson Smith, a leader of a boys' group who is quickly and without warning named senator of his state.  While serving he discovers that his  state is being run by corrupt men and will stop at nothing to return things  to the way they should be.
In all aspects, this movie shines.  A  captivating plot, a talented cast, and a solid message.  What more could  you ask for in a film?",956793600,,453,4.451219512195122
890186,5,6304481691,"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a timeless, brilliant parable of Good Vs. Evil, played out in the U.S. Senate. Good is represented by Jimmy Stewart, in the film he SHOULD have won an Oscar for (MGM, trying to bolster  'Goodbye, Mr. Chips' at the box office, influenced it's Academy members to  award Robert Donat with the statue; the following year, Stewart appeared in  'The Philadelphia Story', for MGM, and won Best Actor!). He is magnificent  as Jefferson Smith, an idealistic youth leader, who is offered up as an  innocent and gullible replacement for a Senate vacancy. Evil is personified  by Claude Rains, as the suave and corrupt senior Senator, and Edward  Arnold, brilliant as a ruthless party boss.
In many ways, 'Smith' is cut  from the same cloth as Capra's earlier masterpiece, 'Mr. Deeds Goes to  Town', and both films costar the radiant Jean Arthur, here cast as Smith's  secretary. She is an old hand at understanding political wheelings and  dealings, and at first, she considers her new boss a total idiot! But  Smith's integrity wins her over, and with the help of reporter Thomas  Mitchell (1939's busiest actor!), the three manage to outlast the forces of  Evil, in the most rousing filabuster Hollywood has ever filmed!
Two  supporting characters deserve special attention; Harry Carey, one of  Hollywood's most beloved Western stars, plays a warm, sympathetic Vice  President, in a small but very crucial role; and Beulah Bondi is terrific  as Stewart's mother (she would play his mother again in the Capra/Stewart  classic 'It's A Wonderful Life').
The new DVD edition offers the insights  of Frank Capra, Jr., son of the legendary filmmaker, as well as trailers,  vintage material, and a whole lot more!
If you've seen 'Mr. Smith Goes to  Washington' before, treat yourself with this lavish new edition! If you  haven't seen it, you are in for one of the most wonderful cinema  experiences you'll ever have, from the best year Hollywood ever had!
Simply put, this film is a masterpiece!",953683200,112,2013,4.958083832335329

Jimmy Stewart is a wonderful actor and in this movie he plays a simple, loyal, kind-hearted American, who believes in Freedom and our great country.  It  literally brought tears to my eyes.  It makes you feel something inside; a  feeling of pride for the princibles on which this country was founded.  It's not just a ""Good guy wins"" movie; it's inspirational and  quite frankly one of the best movies I have seen this year.",953164800,2,479,4.686746987951807
890239,5,6304481691,"I have to admit that I have never been a big fan of Frank Capra's directing or the stories he chose.  But this movie scores for me.  James Stewart is simply amazing as Jefferson Smith, the naive young man who  discovers that Washington and politicians are not what they seem to be.  Jean Arthur, an actress who seems to be forgotten these days, is excellent  as the secretary who has seen it all.  Claude Rains and Harry Carey do well  in supporting performances as a senator and the president of the Senate.  The underlying themes about political corruption and the power of the  people still work today.  The scenes surrounding the filibuster are  unforgettable, and you'll find yourself routing for the little guy,  something I thought I was too cynical to do myself.",952732800,6,770,4.706766917293233
890240,5,6304481691,"It isn't hard to imagine that our founding fathers envisioned politicians like Jefferson Smith. Of course we all know that a man with such integrity and idealism could never achieve political office. The reason: It's right  there in this movie. The Jim Taylors and Sen. Paines would never allow it.  Mr. Smith Goes To Washington isn't as artistic a film as Citizen Kane or  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but it's quite simply the most  entertaining and moving film I've ever seen. The reason: It's right there  in the movie. The greatest film actor of all time, in arguably his greatest  performance, and, in terms of commercial success, the greatest director in  arguably his greatest film. The reason I say arguably is because these two  teamed up for another film called It's A Wonderful Life. However, I think  Mr. Smith is a better movie. It's able to elicit the same emotion and  sentiment as It's A Wonderful Life, but it has a powerful message that  drives it. More importantly, Frank Capra believes in his subject and his  message. Some people accuse him of making commercial movies, not venturing  into deeper subject matter, and painting the world in unrealistic ways. But  how many of those same critics aren't completely engrossed in the movie  when Stewart filibusters before congress, one of the most powerful scenes  in film history. I guess Capra believed that there is a little good in all  of us and it takes a Mr. Smith to bring it out of us. That may be  commercial, shallow, and unrealistic but it's a nice thought anyway. And I  certainly don't want to be the one to prove Mr. Capra wrong. So what's  wrong with a movie that believes in Americanism and idealism, especially  when it is as well-made and well-acted as Mr. Smith.",951955200,10,1753,4.7194719471947195

890242,5,6304481691,"It's interesting to note how modern appraisals of this classic film highlight the contributions of male lead, James Stewart, and director, Frank Capra, but relegate Jean Arthur's performance to a lesser rank. Yet  both Stewart and Capra themselves respected and acknowledged her brilliance  - in an age supposedly more male-oriented than our own - so why don't we?  Arthur's character, Clarissa Saunders (or just plain Saunders) is pivotal  to the success of this film: making it possible for the audience to believe  in Smith's idealism. Arthur brings off this delicate assignment with gusto,  conviction and a sure comic touch. It may be Mr Smith's coming to  Washington on which the plot turns, but it's Ms Saunders who provides at  least as much of the energy and credibility. Just another reason for this  film's greatness.",946425600,2,828,5.119402985074627
890243,5,6304481691,"For all those folks who feel politics are a bore, you're about to receive a rude awakening.  Jimmy Stewart plays the young Jefferson Smith in this wonderful drama of a young boy-scout type who has been dropped into Daniel  Webster's seat in the Senate!  At first, Smith merely holds his seat  without saying much, but soon he begins to think of a great bill that would  change life for kids on the streets: a national boys' camp!  Little does he  know that a dam is about to go up where he wants his camp.  This movie  ends in a philibuster (sp?) with Smith standing for nearly 24 hours in the  Senate trying to prove his innocence after being framed by the people who  graphed the lands on Willet Creek (where camp is).  In the last few  dramatic moments, Smith feels all hope is lost, and faints dead away on the  congress floor.  At seeing this, the man who unwillingly framed him tries  to shoot himself.  Now everyone sees that Smith was right, and the camp  must go on!  This is my favorite movie and I recommend it to everyone.  If  you are planning a trip to Washington D.C., watch this movie, first.  It  will mean so much more to you.  It shows that truth, bravery, and  persistance are the only way that this great nation can survive.  I hope  that you will watch it with tears in your eyes and thank God for the great  nation that he has given you.  Thank you.",943574400,6,1372,4.312252964426878
