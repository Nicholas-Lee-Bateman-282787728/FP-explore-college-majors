7846132,4,6303427162,"Movie viewers familiar with 1930's serials will expect to see Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe as the hero in this installment in Lionsgate's Zane Grey Western Classics, but it was actually made before he bleached his hair and made his name as Flash Gordon, and features him in a secondary role.  Undercover Texas Ranger Jim Travis (Tom Keene, another B-film actor with a long roster of parts in Westerns and other genres) is attending a rodeo when he meets tenderfoot Jim Traft (Benny Baker), whose uncle and namesake, having established a successful ranch in Arizona, has retired to New York City and sent his nephew West to learn the cattle business in preparation for inheriting his property.  Traft, however, isn't at all sure he likes the West, and persuades Travis to take his place--a role Travis is quite willing to assume when he learns that the ranch is being plagued by rustlers headed by one Clay Jackson (Stanley Andrews), whom the Rangers have had on their list for a long time.  Jackson has convinced the honest small cattlemen of the ""breaks"" that the proposed drift fence to be built along Traft's borders will block their cattle from needed water, and a range war is brewing.  Crabbe plays ""Slinger"" Dunn, one of the deceived ranchers, who is better than most with a gun but proves to be an honest man once he learns the truth.  Meanwhile Travis has met Slinger's sister Molly (Katherine deMille), and love blooms, though not (at first) on Molly's side.  This is a B-western with all the faults and strengths of its type, but the fast action and genuine exteriors help to counterbalance the former, and if the women aren't any too attractive (not even Molly), that's probably truer to the reality than the beautiful heroines of higher-budget Westerns.  It's an enjoyable movie with both humor and suspense in about equal measure.",1303171200,,1837,4.8498402555910545
7846133,4,6303427162,"I read the book, Drift Fence, by Zane Grey and was delighted with it.  When I saw there was a movie made from the book, I wanted to see it.  The movie did not follow the book too closely but it was enjoyable, nevertheless.  I am not a Western movie type of fan, but this was my first Zane Grey experience and I was impressed.",1266710400,,325,3.9692307692307693
7846134,4,6303427162,"In this nifty Western, action opens with exciting moments at a rodeo where Jim Traft (comedian Benny Baker) is an onlooker and it is revealed that Traft is to be willed a ranch in Arizona, although he is obviously better suited for city surroundings. At the rodeo Traft is able to make an acquaintance of a wrangler whose name is similar to his, Jim Travis (Tom Keene), who he persuades to swap places with him at the ranch since a codicil in Traft's uncle's will stipulates that his nephew must learn the cattle business. When Travis arrives at the Traft ranch, he quickly impresses the crew there that he is the genuine article, and leads his hands in the construction of a drift fence, to contain his cattle and to keep rustlers and other interlopers off his spread. Successful construction of the fence is endangered by a band of rustlers headed by Clay Jackson (Stanley Andrews) who utilizes the fast draw of local rancher Slinger Dunn (Buster Crabbe) as his primary weapon. Jackson is applying pressure upon Slinger's sister Molly (Katherine DeMille) to wed him, and the grandmother of the siblings (Effie Elssler), matriarchal doyen of the Dunn ranch, approves of Jackson, which complicates matters since Travis (a Texas Ranger in disguise) is familiar with the rustler kingpin's felonious past. Based upon the novel of the same name by Zane Grey, which appeared in serial form two years prior, DRIFT FENCE benefits from the direction of Otho Lovering, a sterling film editor who utilizes fades to perfection, and the viewer feels no need for filler, as the work snaps along to an exciting conclusion. Paramount supplies an enjoyable cast and, in addition to those mentioned, Irving Bacon, Leif Erickson and craggy-faced Walter Long give solid performances. In only 55 minutes of film, this production yields an interesting story and dialogue, augmented by good acting, with comedy, romance and gunplay in the mix.",1126224000,,1921,4.968944099378882
