8541315,5,B001RUJZT4,"Volume 3 is a great DVD.  I actually own all 3 volumes and this one does not disappoint.  I especially like how they teach the history of Visual-Kei.  So I feel like I know more about Visual-Kei than the average person.  Definitely check out Matenrou-opera, Vidoll and Nega in this DVD",1236643200,,285,4.529411764705882
