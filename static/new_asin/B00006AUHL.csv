7966646,5,B00006AUHL,"A superb, difinitive collection of Midnight Oil music video.  All songs are rich is lyric, melody, and message.",1165968000,2,111,5.166666666666667
7966647,5,B00006AUHL,"Midnight Oil turned a new leaf and released this collection of video and live performances which will change your mind about this band.  They are much more inventive and innovative than the few songs by which they are well known in the USA would indicate.  I refer of course to, ""Beds are Burning"" or ""Blue Sky Mining.""  BEDS ARE BURNING was a little confusing due to the expression, burning the midnight oil, but maybe they don't have that saying in Australia.  What they do have there are wild men and lead singer Peter Garrett ranks among them.  He's ominous looking with his shaved (?) bald head, a huge head by the way like the dome of some fabled Ayers Rock, and his take no prisoners expression.  On the other hand he can get quite sentimental sometimes, his voice a whole orchestra of expression, so he's great at the ballad numbers as well as the flat out rockers.

Plus, Midnight Oil has a political side I wouldn't have guessed at before viewing these videos.  Every time they take a position, it's against something or other.  Which is what rock has been about historically, taking up the old leftist positions of folk music.  Wait till you hear Midnight Oil's take on ""US Forces"" for example, from 1983.  The video collection doesn't have this one, but it has almost two dozen other performances, both live and filmed, and one of the live shows is a protest against EXXON delivered right at EXXON headquarters a la U2!  What American band would have the wherewithal to pull that off, not to mention the balls?  It's all ironic since fans of MO call the band ""the Oils,"" and in real life they're in there pitching against our oil-driven society and its hand in pushing war down our throats, and for Garrett's anti-nuke activities (he serves on the board of several Nuclear Disarmament organizations).

He strikes the right note with his weird dancing as though he were in a trance of thought.  Intellectual rock?  Maybe so, at least the Oils know how, and when, to read.  Though Garrett no longer works with the band this collection has him cavorting in every kind of set-up, from the desert heat (and bush hats) of ""The Dead Heart"" at a selection of candid interviews with all the band members and songwriters.",1126656000,6,2223,4.6445012787723785
7966648,5,B00006AUHL,"First and foremost, I wasn't a big Oils fan before purchasing this DVD. So I am not one of those die hard fans that are blinded and would praise the DVD regardless of whether it is 'really' good or not.  This being said...

I am now a HUGE fan of the Oils.

I have not been smitten by a band like this since I saw Stop Making Sense by the Talking Heads.

Don't let the ""I don't know any of their songs"" mentality sway you from this purchase.  As with me, it is likely that you have only heard their one hit in the US, Beds are Burning.  That is the music business today.  Good bands have been replaced by marketing schemes.

Peter Garrett (lead singer) is what I would call one hell of an ""imposing figure"" on stage.  How can you not like this guy?  He reminds me of the dude from the movie The Hills Have Eyes on speed or some kind of frenzy induced drug.  He is remarkable in how he articulates the lyrics... the passsion.  The drive.  The force. The energy. The heart.

BUY THIS DVD...

smack that bad boy in your dvd player...

crank it up...

I said to CRANK IT UP!!!!

That riff is now stuck in my head...

7966650,5,B00006AUHL,"If you are a Midnight oil fan you need this DVD. Great video clips, i was looking for their video clips and just found 2 videos online. beds are burning and the dead hearts. The only song they didn't perform in this Video is my favorite (Warakurna). But still i give them 5 stars they really know how to rock the hose i love to have my beers on saturday watching them play again and again. Get it!! is worth the Bucks ...@!",1066780800,7,423,4.108433734939759
7966651,5,B00006AUHL,"The volume of work in this DVD makes it a great buy compared to other band's DVDs. The 20000watts R.S.L. collection DVD has clips, their production videos and videos which are live song performances. I watched the DVD yesterday with my wife and enjoyed the chance to relive their early video clips. Midnight Oil's raw sound was wonderful and reminded me of the days when I waited up late on weekends to catch them on the U.S.A. channel Night Flight(young MTV rarely showed the alternative bands at that time). If you are recent fan of midnight oil this will give you a broad spectrum of their musical works. I was able to show my daughter the songs she danced to as an 18 month old child (she's 13 now.)My wife still laughs at the way I would try to dance like Peter. I saw them at Red Rocks in 1990 and am happy that they included their live performances for those that have not been at their concerts. Take time to enjoy it for yourself.",1050019200,10,939,4.371428571428571
7966652,5,B00006AUHL,"This is a newly remastered DVD that, until recently, was only available in the PAL format from Australia.  Now, you can enjoy it in all its new found glory here in the USA!  Once you get past the frustratingly confusing selection menu you will be overjoyed to find most of Midnight Oil's conceptual videos, live concert clips, album info, short speaking clips, and a short film set in the Aussie outback with a native Australian  band.  Phew,  have I missed anything?  The video is razor sharp, considering some of the videos were made over 20 years ago, but the audio is spectacular, with its CD-quality sound!  This disc is over three hours long, and it is a bargain.  I wanted more of the Oils' speaking clips, as I found their talk nothing short of fascinating.  Midnight Oil is an impressive band on record, but Peter Garrett is an amazing, imposing performer, and there's no one like him around.  You can't help but after viewing this disc, listening to the music and the Oils'  talk, that they mean what they say, and back it up.  Other artists may seem a bit preachy or insincere, but the Oils'  message really does seem to come from the heart.  Overall, this is a DVD that is a must in any music lover's collection, and a perfect example of how this type of disc should be made!",1036800000,17,1287,4.491379310344827
7966653,5,B00006AUHL,Great collection of Midnight Oil's music videos from TV and live perfomances.  Great sound and imagery make this a worthy buy for 'Oil fans.,1027555200,2,140,4.833333333333333
7966654,5,B00006AUHL,"Great DVD for the Midnight Oil fan.  Includes 19 Midnight Oil Videos (clips as they refer to them down under) Also has the Oil's discussing several videos, Peters run for Senate as well as their involvment in the Clayoquot Sound issue.  Also has 19 Live videos from different concert events.  They even included discussions on playing live, their first album as well as the Exxon protest and several other issues.  Sound and picture is fantastic as everything has been digitally remastered.  Now I'll have to go find my Black Fella, White Fella VHS tape and watch that again as well.  Includes bonus video of Redneck Wonderland.  A must for Oils fans!!",1027468800,4,652,4.81981981981982
