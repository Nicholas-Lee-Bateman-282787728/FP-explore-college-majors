8082601,5,B000B6VHPA,"It's a lot of fun, with a heavy dose of James Bond parody. The lead character and his wife are especially amusing together!

I've been looking for a copy of this for a long time.",1403568000,,178,4.085714285714285
8082602,5,B000B6VHPA,"A hilarious, crazy.. manic journey!  Very tongue in cheek humour and alot of great scenes!  Another star in my collection",1375660800,,121,5.0
8082603,5,B000B6VHPA,"Not only do I like any show that brings me joy and tears, but laughs too.
This film has it for sure. Not the tears but the joy and laughs. Good clean fun. Stephen Chow is on my must watch list. Don't forget he is the one in Kung Fu Hustle another must watch for laughs.",1238112000,3,269,3.8214285714285716
8082604,4,B000B6VHPA,"Forbidden City Cop is a great Wong Jing and Stephen Chow action comedy, with some elements of classic-style ""China kingdom"" drama. When SC was at his peak before he got the big budget roles with added in special effects. The effects are cheap, but the story is great. The actress playing his wife is cute. The emperor hires our bumbling hero to be the head policeman in the Forbidden City to protect the emperor. Bad people are at work trying to make it hard for him. Really funny parts, and overall just very entertaining. Not high art.",1152576000,2,537,4.546391752577319
