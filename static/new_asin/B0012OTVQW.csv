8246939,5,B0012OTVQW,"""5 STARS ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!""  [Actually I'm more for 4.25 stars] Under normal circumstances this should not have gotten, even, 3 -or less-  stars.  But here's the point: The back drops [scenery] was not only ugly but felt filthy.  There were no good props- with possible exception of the meat plant [and that's because it was real].  C. Chase was awful.  Not only were the cast members all fat, their looks were less then bland.
  This would fall into comedy/ inept crime. [keep in mind what I've written above; With that in mind it's like ""DROWNING MONA"" and ""DROP DEAD GEORGIOUS"".] The pace seemed to be fine.  The script was nice and covered everything that needed to be cove [no loose ends].  This leaves
 C-H-A-R-A-C-T-E-R-I-Z-A-T-I-O-N  Fat, unattractive, people, with big flaws.  I cared about, accepted, sympathized with, and wanted to see them make it.  I've seen many big Hollywood movies fail at this.  I enjoyed this movie and say: ""if you're looking to watch a comedy/ inept crime film, that's unusual, or you need to learn about 'characterization' [and you can handle my first paragraph] then you should watch this!""",1387584000,,1138,4.823834196891192

8246941,1,B0012OTVQW,"Wasnt put together well and not funny at all.. Thumbs down for this one. Figured with Chevy Chase it would have been good, but no.",1368748800,,130,4.24
8246942,2,B0012OTVQW,"hello.  Don't usually write up reviews of things I don't like, but was intrigued by the Onion connection, plus Chevy Chase, plus the several positive reviews.  Sadly, for me, it didn't cut it.  Yes, Chase is great, a bit of a curve ball, but he is only in the film for 10 minutes.  The rest of the time, it is the two hapless losers, running around.  I don't think I laughed once.  Maybe a chuckle or two.  It just isn't very good.  I think the last time I didn't dig a ""indie"" piece like this, which had some potential, was the video rental film with Jack Black and Mos Def, just didn't like it, but it was better than this.  The one main actor has a Chris Farley thing going on, but I still didn't think it was good.",1364774400,,718,4.107913669064748
8246943,5,B0012OTVQW,"bad meat is a perfect combination of slapstick and clever humor, mixed together with hilarious topical jokes. if you are a fan of chevy chase, bad meat is the perfect movie for you. hes not in all of the movie, but when hes not, lance and billy make up for it with their comic chemistry that can only be described as explosive. fantastic movie- definitely one to buy!!",1218326400,2,368,4.426470588235294
8246944,4,B0012OTVQW,"I thought the Security Guard was the best actor in the entire film.
He was hilarious!",1214697600,,85,4.375
8246945,5,B0012OTVQW,This is a classic indie comedy. The two main charchters in Bad Meat make the guys from Dumb and Dumber look like Rocket Scientists.,1207699200,3,131,4.5
8246946,5,B0012OTVQW,"Bought this on a whim as I love Chevy Chase.  Well worth it.  I think this is the best thing Chase has done in a long time!  Keep in mind, Chevy isn't in the whole movie but the rest of the cast are also hilarious.  I was in stitches the whole time.  Director Dikkers has out dome himself this time.  I'm a long time fan of the Onion.  If that's your type of humor you're going to love this film.
Enjoy!!",1206748800,4,404,3.9135802469135803
