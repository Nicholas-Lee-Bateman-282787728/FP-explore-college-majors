5796015,4,B00DG86ARK,"The concert visuals are truly outstanding. I would rate this 5 stars had they recorded this in DTS HD Master or even Dolby 5.1
The caliber of the music here really deserves it. A shame not to use all that available BluRay technology.",1379635200,10,233,4.441860465116279
5796016,5,B00DG86ARK,"If you are familiar with Anathema's recent work, you know what to expect with this.

I don't want to give away too many details on the set list to avoid spoilers for people who don't like to know the set list before watching the first time.  Let's just say that you will be happy with the selections if you are a fan of everything they've done from Judgement on.

The performance, production quality, camera angles, venue, etc. are all top notch.  It is great to see Anathema doing well enough in their career at this point to pull off something like this.

Regarding the orchestra, they mostly provides subtle accompaniment.  Don't get me wrong.  The orchestra is there and provides a great addition to Anathema's sound but this isn't like Metallica S&M where the orchestra is very prominent in the mix.

One warning -- it is stereo audio.  There is no 5.1 mix.  I thought this was odd given the production quality otherwise but it is what it is.  The stereo audio sounds great on my system so I'm not complaining.

In short -- this is a must-have for any Anathema fan.",1379635200,5,1070,4.515625
5796017,5,B00DG86ARK,"Great setting, great band, great cinematography, beautiful setting! What more can you ask for? Sound is great and the band is in fine form as well. Orchestra adds depth and texture to the mix filling out the sound nicely. After seeing them live at a local club, which was a dive with horrible acoustics and a terrible house-sound guy, this was a real treat. Just know that there is no 5.1 mix, but the lpcm mix is quite incredible. Also, the concert is 2hrs 20min. Bonus video of an acoustic set performed at the Union chapel adds another dimension, showing that no matter how small the setting, the emotional impact of this soul touching music comes through. Cannot reccomend enough!",1379462400,15,684,4.708333333333333
5796018,5,B00DG86ARK,"Great sound, and visuals.  The bonus performance at the Union Chapel is good as well.",1419465600,,85,4.666666666666667
5796019,4,B00DG86ARK,Well done.,1419120000,,10,4.5
5796020,5,B00DG86ARK,100% FANTASTIC,1415577600,,14,6.5
5796021,5,B00DG86ARK,Anathema aren't everyone's cup of tea but if you are into this sombre type of genre it's worth the buy. The musicians are good at what they do and the production is good to excellent.,1406592000,,183,4.257142857142857
5796022,5,B00DG86ARK,"I never hear Anathema before but i feel the impulse of buy this blu-ray after that i read the numerous reviews that give 5 stars to this concert.
As usual, KSCOPE label only put in the market first quality products (Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree included).
All blu-ray's in my collection of this label are the best picture and sound quality i ever see and listen.
The performance of the band is perfect, the location is AWESOME!!!!!, the roman ruins give a special touch to this concert....oh my god, what a place!
The picture quality is true HD and the sound, only LPCM stereo, is high end without question.
And if you want more, you have a bonus of 5 songs recorded at The Union Chapel.
Fan of Anathema or not, this blu-ray is a excellent choice if you look a great concert.",1401840000,,778,4.4475524475524475
5796023,5,B00DG86ARK,"So, I'm essentially here to convince you to buy this. If you are even a little bit of a fan of the ""Progressive"" metal/rock genre then this is a must own. Anathema absolutely kills it, and I cannot say enough good things about the cinematography from Lasse Hoile, from Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson fame. Each shot is perfect, and you never feel like you aren't looking where you should be. The only black mark on this package is the lack of surround sound, but it packs a near-perfect stereo mix. I could imaging capturing surround sound in an outdoor venue like this would have been a fairly challenging task, but it is still a disappointment it wasn't attempted.

If you are even a bit of a fan of Anathema, you need to see this. It is infinitely better than anything they have ever put out, and is a beautiful representation of them as a band.",1401494400,3,850,4.448717948717949
5796024,5,B00DG86ARK,"Buy it! You won't be dissapointed with these guys! The live show is awesome, vocals are haunting!!  BUY IT AHHH!!",1401321600,,113,4.65
5796025,5,B00DG86ARK,"They're Anathema. They're live.

This concert was AMAZING! I had the opportunity to see them live for myself and I really love that I can pop this in and relive the memories.

Thanks to everyone that made this happen!",1394150400,,217,4.538461538461538
5796026,5,B00DG86ARK,"A lot of people seem dismayed that there is no Dolby 5.1 track on this album.  Let me provide an extremely successful simulation of the 5.1 experience, that in many ways surpasses it:

1)  Watch on a large TV with a good sound system.
2)  Darken room completely.
3)  Smoke an herb of your choice and drink some wine.
4)  Press play and relax for a couple hours.

Trust me, you won't notice and/or care that it's not 5.1.  The video and audio production quality are just fantastic on here...  I'm not sure I've heard many live mixes that are this perfectly well-done.  Highly recommended.",1391212800,2,587,4.504761904761905
5796027,2,B00DG86ARK,Strange. This Blu-ray doesn't come with lossless DTS HD Master; no 5.1 surround sound. Two stars for missing the most essential component in a music concert on Blu-ray.,1388966400,3,168,5.035714285714286
5796028,5,B00DG86ARK,"This is an amazing outdoor live performance. It's a must have for any fan of Anathema.
I saw them live twice. This blu ray captures that same feeling I got when I was in the audience
Get this disc. You will be blown away......AWESOME!",1388793600,,234,4.340909090909091
5796029,4,B00DG86ARK,"From the first songs I knew I was in for a great treat!!!
Never heard them before, this concert was recomended by my son.
Too bad it was not recorded in DTS-HD Master Audio. But anyway in plain stereo is great!!!",1387324800,,212,4.195121951219512
5796030,5,B00DG86ARK,"What a great band, what a sonically beautiful concert.  I love all these songs, but in this concert they just sound so much better.  These guys truly love what they are doing and what they are playing.  The brotherly love that you get from these three, they must of beat on each other when they were younger.  LOL  Just a great show!  I highly recommend this one on Blu-ray!!",1385856000,,375,4.36231884057971
5796031,5,B00DG86ARK,"This is definitely the highlight of their career. I have been a fan since the release of Weather Systems. Like others have said, having the choice of surround sound would have been nice, and they must have had legitimate reasons for not doing so. The stereo track is high quality, and my main rig is 2 channel, so not a real biggie for me.

This makes up for all the terrible youtube videos of the band.....a must-get for anyone who likes Anathema. They are not phenomenal musicians, but have a way of putting together a powerful performance very well. Vocals by Vincent and Lee are heartfelt and spot on. The orchestral backup and locale is terrific, would love to see a concert in an ancient Roman venue! Lasse Hoile always brings out the best in a live show (check out Porcupine Tree's ""Anesthetize"" Blu-ray...now THERE is a masterpiece).",1384732800,,841,4.6824324324324325
5796032,4,B00DG86ARK,"Great concerts to watch, but they should have been in 5.1. Still worth a purchase in my opinion to support Anathema.",1384473600,,116,4.571428571428571
5796033,5,B00DG86ARK,"Brilliant Band with an absolutely brilliant performance.  The venue looks fantastic.  The sound is amazing and the band is spot on.  Anathema is one of those rare bands that can write hauntingly beautiful music with a heaviness that's unparalleled.  They have been on my bucket list to see live for years and have not been able to pull that off.  This Blu-ray will have to do for now.  All I can say is, if you're a fan of Anathema, then you have to own this Blu-ray.  Absolutely fantastic.",1384041600,,490,4.5
5796034,4,B00DG86ARK,"If you are a fan of Anathema, you will love this live concert. If you have never heard of the band before, you may turn it off after the fourth track because it does sound repetitious at times. As for me, I love this concert and the music.",1382918400,,239,4.0
5796035,5,B00DG86ARK,"What an amazing Blu-ray. After a few great studio albums, only a great concert DVD would do. Great visuals, fantastic set list. Amazing! Anathema does it again.",1382140800,2,160,4.962962962962963
5796036,4,B00DG86ARK,"Here we have the 4th concert film by Anathema (Visions Of A Dying Embrace, Were You There?, and A Moment In Time). While technically this is a great blu-ray, the band is not offering us much new on their concert films. The setlists for the last three dvds were almost the same. A Moment In Time offered us rare tracks in the bonus features section such as A Dying Kiss, Sleepless and Albatross. This concert film is by no means bad, in fact, its awesome but it just falls into the same-old same-old category. A few things that could have made this better would have been a 5.1 surround sound option (would have worked well on the wall-of-distortion tracks like Thin AIr), the promo videos for Dreaming LIght and as awful as it was Untouchable. Overall, not a bad blu ray and I would rate it 3.5 stars....just hope for the next one, they offer us something a bit different.",1380240000,2,872,4.45625
5796037,5,B00DG86ARK,"Universal is a concert recording by the British band Anathema, released in 2013 on K Scope records. The concert was shot in support of the band's Weather Systems album at the Ancient Theater of Phillipopolis, Bulgaria on the 22nd of September featuring the Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra. The concert was shot while the band were in support of their Weather Systems album from 2012 and their setlist draws heavily from both it, and the previous two full-length studio albums We're Here Because We're Here and A Natural Disaster.

The performance is of a very high quality, delivering equally well on the energetic sections of songs, and the shimmering, beautiful quiet sections. The astounding vocal trio of Vincent Cavanagh, Daniel Cavanagh and Lee Douglas, both blend and then contrast their vocal styles to great effect, the rest of the musicians deliver everything with both precision and passion and the Orchestra provide color and texture, really filling out the sound.

The mixing job is pretty much perfect and all the instruments are arguably balanced as well as they would be on a studio album, with only the added humanity felt in the vocal and drumming performances giving away that it's a live affair.

The visuals are great, with a tasteful stage show in the beautiful ancient theater, a subtle light show and the Orchestra to draw your eye when the band aren't moving much. The camera work and editing is slow and musician-friendly, letting you get a good look at what people are playing rather than zooming frantically from one shot to another every second.

The track listing for the main show is as follows: `Untouchable Parts 1&2,' `Thin Air,' `Dreaming Light,' `Lightning Song,' `The Storm Before The Calm,' `Everything,' `A Simple Mistake,' `The Beginning And The End,' `Universal,'  `Closer,' `A Natural Disaster,' `Deep,' `One Last Goodbye,' `Flying,' `Fragile Dreams,' `Panic,' `Emotional Winter/Wings Of God,' `Internal Landscapes' `Fragile Dreams (Reprise)'

The bonus feature included is a set of five tracks taken from the stripped down, A Night At The Union Chapel concert, the track listing for which is as follows: `Kingdom' `Thin Air' `Angels Walk Among Us' `A Natural Disaster' `Fragile Dreams.' This feature is similarly well recorded, mixed and edited and no simple throw-away. There are some tracks repeated from the main feature, but their alternative, more unplugged (not completely, but close) style makes it worth having both versions.

The Blu-Ray comes in a slim case with a booklet full of photos and the credits. The visuals are NTSC. The main menu only features play and track selection options, and there are no alternative audio (or subtitle) options which may upset some viewers, however I personally was incredibly happy with the audio provided as standard. There are other editions available, for example on Burning Shed  with more extensive features, such as a CD of the audio, but as a cheap and simple version of the main concert, this edition certainly delivers it.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with this well made and well performed, good looking and good sounding Blu-Ray Anathema concert, and as long as you like the band and don't have an issue with the lack of audio options, or the setlist, then I highly recommend picking up a copy.",1379980800,8,3293,5.094619666048238

I do prefer this concert over the Homecoming Blu-ray just because this concert is excellently produced with the orchestra whereas the Homecoming concert is more of a laid back concert.  Still good, don't get me wrong, but Universal is spectacular by comparison.

I have watched the Blu-ray a number of times already since I received it!!  It is that wonderful!",1459987200,,560,5.0989010989010985
