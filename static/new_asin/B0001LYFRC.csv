2013640,5,B0001LYFRC,"Brilliant, funny, smart, colorful and wise.  This film is a car nut's dream, while at the same time showing the ingenuity of Cubans to make something out of nothing.
The cars are bright and fabuluoso, as are their owners.
After  while you forget the subtitles and just read the old guys faces to find your way around this enlightening documentary about the Big American Cars left in Cuba after the Castro Regime took power.",1185148800,,423,4.702702702702703
2013641,4,B0001LYFRC,"I saw this at Cinequest film festival in San Jose, CA a few years back. It's a great film about the ingenious ways the Cubans keep these beautiful cars running and looking good. I recommend it to any car lover who appreciates the classic value of the 50's American cars.",1175040000,4,270,4.42
2013642,4,B0001LYFRC,"Fortunately politics are left behind to take an endearing look at the

army of homegrown chewing gum and baling wire engineers that keeps Cuba

rolling. Meet the artisans who use chain link fence for welding rods,

and and can refit your cherry Studebaker woody with a Soviet tractor

engine. Suspended between old-fashioned Communism and Yankee freedom

and capitalism, a unique culture not yet lost to Toyotaland.

Recommended for any documentary fan who's ever been or aspired to be a shade tree

mechanic.",1158364800,6,509,5.134146341463414
2013643,5,B0001LYFRC,"I loved this movie so much I <a href=""[...]"">blogged it</a>. Gorgeous shots of urban Cuba and Cubans and the craft of keeping old cars on the road for nearly half a century. The ingenuity and zest of these old dudes will inspire you. The music is great too. Watch a guy make motorcycles out of bicycles and chain saw motors. Watch a guy in a golden Cadillac he's had for 42 years with babes (maybe they're his grand-daughters) grinning in delight. Watch guys squirm when asked, ""would you pick your wife or your car?"" ""My car! You can find another woman later."" ""Both have thirty years with me - it is an equally balanced love.""

More seriously, there's a lot to learn about the way Cubans have adapted to being so isolated and lacking in things we think of as necessities. I hope we would not be too fat and lazy to do the same, if the need arises.",1118880000,9,849,4.339622641509434
2013644,5,B0001LYFRC,"My husband and I got this on dvd from Netflix and found it fascinating--it gives an interesting glimpse into a creative culture. The interviews with various mechanics and seeing their shops and how they maintain these vehicles is great. All together they provide a picture of how they've found a way to work around the scarcity of materials and communism to create a thriving ""underground"" of private repair shops. Don't miss the interview with the producer in the ""extras"". He's a surgeon who has visited Cuba numerous times and his comments added a lot of background to the documentary.",1330992000,,588,4.94949494949495
2013645,5,B0001LYFRC,"A tribute to Cuban ingenuity, in keeping 1930's, 40's and 50's American cars on the road, cars for whom replacement parts have been embargoed by our government for the last 50-odd years.

They're as much a moving landmark as San Francisco's cable cars and Manila's Jeepneys, and I hope that Cuba's eventual move toward free-market economics won't mean that these cars are scrapped.

The end is hilarious, as various Cuban car owners mull a particular question asked by director Schendel.",1327968000,,487,5.075
2013646,5,B0001LYFRC,"This story is just as much about the vintage cars of Cuba as it is about the people who own and repair them.  In that way, it is very much like a love story.  Necessity imposed by the embargo has forced the Cubans to stretch their abilities to not only repair but to manufacture needed parts from scratch!!!

While more satisfying for Spanish speakers, the subtitles and the faces will tell you all you need to know about these dedicated and clever people and their fantastic cars.",1307145600,,481,4.505747126436781
2013647,5,B0001LYFRC,"This is a great little movie about the 1950's American cars stranded in Cuba after the embargo, their owners, and the mechanics who keep them running and on the road.  Beautiful photography, really great music, even hip hop and rap music that the younger people would love.  To sum up in one word what this movie does is this movie SHINES.  Gleaming Chrome, polished cars, sparkling cars in the sun, colorful people, friendly people, and a wonderful country that still has so much potential if only the embargo hadn't been imposed.  There is such a rich culture and people do the best they can in very hard, poor circumstances while living in the past.  This is a great movie and goes along well with the movie Buena Vista Social Club.",1283644800,,735,4.623076923076923
2013648,1,B0001LYFRC,"I was looking forward to buying this but then I saw it on netflix and I was disappointed,instead of being apolitical on focusing on the beautiful cars we have basically a documentary on cars and on how the embargo should be lifted,then you have a non-Cuban(South American/Central American or Mexican) Interviewer asking mundane and silly questions as if a Cuban would dare speak out against Castro Inside Cuba! it even starts bad with ""in 1959,The brutal regime of Batista"" to that effect, Brutal Dictatorship to another even More brutal. then the non Cuban Hispanic poses a Question ""So you operating your own business Inside a Socialist Country""? How can one operate anything as one said they do pay taxes,Cuba is not a Utopia,it used to be beautiful,it has beautiful women,cars and Now not because of an embargo but a tyrant,These cars are what you have,but look for yourself and you will see miserable people behind the smiles. (there are very few who are enablers.)and Yes The Cuban is an inventor,but to showcase cars and then have an anti-embargo message with Pro Castro Leanings,Sorry I wanted to see cars not more of the same utopia myths.",1279238400,2,1148,4.892307692307693

2013650,4,B0001LYFRC,"Written and produced by two friends, and reviewed once upon a time by Jay Leno.  While a little dated now, really not much has changed in Cuba and the story is just an amazing slice of life about Cubans and their 1950's time warp and love of big American cars.  The love of cars has no political boundary.",1259712000,2,305,4.241379310344827
2013651,5,B0001LYFRC,this is a great video.  it deserves more attention.  it's a top american-made documentary.  dealing w/ amazon was a pleasure.,1234742400,,125,5.15
2013652,5,B0001LYFRC,"What a neat one to watch! A true throw-back to the 50s/70s. While it is sad to know that the owners of these cars cannot (yet) get either parts for their classics or recognition for keeping them alive, it also shows the creative spirit of the Cuban people... and the music of the video is awesome as well.",1205798400,2,305,4.275862068965517
2013653,5,B0001LYFRC,"Initially I purchased this for myself, then for several friends.  It shows wonderful scenes of Cuba, and also shows the creativity and resourcefulness of people who love cars, and what they do to keep them going.  It's an insight into the wink wink of living under communism.  I recommend this to car enthusiasts, and to those wondering what life in Cuba, in some regards is like.  Excellent.",1198368000,,392,4.8059701492537314
8014361,5,B0001LYFRC,The lengths that Cubans go through to keep their 50's era cars running is nothing short of amazing.  Making their own trim pieces or brake shoes along with scavenging industrial or other odd engines to replace worn out originals shows a level of ingenuity rarely seen any more.  Hats off to them and thanks for a very entertaining and educating video.,1481673600,,351,4.737704918032787

8014367,5,B0001LYFRC,Shows how much fun one can have when the US tries to ignore you.  Some day the world will look back at the resourcefulness of the Cuban people and learn how to fix things themselves.,1416009600,,182,4.2
8014368,5,B0001LYFRC,"This is a very informational and entertaining film.  It shows how the Cubans make do when socialism causes shortages and unavailability of parts.

I have watched it several times already",1391731200,,186,5.166666666666667
8014369,5,B0001LYFRC,Very entertaining dvd about the Cuban people and their persistence in keeping up their American cars.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in restoring cars or for anyone who is interested in seeing how they recycle materials to make new parts.  The Cuban people are both inventive and amazingly resilient.,1388966400,,314,5.137254901960785
8014370,4,B0001LYFRC,"I had watched Yank Tanks on Netflix several times and when it was no longer available, I ordered it for my video library. I'm somewhat let down because the Netflix version was much wider on my HDTV screen. The DVD shows up really narrow on my TV and it actually covers only about half of the screen.",1374969600,,299,4.2631578947368425
