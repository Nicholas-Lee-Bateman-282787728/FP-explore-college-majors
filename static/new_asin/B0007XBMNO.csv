2248744,2,B0007XBMNO,"I can't figure out how Rudy has gotten the mileage he's gotten. I think I've watched all of his videos (heck, at some point, you've seen everything else), and I have found him to be consistently, extraordinarily, shallow in his research, and in his understanding of his subject countries and locales. Please understand, I say that in the context of knowing many of his destinations, in some cases quite well.

If you want a light, fluffy, skim of the region, Rudy is your man -- he never covers anything that you wouldn't know about if you gave nine minutes to absent-mindledly flipping through a competent guidebook... and in the same depth. Think of Rudy as a tour bus, passing through at twenty miles an hour, giving you a glimpse, but never quite stopping to let you smell the roses. Or the horse manure. Lite, cheerful, sanitized, smooth, and lo-cal.

For a basic introduction to a country or region, Rick Steves is a better resource, whether or not you are seeking bargain travel -- look especially to Rick for help with building and prioritizing a trip around available time, and for help findingnice little spots the big books may overlook. If you want more than Rick offers, you'll have to start working your way through rather more serious volumes. Rudy ain't it.

On a positive note, the pictures aren't ugly. If your library has nothing else, and if you've seen everything else on Netflix, you probably won't regret the money invested.  On the other hand, if you've already been to the destination, you may well be asking, ""Why, Rudy, why? It would have been so easy to do a much better job.""

Two stars.  The subject matter, regardless of its treatment, doesn't allow me to go lower.",1163462400,8,1696,4.712837837837838

8053486,3,B0007XBMNO,"Rick Steves is an expert on all things Europe (too bad he won't go to any other continent). Rick is a nerd who clearly loves his job. Rudy Maxa, on the other hand, seems like he is just going through the motions. The only Rudy Maxa episode I enjoyed was the Japan episode.

In this DVD, Rudy went to all of the touristy sites in Paris (Notre Dame, Latin Quarter, Arc De Triomphe). He passed by the Louvre, but he didn't actually go inside. The Paris episode felt rushed.

I also saw the French Riviera episode. There were some hot French women, but overall, I didn't really enjoy it.

Rick Steve's France DVD is MUCH better than this.",1375056000,,634,4.3559322033898304
8053487,5,B0007XBMNO,"Always so enjoyable to watch his program, so much so that we wanted to be able to review his travels whenever the mood hit us. His style and persona make it seem like your travels are going to be rich and rewarding but also you can gain the confidence to make it so.",1364083200,,266,4.037735849056604
8053488,5,B0007XBMNO,Just came back from Paris and this video is good enough for people like me to enjoy it. His introductions are brief but it is enough to bring up my curiosity to expolre more. To get into the details I would read the books. It's nice to introduce the lovely port of Cassis and the shore line of Les Calanques. Provence & The Cote D'Azur by DK is the good book I have.,1275782400,,366,4.027397260273973
8053489,2,B0007XBMNO,This DVD is a repackaged/remixed version of his other two France travel DVDs. I was disappointed to see the exact episodes that we already have under different titles.,1261526400,,167,5.0
8053490,5,B0007XBMNO,"I rented this from the library. I haven't been to France yet but I have seen a few videos on it. This is one of the more enjoyable ones. I actually did learn a few things on the areas including some history on them. The scenery was breathtaking. I like how the regions are divided into separate shows or parts. You can watch just one in a sitting if you prefer. I like how he prefers to stay as a local too, and get the local view on things. A very enjoyable way to spend a few hours!
I will be buying this one to watch at leisure.",1234656000,,531,3.925925925925926
8053491,4,B0007XBMNO,"After reading the ""bad"" review here - I ordered it anyway because of the reduced price and the quality of Rudy's PBS programs. I have been to Paris many times and have spent days driving through the French country side from Paris to Nice to Les Alps and Alsace.

I was pleased I ignored the ""bad"" advice. This is a very nice video which should help anyone remember their trip to France.

Value and quality - very good - tres bon!",1218931200,,429,4.283950617283951
