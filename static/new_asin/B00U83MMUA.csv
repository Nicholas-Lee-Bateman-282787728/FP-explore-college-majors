8704645,4,B00U83MMUA,"The first part of this DVD was directed by John Holmes in 1977. He is neither a director nor an actor, since John's lines are delivered in a monotone. He has sex with some women and other than having a huge dick, the action is boring. Part II is directed by Carlos Tobalina, in 1982, and there is a bit more animation. The plot revolves around a perfume that John discovers that turns everyone into rutting animals. (There is no expiration date on the perfume, because he finds it in an antique shop.)  All people have to do is take a sniff and they drop their pants. The women in this film are mostly unknowns, but cute in a nice way. There is very little lesbian action, but tons of fellatio which woman might enjoy. The first part ends too abruptly and we never see the beautiful psychologist again. The video quality is OK, not grainy.",1529539200,,839,4.378205128205129

8704651,5,B00U83MMUA,"A movie and its sequel (conclusion?), on one DVD.  The film quality is therefore reduced because of compression, but it's still pretty good.  The colors and sounds are there, even with some expected graininess.

John Holmes is not a great actor, but his acting skills aren't front-and-center for most of the film.  He isn't terrible, though, for the vaudevillian nature of the material.  The story itself is actually kind of creative.  It flashes back and forth between Casanova (as well as Don Juan) and his many-generations descendant.  At its root, of course, it is all about the coupling, and that is frequent and at length.  It's a throwback to a much different attitude toward adult film; compared to today's adult film studios, it's more creative and professional outside the bedroom, and less refined and sterile in the bedroom.",1433462400,7,836,5.007246376811594
