7800037,1,1598034936,"Antiquated science!  Funny how fast the ""facts"" change.  Wouldn't spend for it again.  If you want this, barrow it from the library...by the time you return it, the current science will be on DVD.  The arrogance is astounding.  Dave in Colorado",1432857600,2,244,4.853658536585366
7800038,5,1598034936,"Outstanding!  Professor Whittle has nailed it.  I read/listen to many science lectures including many on the Big Bang.  This course increased my understanding by manyfold.  I followed his advice and listened twice to difficult passages. Well worth the effort.
 I almost never give 5 star ratings.  In this case I was looking for the 6th star.",1428451200,,342,5.017857142857143
7800039,5,1598034936,Excellent all the way around. I would buy from them again. Very satisfied overall.,1414713600,,82,4.928571428571429
7800040,5,1598034936,"I borrowed this from a friend but am ordering my own copy. I have watched several episodes over again since they are tough going in places, and I have a PhD physics and spent 40 years doing research in particle physics and astrophysics, although not cosmology. But I am writing a book on the history of cosmology, the multiverse and the connection with theology, so this was just what I needed.

That doesn't mean you have to have a PhD to get a lot out of these lectures. The graphics are wonderful along with simulations of sounds of the early universe. Whittle is a great lecturer as well as a great explainer. You will learn a lot from this, guaranteed. And, lastly, the subject is the most exciting in science today.",1368316800,6,721,4.5038167938931295
7800041,5,1598034936,Interested in subject.  Course is a little deep and not for the casual interest person.  Takes 16 hours of video and another 10 hours or so of reading the accompanying text.,1366416000,5,173,4.548387096774194
