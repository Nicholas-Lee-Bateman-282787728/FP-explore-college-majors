8180282,5,B000NOKM7E,This is a Discovery production not BBC Earth production in the same name. This is more about the locations than the hunters or individual who hunt or push the limit in those locations. It is very informative and well done video since you will be able to explore some eight locations of the Blue Planet. Bravo.,1447977600,,309,4.535714285714286
8180283,3,B000NOKM7E,"Beautifully photographed video of some of the Earth's most stunning places, but burdened with melodramatic narration and music. My biggest objection was that ALL the human interest stories connected with these places are about men and/or boys. Women and girls are rarely seen, even in the background. Unacceptable   and disappointing, considering the source of the series.",1447804800,,372,5.625
8180284,5,B000NOKM7E,"Check out the number of the reviews on any of the BBC EARTH series documentaries and you will see thousands of votes. It is not amazing since BBC EARTH comes with cinematography out of this world. This series is about the most challenging locations on planet earth and humans who take on such challenges by exploring its resources for food, fun or more importantly addressing the natural world that comes with different species specific to those locations. One of a kind, full of action documentary that you will be glued every second of the documentary to the monitor. A must see, high quality production. Bravo, bravo, bravo.

Episode 1 | Extreme Wonders
1. CENDERWASIH BAY, NEW GUINEA, in north of Australia where natives go to catch enough fish to raise enough money to make a generous gift to their girlfriends parents before marriage.
2. MOUNT EVEREST, where sherpas have to set the dangerous trails in Khumbu Icefall.
3. KILIMANJARO MOUNTAIN, TANZANIA, AFRICA where farmers battle with elephants at the slopes since the survival of the Massai trisbepeple of the village of nearby Tinga-Tinga depends on a yearly crop of maize. Unfortunately other species need to eat and survive and in this case hundreds of elephants that siege those precious fields of maze. As darkness falls, elephants try to move in and start eating those crops. If those elephants are not stopped, the village can starve. Since elephant numbers are in decline, the only thing that those farmers can do is to frighten the elephants since anyone harming them will face prison.
4. GRAND CANYON, USA where conservationists try to ensure a condor chicks survival. Now, compare the Africans above at the slopes of Kilimanjaro to __some of__ the hunters around Grand Canyon and California where they use lead bullets just like the majority of hunters in the US. Condor, the largest bird in North America where there is only 72 left are in danger of extinction due to the lead poisonings from lead bullets. Here are two countries where one is considered a super power and civilized with some citizens who pay for permit to kill wildlife in the name of sport as well as killing other species knowingly or unknowingly due to their lead bullets in the name of fun while the Massai tribepeople do everything possible to protect life even if that may including starvation since elephant will raid their maize crop, their only source of food. It seems ironic that civilized hunters can not simply comprehend the fact that they can continue their sport by simply using non-lead bullets that can protect many other species that they are not there to hunt. Forward a copy of this DVD to the governors of those disgraceful states as well as NRA.

Episode 2 | Wonders of Water
1. VICTORIA FALLS, ZAMBIA, AFRICA where men risk death to reach fishing pools to catch fish to feed their families.
2. CAMARGUE, FRANCE where 18 year old boys face wild bulls captured from the last secluded salt marshes. Those wild bulls are smaller, faster and faster than other breeds.
3. AMAZON RIVER, BRAZIL where men fish for pirarucu once a year for a short season which can pay for a whole year of living.
4. RAJA AMPAT ARCHIPELAGO, NEW GUINEA where there is more fish than Australias Great Barrier Reef and Bahamas put together, a guardian seeks a manta ray to help save the species since because of the distasteful Chinese species who pay $200 a pound to use it as medicine. Manta rays have very few young, one every six years and more are currently being slaughtered than born. Here is a native who is trying to tag a pregnant manta ray for the future of his kids but those Chinese will kill anything in the name of medicine, the same disgraceful way that they kill tigers, rhinos, elephants and marine mammals in the name of medicine.",1446681600,,3782,4.763719512195122
8180285,5,B000NOKM7E,"This nature documentary covers a lot in a little time, but the quality and focus of information is extraordinary.  Angel Falls coverage is spectacular with a bit of indigenous and western history.  The Sahara Desert is discussed in acceptable detail while the narrator shows us the people who live there and how they survive.  A very educational series of compressed subject segments that are interestingly presented, considering the time duration of the dvd.  Below is a list of the above dvd and the part 2 sequel, which I don't believe is out yet.  Hopefully, the Discovery Channel will make part 2 available soon, as it is just as enjoyable as the first.

8180286,5,B000NOKM7E,"This DVD is perfect for teachers.  Each segment is about 15 minutes.  Hopefully, the Travel Channel will be putting more episodes on DVD soon.",1251763200,2,142,4.875
