6160706,5,B00HF0N776,"This is a great, wholesome family movie. It has family bonds spanning several generations, it has teenagers learning to love more than their cell phones or iPods and, most importantly, it has adorable dogs doing adorable things. It's safe fun you can enjoy around Grandma and the kids, and even the teens will appreciate the cuteness of fluffy canines.",1412899200,,352,4.983050847457627
6160707,5,B00HF0N776,"This is a fun, wholesome movie that any generation can watch together. Teen girls will like it because of Cody Linley. Teen boys will like it because of Dora Madison Burge.  Adults will like it because of Lance Henriksen. Lance freakin' Henriksen!  Cowboys will like it because of Texas. Everyone will like it because of the dogs. And grandparents will love to watch this with their grandchildren because there is no vulgar language.  Unless you think ""poop"" is vulgar.  If you do, DON'T watch this movie!  I repeat, DO NOT watch this movie if you're offended by the word ""poop!""  Otherwise, this movie is for you!",1410134400,3,614,4.745283018867925
