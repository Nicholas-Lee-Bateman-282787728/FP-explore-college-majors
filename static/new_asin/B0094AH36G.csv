8535658,1,B0094AH36G,"I watched this complete on YouTube and in spite of the problems with the vocalists' singing decided to buy it for one reason.
I wanted to complete my Verdi opera collection on DVD and Bluray.
However I can't recommend it. The singing is just average. Moreover, Junko Saito, Alzira , is completely wild in her top notes.
Same for the baritone who plays Gusmano. On the promising side it is complete with both verses of cabalettas and though this is not great Verdi
it still is Verdi and the music is enjoyable.",1503619200,,509,4.543478260869565
8535659,3,B0094AH36G,"If one is bound and determined to collect the complete Verdi operas on video, Alzira will provide the greatest challenge.  There are only two Alziras on DVD:  this one, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/one-from-Parma/dp/B00A8MGJ1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">one from Parma</a>.  Both are strangely expensive, and neither is very good.

This one is a concert performance, meaning no scenery and no costumes--the performers just wear their evening attire and sing in front of the orchestra.  The Parma performance, however, is fully-staged with more-or-less-traditional scenery and costumes.

So, the Parma video should win hands-down, correct?  No, it's nowhere near that simple.  The Parma production has the look and feel of a crummy junior college production--but far worse is its engineering.  It's so poorly lit, and so poorly recorded, it's simply a horrible chore to sit through.

This concert performance, on the other hand, is well-lit and very well recorded, both video and audio.  The orchestra and chorus are also more proficient than the other.  OK, how about the soloists?  Well ... I would have to give the nod to the Parma group for their soloists.

So it's not altogether clear-cut.  The only thing I can say with certainty is that neither is satisfying.  I really couldn't recommend either.  But, if forced at gunpoint ... I suppose I'd have to say this is a little tiny bit preferable since at least one can see and hear everything.

Alzira does have several good audio-only recordings (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this/dp/B0000799GS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this/dp/B000028AX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this/dp/B0018ODSYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this</a>), any of which I'd recommend far above the currently-available videos.

(But how I'd love to see and hear a well-designed and engineered production of Alzira on DVD ... just think of it, a Verdi opera set among the Incas!  :-)",1430524800,3,2166,6.454861111111111
8535660,4,B0094AH36G,"This is Verdi's least performed opera, but make no mistake, there is some really fine music in it, although the plot is thin. The performance here is semi-concertant, that is, the singers do some acting, although there is no stage director, no costumes or no sets. Because of the thin plot, it is probably no great loss. The main singers are good, if not great. The orchestra and the chorus also do a great job. The conducting lies in the safe hands of Gustav Kuhn.

8535662,3,B0094AH36G,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

Picture is fine. You need to go into the sub-menu of your player to elect surround sound.

Sound is DTS-HD MA 5.1. I have listened to it now twice and settled on a -7 db setting on my receiver, which is rather high for me. (C Major blu-rays seem to need more amplification than other labels, Beethoven's 9 symphonies need -8 db.)
As you can see from the title picture, it is a performance on  stage with the orchestra behind the principals and the chorus behind the orchestra  At that -7 db setting, the voices reach about 80 db and are a bit louder than the orchestra, chorus is further subdued. The recording does give you good stage depth with the voices out front, the orchestra in the middle and the chorus behind. Increasing the loudness will give you a better sounding orchestra and chorus, but the voices will then often reach above 85 db and will be too loud for me.
The sound stage at that setting extents about 2-3 feet beyond the front corner speakers or reaches about 80 degrees. Better than stereo, but not by much. Orchestra is recorded o. k., but it is not very detailed or enveloping. Voices are from the center only and recorded with body mics so they are quite clear. Applause is from the front. Overall, it gives you the impression of sitting somewhere in row 9 or10.
It is an average recording with nothing really wrong, but nothing great either, so three stars for the audio.

As for the performance, I don't mind the format with a simple stage and no big ""theater"" overhead. It enables performances in smaller cities like this one and might get more people to see a live performance at reasonable prices. Lesser known operas can be performed that we might otherwise never hear. The principals can still act and I thought most did quite well here.
All  voices were fine to acceptable with the exception of  the soprano Junko Saito. For my ears, it is just not a nice voice. There is a 3 minute clip on youtube with her in a duet with von Bothmer that Naxos posted. You get a short sampling of her voice. There is probably a reason why there are no other clips of her singing.
As far as I know there is no alternative to this performance so you will have to decide whether you can live with that voice.",1364774400,3,2663,4.433537832310838
8535663,5,B0094AH36G,"In ""Verdi With A Vengeance"" (required reading!), author William Berger notes that second rate Verdi is better than most anything else and I agree. I have been a Verdiholic since late high school, which was a LONG time ago; it was a time when just a handful of the maestro's works were performed, and those were substantially cut (all those trashy cabalettas, don't ya know!).

Now, all of Verdi's works are available on CD, and C Major is making sure that all are availble on DVD as well, in this bicentennial of Verdi's birth year.

Alzira is widely regarded as Verdi's worst opera, not because of the music, which is full of melody and vitality, but because of the story, which Verdi never seemed to care much about (""Quella e proprio brutta"" was his later comment).

But the music is a never ending cascade of melody, much of it very energetic, and a concert performance may well be its best venue, to avoid the negativity of faulty dramatics.

All of the singers do well, with special ""Braavi!!"" to soprano Junko Saito (Alzira),tenor Ferdinand Von Bothmer (Zamoro) and baritone Thomas Gazheli (Gusmano). Von Bothmer was particularly noteworthy with a vibrant tone and extended range. The orchestra and chorus under the baton of Gustav Kuhn did fine work wth the score, which appears to be uncut.

Picture and sound are first rate. When folks ask why I buy DVDs of operas we own on CD, I just fire up the system and let them hear the DTS version as opposed to the straight stereo one. Conversion follows.

So, gentle reader, buy this with confidence, especially if you like Verdi's music, because there is a lot to like in Alzira whether or not Verdi's ""proprio brutta"" comment is valid.",1360540800,5,1690,4.6925675675675675
8535664,5,B0094AH36G,"Es una  Opera un tanto rara, no muy difundida. Esta llena de muy lindas melodas. Si bien es cierto que no tiene actuacin, pero las voces en general son excelentes y el coro tambin. Muy recomendable!!

8535665,5,B0094AH36G,"I totally disagree with the previous reviewer.  This was a very good concert performance of the opera.  All the singers were excellent in their respective roles.  The chorus was excellent and the opera itself is most enjoyable.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it and seeing it.  The acting was quite good for a concert performance.  I liked the introduction to the opera for its summary of the story and information on the opera itself.  I recommend this Verdi rarity for all who enjoy the music of Verdi.

8535666,2,B0094AH36G,"According to the introduction to the opera on this blu-ray Alzira is Verdi's least popular opera and ranks 1445 among all performed operas, between Verdi's Aroldo (1444), Wagner's Die Feen (1446) and Rossi's Cleopatra (1447). According to that same introduction, Verdi wrote to his friend Andrea Maffei after he completed it, that ""I composed it almost without thinking and with no trouble whatsoever"" - it actually sounds to me like something he could have written in his sleep. There are those who find many fine passages in it. I did not enjoy any of it. Verdi famously commented on it eventually ""Quella  proprio brutta"" - this one is really gross - I couldn't agree more. The plot hinges on a trite love triangle. This issue was compiled from two concert performances that took place in September 2012 in the impressive Gustav Mahler Saal in Toblach, South Tyrol in northern Italy.

Conductor Gustav Kuhn and the orchestra did all they could for the work with a brilliant, charismatic and enthusiastic accompaniment, chorus included. The last time this opera was performed in Italy was 10 years ago as part of the Verdi Festival, conducted by Bruno Bartoletti, with Paoletta Marrocu as Alzira. Here soprano Junko Saito in the title role has a shrill, unattractive, unsteady sound, with a weak top and bottom (and center). She sometimes resorts to pushing and shrieking above the staff, has no sense of style, loses power at times, no trills, unsteady piano, forte and mezza voce. She often sings flat (except when she sings sharp above the staff). She displays little character in her singing. Her diction is unclear and on occasion she exchanges consonants. When struggling with the role's more challenging parts she looks as if someone is twisting a knife in her guts and pouring acid on her face.

Tenor Ferdinand von Bothmer is forever enshrined in my Tenor Hall of Fame for his role as Roderigo di Dhu in the 2006 recording of La donna del lago under Zedda on Naxos. Roderigo di Dhu is a crazy Nozzary role, i.e., it goes from baritone bottom to tenor top and requires power, stamina and extreme agility. It is said that there are no singers today who can do justice to these roles, and when a singer is up to the task the trade off is usually in an unpleasant timbre. Ferdinand von Bothmer's abilities are nothing short of a miracle. He has a beautiful, lyric timbre, ardent and passionate delivery, an endless range with a real, secure bottom, ringing top and no breaks. His agility is insane; there is nothing he can't do. Here the lover role of Zamoro doesn't allow him to show off all he can, but his performance is the best in the cast. He is best in difficult passagework, but his tone is always plush, has enough power and his delivery is involved, attractive and virile. Sometimes a German accent shows through and at one point he declaimed (IIRC) ""shprezzare"" instead of ""sprezzare"".

The biggest role here is not the title role but that of Gusman, the bad guy in the love triangle. It is difficult to review the performance of baritone Thomas Gazheli here. He now sings mostly heldenbaritone roles and there are numerous examples of his superb musicianship in the German repertoire, and well-projected, big sound. Here, however any assessment of his performance is colored and marred by his concert stage deportment. He looks as if he is struggling with a giant who is sitting on him and tries to strangle him, or alternatively like he is about to vomit: horrible facial contortions, an epileptic posture with unsteady gait... I can't trust my judgment when the visual part is so distracting, but I think he sounds obstructed and forced. When he insists on not taking a breath for several bars (legato) he sounds like he is struggling. And yet when I tried to listen with my eyes away from the screen the sound was pretty impressive, good solid tone - but a Verdi baritone he ain't.

In the service of clean visuals no microphone stands are seen on stage - the singers wear lapel mics and the conductor stands deeper into the stage than the singers, who can move around freely. They follow his baton from two TV monitors placed facing them on two front row seats. I noticed that performances where the singers are body miked sound better on headphones. The advantage of good speakers over even the best headphones is the soundstage they provide, but body mics kill the soundstage anyway. Sound engineers deconstruct the sound to a gazillion tracks and reconstruct some artificial mix according to their skills, preferences and available time. With body mics the result is sterile. This is another example of the maxim that the more toys sound engineers have available to play with the worse the outcome.

Overall, watching this performance (twice) was a torture.",1358035200,11,4783,4.805589307411908
