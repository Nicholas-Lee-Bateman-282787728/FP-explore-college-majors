8409275,2,B003YHB7KI,"I am a professor of special education and bought this as support for teaching co-teaching.  It is moderately amusing, but technically lacking.  Clearly, as the title implies, the film itself is Improv.  They didn't plan the examples used to correlate acting improv to co-teaching.  There is a lot of stumbling around as she tries to think of examples, and decide how to proceed.  The main ideas related to building a solid co-teaching relationship are fine, but they are not well executed in the 30 minute film.  It might be interesting for a teacher who is already co-teaching and experiencing resistance in an uncomfortable pairing.  There is no insight into HOW to co-teach, HOW to divide the content, the MODELS of co-teaching.  It's all about breaking the emotional resistance between co-teaching colleagues, which is not enough content to merit the cost.",1359849600,2,860,5.0928571428571425
