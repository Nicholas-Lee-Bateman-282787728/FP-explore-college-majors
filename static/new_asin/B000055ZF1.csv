1394538,5,B000055ZF1,Who wouldnt love a sci-fi cheeze movie....! (anyone ever notice that this ship has appeared in other sci-fi movies / tv shows as well?).,1011312000,2,136,4.708333333333333

And it's reissue in DVD was the major reason (aside from price) that we finally got a DVD player for ourselves this Christmas.
This was the most expensive film Corman had made up until then, but i understand it paid off quite well for him -- partially because he built his own special effects unit (instead of conracting out to others) and then made his money back doing special effects for *other* low budget film makers.
Sayles's script, Horner's score, Cameron's art direction -- all have been mentioned, and all are/were top-notch, lifting this film well above the level one might expect it to reach.
I *almost* gave this five stars, but i have to agree with an earlier reviewer who mentioned the less-than-pristine print used for this disk; it's acceptable, but i could wish for better.  Sound is good, though, and Horner's score is still as stirring as ever.

1394541,5,B000055ZF1,"We are proud to announce a new science fiction epic starring John Saxon, Robert Vaughn and George Peppard, from a script by John Sayles, with music by James Horner, visual effects and design by James Cameron and produced by Gale Anne Hurd!  We are pleased to present...
ROGER CORMAN'S ""Battle Beyond the Stars"".
That's right, with such an array of talent, if it isn't a major studio financed blockbuster, it must be a Roger Corman film.  More than almost any other producer/director in Hollywood history, Corman is famous for giving the extraordinary talents of today their first big breaks.  That's the case here, where a young John Sayles, James Horner and Jim Cameron are allowed to cut their teeth on Corman's attempt to cash in on the ""Star Wars"" craze of the late '70s.
Each person does their part, too, making ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" into another of the nearly endless list of clever, spartan Corman productions that enjoy cult status today.  Sayles shows both his wit and supurb writing style by adapting the ""Seven Samurai"" formula into a pared down hour and a half version.  To accomplish this, he infuses the script with a strong sense of parody and humor, allowing the film to transcend as a comic adventure instead of morality play (as SS and The Magnificent Seven were before it).  Cameron's designs and effects look pretty good, considering the notoriously typical small Corman budget he had to work with.  Despite his accomplishments in this film, it could be said, given his controversial budgets for Terminator 2 and Titanic, that he prefers money not be an issue!  Finally, James Horner gave himself the gift that kept on giving, producing the score that would find itself lovingly included in so many future Horner works.
With a wry script, breezy pace, enjoyable characters, comfortably familiar score, and well-done visuals, ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" is the proverbial Must for any sci-fi and cult film fan.",990057600,6,1931,4.938271604938271
1394542,3,B000055ZF1,"Actually, I don't disagree with most of the comments. The extras are great (especially the commentary, although Gale Anne Hurd has a tendency, at least in the beginning, to drop little nuggets of information without any context), and it's great to have this film in widescreen HOWEVER, whomever was raving about the transfer need to wipe the dust off of their TV! It's not that it's bad, it's too good. So good that you can see every scratch and fleck of dust on whatever lousy 21-year-old print they used to master this puppy. If they were going to put in the time to make this disc, at least they could have struck a new print for the transfer.",989539200,16,646,4.483050847457627
1394543,3,B000055ZF1,"James Cameron, Gale Ann Hurd , James Horner names sound familar. Well they all did work on a little film called ALIENS. Get Roger Corman to throw in John Sayles a brilliant independent filmaker and script doctor and you have a pretty talented crew.  Just released to DVD, this low budget space epic capitalized on the STAR WARS craze of the late 70's...with effects that were used in numerous other Roger Corman productions, this film actually had some quality....Its basically the magnificent 7 in space with Robert Vaughn recreating the same role he played in the original. Lots of fun, this will bring back good memories for those who saw it the first time around. The features really add a lot...Lots of commentary....Roger Corman is worth listing to. Known as perhaps the greatest low budget filmaker of all time (just check his list of credits produced over 300 films and directed another 50)...his book ""How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood (And Never Lost a Dime)"" is classic.",984009600,3,988,4.846153846153846
1394544,4,B000055ZF1,"Great memories accompany this movie for me, thankfully the producers of this DVD have honored this production with a jam-packed feature full of special features.  I was not even a teenager when this movie was released back in 1980 yet a group of friends and I made the pilgrimage to a local cinema to see it. With an interesting set of diverse characters the movie plays as a science fiction version of the Seven Samurai. A ""Magnificent Seven in Space"" as it were, it even features Robert Vaughn of that 60s gem.  The real pleasure of the DVD however is the wealth of special features. We not only have one optional audio commentary, but two very informative pieces. There are preview trailers for other Corman productions such as ""Piranha"". We even get a trivia game.  I certainly recommend this movie.",982540800,22,803,4.7214285714285715
1394545,4,B000055ZF1,"Would you believe a spaceship with breasts?  There's one in this 1980 Roger Corman space opera!  The spaceship has a female computer personality named Nell and a decidedly feminine shape, which includes two enormous breast-like mounds on its underside.  Since there is no nudity in this movie, which is unusual in a Corman film, he had to get the breasts in somewhere, so model designer/builder/art director James Cameron put them on the space craft!  Very amusing indeed!  Cameron went on to design bigger and better things, like the Titanic.
Battle Beyond the Stars was the biggest-budgeted movie Corman had ever made up to that time, about 2 million dollars, and his money is up there on the screen, with good sets, good props, good special effects, and a good cast.  In typical Corman fashion everything except the cast was used over and over again in other space sagas he made.  Waste not, want not! is his credo, and he boasts that he's never lost a dime on any of his movies.  I believe it.
The plot of this movie was stolen shamelessly from Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai, so if you liked that Japanese epic and its American remake, The Magnificent Seven, you should like Battle Beyond the Stars, too.  It just goes to show that if you have to steal a story, you might as well steal a great one!
The cast includes Richard Thomas, just out of his John-Boy of The Waltons role, as a poor man's Luke Skywalker recruiting mercenaries George Peppard, Robert Vaughn, Marta Kristen, and Sybil Danning, among others, to fight the evil conqueror Sador, played by John Saxon, always a good villain.
Never one to miss a trend, or start one, Corman cashed in on the phenomenal success of Star Wars with Battle Beyond the Stars.  It's a fun film and I recommend this DVD widescreen edition.  There's interesting commentaries by Gale Anne Hurd, John Sayles and Roger Corman, movie trailers, biographies, trivia game, scene index -- but the usual Corman filmography booklet is absent here.",982022400,60,1990,4.7894736842105265
1394546,5,B000055ZF1,"With the Empire Strikes Back, Flash Gordon and this film, 1980 was a huge year for sci-fi. It's nice to see that this lost classic has been released on DVD. When I bought the disc, there was little about any ""extras"" on the disc. To my surprise the DVD is lousy with them! Not only is there the widescreen transfer and 5.1 sound, but this disc also includes commentaries by John Sayles, Roger Corman and Gale Ann Hurd, a theatrical trailer for the film, cast/crew biographies and production stills! Wow! I am glad that this disc was released and very happy about the extras included. If you're a big fan of sci-fi, check this one out! If you're going to base a space flick on pre-existing material, you can't go wrong with cribbing form Akira Kurosawa (ie: Star Wars).

1394643,5,B000055ZF1,"Battle Beyond the Stars is one hour and forty  two minutes and was released in theaters on September 8th, 1980. The main story is a peaceful farming community that is being threaten by Sador and his Stellar Converter; a weapon that can change planets into small stars. Zed, an old and blind warrior, suggest that they hire mercenaries to defend the planet. Shad volunteers for this mission and goes looking for mercenaries. He recruits several different life forms to help him out for this mission: a Valkyrie warrior, a Zymer, Kelvins, and five alien clones to name a few. If you were to look at the art work on the DVD cover, it looks like there should have been a few more. Shad brings back the aliens to the planet Akir to help fight Sador and his army of Malmori mutants. Sorry don't like to give away the ending anymore. Battle Beyond the Stars was great for its low budget affects, sets and props. It is mainly know for helping launch careers of John Sayles and James Cameron or as back them Jim Cameron. Some of the actors were already establish like Richard Thomas, Robert Vaughn and George Peppard. Listen both commentaries to this film first and you will get a better appreciation of the film then just thinking of it as another B film. Battle Beyond the Stars gets an AAA+++.

1394648,5,B000055ZF1,"Just finished watching; along with Jeff H., ""Battle Beyond The Stars,"" released by Shout Factory.
""Battle Beyond The Stars"" is an excellent campy ""rip-off' of ""Star Wars"" meets ""The Seven Samurai"" meets ""The Magnificent Seven.""
As portrayed by Richard Thomas - a.k.a. John Boy of ""The Waltons,"" Shad embarks aboard the spaceship named Nell in a desperate attempt to recruit mercenaries to help defend his planet against the ruthless Sador - played by John Saxon - who is threatening to turn it into a mini-sun unless they surrender.
In perhaps one of her most iconic roles, Sybil Danning plays the the sexy Valkyrie Saint-Exmin with such a delightful exuberance who joins in the battle against Sador much to Shad chagrin. Saint-Exmin may live for battle, but she has a surprising depth and understanding of life - perhaps even a greater one than the sheltered Shad.
What makes ""Battle Beyond The Stars"" a great campy movie is the surprising depth of the characters.  Shad grows and matures in his fight against Sador.  He learns the value of sacrifice and is willing to make it himself in order to save his world.  He is battle worn yet he carries the sacrifices others have made for his world deep within him and is willing to pay homage to their sacrifices on his world's behalf.
Strongly Recommended!

1394651,3,B000055ZF1,"BOTTOM LINE: I certainly enjoyed the campy outer space silliness of BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS quite a bit and feel that this movie has a pretty decent replay value, so I'm giving it a modest but honest 3 STARS

THE STORY: One-dimensional evil cosmic bad guy threatens a planet of peace-loving types. Our idealistic, headstrong young hero knows his non-violent people are doomed without outside help, so he commandeers a ship and launches into the vast depths of interstellar space to find skilled fighters to aid his planet in their struggle for freedom. The motley crew of heroes & heroines return with Our Hero to battle the nefarious villain and his brutal henchmen in an exciting, special effects-laden showdown.

THOUGHTS: In an attempt to cash in on the huge popularity of STAR WARS, opportunistic copycat Roger Corman cranked out this formulaic intergalactic quickie. Enjoyable enough on its own, (but still a pretty obvious case of ""slap it together and shove it into cinemas"" film making), BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS is essentially The Seven Samurai in outer space. Good art direction and enjoyable old school optical / miniature special effects elevate this programmer space opera a notch or two higher than others of its ilk, making it an amusing, albeit campy diversion on a rainy day. Much better technically than the dozens of uber-schlocky Italian knock-offs that would clog video store shelves for decades to come, BBTS has the distinction of being one of James (Aliens, Terminator, Avatar, et.al.) Cameron's first important film gigs. Too, it truthfully does sport a pretty eclectic group of B-list stars, including Robert (Man From UNCLE) Vaughn, Sybil ""super-cleavage"" Danning, waxy-faced low budget genre go-to actor John Saxon, George (A-Team) Peppard, and, in one of the oddest casting choices in movie history, wholesome Richard ""John Boy Walton"" Thomas as our courageous young space stud hero.

THE BLU-RAY: Good news to report for genre collectors and lovers of this hammy space adventure. The Blu-ray release (from our pop culture-addicted friends at Shout! Factory) looks quite splendid. The original sound design gets a big boost thanks to a new 5.1 DTS HD mastered audiomix. It is strong and solid. The high-def capabilities of the Blu-ray format are given a good work out here as the video portion of BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS sports excellent picture quality. The video source was the film's original internegative, resulting in outstanding resolution for such a low budget feature. Film grain is evident, so cooler heads prevailed, with a mercifully restrained use of DNR. Artifacting & pixelation are thankfully almost non-existent. That's a huge bonus since so much of this film takes place in either the darkness of outer space or on dimly-lit interior ship sets. Shout! Factory steps up to the plate and drives another one out of the park here with a wealth of bonus features to please fans of this film, including 2 different full-length audio commentary tracks, 2 behind the scenes featurettes, plus the film's trailer and TV ads & radio spots! All great stuff. If you have enjoyed this film since it first made its debut then you're gonna love how great it looks & sounds here on this new Blu-ray. If you're merely curious, you should be suitably impressed at how nicely this low budget film has been preserved.",1447891200,5,3343,5.052536231884058

1394821,5,B000055ZF1,"With the ever phenomenal success of Star Wars in 1977, the inevitable was bound to happen. This is one of those movies that took advantage of the ""afterglow"" and came out a winner. Roger Corman and his crew made a successful science fiction space adventure with good props, decent special effects, and a decent cast including some familiar faces. George Peppard (The A-Team), Richard Thomas (The Walton's), Robert Vaughan (The Magnificent Seven), John Saxon (A Nightmare on Elm St. 1 & 3), Sam Jaffe (Many roles). Everyone pretty much knows the story by now. A small planet, Akir, is threatened by Sador (John Saxon) and his malicious crew of misfits. Richard Thomas (Shad), heads out to space to find mercenaries to fend off Sador, who vows to return in 7 risings to finish off the Akir, if they refuse his ultimatum of conquest. Shad is successful, for the most part, and hires a ragtag bunch of space junkies who have nothing else better to do or are out for personal revenge against the madman.

 As a pre-teen growing up when SW came out in 1977, I loved every single movie or TV series that came out trying to manipulate the success of that movie. This is no exception. The Blu-ray release of this movie is wonderful. The image is clean and the sound is just great with 5.1 DTS-HD audio or 2.0 Dolby Digital, better than anything that has been released before.
If you like this era of science fiction movies, I highly recommend this one!

I find it hard to believe that anyone could seriously place this movie in the same sentence as Kurasowa's Seven Samurai, or the Magnificent Seven.
Wooden acting. Goofy plot.  I can accept certain postulates in science fiction - as long as they follow a consistent logic and have some basis in grounded behavior.  But this plot was thin on many levels; often not even bothering to worry if the story was linear or made any sense.
I watched it through to the end, though.  Glutton for punishment.  I usually have a pretty high tolerance for ""B"" movies, but this one really reeked. Even for free (for Amazon Prime members), this film was a waste of my time.",1409616000,,981,4.61271676300578

1395044,5,B000055ZF1,"First, i want to say a few things about 1980. It seems that many here are too young to remember it. For those who say that the effects are dated, it was 1980-a time when the Commodore 64 (with its 64k of RAM) was still not available on the market. A time before CGI and other things we see as commonplace today. In that vein, the movie's effects aren't BAD. Yes, it is not Star Wars, but not every movie had a mega-budget.

Now, onto the plot. As a kid, i was never a fan of westerns. So, i had never seen The Magnificent Seven. Foreign films would have interested me more, but i've never heard of the Seven Samurai in 1980 (most of the Japanese films i knew of involved a certain big green monster eating Tokyo, or another big green monster (this time a turtle) saving children from space monsters)

So for me the plot was new and fresh.

I don't really know why people say the movie rips off Star Wars. I mean yes, they are both in space with battles, but there is no evil empire (the bad guy is a space bully with his own ship and mega weapon (ok, maybe it is KIND OF like the Death Star, but space villiains have had big nasty weapons before) and there is no Rebel Alliance fighting a government, but farmers who are trying to hire mercenaries to save them from said bad guy.

As a youngster, my brothers took me to see this, and i was amazed at the space station with the androids and the lizard man (that's about all i remembered from my movie experience)

Later, around 1985, we rented it. And i loved it. Each character seemed cool to me (not wooden or cardboard as some say) and the fact that our young hero (Shad) not only found help to save him and his world, but was brave enough to go out and look for it, and fight alongside them made him super cool! Not only that, but he found himself a wife along the way!

Please note-the only thing that detracts from this movie are two brief scenes where sex is discussed (nothing shown-the one ""vamp"" mercenary talks to the young love interest of Shad about sex, and later she asks him about it) and the swearing. (SOB is used a few times, as well as A--) It's a shame that even back then films had that kind of vulgarity. I used to have the TV version on VHS where both things were cut out, but i don't know where that is. And now, even TV would probably leave it in.

Oh, and i did think the living computer (artificial intelligence) named Nell (that is on Shad's ship) was cool! She was kind of a wisecracking, sarcastic mentor for Shad.

SPOILER: The sad part is that all of our heroes (except Shad and his wife-to-be) die at the end-even Nell (the computer) **Note-i'm not sure if the little heat aliens actually died. They might have been able to be revived after they sacrificed themselves by using all their heat against a sonic tank during the ground battle (that sounds strange, but if you watch the movie, you'll understand)

Again, this movie may not interest everyone (my mom hates sci-fi), but please do not judge it on effects (especially compared to today). Judge it for the time period. And for that time, i think the effects are cool. The glowing ship (of the clones-did i mention them?), the androids voices, and the inventive, unique way that every race's ship was controlled (space cowboy's (is was the only Earthling) flew like an 18-wheeler, the clones flew by pressing 4 buttons in sequences, the merc for hire flew like a jet fighter, and Shad flew kind of like a steering wheel) all showed creativity and to me coolness. Back in 1980 i thought so, and even now!",1387324800,,3541,4.336858006042296

1395057,5,B000055ZF1,"Howdy - welcome to this episode of Bowling for Movies... what, you're not sure what Bowling for Movies is?  Well sit right down and I'll share with you the story of Bowling for Movies and then we can discuss the simply amazing bowling score that Battle Beyond the Stars racked up.

You see, I'm just your average dude, with a brain flower of a dream (a brain flower being an idea which blossomed in my mind) - I needed an inventive way to score movies (of which I own hundreds) so that I can say definitively which movies are better, which movies are worst... heck, which movies need to be sold off (and quick).  While the process itself is shrouded in secrecy I can share with you that I use a common garden shovel, a few bits of modern technology, a helping spoonful of grape jelly and a ""sorry, you can't patent that"" mix of quasi/pseudo-science to derive a bowling score for each movie in my collection - of which Battle Beyond the Stars earned an astonishingly high score of 253.125 of 300 - worthy enough that we upgraded this flick from DVD to Blu Ray!

What is the movie about??
Well, 33% Star Wars like space drama, 33% The Magnificent Seven like western, and 47% Roger Corman, lets get this done as quickly and as cheaply as possible - this film is clearly better than the sum of its parts.  When young Shad (Goodnight John Boy) volunteers to pilot the last of the planet's fighter ships named Nell to find mercenaries to fend off Sador (an evil dude with a big gun hell bent on making slaves of them all), he finds himself in dire straits... first he is kidnapped by a desperate man looking for fine breeding stock, nearly shot by an intergalactic bad boy in a decrepit disused night club, and blown to space bits by pirates.  Will Shad find the heroes to save his home planet of Akir or will Sador blow it to bits with his dreaded `Stellar Converter' - will John Boy ride his donkey Blue to Ike Godsey's General Store to pick up the sugar and mail a letter...  At least two of these three questions are answered in Roger Corman's fantastical farce (but all three have Richard Thomas in lead roles!)

Great fun and frolic can be found in this movie from way back in 1980.  I watched this movie when I was a kid and I loved it mightily - drama, action, campy humor, a spaceship with huge boobs, and that guy from the A-Team (George Peppard), what's not to like?  Little Miss Movie Dude has watched this movie at least a dozen times - simply put its pure 80's awesome.  As far as special effects are concerned, I judge them based on two things - against the average effects level for its time, tempered with how well they have kept up with the real test - that of time.  The fine art of model building and forced perspective has gone the way of the dodo but I have to tell you - I loved the way they pulled the effects together on this movie and considering the shoestring budget, the special effects wizards really pulled off an upset against the then growing bloated Industrial Light and Magic... not to surprising since the man responsible for some of the highest grossing films of all time cut his teeth on this film... James Cameron.

Overall, its great because:
~~  It copies standard ""farmers need some big gun help"" formula without spoofing - what the French would call pastiche, done well enough to be taken seriously
~~  Considering this movie was pulled together in months instead of years and in an old lumber yard and warehouse instead of a proper studio, the film is a sight to behold; Corman had a real knack for tapping new talent and gave many BIG TIME Hollywood people their start
~~  Stellar (pun intended) performances by Richard Thomas, his mole, George Peppard, Robert Vaughn, Sybil Danning, and John Saxon

They're going to use their flux capacitor, or whatever, to blast the planet into bits, for no reason, other than the fact that it's there. So, John-boy Walton sets off to find help and defend his homeworld. He enlists Hannibal (from the A-Team), some white guys, a poor chap in an uncomfortable lizard mask, the Man from U.N.C.L.E. and Sybil Danning's bouncing breasts. Together they battle with Mr Saxon...er...beyond the stars in a fight to the death.

It's difficult to believe that this Roger Corman produced, 'Seven Samurai' / 'Magnificent Seven' rip-off once rivaled 'Star Wars' for my affection as a child. I had such fond memories of John-boy's sassy, talking spaceship and George Peppard's ""Space Cowboy"" (yes...that's what his character is actually called). Those fond memories were quickly dashed upon viewing 'Battle Beyond the Stars' with adult eyes. Some things really are best consigned to the memory bin, even if they are enjoyable enough.

While it's not entirely wretched, it is a generally ""bad"" film, with awful editing and terrible pacing. But, it is charming and everyone seems to be having a good laugh. Some of the effects are quite decent for the time and for a budget of just $2.000.000, it's easy to see where the money went. Those said effects and Robert Vaughn / George Peppard's pockets. The model work is actually quite nice too and I understand that some of them were used in other Roger Corman B-Movie extravaganzas later on.

Further honourable mention should go to James Horner, who delivers an pleasant and befitting soundtrack and a little known chap called James Cameron, who's ""special effects"" career seems to have faded away. Pity, he seemed destined for greatness...

The peaceful inhabitants of the planet Akira, who live by a collection of maxims known as ""the Varda,"" find themselves faced with an ultimatum by the power-hungry dictator Sador (John Saxon) and his not-exactly-humanoid followers.  (Why he wants the planet--""solid rock, with one green spot""--is never clearly explained.)  The Akirans may be peaceful, but they're not about to be slaves--the Varda tells them they can use force in self-defense, but they're out of practice; so one of their young men, Shad (Richard Thomas), volunteers to look for mercenaries to help them, using Nell (Lynn Carlin), a sentient starship formerly owned by Zed (Jeff Corey), a blind, retired corsair who has often let him go up in it.  After visiting Dr. Hephaestus (Sam Jaffe), an old friend of Zed's, and acquiring the assistance of his daughter Nanelia (Darlanne Fluegel), he succeeds in recruiting a motley band--Cayman (Morgan Woodward), a reptiloid who's the last survivor of a species destroyed by Sador; his three-being crew (including two who radiate, and communicate with, heat waves); Gelt (Robert Vaughan), a soft-spoken professional merc who has a price on his head on every civiilized planet; Saint-Exmin (Sybil Danning), a grandstanding warrior woman from the Valkyrie society; a five-unit clone collectively known as Nestor (Earl Bowen); and Cowboy (George Peppard), a free-lance freighter captain ""from Earth--know where that is?,"" who isn't for hire to fight, but offers his cargo of hand-weapons after the planet they were consigned to (and which, fortunately, prepaid for them) is destroyed by Sador's ""stellar converter,"" a weapon not unlike the DeathStar's planet-buster.  Against all odds, the mercenaries and Akirans prepare to face the returning Sador.

It's intriguing to observe the cheesiness of the ""exterior"" and space-station sets as opposed to the more sophisticated spaceships (Gelt's is particularly impressive), but for me the best part of the movie is Cowboy, a laid-back independent who works alone and spends his time in space enjoying ""the largest collection of Westerns"" to be found anywhere--and who, with Shad and Nanelia, turns out to be the Akirans' ultimate weapon.  It's not clear when, or where in the galaxy, all this is happening; there are plenty of humanoid species around, and obviously Terran technology must be well advanced, but no one seems to recognize the name of Earth.

Here's the scoop. Bad alien dude John Saxon threatens the planet Akir (Get it? Get it?) if they don't knuckle under. John Boy....I mean Richard Thomas, flies off to find some mercenaries to help thwart said evil plan. He rounds up a rag tag group of aliens and the doo-doo is on.

A space ship with bosoms. Robert Vaughn, reprising his role from the other ""Seven Samurai"" remake ""The Magnificent Seven."" George Peppard, Sam Jaffe's head, Sybil Danning's ample.....costumes and a script by John Sayles. What's not to like?! Actually, it's more fun than it is good. Kurosawa's opus ran about 3 hours and 17 minute. This one, at an hour forty three, reduces some longer aspects of the original to a couple of sentences. It feels more than a bit rushed. And, with Roger Corman holding the purse strings, the production values are wanting. Though, in all fairness, I'm guessing this was one of his more expensive outings.

But fun it is. All the primary actors seem to be having a good time with their roles. Peppard is better than he even had to be. The evil John Saxon character is surrounded by incompetent mutants who keep screwing things up for him, so there is a bit of humor there as well. This was an early Sayles script and, as he's already written for Corman, he seems to have known what to do to get this to work at some inexplicable level. Though barely even a decent movie, it has some cock-eyed appeal that has to be attributed to the script.

This has garnered a cult following and deservedly so. It's a goofy joy ride. Don't expect much out of it. Just let it happen.",1330646400,,1726,4.487261146496815

the money to challenge Star Wars, so most tried to make a space film simular but
there were no major breakthrough.
Well, for those who knows Roger Corman, the King of the Cheap, he tried.
  I saw this film and the drive-in many moons ago...and it just wasn't that good,but
it did have interesting elements to the story like the different characters, it
had John Boy from the Waltons...Robert Vaugh from the Man from Uncle and other
interest like Sybil Danning.

  So, what we had is not a terrible film, but a interesting film because of the
casts and hard work everybody had to do....and the most important part is that
everybody working on the film, except for the ones that got fired...had a good time.

I had long since forgotten about it.  Then a few years ago - tracked it downa nd bought a copy.

This movie came out around the same time as TRON.  Yes - as mentioned it was low-budget so not kicking the special effects.  They at elast were close - if not a step behind what the Buck Rogers and first Battlestar Galactica Series had a few yeras prior.

But I must have gotten a ""bad copy"" of it or something (yes I bought a clean licensed offical copy from a legitimate source) because the editing of the storyline sucked like a vacuum cleaner.  Yes - I can pick out the & Samurai aspect to it (hell - Star Wars does that) but many many moments in the movie that change from one scene to the next leaving you askign WTF and how ddid they get to that point ?  So you mentally have to fill in a wide gap trying to understand the direction of the film.

But here ytou all are 40 something people giving this title raving reviews - probably mostly because you all are holding onto the child-hood memories like I had from all those years ago and not really watching it objectively for what it is - low-budget garbage.

The only ""fond"" memory I still have of this movie is the look of the ship (and the cockpit / controls).

To the folks who have never seen this movie - if you are into low-budget crap-cut storyline knock offs - then this is a great title to check out.

1395214,5,B000055ZF1,"A little less polished than most big budget films (and not a little backward in the special effects department considering what other movies were doing at the same time).  The model work ranged from stellar to papier-mch&eacute; looking.  The same goes for the acting.  When you read some of the names involved in this endeavor, it's very heartening to realize that even talented people can make crap.  (Don't get me wrong, I like this movie.)
Even more bizarre, I realized as I was watching it that the premise of this film is more `A Bug's Life' than Seven Samurai!  Which would make John Saxon the head Grasshopper (he planned to return to the farming planet in a few days and if they didn't have the harvest ready for him.....kabloooooie!.....no more planet).  Not wanting to be homeless, the hippy commune, (I meant farming), call for volunteers but end up with Richard Thomas instead to do the dirty work for them....the filthy ingrates.  Off he goes to gather a ragtag band of warriors (actually just mismatched odds and ends, weirdoes, a cowboy, and an Amazon).  It's all very Oz-like, the gathering of characters that the planet was sadly lacking (basically, he was looking for a body-count rather than just heroes).  War is messy and in this one you lose life and limb.  Which brings up the battle scenes, they left a little to be desired, they were okay (they just lacked the panache of Star Wars).  They serve as a good example of the overall hit or miss quality that hampered this movie from being a classic (although it did become a classic of sorts anyway).

The nice thing about Roger Corman films is that they rarely aspire to be anything other than they are.  Even here, with a bigger budget, it's still has the feel of bargain basement wares.  Corman wasn't trying to make art; he was trying to make decent entertainment.  In that, I think he succeeds; that's why I like it: it's entertaining (and oddly endearing).  Everything from the sassy space ship to a couple of hot cabbage patch dolls, it's all good fun.  I for one am glad it's on DVD and that I could add it to my collection.

1395225,5,B000055ZF1,"In 1980, legendary low budget producer Roger Corman produced the most expensive film ($2M) of his career, a special-effects-heavy space opera in the vein of STAR WARS. That sci-fi epic, BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS, has just been re-released in a 30th Anniversary Special Edition (actually, shouldn't that be 31st Anniversary?) by Shout! Factory on both DVD and Blu-ray disc.

The planet of Akir is a desert world ""with one green spot."" Its inhabitants are peaceful farmers, who live by the nonviolent code of The Varda. Unfortunately, this makes them a tempting target for intergalactic despot Sador (John Saxon, ENTER THE DRAGON, QUEEN OF BLOOD), who strives for immortality by replacing his worn-out limbs and organs with transplanted replacements culled from beings like the humanoid Akira. He gives them an ultimatum - submit to his rule or be destroyed - then gives them time to ponder his ""offer"" while he scoots off to destroy a planet that has chosen to defy him. Desperate, the people of Akir send farmboy Shad (Richard Thomas, THE WALTONS, STEPHEN KING'S ""IT"") off in their only functioning starship, the sentient - and decidedly female - Nell, to buy weapons and recruit mercenaries to help them stand against Sador and his mutant armies. Shad scours the star system and ultimately returns with seven (give or take) alien defenders, but even with these valiant souls, the odds are not in their favor...

An unabashed mash-up of George Lucas' STAR WARS and Akira Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI/Robert Sturges' THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, this satisfying and exciting space opera is graced with a witty, intelligent screenplay by John Sayles (PIRANHA, LONE STAR), a game cast comprised of veteran character actors and TV stars (Jeff Corey, Sam Jaffe, Robert Vaughn, George Peppard, Morgan Woodward, Marta Kristen, Sybil Danning, et al), and remarkably accomplished miniature spaceship effects by a talented crew of enthusiastic young technicians, including James Cameron and the Skotak brothers. Wrapped up in a sweeping, Jerry Goldsmith-inspired musical score by James Horner, BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS is probably the best of the STAR WARS imitators - and in some ways, it's maybe a little better.

Director Jimmy T. Murakami keeps things moving at a brisk pace, and - with his talented cast - maintains a breezy, tongue-in-cheek tone that doesn't preclude moments of genuine heart and occasional pathos. Sayles' script is intentionally funny, with lots of amusing wordplay and sly innuendo. Everyone in the cast hits exactly the right notes to sell their comic book characters and the comfortingly familiar story. Standouts include  George Peppard's (THE A-TEAM, DAMNATION ALLEY) space trucker, Cowboy; statuesque Sybil Danning's (CHAINED HEAT) stunning and sexy Valkyrie warrior, St. Exmin; and Robert Vaughn (HUSTLE, THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.) as Gelt, a professional killer somewhat modeled after the character that Vaughn played in the original MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

The special effects are a  triumph of Old School/pre-CGI craftsmanship, with a variety of unique spaceship designs (especially Cameron's Nell), detailed tabletop miniature landscapes and plenty of fiery explosions. Corman, appalled at the prices quoted to him by established FX houses, ended up setting up his own special effects unit for the production, and then re-used/recyled the space shots from this movie over and over for the next couple of decades (along with Horner's score)!

The Shout! Factory Blu-ray ""Roger Corman's Cult Classics"" presentation of BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS is, in every way, a quantum leap over the original DVD release from Corman's own New Concorde label. That edition was non-anamorphic and sourced from a battered print that looked like it had been stored in a ditch behind his office for 25 years. This newly-remastered (from the internegative) 1080p, 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer still possesses a few random specks and scratches, but is otherwise remarkably clean and clear. Contrast and color balance are notably improved, and details are sharp and well-defined in most shots. Some of the special effects sequences are of noticeably lesser quality, but that's inherent in the FX technology of the time. Overall, it's a very impressive presentation of a 31-year old genre film. Audio options include a new 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo. Bonus material includes the two fine commentary tracks from the original DVD release - one by Corman and screenwriter John Sayles, and the other by Production Manager Gale Ann Hurd. There's a new behind-the-scenes/retrospective documentary, a video interview with star Richard Thomas, a handful of still galleries, and the original trailer, TV spot and radio ads.

For fans of 70s - early 80s sci-fi (and traditional special effects), BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS is essential viewing. Smart, funny and bright, with a great cast, this cosmic adventure is endlessly entertaining. If you're already a fan of this flick, the new Shout! Factory special edition (especially the HD Blu-ray) is likely to be the definitive presentation for the forseeable future. I would have liked a few more bonus features, but it's a terrific package overall, and highly recommended.",1310688000,9,5233,5.3192261185006044
1395226,5,B000055ZF1,"Roger Corman is known for being the low budget king of B-Movies. Although I am not much a fan of Corman's flash in the pan micro-budget movies this one has a certain charm that can only be brought together through some talented people behind him. Mind you this is still a low budget B-movie and it shows. Still the young at heart will appreciate enough of this film to put a smile on their face.

First off, as mentioned before, the plot is nothing new. While a lot of people would say he is ripping off Star Wars that is really not the case (although he probably is banking on the popularity of the space opera). As a matter of fact Corman, in his infinite desire to copy successful themes based Battle Beyond the Stars on the The Magnificent Seven. Which of course was copied by John Sturges in his western classic from Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece The Seven Samurai. So technically Corman didn't copy anything that wasn't already copied. Still a good plot is a good plot no matter where it came from and putting it in a science fiction setting only makes the movie that much more interesting.

What makes this story work so well is that Corman ""gets"" what Magnificent Seven (and Seven Samurai for that matter) were doing... at least to a point. These movies were less about the brave warriors protecting a community from evil raiders and more about the various personalities of said warriors. Battle Beyond the stars takes that to different level with the different warriors coming from different planets and cultures. While most of the character development is a little more than two dimensional the amount of various characters really make up for it. From there you have a usual space opera fare. Spaceships roaring and blowing each other up to majestic music. Villains wearing black and acting ruthless. Heroes giving pretty speeches. Nothing as noteworthy as the character interactions.

There is actually a surprising amount of well-known talent in the cast. It makes me wonder how Corman got them all on such a tight budget. We're talking people like Richard Thomas (of Waltons fame), Morgan Woodward (How the West Was Won), and Robert Vaughn (in practically the same role he played on Magnificent Seven). I would say the acting is actually quite good for the short amount of time they had to shoot the film. Special effects are on the low side, but not all that cheesy. Set designs weren't bad at all. I actually enjoyed the backdrops. The spaceship designs are really cool too, thanks to future mega-Director James Cameron. Even though there is no exciting motion control flying like Star Wars, at least the spaceships themselves were very creative. The music is an instant classic and is done by James Horner, another star in his field (he has composed music for A Beautiful Mind, The Perfect Storm, Titanic and more).

Okay enough waxing over the cool stuff. This is still a B-movie and it does have some bad drawbacks. The bad thing about the plot (and forgive me if I spoil it for anybody) is that essentially all the heroes that were rounded up to save the planet end up getting picked off one by one until only the main star is left. I hate it when movies do that... so stereotypical. You can tell a lot of the space battle scenes are the same clips from footage earlier in the film. Yeah I know... budget constraints, but it's still cheesy. The extras they have on set end up not really looking like they know what they are doing. Also some of the scenes that try and portray action and excitement end up falling a little flat. So yeah... it's still a B-movie.

We are finally getting this B-Movie gem on Blu-Ray, and since Shout Factory is releasing as part of their B-Movie release bonanza there is reason to be excited. So far Shout Factory has put out some pretty impressive looking Blu-Rays of movies you wouldn't think would ever look so good in high definition without major studio intervention. My expectations are pretty high that BBtS will look and sound better than ever. First off they announced a brand new 5.1 DTS Master audio track. Also the two commentaries from the old DVD release will be present. From there you are going to get some extra features I never seen before. Here's the breakdown:

Aforementioned Audio Commentary - One with Production Manager Gale Anne Hurd and another with Directory Roger Corman and Writer John Sayles

Space Opera on a Shoestring - A documentary on technical and post production of the movie with interviews from  Aaron Lipstadt, Alec Gillis, Alex Hajdu, Allan Holzman, R.J. Kizer, Robert & Dennis Skotak, Thom Shouse and Tony Randel. Sorry... no James Cameron.

The Man Who Would Be Shad - Brand new interview with actor Richard Thomas.

Promotional - Trailers, TV commercials, Radio Spots.

In my humble opinion I believe this movie should be considered required viewing for those hardcore sci-fi fans. It's too much a strong part of the genre's heritage to pass up. That being said this is not Oscar winner by any stretch of the imagination. While it's cheap and cheesy in many, many ways it's also refined in ways you don't see in many other B-movies. The Blu-Ray (and upcoming 30th Anniversary DVD release) will have never before seen features and undoubtedly a cleaned up look. If you can forgive the fact the film has all the trappings of an ultra low budget movie and see the fact that they did a LOT with that budget then set yourself up for a treat.",1306281600,50,5428,4.6911764705882355

1395231,5,B000055ZF1,"I have never really been a big fan of Roger Corman's movies. But this one I loved! I seen this one a long time ago when I was a kid, and loved it. I was surprised that I had never even heard of it before. Everybody's heard of ""Star Wars"", even if they've never seen it before, but this film is really a film that only a small number have heard of. I would have never have known of it myself if I hadn't accidently caught it on television one time.

A lot of people say how corny this film is... well it's no more cornier than ""Star Wars"". Meaning - it's NOT corny! It's just a cheaper movie, which a lot of people now days think is what makes a movie corny. To tell you the truth I thought the special effects were almost just as good as those that were in ""Star Wars"", and the story was certainly just as good. Basically it is a ""Star Wars"" copy-cat with a cheaper budget. It has everything in it that makes a great movie: a good plot, action, good and engaging charaters, good actors, good effects, good charater moments, good drama, a lot of good comedy, death, war, love, and a happy ending... it's got everything. And unlike many Corman films, this one is good for the whole family.

The Plot:

The evil Sador, a mad tyrant who wants to rule the universe, comes to the peaceful planet Akira with his army and threatens to destroy their world unless they surrender. Like Darth Vador in ""Star Wars"", Sador too has a weapon that can destroy an entire planet. With no army and very little fire power, the Akirans have no choice but to surrender. But not all are willing to give up so easily. The elder of the planet, Zed (who is like Obi-Wan Kenobi), the last warrior of Akira, sends the young and enthusiastic Shad on a mission to recruit an army of star warriors to protect the planet. Shad (Luke) leaves his home in search of warriors in an old spaceship with a fiesty talking computer named Nell. Together, they recuit a number of interesting charaters - Nanelia (Leia), Cowboy (Han Solo), a race of telepathic alien clones called Nestor, the warrior queen Saint-Exmin of the Valkyrie, a reptilian creature called Cayman who is the last of his kind since Sador wiped out the rest of his race for resisting his rule, and the intergalactic bounty hunter Gelt who is trying to make up for past sins. Togeter they battle the ruthless Sador over impossible odds in an attempt to not only save Akira, but to end Sador's reign over the universe forever.

What I did not remember, however, as the incredibly awkward ""sex"" talk between ""John Boy"" and his love interest (and her father earlier). That was just painful to watch.

The legendary Roger Corman was responsible for this film. That fact, in and of itself, is probably why this ""poor man's Star Wars"" deserves a look.

The special effects (for their time) were actually quite good. They were not of Star Wars caliber, but they were much better than other sci-fi films of the time.

The story is one we're all familiar with (a la The Magnifient Seven). Poor old planet Akir is being picked on by intergalactic baddie, Sador (sound almost like Vader, doesn't it?). The young and naive boy (a la Luke Skywalker) has to leave his home for the first time on an intergalactic trip to find some people who will help him defend Akir from mutant invaders.

The rest, you can pretty much figure out.

Even though the story is one we've heard and the plot is pretty predictable, this movie has so much charm and appeal that you can't help but watch.

The casting was well done (with Robert Vaughn, George Peppard, and the ever-dramatic John Saxon) and everyone gives decent performances. The costumes and sets are above average and the music is just fantastic (composed by Hollywood legend James Horner). Some of the ships, though (like the main character's ship which kind of resembles the female reproductive system) are pretty strage, but many of them are quite good.

Star Wars it ain't, but Battle Beyond the Stars is a fun sci-fi movie not to be taken too seriously.

I do want to own this title, but I'm just not willing to pay $30.00 to $40.00 (the current asking price) for it. I know the DVD is out of print, but maybe someone will come along that's willing to ask a reasonable price for it, or perhaps a re-issue of this film looms in the near future.",1181779200,2,1862,4.520833333333333

  the extras are ok not great but better than most movies like this (lowbuget indie production) and that makes this one a great buy!!!!",1150761600,4,1285,4.663716814159292
1395260,5,B000055ZF1,"John Sayles was asked by Roger Corman to adapt The Seven Samurai into a sci fi picture and the result is this delightfully inventive tongue-in-cheek romp.

What's most enjoyable about the film is the fact that every mercenary hired by the peaceful ""villagers"" has a distinct personality and style and their intentions clearly defined. George Peppard( as the only human among them) is laid back and charming. Morgan Woodward seems to be having a grand old time playing the vengeful lizard-man (dig his gonzo war-cry during the climactic battle!) Robert Vaughn does seem a bit bored but he effectively communicates his character's unpleasant coldness. Sybill Danning simply has one of the most stunning bodies to ever be stuffed into a styrofoam viking costume, even if she can't act. Add to these characters 2 elfin aliens who communicate thru heat( the Kelvin, wink, wink) and a troupe of what looks like Mimes( called ""Nestor"") who operate sort of like to the collectivist Borg from Star Trek and in disposition seem to anticipate the infectious optimism and curiosity of Mr Data as well; when first introduced they explain, "" We believe you are seeking mercenaries for an adventure. We would like to participate.""
The costumes, sets and spfx are obviously done on a very low budget but that hardly detracts from the fun. Special mention must be made of John Saxon who, as the evil scourge of the galaxy Lord Sador, grabs his opportunity to chew the scenery with amusing gusto; Check the sequence where he gets to enact what must be every actors dream since DR STRANGELOVE: to have a battle with his own rebellious arm! He plays it all straight, with just the right notes of hysteria and menace. Its sometimes just enjoyable to watch veteran actors cut loose and have a good time; the spirit is infectious, as it certainly is with this film. Fun for the whole family as well as bonged-out college students and other usually disparaging types( i once watched this in a Penitentiary day-room and every single convict, regardless of race, color or creed, had a blast.)",1130198400,6,2066,4.869318181818182
1395261,4,B000055ZF1,"Roger Corman is known for being the low budget king of B-Movies. Although I am not much a fan of Corman's flash in the pan micro-budget movies this one has a certain charm that can only be brought together through some talented people behind him. Mind you this is still a low budget B-movie and it shows. Still the young at heart will appreciate enough of this film to put a smile on their face.

First off, as mentioned before, the plot is nothing new. As a matter of fact Corman, in his infinite desire to copy successful themes based Battle Beyond the Stars on the classic The Seven Samurai. Which of course was copied by John Sturges in his western classic The Magnificent Seven. Which ended up being copied by just about every other western under the sun. So technically Corman didn't copy anything that wasn't already copies several times over. Still a good plot is a good plot no matter where it came from and putting it in a science fiction setting only makes the movie that much more interesting. Not to mention the fact that this story has officially branched to three different film genres. The bad thing about how it works in this movie is that essentially all the heroes that were rounded up to save the planet end up getting picked off one by one until only the main star is left. I hate it when movies do that... so stereotypical.

There is actually a surprising amount of well-known talent in the cast. It makes me wonder how Corman got them all on such a tight budget. We're talking people like Richard Thomas (of Waltons fame), Morgan Woodward (How the West Was Won), and Robert Vaughn (in practically the same role he played on Magnificent Seven). I would say the acting is actually quite good for the short amount of time they had to shoot the film. Special effects are on the low side, but not all that cheesy. Set designs weren't bad at all. I actually enjoyed the backdrops. The spaceship designs are really cool too, thanks to future mega-Director James Cameron. Even though there is no exciting motion control flying like Star Wars, at least the spaceships themselves were very creative. The music is an instant classic and is done by James Horner, another rising star in his field (he has composed music for A Beautiful Mind, The Perfect Storm, Titanic and more).

Okay enough waxing over the cool stuff. This is still a B-movie and it does have some bad drawbacks. The plot shortcoming for one (picking off all the cool talent) is a real disappointment. You can tell a lot of the space battle scenes are just clips from footage earlier in the film. Yeah I know... budget constraints, but it's still cheesy. The extras end up not really looking like they know what they are doing. Also some of the scenes that try and portray action and excitement end up falling a little flat. So yeah... it's still a B-movie.

In my humble opinion I believe this movie should be considered required viewing for those hardcore sci-fi fans. It's too much a strong part of the genre's heritage to pass up. That being said this is not Oscar winner by any stretch of the imagination. While it's cheap and cheesy in many, many ways it's also refined in ways you don't see in many other B-movies. If you can forgive the fact the film has all the trappings of an ultra low budget movie and see the fact that they did a LOT with that budget then set yourself up for a treat.",1118966400,6,3376,4.502446982055465
1395279,4,B000055ZF1,"Have you ever heard of the term ""unintended consequences""? I first heard of this phrase in an economics course at the university. It deals, of course, with the unseen and often harmful results of any given financial policy or action. I would now like to extend the term beyond economics into the realm of films, specifically George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" and the unintended consequences its release inflicted on unwary moviegoers. No one can dispute the greatness of ""Star Wars"" or its effect on the world of science fiction filmmaking. We still see the influence of this epic today. At the time, however, Lucas's marvel inspired a slew of low budget clunkers desperately trying to cash in on the popularity of Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo. Movies like ""The Shape of Things to Come"" were so hilariously awful in every aspect of their execution that one could have understood if Lucas issued a public apology for indirectly inspiring such tripe. But, and this is a big but, a few films emerged that were entertaining even if they did rip off ""Star Wars."" Or ""The Magnificent Seven,"" for that matter. Welcome to Roger Corman's ""Battle Beyond the Stars.""

In a galaxy far, far away we meet an evil tyrant named Sador (John Saxon) zipping around the stars conquering planets with a weapon called the stellar converter. Actually, he seems to enjoy destroying worlds with this weapon when the citizens attempt to defy his will. His most recent excursion takes him to a planet of peaceful folks who simply can't understand why someone would knock on their door and threaten them. One of the residents, a headstrong youth called Shad (Richard Thomas), offers to fly the planet's sole battleship into space in order to marshal an army to defeat this evil dictator. It's laughable, really, but Shad is too young to realize exactly what he's up against. Off he goes in the ship, with Nell the talking computer in tow, to find his warriors. The first half of the movie deals solely with Shad's encounters with the various characters who will join him. For example, he enlists the services of a bored human arms merchant named Cowboy (George Peppard), the sexy, headstrong Saint-Exmin (Sybil Danning), some lizard guy, a group of clones called Nestors, and a pair of goofy creatures called Kelvins because they can use heat as a weapon. There's also a morose outlaw by the name of Gelt (Robert Vaughn) who joins the fight to make up for some of the bad things he's done in his life. You get the idea.

The second half of the movie kicks into high gear as this ragtag team of galactic miscreants challenges Sador and his malformed minions to a rip-roaring fight. The baddies basically laugh their heads off at these upstarts until they realize these guys play for keeps. Sador thus decides to land an attack squad on Shad's planet (the name of which is Aker or Okra, something like that) while simultaneously trying to fend off the attack in space. Predictably, most of our heroes won't survive the resulting conflagration, but that's the point of the movie (or ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""Stars Wars""). That a bunch of hardened, totally at odds races can band together to confront a common enemy in defense of a pacifistic people is the idea at the core of the movie. Well, that and a whole lotta cheese. ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" is one of the cheesiest films I've ever seen, and that's saying something. Richard Thomas as a space hero? Space valkyries? A villain with a birthmark the size of Montana on his face? What's going on here? Simple: it's Roger Corman at his plagiaristic best. Give Corman a check for twenty-five bucks and he'll make a movie. I'm pretty sure ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" cost more than a couple of sawbucks, but I wouldn't bet on it.

Fortunately, ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" contains plenty of action, the sort of do or die dialogue every action film ought to have, and Sybil Danning in an outfit that must have sent the young pre-teen males in the audience into a dither--or therapy. It's got Julia Duffy in a small role as Mol, Shad's little sister. It's got a spaceship shaped like a well-endowed woman. And it's got veteran B-movie actor John Saxon on high camp autopilot as Sador, complete with heavy pancake makeup and a tendency to use others' body parts to replace his own failing limbs. Even as my sides ached from laughing I couldn't help but like this movie. Sure, it's adolescent and simplistic, but it's also great fun to see this many B-movie stars in one movie. The only SERIOUS problem I had with the film concerned Nell, the talking computer on Shad's spaceship. There hasn't been a cool talking computer since HAL in ""2001,"" and I wish movies would quit trying to come up with one. Aside from that niggling complaint, and with full awareness that this is a breathtakingly cheesy film, Corman's flick is rather enjoyable.

The DVD throws plenty of extras our way. Two commentary tracks enlighten us about the film's pedigree, namely how John Sayles wrote the script and how James Cameron built the props. Filmographies, a trailer, a trivia game, and trailers for ""Saint Jack,"" ""Suburbia,"" ""Piranha,"" and ""Fire on the Amazon"" round out the supplements. Say what you will about schlock science fiction knockoffs, but you've got to appreciate a film that has George Peppard bantering with an alien race about the ingredients found in hotdogs, wouldn't you say? A must see for cheese lovers.",1110499200,7,5427,4.776357827476039
1395280,3,B000055ZF1,"The commentaries on this film are an absolute MUST for aspiring filmmakers.  There are two separate commentary tracks, one by Corman and Sayles, one by Gayle Anne Hurd.  They are fascinating lessons in the art,not to mention the joys, of moviemaking.  The ""can-do"" spirit, the creativity, the desire for artistic excellence on a budget, and yes even the fun of making the movies will inspire anybody who ever thought of pointing a camera.  Corman and Sayles offer a lot of things to consider for all the people ramping up their digital cameras, and some useful tips for any era (flashing lights can make a crappy set look much better - as any fan of the original Star Trek knows)

The commentary is really a ""warts and all"" kind of thing in some respects.  Hurd's comments include an incident in which a tech guy is accidentally cut and severs his femoral artery and has to be rushed (in Hurd's car!) to the hospital.  On the other hand, Hurd talks about how she and James Cameron were painting a set at 3:00 a.m. and reflecting on how well they worked together and vowed to keep making movies together - a partnership which eventually led to Terminator 2.

The lessons to be learned by aspiring filmmakers on these commentaries are definitely worth the price of the DVD.  And it's not a bad little movie either.",1106092800,4,1312,4.620689655172414

The characters are lots of fun, the story is good, and the special effects are above average. In fact, lots of the model work would later be used in many other movies, creating an endless supply of stock footage for New World Productions.

1395287,5,B000055ZF1,"What allows Battle Beyond the Stars to transcend its low budget, simple special effects and infinitely recycled plot? The most important aspect of filmmaking: Ideas.
This was one [heck] of a smart script. No surprise, since the writer is John Sayles, a screenwriter of impeccable literary sense. The dialogue of this film crackles better than most big-budget films I've seen, and as a result Darlanne Fluegel (as innocent maiden Nanelia), Robert Vaughn (ice-cool mercenary Gelt), Sybil Danning (who steals the show as dashing, comically busty Valkyr warrior Saint-Exmin), Earl Boen (as lead drone Nestor) and George Peppard (as Space Cowboy) all shine, having a field day with the incredibly brisk pace and economical character interactions. And there's great comic material here, which is like an amplification of the gently sardonic tone of Seven Samurai, the obvious ancestor of this film.
The richness of Sayles' conception of this world just draws you in -- even more so, I would argue, than Star Wars, because the depth of the philosophical implications behind the details is phenomenal. The ""Facets"" of Nestor, the on-the-run nihilism of Gelt the mercenary, and the communicative dilemma of the Kelvin -- it all points to very real human needs and psychological desires, hidden behind the comic-book action and tongue-in-cheek tone. Revel, as well, in the amount of attention paid to the design: Talking spaceship ""Nell"" is in the shape of a giant woman's body; the stingray menace of Gelt's ship; the different kinds of ""hum"" that each character's vehicle produces. Shows what you can do even with little money if you put some thought into it.
Though it doesn't have the mystique of Star Wars -- whose amalgamation of chivalric romance and science fiction created a new sub-culture -- Battle Beyond the Stars deserves applause for overcoming its humble origins. And for all of the rich background, it's one of the fastest-moving science-fiction films I've ever seen.

Well, that never happened (though it still could .... shudder).

Battle beyond the stars is a cult film, of which I have not drunk the Koolaid in spite of seeing it a few times on HBO.  It's not very well shot, the script is okay (though could have used a rewrite or two), and the onscreen talent and directing screams made for TV late night viewing.

In short, I don't why this film continues to thrive by reputation from people who legitimately like the movie.  Whatever.  Far be it from me to be judgmental, but this movie has no core theme, does not have a very good cast, and just overall lacks a vision.  To wit, I can't imagine anyone wanting this thing on bluray.

If I had shot it I would have shot it like Kurosawa's 7-Samurai, and dumped money into sets and extras to populate the world, and fire the SFX team.  That's a movie worth seeing.

As it stands now this thing was trying to ride Star Wars' coat tails, and it seems a lot of scifi fans with a low bar for taste have helped bolster this film's reputation to keep it being re-released on various video formats.

Whatever.
