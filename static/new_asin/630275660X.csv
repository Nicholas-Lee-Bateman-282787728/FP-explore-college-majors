7830418,3,630275660X,"Dennis the Menace is a good cartoon. I don't remember watching this cartoon series before and from this videotape, the cartoon is pretty good. This VHS tape contains four cartoons.

Lean, Green, Jumping Machines - 5/5
I liked the reference to Mark Twain being a ghost.

Shark Treatment - 4/5
Good cartoon, but the stupidity is amazing. How could any character have confused Dennis inside a mechanical shark with an actual talking shark especially people that know him well like Mr. Wilson?

Jungle Bungle - 4/5
Dennis' fake crying in order to get away from the orangutan was annoying.

Dinosaur Doozie- 5/5
I like the notion of someone, in this case Dennis, raising a dinosaur in modern times.

This could have been a longer videotape with more cartoons. Otherwise besides that and the two 4/5 cartoons out of 4 of them, this videotape is good.",1306800000,,844,4.793103448275862
