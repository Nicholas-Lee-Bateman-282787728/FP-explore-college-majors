7855094,5,6303922252,"A wonderful and engaging film. This is a well-acted story that engages the viewer with a tale about friendship, love, and sacrifice. Three life-long friends share a special bond with each other.

Miss Oberon has some special moments to watch for when even though she has no lines, her non-verbal response captures a scene in a touching or poignant way.

I watched this film on Turner Classic and it is well worth watching for TCM to play again.",1458000000,,444,4.67948717948718
7855095,3,6303922252,"Video quality of Spanish DVD not all that good.  Alot of ""ghosting"" and somewhat blurry at times.  Definitely mastered from a videotape. Not worth the money for the Region 2 DVD.",1421884800,,178,4.709677419354839
7855096,5,6303922252,"Although the 1935 version of THE DARK ANGEL was a remake of an earlier silent film, it too seems to have disappeared into obscurity--and what a shame!  This movie will not appeal to fans of the current brand of Hollywood ""love stories"", where the hero and heroine (or same sex couples in some cases) slip easily into bed together after only just meeting, several car chases and shoot-outs ensue, and the plots remind you of the last Meg Ryan film you saw because they are all the same--and they are filmed in color.  THE DARK ANGEL is from an entirely different era of film making: the glorious 1930s.  A time when movies, particularly love stories, depended on a good script and good acting to keep the viewer watching, and if successful in both these areas, the viewer won't notice that the movie is in black and white.  And what a wonderful job they did with this film!  Although, like most films of the time, it may seem dated to modern viewers, this film is set twenty years earlier during World War 1, and deals with a love triangle between stoic Herbert Marshall, lovely and gracious Merle Oberon, and the always charming and very handsome Frederic March.  When Oberon decides to marry March instead of Marshall, she finds there isn't time to get the proper licenses and such before the boys are shipped out to war.  Instead, March and Oberon stage a faux wedding and spend an evening together in a hotel on their last night together.  Whether they consumated their ""union"" or not is left up to the viewers imagination--today you'd see everything in graffic detail.  Due to a misunderstanding, Herbert Marshall's character (who is March's superior officer) comes to believe that March has spent the night with a prostitute, and to retalitate he refuses March's request for a leave so he can marry Oberon.  During an explosion, March is blinded.  Afraid to be rejected by Oberon, he goes into hiding after the war and becomes a successful author of children's books.  Oberon and Marshall believe him to be dead, and then decide to marry each other.  Only then do the couple learn that March is still alive.  Will Oberon go ahead and marry Marshall as planned?  Will she take March back?  Will self-pitying March have her?  And will Oberon's obnoxious cousin gets what's coming to him?  Sounds like a pretty juicy soap opera, and it is, only the acting, directing, and styling in every area is worlds away from the schlock you're liable to see today.  If these vintage ""weepies"" are not to your liking, go ahead and pick up a Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan film and stare at the screen for 90 mind-numbing minutes and come out thinking you've seen quality acting and a good story.  But if you can get past the black and white photography and slightly dated speech and acting style--and this is some darn good acting!--I highly recommend giving this one a watch.  Yes, it's a ""chick flick"" from long ago, but it will leave you sad, happy, and in a romantic mood.  Too bad it's ""out of stock"" at the moment.",1060387200,24,3005,4.640831758034026
7855097,5,6303922252,"Let me begin by saying I have recently discovered Fredric March. I am 40 yrs. old and never saw him in anything until this summer when I saw him in ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"". After that, I was hooked, and now I have collected over 40 of his films. This man is a wonderful actor that noone should miss. In this film Fredric March plays a man, Alan Trent, who came to live with his aunt and cousin Gerald Shannon(played by Herbert Marshall)in England when he was a boy. The 2 boys grew up together, and are close and great friends. They both happen to love the same girl, Kitty(Merle Oberon). Well, Fred wins Kitty's heart, and they want to be married before he must go to war, but due to circimstances beyond their control,they can't. Kitty spends the night with him before he leaves (they remain chaste), and this scene of them together is very well done. Unfortunately, Gerald gets the wrong idea about the evening Alan had, and later as his commanding officer at the battlefront, sends Alan on a dangerous mission instead of granting him leave so he can marry Kitty. Gerald believes he has died in action, and regrets that he sent Alan on the mission. I don't want to tell too much of the story...but Alan is not dead, only blind. Fredric March is a man of amazing talent. As a blind man, he is totally convincing. One of my favorite scenes is when he is alone in his hotel room, and he feels his way around. We see Fred's hands as he touches a wall lamp. When he stands by the door when the children come in, for two of them have never seen a blind man, it is the most touching and beautiful scenes I have seen Fred in. He was truly a beautiful man. I will say that this film ends happily, with all things right and as they should be. If you like WW1 timeframe movies ( I do), and if you like romances (I do), and if you like to gaze upon Fredric March as a handsome soldier and otherwise (I do), then this movie will in no way disappoint you. It is a hard to find video, but well worth it!",1035849600,15,1993,4.206266318537859
