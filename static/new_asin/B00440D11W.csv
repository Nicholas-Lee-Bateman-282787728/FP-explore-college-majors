8427936,5,B00440D11W,Good collection at a very good price.  It think it is childish to rate the product 1 star for not knowing about DVD region encoding.,1511568000,3,132,4.28
8427937,4,B00440D11W,Love these movies but I had to give it lower rating because it is region specific. But it is not specified clearly that it is. I bought a all region blue ray DVD player so problem solved.,1510704000,2,187,4.081081081081081

8427941,1,B00440D11W,I was very disappointed because I can't play the tapes.  They are formatted for Region 2 so they won't play on my DVD played which is made for only Region 1 tapes.  I am sending it back. I looked online and researched how to override the Region setting but unfortunately it didn't have one for my particular DVD play.  I was very upset and disappointed. Now I have the expense of sending it back. Not Happy! No one tells you this when you order a tape!,1425945600,7,452,4.232558139534884
