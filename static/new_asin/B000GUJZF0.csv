2619746,3,B000GUJZF0,"Reflecting on the movie while on the mid-watch on a naval ship in the South China Sea in 1969 was an experience that has never left me. The constant turning inside out of what Nicholas Urfe believed was going on, through the leap from stories told by Conchis at the dinner table becoming either reality or staged reinactments that tested Urfe's belief and sense of morality fed my hunger for thought provoking dialog. I had to buy the book and read it. I went on to ""The French Leutenant's Woman"", and ""The Aristos"", soaking up Fowle's philosophy.

Later, attending an interview with John Fowles in San Francisco with my Daughter, he said, ""I didn't think 'The Magus' was very good"". I wanted to stand up and say, ""But I named my Son Nicholas!"" I think he got tired of answering the questions about what it meant, when it really wasn't intended to give answers. Like someone else said in a review here, one of his favorite themes was ""An answer is a form of death"".

Candice Bergen said one time that as her third movie appearance she thought is might be her worst. She might be right. I loved the movie for where it lead me at the time, not as something that would entertain me again and again. Skip the movie, or see it for the novelty, but read the book if you want the experience that Fowles meant you to have.",1201737600,15,1314,4.403292181069959

2619748,3,B000GUJZF0,"Although this film came out in 1968, it has only recently become available on DVD. Until then, you had to wait for the rare occasions it was shown on TV to see it. I would mainly recommend this film to people who have read the novel and are very fond of it. The Magus is one of my favorite books and the fact that the author, John Fowles, wrote the screenplay for the film, not to mention the interviews that are included in the DVD with people who knew him, make the movie well worth seeing. I have to admit that the film, taken by itself, is not great and might not even make much sense to anyone who hasn't read the book (or has read it but wasn't crazy about it). Still, I'm not sure why some critics seemed quite so harsh towards it. To me, it falls into the vast category of movies that are neither terrible or great. I was mainly disappointed with it relative to the merits of the novel.

Out of all the performances in The Magus, the only one I really liked was Anthony Quinn, who perfectly captured the enigmatic Conchis. Michael Caine and Candace Bergen are both good actors (and seem improbably young in this 1968 film!), but neither really stood out in this film. Caine as Nicholas, the young man who gets ensnared in Conchis' deceitful web on a remote Greek island, never seems to be experiencing any real confusion or torment. While the novel evokes a profound sense of existentialist dread, the film seems more like a bizarre theme park.

The premise of The Magus is a fascinating one. On the surface, it's about a rather aimless and self-centered young man, Nicholas, who is teaching on a Greek island and meets a mysterious older man, Maurice Conchis. As Conchis relates events of his life, people and scenes appear to Nicholas, making the island a kind of stage setting. Nicholas falls in love with a young woman who may or may not be a co-conspirator in Conchis' plot (in the novel, there are twins, which makes the whole situation even more complex).  It soon becomes apparent that nothing Conchis says can be taken at face value. He may be a doctor, a film producer or simply a sadistic madman who likes to torment victims. Nicholas becomes completely trapped in a world where nothing is what it seems and reality is unknowable. I think the latter sums up what The Magus is really about --the basic mystery and ambiguity of identity, experience and life.

The basic theme of The Magus can be seen in much later films such as The Matrix and Dark City, though these rely much more on special effects to get their messages across. Probably the film that best captures this theme (actually a much better film than either The Magus or The Matrix) is The Stunt Man, which uses a movie set as a brilliant metaphor for the ambiguity of life. So, once again, the film will mainly be of interest for those who can't get enough of the book.",1188345600,4,2850,4.464491362763916
2619749,3,B000GUJZF0,"There is a John Fowles bio-pic included in the extras with this DVD that makes it damn near worth the going price. Still, really, no matter how much you want to see how flawed movies-from-books can be, you're far better off donating the money to the Humanists instead. This is painful.",1188345600,,285,4.607843137254902
2619750,2,B000GUJZF0,"One of the reviewers mentioned David Lynch. I recall waiting with anticipation for the film adaptation of _Dune_, hoping that the movie in my mind would be realized, and discovering through the film flaws in the book that my adolescent mind had not noticed when I fell in love with it. Something like that is true of _The Magus_ as well. It *is* fairly faithful to the book, and many of the more embarrassing scenes of dialogue are taken directly from it. So my first reaction to seeing this film is a troubled sense that I was wrong to love this book.

What's missing? Three things: time, the narrator, and a realist texture. For a sense of what I mean by the third, see Minghella's _Talented Mr. Ripley_ to see how this film should look, should feel (indeed, how, if it were remade today, it could even be cast--all that's missing is Ben Kingsley as Conchis). But what makes the book work is that the fascinating and bizarre events are made plausible by their embedding in a realistic frame: Nicholas' life away from Conchis' universe is utterly real by being largely veiled autobiography. He is the typical callow young man as would-be writer, struggling fitfully to overcome his narcissism and join the human race, while desperately clinging to that same narcissism in the knowledge that only this will allow him to become the artist he would betray himself by not becoming. The Conchis Masque is but the externalization of Nicholas' ""therapy"" as he sorts through this paradox, grows up and becomes a Real Writer. For every Real Writer is perilously close to a merely Failed Human Being.

In the book, Nicholas experiences Bourani (the site of Conchis' manipulations) the way people experience affairs: as what seems for a time an endlessly fascinating distraction from the intolerable experience of being who they are. On this level, the book is essentially the story of an affair, and Nicholas' guilt is an essential part of him finding his way to resolution. But the film so compresses the events that we get only Conchis, only the affair, and almost none of the narcissism, tedium, failure and self-doubt of Nicholas, or the process by which he comes to terms with them through his guilt over how his self-importance and thirst for experience harm the women in his life. And yet it is this which makes the book seem real (especially to the many young Nicholases who read it) and thus confers reality on the otherwise incredible, and incredibly silly things that transpire on the island.

I remain convinced that this film could've been done, but there must be much much more of the ordinariness of Nicholas, so that the fantastic stands out that much more. _French Lieutenant's Woman_ gives us some inkling of how a very free but literate adaptation can be penned, and _Talented Mr. Ripley_ gives us some notion of how it could be shot. But it must be *much* longer, and that length should be devoted to showing what the novel shows: how we grow through love.",1180310400,30,2967,4.757281553398058
2619751,3,B000GUJZF0,"The revised edition of John Fowles novel,The Magus, is one of the best works of fiction I have ever read and contend it as one of my all-time favorites. Have it in my library. Seeing the movie without reading the book is meaningless. But the DVD is worthwhile because of the young performers namely Michael Caine and Candice Bergen. A two hour movie does not do justice to the novel itself. Buy the book or get a copy from the library. The revised edition preferably.",1178668800,4,467,4.5058823529411764
2619752,5,B000GUJZF0,"Michael Caine plays Nicholas Urfe, a shallow, vain English teacher who leaves England to assume a teaching post on the Greek island of Phraxos.  Here he encounters the mysterious Maurice Conchis (Anthony Quinn), who initiates him into a series of bizarre experiences which test his capacity for truth, love, and integrity.

Also in the mix are Ann (Anna Karina), an air hostess (this was the 60s, before we ever heard of ""flight attendants"") whom Urfe has used for his own sexual gratification and callously cast aside, and Lily/Julie (Candice Bergen), a mysterious companion of Conchis who is alternately presented as a mental patient and an actress.  Which is the reality?

And who, or what, is Conchis - psychic, magician, psychiatrist, film producer, madman, charlatan, war criminal, God?  We are kept guessing.

Conchis relates life-changing events in his own past to a skeptical Urfe, who then finds these events inexplicably recreated in his own life.  What is real, what is dream, what is hoax?

The answer, says Conchis, is in the smile, the mystery of life.  The movie is bracketed between a quote from T.S. Eliot's ""Four Quartets"":  ""We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time.""  I am not convinced that the shallow Mr. Urfe actually learns this lesson, but it is quite entertaining to see Conchis trying to teach it.

Yes, it is a movie for thinkers and philosophers, but much more accessible than the mysteries of David Lynch.  And - I must disagree with some reviewers - although this is in many ways a movie about ideas, in no way are the characters stick figures for those ideas.  Anthony Quinn has way too much charisma for that.",1175385600,13,1747,4.818791946308725
2619753,4,B000GUJZF0,"After decades of believing I was the only person in the world who likes this movie, I was shocked to discover that I am not unique.  I had assumed that my copy was the only one in the world, snatched in the dawn of the VCR age from a very late night local airing.  What IS unique is this movie.  It clearly is not for everyone.  It doesn't follow any safe formula, and seems to be cliche-free.  The Magus appeals to people who think with bona fide independence, the kind who write in their choice for President, knowing that it is extremely unorthodox to do so.  I was shocked and still marvel over Anthony Quinn's lament when he explained that answers KILL.  They do.  They kill the mystery in life.  The successive reversals in the movie keep the newness fresh, each offering a new way of interpreting the events thus far.  Before watching the movie, give your left brain the night off and let the wonder of the movie splash over you, augmented by that charming theme by Corelli.  Quinn's consummate acting propels this movie to one that can be savored like a glass of fine wine.  Why not five stars?  Blame it on the NAZI's.",1164067200,7,1127,4.412621359223301
2619754,4,B000GUJZF0,"---I first saw this movie at the theater my second year of college (1968-69) in Texas. At that time, it being the late 1960's, it seemed perfectly normal to me that it was complex and confusing. It was psychedelic. How can anyone who enjoyed the Beatles ""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" and the ""White Album,"" not to mention The Doors' ""Strange Days,"" or Iron Butterfly's ""Inagodadavida"" (sp?), complain about a movie that is confusing?

---Nicholas Urfe (Michael Caine) accepts a job as an English teacher at a private boys school on the idyllic Greek island of Phraxos. As he settles into his room, he finds a cryptic note left in a drawer by his predecessor who had committed suicide. The note reads ""beware the waiting room."" On the weekends Urfe explores the far side of the island and discovers the villa of the mysterious Maurice Conchis (Anthony Quinn) who invites him for weekend visits where Conchis entertains Urfe with his life story. In these stories of his past, Conchis presents to Urfe major dilemmas where the choices are life-changing. Subsequently, in a series of ""Twilight Zonesque"" time shifts, Urfe finds himself trapped into reliving these same stories and being forced to make the same life-changing choices. The effect is, well, ""mind-blowing,"" both for the character Urfe, and for the viewer. Is Urfe hallucinating or dreaming, or is this a well-planned masque, directed by the ""master-manipulator"" Conchis, where Urfe is unwillingly cast as the central character?

---I guess my take on it is that the mind-blowing nature of the film fit very well with the zeitgeist of the late 1960's. The film itself may be lacking, but the greater story, only partly told in an abbreviated version in this movie, is much, much better than could ever be captured on film. Instinctively, I knew this and sought out the book in the Fall of 1969. I found it at Doubleday Bookstore in New York City while visiting for the Texas A&M vs. Westpoint football game. The book helped me survive the long, cold, rainy winter of 1969-70, as I was manipulated into making life-changing decisions -- school vs. Vietnam, girls vs. grades, polyester vs. cotton, Santana vs. Led Zeppelin, etc. etc. etc. As Nicholas Urfe rode the roller coaster of his life, so did we.

---I'm glad to see that the movie is in video.",1161648000,59,2347,4.891959798994975
2619755,3,B000GUJZF0,"This film is intriguing at first, and it's beautiful to look at, but it's a bit of a mess. The problem is simple: John Fowles, the author of the famous novel, decided to write his own screen adaptation. He apparently hated the screen version of his other novel, THE COLLECTOR, three years earlier, and he didn't want Hollywood to botch THE MAGUS. Well, they did botch it--and it's entirely his own fault.

THE MAGUS is a novel of ideas, not action. The flimsy story and symbolic characters (Urfe rhymes with ""earth,"" Conchis is pronounced ""conscious"" which means ""alive,"" the lily in Anne's lucky paperweight becomes ""Lily,"" the girl on the island, etc.) are only there to serve up a large dose of Fowles's philosophy--basically, that life is a dream and love is the only reality. But it isn't exactly photogenic, and Fowles the screenwriter has taken Fowles the novelist entirely too literally. What we get is a page-by-page adaptation of a talky, elliptical, difficult book. If Michael Caine (Urfe/earth), Anthony Quinn (Conchis/life), and Candice Bergen (Lily/love) look uncomfortable, or even downright confused, who can blame them? They were asked to play symbols, not characters, and to say and do things that couldn't possibly make sense to anyone unfamiliar with the novel. A film is not a novel, and vice versa.

Bottom line: read the wonderful novel, then tackle the film. Or skip the film entirely. The screenwriter doesn't seem to understand the novelist, despite the fact that they're the same person. And that is why we have professional screenwriters. I'm glad Fowles allowed Harold Pinter to do the screenplay for the film of his next novel, THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN. Now, there's a movie that does justice to the source material. But as for THE MAGUS, well....",1161043200,22,1782,4.9966329966329965
2619756,2,B000GUJZF0,"I'm 50 pages from completing a Magus marathon. I re-read the revised Magus (1976), then began reading the original again (1965) to identify the revisions. In midst of that, my son bought me the movie (1968?) for Father's Day. Coming between the two print versions, the movie explains how Fowles might have decided to re-write the novel.

The movie is awful, though hardly as awful as the awful Mr. Allen would like you to think. The script (ascribed to Fowles) is the worst of the problems, though the choice of a minor hack director (Guy Green, fresh from A Patch of Blue and Fifty-Five Days at Peking: essentially a Peter Principled cameraman) didn't help, and script changes to accommodate Michael Caine's Cockney accent didn't help (Urfe is the son of a bus driver rather than a brigadier). There are understandable problems with compressing a 600-page novel with many 10-20-page soliloquies into  a 120-150-page script, and rarely does even a professional screenwriter solve them as brilliantly as Harold Pinter did for TFLW. But the huge, unsurmountable problem with the script is hubris, Fowles', pure and simple.

The hubris that failed to grasp what a great job William Wyler (three Best Picture wins behind him and a Best Director nomination for this one) Terence Stamp (Best Actor at Cannes), Samantha Eggar (Best Actress Academy Award nomination and win at Cannes) and screenwriter Stanley Mann (Best Adapted Screenplay nomination) had done. Fowles sulked, during the production and for many years after (partially, we learn from his journals, because he couldn't get into Samantha Eggar's pants). His decision to write his OWN screenplay was the arrogance of the over-praised amateur. Just because he was one of the greatest novelists in English in the 20th C, doesn't mean he could do his own taxes, fix the toilet, or write screenplays. He didn't even LIKE movies!

So we get a script that essentially replaces the story of The Magus with a 2-hour alternate version. It has all the subtlety and grace of a fanboy attempt. The mysteries of the novel are replaced with ""symbols,"" the complexities with blunders (How the Heck did Conchis end up with the paperweight that Ann/Alison said she would never part with, before Conchis even knew about Ann?). It's traditional for super fans (I am, I confess, of the novel) to complain bitterly about every change in the film. But that's not the problem here, the problem is that unlike The Collector and TFLW, this film preserves nothing of the original but the characters and a two-paragraph synopsis. I'm not sure it's possible to make a film of the novel. The story is so profoundly literary. Its effects depend on the effort and time it takes to read the book. In the film, the story appears to happen in the allotted two hours -- that is one of the tiresome illusions of film, that time compressed simply doesn't exist. The action of the book takes an entire year, and it reads like a year. Speeding past like a Disney Nature film's rose, paradox becomes confusion, mysteries are irritants, and there isn't time for Nicholas to fall, much less learn from it.

But there is a bright side to the making of the film. Two, in fact. Fowles learned his lesson, and so we have a great film of a great novel: TFLW. And by attempting to reframe the novel, Fowles found its weak spots. Hence the revised edition. The revisions are extensive, sometimes pages long, sometimes a word here or there ('Circe' is inserted frequently; Fowles is careful to call Lily 'Lily' or 'Julie' consistently), and a few times multi-page embellishments (primarily in conversations with Lily). Nicholas' caddishness is underscored. Maddeningly for some, the ending is still equivocal. Readers simply cannot accept that ""what happened then"" is neither public, germane, nor any of our business; we have been told what we need to know. But setting aside the demand for closure, the revised book makes its points -- about love, identity, integrity -- more effectively.

The movie remains a terrible disappointment. Not because it doesn't do the book justice -- few movies do, and a precious few, like Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, transcend their material -- but because it represents the book at once so badly and so authoritatively (quite literally) that it has driven away potential readers of one of the great English novels of century and, in my view, any century.",1466985600,,4393,4.921727395411606

You have absolutely no idea as to what is real, what is fake, what is staged, what might be hallucination. The story poses many questions about absolute right vs absolute wrong, about reality as fact or perception. Urfe, the immature narcissist, treats his girlfriend, Anne, shabbily, then runs off to teach English at a school in Greece. There he is treated to a dream or nightmare, a reality or hallucination involving love and hate, loyalty and betrayal. Whos is the betrayer? Who is betrayed? The movie doesn't answer these questions. The book, however, ended with Urfe reconciling with Anne believing that they had been the victims of an almost sadistic manipulation. It's almost perfect, even if Urfe is, perhaps, paranoid. The movie ending, meh. In the book the couple moves on. In the movie it becomes a circle where Urfe comes back to a place and sees it for the very first time.

As with any film, one cannot hope to portray the book exactly. Some movies give the feel or outline. Moreover, some movies actually improve on the book. In this case, the movie squeaks by with the basic story and feel.

Michael Caine did a pretty good Nicholas Urfe as I think the person and the character are quite similar. Candice Bergen did a great Lily and could have been the one in the book. The only person that looked physically out of place and tried but did not quite pull it off was Anthony Quinn as Maurice Conchis.

It is open ended and leaves you with either a sense of wonder or confusion.  I saw the film first before I read the novel, so I may not be as biased as some of the reviewers about the film's shortcomings in comparison to the written work.  It is indeed a relatively faithful adaptation of the book, although I understand Fowles was not happy with it.  It is a film in which you are led down a series of garden paths.  The Magus leads the man and reveals all, but wait...he shows a different reality.  So is this the truth?  Each time there is another ""vision"", another play within a play and each time reality bends a little more until you are not sure what is the truth or even if there is any truth in what is shown.  The main character (Caine) is callow and somewhat uncaring, foregoing rather casually his first love, and is entrapped by the Magus's lovely ""niece""(Candace Bergen).  Even though each illusion is revealed as such, it does not destroy the magic, it only makes it seem more mysterious each time.  It is a web of illusion which the man might either see as a privelege or a test.  He is either the butt of a joke or the beneficiary of a play performed on his behalf in which he is the central figure.

At the time it was filmed, the producers didn't have the luxury of pacing it into a limited-run series on HBO/Cinemax/Showtime-------ie, a ten or twenty hour movie which could be spread out over several weekly episodes (much like Masterpiece Theatre did with so many other novels).  So what you've got is a very condensed and edited movie which begs to re-done on cable (the only reason that TWIN PEAKS ended so disasterously in the middle of the second season is that it probably should have been filmed as a year-long, ""finite"" series...but the nature of TV in 1990 was such that no series got produced without a five-year-run in mind).

I first saw this when I was nine or ten, on TV (1972?).  I didn't understand a word of it, but the images never left me.  Three years ago I googled ""Michael Caine, Anthony Quinn"", and finally got the title.  I enjoyed the movie, then ordered the book.

2619788,2,B000GUJZF0,"This is a kind of 60s story - of a surreal psycho-journey that is supposed to lead to profound truths - that appears formulaic now.  Caine is kind of a lost soul, a teacher blundering through life who loves to bed new girls.

Caine then meets a strange man on Crete, Quinn (who isn't all that bad), who enmeshes him in a series of games, enticing him with promises of an affair with a gorgeously young Candace Bergen, and playing with his mind; even the stewardess is somehow involved.  By the end, Caine knows himself better, is less selfish, etc., though may have lost the stewardess.

Viewed from today, this has the air of a cult film, loved by some die hard fans as a deep psychological journey, but seen by everyone else as flat and cliche-ridden, with stilted dialogue and out-dated Jungian themes in the blatantly crude symbolism.  Alas, I fall into the latter category, and not for want of trying.

Nicholas, an invariant liar, particularly to women he wants to seduce, becomes upset with the lies he perceives are being told and enacted upon himself, and as this game called ""the godgame"" becomes more dangerous, he begins to wonder what is real and what is not and whether Conchis is a magician or merely enjoys manipulating people for his own entertainment.",1296345600,,868,4.931506849315069

2619791,3,B000GUJZF0,"For 40 years this film has had to stand as testament to the worst that the industry can concoct, which is constantly reinforced by THAT quotation from Woody Allan. I came to the DVD re-release of `The Magus' like many people, having last read the book quite a few years previously, and with this reputation had fairly low expectations, but in the event viewed the film with interest, and at this distance in time believe there is a case for a reappraisal.

The book is probably impossible to film, certainly within the context of a 2 hour feature, but the production was obviously constructed to be a major work, especially when the author, John Fowles himself came on board as screen writer. The greatest obstacle is that the film is almost incomprehensible to those who have not read the book, and those who know the book are disappointed; the atmosphere and subtlety of the book are not carried through into the film. But at best it couldn't, it's like saying Mozart's 40'th loses depth when rendered down into a pop single using synthesizers.

However the film contains all the essential elements of the book, there are no savage edits to the written material, even the execution scene is well presented. Take it on face value with an open mind. It's probably the only film treatment that will ever be made of The Magus, so make the most of it - consider it as a collection of parts which comprise the main elements of the book, some fit well, other less so, some are downright embarrassing. It is technically well filmed, and for the most part the scenery and staging fits well well with the book. Perhaps the worst aspect is the ludicrous light jazz background music that fouls up the atmosphere that should be coming through - simply re-editing to remove the music, replacing it with something subtle and unintrusive would help the film enormously.

Another problem that was born with the film was the critical barrage that hit it forced all involved in the production to close ranks and vilify their own work for the sake of preserving their professional credibility. Surely after 40 years enough time has passed to look at The Magus in a more benign light",1254787200,,2164,4.689473684210526
2619792,4,B000GUJZF0,"This is one film, based on the excellent existentialist novel by one of the greatest British authors since Thomas Hardy and D.H. Lawrence, that should have been a success. After all, author John Fowles wrote the screenplay himself. Fowles admitted that he greatly admired Lawrence, and it is, therefore, a pity that this film version of his novel didn't turn out as well as film versions of Lawrence's SONS AND LOVERS and WOMEN IN LOVE.

I read the novel before I even went to college and discussed it with some of my newspaper colleagues. I didn't know anything about existentialism or the meta-theatre at the time, but I was still able to enjoy it as a compelling mystery-adventure in which the author took us through a labyrinth of twists and turns that seemed to come to life on the page because of his mastery with visual images. This novel, the first version printed a decade before his revised version, was, I thought, the best literary effort I had read since the American novelist Thomas Wolfe's LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL. Let's face it. Some novels -- as well as some films -- just hit us that way. Sometimes we don't even know why. When the film was released, I saw it with a friend who managed a small movie theatre in St. Charles, Missouri. He was totally lost by it, and like many others whose reviews appear on this page, slammed it mercilessly. I did enjoy the wide-screen vistas and the stunning DeLuxe Color cinematography of the Greek setting. I was impressed with how the scenes with the fake Nazi soldiers were contrasted with the scenes, from Conchis' memory, of the real Nazi soldiers, and of how the mystical figures from arcane mythology were brought to life for Urfe, played by Michael Caine in his salad days. I didn't hate the film as many others have, including Woody Allen. I just saw it as something different from the novel.

The extent to which readers are invited, or even required, to participate in a novel may actually be detrimental to a film adaptation.  A novel such as THE MAGUS, which emphasizes participation in the narrative more than explanations and literal interpretations -- which involves readers experientially as well as intellectually -- creates its own deep impressions. Where these impressions are caused by the novel's imagery, conflicts may arise when the reader contrasts his/her mental image with the actual image produced on the theatre screen. If, for example, we agree with critics who feel that director Guy Green's straightforward point of view provides an objective, documentary realism, then we might find his filming of Fowles' script to be an odd mix when combined with the subjective flashbacks. One flashback, in fact, combines Conchis' reminiscences of his meeting and courting Lily (played in typical stiff fashion by Candice Bergen)  -- told in silent images with Anthony Quinn's voice-over narration -- with images of authentic-looking enlistment posters superimposed over black-and-white drawings and newsreel-type footage of the First World War.

Other reviewers have compared this to a David Lynch film, and it does create an entertaining moment or two for us to speculate on what Lynch might have done with the material. At the time, the late sixties, someone even wondered what the film might have been like if Byron Forbes had directed this film, instead of Guy Green, in the style that he had directed DEADFALL about the same time -- with its flourishes of quick cutting and inter-cutting, beautiful images of Spain, and its soundtrack lushly filled with John Barry's haunting music. Maybe Forbes and Barry would have improved this film, and maybe Lynch could, today, give it the quirkiness that Fowles blueprints for us, but this isn't want happened. Critic John Russell Taylor even wonders what a Federico Fellini would have done with the complex story.

Green may resist throwing a circus of special effects at us, spicing up the complex tale with surrealistic wide-angle shots and zoom shots, but his point of view is hardly objective. Those critics who fault his point of view should not forget that Urfe's narrative in the novel is chronological, particularly as it details aspects of his early life. Only Conchis' installments of his early life, which exist as descriptively delineated stories within the larger story of Urfe's experience, disrupt the narrative structure. Green's film, in fact, dispenses with the book's lengthy beginning in London and uses flashbacks to deal with the necessary exposition. Immediately in the film we are shown a few 1960-ish quick cuts to show Urfe's thoughts, and though this technique does not occupy the majority of the film, it is effective as a tantalizing beginning.

Perhaps I defend this film THE MAGUS because I waited a long time for it, as well as Forbes' DEADFALL, to appear on DVD.  Finally, long after I needed it for my dissertation on John Fowles, which later became the book POINT OF VIEW IN FICTION AND FILM: FOCUS ON JOHN FOWLES (sorry for the shameless plug for a work that is no longer in print), the DVD appeared. Seeing it on a sharp-imaged, wide-screen DVD after many years -- even after Fowles revised his own novel in the last 1970s long after the film version that was based on his first version -- was thrilling. It was fun to see Urfe (Caine) again read the quote from T.S. Eliot from a book conveniently left on the beach with a ribbon indicating a significant passage for him; it was fun because I had studied Eliot in the intervening years and now had a new appreciation for why this one quote was significant to Urfe's (Caine's) character.

Maybe someday the BBC will film a longer version and add the necessary scenes that were omitted from this version, but this is outside speculation. We must, in a true existential sense, deal with what we have. After all, we have seen countless other films that received higher praise that probably did not deserve it. We have seen garbage movies thrown onto a DVD for no visible reason other to make a buck or two. THE MAGUS, at least, whatever its perceived faults, is a classy production with a young Michael Caine, the always superb Anthony Quinn, and the lovely Anna Karina (Mrs. Jean-Luc Godard) who plays Urfe's original love interest as French instead of the Australian air hostess that she is in the book.

But if the BBC doesn't make a satisfying version of this modern classic, call David Lynch.",1249516800,3,6396,4.870404411764706
2619793,4,B000GUJZF0,"There are certain works of art that are enormously flawed, because their creators take ridiculous risks that don't always succeed, glorious leaps that sometimes end with inglorious splats on a very hard floor. Yet at the same time, that willingness to fail on such a large scale also leads to something dazzling & compelling.

And so it is with ""The Magus.""

Let's agree that the film is so much less than the book -- how could it be otherwise? So let's simply look as the film as a film. It's a sun-drenched puzzle with a few crucial pieces missing, and others that never quite fit together. Granted, that's not entirely a bad thing, as the god-game of the trickster Conchis is to constantly unmoor Nicholas Urfe's sense of mundane reality & then expand it. Urfe is left confused, bewildered, angry, but eager to learn more -- and so are we, although we also want more when the film ends. Again, not entirely a bad thing.

The film has to walk a narrow line, and it stumbles on occasion. If it gives too much information, lays out things too explicitly, it succumbs to rigidity & mere didacticism. But if it lets things get too loose & fluid, then it can't do any better than disconnected glimpses that don't cohere on a deeper level. The film never quite reaches the perfect balance between the two. To be honest, I don't know that it ever could.

So is it worth watching?

I think so ... with a couple of caveats. It's definitely a film of the 1960s, which may be the deciding factor for some prospective viewers in itself. For those who want to understand how the 1960s felt, how some people viewed & experienced the world, it's a kaleidoscopic window on a disorienting landscape. For those who enjoy Big Questions & surreal situations, you'll certainly get your fill ... if not complete satisfaction. For those who want specific answers, though, or a stronger narrative hand at the wheel, it's likely to be disappointing -- and with just cause for complaint. And those who loved the novel will need to lower their expectations considerably!

Michael Caine has said that nobody on the set understood what the film was about, which is why it failed. Even so, he gives a wonderfully befuddled performance as a very smart (but emotionally shallow) man, one who learns that he isn't quite as smart as he thought. Anthony Quinn is bursting with energy, laughter, menace, and hidden wells of sorrow -- he's a presence that overflows from the screen. And Candice Bergen, while in an underwritten role, is the right choice for an impossibly beautiful figure of desire & mystery.

Not for everyone, obviously -- and even those who like it will have some reservations. But if you're in the mood to try something different, this is a great place to take a chance!",1236211200,5,2756,4.658436213991769

2619795,3,B000GUJZF0,"I stole the title of this review from another reviewer here who made the point that the style and themes of this film were hot in the 60's.  ""Nothing's what it seems to be...Life is just a dream, etc.""  With some sex and nudity thrown in.

I read the book when it first came out and was entranced by it!  'Don't think I've ever seen the film till now...if I did, it didn't make much of an impression on me.  I found the beginning to be quite interesting.  Michael Caine plays the callow but possibly-talented underachiever very well.  Anna Karina is beautiful and gives her usual soulful performance.  Anthony Quinn is perfect for his role, which is more of a type than an actual person.  Candace Bergen looks good  and her rather wooden style of acting is ok for this part.

The story is really interesting and I have the feeling that (again, to quote another reviewer) it could have been a wonderful film.  What that would have taken I don't know.  Perhaps it's presented in too literal a style for a tale that is about not taking things so literally?  I'm not sure, but whatever it would take, this version didn't deliver it.

We are presented with one version of ""reality"" after another.  Just when we think that the previous versions were not real and the present one is, then another skin of the onion is peeled off and we are perplexed again.  The problem I had was that I just lost interest in the whole game way before the conclusion.

The ideas presented are worthy of thought.  I particularly liked what Anne, the French stewardess, told Niko, that there was something in the core of everyone that has never been touched by anything horrible.  This is pure Course in Miracles and I was happy to see it mentioned here.  It is certainly meritorious to see the callow Niko come to terms with his past behavior, but I wasn't really convinced that he actually changed.  The ideas are bogged down by so much hokey ""magic"" and visual shlock that I could no longer care what the heck was going on.  The film seemed awfully long to me, too.

8134745,1,B000GUJZF0,"Forgotten movie based on forgotten best seller (except by people old enough to have read it when it originally came out apparently, based on some other Amazon reviews that were posted) about a teacher played by Michael Caine who goes to work in Greece to escape a bad relationship with an airline hostess played by Anna Karina.  We eventually find out that the relationship failed because Michael Caine's character is a thoroughly selfish jerk, which doesn't make him a particularly sympathetic protagonist.

The teacher meets a man who lives in a large villa on a hill (Anthony Quinn) who plays elaborate mind games with the teacher and might have been involved with the suicide of Caine's predecessor at the school.  Quinn's character keeps lying about who he is and what he's doing, which is supposed to make him clever or mysterious or something.  He also meets a beautiful woman played by Candice Bergen who is staying in Anthony Quinn's villa and is involved in some way with the games and whose story also keeps changing.

To say that there is less going on here than meets the eye would be giving the movie way too much credit--there's pretty much nothing going on at all beyond a lot of pretentious, pseudo-intellectual nonsense that is apparently supposed to be enlightening and profound.  Well, The Magus was made in 1968 and it's certainly a product of its times.

The film wastes its chief virtues--Michael Caine in his prime, a charming and briefly nude Anna Karina and what should be lovely Greek locations, although The Magus might as well take place on TV's cheesy Fantasy Island for all the use director Guy Green makes of his sourroundings.  Anthony Quinn has zero range and is one of those love him or hate him actors whose appeal I never understood.  Candice Bergen eventually found her niche as a fine comic actress but in early dramatic roles, she was generally in over her head.  It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't give the far more beguiling Anna Karina her part instead.
