8539464,5,B001UFD0Y2,"I have owned this DVD for about 2 years and have consulted it to learn about pruning trees and other aspects of land management.  It is quite applicable to homeowners with a small piece of land, as well as to those who own acreage.  Anyone with a tree in the yard and bushes at the perimeter can profit by purchasing Demystifying Woods.  The clarity is great!  Best of all, the techniques are demonstrated thoroughly.  I recommend it highly.",1237507200,4,441,4.602564102564102
