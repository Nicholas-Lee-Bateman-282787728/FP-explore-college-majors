8354997,3,B0027P9NKY,Nice to see again but quality sucks too high on the brightness. Idiot who ripped us off should be ashamed of his quality.,1302825600,,121,4.304347826086956
8354998,5,B0027P9NKY,"Frank Sinatra was one of the all time greats, and he had some of the most important people in the music industry on his show. In one episode, he welcomes home Elvis Presley from his military stint. He is joined by Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, and Nancy Sinatra. Sammy is great as he performs a number from Porky and Bess. Elvis, is of course amazing. Another episode has Bing Crosby, and Dean Martin. There are some lesser known stars too, remember June Hutton, Dagmar, or Hermione Gingold? The music is great, but the image isn't very sharp as these are kinescopes from the fifties. Still it's an amazing array of talent in these shows.",1302652800,10,653,4.589743589743589
