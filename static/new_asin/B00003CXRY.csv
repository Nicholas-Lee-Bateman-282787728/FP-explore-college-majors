1321811,4,B00003CXRY,"Two hours and fifteen minutes of racy (for the first half) comedy/drama.  Towards the end the movies starts to drag a bit.  Trying my best not to overstep the boundaries of giving away some of the best surprises, let me tell you just this that you won't really regret sitting through despite of it being so lengthy.
This movie has its funny moments between the characters of Julia Roberts playing Sam and Brad Pitt playing Jerry Welbach, a couple although madly in love but still having trouble.  Punch Line of their relationship is when Sam asks Jerry, ""When two people love each other and cant seem to get along when is it time to say enough?""  Jerry's answer is the defining moment of their relationship.
Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts do not share the frame much in this movie as they are separated earlier in the film when Jerry is sent for a job to Mexico and many ill-fated events follow.  Meanwhile Sam takes of to Las Vegas to pursue her dream and midway is kidnapped by a hit man sent by Jerry's boss due to his inability to deliver, played by James Gandolfini.  On this frame develops a very interesting relationship between the hostage and her captor.
It's a wonderful movie with romance, comedy, drama, thrill all packed up in one.",984182400,7,1241,4.5675675675675675
1321812,4,B00003CXRY,"To be honest, I've not seen very many Brad Pitt movies, so, I was  a little reluctant to see this movie in light of that. Now, after seeing this movie, I have a much bigger respect for him. Still, it's not the best movie ever made. With a great plot, and great acting, this movie falls short of a comedy. While it has many funny moments, most of them are shown on the preview, so, when you see it, you won't see a whole lot of surprise gags. There's a few, some extremely funny, but not a whole lot. But this is okay, because it's not a straight-out comedy, it's an action/romance/comedy-one of the best I've seen.",983836800,,614,4.247863247863248
1321813,4,B00003CXRY,"A couple working on the give-and-take aspects of their relationship, an exquisitely crafted antique pistol with something of a diverse history and some questions concerning who is working for whom, all figure prominently in ""The Mexican,"" a black comedy directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt.  Jerry Welbach (Pitt), a somewhat less than astute young fellow in thrall to a criminal currently incarcerated, is given a seemingly simply assignment:  He is to go to Mexico, where he will rendezvous at a bar in a small town, at which time he will take possession of an invaluable hand-made pistol; he will then transport the item to the States and deliver it to his boss.  But there's a problem; his girlfriend, Samantha (Roberts) expects to go to Las Vegas at the same time, and their plans were already made and set in stone.  So what is a guy to do?  After Sam throws him out of their apartment and Jerry tries to explain-- in a memorable scene with her on the second story balcony, he on the ground looking up-- that if he doesn't do this job they will, well, KILL him, it doesn't make any difference.  After all, their trip to Vegas had already been planned, and he promised it would happen.  Talk about a guy between a rock and a hard place.  And it's only the beginning of a dark comedy of errors and circumstances that ultimately involves them with some double dealings and brings them into contact with a psychotic killer named Leroy (James Gandolfini).  Director Verbinski lends a nice touch to the movie, eliciting noteworthy performances from his actors and establishing early on his method of using specific landmarks-- a traffic signal and a cross-roads in the middle of nowhere, for example-- that give context and definition to what is happening, sometimes off-screen (as in the opening scene, when you only ""hear"" a traffic accident that becomes a pivotal part of the story).  He avoids slapstick and plays up the natural, subtle humor that drives the film.  The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is clever and witty (""You `Forrest Gumped' your way through this..."") and often very droll.  And he maintains a pace and develops an atmosphere in which the unexpected can be expected that keeps it all moving along nicely and right on track.  And there's a politically incorrect sensibility to the movie that is refreshing to see; in real life certain situations and cultures that are foreign to us are often viewed in stereotypical terms, so there is no reason to portray it otherwise in a film, especially when care has been taken to present it in an inoffensive manner, as it is here.  Taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, Roberts nevertheless creates a lively character with Sam, imbuing her with plenty of spunk and, of course, that trademark smile.  It's not a part that calls for a lot of depth, but she makes Sam likable and fun to watch, and she makes her banter with Jerry and Leroy credible and engaging.  Credit goes to Pitt, as well, for making the most of what is actually a leading man/character role; Jerry isn't the sharpest tool in the shed and he may be easily distracted, but-- like Sam-- he's not without some natural charm that makes him quite personable and interesting.  And there is a chemistry between the two that makes their relationship believable, especially when the sparks are flying.  Gandolfini, meanwhile, not to be outdone by his charismatic co-stars, makes an indelible mark as the sensitive, psychotic killer who turns out to be something of an enigma.  The supporting cast includes Bob Balaban (Nalin), David Krumholtz (Beck), Luis Felipe Tovar (Luis) and Gene Hackman (Margolis).  A lively romp that takes some unexpected turns, ""The Mexican"" has a dark side, but manages to remain uplifting and thoroughly entertaining.  There's a natural flow to the film and the laughs, generated by both the situations and the characters, are never forced but prompted, rather, by the spontaneity of it all.  It's a movie that never pretends to be anything other than what it is, which is pure entertainment.  It'll leave you with a smile on your face, some chuckles and some great lines to quote.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.",983836800,2,4226,4.821329639889196
1321814,4,B00003CXRY,"There was no way this movie could go wrong...with the star power of Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt, plus a unique and fresh plot, this was a sure-fire hit...I enjoyed the film as much as i knew I would...extremely good performances, believable and lovable characters all contribute to the brilliance of the screenplay...I have never had so much fun at the movies...a very refreshing experience after falling asleep during Hannibal and The Wedding Planner, I was glad to see that Hollywood can still make feel good enjoyable films...this is one movie I would definitely recommend...",983750400,,578,5.094736842105263
1321815,1,B00003CXRY,"I'm going to try to be objective here but ""The Mexican"" was such a dreadfully awful film, it's not going to be easy.

For starters, the use of foul language--prevelant in many of today's movies--was far more pronounced in ""The Mexican."" It added zero to the film and, in my opinion, was analogous to the filthy language found in rap music marketed towards children: It's there for the shock value and nothing else. To give you an idea, we weren't even five minutes into the film and I had already logged about two dozen needless utterances of the ""F"" word. The script writers should find another line of work.

OK...excessive use of bad language is annoying, but the acting was good, right? Wrong. The acting was horrible, and that's no small thanks to Brad Pitt, one of the worst actors to ""grace"" Hollywood in years. Unfortunately, even Julia Roberts blew it bigtime on this one, dumbing down--way down--her acting talents to be more in line with those of Pitt. And it didn't work. The argument scenes between Pitt and Roberts, for example, were so ridiculously fake and overacted they were embarrassing to watch. To make matters worse, I found zero chemistry between Pitt and Roberts. And don't even get me started on the ""tender"" scenes between the ""sensitive"" cold-blooded homosexual ""Leroy,"" and Roberts' character, Sam. As I said, I'm trying to be objective.

About the only bright spot for me was the soundtrack. I've always loved the sounds of Mexico, and the powerful and emotion-filled brass-based score in ""The Mexican"" was beautiful to the ears. Unfortunately, Hollywood once again portrayed Mexicans as a bunch of lazy, dirty drunks living their lives on the streets and in saloons. These stereotypical views are unnecessary and damaging, and I regret we have to see them here in 2001.

To summarize, this poor excuse of a movie was one of the worst I've ever had to suffer through. It was pointless, sleazy (do we really need 4 different scenes of urination or defecation?), graphically violent, and inane. Intellectually speaking, you'd be better off watching re-runs of the ""Dukes of Hazard.""",983750400,5,2109,4.915730337078652
1321816,3,B00003CXRY,"I checked out THE MEXICAN this weekend and I thought it was a good movie. BRAD PITT playes this guy named Jerry who happens to get a job to go to Mexico to retrieve a valuable pistol. JULIA ROBERTS plays a women named Sam who is Jerrys girlfriend. At the start of the movie you can tell the couple have some tension in there relationship, Sam tells Jerry if he goes to Mexico she is going to go to Las Vegas to pursue her career. Along the way Sam gets kidnapped by a guy who is working for the guy who hired Jerry to go to Mexico. This movie is a good movie, but you hardly see BRAD and JULIA together in the movie, only at the start for a few minutes than again at the end for a few more minutes. I have to be honest this movie is not BRAD PITTS or JULIA ROBERTS best movie. I was expecting more, but instead I got less. I left the movie feeling like I was let down, and so did the two people that went with me. For the sake of me being a huge BRAD PITT and JULIA ROBERTS fan I say check it out, but don't expect to much.",983664000,5,1023,3.853080568720379
1321817,5,B00003CXRY,"This movie was fabulous. I always love to see any movie with Brad and Julia, but together they are double the enjoyment. The plot is great and makes you want to stay with the entire movie. Brad was very funny and not to mention looked amazing (as always). Julia was very delightful and beautiful. The relationship that grew between her character Sam and James Gandolfini (Leroy/Winston) was great. James Gandolfini is a fabulous actor and gave that slightly rough edge the movie needed. I can't wait for it to come to DVD, but I would definitely go to the theater two or three more times just for the shear pleasure of seeing this delicious film again.

THE MEXICAN is notable for a fine cast, plus an unusual dual storytelling technique that's done on two levels: modern/historic and modern/modern.

At any rate, I hope he had a better last career film than this one. Presumably, Roberts and Pitt were paid their customary mega-sums for the time they put in, I have not seen much of either, but I cannot imagine that Roberts ever came off looking more pathetically inept than she does here. There were a few breaks in the tedium of her performance; just the briefest reminder of her  very real beauty and talent. Oh, well, into each life some rain must fall, and, at least, she must have had fun cashing the checks (or, knowing that they were being deposited in her account). Pitt I may have seen in other things but cannot remember which they could have been. Actually, their situation, I just recall as I type, is very much that of Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beattie, in the world class stinker they made some years ago.
There were so many inadvertently funny things that I can list only two: one was the deeply moving folk-tale of the gun, which is given the old Rashomon treatment, and, the second, is the resonant score underlying the last few minutes, in which the culminating scenes take place, (accompanied, of course, by chorus), just as if this was Bogart and Rains walking off into the world beyond Casablanca, once more to defeat the Nazis through courage and keen wit.",1319760000,,1391,4.51984126984127

There were a few funny moments where Pitt revived his role as the crazy guy from 12 Monkeys, but most of the movie was a real bore. Tony Soprano was in the movie as a gay hit man. Very weird seeing him play the ""sensitive"" role. The movie had a strange vibe, I'd call it Drama-Comedy?",1269043200,,371,4.166666666666667
1322856,5,B00003CXRY,"A number of people completely pan this movie, and after reading almost all of the one- and two-star reviews, I think I understand why. You see, Hollywood doesn't usually come out with an art film, and when they do, nobody seems to know what to do. I am in an almost unique position in that I don't watch any television at all, and so I do not see movie ads and trailers. I also do not listen to the radio, and do not hear movie critics. When I go see a movie, I could care less who wrote it, directed it, filmed it or starred in it. The movie either gets me, or it doesn't. End of story. ""The Mexican"" definitely gets me.

The words ""art film"" are thrown around a lot. In this case, I'm using one of the definitions that surfaced in the late 70s, which basically states that an art film is one which spends less time creating a believable plot and more time focusing on the internals of the characters. Think of a movie like ""A Life Less Ordinary"". I'm not saying that this is the correct definition of an art film, I'm just saying that this is the one I'm using here.

During ""The Mexican"", we get to see legends from the past as they are represented in the minds of the storytellers. We also get to see quirky events from the past and present which apply directly to the main theme of the film while having no rational explanation (a traffic light mysteriously malfunctioning as we here an off-screen car accident, for example). The writers don't need to apologize for this: the style of the movie is blatantly declaring, ""I am an art film. Do not judge me on my realism, judge me on my characters."" The people who criticize the legend of the pistol as presented in this movie might just as well criticize the future presented in the movie Wall-E. It's not about the realism, it's about the characters!

I like Brad Pitt in most of his films, and I dislike Julia Roberts in most of her films. In this film, the two were the right actors to play the right characters. I don't even need to sing the praises of our hitman -- an incredible performance is expected, and an incredible performance is delivered.

The cinematography is beautiful. The movie just ends up feeling so organic. It seems that the moments of brutal violence are set so that they get your heart rate up at just the moments the director intended. I think some of the other reviewers were expecting a Hollywood movie to stick to its ""every bullet blows something up"" roots, but the violence in this movie is actually about as true to life as I have seen in a Hollywood movie (that is to say, nothing like most other Hollywood movies). The violence in this movie seems to follow the old aphorism, ""hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror"". For a movie of this sort, the violence is perfectly balanced to the story, without an ounce too much or too little.

""The Mexican"" requires at least two watches to fully appreciate the depth of the love story -- both of present and of legend -- and to appreciate the simple beauty of the film, in all its sound and color. I can understand why many people would dislike this film. It is not for everyone. It is like many other types of art: it is either your style, or it's not. For example, I think the world would have been better off if Picasso had never been born. On the other hand, I am utterly fascinated by Monet's use of light in his paintings. Some people are the exact opposite. This is a movie that you will either love, or hate, and if you love it as I do, you will truly love it.",1237334400,3,3514,4.334346504559271
1322857,4,B00003CXRY,"May not be an epic master piece, but this movie is not bad at all. If you put Tarratino and Robin Williams in the same room and make them come up with a movie this is what you will get. A smart action comedy that is right up there with Grosse Point Blank and the Whole nine yards. I cant believe that so many people despise it. I give it atleast 3.75 to 4 stars easily. If you want to sit down a sip some tequila and have a good time, I reccomend this movie. Now if you want to nit pick and gripe about a movies imperfections all day I still reccomend it, after all its not my fault you got bad taste. don't pay attention to all the bad pub though not a classic its no way near deserving of 1 star not even 2.

1322859,4,B00003CXRY,"I hadn't heard many good things about `The Mexican' and so I somewhat shelved the idea of ever even trying to watch it.  It had come on television multiple times and I just ignored the very thought of wasting two hours of my life on it.  And then, while carousing through my local video store I decided to actually read the back of the DVD case and I noticed the name of an actor whom I am eternal smitten with.  James Gandolfini.  Immediately I walked up to the checkout line and rented this film.  I can honestly say now, Gandolfini aside, `The Mexican' was a lot of fun.  I actually enjoyed this film far more than I ever expected.  The plot, while a bit forced and a little improbable, is full of twists and turns, but what makes the film so enjoyable and memorable at that is the onscreen chemistry, not between Pitts and Roberts as may be assumed, but between Roberts and Gandolfini, a pairing that was made in Hollywood heaven!

Brad Pitt plays Jerry, a careless man who got caught up with a gangster due to a car accident and is now paying off his debt to the man by carrying out small errands.  His latest errand is to retrieve a beautifully crafted gun coined `the Mexican' that has about as much history to it as it does value.  The job gets botched though when Jerry gets carjacked and loses the gun.  As he tries to retrieve it himself his boss Arnold Margolese takes matters into his own hands by hiring a contract killer named Leroy to kidnap Jerry's girlfriend Samantha and hold her as hostage to trade out for the gun.  Jerry's friend Ted also ventures into Mexico to help Jerry retrieve the gun.

Know that all the above information is subject to change, for this is an action/comedy with twists and turns in the plot that will alter the reality of my initial synopsis.  In other words, what I just wrote is what the film wants you to believe.

What makes `The Mexican' such a fun and memorable film is the keen eye for character development.  Maybe no so much on the part of Jerry, but the characters of Samantha and Leroy really get fleshed out.  That is owed in large part to the wonderful performances by Julia Roberts and James Gandolfini.  As Samantha, Roberts is at her zany best.  I actually haven't seen her this much fun since her `Pretty Woman' days.  She was perfect in her role, hilarious and just orgasmically entertaining.  Speaking of orgasmic, James Gandolfini is just utter perfection here as Leroy.  His sensitive killer is a great spin off from his portrayal of Tony Soprano.  He plays Leroy a bit softer than he plays Tony, but the same sentimental elements are still there which work wonders for making Leroy a real person.  His relationship with Sam is so believable you almost want them to end up together (impossible for reasons you'll soon uncover) instead of Sam and Jerry.

So, in conclusion, `The Mexican' is not a bad film at all.  Let go of any and all preconceived notions about this being a waste of time and give it a chance.  It's highly entertaining and will prove to be a great time for everyone involved.  Here's to hoping that Gandolfini gets more roles like this one now that his `Sopranos' career has ended.  He's a very talented actor who shines above the rest here and deserves to remain in the limelight.",1189382400,2,3266,4.497453310696095
1322860,3,B00003CXRY,"I bought this DVD for a single scene I had seen once.  The scene was worth purchasing the DVD, or so I thought.  Wrong! Much of the movie was worth the price of the DVD.  Actually, I more than got my money's worth.  The acting is great, the plot is a great tease, and it never stops moving.  I would have given it 4 stars, but the language was unnecessarily much thicker than I cared for.  But all in all, a VERY solid movie.",1181433600,2,425,4.0
1322861,2,B00003CXRY,"WARNING!  THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!

Brad Pitt is utterly irresistable as the hapless Jerry.  I am continually amazed that someone as good looking as Brad can convincingly play such backward people  (Think 12 Monkeys, Snatch, Fight Club, etc).

Julia is Julia.  She's fluffy, adorable, and like Brad, a beautiful person playing a kind of dork--she's not as convincing as Brad, but still good.

James Gandolfini steals the show.  He's wonderful, lovable, and the chemistry between him and Julia is great.  HOWEVER, just when you're completely in love with him, and you're thinking he's the greatest thing in the movie, Brad's character, Jerry, shoots him dead.

What were the producers thinking?  To kill off the character that everyone loves the most?  Didn't they have a test audience?  Couldn't they have given him a bulletproof vest and shown him walking away at the end?  Wasn't it enough that they killed off his boyfriend?  Did they have to kill him too?

I probably would have given the movie 4 stars if they hadn't killed him off.  If you don't mind movies where the main character is unexpectedly offed, then you'll love this film.  Not for me.",1169510400,4,1158,4.9119170984455955

Because of these scenes it made me think that this movie should not have named The Mexican, it should have named ""Toilet"" or ""Ugly Toilet"" or ""Toilet Exchangers"". There was not a single character in this movie whom the director did  not show us going to the toilet. One character comes out of the toilet and the other goes in and this carries on making the viewer think that they do not have any thing else to do. This was an ugliest and worst movie i have seen in my life time. This was an ugly movie by ugly Americans named ""The Mexican"". I think Mexicans should have sued the director.

What you need to know about this movie before seeing it is this:

1. Everybody loves Julia Roberts, even Mexicans.

2. Brad Pitt is like a male Julia Roberts.

3. If you think Ocean's Twelve is brilliant...wait till you see this hunk of work.

4. Don't drink the water!  (Ha, ha.  That's a Mexican joke).

5. Movies about guns are always excellent, despite what Michael Moore may say.  If he's so smart, how come people don't love him as much as they do Brajulia?  Because clearly they're smarter.

In conclusion, James Gandolfini will always be remembered most for his work in this neo-classic, which makes movies like ""North by Northwest"" and ""It Happened One Night,"" seem terrible in comparison.",1153180800,,879,4.754966887417218

I thought it would be some sort of hollow, all about the action and/or SEXY relationship between the two lovely stars, but it was the total opposite of that.  From reading some of the other reviews, I got the idea that the reason some people didn't like this movie was because it couldn't be easily classified under romantic comedy, or action.

  The thing that makes this movie so great is that it has so many elements.  It's exciting and romantic.  But it's not trying too hard that either get annoying.  It's not just some mindless action/romantic comedy.  It had plot, it had twists and turns, and it had depth.  Most importantly, it had a great big dose of character development!

  Parts of this movie are funny, and parts of it are a little wacky, but in the end, this movie is about people trying to get by with all the crap life has thrown at them.  And the journey it wonderful.",1125100800,3,1007,4.396739130434782
1322952,3,B00003CXRY,"Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts in their first film together! It will be the Romance of the Century. Well, no. The makers of ""The Mexican"" have created a film in which the two leads spend the majority of the film apart. Folly? Well, no.

Jerry (Pitt) is a low-level errand boy for some local gangsters. He promises his self-help crazed girlfriend, Sam (Roberts), that he will settle down and find a respectable job, leaving that life behind. Jerry's boss has other ideas. Jerry must make one last run to pay him back for all of the jobs Jerry has screwed up. Jerry must go to Mexico to retrieve a legendary pistol called `The Mexican'. Sam is fed-up and leaves for Vegas without Jerry. Jerry heads for Mexico and runs into many complications. One of these complications is that Sam is kidnapped by Leroy (James Gandolfini), a hit man hired by Jerry's boss to babysit Sam and ensure that Jerry is successful.

""The Mexican"" is essentially two road movies. The story of Jerry's trip to Mexico and Sam's trip to Vegas are told concurrently for much of the film. Each story is interesting and, at times, funny. But what these stories do is keep the two stars apart for all but about 30 minutes of the film. The two stories are well-told, but it seems odd that the two actors are apart.

The Mexican is a legendary pistol. The legend behind the firearm is told more than once, each time the legend changes. As we watch these stories unfold, sepia-toned images play out as old newsreels or home movies. This is a nice touch. As the movie tells a story that is slightly over the top, these fable segments help to ground the rest of the film.

Roberts is funny. She plays a fairly high maintenance woman. During the course of the film, she manages to make the audience care about the character. This is a real accomplishment given our initial impression of her character. Pitt is also good. A low-life but likable enough character.

James Gandolfini is superb. Leroy's job is to grab Sam and hold her as insurance. As she spouts her self-help-isms, Leroy's inner-self is drawn to her. As they become friends, his professional life begins to conflict with his personal life. As they become friends, they share personal things which surprise us and make us laugh.

To pay for his error - has has to provide some services to the gang until the head gangster is out of jail. His last task is to bring back the Mexican - a gun held in Mexico by the gangster's grandson.

His only bit of good luck in life is his girlfriend, Samantha (Julia roberts) - whose dream of moving to Vegas is almost shattered by Jerry's latest trip, so the couple has a big fight & splits up just before Jerry leaves for Mexico.

But the gang doesn't know about this - so Samantha is kidnapped to ensure Jerry performs his job well. Naturally - the hapless Jerry manages to get himself into trouble while samantha has gone on a journey of self discovery - not only for herself, but also for her kidnapper.

Gandolfini plays a mob thug who discusses emotions with Roberts after kidnapping her.  If that sounds a lot like an episode of The Sopranos, you're right.

1322959,2,B00003CXRY,"Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts star in this dark comedy/low budget action movie. ''The Mexican'' is about a guy named Jerry (Pitt) who works for a crime boss. One day the crime boss, asks Jerry for one last ''job'' before Jerry decides to quit working for him and pay of his debts. The ''job'' though isn't as easy as Jerry thinks it is. He is asked to find a rare gun that is worth alot of money in Mexico.
Jerry's girlfriend , a nieve and spoiled brat named Samantha (Roberts fits the role perfectly ) reacts to Jerry last job like a bat out of hell. She immediately tells Jerry that if he goes to this job that she will never take him back, and to not both coming to her. The character of Samantha is as shallow and mean as a woman can get, I almost get shivers down my spine when I think that women like Samantha exist, because they aren't worth fighting for.
What Samantha doesn't realize is that Jerry is doing this job for her out of love. Jerry wants to pay his debts , and to pay of this debts requires doing this job in Mexico.
Pitt while not being the charasmatic actor, does at least add some depth and character to Jerry.
Anyhow once Jerry arrives in Mexico (a pretty dangerous place in some areas, but enjoyable in others) meets his contact who is going to give the rare gun to him.
However, things go horribly wrong when the contact Jerry is with literally dies
in front of him during a midnight celebration in Mexico. Jerry at first does not know the guy is dead, until he notices the bloody headshot on the car seat where he places the body in!!! Uggh.
This is only the start of a bad situation for Jerry. Once Jerry's crime boss finds out that he has fowled things up (although it's not his fault this guy is dead) sends in a psychopath killer named Leroy (James Gandolfini ) to hold his girlfriend Sam as hostage, while Jerry tries to come back to his boss with the antique gun.
One of the big problems the Mexican is the load of unlikeable characters in the
film. Brad Pitt's character of Jerry is probably the only somewhat likeable character in the film. Julia Roberts (again in her usual uncharasmatic self) as Sam, doesn't really
show any love or compassion only up to the point where she herself becomes involved in Jerry's situation. She only really cares about herself.
Then there's Gandolifini's character who can be best characterized as self hypocriting homosexual, hitman. which in fact he is if you watch the whole film. Gandolfini is best known for playing the paranoid , lovable, and evil Tony Soprano in the Sopranos but his role in that overrated, and his role in this film is forgettable.
The Mexican is not a total waste of a film, although much of it is.
I loved the twists in the film that the Mexican's in the film, from the villages to the cops were smarter than the dumb gringo (Jerry) who comes to look for the ancient gun for his boss. In fact, the Mexican's gave me such a good laugh, that I thought they were probably the best actors in the film. Every stereotype that Jerry and his white crime buddies put on them is eventually thrown back in their face with big laughs.
That's all I can say, I won't spoil it though by going into the exact dialogue. The film also has a couple of good twists in the middle, and near the end. However, the Mexican though has so many problems with it, that keep it from leaving a lasting impression and making it a likeable film that I can't recommend buying.
Renting it though is a different matter, you'll probably get some good laughs from it like I did, but that's it.
As Roger Ebert would say ''Two Thumbs Down'' but give it a viewing however don't expect to be blown away by this low budget film because you wont.",1088640000,4,3696,4.365747460087083

It`s a decent effort, but the characters aren`t very intriguing (Pitt plays a dumb pretty boy, Roberts is in another bland role and only James Gandolfini, the best element here, truly convinces as an interesting gay hitman), the plot is full of ups and downs and it runs for way too long. At parts it even comes close to Tarantino/ Robert Rodriguez territory, yet as a whole it`s too muddled and uneven to suceed.

Jerry tries his hardest to make things right in the impossible situations that he has been forced into.  Sam can be shrill, but keep in mind that for the past five years her boyfriend has been in the mob and she has had to adjust her plans to deal with this.  I think that she has a right to be mad.  Many people didn't like this movie.  I don't think this is because the movie is bad.  I think that people didn't like the movie because it isn't what they expected.  The majority of people expected your standard romantic-comedy and had their hearts set on seeing one when they went to see the movie.  When the movie turned out to be this funky, offbeat, free spirited film, their expectations were not met and they were left unsatisfied.
I loved this movie.  I saw it on HBO. I have seen the movie at least 6 times.  I have read the script to the movie as well.  There are many things to watch for and a lot of things going on, but does that make the movie bad? No, it makes it complex and makes the viewer eager to understand.  However,dont take the movie to seriously, sit back and enjoy. Then compare the movie to every other movie thats been coming out lately and you'll notice that this is unique and shouldnt be judged in the way that normal movies are. In order to appreciate this movie, you need to throw out your expecatations and evaluate the movie for what it is.
Characters:  Jerry is an unlucky mob guy. He just wants to be normal and tries his hardest to be.  He is in love but has obstacles to face.  He an average guy that may seem dumb cuz he cant handle the unexpected, dangerous situation he has been forced into.  Sam is just frustrated that her boyfriend is in the mob.  Who wouldnt be?  You cant blame her for being somewhat shrill cuz she is acting exactly the way any other person would if their boyfriend was in the mob.  Leroy is average.

I suppose the director thought that by getting big names to be in his movie (Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts) that he could make this movie flop, a hit. This is not the case at all. He was horribly mistaken. The story goes absolutely nowhere and from the very first scene, there begins a steep downward spiral. So if you enjoy watching movies with no plot and horrible a script, by all means, view this movie. But if you like movies with plots and a somewhat presentable script, avoid The Mexican at all cost.

1323123,2,B00003CXRY,"On one summer night, while I was quickly flipping channels on my television to see if anything good was on, I saw that a movie called The Mexican was going to begin.  Although I had never seen the film, I knew about the stars and though I never really admired them, I decided to give it a chance.  By the end of the two longest hours it took me to watch the film (wait, Battlefield Earth was even longer) I was highly disappointed that I had even bothered to watch such a horrible and boring film that tried to catch my attention numerous times but failed every time.
Despite it having two superstars in the film industry, the Mexican is a film that is not worth seeing plainly because it is uninteresting and has nothing special in it.  More on the actual movie coming up later.  But for now: Plot.
Brad Pitt takes on the role of Jerry Welbach, a man working for some weird agency.  Jerry plans to have a honeymoon or something with his girlfriend Samantha Barzel (Julia Roberts) but an unexpected change of plans forces him to go to Mexico to retrieve a gun called the Mexican (hence the film's title).  Unfortunately for Jerry, someone steals the gun from him and it's up to him to get back.  Meanwhile, Samantha is kidnapped by gay hitman Winston Baldry (played by James Gandolfini from TV's The Sopranos), who plans to get back at Jerry for some reason.  Jerry now has a whole lot to accomplish:  Getting the gun back, saving his girlfriend, and winning her heart back.  The rest of the movie shows the journey that Jerry embarks on and though the plot sounds interesting, the actual movie isn't.
I don't really know if this movie is to be considered a comedy for there was complete silence while I watched it and my mouth never opened.  Okay, maybe for a cough but never for a laugh.  I don't know what the screenwriter was thinking when he wrote the screenplay but I feel that he was ashamed when he saw how terrible the movie is.  Not one joke, not one laugh.  Main Point:  This is not a comedy.  The film is probably a mix of romance (85% percent of the film) and thriller (15% percent) because it has a couple shootouts which might satisfy action fans.  Otherwise, I don't really know who to recommend this film to.
The performances are good though Gandolfini steals the movie away with his brilliant portrayal of Winston Baldry.  He probably was cast because of his role on the Sopranos (or the other way around) but I don't think they should have made him gay because that doesn't make any impact on the film.  Julia Roberts gives her typical performance, where she always gets the good man in the end and lives happily ever after with him.  Though there's a sign through the film that she's falling for Gandolfini's character, it's a bit predictable of who she'll end up with.  Brad Pitt delivers an average performance as the person trying to win the girl of his dreams.  Again, it makes the film more predictable and the ending is spoiled from the very beginning.
The biggest problem with the film is the longness.  The film is completely boring because instead of relying on plot twists to surprise the viewer, the script just enlarges one idea and adds more time to the film.  I feel that instead of the 123 minutes that took the film to explain every little thing, the screenwriter could have stuck to the little things and made it a plain 100 minute film.
Overall, the Mexican is definetely a must-not buy.  However, if it's ever on TV, you should probably check it out.  Beware, though, boredness is coming from the very first minute.",1043625600,3,3554,4.5140625
1323124,2,B00003CXRY,"This movie is a mess. The convoluted plot could probably work in good hands, but the direction is completely lacking in focus, and the editing is atrocious. Pitt and Gandolfini turn in good performances -- the only redeeming qualities to be found here. There are too many plot points that don't make any sense at all. One fairly prominent character disappears without a trace about halfway through the movie, and there is no explanation as to what happened to him -- or how a particular plot thread was resolved. You do figure that out after watching the deleted scenes on the DVD -- but why were these two or three key scenes deleted?

1323125,2,B00003CXRY,"A frequent argument that homosexuals have no choice about their sexual orientation takes the form of ""who could possibly choose to have traits so widely treated with prejudice, discrimination and hatred?"". As somebody of some kind of a libertarian perspective (""civil libertarian"" or otherwise; hard to know whether to use the word ""civil"" when it tends to delineate two factions in two opposite ""ideological"" directions, of which I am neither!), I've always maintained that arguments in favor of gay rights by way a ""no choice"" criterion are unnecessary; I would support gay rights whether anybody ever had any choice about their sexual orientation or not. Yet I do have good reason to question the argument of ""why would anyone ever choose something widely regarded and treated so negatively?"". In fact, if this movie has any bearing on reality at all, it gives a good reason for thinking someone might try to choose to be gay. One might wonder for a while if this movie treats its gay character sensitively, since it makes him a kidnapper of all things. But how the movie's leading female character, played by Julia Roberts, behaves is the thing really telling of the movie's motives. She gets kidnapped, and while in captivity coaxes her kidnapper ""out of the closet"" as gay. In the process she develops a rappor with him that is extremely surprising even in light of all explanations about how captives tend to ""identify with"" their captors. In the process she even seems comfortable in a degree of intimacy with him seldom if ever seen in mainstream cinema between two heterosexuals of the opposite sex. Meanwhile how does this same character treat her boyfriend? To him she is an excessively insufferable nag even by movie cliche standards. I think I must speak for not a few heterosexual males when I say that her treatment of her boyfriend is the stuff of our nightmares, while the sensitivity and intimacy with which she opens up to her kidnapper (none less) is ""to die for"". But alas, the latter is open only to gay men if the politically correct implications of today's movies have any inherent validity and/or power of persuasion (and they undoubtably do have some of the latter at least). So unless every element of this movie is utterly impertinent fantasy, it could in fact make a compelling argument why some heterosexual males might in their desperation try to choose to be gay. Hopefully reality is at least less extreme than this movie. But certainly it could still cause many a ""straight"" man to find things about the status of gays to envy, and not just confirm reasons why gay people could envy the social status of ""straight"" people.",1036368000,14,2657,4.854625550660793

We even thought ourselves brave last time when we actually went a few miles into Tijuana to take a closer look at the country.
Pity then, poor Brad Pitt, who not only has to enter the country, but rent a car and go into the middle of nowhere (at least to we gringos), to pick up an old pistol (named ""The Mexican) that his underworld bosses want.  He goes far beyond anything that could be called a tourist destination, and has to enter several hostile environments to achieve his mission.  The fact that it doesn't go smoothly provides the basic premise of the story.
I say basic premise, but not the complete story.  As a review is meant to be some sort of consumer advice, the big one here is that Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt are rarely on the screen together, and when they are, they are usually arguing.  Most of the ads for this film have directed you to think this, and it's not the case.
But that doesn't make it a bad movie.  First, we get to see a lot of Mexico that most citizens of this country don't get to see.  Yes, there is a lot of poverty, and yes, a lot of it is dirty (by our standards), but people still live there and make it their home.  It is alternately funny, scary, and revealing to see how Pitt navigates through the country trying to solve his problems.
But the big reason to see the movie is the interraction between Julia Roberts and her main kidnapper (more on this later), James Gandolfini.  What is first an obviously hostile situation turns into a strong bond that develops as the characters get to know each other.  Not a romantic bond in any way, but what turns out to be a genuine friendship that becomes potentially tragic when they both realize what has to happen to her if everything doesn't work out right.  For this, the movie is worth seeing.
So why only three stars?  Well, I take a little off because I hate when movies market themselves as something they are not, and I've already mentioned the lack of Pitt-Roberts screen time.  Also, we have not one, but two kidnappers, and what their individual roles are is not always made clear.  While flashbacks to the origin of the gun are very interesting, they are also confusing/conflicting, and I wasn't exactly satisfied that the final resting place for the gun was that big of a deal for everything that people went through to get it.
But there is enough in a lot of ways to make it definately worth a look.",1020038400,,2610,4.410416666666666
1323229,4,B00003CXRY,"I really thought that The Mexican was a great movie.  It got all sorts of bad raps, mainly because it isn't just a thriller, just a  romance, or just a comedy.  It is all these things rolled into one, which i love.  Also, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts in the same movie...whats not to like.  Brad does an awesome job.  He plays a mob lackey who is forced to go down to Mexico to retreive a priceless pistol dubbed The Mexican and bring it back to his boss.  In mexico, he gets into all sorts of trouble...poor Brad. His character's girlfriend, Julia is none too happy about this.  He promised to go with her to Vegas where she wants to fulfill her dream.  Angry and miffed, she goes to Vegas on her own.  But, in an effort to ensure that the pistol is brough back, Julia is kidnapped by a friendly man whom she becomed pals with.
This is really a great great movie.  Brad is just adorable, his responces to the problems he faces never fail to bring a smile to my face.  Julia, of course is phenominal.  You love her right from the begining and she gives a great performance.
So, my advice to you is to buy this movie!! Its absolutly great! And hey...if you DONT like the movie, droool over brad Pitt instead of watching.",1019692800,,1218,4.2663755458515285

I was not really enthused, as I had just seen Americas Sweetheart and laughed my head off at the dry wit of Billy Crystal. I was not ready for what I thought to be a drama with Julia Roberts. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the Mexican completely. Being a native to California and having lived several years in Southern Cali, I could completely relate to the analytical dialog between characters at what would seem to be inappropriate times. The `Supranos' star was true to his deep yet...sorry but I gotta kill ya now, persona was great. I actually could get into Brad Pitts, screw up' character role which fit him well.

Everyone was expecting typical Big Hollywood over-the-topness, which this movie does not have. Instead it is sublime. (Note: pay attention to the ""slow"" periods of the movie, they are actually important.) The way the story of the gun and it's maker is re-told, each time revealing a little more, giving you the clues you need to tie it into the current story, up to the beautiful climactic scene is nothing short of brilliant. Think of this as an Indie movie which just happens to have two big Hollywood stars. Think of it as the movie 'El Mariachi' WANTED to be.

The guys ex-girlfriend is kidnapped by a gay homosexual who is called Leroy. My favorite parts in the movie are the one were:
 The bar was noisy. Leroy looked at the woman accross from him, then to a guy at the counter. For a breif second, a dreamy look crosses his face. As soon as it appered, it dissapeared.
 The woman looked at Leroy, ""What was that?"" She asked.
 ""What was what?""
 ""That moment you had,"" The woman searched Leroys eyes for a trace of a lie.
 ""Oh, I wouldn't have called it a moment,"" Leroy said.
 The woman leaned over the table. She looked Leroy in the eyes and asked, ""Are you gay ...I liked the part where:
 The woman screamed into the phone to her boyfriend, ""You pick up the phone and say 'hello' as if your answering for room service? Ive been woried sick about you and all you can say is 'hello?'

1323233,4,B00003CXRY,"'The Mexican' has a good mix of comedy, romance, action, adventure, drama and suspense.  Very enjoyable movie.  Julia plays a wonderful quirky, smartypants, sensitive, woman in love.  Brad does very well as a slightly lost, good hearted semi-boyfriend just trying to keep himself alive while hoping that his semi-girlfriend will somehow understand.  James puts in a stellar performance as the guy who is ""very sensitive for a cold-blooded killer"".
I recommend giving this movie a shot.  Leave your expectations at the door and just enjoy the show for what it is ... a quirky kinda dark romantic comedy.  It is well done, combining romance, action and emotional impact with comedy.
There are some very funny scenes, a few somewhat deep scenes that deal with relationship issues and some dramatic scenes that are sad and some that are happy, all of them touching. There are also some subtle jokes, so keep your eyes and ears open!
Admittedly, there was a point where I felt that the movie was going on a bit long, but it quickly became interesting again and I forgot about that.
When you watch this movie, I recommend taking special note of the three main character's eyes.  The actors very effectively express their character's emotions and thoughts with their eyes.

1323234,4,B00003CXRY,"Many movie goers (and not a few critics) were perplexed by The Mexican. People don't like to be perplexed, and much of the word of mouth, as well as the reviews, were far from kind. I happened to really like this movie in many ways, but I tend not to categorize either movies or actors as much as others do. I think the best way to enjoy the movie is to forget that it brings the first pairing of super paid superstars Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. Try, if you can, to think of it as an independent film that just happens to star them. This might be difficult because, even though their bodies of work suggest otherwise, both Pitt and Roberts have reputations which make people want to see them in big budget formula flicks. So, forget the thoughts of a bubbly romance, ala Notting Hill. Here, not only are they acting in a rather dark little comedy, they are on screen together only four or five times. These scenes are memorable, however, and, considering how combative the characters are to each other, their being together through the whole movie would have proven to be too much.
Jerry and Samantha [Pitt and Roberts] have lived together for five years. They love each other, but they have issues which cause them to fight a lot. Samantha is into trendy psychobabble about relationships which drives Jerry crazy. Jerry was the party at fault in a traffic accident a few years back that caused a big mobster to be sent to prison. He's has been forced to work for the man's gang ever since. Jerry and Sam are planning to move to Las Vegas where Sam thinks she will find happiness by first becoming a waitress and then a dealer at a casino. When the mob unexpectedly forces Jerry to take one more job because he screwed up the last one, Sam revolts and throws him out. He must go to Mexico to retrieve a priceless antique pistol which is 'The Mexican' of the movie's title. Jerry never has had much luck or common sense, and everything imaginable goes wrong south of the border. Meanwhile, Sam leaves for Vegas alone. En route, she is kidnapped by Leroy [James Gandolfini], who claims he is holding her hostage to ensure Jerry's bringing the pistol back. Sam is no ordinary victim, as it turns out, and Leroy is about the most interesting kidnapper you'll ever meet. Back in Mexico, Jerry fumbles along and soon comes to believe the stories about the pistol's being cursed are the truth.
Gandolfini, who is best known for his role on HBO's The Sopranos, nearly steals the show as Leroy. He plays his role so well that you could say the movie has three stars. Pitt and Roberts are great, making the best of roles that are a bit difficult because these characters are sometimes hard to relate to. Sam can be awfully pushy and shrill, and Jerry is not working with a full deck. Actors of lesser skills would have lost any empathy with the audience, but Pitt and Roberts pull it off.
I have just one complaint about The Mexican. It's a comedy with a mean streak in it. Certain scenes that I assume are meant to be humorous seem a little cold blooded to me. I have seen this same technique in several movies recently. It's okay with me if a movie is callous, but such an attitude doesn't always equal funny. Still, there are enough laughs and witty lines to make it worth you while.",1016064000,,3278,4.474123539232053

I expected something mediocre (because of reviews) and found something suspenseful, funny, romantic and action packed. James Gandolfini as the gay hit man discovering his sensitive side was tremendous. He is much more comically effective than Robert DeNiro discovering his sensitive side in Analyze This. Some of the movie's characters twist and turn in who are the antagonists and the protagonists. Brad Pitt stars as a two-bit organized crime gopher that keeps screwing up. Great scene: Pitt on the side of a deserted highway, jumping and saying, ""This time I win. This time I win. This time I win...""

Jerry Welbach(Brad Pitt) is sent to sunny M&eacute;xico to the small ( and we're talkin' tiny) town of San Miguel to pick up a special gun. But his girl(Julia Roberts) wants him to stay and head off to Las Vegas (pronounced ""lost wages"") with her. As an alternative to being rolled up in a carpet, doused with gasoline and set on fire Jerry elects to head south of the border and pick up the Mexican. But he's after a gun not a person although the gun is said to hold a girl's soul within it. Once Jerry sets off Murphy's law rules as he gets lost, ripped off in the seediest bar in all M&eacute;xico and then learns his girl has been kidnapped to insure his co-operation. And THEN he also learns, near the end that he's been double crossed, the gun is going to a buyer not to mob boss Margolese, as he was told. But in the end the power of the gun settles all, Jerry and his girl get togther, the gun goes where it belongs and the cheater gets cheated.

I think the script was well written..the dialogues were fun and well developed, making sense as you follow along.
The settings for this movie coudn't be more accurate and precise for it truly represents an ambience of what ""The Mexican"" is.
It's just a simple movie but it has a certain charm that atracted me , because all the elements blend in together and gives you the final result: Fun,romance,excitement and action!
Let's not forget the soundtrack which is well balanced within each scene and really does the work in creating an enviroment and even brings up emotions within each part. It's easy to identify with the characters and the way they interact with each other.

1323316,3,B00003CXRY,"This movie seems like a rush job that had to accommodate the schedule of its central participants.  One gets the impression that there was little time allotted for revisions and numerous takes.  I kept getting the impression, perhaps unfairly, that the actors were more concerned with their next project.  The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts did not remind one of Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.  Also, they are getting too old to play the parts of individuals who act as if they are still in their late twenties.
Jerry (Pitt) is a bumbling petty criminal who cannot stay out of trouble. His boss portrayed by the always delightful Bob Balaban orders Jerry to enter Mexico to retrieve a pistol named ""The Mexican.""  This is no ordinary gun, and it might even be cursed.  The story line depends on a unflattering depiction of Mexican life that borders on caricature.  Every clich and demeaning stereotype is employed to push the story along. Samantha (Roberts) comes unglued by Jerry's new job assignment.  This results in a series of marginally comical events involving a gay professional assassin named Leroy (James Gandolfini).  The two of them engage in unrelenting psychobabble and overdone bathroom humor.  However,  I must concede that these scenes somewhat save the movie.  ""The Mexican""  is too long by about twenty minutes.  Gene Hackman has a cameo role at the very end portraying a criminal leader.  He adds virtually nothing to the plot, and Hackman reads his lines as if he only had one day of preparation.  Added star power is not sufficient to address a lackluster production.  Unfortunately, the powers that be in Hollywood have yet to learn this lesson.  This is not the worst movie ever made, and for fans of Pitt and Roberts there is just enough here to make it worth your while.  I'll give it three stars.",1012608000,,1844,4.871382636655949
1323317,1,B00003CXRY,"Two good stars in this film who tried their best but clearly a film ruined by a combination of director, studio, and editor.  The film should be edited down to 85 to 90 minutes instead of the 120 min running time. This film was poor beyond belief. There must have been 5 plot lines that were going at one time and then eventually 4 were killed (literally and figuratively), too bad the surviving plot line was so boneheaded and unbelievable, any one of the other plots could have made it a good film. The storyline was never made plausible or even remotely believable. It appeared that neither the script writers or the director had a clue where the film should be going and how to get there. I would not call it a comedy (black or otherwise, if so it wasn't terribly funny), not much of an adventure flick (rather manufactured), drama (perhaps, but to what point). If the Pitt character was that incompetent, the mafia boss would have terminated him early on, they really don't permit that many mistakes (usually your first is the last). The final explanation why the boss selected him struck me as somewhat lame--as if the director needed to explain a rather needlessly complex plot.  All around, an abysmal failure, too bad that they wasted the time of two very good actors.",1011052800,3,1277,4.621145374449339
1323318,3,B00003CXRY,"Those hoping to see Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts performing together in the same movie may well have to wait for the pairs next joint effort - for The Mexican is definitely NOT that film.  Indeed, it is safe to say that the two stars share less than  of the films total running time occupying even the same country let alone the same scene.  Still, despite that limitation, The Mexican turns out to be a rather fun, rather screwy comedy crime caper, offering an offbeat plot, stylish direction and first-rate performances by a talented cast.
The plot involves Pitt, as a young man named Jerry, who is sent on assignment to Mexico by a crime boss who wants him to retrieve a special Mexican pistol named, appropriately, The Mexican.  Meanwhile, Roberts plays his long time girlfriend, Samantha, who has just about had it with Jerrys inability to commit to their relationship and who decides she is going to move to Vegas to start life anew as a waitress or a croupier.  While in Mexico, Jerry runs up against some serious setbacks, while in Vegas, Samantha is kidnapped by Leroy, who holds Samantha as a bargaining chip to ensure that Jerry doesnt engage in any funny business on his way to completing his mission.
Ever since Pulp Fiction in 1994, we have been subjected to one film after another in which criminals and hit men talk about the mundane matters of civilized living in between shoot-outs and gangland-style executions.  This is now the standard for any crime film that wants to be considered hip, cool and contemporary.  Sometimes this technique works and sometimes it doesnt.  In the case of The Mexican, it mostly works.  This is due in no small measure to the playful screenplay by J.H. Wyman, who has managed to devise both humorous situations and high-spirited dialogue exchanges for his characters, a flashy directorial style by Gore Verbinski, who knows how to maintain an effective balance between humor and violence, and, above all, by delightful performances not only from Pitt and Roberts but from James Gandolfini, who literally steals the show as Roberts gay kidnapper, a confidante who keeps offering words of wisdom to a brokenhearted Roberts on matters of interpersonal relationships. Gandolfino creates a character of amazing depth, variety and subtlety, managing to seem threatening, decent, ruthless and caring, all while remaining within a very tight range of expression.  It is one of the most effectively understated, yet rich, performances I have seen in a movie in a very long time.
In The Mexican, Pitt once again demonstrates his undervalued skill as an actor.  The slightly quizzical, slightly befuddled expression he conveys throughout the film not only heightens the comedic elements of the screenplay, but creates a great deal of audience sympathy for this likable, well-meaning young man who just happens to be way in over his head with the rank company he is forced to deal with.  Roberts, likewise, does a stellar job as a woman who is alternately compassionate, frustrated, headstrong, feisty and committed.
Yes, one hopes that, in their next venture together, Pitt and Roberts will choose a vehicle with a little more substance than The Mexican seems to have  and that they get to spend a little more on-screen time together as well.  In the meantime, however, The Mexican does provide a number of ancillary pleasures to make it well worth checking out.",1010880000,3,3399,4.95079086115993

They unofficially break up and go their separate ways. When Pitt disappears in Mexico and the grandson ends up dead, the mob send the ruthless Leroy to get Samantha and hold her hostage.
Pro: Brad Pitt. Shows effortless charm in a role that he plays with natural ease. Much more at home playing Jerry, than in more serious roles in movies like ""Seven Years in Tibet"", ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""Devil's Own"".
Pro: James Gandolfini, Gives his character of Leroy 3 dimensions. Can be sweetly sensitive in one sentence and then ruthlessly coldfaced in the next. Lesser actors would have had Leroy turn into a pile of sentimental mush by the second act.
Pro: Julia Roberts. She plays Samantha with a great deal of understanding and kindness in her scenes with James Gandolfini and they have a great deal of chemistry together.
Pro: Edgy plotline. This movie is not your typical ""chick-flick"". It has violence, profanity (and a cool legend) that most action lovers would like.
Con: Julia Roberts. She is annoying and has little chemistry with Brad Pitt when they are together. She also continues to cross the line of sweet/saccherine in this movie. You don't have to give your devilishly beautiful smile to win us over Julia.
Con: While jokes are funny at first, it becomes lame and repetitive. Several jokes in regards to 1. A Dog 2. Traffic Light and 3. Mexican Rentals are shown to us over and over again.

1323505,5,B00003CXRY,"... ok, just kidding, but come on, this movie is getting a really bum rap in these amazon reviews.  I'm typically pretty picky when it comes to movies, but I really liked this one.  It's a pure escapist movie but who doesn't like that once in a while?
Brad and Julia have pretty good chemistry together and are quite funny as a bickering couple.  Brad Pitt plays somewhat against type as a total (but good-natured) dope.  He is a good comic actor and pulls off the physical comedy of the role well, and you gotta admit, he looks fabulous.  James Gandolfini (also playing somewhat against type) is believable as the tortured hit man.  And Julia is... well Julia... she laughs, she cries, her hair looks great and she's pretty funny, especially in her scenes with Pitt.
I can appreciate a movie that knows what it is as The Mexican surely does.  It's a fun, road/buddy/crime caper/romantic comedy movie that manages to keep it all pretty light.  It takes a stab at depth with a lot of talk about relationships but doesn't push too hard, which is a good thing!
Anyway, I felt I needed to counter all the negative reviews this is getting in here.  If you haven't seen it I recommend you give it a shot.",1004832000,9,1198,4.483870967741935
1323506,4,B00003CXRY,"You may be disappointed to know that Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts don't share a lot of screen time in ""The Mexican,"" part romantic comedy, part man hunt comedy thriller. Having said that, what there is of the two is plenty of fun, and for the most part, so is the rest of the film. It tends to be slow in the beginning, but it ends with a lot of heart and charm, and quickly becomes an above average movie.
Pitt stars as Jerry, who is called upon by his mob boss to complete one last mission that involves retrieving a gun from Mexico and bringing it back to the states. This means disappointment for his girlfriend, Samantha, played by Roberts, who dumps him and heads for Las Vegas once he is on his way to Mexico. Once he finds the gun, he soon learns its precious history and value, and soon becomes the target of various hit men and greedy bosses.
This beginning isn't all that interesting, and may discourage some from paying attention to the film's later moments. There are light moments of comedy, including a perfectly funny argument between Jerry and Samantha, but once he is on his way to Mexico, things begin to get sluggish.
However, once Samantha becomes a hostage held by hit man Leroy (James Gandolfini of HBO's ""The Sopranos""), things begin to get interesting, and funnier than before. Sam and Leroy develop a bond that is completely offbeat, considering their relationship as kidnapper and hostage, yet his quiet homosexuality provides some light touches of comedic brilliance that are sure to induce laughter.
Things in Mexico begin to get interesting as well, once Jerry begins putting the pieces together about who is actually on his side, and who's out to get him. This provides for a few good action scenes, and a few controversial scenes as well. One scene in particular involves Jerry's discovery about Leroy's real agenda, a reversal twist that comes as more of a disappointment than a welcomed surprise, considering how much we have come to like and care for his character.
One very smart thing about ""The Mexican"" is its ability to play by the rules, giving us a mystery plot that is not too complex, and ties all of its loose ends together when the ending draws near. You won't have to think to hard about what's going on, as most of the characters are given exposition dialogue to explain such things as the history of the gun, and some of the twists involving hit men and mob bosses. Those seeking a highly energized mystery thriller may find this story a bit too juvenile, while those looking for something that won't insult their intelligence will be delighted.
Kudos and more just praise goes to the cast, all of whom give some of the greatest performances in a comedy this year. Pitt proves his ability to do comedy as Jerry, and his action sequences are top of the line. Roberts is back in fine form, her best performance since ""Erin Brockovich;"" if she can't carry off the phrase ""I can't find my Kotex cards or my credit pads,"" then no other actress can. She shares a nice chemistry with Pitt, as well as with Gandolfini, who gives one of the greatest performances of the year as Leroy. Gandolfini's acting is the film's best, which is why that aforementioned reversal twist comes as such a shock to the audience.
For the most part, ""The Mexican"" delivers in some places, and really hits the mark in others. It's plot may seem second rate for those looking forward to the first big film starring both Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt, but it packs a nice punch of comedy, heart, and even some action as well. It's cast is superb, and the characters are real, and the end result is great fun; I loved it!",1004572800,2,3635,4.585253456221198
1323507,1,B00003CXRY,James Gandolfini is the highlight of this movie -- but sad to say he can't carry it alone.  Pitt has always struck me as a wooden actor and he seems to infect Roberts to become similarly shallow in quality.  Poor movie -- don't bother.,1004140800,,235,4.318181818181818
1323508,3,B00003CXRY,"Very odd but often entertaining comedy that features humorous performances from its stars, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. A disappointing factor for those hoping to watch these two lovelies together is the fact that they hardly share any screen time together. After a very shaky start of watching this odd couple fight over a trip to Las Vegas (which are terribly acted, revealing either too little rehearsing or actors not actually performing scenes on the set together), the film gets going when Pitt is forced by a group of gangsters to whom he owes a favour to retrieve a supposedly cursed handcrafted gun from Mexico. While he is gone Roberts is kidnapped by a hitman (James Gandolfini) who is possibly one of her boyfriend's enemies. Most of the film is funny, but some twists and turns will feel so odd as to not actually be quirky but actually be very uncomfortable. Considering the mean tone the film has, it seems like a real let-down when the ending turns out to be much sappier then expected, and director Gore Verbinski can't seem to decide if he wants to actually make a grungy movie or show his actors up as gorgeous icons.

It's good to see Pitt and Roberts try a hand at romantic comedy. The plot about the gun is infinitely fascinating to someone like me who used to live near the Texas-Mexico border, and the movie brought back fond memories of Mexico. More romantic than ""Traffic,"" more comical than the guy who took me on a date to Mexico. I used to know a guy who looked like Pitt, so, I can't own this movie. It would give me the willies.

1323510,4,B00003CXRY,"This is one of the few films which do not give away much of its contents through its trailers.  When I saw the trailer first, I immediately scrapped ""The Mexican"" in my 'to watch' list of movies.  My husband brought the DVD home one day & I sat grudgingly with him to watch & surprisingly, I found it funny.  Well...black humor, if you may call it...coz despite seeing the characters being shot at, killed or punched, the scenes came out funny isntead of horrible.
I would agree to what most of the viewers said that ... Leroy gave a very interesting twist & perk to the story.  True, he & Sam had a better chemistry going rather than Sam & Jerry.  On the other hand, I believe Jerry & the drooling dog even made a better pair than him & Sam.  Well, I guess the Director & the scriptwriter did not want to focus on the romance aspect so that portion really came out flat.  & maybe, that's why a lot of viewers found that aspect quite bland because they expected an exciting romantic adventure for these 2 main characters.
Overall, I would give it a 4.  I found the entire set-up & script funny.  The twists were weird but interesting to some degree.  (Forget the romance angle - don't even consider it when rating this film.)  & yes, the trailer [was terrible] but that made my expectations low & therefore resulted to a higher rating.",1001203200,2,1335,4.3861788617886175

Brad Pitt had the temerity to run into a big-time crook with his car and ever since then has worked off his debt by doing the bad guy's dirty deeds. (How unlikely is that?) His last assignment is to recover the gun and bring it back to his boss.  Julia Roberts is kidnapped by another bad guy with a heart of gold and they form a real bond as the movie progresses.  It's hard to tell who's a bad guy and who's a good guy and frankly, by the end of the movie, I didn't care!",1001116800,,745,4.082191780821918
1323512,4,B00003CXRY,"A film that was a pleasant little surprise especially considering how easily the people who made it could have turned it into a glossy, star-powered film. Instead, they have made a quaint, interesting and entertaining film where the supporting characters can be more interesting than the super-star mains.
 It has been said before but the most interesting part of this movie is how the director has managed to get two of the biggest names in Hollywood, have them apart for three quarters of the movie and have it all work out for the better. This was an excellent choice to make. With this happening the film is no longer supremely star driven and it can focus more on its plot and other characters instead of Robert's and Pitt's pretty faces. It was a risk and I think the film may have suffered financially because of it (this was not a huge film for either stars) but critically the film has been praised.
 Both Pitt and Roberts are excellent together and apart. Pitt is enjoyable to watch as his character squirms through all of the mishaps that occur. Roberts is delightful, as usual, and it was nice to see her in a more down-to-earth role. Both stars, however, are completely blown off of the screen by James Gandolfini's fantastic portrayal as a hitman sent to keep tabs on Roberts' character. The scenes with him are the best in the film and all of his verbal exchanges with Robert's are great. The two of them seem to work off of one another and they raise simple scenes to a higher level with genuine non-sexual, on-screen chemistry.
 The directing is not flashy and that fits the story and the feel of the film very well. The decision to keep the stars apart was a brilliant move and it is what made the film great. The director appeared to know exactly what part of the story to focus on at each moment and this made a potentially confusing film easy to follow. He has a strong sense of story and an obvious talent.
A wonderful, fairly light film that is a hidden gem amongst many of the star-powered films out there. This film reminds us why these two are stars in the first place: they are great actors. The film is funny and exciting, at times romantic and highly recommended. Give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised too.

1323513,2,B00003CXRY,"Movie Summary: Jerry Welbach is pretty much a loser with bad luck. He is trying to get his life together before his girlfriend Samantha makes good on her threat and leaves him. It's no surprise to her or us that Jerry fails again and Samantha is on her way to Las Vegas without even listening to Jerry's latest excuse. Had she listened she'd have heard a long drawn out confusing story about Jerry having to drive to Mexico to retrieve an antique pistol for a mob boss whom he is in debt to. Why they send Jerry is beyond everyone, but they do. Soon Jerry realizes that he is in over his head and Samantha turns up missing. Is there any way Jerry can get lucky enough to pull this job off?
My Opinion: This movie is a case of all the pieces just not coming together. Mostly the story just never becomes engaging. I was stuck in a ""yeah who cares"" mood for most of the movie. Roberts and Pitt weren't bad, they just never had any chemistry with each other or the plot. The best relationship was between Pitt and the dog that came with the El Camino. James Gandolfini has a great part and may just be the best part of the movie. The plot tries to generate excitement with twists and turns, but none of them seem to work. I remember thinking that this was just a poor man's ""Snatch"" a movie which I thoroughly enjoyed by the way. When everything was said and done, I wasn't able to care about any of the couples in the film nor any of the characters (except the dog).  I had a lot of trouble with the fact that they sent a screw up like Jerry to retrieve the pistol when it seemed that they really wanted the pistol. Had they been expecting him to fail it would have been more believable. I was able to make it to the end of the movie and even watched the deleted scenes, but I was looking forward to the next movie while I was watching it. As far as entertainment value goes, this one ranks low.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1  Sound: DD 5.1  Extras: Trailers, Making Of, Deleted Scenes, Production Notes. This is a nice full DVD release.
What You Should Do:  Skip it unless you are really into Brad Pitt or Julia Roberts. Warning: This is not a normal Julia Roberts film. She is not the main character. This is not a romantic comedy.

What I ended up seeing was a very funny, very entertaining romance/violent road moveie. Brad Pitt is delightful as the bumbling, reluctant hero who just wnats to make his girlfriend happy. Julia Roberts, said girlfriend, leaves him after he goes of on a search for a valuable gun the mexican. What follows is separate road trips that eventually bring them together. Roberts is quite charming and vaguely annoying. Classic Julia, in her type of role. However, the real star here is James Gandolfini (""The Sopranos"") as the sensitive hitman with a secet who kidnaps and then befriends Roberts. He's charming and adds a lot the the movie's humor. Overall, it's very violent and filled with bad language, and it deserves its R rating, but you'll laugh more than you'll cry.

It involves a higher power than he can comprehend, and he manages to get screwed over a few too many times. Julia Roberts is hilarious as his overreacting girlfriend. The hitman was a deep and interesting character. I was cheering for all three of them. I was drawn in by the fact that you never knew what was going to happen next, and you don't know if it's going to end happily or not.
The thing about this film is that it's a mix of several genres: action, drama, comedy, and romance. None of these elements are out of place, however. There are witty jewels of comedy placed randomly throughout the film. When important events occur, you feel something because you have been drawn into the characters. The action is mostly implied and not really gory.

1323598,4,B00003CXRY,"For those who anticipated the two mega stalwarts Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts to dazzle with a modern day romance, THE MEXICAN comes as an awkward surprise. That's not to say the oddball romance is without its merits - in fact the quirkiness and unpredictible goofy plot manages to enhance the characters, each with their own encounters and reunites for a twist in the plot towards the end.
Director Gore Verbinski (Mousehunt) is courageous in choosing this plot - and the co-stars has never been more compatible. Though Pitt and Roberts do not share much screen time together, it's a journey they seemed to enjoy. Pitts plays Jerry who is on his last ""delivery"" trip for the mafia - and little does he know about the pistol he is handling is much sought after. It leads to mayhem and even drags Sam (Roberts) to be kidnapped by Winston. There is humour along the way as each character apprehends their fate - Roberts gets to confirm her love for Jerry and befriends an affectionate Winston for a killer. It is unpredictibly exhilarating as each character faces tacky yet hilarious situations - and the ending glosses the uneven setting and plot with Gene Hackman making a cameo appearance.
THE MEXICAN may not be your typical romance, yet the fun that Roberts and Pitts share is so infectious and bubbly that you shouldn't have any misgivings. The middle part of the movie sags a little but the ultimate piece of work is gratifyingly uplifting. It is though - a movie that you either like it or hate it to the core - ambivalence gives THE MEXICAN a 3.5 stars rating.",999302400,,1566,4.657039711191335

In the meantime, someone 'kidnaps' Sam (Julia Roberts), who is Jerry's than girlfriend, to tell him where the gun is and where Jerry is.

1323680,3,B00003CXRY,"It is possible that this film was produced just to see if putting Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts in the same film would automatically produce a blockbuster no matter how weak the script.  Well, now we have our answer.  This is a B movie screenplay that grossed close to $70 million, a stunning tribute to star power.
The story is a quirky tale about a loser named Jerry (Brad Pitt) and his neurotic girlfriend Samantha (Julia Robert) and his misadventure procuring a legendary Mexican pistol that is believed to be cursed.  While he is on this mission from the mob, his girlfriend is taken hostage by Leroy (James Gandolfini), a gay hit man who is holding her to assure that Jerry doesn't run off with the gun and sell it.  The characters aren't the only ones that need therapy, since the film has an identity crisis of its own.  Is it a light hearted comedy or a blood and guts action flick?  The answer is both, but neither is done well.
There are a few good skits in the film, mostly between Gandolfini and Roberts.  The slapstick is mostly lame due to the fact that Brad Pitt, gorgeous though he might be, is no comedian.
This is an opportunity for the three leads to spread their wings a bit, playing characters that take them to unaccustomed territory.  Gandolfini gives us his standard mob characterization, but this time with a twist.  Beneath that murderous exterior, he is ultra sensitive and gay, and he uses his hostage to vent all his loneliness and frustration.  Gandolfini continues to prove that he is one of the best mob toughs ever, gay or straight, with a droll performance that produces some of the best laughs in the film.  Yet, of the three, his performance strayed the least from his comfort zone.
Julia Roberts gets a chance to extend her already awesome comedic talents with this part.  She steals the show with her portrayal of the temperamental girlfriend from Hades, who is constantly spouting west coast psychobabble and blaming everyone else for her problems.  Her comedic screen chemistry with Gandolfini is fabulous as the two lob grenades at one another, throwing in subtle physical comedy without missing a beat.
Brad Pitt is completely out of his element in this film.  I admire his courage in taking a role so far removed from his normal type.  Pitt is used to playing the hardened rebel, always smart, resourceful and independent.  This role is the antithesis of that.  Here he plays a dim-witted, bumbling, henpecked loser and he is all thumbs trying to slip into his character's skin.
Overall, the film is far less than the sum of its parts.  This is likely to be a big disappointment for Pitt fans, but a pleasant surprise for Roberts and Gandolfini fans.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. For one thing, both Pitt and Roberts gave pretty solid performances. The romance aspect of the film is OK, and there was a minimum number of times where I was distracted by the acting.
Even better was that the action/mystery part of the film works  well, also. The storyline is enjoyable, with some interesting twists and good suspense.
One complaint about the DVD version: the sound is awful. It would get too loud, making you turn down the volume, then it would suddenly drop down to where you could hardly hear it.

Already by the first scene when Julia Roberts is lying in bed and Brad Pitt is sitting sceptical besides her , one thing is obvious : they don't look good together . It's actually hard to understand what's wrong with the couple . Even though they share only two or three scenes together they fail to convice as real lovers . If you analyze seperately each perfomance you can still find faults to mark . Julia's charms are as always hard to resist . She's simply the most loveable star in Hollywood at the moment . In this movie though , she displays an excessive hysteria and since the script wants her to hate her boyfriend ( only when he fails to keep his promises though ) she makes constant agressive declarations against Pitt's character , immediately one after another ...but her panic and anger just doesn't feel natural .Pitt on the other hand is definetely one of the most enigmatic actors of the last decade . He was sensational as the young , sensitive vampire in Interview With A Vampire ,schokingly human in Seven , cool and funny in Fight Club . On the other hand he was truly awfull as clumsy , german climber in Seven Years In Thibet , one-dimensional and boring as the horny reaper in Meet Joe Black. Here he gives one of his worst perfomances yet , one of these perfomances ex-fashion models give in order to start a movie career . He fails to be even as half as believable as J.Galdofini is in the film's central supporting role . The thing is there are many young actors who could play this part much better than Pitt like , for example Liev Schreiber or even Ben Chaplin . And it's really unfair that gifted guys like that never get the chance to play opposite Roberts and get known by a wider audience . Despite all that ,The Mexican is not as depthless as it's trailer implies .Sporadically it's touching and at times suprisingly serious .It's plot has one or two twists which merely work and the photography travels you to the lazy beautiness of Mexico.

1323791,2,B00003CXRY,"""The Mexican"" wants us to believe that since we've got Brad Pitt and Julia ""White Teeth"" Roberts in a movie, a coherent script is optional. Sadly, only the most passive of viewers will find this an acceptable mix; not only is this film incredibly overlong for the material, it ends up being boring and closes with an overwhelming sense of futility and will leave most questioning, ""So...what?""
 Pitt does his best spastic loser impression, bumbling around the movie and trying to fix things with his girlfriend, an often-hysterical Roberts. Wyman's script is a lot less fun than it seems to think it is; attempts to make this a condensed ""Way Of The Gun""-style gritty adventure as well as a comment on the dynamics of two people in impossible love fail horribly. In fact, since neither concept is properly developed, moments of startling violence look like a gimmick, and it's hard to believe for one frame of the movie that Pitt and Roberts' characters are/were ever/will ever be in love.
 The one bright spot of the movie is Gandolfini, whose complex (or at least moreso than any other character in this mess) hitman is brought to life by his trademark mix of warmth and alarming force.
 Unfortunately, he can't come close to saving the movie; ""The Mexican"" is a pointless and meandering movie so set in trying to be five or six other movies that it can't make its own name for itself.
 Interestingly, the deleted scenes on the DVD fill out some substantial plot holes, but otherwise don't explain how with two hours of screen time (and nearly 140 minutes with deleted scenes in the mix), a promising crew and two of the biggest stars in America today can accomplish nothing and have you caring much less than you did when you walked in.",997315200,14,1739,4.7105263157894735

1323859,1,B00003CXRY,"Widely promoted in posters, magazine and newspaper ad art and in theatrical trailers as a romantic, screwball road-movie, this film arrives on DVD in a great-looking widescreen transfer with extras.  Unfortunately, the promise of an extended on-screen coupling of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, two red-hot megawatt stars is quickly broken when the plot forces them to go their separate ways for most of the movie.
J.H. Wyman's original screenplay has bounced around town and it's easy to see why. It's a confusing mish-mash of basically unrelated material. There's a feeble fable of a cursed, antique Mexican pistol, there's a sweet, weepy, sensitive gay hit man wonderfully played by burly James Ganolfini, and there's Brad Pitt's laid-back turn as a mobster's errand boy making one last run. Julia Roberts is pretty much a shrill whining caricature in bright colors who bonds with her sensitive, yet cold-blooded kidnapper (Gondolfini) while complaining about boyfriend Pitt.
Even though things don't satisfactorily come together in this movie, it is visually pleasing.  Gore Verbinski (""Mouse Hunt"") directs with a verve but the forced material can't be overcome.  The commentary by the director and writer gets awfully pretentious and self-serving at times and the only thing that is made abundantly clear is that this movie was written by a person who has little life experience but has no doubt logged thousands of hours watching movies.

Julia Roberts's rather loony rendition of Pitt's pyscho-babble enamored girlfriend teeters just on the edge of irritating, but Roberts's natural charm keep her in the audiences' good graces.
The movie's real saving grace is James Gondolfini's delirously improbable character, who truly makes the movie worth seeing and adds the best entertainment value.

First off, I have to compliment the screenplay, for no other reason than it was penned by a third cousin Joel Weiner who is credited as 'J.H. Wyman'. I really did like the concept of parallel storytelling with the recounting of an old Mexican legend and the modern story, but it ultimately wasn't enough to hold it all together. Brad Pitt just doesn't do well with the main character who, like Griffin Dunne in After Hours, has a little black cloud over everything he does.

I was neither surprised nor completely disappointed. ""The Mexican"" is, indeed, very Hollywood. It is not the best movie of either star's career (I say ""Fight Club"" for Pitt and ""Erin Brockovich"" for Roberts). It is funny in parts, cute in others, and occasionally suspenseful.

What elevates ""The Mexican"" from the typical Hollywood muck is James Gandolfini. I have not been fortunate enough to see Gandolfini on ""The Sopranos"" as I don't have HBO, but his performance in ""The Mexican"" convinces me that he is one of our great actors. He puts everyone and everything else to shame. Perhaps that doesn't benefit the film; I read a review somewhere that mentioned Gandolfini as acting A-list in a B-movie.

Hardly. I enjoy long films when they are good, The Mexican was long, flat and boring at just over 2 hours. Studio notes were stuck all over The Mexican and you could see the committee behind every decision, surprisingly though the dialogue was left in long winded flat monologues which made for tedious viewing. People wanting to structure dialogue like Tarantino or Kevin Smith should be first talented. Attempted jokes were simple and had me coughing dust off them. The Mexican tried to be multi-layered but succeeded in making the stories involved way to distant and the director (who should go back to directing kids films) didn't have any idea how to better relate them. Oh and let me not forget what will be the new Hollywood cliche of the future, the unexpected gay character. I found the dog mildly amusing but I could see the feel good committee behind him also.

1323938,1,B00003CXRY,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILER
The usual way for an actor to steal a film is to over-act shamelessly. In 'The Mexican' however James Gandolfini walks away with the show simply by being the only actor not to showboat. Apparently Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt took big pay cuts to make 'The Mexican' because they liked the script so much. Sadly the script doesn't seem quite so keen on them. Both are cast against type (Not a good idea if, like these two, you don't have much range), and as a result spend two hours saying ""Look at us, we're playing against type."" Roberts (a performer who does most of her acting with her teeth) is Sam, a self-obsessed, shrewish hysteric. Brad Pitt is Jerry, her boyfriend, an incompetent moron, who runs odd jobs for the mob. This is played for laughs, just as well as he wouldn't last till lunchtime with real gangsters. Faced with playing these two caricatures Pitt and Roberts resort to wild mannerisms and shameless mugging in a futile attempt to hold our attention. Fortunately the tooth-some two spend little time on screen together, as they generate little heat between them.  As one final job he is sent south of the border to retrieve a legendary pistol, 'The Mexican' of the title. Needless to say he screws up. Why he has to undertake this mission at all is never explained, 'The Mexican' is being held by the mob-bosses grandson. Couldn't they just ask him to bring it home? Why send someone as incompetent as Jerry to undertake this important mission is also left unexplained. Sam, failing to appreciate that Jerry isn't just being selfish in choosing to go rather than get his head blown off, high-tails it to Las Vegas.  No sooner has she set off than she is kidnapped by 'Leroy' in order to ensure that Jerry remains compliant. Leroy, played by James Gandolfini (Julia Roberts was instrumental in getting him cast, and in this - if not her own performance - she does the film a great service), is the one recognizably human character.  Instead of the frantic arm waving of the purported stars what we get from Gandolfini is a subtle, nuanced performance. By turns funny, touching and brave, Gandolfini unfortunately highlights the absence of these qualities in the rest of the film. It is surely down to Gandolfini's skill that we care about Leroy at all, as the script doesn't give him much to do but trade therapy-speak with Sam. Leroy, as much as Sam and Jerry, is a walking, talking clich: He's gay so he must be sensitive; He contemplates giving up being a hit man as soon as he finds love; he is full of self-hatred; like any gay character in a mainstream film, he does not get a happy ending.  It is hard not to believe that Leroy is gay just to try and make the film seem more hip, but this is a misnomer, as his newfound love for Frank - unlike that between Sam and Jerry - is not held to be of any great importance. Yet it is this brief relationship that provides the only moments of true emotion, Gandolfini is heartbreaking in these scenes, as Leroy finds and then loses love. Never resorting to the sort of weep-fest that Oscar voters love so much, Leroy - realizing Frank's death - exacts his revenge and moves on, brokenhearted but stoic. It is this disparity between the two couples that underscores the shallowness of the whole enterprise.  Sam, for all her psychobabble, has no real idea of love beyond her own self-absorption. When Jerry kills Leroy she protests ""But he was my friend."" but has forgotten him by the next scene. We are expected to side with Jerry for killing Leroy, for it turns out that Jerry had already met the real Leroy and this wasn't him. This Leroy is really Winston (in an earlier scene when Sam sees the name tattooed on his arm 'Leroy' dismisses Winston as being someone he hates), and his intention was to steal 'The Mexican' for a rival gang. This sole fact is supposed to undercut the validity of 'Leroy/Winston' as a likable character. Why? He pretended to be someone else but his personality was true, and it was this, which made him the emotional core of the film.  That Leroy isn't Leroy is supposed to be a twist, but you can see it coming over the horizon. When Sam finds out Gandolfini's name is Leroy she is surprised, isn't Leroy a black name? Sure enough the real Leroy is black. In a blatant piece of foreshadowing Jerry (before meeting Leroy/Winston) mentions that he has met ""Leroy, from Michigan."" which makes Gandolfini's New Joisey accent rather a give-away.  The filmmakers think that we should side with Jerry rather than Leroy/Winston because he is prettier. His death has repercussions for the rest of the film, if they had to kill him off couldn't they have waited till nearer the end? With the only likable person out of the picture, the remaining half-hour drag's on through the tedium barrier. For a film purporting to be fast-paced the two-hour running time is deadly. A lot of screen time is given over to Jerry's 'comic' adventures, and it is these, which would have benefited from a more drastic edit. The flashbacks to the creation of the gun are also wearing, displaying Hollywood's picture-postcard idea of south of the border folklore. These and the modern day Mexican's depicted are strictly stereotyped either sneaky tooth-flashing villains or mustachioed upholder of honour.  The ending is cynically sentimental, the mob boss (a bored looking Gene Hackman) wanting the gun so that he can give it to the Mexican family whose ancestor we see in flashback, dying for the forbidden love of a man considered beneath her. If only Sam and Jerry had emulated these doomed lovers, but then self-absorbed as they are they would probably consider it to be ""avoiding commitment"".",988502400,7,5694,4.687

7918391,2,B00003CXRY,"Had this movie been half an hour shorter and eliminated the whole subplot with James Gandolfini and its associated grisly murders it might have been a fun caper. As it stands it seems to go on forever and delve needlessly into the serious nature of relationships, especially since Pitts character isn't serious. JK Simmons also wanders through as another unnecessary character. Pitt is fun to watch, Roberts is OK, but it doesnt work.",1517356800,,434,4.958904109589041

Totally enjoyable and entertaining with stellar Brad Pitt performance.

This is in my category of 'stories I realize are improbable, but am willing to go along and enjoy.

Delightfully shot and directed.

For Brad Pitt movie night, follow it with 'Burn After Reading.'",1513123200,,276,5.066666666666666

7918394,3,B00003CXRY,Except for the fact that when this movie came out it was so hyped up because it had Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts Both in it.  I have never really been a fan of either one of them.  Although I think Julia Roberts is alright when she is not the main star like in Valentines Day.  As far as the movie.  I think it is o.k as an action comedy romance movie.  But nothing really stands out about it.,1509494400,,392,3.911392405063291
