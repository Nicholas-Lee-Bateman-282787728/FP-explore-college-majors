Expensive prenatal classes. The DVD is really informative we just sat
In front of our big screen in our living room and watched 1 segment at
At a time ( about 9 segments). Shari is a midwife so mostly talks from a midwife's (all natural) point of view
But dose acknowledge the fact that all women will not birth all natural or give birth in a birthing center
In my opinion this DVD is really good and is a great alternative to child birthing classes she goes over
Everything nutrition,  breathing, exercises, breastfeeding, complications just to name a few.",1284768000,,622,4.553571428571429
