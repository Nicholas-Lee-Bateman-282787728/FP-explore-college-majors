However, it throws in a very biased ""Christian""  slant in the end.  I was disappointed in the ending.  Facts are important these days.  Religious bias is old paradigm and counterproductive for survival.  Respect to all religions and all beings everywhere!  We are our own shadow govt.  We need to correct ourselves and let go of our own angers, fears and bitterness.  Knowledge is power but action is life!  To anyone out there profiling us and suppressing their fellow humans,  shame on you.  Get a real job and get a life!  Profiling is creepy.

3946390,5,B002LFPBK6,"The first two thirds of this is very factual and straight forward; then it starts looking at the book of Revelations. As a Christian I think it is good to be aware of these things pointing to a possible end-times, but I cannot say for sure myself. The bible clearly states that  Jesus will return as a thief in the night, and no-one will know the hour or day. I don't want that to sound like a bad review of the film however - I thought the first part was well thought out and put together, and there are plenty of good points made in the movie itself and the extras - enough for Anyone to at least be concerned about, not just Christians. I don't think all this surveillance is necessary and it creates a level of power that can and will corrupt someone. Our government was founded on due process and I hate to see our society give up our privacies in the name of fighting terrorism. Do your own investigating and find out how many plots were stopped. And then sit and think about how this surveillance Could be abused, and ask yourself- What prevents it from being abused now?",1415577600,5,1078,4.310344827586207

Reaction to Shadow Government, which enumerates the on-going preparation to control the world, is often first shock, then nervousness, and finally fear at the reality sweeping over civilization.

View 'SG' first and then follow it up with Jeffrey's book, The Global Warming Deception* to get the overview with facts and then a close-up of just one of the approaches being implemented to take over the world.

Or, view TGWD first, and then follow up with a viewing of 'Shadow Government' to enhance the perspective of the mounting catastrophes approaching mankind.

Great comfort is then derived from the words of Jesus, ""Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.""  {Luke 21:36, KJV.}

3946425,5,B002LFPBK6,Shadow Government has revealed many unnerving transformations in government that are shocking to say the least. These changing policies in government need to be exposed so that the truth of what is coming is told. The Bible references at the end of the DVD tie in nicely the world events happening now that have been predicted in revelations and other scriptures. I would reccommend Shadow Government to anyone who is searching for wisdom and the truth.,1282003200,21,453,4.973684210526316

3946427,3,B002LFPBK6,"I'm telling you right off the bat that I'm more than fairly well read where conspiracy theories are concerned. I am however, always keeping an eye out for better or more detailed information. This video did provide some of that but not much more.

The Good Stuff: They used seemingly credible people talking about things within their field of expertise. Most of the people came off quite well. All appeared knowledgeable in their field and very even headed. They did not come across as being crackpots. The information was very detailed and was good fodder for further investigation.

The Bad stuff: As the end of the video neared, things started getting a bit more vague. They touched on the Council for Foreign Relations, the Bilderburg Group and United Nations, but didn't offer the same amount of detail as with the previous items. Maybe legalities were the issue, or maybe time, but there was really nothing new here. Then in the last few minutes they touch on how all these things were prophesied in the Bible, but all they really did was concentrate on the founding of Israel after WWII. This very short segment got vague to the point of being useless.

And the One World Government point wasn't made to my satisfaction. I know that there are a lot of theorists touting this and many have some good points, but certain things still do not add up in my book and this video did nothing to change my mind.

This is a decent enough watch. There is much to learn here, but if you're at all into this kind of thing do not expect any major revelation here. Just grab the good stuff and use it for further study.",1278547200,45,1611,4.56401384083045

3946452,3,B002LFPBK6,"Welcome to the new world order where every key stroke, ""Every breath you take/
And every move you make/...Every step you take/I'll be watching you"" (Sting)

The Shadow Government is all around if we could but perceive.  It's surveillance cameras, implanted microchips, the UN, the NWO and its one world government police state, sinister ""new age"" forces arrayed against Christians and Jews, a grab-bag of secret and not so secret powerful corporate and government forces determined to erase national borders, decimate economic systems, exterminate 5/6 of all human beings on planet Earth and reduce the remaining population to a state of imbecilic indentured servitude to the global elites. The disclosure of which is, apparently, meant ""to shine a light on God's incredible prophecies.  It's meant to bring you closer to our eternal savior, Jesus Christ.""  Some plan.

The real deception in this documentary is that for the first hour (more or less) we hear from university professors and bona bide researchers who delineate the current state of affairs insofar as even the most seemingly innocuous use of plastic cards records our transactions, our comings and goings and our affiliations. They offer astute analysis and speculate on the possible nefarious uses of the data collected every time our cards are swiped, our emails are sent and our internet searches are collected, etc.  All this is well and good.  But then we begin to hear from, shall we say, the outside the academy religious folks who write newsletters or head `foundations'.  And at that point the entire program goes off the tracks into the thicket of biblical end times prophecy.

The shift of focus is subtle at first, a few voices here and there railing against the UN or the persecution of Christians; but then an entirely new theme emerges: the Bible.  (Of course, I should have paid more attention to the DVD packaging as it is ""From the Producers of Left Behind: The Movie"". My bad.)  Suddenly, the professors and PhD's vanish to be replaced by someone named Chuck Missler who leads a parade of christian missionaries quoting the Bible and placing its alleged prophecies into the context developed by the scholars.  For instance, there is anti-UN, anti-environmentalist Michael Shaw who is absolutely freaked out because he believes that the UN Earth Charter is going to replace the 10 Commandments.  It's all part of a conspiracy by these blasted Nature worshiping one-worlder environmentalists.  But Shaw sees through it all.  ""The environment is the cover for the real objective of sustainable development which is to change our system of Justice and change our systems of economics to a system of social justice....Our whole foundation of the American experiment is being undermined by this environmental move.""  Then a guy named Jack Kinsella chimes in with ""anthropomorphic global warming....Now this is ridiculous to begin with.""  No, Jack, you are ridiculous. Of course, now we know where Glenn Beck gets his ideas.  Heaven forbid there should be any sensitivity to the planet's eco/biosystems, or a commitment to social justice as the Catholic Church has been advocating for decades.  Not for US this seemingly communistic idea of social justice and the hoax of climate change.

Of course, to be fair, Kinsella does say that if there is such a thing as global warming, it's the Sun's fault.  See, the sun is getting hotter and therefore Earth and Mars are warming.  And since there is nothing that can be done about it, the best course of action is to do nothing and wait for Jesus to return to rapture up the saved and doom everyone else to, well, hell on Earth.

What is more egregious, though, is the peddling of the pernicious myth that christers might be persecuted right here in America. As if.  Some 76% of Americans identify themselves as christians (down from 86% in 1990, but still a vast majority by any standard).  Who is going to persecute them?  The Pentagon?  The local police?  The implication is that just as the Jews were rounded up and sent to `death camps' by Hitler and the SS, so too in America christers will be persecuted, rounded up and sent to FEMA `detention centers'.  It's as if the entire nation will turn into one big Waco or Ruby Ridge.  To drive the point home, there is a lame scenario involving an office drone/fundamentalist christer who is interrogated by Homeland Security to dramatize the fact that christers are the one group that needs to be wary of our government's information gathering capabilities.

Consistent with their persecution fantasy, these 'pundits' await the End Times and welcome the Day of Judgment when they will be shepherded to Heaven's Gate with their free passes.  It's a mad fantasy but they sound deadly serious.

Then there is Gary Kah, a first class know-nothing Manichean who actually claims that ""Pantheism leads to Satan worship.""  A risibly ignorant and preposterous remark. But certainly in keeping with the blinkered devotion he and all these christers have to distorting reality to fit their beliefs.

One of the difficulties of watching this film with an unbiased mind is that while on the one hand it seems to be an indictment of the neo-con Bush administration and the Bilderbergers, etc (cf, G. Edward Griffin, Daniel Estulin), on the other it also seems to endorse the weird extreme right wing Republicanism of the teabaggers (cf, Shaw etal).  There seems to be an undercurrent that is against the Patriot Acts yet that also promotes an anti-Progressive view.  Very jarring.  What's even more surprising is that I don't recall any sustained discussion of the NSA, the Pentagon (and its intelligence gathering capabilities), the CIA, etc, etc. whose powers increased dramatically after 9/11.  Certainly not by any of the christers.

And finally, the DVD does contain a bonus feature called ""Still Not Convinced?"" This is additional interview footage that essentially follows the same format as the feature.  To wit, commentary by academics followed by commentary by Jesus freaks. Reasonable sounding scholars followed up by ""church lady"" spin meisters.  If only they had made two documentaries:  one with scholars and independent researchers and the other with christian fundamentalists.",1269734400,8,6251,5.0634765625

Even a casual bible student should recognize that today the ground work is being set in place for the one world government that will be. But if one is not up to speed on what will be, this video should be a good introduction.

The video is from a protestant/evangelical Christian viewpoint. Non believers may not understand about the 'rapture', and setting up the one world government for the anti-christ and the rest of the 'great tribulation' as the Bible reads.

3946455,2,B002LFPBK6,"(Sigh.) I had only small hopes for this video because there is so much of this conspiracy stuff out there that I have been floating around for 25 years or more. But since this was from a Christian perspective I thought it would be different & better. It wasn't. I can honestly tell you DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this puff of smoke.
Like most conspiracy videos, this one is about 99.99% interviews with various people, and .01% evidence. I'm not exaggerating! Even a typical video about UFOs offers more evidence (like photos, footage, or eye-witness accounts) than Shadow Gov't which offers nothing of the kind, just far-off predictions & stuff we already know. If you like watching over an hour of different people & authors giving you their theories & predictions, but no one providing any real evidence of a shadow government, then you'll like this video.

The video starts by telling you that Google & the search engines save all of the info you enter when you search for something on the internet, & they also read all your Google email. Wow, I'm shocked. Also that there are cameras watching our streets & everywhere you go you are probably being filmed. Duh! That's the age we live in, there are cameras at the ATM & grocery store & airport, how this is proof we are being setup for a totalitarian society is beyond me? The credit card companies keep track of what we buy, no kidding? It shows up on my statement every month right?

The video is almost all interviews with different PhD types and conspiracy buffs who predict a one world gov't, & ends with an End Times scenario warning the viewer that one day we will lose our freedoms & live under a one world gov't. The video basically claims that there are high ranking members of the media at all the major news networks, as well as senators & supreme court justices that are either part of/in favor of a secret shadow government. Of course, no names or specifics are given! Probably because they don't have any real names & if they did the author would get sued for saying so.

I do believe we may one day live under a corrupt regime or have a secret gov't and we may be heading that way now as predicted in a biblical End-Times scenario...however this video does a VERY poor job of living up to its name, and really offers no new information. I learned basically nothing from watching it. The main theme is that technology is making all of this possible, information is being compiled & it is possible to track where people are going & what they are reading online, emailing, etc. However this is just one downside of the technology age--the convenience of using computers & ATMs does carry with it that your information may not be private any longer--but it is NOT proof of a shadow government or looming totalitarian regime. These types of videos that lack evidence & are mostly interviews have one common purpose in mind = make money off the public. How many of these kinds of videos does this author have anyway?",1268352000,22,2980,4.566355140186916

8372842,1,B002LFPBK6,"While I appreciate the topic which is very real, it seemed oversimplified. This is not a documemtary it is a hybrid or pseudo doc with fictional plot and actors. I would stear clear from this and look at Manufacturing Consent,  we already know coporate totalitarian state is where we live. Religious prophecies don't mean anything",1481414400,,330,5.0
8372843,1,B002LFPBK6,"This is a pseudo-documentary designed to disturb and indoctrinate rather than to inform.

As a veteran documentary producer, Im very familiar with what documentaries are & what they are not, and what phony documentaries look and sound like. This is definitely the latter.

The dark, disturbing images, the sinister soundtrack, the ominous voice reading a grim, alarming script full of nebulous, unsubstantiated implications are all designed to alarm and frighten, not inform & enlighten.

I have at times worked for PR firms, producing political adds, and this looks & sounds far more like a partisan negative political ad than a true documentary. The political and religious bias is obvious & crude, yet the subliminal messaging is slick & devious.

Any true documentary relies on concrete facts and verifiable evidence, not merely vague assertions & insinuations, as this does.

The marketing hook for this sort of programming is usually, why not have a look? in the hope that the naive viewer will be so disturbed and confused that he or she will swallow the bait and become drawn into the paranoid, cultish fundamentalist mentality.

It you must have a look, please keep in mind that everything you see herein is designed to disturb and indoctrinate rather than inform.",1463184000,,1273,5.125603864734299
