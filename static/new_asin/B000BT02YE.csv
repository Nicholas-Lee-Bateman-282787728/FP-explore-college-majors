2439705,5,B000BT02YE,"This video program truly encapsulates a life's work. This dedicated practitioner has indeed culled the essence of his many years of considerable research and presented it in an easy-to-understand and pleasing format. In fact, he and his team pull back the curtain on a show so mesmerizing you hardly realize you're watching a comprehensive overview of a system of ceremonial magick developed over decades of tireless individual and collaborative study and practical research. It makes readily accessible an otherwise complex ideology, granting entry to a rich and often exclusive world of mystery and history. Some of the earlier feminine imagery may seem a little dated, but only if viewed out of context and without knowledge of the strong, sovereign goddesses (like Inanna) of ancient times. (A flavor of this independent spirit of the ancient feminine can be found in stories of Inanna with Enki and Dumuzi. Some trace Astarte to Inanna.) This video can be a door-opener to vast and specialized knowledge for the sincere seeker. For anyone who wants to understand ceremonial magick and the subculture that embraces it, this DVD bears watching again and again.",1186099200,5,1163,5.224598930481283
2439706,5,B000BT02YE,"The difference between an Occultist and a Magician - is practice.  Messers Runyon and Jednack and the Ordo Templi Astarte have once again allowed us a peak into their world of magical practice.  Thabion's words are wise, the solstice ceremony shown in the video is inspiring and the silent eucharist celebration is meditative and thought provoking.  The music, although magical and true, gets a bit tedious to the viewer (although I'm sure it adds well to the actual ritual events depicted).

The beauty of Mr. Runyon's video offerings is that they allow students and practioners alike, insight into a well established and practicing magical temple.  They show actual ritual work...something not usually readily accessible to a student of the magical arts, which will (hopefully) inspire the armchair occultist to get off the couch and into circle!",1162512000,3,848,5.205882352941177
2439707,5,B000BT02YE,Poke has given the feeling and drama of very ancient rites in this DVD.  This is an excellent introduction to the various forms of magick that are practiced at the temple.  I am not with the OTO but believe Poke to be a divinely inspired individual demonstrating these teachings to all who will listen and learn.,1148601600,3,312,4.553571428571429
2439708,5,B000BT02YE,"Material presented is refreshingly well researched and original.  It's without confusing jargon, and illustrates and depicts pathworkings, their theory and history, to please the neophyte and seasoned practitioner equally. This is an excellent and professional DVD that combines theory and practice in an illuminating manner.

Usually not seen by the general public, this DVD contains magic and ritual in the purest form available today.  Great production value.  It tantalizes and teaches using all the senses.",1137715200,2,345,5.0

 I have been studying occult for years and read hundreds of books about the subject..Let me say we are so lucky to have his books and videos. If you haven't understand me let me say...when you read his books and watch videos , you'll realize something immediately. This guy knows what he's doing! He is an expert of the subject and you don't need to be clairvoyant to realize this..

 Every serious occult practitioner should get this DVD (Along with the ""Dark Mirror of Magick"" and ""The Magick of Solomon)

2439711,5,B000BT02YE,"With ""The Rites of Magick"", we have what is undoubtedly the best documentary on this subject to be made.  It contains a wealth of useful information, inspiring artwork, and surprising material--surprising because such things are usually reserved for the initiated.  I can only surmise that this is an example of an ""open secret"", where no matter how public something is, only those who have already spent time searching will recognize it.  Kudos to the author for covering so much territory with drama and style.",1135209600,8,512,5.071428571428571
2439712,5,B000BT02YE,"By Lon Milo DuQuette -- It is extremely difficult to properly address the highly esoteric aspects of ceremonial magick in a documentary film format. Perhaps that is why there are so few videos and DVDs currently available on the topic. There are several obvious reasons for this. First of all, the number of authorities qualified to comment upon the subject is exceedingly small. Secondly, among those who are qualified there are almost none who are able, willing or blessed with the talent and sense of audacious showmanship required to produce such projects. There is no question that Poke Runyon possesses in abundance that rare and magical combination of qualities, or that the world of the Hermetic arts and sciences is immeasurably enriched by his willingness to share so generously his knowledge, wisdom, and personality through the medium of sight and sound.

However, Runyon's newest offering, The Rites of Magick, is more than a visual textbook of magical theories and techniques (although there is a wealth of that in this DVD - so much in fact that the viewer will wish to review it several times to glean its precious jewels). It is quite literally an historic document - a record of real magick dramatically celebrated at the dawn of the late 20th century neo-pagan explosion. This window on magical history, in and of itself, makes this documentary a unique treasure.

Although I'm not a member of the Order of the Temple of Astarte, or the Church of Hermetic Sciences, Inc., I've admired Poke and his work for over 30 years. Like all pioneers of vision and genius he attracts his share of critics and detractors. This is to be expected, even welcomed by a man of Runyon's stature. In my opinion, The Rites of Magick is a beautiful and profound testament to the art of western magick, and perhaps the finest DVD of its kind ever produced.",1134432000,42,1853,4.842271293375394
2439713,3,B000BT02YE,"Im writing this review after watching this video as im hoping Frater Thabion who reviews books and DVD's on amazon also reads this.

I enjoyed The previous two dvd's as they tended to focus on one specific system of magick, this dvd just tended to focus around different things with no real concept of being useful in magick. The Enochian Watchtowers for instance was although grand and nice to look at, didn't prove useful at all.

Enochian magick is hard at best to understand, the Ameth, tables, how they inter link, the calls and so fourth which make this a working system of magick was left out of the equation. The newbie watches the Enochian watchtowers performed then says to himself, what next, scratching his head.

Because Enochian is so complex and hard to put together so it is workable it would of been better to focus all your attention on that system of magick. It is simply far more useful for students of Enoch, Goetia to fully grasp every aspect of each system as best as possible within the time frame.

I would estimate that 90 per cent of Enochian people who read books on this do not understand the system completely in how it is explained, linked, in books. Or it is confusing or time consuming, time consuming is exactly what it is.

I don't see how showing a Yoga working, pathworking which anyone would know is often down to a form of scrying, meditation so fourth. I also wouldn't class it as a rite of magick in that sense of the word, you are exploring your inner consciousness.

I would say with extreme confidence that if they created a dvd explaining how you view and use Enochian magick it would sell thousands of copies. Include all the tables, Sigil Dei Ameth chart, how the numbers relate to Clockwise, counter clockwise on the chart. Explain how each chart fits into another, how the angels relate horizontally within table 1, 2 and so fourth.

Also after watching both of the former DVD's it mentioned how they created and bought demons to physical appearance through a scrying mirror laid in the triangle. This is excellent, however it was mentioned on both DVD's which took up almost 30 minutes of viewing. This could of been summed up in 2 minutes leaving more information to the viewer on other aspects of Goetia which you could of been included. I sat there and thought will you get on with it.

I also had a little peeve with your views on Goetia in relation to self harm through negative magick. This is complete rubbish, although practical to a newbie to magick.

Think of a negative act of magick as a grenade sitting in your hand, if you don't let go you blow yourself up, letting go means exactly that. Non dwelling on the outcome tying yourself to the curse you thrown at an enemy or target. Out of conscious thought where possible, constructed in a way which doesn't tie you to it. Sometimes the things we want the most are the hardest to achieve mainly as it is not put out of conscious thought enough to materialise them. People dwell, lust, crave results after the working, then ask themselves why it fails to come to pass. Fire and forget as they say.

Perhaps a DVD on Esoteric Kabblah should also be done, another complex metamorphosis type creation which people, myself included find hard to understand and work with because of that.

Iv watched over ten Kabbalah DVD's from this site, read books, as yet I still have not grasped it, viewing it is like having a personal mentor one on one.

When is someone going to make a fortune from creating a decent Kabbalah or Enochian video, I would do it myself if I was knowledgeable enough on both? A fortune to be made, useful as well.

I didn't find this DVD useful to be honest and 30 minutes between the other two dvd's on scrying and how you creating this method is shocking. A waste of time, although to your credit it is useful in Goetia from using this method.

Less hyping your creation and more information that is useful for practitioners who use Enochian and Goetia weekly, or wish to use it weekly. For someone who watched this having no knowledge of Enochian would find the watchtowers just plain useless until they further there knowledge of it. Same as the 2 minutes or so in relation to the kabbalah.

Although im glad this video's are in circulation, I just wish they would explain in more detail aspects of systems instead of bits and pieces which offer nothing really useful. The Golden Dawn opening before all Goetia rituals was useful but they failed to show a banishing at the end even though they stated it was a must in all Goetia operations. People are going to replicate this environment so it should of been included in my opinion.

2439714,5,B000BT02YE,"The O.T.A.'s two previous productions: The Magick of Solomon and Dark Mirror of Magick ( both still available in up-dated, extended and enhanced ""Second Editions"" on DVD ) might be considered as ""the dark side"" of  magick. They both featured the evocation of spirits in a dark mirror by hypnotic conjuration and the distortion of facial reflection. Although not evil or even amoral, these two previous video documentaries were gothic in mood and tone. To uninformed and spiritually conservative viewers they may have seemed sinister.

In The Rites of Magick the producers have shown us a broader view of the magical process; one might say: The Magical Universe, because it is another world that magicians create with the power of their imaginations. This production takes us to the secluded estate where the O.T.A. conducts its training and rituals.

We are introduced to their yoga system, their astral journeying technique, their ancient seasonal rites, their own version of the Holy Grail ""Mass of the Elements,"" and a remarkable Enochian ritual based on the Elizabethan system of Dr. John Dee. As ""bonus feature"" we are treated to an artistic fantasy about ""the perils of alchemical experimentation.""

Some viewers may find the employment of ""Grail"" and ""Eucharist"" symbolism in non-Christian rituals to be disturbing even though the narrator explains their pagan origins, but with this one criticism accepted, this is otherwise an excellently produced, informative and inspiring production.",1131321600,10,1495,5.348936170212766

2439722,3,B000BT02YE,Its the basic overview of the OTAs other rituals and beliefs. There's only 20 or so minutes on each topic and its very introductory. It doesn't get deep into anything. Compared to The Magic of Solomon which was beginning to end. And unlike the magic of Solomon there wasn't anything as innovative as say how to use the magic mirror. The ritual was well done. It had the feel of a brochure video selling the OTA rather then a learning tool. The quality of the video is OK.,1301097600,12,471,4.363636363636363
2439723,5,B000BT02YE,"This is one of those videos worthy of pulling out at group meetings, or to show new initiates just so they can get a taste of a wide variety of ritual.

The Communion of the Elements ceremony was lovely as were the other rituals presented. I personally would highly recommend it.",1240272000,11,473,4.448275862068965
2439724,4,B000BT02YE,"""Poke"" Runyon is an interesting  man.  Former Green Beret who began seriously practicing magic and trance-work  as a way to alleviate stomach ulcers.

This video is eerie, fun, and essential viewing for the macabre and ceremonial magician types out there.  Here you will see his order perform a very interesting Tantric version of the GD Middle Pillar exercise, a group repast/celebration, a detailed pathworking, a variety of different shots  of LBRP, some ceremonies, and a very ominous Opening by Watchtower.  I've personally watched that Watchtower ceremony many times, and it gets a little eerier each time...perhaps due to Runyon's introductory description of the Enochian angels (they sound more like demons to me).  I  know I might get torched for that remark, but it's true...apocalyptic is too much for me.

Overall, I'd have given it 5 stars if it had a little less OTA specific ceremonies and more general info about things like sacred tools, invoking versus evoking,  and the like.  Still, a very watchable piece.",1206576000,10,1026,5.151515151515151
