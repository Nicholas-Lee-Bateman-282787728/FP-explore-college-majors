8121519,4,B000FELF1E,"I'm not sure why this is called ""Rossini's Visitor"" when the title seems to be ""[...]"". Anyway, like all the Feature Films for Families movies I've seen so far, this kid's comedy is perfectly safe and appropriate for all family members. Keep in mind it's just for fun, then have fun watching it.",1272931200,,295,4.584905660377358
8121520,5,B000FELF1E,My son and I both have judged the Feature Films for Families by the cover and were wrong on all of them. They are all great movies - we have watched 4 of them...including Brainiacs this afternoon and loved them all! He is 10 and I think they tell really good stories relating to around that age.,1149984000,,295,4.192982456140351
