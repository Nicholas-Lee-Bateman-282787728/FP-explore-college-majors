2578588,5,B000FOPPBA,Invasion is one of the best shows I have seen in a while.  I watched it every week. I can't believe ABC cancelled such a great show.  Instead they insisted on keeping the reality shows.  I am soooooo tired of reality shows.  I would hope that one of the other stations would be smart enough to pick it up.  I am definately pre-ordering this show.,1148256000,8,346,4.2615384615384615
2578589,5,B000FOPPBA,"This is why i quit watching network television. I might watch the local news and give the new season shows a shot. ""INVASION"" is the first series I've watched...you go Shaun Cassidy!  And doesn't surprise me that the boneheads at ABC dropped it...because it requires 'some thought' and 'reasoning' with views...and we all know most american tv viewers are...well, i'll be polite.

Great story (especially right after hurricanes Katrina & Rita), awesome production and visual effects, and casting could not have been better.

It's beyond me how 'Lost' is a hit. Maybe I'm wired different. Maybe ""I"" am a hybrid.

So long ABC...America's Big Catastrophe.

Anyone own Disney/ABC stock? Sell it. Tell them ""the hybrids made me do it"".",1148256000,7,730,5.100840336134453
2578590,5,B000FOPPBA,"Once in a while, if you're lucky, you find a show that you adore. And if you're really lucky, it sticks around. I guess I might only be half lucky. A few years ago, I fell in love with Firefly, a great show on FOX that lasted eleven episodes and was shown out of order. (Thankfully, Serenity was made.) Invasion is like Firefly, it's a great show that was marked badly by its network. It was a show I fell in love with.

The show is thought of as a `sci-fi' drama. But, it is so much more then that. It's a show about being different, about family, about people. More then the mystery of what exactly hybrids are, Invasion's main focus always seemed to be about the two families and how each person deals with the events and aftermath of hurricane Eve, and how it affects their relationships within the two families.

The series starts off slow, exploring different issues and bringing up several questions: What were the lights in the water? Why are some people different after Eve? What, if anything, does the military have to do with everything and what do they know? And what exactly is Sheriff Tom Underlay (William Fichtner, who gives one of his best performances) hiding? There is also the issues of Tom's wife, Dr. Mariel Underlay (played wonderfully by Kari Matchett), who is found naked in the water after Eve, and now also finds herself oddly attracted to water and not quite herself.

And that is where the show really takes off. As Mariel beings to question everything, she finds herself moving away from Tom and toward her ex-husband, Russell Varon (Eddie Cibrian), a park ranger. The two share two children, but they also share a bond. Something that doesn't always sit well with Russell's new wife, Larkin Groves (Lisa Sheridan), a local news reporter with whom Russ is expecting a third child.

Oh, and did I mention that Larkin wants to find out what the military knows? Something that often puts her (and her unborn child) in danger.

The rest of the cast is also brilliant and their characters loveable. Mariel and Russell have two children ,high-schooler Jesse (Evan Peters, who really starts to show his acting talents toward the end of the season), a shy boy whose got a crush on his stepsister. And cutie Rose (Ariel Gade), who is very insightful about her mother and the whole `is a hybrid still who they once were' issue. Rounding out the Varon-Groves family is, Larkin's older brother, Dave (Tyler Labine), a conspiracy-theory lover, who is convinced that some sort of alien force has come out of the sky in the cover of a hurricane and is plotting something big.

While, the first half of the season is slow and takes time to explore the mysteries and the shifting dynamic between the families, the second half of the season takes a much more serious and darker turn. It begins when Tom has his favorite deputy, Lewis Sirk (Nathan Baesel), take a shocking step to protect them and others like them. And continues when Tom's daughter, Kira (Alexis Dziena, who gives some lovely performances in the later episodes.) begins to wonder what  happens in the water and why hasn`t it happened to her...

Things get much worse when it is revealed that Eli Szura (James Frain, who gives a wonderfully creepy performance), a man Tom has been working with in dealing with ceratin 'issues', may know more then anyone about what is really happening and that he has a plan, a plan that could put everyone in serious danger...",1148256000,13,3438,4.661716171617162
2578591,5,B000FOPPBA,"IT HAPPENS AGAIN.  ANOTHER WELL DONE & ""EDGE OF THE SEAT SERIES"" BITES THE NETWORK DUST.  WITH LUCK CABLE WILL SEE THE LIGHTS DROPPING OUT OF THE SKY & PICK-UP THE SERIES.",1148169600,6,171,4.3125
2578592,5,B000FOPPBA,"Shaun Cassidy's INVASION is prepared to wrap up its first (perhaps only?) season with a 1 hour finale tonight at 10 pm on ABC. This is the 22nd episode in a season full of brilliant, intelligent, fun and fierce pseudo-science fiction. It's more than that...

INVASION is as much about family and the ever changing dynamic within two families as it is about the alien invasion that comes down in a hurricane in the form of lights and gradually takes over the small town of Homestead, Florida.

The show stars William Fichtner as creepy but effective Sheriff Tom Underlay, a man who seems to know what is going on, but may not be as ""in the loop"" as he thinks. His wife is Dr. Mariel Underlay (Kari Matchett), a family woman and town physician suddenly thrust seemingly overnight into a cold, detached disillusionment. She doesn't know what's happened with those lights in the sky, but her kids don't recognize her anymore (not ""inside,"" anyway)...

Eddie Cibrian is Mariel's former husband Russell Varon, a park ranger who has two kids with his ex-wife and is currently married to Larkin Groves (Lisa Sheridan), a local news reporter with whom Russ is expecting a third child...

Those first two kids would be high-school-age Jesse (Evan Peters) and cute as a button 1st grader Rose (Ariel Gade). While Rose is wide-eyed with wonder over the events during and after the hurricane, concerned for her mother, confused by her sudden frequency of being missing, Jesse is growing increasingly paranoid - enough so to match his new uncle Dave (Tyler Labine), a conspiracy-theory-spouting blogger who is convinced (correctly) that some sort of alien force has come out of the sky in the cover of a hurricane and is plotting something...

Whether Sheriff Tom (who Rose calls ""Daddy/Uncle Tom"") is behind this ""invasion"" is up for debate, but the shifting dynamic between the two families is only magnified by the increasingly erratic behavior of Tom's own daughter, Kira (Alexis Dziena from ""Broken Flowers""). She has never quite felt like she belonged, and the sudden ""invasion"" of her parents makes her feel less and less like she fits in...

The season took a real turn when it was revealed that a man named Eli Szura (special guest star James Frain of ""Where the Heart Is..."" fame) was behind the impending alien invasion, knew more than anyone could've about the hurricane, the lights in the sky, etc., and that he had been working with Tom, only to go behind his back and take things way too far...

Where it ends up is anybody's guess. Tonight is the season (series?) finale of ""INVASION"" entitled ""The Last Wave Goodbye"" (not a good sign), and yet it appears to end on a cliffhanger...

INVASION is a huge hit with critics like TV Guide and seems to be the best-received new show of the season critically. I hope ABC renews it, but that appears to have fallen through. Rumor has it that the new hybrid network the C/W (UPN/WB) will join forces to bring the show over to the new joint venture and that would be fantastic! What better way to watch a show about hybrids than on a hybrid network?!?",1147824000,61,3093,4.736059479553903

2578611,2,B000FOPPBA,"I just don't see how people liked this show, yes, it will hold your interest, but for different reasons than expected.

 Hubbie and I say that Invasion was made in someone's basement, on the cheap. First of all, even if you do get ""into"" the show, the series was cancelled, so it just ends with the last disk. You never will find out what happens.

I gave the show 2 stars for the ""entertainment"" value. The producers did absolutely no research, spend $195 to make it- if that much, nor did they even try to make it believable.

1) There are shots of a lagoon (and the characters are getting out of a boat) that you can see is a pool with a backdrop.

2) There is a scene where during a hurricane the characters are driving ""north on Alligator Alley"" out of town. I don't even live in Florida but know that Alligator Alley goes East/ West, NOT North/ South.

3) The sheriff's department has a 1- armed deputy ( a major character). He must be very proficient restraining and handcuffing a suspect. (If they made him in the office/ dispatch, etc I'd say OK, they hired handicapped and that's good PR)

4) During an evacuation (due to a storm) the characters leave their home with the family cat in a carrier. There is 1 shot when the little girl is holding the carrier and turns and you can see that the carrier is empty.

5) During the upcoming hurricane, the characters are putting plywood up on the windows, but are putting the boards on the inside of the glass. If you live in Florida, you know it goes on the outside. Plus the room was a greenhouse type of thing and the ceiling was glass.

The list goes on and on..... No wonder the show was cancelled.

Don't buy the DVDs,  get it from the local library and watch it and see how many things you can find. It's almost like playing ""Find Waldo."" The are cheap, faux pas thru out the whole show. It will leave you either groaning or laughing, maybe both. And it's a shame because I think with some effect it would have been a decent show.",1490054400,,1990,4.3083109919571045

2578645,3,B000FOPPBA,"Ever since the popularity of LOST, ABC has been trying to find another strange, prime-time, sci-fi series to fill the void. One of the better ones was Invasion. This show managed to last a full season, but just like V, Flash-Forward, Life On Mars, Persons Unknown, Surface, and so many others, it didn't last. Why not you may ask? The truth is that the network keeps using these great show ideas and either takes them off the air for months in order to air some lame reality show or in this case, they keep making it stranger and stranger until it's unwatchable. LOST was weird, that's what we loved about it, but that show was written by J.J. Abrams, not Shaun Cassidy. Some people can make weird work and some just can't!

Invasion takes place in a small town bordering the Florida everglades, where a strange family dynamic is taking place. The Varon family has split up and the kids spend half the time with their father, Russell (Eddie Cibrian), a park ranger who is engaged to a local reporter, and their mother, Mariel, who is a Doctor and whom has remarried the town sheriff, who also has a daughter. Going back and fourth between fighting parents is hard enough, but in an area as dangerous as the everglades, it can be downright deadly. One night, a massive storm blows into town and people see strange lights in the sky and in the water. When things settle down, certain people are somehow different. Some, like Russell, are skeptical that anything happened, others like his brother-in-law to be, think the planet is under attack, but no one really knows what the truth is.

This is a modern version of invasion of the body snatchers and a much more subtle version at that. The series starts off with a bang and is definitely binge worthy, but then it hits a brick wall. I mean it is the same thing around and around for about ten episodes and it is ridiculously frustrating. Things finally get going again, and it just becomes weird, they jump back to story lines they haven't mentioned since the pilot, they investigate things they never mentioned before, the show is really kind of all over the place and it just gets worse.

Shows like this kill me, because it started out so good, the story was extremely promising, and best of all was the cast. William Fichtner best known for Prison Break and dozens of blockbuster films is one of my favorite actors, and he is amazing in this show, there are points in Invasion, where he keeps the whole thing together and I may have stopped watching, if I wasn't so interested in what his character was up to. Paired with Third Watch's hunky fireman, Eddie Cibrian, the pair make for perfect rivals and strange bedfellows, and oddly had terrific chemistry. Add veteran actress, Lisa Sheridan, and a sixteen year old future TV star named, Evan Peters, to the mix, and this cast was fantastic.

The bottom line is this show should have worked, it should have lasted, but ABC wanted it to be the next LOST. Someone kept messing with the story at the last minute, until the point that even the writers were confused about what they were doing, and things just fell apart. It's a shame, the first few episodes of this show were as good as it gets, while the last dozen or so were a struggle to get through.",1471651200,,3254,4.547781569965871

What really makes this drama impressive is the very talented, and believable cast, and the human element that drives it.  Although it is meant to be about aliens (or something deeper - you'll have to watch to find out), the characters and the way they interact with each other makes this a really compelling series.  There are many moral questions that get thrown around in this series, causing the viewer to really think about what the individual characters are trying to accomplish.

An interesting premise, good and believable actors, and pretty good dialogue made this a very enjoyable series to watch, especially when you can run and re-run the episodes at your leisure.  I found myself pulling for certain of the characters, which is always a good indication.  There were a couple of lapses in believability related to the ""invaders"", but - regrettably - isn't that nearly always the case with science fiction movies?  I plan to watch it again periodically in the future, and overall, I give it high marks.  I think even if you're not a science fiction fan (which I definitely am) you might find this enjoyable, as so much of it is relatively believable and well done to boot.",1435276800,,815,4.593103448275862

2578776,4,B000FOPPBA,"This is yet another sci-fi series that makes me wonder why so many fine sci-fi shows only last 1 season. Invasion featured good actors, properly executed scripts, and reasonable special effects. I think this type of show doesn't appeal to a broad enough audience, in this case not cornering the younger demographic that a show like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-100/dp/B00KO72Y0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 100</a>&nbsp;brings in. The character Jesse was meant to appeal to the stereotypical awkward adolescent male sci-fi fan (with the episode of the mind-wiped sorority girl who takes a bath with Jesse as an obvious example of pandering to the teen geek fantasy of scoring with a girl who under ordinary circumstances is out of reach), and the actor Alexis Dziena was thrown into the core cast to attract Jesse (and presumably, viewers like him), but this obviously wasn't a broad enough target demographic.

Yet even the devastatingly handsome protagonist Edward Cibrian and his super-cute costar Lisa Sheridan (both are good actors as well as being good-looking) apparently were not enough to pull Invasion into a 2nd season... they just weren't young enough to get The 100 crowd watching. And since I've started picking on The 100, I might as well go on to say that Invasion is better than The 100 by most counts: superior dialogue, a more coherent storyline (less nonsensical than The 100, but that's not saying much), and an ample amount of philosophy (as all sci-fi should have). The show also had one of the best child actors I've seen in a long time: Ariel Gade. I was impressed at how intelligent and refined Ariel was in presenting her character. Furthermore, the comic relief character, played by Tyler Labine, was a breath of fresh air.

Invasion didn't grab me right away, but by the end of the first disc I was hooked. If I hadn't been watching so many other shows simultaneously, this would have been a binge-watch serial for me. Highly recommended if you like spooky sci-fi in the tradition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers/dp/B009OPMX3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>.",1419552000,4,2248,5.589442815249267

You will quickly get hooked, the story moves along quickly and smoothly, and the writing is excellent BUT... the series ended before completion.  This leaves the last episode with many unanswered questions and a cliffhanger.  I just wished they could have filmed at least one last episode to close the book if they knew it was not going to be renewed for a second season.

Although the story line did remind me of the Invasion of The Body Snatchers there was still a great deal of the story line/plot that was original that keep me sitting on the edge of my seat.  I am looking forward to Season 2 (am actually searching for it).  I would recommend this to any sci-fi/drama/action buff as they tha all rolled into one.  A great cast some with familiar actors and some new ones. Rose was a delight as one of the youngest where I have seen her before I can't place her.  What is great about is you never know who is taken by the aliens and who isn't.  I truly miss guessed on a few of the towns people; saddened to discover others weren't taken.

Another one season wonder that thought it would have a Season 2 based on the ending.  Not too much dragging it down, which is a primary problem with a new series.  22 episodes so it was a real treat vs. the 10-12 that we've been getting too much of.  Wish it would have continued as I really got into it.  The ending was very cool.

Set in the Everglades, it rains bunches and bunches, kind of like Seattle in the Killing.  Gives the series a feeling of dread.

2578860,1,B000FOPPBA,"There is so much bad about this series I will start with what I thought was good; there were a couple of scenes where the creatures attack humans that were well done; especially when a creature takes the deputy sheriff. Also the scenes where the little 6-year-old girl is acting. The rest of the cast was poorly selected. The producers failed to ensure there was continuality in the series and they failed to have a military coordinator help them. The Sheriff claims to have been a CAPTAIN in the Air Force but all the scenes of him in uniform are as a LIEUTENANT COLONEL. He also tells a female colonel he retired a MAJOR--again he was shown as a LIEUTENANT COLONEL.

The credibility of the series fails. The military would not KNOW about an invasive species and then let a whole community fall prey; a park ranger would not run around unarmed for half the series with HIS family threatened; a sheriff and park ranger would not go after 100 armed adults with only a shotgun w/15 rounds and a pistol; the high school scenes go no where; giving Jessie a revolver--and then he never uses it ; the slamming door incident with the uncle where they use the SAME slamming door THREE times!; the sheriff being shot three times and heals in three days--yet his deputy's face takes weeks to heal; having the deputy cut off his arm with a chain saw--absolutely unrealistic and obviously the writer has never used a chainsaw! On and on...error after error.

The writer does well when he writes scenes about what he KNOWS about--a dysfunctional his/hers/ours family and those scenes are a soap opera--but he totally fails when he writes about subjects he knows NOTHING about; military, killing, swamps, weapons.

The worse part is trying to sell the viewer on the high-breeds are good creatures and they let pregnant humans be taken by them! Also throughout the whole series the uncle and the reporter are trying to PROVE the existence of these beings and the PROOF is given to them in the first couple of shows--THEIR BLOOD IS DIFFERENT THAN OURS! Also, throughout the series we are made to believe these creatures are GOOD--they KILL the human and replace the original human!

Absolutely poorly done--the only people rating this above a one star are relatives of the cast and crew! I am so disgusted with this series I will not waste anymore time proof reading what I wrote!",1390953600,4,2364,4.6891566265060245

2578880,4,B000FOPPBA,"Invasion - The Complete Series - DVD

Description:
""Invasion"" is an American science-fiction series shown on ABC starting September 21, 2005. The show was not renewed for a 2nd season so the DVD subtitled ""The Complete Series"" is, in fact true - 22 episodes which is all the 1st seasons shows.  The series tells the story of water based creatures (seeded from another planet?) that ""merge"" DNA with humans caught up in the aftermath of a Florida hurricane. The creatures appearance, origins, plans etc. are never explored but they are always a hovering presents - sometimes off stage - throughout each episode. The cloning effects are dramatized through two families in the semi-isolated town of Homestead Florida. The show was produced by Shaun Cassidy Productions and Warner Bros. Television.

  The shows should by watched in sequence since events are carried over from episode to episode.

Pros:
  I watch the entire series over the period of several weeks - no marathon view feast for me. The science-fiction aspect of the show was subservient to the interactions of the two dysfunctional families both of which are affected by the mutant effects of the aliens. The creative talents did, in my estimation, an excellent job keeping family tensions and ""weirdness' in balance.

  Although filmed in California the extensive depictions of swamps and 'glades and a small town Florida in the far southern wetlands were very authentic.

 Cons:
  There were so many incredible coincidences in this series I was at a lost, and could only exclaim to my spouse ""unbelievable!""

Packaging:
  The six DVD's are housed in a solid fan-fold case that slide in an external box. Each disk has a color picture of a principal actor. An excellent piece of packaging.

Recommendations:
  This is a well acted off-beat SF series that appealed to me. The 22 episodes tell an interesting story that apparently did not resonate with the suits so it was not renewed - so be it, what resulted can be enjoyed.",1381795200,,1986,4.957575757575758

2578898,3,B000FOPPBA,"This particular series was good but, to many unanswered questions.  Question 1. Where did the lights come from?  2. The military never brought in scientist to find out about the ""orange"" things in the water. Not even the CIA investigated past ""there here"" and only a Colonel was conducting experiments in an unsecured facility.  Who was in charge? 3.  A hurricane destroyed a whole town while lights were dropping out of the sky and no radar, satellite, webcam saw anything, where was big brother? 4. The main characters knew what was happening and still they bickered about ""custody, jobs, who's screwing who, instead of where is my car, my roof is gone.  and 5. like most horror movies and movies with explosions, everyone ran toward the horror and explosions instead of just running away.  For all of the ""Intelligent"" characters-doctor, sheriff, park ranger, reporter, CIA, military, no one could put two and two together to come up with a credible theory or answers.

There were some interesting parts that gave it the Stephan King quality.  The deputy questioning God.(great acting by the way) The sheriff convincing the deputy to cut off his arm. The 3rd party camera shots, the wedding ring.

My favorite parts where when they started calling the people that were duplicated ""hybrids."" All the while the main cast of characters were in a hybrid family. God, Darwinism, and Robin Hood all used differently than most people believe.

All n all it was a good story, good acting but the writing failed at credibility.",1373241600,,1521,4.90625

2578903,4,B000FOPPBA,"A Florida town is hit by a hurricane, but that isn't the worst of their problems.  The water has something strange and glowing in it and it is affecting how people act.  Whatever it is it isn't something normal from Earth.  The park ranger and sheriff try to determine what is going on, but no one trusts anyone else and everything is kept secret.  Afterall some could be in on it, or maybe even aliens.  Military planes and crew have crashed and gone missing and then crew have emerged without a scratch and acting different.  Is it a government coverup?  Are they in on it with aliens?

Great price on a decent SciFi Series.  At the time this was first aired, 2005, I actually was more of a fan to Threshold, but now I am glad this is on DVD because it is quite good.  It is sad that it was a bad year for SciFi.  Two good and one fair series were short lived shows ""Threshold"", Invasion, and ""Surface"".  I certainly watched all three and I find this one is well worth owning for the current price and adding to your library.

I highly recommend this series.  I just wish they could have had at least one more season.  The conclusion to the one season leaves some questions, but it is still well worth viewing and owning.  Shaun Cassidy was the major contributor to creating and producing this series.  Unfortunately like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roar-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000GGSMO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roar - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;it was cancelled short of it's potential.  I must say Cassidy comes up with great material and it seems so unfair that he isn't truly given a chance to let audiences show their support until after a series is cancelled.

I often joke with my brother, claiming the cancellation of this show to be the greatest letdown of my life! There may actually be some real emotion behind all of that talk. This show is a genuine 10/10!

Question for the hardcore fans...

I remember when the series finale aired, there was a little ""preview"" during the end credits. The clip showed Tom Underlay running along the beach. I assume this was either a deleted scene or an extra scene they had filmed in preparation for the second season. Does anyone have any info on this clip, or know where I could find it? Thanks!",1367366400,,895,4.552795031055901
2578911,2,B000FOPPBA,"This is a show that gets extremely hit and miss. the show starts off with a simple enough yet interesting enough an average idea that should attract any alien movie/series fans. orange glowly things attack people in the water and if they are accepted they come back ""different"" as the show loves to call them as the later term hybrids seems to offend hybrids or ""different"" people. if rejected you end up with scars on your body....the one exception happens to the sheriffs daughter who gets rejected but suffers 0 scars because well women must look hot on TV at all times amirite guys???

yea the show can do good parts such as the subtle plot the alien hybrids craft to take over....but then it can be extremely stupid. the characters turn on each and make up at a rate of every other scene. yes its explained normally but it gets annoying. their also seems to be entirely too much focus on mindless drama. it seems the characters cannot accept the overwhelming amount of evidence that they all see in front of their faces. also no one seems at all freaked out by this bodysnatchers thing going on. and its not until disc 5 where the son of one of these body snatchers blurts out NO YOU ARE NOT MY MOTHER ANYMORE. thats about as much as the show acknowledges that no these hybrids are not people like us. its ok the son makes up with mommy because again the characters flip-flop like a mad man on crack when it comes to whether they are angry with someone or not.

the real inexplicable problems arise towards the final few episodes where the show suffers from the clear screw it we are cancelled syndrome lets just throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks. in one of these final episodes the two lead adult male characters take on a well trained army 2 vs 50 with no trouble. mind you the 50 are these hybrids. later a group of preganant hybrids(the offspring is revealed as the greatest threat they are all fearing) are inexplicably saved by one of these lead male characters and his ex-wife. why you ask? because we cant kill them. thats it. your threat to the entire earth is saved because killing is wrong. thats the excuse. the show ends on a major cliffhanger as well because screw proper wrap ups.

there are other inexplicable thintgs before the final episodes. a man gets his arm grown back after getting changed in the water. the sheriff tells him to cut it back off because people fear change. so he does. this takes no more than 3 minutes of persauding which is just alarming. he then gets pissed off at the sheriff after wards. then forgives the man. the source of his anger is he thought the sheriff was a God believing Christian. not ya know the fact he was an idiot and chainsawed off his own arm with no sedatives at all.

the women however are just downright stupid. they all want their husband home at all times. whats that honey? stopping aliens? thats nice dear WHY ARENT YOU HOME??? oh mr. husband sheriff you locked up that mad serial rapist you say? well i am pissed because you did not call me like you said you would. one blurts out she is preganent 6 times an episode and when not blurting this out she is holding her belly or touching it or her husband mentions she is preganent or some other character does the honor of saying it. the other lead female adult mother despite being a hybrid insists repeatedly she is still the mother of her children. in the last episode a deranged gun man is persuaded to not go in insane by the ramblings of a 7 year old girl because absolutely screw logic because she says his now changed mother is still mommy just different....NO YOU FOOLS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHANGED DIE. this is established repeatedly in the show. all the main characters know it. these people die. they take over your body....make a brand new copy of it and dispose of the old one in the water which we are shown repeatedly. the characters all know this. in fact you are even treated to one that didn't finish attacking and taking over and you see a multilated unfinished hybrid. again these things kill you. speaking of the half dead unfinished one....the main characters it visits and dies on...in the next episode or later in the same episode i cant remember. they decide lets go bug my ex-wife to run DNA tests on....yet completely ignore their dead hybrid they had last night???? seriously???

despite this the acting is solid. the sheriff does his part well. the consipiracy theory guy truly looks and plays the role. everyone acts well and the story is told well enough its just nothing happens by the end. and there is erractic plothole filled writing through and through. if nothing some of the writing is laughably bad at points. but its biggest fault is it REPEATS ITSELF. i don't need to hear im pregnant every 5 minutes. i don't need to hear a divorced couple fighting over the kids every 5 minutes...speaking of that they flip flop repeatedly. one second they are going to kill each other the next they arent. speaking of laughably bad moments one actor shoots her one ally for no reason at all. none. not one reason. its so bad and random its hilarious.

one phrase i repeated a lot while watching....""this wouldnt be a problem if you weren't such a female dog""....and thats this show in a nutshell. hilarious at times. interesting at others. and just randomly insane with bad writing in others. and the female characters repeatedly without fail act like ""female dogs"" and create mindless drama over the stupidest of things and get in the way constantly. they serve as nothing more than drama queens.

for 15 and under have at it. anything more and don't bother. it has aliens invasion of the body snatchers going for it. orange glowy things. hurricanes. terrible plots that are laughable yet genious in other areas. and a good few twists and turns.",1367107200,,5804,4.537726838586438

It's a mix of the body snatchers and other sci fi flicks. Only I think in this one the people are just in new bodies , that are merged with the aliens. That's what made body snatchers so good , and it works here too!.  This one has great characters though and a interesting storyline. What do the water aliens want? maybe they are from earth and just decided to do something about man's messing up the world now? or what? well we never got to find out sadly because the show ended.

2578960,3,B000FOPPBA,"The review on the box says """"As well written, well acted, and intensely focused a piece of television as you'll find anywhere on the tube.""  Ellen Gray, Philadelphia Daily News.

Ellen was very gracious but I have to offer an example of why I disagree with her assessment.

After reading the reviews, I got this ""Complete Series"" for $6 and it's worth that.  The show has quite a few good actors but the acting is a bit too melodramatic for me.  Overall however, it's a good sci-fi idea and soap opera.  I know others will find this nit picky, but it's about the writing and lack of focus that got to me.  Here is a small example/spoiler for one episode - a character turns off a main road thinking they're being followed and ends up flipping their car, then they are ""trapped by a seatbelt buckle release malfunction"" - yeah right - how trite can you get. One might slip out of a seat belt - but then I guess the seat belt tensioners are broken too - Murhy's Law I guess.  All the while their hand held radio is just inches out of reach as the other spouse is calling to check on their whereabouts.  After an ample of amount of writhing about, the character knocks the mirror off the windshield and breaks it to cut themselves out - then kicks the front window out with their foot (again if you could get your foot up over the dash, I would have thought they had room to just slip out of the seatbelt)..at any rate, all the while their hand held radio is just inches out of their reach.  So I'm wondering why not use the mirror to rake the radio toward you??!?!.

BUT THEN, mysteriously the vehicle moves to slightly deeper water implying they're in even more danger...(you can't miss the mystery because the music cues are so obvious, there's no doubt when to clinch for the ""action""...anyway, they managed to get out of the vehicle and apparently leave the radio behind - this time however, no mystery music as they forget the radio or lonely/sorrowful music cue as the radio is left behind.

Fortunately the spouse had been wondering about where their loved one is and went out to find them...and find them they did in short order.  ALL of Florida, ALL of the Everglades and the sleuthful Park Ranger happens across a back road where the missing spouse's vehicle is found upside down and empty.  As they leave this scene - the characters and a cop are the only ones on site and when they leave to the left of the scene, on the right side of the screen is another person fumbling around in the background...haha  off road middle of Everglades and hey, no one noticed the guy in the background?!?!

BUT then there's the glaring issue of the missing spouse involved in the accident.  That person could have simply went back up the ROAD they came down, after all the other spouse and cop just came down that very road, BUT apparently the dazed and confused spouse goes fumbling through the Everglades to be picked up and and and so the story goes...aye yai yai it's just so unbelievable at times and better writing would not leave you wondering WHY!!!... I'm on disk 3 (of 6 at the moment, and it's hard to imagine how the show was on the air it as long as it was, but I'm hopeful it will get better...",1353456000,,3202,4.4

2578980,5,B000FOPPBA,"Are you looking for intelligently written, character driven science-fiction? If you are, ""Invasion"" is an excellent choice. The short-lived TV series survived for just a single season in 2005-2006, but had ideas - and talent - enough for a multi-year run. While none of the actors and actresses in the series are household names (probably the best-recognized is character actor is William Fichtner, who plays antihero Sheriff Tom Underlay), all are extremely capable and believable in their roles. Unlike a lot of science-fiction TV series, it wasn't written and marketed exclusively to a teen audience and although some elements of the show are reminiscent of ""The X-Files,"" the program never settled into a ""Freak of the Week"" holding pattern between story arcs. These two factors make a lot of demands on the audience's attention span, and it's no surprise that ""Invasion"" plays much better on DVD than when it was on TV. (Personally, I gave up on the show back then because I missed a couple of episodes and couldn't catch up on the plot. I think my experience was a fairly common one.)

""Invasion"" is the sort of TV show that is extremely sensitive to spoilers, so I won't reveal too much about the plot except the very bare bones. In the aftermath of a hurricane, the some of the residents of a small Florida town start behaving very strangely in ways varying from subtle to extreme. Some claim that unexplained lights appeared in the sky right around the time of the hurricane, but what really happened? And why can't any of the recovered ""survivors"" remember exactly what happened to them why they were missing. The story echoes ""The Tommyknockers"" in spots, as well as the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and even good old H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Shadow over Innsmouth"" but it really speaks to our own post 9/11 disaster culture more than anything. There's a creeping sense of dread and desperation throughout these episodes, which makes the few sudden shocks stand out even more. This is definitely a TV series designed to appeal to thinkers, and it holds up well upon multiple viewings, because it's often quite subtle.

Unfortunately, the DVD set lacks some features that we often take for granted. There are no foreign language soundtracks, and while Spanish, French, Portuguese, and even Chinese are included as subtitles there are no English subtitles. Extras are minimal - just a few deleted scenes and a very brief promo tagged onto the 6th disc. There are no commentary tracks (a true letdown), no post-season cast interviews, and no adjunct materials such as the original Hurricane Katrina disclaimer that originally appeared with the pilot episode. Yes, I know that ""Invasion"" was dumped by ABC and therefore isn't considered a marquee-quality series, but I do think that the series deserved a better DVD release. It always irritates me when some series are given DVD releases that are overflowing with extras and some are not. This is definitely an overlooked series that deserved a bit more love in the DVD release, but I did not detract points for this.",1342396800,2,3084,4.940269749518304

2578988,5,B000FOPPBA,"Invasion is one of the best TV series ever aired on ABC. I was entranced from the beginning to the end.  ABC canceled the series after one season with a cliffhanger finale.  I was flabbergasted that ABC didn't give the series a chance to liftoff, leaving viewers wondering what happened to Russell's pregnant wife Larkin after she was accidently shot.  Sheriff Tom was trying to save her life, and took her to the lake and put her into the water.  Mariel and Russell saw Tom's car and stopped to see what was wrong.  They asked:  ""What Happened.""  To cancel the series is ABC's choice, but on the other hand, why leave a Cliffhanger?  If the series was in the works to be canceled by ABC, it was unfair to leave the viewers wondering.

The story line is about two families that are close.  Mariel and Russell are divorced and have two children, a teenage son Jessie, and daughter Rose, a second grader.  Rose is a sweetheart. Mariel remarried to Sheriff Tom who has a teenager daughter Kira.  Russell remarried as well to Larkin, who is pregnant and works for the local TV station.  During the hurricane, Mariel disappeared, and when she returned, Jessie and Rose told their father Russell that their mom was acting weird.

During the storm, Rose sees bright lights coming down from the sky and landing in the water. When the Hurricane was over, some of the town folks were acting differently. At first, they were confused, then acting very strange about water and an impulse to drink water.  Afterwards, some folks acted almost normal and others became mean-spirited.

Tom Underlay was a Major in the Air Force when his plane crashed into a lake.  Then he retired went to work for the Sheriff's Department.  He was the only survivor of the lake crash, and was a Hybrid.  Homestead Air Force Base had known about the Hybrids' in the lake for years and had known that Tom was a Hybrid.  Consequently, it was a military cover-up to do experiments on the Hybrids in a secret location on the base.

These aren't you normal aliens' as in Invasion of the Body Snatchers. They are Hybrids which you can't tell apart from humans.  Some of the Hybrids hadn't changed at all and were aware of their transformation.  They didn't want any part of the Hybrid group that was having meetings.  Sheriff Tom was the good guy, and he tried his best to help the town folks to adjust.  Eli Szura betrayed Tom.  Szura took charge of the group and was controlling them.  Mariel, Larkin, and the children were on their way to leave town before the hurricane. They were being rounded up by the National Guards/Hybrids when their car was hit by a fallen tree.",1333152000,6,2634,4.5965665236051505

2578997,4,B000FOPPBA,"My minor tribute to Mr. Cassidy aside and perhaps a 1/2-star is do the current hiatus in the TV schedule.  However, I really did enjoy this and thought that the drama actually gained momentum (respectfully disagreeing with other reviewers that thought the show peaked early).  The last 3-episodes were 5*

Without offering any spoilers, what I most liked about the show was that there was a fair amount of ""gray"" and even when the sides were more clearly defined, there were both ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" in each camp.

While the entire cast did workman like jobs, IMHO, the writing was better than the acting (again, respectfully disagreeing with some of the other reviewers) and with the exception of Rose (the youngest daughter, who did a great job), I felt that the script was tight enough to plug in and play.

In summary, this was not one of those series that caused me to lose sleep, though it did keep me interested.  Furthermore, once the lines became more clearly defined, there was easily a number of directions that the writers could have taken the show.  A 2nd season to see how things developed was much deserved.

I stated in other reviews that I generally will not take cost into account, though I picked this up at an FYE clearance for +-$7.  Amazon offers this used for as low as $4.99 and at that price, if you are cost conscious, I would challenge anyone to dispute the entertainment value.",1325462400,,1412,4.63855421686747

2579018,3,B000FOPPBA,"If you've read the reviews on here, you'll know by now that Invasion was not completed in any way.  So 'The Complete Series' means that this set has all the episodes shot, it doesn't mean that there's a conclusion.  I knew that going in, but I liked the premise, and when the price came down low enough, I snagged it (it helped me reach the $25 free shipping minimum).  Was it worth it?  For $8.49, you bet.  If I'd paid $40 for it, I'd have been a bit honked off.

The premise of Invasion is aliens quietly invading a small town in Florida.  They're not little green men, but indeed come disguised as squid type creatures....or not disguised and they actually are like that.  They arrive years before the start of the series, but begin their 'attack' during and after a hurricane hits the town.  They take people over and essentially 'replace' them, though the person retains their memories and such.  That's the premise that Shaun Cassidy (American Gothic) and his people sold ABC, and they bought it.  The trouble was, all the creators had was a premise and some character ideas.

The show revolves around a large extended family:  Sheriff Tom Underlay (William Fichtner), his wife Mariel (Kari Matchett), a local doctor.  Her ex-husband Russell Varon (Eddie Cibrian), their kids Rose and Jessie(Ariel Gade and Evan Peters), Russell's new wife Larkin (Lisa Sheridan), her brother Dave (Tyler Labine), and Tom's daughter Kira (Alexis Dziena).  Without spoiling anything, one of the main characters is already changed before the series starts, and another quickly thereafter, along with an increasing large swath of the town.  Essentially the show is about how the core characters react to the changes and the ramping up of the alien presence.  Again, I can believe that the network would finance a pilot, and pick it up.

But from then on, the show veers off in a slew of directions, seemingly in random ways.  Characters are allies one second, enemies the next, and then allies again.  The Mariel and Russell characters, who appear to have been divorced for about five years, go all over the place with each other, while the predictable tension between Tom and Russell gets turned off and on like a light switch, depending on the need of the plot.  I'm sure the writers would correct me on this if they read it, but they literally seemed to be making up the plot from week to week, and on a show like this, that's not really a good plan.  Also, the pace was kind of slow, as in the first half of the season not a whole lot happened.  You can get away with this on the CW or cable, where ratings don't need to be quite as high, but Cassidy and company should have known better given that ABC was involved.

The acting was........inconsistent at best, but never truly bad or unwatchable.  Fichtner was his usual self, dependable and reliable.  I first saw him on As the World Turns, so I'm sure he was used to his character shifting around like crazy, and it didn't seem to faze him.  Eddie Cibrian does not fare so well, as they wanted to make him the action hero of the story, only with dramatic moments, and he just couldn't pull it off.  He did the requisite stupid things that any action hero is forced to do, but rarely ever had to pay for his mistakes.  The wives were better off, kind of, but all too often were given the cliched roles of the worried wives who just want their hubbies to be home for their families.  I did like how Matchett and Sheridan interacted with the kids though, a definite strength.  Tyler Labine played a softer version of the Sock character he would later play on Reaper, so this was a nice warmup for him.  Dave was a alien conspiracy nut before this, so these events were seemingly right in his wheelhouse, but he also was a great uncle to his step-nieces and nephew, and could be counted on.  The kids were a strange lot, the little girl Rose got the best lines and scenes of the three, while Evan Peters seemed to have one facial expression only, but it must have been what they wanted, as they gave his character more to do as the season went on.  The Kira character started off as the typical pretty girl type, but of course evolved, though not unbelievably.  Only Labine really got a bounce from the show, career-wise, though Fichtner didn't need one.

The ending was one that indicated that the producers/writers either didn't know that the show was on the chopping block, or didn't care.  A lot of threads are hanging there, including a life or death moment........but they exist to be tied off in our minds, as ABC wouldn't do it for us.

Is this show worth your money?  For less than $10, absolutely.  For much more, it depends on your disposable income I suppose.  Just go into this series with the knowledge that there's an end, but no conclusion.

Three stars because of William Fichtner and Lisa Sheridan (for her incredible episode of The Mentalist).",1311984000,2,4902,4.5873563218390805

Invasion's sci/fi plot drew me to watch but the characters are what kept me viewing to the end of the single season. They ranged from the sympathetic to the creepily suspect to the outright malevolent but all were well developed and acted.

I found myself worried less by not knowing exactly what the invaders were and what they meant for mankind as a whole than by desiring to know how the sheriff's last action would affect the relationship with his family and the partnership of necessity he had forged with the ranger in their attempt to protect their loved ones.

2579023,3,B000FOPPBA,"Conclusion: My love for science fiction television leads me to some strange places.  What's that you say? Reports are supposed to start with a hypothesis and end with a conclusion?  Well in my defense, since the creators of Invasion weren't troubled with ending the series with any sort of conclusion, who says I should play by the rules in reviewing it?

Okay that's a little harsh considering the reason Invasion never properly ends is that when the first (and only) season concluded, viewer ratings weren't strong enough to justify creation of a second season.  So it's got to be bad right? Well not really.  In fact of all the science fiction Lost can take credit for popularizing, (a list that includes Surface, Taken, Threshold, the 4400, Defying Gravity and so on) Invasion is actually one of the stronger entries.

The story goes like this: During a hurricane that hits Florida, a bunch of strange lights emerge from the ocean. Several people go missing, only to wind up the following morning near the water, completely naked and with no memory of how they survived. Immediately following the bizarre phenomenon, the people of the small town of Homestead begin slowly transforming into hybrids presumably in connection with the orange lights and weird fish-like monsters that are showing up washed ashore in pieces and bits of flesh.

Add a jovial but quickly dismissed unemployed blogger with a penchant for conspiracy theories, a creepy town sheriff, a few hormonally charged teens, the military and more schemes than the proverbial super-villain's underground lair and the formula is complete.

Eventually it's accepted that the small Floridian town is the beachhead for an impending invasion of creatures, possibly extraterrestrial, that abduct people in the water and make perfect hybrid copies of them, with the possible purpose being to either offer the next step in evolution or extinction.

The format is one fans of Lost will already know quite well: each 48-minute episode introduces new mysteries, answers a question or two but always ends on a cliffhanger.  Unlike Lost however, Invasion doesn't bury its viewers in new mysteries far more often than it solves old ones.  In fact, despite a few twists and turns, the plot of Invasion is surprisingly focused and coherent for this genre.

The plot does tend to lean more heavily on the type of science fiction we associate with X-Files over say Star Trek and there's little doubt that the pacing most closely resembles that of a soap opera than a typical prime-time drama.

So what we have here is essentially a horror-laced serial that runs 21-episodes without a definitive conclusion.  Besides, for a premise centered on an alien invasion, there really isn't much alien or invasion to be found here, rather innuendo, hypothesis and conspiracy theories.  Even still it's pretty safe to say the DVD box set is a worthy investment, especially during the winter months.  For one thing it can eat up a massive chunk of time- nearly 20-hours in fact (spread across 6 discs).  Secondly, while by no means revolutionary, the premise and delivery are strong enough to catch and hold most viewers' attention.  Finally those disappointed with the phenomenon that was Lost (a demographic that includes yours truly), Invasion offers a pretty intriguing alternative that isn't nearly as muddled or implausible.

Of course when this set was initially released, the MSRP was a staggering $59.99.  At that price point, your money could definitely be better spent elsewhere however these days it seems the entire set can be picked up for under ten-bucks.  907-minutes of mystery/ action coupled to special features including: Missing scenes, ""Invading the Mind of Shaun Cassidy"" featurette & a gag reel, you really can't complain.

Unfortunately, it was hamstrung by a weak cast and erratic writing.

However, the cast when strong, is very strong.  Tom and Dave save the show for me, especially Tom.  The more I learn about the character, the more interesting he becomes.  Get Invasion to watch Tom.  The deputy Lewis is also engaging.  One of the more sympathetic characters.  Elisabeh Moss has her best role in Invasion - Mad Men or not. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters just don't measure up.

The basic ideas are very good.  The writers just don't seem capable of pulling it off consistently.

The show does end with a cliffhanger.  However, as I can't stand that character, it didn't really bother me.

2579038,5,B000FOPPBA,"2005 was a bittersweet year for me regarding new television shows.  2005 produced four of my all-time favorite shows: Invasion, Surface, Threshold and Prison Break.  Unfortunately, all but Prison Break lasted only one season and it's a crying shame.  Earlier this week I finished watching Invasion for the third time and it gets better with every viewing, as I always pick up new details.  With this last viewing, I finally understand the deeper meaning of the show.  Many people may think the show is about an alien invasion, but it's not.  While there is that aspect of it, it's actually about evolution and the prolonging of the human race.  Aside from the show being extremely well written, the acting is what engages the viewer to connect with the show.  You care about them and almost get lost in everything they're saying because it feels so real.

I once read that Invasion was supposed to run for five seasons.  It's sad to think that we only got about 20% of what Shaun Cassidy and crew wanted us to, but it is what it is.  I wonder what would have happened in the second season just for the fact that the end of season one (and the series) left us with such a huge cliffhanger.  It was almost as huge as the cliffhanger ending to Surface.  Speaking of the cliffhanger ending, I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed with the Invading the Mind of Shaun Cassidy special feature because they did not go into detail about the ending or what the audience could expect in following seasons, unlike the Threshold special features which told you what you could have expected.

Nonetheless while not playing in the same league as either of the two ""body"" snatcher films or the better of their descendants, Invasion is a watchable vehicle which suffers from the ability to watch episodes in swift succession rather than separated by a week. Weakness in plot lines and fuzzy characterizations are more visible than they would be in the original.
I would commend the series DVD to those not seeking on the edge of the seat suspense and sharply etched horror.

It all seems like a conspiracy theory until a plane is found, a pilot's body is recovered, and something else in also picked up amongst some wreckage. Then everything starts getting really bizarre.

If I had a series that I could have seen continue, it would have been this one. I loved the things this series was doing, from the little pieces that were going into play to the bigger things that were being shifted around. We saw the army in this and we saw people changing, but we had no idea why.

My favorite shows are Dexter, The Wire, Battlestar Galactica and Rockford Files (when David Chase writes them) - so that's where I'm coming from. I would put this right up there with them. The narrative is strong and is full of twists and turns. It also keeps moving. I agree with the slow start, but there is very little fat on this. Unlike Lost, which is full of gratuitious story telling to chew up episodes, this never loses its way. I found myself even becoming disturbed by it - which says a lot.

Having read a lot into the Cambrian period and various theories on evolutionary ""jumps,"" I thought they handled the whole back story with incredible deftness. My only objection was that an evolutionary superior species would be more spiritually or rationally endowed instead of just physically so. The writers behind Invasion seem to be suggesting the contrary - that these ""aliens"" are an invasive specie with no soul, and are only restrained by their ""human"" half in the case where this human half is strong enough to resist the pull of the aliens. So the hybrids who's human halfs possess a strong moral or religious center (like the priest and the deputy or the Doctor) are more capable of resisting the evil the aliens unleash. This is the part I found disturbing because it really does suggest that advances in evolution need not be advances in spirituality, etc., which basically means the human racce is screwed. It's a very cynical, Darwinian outlook, but also one that is very plausible. After all, the humans eradicated the Neanderthals, which many archaeologist believe was a much gentler, more cooperative specie than the humanoid. So... why not?

2579080,3,B000FOPPBA,"I came across this series in the local library. I do not recall it being on television...probably because it lasted but one season.
There were a lot of sub-plots that were left hanging, that I was forced to wonder if they may have gone somewhere if the series had been continued beyond one season.

Basically the show is built on the idea that alien life forms have invaded the human species in the form of glowing, orange sting-rays that come down in massive shooting-star like fashion during hurricanes. These glowing sting-rays have invaded the small town of Homestead Florida, totally disrupting one dysfunctional family made up of the Sheriff (Tom), his doctor wife (Mariel), the doctor wife's x-husband/park ranger (Russ), his new wife/news reporter (Larkin), her blog-writing brother (Dave), and three children belonging to the couples (Kira, Jesse, Rose). These people seem to be the only ones aware that glowing orange sting-rays have taken over the bodies of town-members.

There are some really annoying reminders thrown in every other scene or so, as if we may have forgotten that Larkin is pregnant. Her character feels the need to blurt it out in turret's style fashion every few phrases or so, ""I'm a pregnant woman!"". All throughout the season there are blatant hints that the ""offspring"" of the EBE's (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities...which is a phrase I'm afraid will never replace the simple ""E.T.s"" of Speilberg's brain) are the REAL THREAT to the human race....by the way, the series ends before we ever meet the off spring of said EBE's.

Despite the little annoyances of sub-plots gone no where, the series was just beginning to take shape and start to get really interesting when it was cancelled at the end of season 1....with a huge cliff-hanger to leave those of us who are some-what twisted and occult-like in our enjoyment of the absurd, feeling betrayed and confused, when Larkin, our ""I'm a pregnant woman!""-shouting supporting actress is tossed into the water for the glowing sting-rays to do with as they deem appropriate. We'll never know if she became a ""hybrid"" (which the show took the time to remind us in one episode, is NOT the car, but the combination of glowing sting-rays and human DNA) or if she was spit back onto land...and what happened to the baby she was carrying that had become the subject of constant reminders throughout the entire series, at least 6 times each episode? And what happened to the ""litter"" of offspring the hybrid women were apparently carrying....and I'm sure the series was leading toward the idea of a hybrid (Lewis) becoming sexually involved with young Kira at some point.
The main focus of the series was the offspring, yet we'll never know whether they're taking over the world as we know it or not.

I was surprised at the quality of just about everything in this show. You know they're doing something right when they take a silly premise with some ludicrous plot points and transform it into an engrossing drama.

You may not even have to like science fiction to like this. It's just good drama... and I don't even enjoy TV! I haven't watched in 20 years but I've found a few great series on DVD. This is one of them. What a shame it fell through the cracks.

If you like a well-spun science-fiction yarn with a lot of characters, then ""Invasion"" is probably a show you should check out.  Bear in mind, however, that the ""series"" is 22 episodes long (i.e. one TV season) and that you'll be both intrigued and dissatisfied at the end of episode 22 because that's it, no more ""Invasion.""

Although ""Invasion"" generally has great special effects, there's an episode where the park ranger (Russell) and his brother-in-law (Dave) infiltrate the aliens' island hideaway.  At some point, they get their mitts on a radio and call in the Coast Guard.  What ensues is one of the most surrealistic (i.e. fake-looking) scenes I've had the displeasure of witnessing in a recent TV show, particularly in one where the effects are usually great.  There's also another scene where an alien claws a dead body off the beach.  The alien looks fine, the beach looks fine, the dead body looks fine, the water looks fine, but the mixture of them is poor.  The problem with these scenes seems to stem from a bright-blue white-cloud background, a watery midground and a sandy foreground, the last of which usually has a human being or two in it.  For the aforementioned effects, I removed half a star from what is an otherwise five-star effort in episodic TV.

Definitely worth a look for the science-fiction fan.",1252368000,,2042,5.979381443298969

2579091,5,B000FOPPBA,"I rarely watch episodic, network television, so I completely missed this series during the year that it ran. I just happened to catch the first episode during an ""Invasion"" marathon that aired this week (6/09) on satellite television, and I was immediately hooked. After a while, I found myself sitting through the painful 5 to 7 minute commercial breaks, just to make sure I didn't miss anything. (No doubt, the series is infinitely more enjoyable on DVD, without the endless commercials). I can see where some would feel that the earlier episodes were slower paced, but the last half dozen shows more than made up for that. Each episode had an unexpected turn, and the characters were beautifully and consistently defined. The Tom Underlay character, played by an excellent William Fichtner, was a constant question mark, and you could never be sure of his motives until the last couple of episodes. In concept, it was like a 'hybrid' of ""Alien"" and ""Invasion of the Bodysnatchers."" It is such a shame that ABC chose to sabotage the original series by putting it on hiatus and failing to air re-runs to keep the audience interested. Then, of course, Hurricane Katrina didn't help matters because it caused ABC to pull back on promoting the show aggressively. To be clear, this was a television series, so it didn't have feature film production values. Even so, the effects were remarkably good, and the performances were all first rate, right down to Ariel Gade, who played the little girl named ""Rose"". Her 'realness' reminded me a lot of Dakota Fanning. With as little science fiction as there is on network television, it is all the more disappointing that ""Invasion"" wasn't given a fair chance.",1244851200,,1700,4.90625

In fact, since watching this, it's been hard to get into any other series. Fear seems to be the big draw these days; the politicians in Washington sure learned that lesson quickly. An alien invasion is too much like fiction; better to create a series about  a world taken over by extremists or a specific category of people to hate. When emotions are exploited there is little need for good writing or decent acting. Invasion was full of surprises and demonstrated that people are a lot more complex than they first appear. It said a lot about what makes a family, what qualities make us human, and that tolerance is a key to survival. All very timely themes in our day.

2579127,2,B000FOPPBA,"This series has an incredibly stupid plot. It's not that I'm against aliens replicating people (as in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" but the reactions of the key humans in this sci-fi drama.

Russell Varon (Eddie Cibrian) seems very unconcerned that his ex-wife was killed and replaced telling Dr. Mariel Underlay (Kari Matchett) that she's still the mother of their children. She's not. The mother was killed and replaced. He knows this. He acts as if she's just 'different'.

Only his son gets to state this on the 5th disc. He says she's not his mom, and she was murdered.

I can't understand how everyone who knows this is so calm about the 'new' beings and seeing if they can work out some kind of compromise.

The family at the centre of this are faced with threats. The uncle goes to the school to pick up his neice but the teacher won't let the kid out until the lesson is over. The uncle just sits down in class and waits until recess, even though the child's in danger. This was sooo anoyingly dumb.

2579129,5,B000FOPPBA,"""Invasion"", quite simply, is the best science fiction show ever created. Yes, even better than ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Firefly"", or for those of you from the 1980s, ""V"". The only downside is that this show was not renewed for a second season, which is a pity, considering just how excellent the first season was.

This DVD set contains all the Episodes from the First and only Season of ""Invasion"". You probably know the story already - but this is very, very different from any of the ""Body Snatchers"" themes you might have come across. In this version, lights from the sky fall down into the waterbodies in Southwest Florida, and anyone who steps near the water is 'reborn' as a biologically varied clone. Yes, there ARE aliens here, but they look more like squid. However, considering they come from another planet, their origins or intents are never properly explained. The end of the first season is a shocker - a primary characters' destiny is altered, and it is hinted that the Invasion by the Aliens is being supported by the Government itself.

Thrown in a very good looking and talented cast, and you have a winner. Eddie Cibrian plays the lead role here, as a Park Ranger who has to deal with the madness around him, and protect his children and fiancee at the same time. The show is heavy on family drama, yet not for one second does it forget its a science fiction show. An equal dose of melodrama and sci-fi mystery are presented in every episode. What I found very surprising is how re-watchable every episode is. Replay Value ranks very highly when I make a DVD Purchase, so its a mercy to find that every episode of ""Invasion"" is worth watching again. Sorry, ""Firefly"" fans, I can't say the same for that series.

What I liked about ""Invasion"", was also the fact that it never once teetered on ridiculous. A show of this sort could be so 'out there', that you might start disconnecting from the lead characters. Everyone here was so human and normal - and the child actors did a fantastic job in their roles. A coherent storyline marks every episode, and even though every episode is long (sometimes more than an hour a-piece), it is never boring.

Watching this a few years post-cancellation, its evident this was a rare TV Show that was WAY ahead of its' time. Most people don't 'get' the show or the reason for its' cult success. I would say - trust your instincts and get this as a blind buy. You'll be thanking me for years to come.

When you get a great plot that keeps adjusting to the betterment of the story why do the TV programers put on some junk in its place.

The characters of Invasion were slowly growing - the family traumas were adjusting - in the last featurette the whole thing was about FAMILY.
I loved the lights - the suspense of learning what the creature was - the sense of community - the revelations of the sheriff, Tom Underlay [and no one seemed to make the connection with the date on the ring] and his growth as a caring character who wanted to save everyone.

Dave threw in a bit of comic relief - while little Rose and Kiera irritated me.  Wonderful cast. Yup! I knew that it would not end the way I would have wanted but the whole set of discs was worth it.

I highly recommend this DVD to all sci-fi fans, anyway.  Once past all the intertwined family messes and soap-opera-like chatter amongst the characters, the plot is fascinatingly involving.  An alien invasion through stealthy integration and seemingly no way to stop it.  Major cool!

2579142,5,B000FOPPBA,"I bought this series a week and a half ago and I've watched over half of it already.  Most of the time when I have watched TV shows that only lasted a year I can figure out why by the 4th or 5th episode.  In fact, there are some series I have watched and sold them without even finishing them because I became ""disinterested.""  This show gets better with every episode.  It keeps you guessing and throws in curves in almost every episode.  It reminds me, in ways of the X-Files mythology shows but I find it much more intense than even that series that lasted 9 seasons.  It has similarities to movies like the Body Snatchers and War of the Worlds but it is unique in its concept and not just a copy of somebody else's ideas.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this ""gotta-keep-watching it"" series lasted only 1 season.  The only thing I can think is that it wasn't marketed affectively.  With its time slot it should have been a ""can't miss.""  The Sci-Fi Channell would do well to pick this up where it left off and continue it.  If the story lines stayed this good it would do as well as other series picked up by Sci Fi like Stargate and Battlestar Galactica.  In my opinion, if like Sci Fi and alien take over type stories you will thoroughly enjoy this 22 episode ""mini-series"" that begs to be continued.  RJF",1175644800,5,1323,4.3076923076923075
2579143,2,B000FOPPBA,"Just finished watching this series.  It wasn't bad.  I would have given it 3 1/2 to 4 stars.  Some weak premises and characters are a little one dimensional.  But the basic storyline was good.

But, unfortunately, the series gets cancelled on a cliffhanger without ANY resolution whatsoever.  Had I known that, I wouldn't bothered even starting to watch this show.

I don't think these production companies should be rewarded for not finishing their products.  If they wanted to sell this, they should have finished it.  At least have written in an ending.

Think about it, would you buy a book if it had no final chapter, even if it was REALLY good up to that point?  I think all these reviewers saying that by selling a lot of DVDs they might bring the series back are mistaken.  That never happens.  Only with ""Family Guy"" and that was only because it's animated.  Otherwise, actors get different jobs, kids grow up.  You can't skip 2 years in a series and just come back to it.

Anyway, unless you can stand being drawn into a storyline only to be left hanging, go elsewhere for your entertainment.",1174348800,7,1102,4.632124352331606

I refuse to reward these stuupid execs for canceling shows right when they're getting good. I'm another person who doesn't have time to watch shows when they're in production, and only get to see them once they come out on DVD.

These TV execs need to realize that large part of the potential audience they are alienating when they cancel these shows prematurely.

For a while there were rumors it was going to be picked up for a second season by the Sci-Fi Channel, but that never came to pass, so viewers got a one-season series with a cliffhanger finale that lets you write your own conclusion.  Based in sci-fi, its more than just a sci-fi series - its one about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  Actually, you feel strongly - at least I did - for the alien hybrids - maybe even more so than for the ones who have been untouched by the aliens.  William Fichtner is superb as Sheriff Tom Underlay the first of the human alien hybrids and that's all I'm going to say.

2579148,5,B000FOPPBA,"This series grabbed my interest, and I could not stop watching it.  I've been too busy with college courses, work, and reading for my Degree path to enjoy much entertainment.  However, during Xmas Break, I experienced the first DVD in the ""Invasion"" series, and I was completely hooked.  I had to watch the entire series while I had the opportunity, then I also purchased the complete set.

This is not just a Sci-Fi, action-packed, well-made and gripping story, but this is also a perfect series for anyone who has experienced alternative family situations.  The interplay between lovers and ex-lovers, the bonding and issues experienced by the children, and other basic daily family issues play out in a believable, realistic manner throughout the series.  As someone who has experienced even more complex family combining situations, and ex-lover becomes new lover's friend type of scenarios, I thoroughly grasped the stories within the story.  I believe this series is a realistic portrayal of modern relationships (with an Alien twist).

As a long time X-Files fan, and a person who enjoys good Sci-Fi, I truly enjoyed and recommend this series.  I purchased this ASAP to add to my movie collection.  I've never seen anything quite like the ""Invasion"" series, but this conjured-up memories of X-Files, The Outer Limits, The Twilight Zone, and other great Sci-Fi series; yet ""Invasion"" is very modern and contemporary, with current social commentary.

In a post-Katrina U.S., this series has tapped into the underlying worries of Global Warming, government issues, ""Conspiracy Theory"" and a host of other issues.  Basically, this series has something for everyone.

I also recommend ""Invasion"" for people who are not interested in Sci-Fi, or the above genres, yet have experienced divorce, separation, the joining of families, and other modern (common) societal changes.  This would be an excellent series to purchase for teenagers who are experiencing parental divorce, ""see it isn't that bad...it could be worse...your step-mom could be an Alien!""",1170979200,3,2053,5.296296296296297
2579149,2,B000FOPPBA,"About five episodes into INVASION, it became obvious that the writers were making it up as they went along.  The role of the sheriff changed slightly, from more insidious to someone more sympathetic.  To me, this suggests that the enemy wasn't clearly outlined in producer Shaun Cassidy's imagination.  He had a PREMISE -- that something was taking over a Florida town, and that it had something to do with water, and that the government might have something to do with it -- but it was just a list of intriguing, atmospheric SOMETHINGS, with no fully visualized outcome.  By the end, not even Cassidy knew what or who the invader was, and he was hoping these essential details to be revealed to him during some flash of inspiration.  The constant dragging out of revelations -- and none of them decidedly revelatory -- added to the notion that Cassidy was stalling for the epiphany that never came.  Instead he settled for inserting ANYTHING into the mix, one creepy thing after the other, forever suggesting possibilities to keep interest in his premise alive, and seemingly never looking back at what had previously occurred.  Development was exchanged for a procession of dalliances and deadends.  By the season finale, nothing about anything was revealed.  Not even the sheriff knew anymore who or what he was.

Cassidy did the same thing with AMERICAN GOTHIC, which fizzled instead of ending, and the final episode was hastily thrown together without resolution.  When I learned during the pilot episode for INVASION that Cassidy was producer and creative mind behind it, I was only mildly disappointed; MILDLY because what worked in AMERICAN GOTHIC worked so well, Cassidy could be forgiven for what might have been beyond his control.  But he's done this twice now, bespeaking more of HIS limitations and lack of respect for his audience.  The man can put forth a great idea, but he is unable to see it to its conclusion.  Perhaps he  should be advised that the first step is to lay out the entire premise.  Not an episode-per-episode plot synopsis, but at least a strong outline from which the team of writers can not stray.  Never lose sight of the inevitable, that ALL series must come to an end.  When the axe comes, the finale will be ready to go, putting the series to rest with an honest conclusion.  Then when it's over, Cassidy can repackage it all as a completed series, perhaps for years to come, perhaps to an ever expanding audience; instead of the finale reflecting a lazy effort that treated the audience as rubes, exploiting their expectations without ever delivering.  Never again, Mr. Cassidy.  Never again.  Fool me once (and so on).",1168732800,10,2660,4.864444444444445

It had me hooked from the first disc, and I watched all six in 2 days.  My husband and brother even got into it.  One problem that curses many TV shows in the sci fi genre is horrible or just cheesy acting.  Invasion was fortunate enough to have a convincing cast, that really got into their parts.

In this day and age, with TIVO and DVR and even DVDs, it is unfair to base a show's popularity only on Neilson ratings.  They are far from accurate and result in the ending of very inventive and exciting series....such as Invasion.  What a pity.  And it is especially sad when you notice that there are a bazillion CSI's out there and a gazillion Law and Orders, and tons and tons of shows that repeat the same formula, and they have been on the air for years!

The script never seems to develop, while the actors seem to struggle with characters that border on the one dimensonal.

It does have promise as an idea but runs out of steam in the script department. More suited to a mini series that has an end.

Not that I am a friend of TV execs but I can see why this was canned after the first series.

Here, we see a young soon to be mum (The girlfriend of the main hero character) constantly bordering on hysterical and behaving in a completely irrasional manner way too much of the time! It's always the women...! Also, I am furious at the producers for not supplying subtitles in English on the DVD. How cheap, lazy and unthoughtful of you! I buy DVD's because I am hard of hearing and need subtitles to help me with the dialogue I miss, due to loud overdubbed music, whispering or faces being turned away from camera. They have no excuse not to have included English for the hearing impaired! It should be required by all DVD producers to include subtitles of the language spoken. I hope a producer reads this and hangs their greedy head in shame. After all, it can only be because of saving money that they didn't include them?

2579169,4,B000FOPPBA,"I cannot recommend this series more highly. ""Invasion"" was a breakthrough series- great drama, terrific full-blooded characters, suspense, imagination, emotion and humor. It was also sci-fi, and apparently that was its doom. Too many viewers assumed that a sci-fi series would be tacky and never even gave it a try. They were so wrong. This particular sci-fi story did not involve Klingons and ""Beam me up, Scotty."" It's more like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" where you are dealing with human beings only, but humans who begin to change. The pace and suspense of the story are fantastic. What's most frustrating is that the cancellation of the series meant there was essentially no ending- it ran a full season, stopped on a cliffhanger episode and then never came back. So go into it knowing that. The writing for this series and the casting end up with some of the most compelling characters I've ever seen in a show. The little girl Rose is irresistible and never hackneyed. You can't take your eyes off the blond doctor heroine (whose name I've forgotten- sorry)- she's fascinating and beautiful. Her brother is an oddball unemployed beer guy- very funny and you attach to him instantly. Her husband Tom is probably one of the best ""villains"" I've ever seen because you keep changing your mind about him- Is he good? Is he bad? Is he both?! Can he be trusted? The sci-fi aspect involves lights that fall into the water during a terrible hurricane. Anyone who goes into the water after that is ""infected"" by these lit-up entities. People still look the same, most act basically the same, but they are only carbon copies of their real selves which perished in the water. They've been taken over by the entities. Anyway, I think it's impossible not to be gripped by this series and not to be really angry at the producers who decided to kill it.

2579187,5,B000FOPPBA,"Mr. Shaun Cassidy (""American Gothic"") proves again his talent in screen writing and production.  INVASION provided an awesome soap opera serial without the soap or the opera.  Grounded in the fantasy of our imagination, it presented a plausible and intelligent script anchored by good actors and supported by an excellent production team.  INVASION was one of the reason why television was invented: entertainment.

  The premise is well worn-a twist of ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".  Nevertheless, it is the twist Mr. Cassidy provides that makes the show addictive.  However, the writing combined with a strong cast anchored by William Fichtner (The Sheriff), Eddie Cibrian (Russell), Kari Matchett (Mariel), Lisa Sheridan (Lisa), and Tyler Labine (Dave) take it a step above your average first season series.  An equally strong secondary cast with Evan Peters (Jesse), Ariel Gade (Rose), Alexis Dziena (Kira), Aisha Hinds (Mona Gomez) round out this amazing group.  Note: If you are wondering, yes--Alexis Dziena did portray the Lolita character in ""Broken Flowers"" and Bonnie in ""Joan of Arcadia"".

  So if you have looking to divest yourself of some money for quality television, than I suggest INVASION, but be warned of the series finale and it's cancellation.  Though a sad reflection of how series gets picked by executives and not the people; it was definately one of the better television series of the 2005/2006 season and worth a few dollars, pounds, euros, yen, etc.",1162425600,3,1487,5.245762711864407

O.K., I'm begging Mr. Cassidy, write some more for a future series. Each episode is brilliantly written with the perfect amount of tension/drama and very believable dialogue and characters. I especially enjoyed William Fichtner's outstanding performance of Sheriff Underlay. I'm going to look for William's name in future movie picks.

  This series also nudged me to think deeper about evolution, UFO theories, and other deep mysteries of our world. It's an excellent example of great writing and directing, but you'll be starving for more at the end. Who do we call to bring it back???

Hi..
I just finished watching invasion a few days back, i saw the show on DVD, and to tell the truth i was expecting an excellent series after reading all those positive reviews, but i was quite dissapointed with it, it wasn't good at all, in fact most episodes were boring.
No wonder it has been canceled, because it had no potential of getting any better soon and was really really boring and unoriginal.

* some spoilers*
First of all, i thought the whole idea of the show was unoriginal and we've seen this idea in many many movies and tv shows ( examples include invasion of the body snatchers and the faculty ) actually it was very very similar to the movie the faculty, same idea with the whole aliens and thier preference to water !
The episodes were very slowly progressing, at many times boring, nothing really happens ! one episode, someone falls into the water, he comes back changed, people are uncomfortable with that change. THEN, next episode another person falls in the water, comes back and the cycle continues, nothing new really happens in the first few episodes.
The final episodes weren't that good either and very predictable, actually the whole show was predictable, i mean i knew where it was going from the start, ( people changing and being taken over by aliens, more and more join in and eventually aliens want to take over the world, hmmmmmm, i didn't see that coming ?! )

Im not sure why fans like this show and keep asking for it to come back, if it were for me i wouldn't watch a second season of this show, and im glad there isn't another season, because it really sucked !
There are several other shows that are far more superior to this boring show, ( examples include : x-files, millennium, miracles, 24, lost and battlestar galagtica )
Actually, im very dissapointed in wasting my money on this show, if you haven't seen this, my advice is don't buy it and save your money, because it is not worth it .
I gave it one star because of some good acting by some, and good sepcial effects, but overall, it is a failure.",1159401600,9,2133,4.685333333333333
2579193,5,B000FOPPBA,"I agree with the other reviewers, it seems like Sci-Fi programs such as Invasion and Surface never had the backing from the networks. ABC Execs should learn the difference between a series finale and a season finale. Give the viewers some closure, but no....back to stupid reality series.

It starts almost drearily slow, and almost lost me in the first few episodes, but I stuck with it. There is a level of depth and complexity to the writing that's worth waiting for and once it becomes clear whats going on, all the dreary slowness clears away. All of the episodes flow together seemlessly.

What I found most amusing is Dave, the alien conspiracy nut, who is the only one who really sees what's going on for what it is - and eventually even he concedes that the 'pod people' seem pretty normal. The female characters in the series are generally inane and annoying with an addiction to overacting and an aversion to following directions, but generally the cast does a good job in helping us suspend disbelief.

However, had I fully realized what a collosal tease this show would end up being, I probably wouldn't have watched it. With no hope to resolving the series, I'm left feeling like I wasted a lot of time and emotional involvement.

At the very least, they should have filmed one more episode and given us somewhat of a resolution.  Instead, they left us wondering ... what happened?

  I spent a lot of time watching this series and got no payoff.  The title of this product is false advertising.  Invasion-The Complete Series.  A complete series (attention ABC) has a beginning and an end.  Invasion has a beginning and a middle.

  Warning to buyers!  I wasted a year watching this show.  If you buy this series, you will be wasting both your time and hard-earned $$$.

Shaun Cassidy is to be given credit for trying to take a singular plot line and extend it over 22 episodes, but that one plot line vacillated too much and the writers couldn't overcome the plot's limitations.

During a Hurricane (Eve), something strange happens:  mysterious orange lights are seen falling into the waters in southern Florida's everglades area.  After the storm is over, some of the residents are acting rather peculiarly.  We learn soon tha extraterrestrial beings have ""taken over"" the bodies of some of the townsfolk, creating ""hybrid"" human/alien life forms.  We also learn that Sheriff Tom Underlay is one of these hybrids and he is trying to control the new species..for what purpose we don't know for a long time into the series.

WHAT WERE THE ""CHANGES"" THE HYBRIDS EXPERIENCED?  Other than the fact that they can stay submerged under water for a long time (evidenced by the countless scenes of Mariel in her bathtub), and some possible other ""super powers' never fully explained, what were these changes?  That's at least for the ""good"" hybrids; but what about the ""bad"" ones, as evidenced in the sociopathic behavior of Christina, who abandons her baby, and then kills her mother in law, and sex-starved Derek, who ends up being Clyde to her Bonnie?  And what about the churchgoers who nearly beat a man to death who has come to pick up his wife after one of their ""survivor"" meetings, or the priest who turns to the gun for retribution?

Writers also tried to turn initially villainous Tom into an almost beatified savior of sorts, most blatantly evidenced by Tom's actions in the last episode.  Tom's character obviously is one who wants control and expects every one to feel the way he does about the ""changes"".  On focusing on mainly the two families, we got repeat doses of Jesse's surliness and Rose's cuteness, and how Russell tries to juggle his two wives in order to protect the kids.  Involving more people might have made the series feel more vibrant and involving.  After a while, all the bickering between the two couples made me feel like I was watching DALLAS.  The decision to cancel the series without a wrap up episode is unforgivable.  For those fans who devotedly followed the series, they should be given at least a special tv movie or something to tie things together.

INVASION looked good, with some nice camerawork and editing, and the performances were sharp:  William Fichtner brought a Clint Eastwood flintiness to his role as Tom; Kari Matchett did well as the hybrid Mariel, trying to be both a mother and wife in spite of her changes; Eddie Cibrian as Russell was heroically stalwart although as the series progressed, his character became more of an action hero type than a real character; Lisa Sheridan was effective as Russell's pregnant wife Lauren and Ariel Gade's Rose was realistically cute.  I didn't care much for Tyler Labine's turn as alien-nut Dave; nor Evan Peters' Jess who seemed too one dimensional.  I had mixed reservations about Alexis Dzeina's Kiera and James Frain's SZUKA.  They had good and bad moments.

All in all, INVASION seems to be a good idea but ultimately it caved it on itself, losing its momentum and trying too hard to be a family oriented soap.  The theme of co-existence between different species is difficult to swallow when the other beings forced themselves onto unwitting victims.",1157155200,3,3703,4.873801916932908

The reason I will NOT be purchasing this DVD set is this is not the complete series.  This is one season, without resolution.  I already know what happened, I want to know what happens next.  This is like purchasing half of a book.

IF this is picked up by another channel, I WILL watch and purchase.  Until then, my money is better spent elsewhere.  My rating is for the series (actors, producers, directors, etc.), not this DVD collection.",1156636800,12,674,4.450819672131147
2579209,5,B000FOPPBA,"I've been a science fiction fan for 45 years. I was really excited with the 2005/2006 TV season because Lost was in its second season and we were given a new progam with Invasion.

The ABC Affiliate in San Diego let 50 people see the season opener at a private screening before it was on TV. They actually had more hurricane in it originally but they toned it down before the season premier due to Katrina. I was one of the people there for that screening. I think the reason they had that screening was to get reaction to the program. Invasion had been written before Katrina and had the misfortune of falling after Katrina. We made suggestions that maybe if they toned down the hurricane and put a warning message on before the season premiere started, people would be okay with it. ABC followed those suggestions.

Even with Invasion's original opening at that screening, I could hardly wait for the season opener. But ABC frustrated me because after a few weeks they showed reruns then new episodes and then reruns and then a new episode, etc. Then they put it in hiatus for a stupid program. They finally brought it back and ended the season with a 'Season Finale' that left us wanting the second season to start so we could see what happened. They were too cowardly to let us know it was really the series finale. Invasion was a good program and I'm not happy it won't have a second season.

ABC and NBC both disappoint me. All they want is the fast buck and they don't care about the rest of us. All they want to do is put more 'Reality' TV on and more silly sitcomes. 'Reality' TV that is nothing more than stupid. What about us Science Fiction fans. Don't we deserve good programming too?

Surface, Lost and Invasion were really the only decent programs on. Even NBC copped out with a Series Finale calling it a Season Finale for Surface. I made sure I was home every Monday night for Surface and ever Wednesday night for Lost and Invasion. Those were the only two nights of the week that had on really good TV.

The networks lost me years ago with all their crummy programming. Lost, Invasion and Surface brought me back. Losing Surface and Invasion will lose me again. I won't be watching anything other than Lost if NBC doesn't bring back Surface and ABC doesn't bring back Invasion.

I am really disappointed with both NBC and ABC for not giving either Surface or Invasion a chance to succeed. Both were good programs but all NBC and ABC care about is the fast buck. They don't care if they leave unhappy people out here when they cancel decent programs for more stupid Reality programs and more silly sitcoms. I should have expected it though because NBC and ABC have being doing this to us for years. Shame on you, NBC and ABC!!",1156636800,16,2743,4.476
2579210,5,B000FOPPBA,"I'm a 32 year old housewife and probably don't fit the norm for this type of genre, but I have to say this was a fabulous scif-fi show! I anxiously awaited a new episode every week.  It tortured me when the show went on hiatus during this past December.

The storyline is definitely interesting and, unfortunately due to cancellation by ABC, wasn't developed quickly enough.  The season finale (.....ooops, series finale) leaves you with a fantastic cliffhanger.

I certainly hope that the ""powers that be"", recognize what a great show and story this was and finish it out for us!  This show was too great to just dump and run!",1156377600,11,627,4.663636363636364
2579211,4,B000FOPPBA,"Of the three alien invasion shows that debuted on network television in the fall of 2005, ""Invasion"" was the one that was hyped the most and for which the most success was predicted.  After all, ""Invasion"" had the advantage of airing on Wednesday night's after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B000FIMG68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Lost""</a>&nbsp;on ABC.  To be fair, in the end ""Invasion"" did get to air all 22 of its first season episodes, while NBC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Surface/dp/B000FJH5M2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Surface""</a>&nbsp;only got 15 episodes on and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Threshold/dp/B000FIHN8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Threshold""</a>&nbsp;filmed 14 episodes but only aired nine of them.  Now all three of the shows are available on DVD and all three proudly proclaim themselves to be ""The Complete Series,"" wearing their cancellations like badges of honor whether they deserve them or not.  All things considered, ""Invasion"" was my least favorite of the three, mainly because its story took the longest to develop.  Creator Shaun Cassidy was clearly thinking long-term and how to develop his mystery over the course for the first season, and certainly at the end of the year things were starting to get interesting.  But as far as I was concerned by then it was the proverbial too little, too late.

The start of ""Invasion"" had the advantage of art imitation life as the fictional Hurricane Eve strikes Homestead, Florida, on the edge of the Everglades.  The show's characters are a pair of families related by divorce and remarriage.  The show's nominal hero is Russ Varon (Eddie Cibrian), a U.S. park ranger in the Everglades who has a new wife, Larkin Groves (Lisa Sheridan), who is not only a reporter but also happens to be pregnant with their first child.  Russ' ex-wife, Dr. Mariel Underlay (Kari Matchett), is a medical doctor who has recently remarried as well, this time to Sheriff Tom Underlay (William Fichtner).  The children of Russ and Mariel, Jesse (Evan Peters) and Rose (Ariel Gade), live with Tom and Mariel, along with Kira Underlay (Alexis Dziena), Tom's daughter from a previous marriage.  Completing the cast is Dave Groves (Tyler Labine), Larkin's brother, who watches the kids and apparently has an encyclopedic knowledge of conspiracy theories.

Strange things happen to the characters when the hurricane strikes.  Rose sees lights coming down from the sky and landing in the water during the storm, while Mariel goes missing and is not found until the next day, at which point she is naked and remembers nothing but is physically untouched by the hurricane.  Only now she likes to take really long baths and seems really into water.  Then Dave finds what he is convinced is the skeleton of an extraterrestrial and we continue to see strange lights in the water.  But it is the Sheriff, with his strange words of comfort for his disoriented wife, who turns out to be the pivotal member of the cast of characters.

The strange lights in the water are an apt metaphor for ""Invasion,"" because here the threat is internal rather than external.  The show is much more in the tradition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers/dp/0782009980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""</a>&nbsp;than any of the traditional alien invasion movies with their bug-eyed monsters.  The mystery is not easy to figure out, as amply proven when Mariel finds her own body floating in the swamp and we all leap to the obvious and apparently wrong conclusion.  But clues were being parceled out as almost as slowly as the revelations and in the absence of clear answers having clues to work over becomes even more important.

In watching these episodes again the show certainly does make more sense, but I still see a strong beginning and a fairly strong ending, with things dragging on too much in the middle.  I have to think that if we did some serious editing of the middle third of ""Invasion"" that it would work a lot better.  It is not so much a question of omitting episodes as it is moving things along more quickly.  There was a point where the only reasons I kept watching ""Invasion"" was because it was one of the series I had cleared for the television unit for my class and because I was curious to see if it could free itself from the morass it was becoming (ironically, none of my students wrote about the show, but they used the course discussion board to try and figure out what was coming on, with limited success).

Before I watched ""Invasion"" again from start to finish I was learning towards rating it three stars because I was so disappointed by it given my expectations.  I ended up with a four star rating because the second time around I was focusing on Tom and Mariel rather than Russ and Larkin, and this shift in perspective made a big difference.  Going higher was not an option because all fans are going to find here for special features are deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a featurette ""Inside the Mind of Shaun Cassidy.""  Not having any commentary tracks for those fans who were anguished by the cancellation of the show is extremely disappointing.  You can also better appreciate how the series does go against your expectations time and time again, which should be a good thing, but not if you are looking at the show the wrong way.  Whether this is your first or second (plus) time through ""Invasion,"" let Fichtner's Tom Underlay be your guide (Say, do you think the character's last name was suppose to be a clue or something?).",1156204800,16,5739,5.266739846322722

2579215,5,B000FOPPBA,"My TV viewing is mostly of news, sports, movies and documentaries.  However, last season I stumbled across Invasion and was hooked immediately.

What followed was a season of utter frustration!  I never knew what to expect when I tuned in to watch what had become my favourite show.  Would it be a new episode?  Would it be a re-run?  Would it be some inane show that had nothing to do with Invasion, period?  How can a network expect any show to succeed when the viewers get treated like this?

Invasion was well written, well acted and had an absorbing plot line.  I only hope that some one out there in TV land realizes this and picks up the show.  Unfortunately, I don't see this happening.",1155600000,10,694,4.48
2579216,5,B000FOPPBA,"Poor Shaun Cassidy. If he didn't have bad luck he'd have no luck at all. In 1995, he created American Gothic, a creepy supernatural drama for network television that was unable to garner decent enough ratings to stay on the air. In 2005, he returned with Invasion, a contemporary spin on Invasion of the Body Snatchers and was one of several genre shows that capitalized on the success of Lost. It was smart and scary so, of course the network cancelled it.

Invasion is the kind of show that calls for a subtle kind of acting as characters have to appear normal while also having a certain look in their eyes that suggests something is not quite right. As a result, cryptic phrases take on a whole new meaning as we try to figure out who has been infected (for lack of a better phrase) by the aliens and who is still a 100% human.

The always watchable William Fichtner is excellent as the town sheriff. He seems a bit of a cold fish right from the start which makes you wonder if he has already been taken over by an alien before the hurricane even happened and future episodes elaborate on this point. But Fichtner's performance, the odd looks and things that he says, keep us constantly guessing as to the degree in which his character has been infected and the actor plays it so well. He is the master at being the calm yet menacing type and this is what makes Tom so unsettling at times.

Invasion aired right around the time of Hurricane Katrina and the clean-up and reaction to it is eerily mirrored on the show albeit with a science fiction spin. The writers effectively establish the cast of characters and their relationship to one another. They took advantage of the medium to flesh them out so that we become emotionally invested in the characters' lives.

The show works on several levels using its science fiction premise to comment on the differences between economic classes while also telling a good old fashion mystery as Russell uncovers evidence of an alien presence. Like Lost, when Invasion answers one of its key plot questions, two more are raised in its place. Just when you have a character figured out, they do or say something that makes you question your assumptions. Sadly, we probably will never find out how all the various storylines would have played out as Invasion was cancelled after only one season. Out of the crop of new SF/horror shows from last year, it was the best. Hopefully, this DVD set will expose more people to this excellent show.

""Invading the Mind of Shaun Cassidy"" explores the themes that run through the show with the cast and crew gushing about how much they loved his ideas. Everyone touches upon the show's mythology and clarifies a few things that were deliciously ambiguous in the show with Cassidy claiming that Invasion was not about alien invasion but human evolution.

Also included is a ""Gag Reel,"" a collection of amusing outtakes and blown lines.

Finally, there are deleted scenes for 13 episodes.",1155513600,22,2968,4.663479923518165
2579217,3,B000FOPPBA,"This is a series that is really going to lend itself very well to DVD.  As other reviewers have pointed out correctly, what absolutely killed this series was that it took so ungodly long for the plot to start coming together and rolling along.  When you're a new show and you're trying to establish a new audience, you simply cannot take six weeks or more to establish your plot.  People won't tune in that long and you could see it in the rating free-fall that 'Invasion' suffered after the first month.

It's a shame that they didn't pull it together sooner, because I felt that the show finished it's season very strong.  It's just a shame that, at that point, the damage was already done and it's target audience was already tuning into something else.

Patience paid off for those that watched, for those that didn't though, it's definitely worth a second look ...",1155168000,3,869,4.6103896103896105
2579218,5,B000FOPPBA,"Like most members of its small but loyal following, I was incredibly bitter when the season finale of Invasion ended on a devastating cliffhanger.  It joined the group of many, many other sci-fi shows I've loved and lost throughout the years.  Shows like Buffy and X-Files surprised me, staying on past their prime but allowing their stories to play out--in general, sci fi does not fare well outside of the sci-fi channel. (Sci-fi allowed one of its brilliant but cancelled shows to tie up loose ends with a mini-series. That won't be the case here).

But networks, I suppose, cannot keep on shows that lose money. And I mostly blame lazy audiences who are so accustomed to immediate gratification that they don't stick with a show that  builds character naturally and thoughtfully.  If you watch the show and recognize that it's about character, and family, and interrogations of what makes someone humnan, it's so much richer than a slam bang kind of adventure show.  So those of you who abandoned this show or never gave it a chance should give yourself the pleasure of this show.  It was elegant and atmospheric. I will remember it fondly, even though it had the most howlingly painful cliffhanger I've ever had to endure as lifetime watcher of cult shows.",1153958400,6,1261,4.810185185185185
2579219,5,B000FOPPBA,"""Invasion"" is a masterfully crafted sci-fi drama about a small Florida town undergoing some frightening changes in the wake of a hurricane.

The show has everything: an amazing, intriguing and twisted overall mystery, brilliant writing, great acting, real characters, a distinct, sinister tone, nonstop pacing, chilling thrills, great special effects (need I mention Lewis' thrilling encounter in Episode 10?), an absolutely sensational musical score (written by Jason Derlatka and Jon Ehrlich) and an obvious care taken in the making of the show.

ABC, having described the show as ""phenomenal,"" was completely out of its mind to cancel ""Invasion."" Here, two months after learning the horrible truth, it still makes me sick to my stomach that this show will no longer air on television. Yet, unlike what others have said in their reviews, there is absolutely no way I wouldn't buy this set just because no closure was given to the series. Sure, I'll always watch the heartbreaking final scene of ""The Last Wave Goodbye"" disgusted with ABC for canceling the show, but I'm still able to marvel at the incredible production values that made it such a joy to watch. It's like a painting whose artist we'll never know. Though it's frustrating that we'll never have a clear understanding of the unknown artist's life nor his or her motivation behind the painting, we can still gaze in wonder and appreciation at the piece of art before our eyes.

I have to say, though, I'm upset that the DVD will not include the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround track that was included in the HD airings of the show. The 2.0 is very disappointing. As for some wishful thinking, I'm crossing my fingers that the featurette called ""Invading the Mind of Shaun Cassidy"" will give us fans some more insight into the mystery that we weren't given a solution to. It's more likely it will be a six-minute clip of Shaun Cassidy explaining what the show is about (not that one can't get that from just WATCHING the show), but one can still hope!

At least we get a DVD release! And I'm not exaggerating when I say that the DVD set for ""Invasion,"" once in my hands, will be my most treasured DVD in my collection.",1153699200,2,2176,4.794666666666667

I have not watched a network series in years and spend any TV time with the History Channel, Discovery, Fox News, etc.  However I watched and taped every episode of INVASION.  It was good, different, well done and destined to fail from the start.  Why to I say this?

As was the case with ""Miracles"" 4 or 5 years ago, it was almost impossible to know when INVASION was coming on.  It would run for 4 weeks then be off for 2 or 3. Then repeat a week or two.  I would set my DVD at 9pm (the stated start time) only to find out it had come on at 9:04pm or 9:05pm.  What other program would have to put up with all of that? Think of all of the trash on television that is carried from year to year that has not had to endure the obstacles that INVASION did?  Of the 4 people I knew of that watched it in October, I was the only one left still watching it in April.  All the others said it was too hard to find it and they would just buy the DVD.

Well I have pre-ordered the DVD in spite of having taped all the episodes, because I want to show my support for this show and in the slim hope that this will help in the campaign to get it renewed for next year.

The DVD will be great if they only just tape the programs and remove the 18 minutes of ads.

A very rare type of show these days. Yes, Lost is good, but if you miss one episode of Lost, you literally are ...lost. Where with Invasion, the plot was not so ...tridiminsional.

With the endless breaks ups in airing the show and lack of good promotion for the show at the beginning of the season, it's failure wasn't in the quality, but in the networks failure to make it successful. The storyline was unique and interesting as well as the setting for the show and the actors were perfectly cast. I hope someone gets a clue and brings it back and give it a fighting chance this time.",1149984000,9,489,4.268817204301075
2579242,5,B000FOPPBA,"I was so saddened to see this show canceled. I always made sure my Wednesday nights were open , so that I could be home to watch it. Its true that it did start kinda slow, but it sure caught its stride in a hurry. I think the biggest problem was the fact abc never gave much attention to the show, and then when they stopped showing it for awhile and substituted all those stupid shows mis season, that kinda cost the show, many people kinda lost interest in it during that time, and when it came back on, they had already found other shows to watch then. Also after that period ABC never promoted it. there were lots of commercials for that stupid Lost, and that would of been a perfect spot to do lead ins for invasion, but nope, they didnt.

They say invasion was doomed because of the extreme costs involved, well what about lost ? That show must have 20 lead actors that are costing a fortune now.

I am just so sad to see Invasion go, Every time i turn my tv on the local abc channel, i think about the idiots at ABC, and the dis-service they did to the many viewers of this show.

It was picking up steam too, and i think another season would have proven that with a very large increase in viewers who were getting back to the show.

And lets not even mention the cliff hanger they left us with. Its such a shame.........!",1149811200,10,1329,4.1796875
2579243,5,B000FOPPBA,"This series deserved a second season.  It was just reaching its stride when ABC evidently found it lacked the vision and desire for quality and cancelled it in the 11th hour.

ABC was used to McStorytelling where you get a quip and cliched storyline and send the viewers on their way.  That was not the plan here.  This was **true** storytelling that built a firm foundation in plot and character development.  It made you think and wonder where it was all headed - and then you realized suddenly that it was going in area you had never thought of.  All you could do is drop your jaw and go ""wow"".

Truly innovative.  Truly unique.

It was never given a chance by a network who would pull it just as the story and audience were building and never gave it proper promotion.

I truly recommend it - but you will be saddened when you get to the end and realize there isn't any more.",1149724800,8,879,4.337423312883436
2579244,5,B000FOPPBA,"While some people may be turned off Invasion by the idea its a sci-fi show, they are missing out on a real treat. Invasion isn't just about aliens - its about families and step-families trying to stay together and keep each other safe in a dangerous, disaster ridden world. Invasion is utterly gripping, beautifully crafted, gloriously shot and superbly acted. Invasion wipes the floor with Lost - while Lost always leaves me feeling slighlty cheated, Invasion leaves me satisfied but greedy for more.

2579245,5,B000FOPPBA,"A really outstanding series that started slowly but steadily built momentum over the season, finally rushing to a stunnning Season Finale climax complete with cliffhanger.  It SHOULD have been renewed, and evidently was GOING to be until the last moment, when its cast, crew and audience were left shocked by its demise.  Production values, writing, and acting are all first-rate, and I love the strong subtext of ""family"" -- broken families, blended families, families whose members have resentments and fights but still care for each other.  Sheriff Tom Underlay makes a great, ambiguous central character who can be favorably compared to Shaun Cassidy's Sheriff Buck from his previous show, ""American Gothic.""  (My feelings about Tom did a complete shift from suspicion to love during the the run of the season, thanks to the clever writers!)  Hopefully this series can be saved by the grassroots movement currently gaining momentum, or a new network can be found for its home, but regardless of what happens, Mr. Cassidy deserves praise for this amazing series.  At least we have the opportunity to obtain this first season on DVD, for which I'm grateful!",1149465600,238,1159,5.138297872340425
2579246,5,B000FOPPBA,"Briefly speaking......This was a great sci-fi show that I found enjoying and each week I looked forward to watching this. Once again though we of the sci-fi community was burned and not once but three times as all three networks brought us some sci-fi and then immediately took it away.

I guess there is still a little hope it might come back. There are many fans who are writing letters to ABC and the Sci-Fi Channel. There are also websites for ""Saving Invasion"".

1. I thought the Audio was done good and clean.

2. Filming was decent. Picture was sharp and nice colors

3. Decent effects and sets/costumes/props

4. Liked how they did the story. Started mysterious and slowly we learned what was happening.

5. Liked the faster pace as the season got towards its end

6. Both Cast And Crew did a good job

ABC made a big mistake dumping this great show and leaving tens of millions of viewers in the ""lurch"".",1149379200,26,913,4.524390243902439
2579247,4,B000FOPPBA,"Of the several shows that have tried to launch off of the LOST lead-in, this one was probably the best.  Only just barely related to INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (in the sense of human bodies being replaced by alien replicas), the series revolved around a small Florida town in which a segment of the population had turned alien during a hurricane.  This premise allowed for alot of promising drama as families and friends had to deal with certain of their members being turned while others remained human.  To add suspense to the mix, the sheriff of the town was revealed from the get-go to be one of the lead aliens, along with his wife, while her EX-husband and family (including two children) remained human.  Furthermore, as the series unfolded, we learned that there were competing factions among the aliens, some peaceful and concerned for their safety from other aliens AND the military, while the other segment was violent and bent on world-domination (usually resulting in self-destructive behavior).  As for the rest of the drama and the many plot-points that arose along the way, you'll just have to watch to see for yourself.  Just bear in mind that this is the one and ONLY season the show will ever have (unless another network picks it up, which is unlikely).

INVASION sadly got off to a slow start but by the time the mid-season finale was reached, everything was moving along nicely and the actors were beginning to fill their roles very nicely.  Early on, the sheriff and his wife established themselves as the anchor-actors and characters of the show, and they were the reason I came back and stayed faithful to the show for its second half.  But by the time the finale came, I had grown fond of ALL the actors and the characters they played.  It's just too bad that they won't get a second chance to carry on the story, because they had sown many seeds for a promising second season.

What did the show in was not being able to capture the audience right away.  I myself didn't get past the first episode, but tuned in at about episode 10, and by then things had gotten VERY exciting - but most people never gave the show a second chance.  Let that be a lesson - taking your time with a story is a wonderful thing (despite what UK Ramsey said below in his anti-USA TV rant) - but you have to kick things off with enough of a bang to lock viewers in BEFORE you slow things down.  What Ramsey's comments reveal is a sad truth about today's viewing audience - people are just too scatter-brained to give a story time to unfold.  But hopefully, shows like LOST and INVASION will open the door for more series of the like that take their time and slow people down a bit.

By the way - if you liked the show and are interested in trying to get it renewed on ABC or another network, buy the DVD set. In fact, pre-order it and show the suits that there is a large audience for this show that is willing to spend money on it!  $$$ is the only language the suits speak!!",1149292800,121,2984,4.455882352941177
2579248,5,B000FOPPBA,"I tend not to watch much TV but I started watching Invasion with my son and boy did I get hooked.  The story is well scripted and you really get a chance to know all the characters.  The alien side is intriguing and well thought out.  I became totally absorbed.  By the final episode I was totally stuck to my seat.  If you are looking for a well scripted, well acted SciFi come drama come suspense then Invasion has it all.",1149120000,9,424,4.185185185185185

The first season was incredible...kept me glued to my TV every week, which is saying something considering I watch so little TV that my cable was out once for 5 days before I turned the television on to find out!  ABC really made a poor decision when they cancelled this show.  It was one of the few rare gems out there today.  Hopefully we can save it before it's too late...SaveInvasion.net",1149120000,9,498,4.625
2579250,1,B000FOPPBA,"Yep! that's right this show was as boring as hell. Watching paint dry would be more preferable. This show in addition to Lost is another example of smug American television where drama output is dictated by the advertisers. So thus the advertisers decide that in order to keep the audience tuned in the show must have mysteries in the plot that can be strung out for ages so that they can maximize thier profits from lots of advertising. They'll also include a central mystery into the show which they know they're going to string out for as long as possible. This is the bottom line. It has nothing to do with good, strong narrative which actually goes somewhere. Also the acting in both shows and the dialogue/characterization is atrocious. This is the main problem with current US fantasy/ sci-fi televsion at the moment. However US TV CAN do it right. Look at Desperate Houswives where there is a general momentum in terms of storytelling and things develop and are even resolved quickly. Unfortunately for Invasion and Lost the audience can see through the facade and that is why the viewing figures are falling. Interestingly the viewing figures for both shows have tumbled dramtically here in the UK showing that people sooner or later are going to switch off. Unfortunately in America the population is too easily fooled by hype and will watch anything until they realize the show is a dud and it soon gets cancelled by the network. Americans need to realize there is more to life than TV and films and not be so easily fooled by marketing and buzz!",1149120000,6,1557,4.727941176470588
2579251,5,B000FOPPBA,"I was gripped to the great storyline of aliens, military coverup and freak weather conditions. The entire cast are great on this show. Anyone who loved films like The Bodysnatchers, Aliens, Twister,Independance Day or the V - mini series will love this show. William Fichtner plays a great strong central character as Sheriff Tom Underlay, one of his best roles I believe. He has a great split personality on screen in Invasion from being quite a scary mysterious character who you fear, to whom has great love and will do whatever it takes to protect his family and friends. ABC did poor marketing and scheduling on this show, thus it now is cancelled. Great story to be continued for a future series for another TV station or movie.",1149033600,19,734,4.7421875

2579253,4,B000FOPPBA,"I must say that I found the first few episodes pretty boring, hell I'd get up and forget I was watching the show. It was sorta lame that during Lost, they'd be like the 4 star hit Invasion is next! When it was nothing compared to Lost. We constantly got reminded that the aliens like water. Their were tons of times where we see the blonde mother who became one of them, in the bathtub breathing under water. So it was like ""ok, we get it, they like water!!"".  While the main actor who plays Russel seems as if he went to Matthew Fox acting school. Everytime I saw him, I kept forgetting his name wasn't Jack. I found a lot of the acting dull too in the earlier episodes.

  However this show got a hell of a lot better by the time the finale came along. The acting even got better and I even started to love the characters. The finale gives us a great cliffhanger and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next in season 2 and the very next day I found out....it was CANCELED!!! So although this show got better and was actually turning into the four star hit they were talking about it's not coming back. I think the 10 p.m time slot after Lost is what did it in. After Lost being so gripping with each episode taking alot out of you, I always forgot their was even a show on after it. I think if next year they put Invasion on at 8:00 and Lost on at 9:00 then it could've done better. A lot of people don't even watch tv at 10 p.m. Anyway I really wanted to see what would happen next and because of stupid abc we never will!  Why do they bother even saying season finale if they don't plan on bringing a show back anyway ??",1148688000,11,1630,4.08125

8125023,1,B000FOPPBA,"The discs come in a folding cardboard contraption. The discs play fine. The same cant be said for the series. Stupid, dumb, moronic, muddled, confused, disorganized, nonsensical, pretentious, sanctimonious, myopic, ludicrous, a complete waste of time and money. Its even worse than Revolution (2012-2014), which is another one of those series you want to throw away after one viewing.

I remember liking Surface (2005-2006), which aired on NBC the same year as Invasion. Invasion aired on ABC. Both series have similar rating and reviewer numbers and are one-hour mystery dramas so I took a chance on Invasion. I remember liking the three main characters in Surface, but I didn't like the characters in Invasion, or the love triangle crap. The love triangle is as overused today as the slow-motion clap. BORING!

Invasion tried to copy Losts style, but failed. The story and characters are not fun or interesting to watch. Lost (2004-2009) was good. Its easy to see why Invasion was cancelled. I recommend you spend your time and money on something else. Ive listed some suggestions below.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1512864000,,2113,5.432926829268292
