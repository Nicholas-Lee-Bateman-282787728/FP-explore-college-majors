8762257,1,B01G3M94R8,Just not what I expected and the script was terrible please do not waste your money. The actors are terrible and it is on the shelf where it will probably stay. I liked nothing about the movie.,1531180800,,193,4.243243243243243
8762258,4,B01G3M94R8,really like this movie,1522108800,,22,4.75
8762259,4,B01G3M94R8,"Story depicts a subculture seldom seen on the screen. Characterization not as strong as perhaps could have been therefore somewhat rough to watch for most of film. Actions of characters seemed overly emotional and sporadic as a result, in my opinion. Also, my copy was flawed in section 8 (critical part of film). Yikes!

Conclusion, however, seemed to make sense. More attention to characterization in future films about this subculture may be painful yet helpful.",1518912000,,465,5.2

8762262,4,B01G3M94R8,I thought that the movie was pretty good. I could definitely relate to the storyline being that I was in this situation myself. It also goes to show you just who your true friends are in the time of need.,1482796800,,204,4.125
