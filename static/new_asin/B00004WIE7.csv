1365482,5,B00004WIE7,"After the new TAs known as Fakes arrive on the scene, a batle starts and ends in a sand storm. That fight is continued later in the episode as the team of TAs walk right into the Fakes' trap. The battle concludes leaving the TAs with a sample of the Fakes. The second episode is even more intense as the JSSDF scuries to get the TAs out of Belgistan, but then Yushiro runs off again to see Miharu. Miharu and Yushiro become targets of Symbol, but get rescued by a man named Phantom. Phantom gives them a place to stay and Yushiro gets picked up. The crew of the JSSDF takes off back to Japan and are then forced to take on Armekistan aircrafts with a TA latched to a steel teather. Seeing Captain Ataka trying to talk in English was a very funny part of the subtitled version. There is a lot of funny stuff on this tape that you can only get in the subtitled version. If you can afford it, get it. Its worth it. Action, intrique and little bits of humor. The perfect show.",978912000,,972,4.175531914893617
1365483,5,B00004WIE7,"This was a great tape. The animation is still the best. And the dub is still good. The first episode picks up were the last one left off. And we get to see some robot vs. robot action. With Yushiro fighting the girl in his dreams. You will be pleased. We also learn more about the other TA piolets. Then in the second episode we see Yushiro meet the girl. With introducing new characters as well. Even though there isn't as much action in this one until the end, the story will still keep you intrigued. And the action is great to. I am not going to spoil it, But it isn't in the robots this time.  The third episode is my favorite. As Yushiro is heading back to Japan, with the rest of the piolets, with the Ta's in a big plane, get attacked. (forgive the run-on sentence) And how they handle it will keep you on the edge. This is a great series, and is highly recomended.",978134400,,873,4.165680473372781
7925440,4,B00004WIE7,"The war in Belgistan explodes in a violent eruption as the UN Forces launch a final offensive against the capital. Giant robots face giant robots for the 1st time as Yushiro and the girl that haunts his dreams meet on the battlefield. The JSSDF, the UN, the media, and opposing armies are pitted against each other as the puppetmasters of Symbol fan the flames of war into a conflagration that threatens to engulf the world. Something is amiss in Belgistan. It seems that this war was tailor made for some hidden purpose.

This volume is much better that the 1st. There is more action and drama. The story is also starting to make more sense . Even though much is still very unclear, this series is pretty intriguing. I am starting to enjoy Gasaraki, but it is a long way from being anything akin to a great anime series.",1355356800,,821,4.510067114093959
7925441,4,B00004WIE7,"The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-volume-of-Gasaraki/dp/B00004W5XG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first volume of Gasaraki</a>&nbsp;really surprised me. It was well written and thoughtful, trying to tell a deep story that was more about behind the scenes power plays than robot brawls.

This second disc continues to add new wrinkles and complications. The war with Belgistan comes to a close (which surprised me as I thought it was going to run through the entire series) and the JSSDF forces prepare to pull out. We learn about a secret organization calling itself Symbol that was assisting Belgistan, though their motivations for doing so are still clouded.

Yushiro causes some commotion when he heads off base and winds up in the middle of a kidnapping. We also see more of the mysterious girl from the first disc that seems to share Yushiro's powers.

Very little seems to happen episode by episode. If the disc is watched straight through it is very satisfying viewing, but I can see that if I were watching this half an hour at a time as it was broadcast it would have been tough to follow.",1251072000,,1145,5.385474860335195
7925442,4,B00004WIE7,"Gasaraki is a futuristic, war-time tale utilizing ""mechas""; or ""Tactical Armor"", as the weapon du jour. Gasaraki is an unfolding type of story whereas plot points are doled out sparingly and new characters are introduced frequently.  Think war epics from the 1960's with dozens of movie stars as an example.
It is refreshing to see an anime that strives to be adult in a more geo-political and character driven way rather than by the over use of sex. The writers here worked very hard to create a refreshing storyline that creates a multitude of conflicts rather than focusing on a simple conflict as most animes do.
The plots are many encompassing not just the war, the politics, and social interaction but Japanese spiritual themes are included as well.  A heavy use of Shinto religious themes and icons gives the story a mystical edge.

The story plays out by immersing the audience into the conflict by showing it from different points of view.  You see this war from the media point of view, such as a ""live CNN-like"" report from the front lines with its grainy footage and color commentary, from the Generals' war room, from within the Tactical Armor itself, and the ""mecha's"" support crew as well.
The Character design is very good, especially the hardware though one particular annoying choice the designers made was the use of long hair on a particular ""Tactical Armor"" pilot.  You have a story line here that rarely dissapoints and takes military and political protocol as accurately as it can but a particular T.A. pilot has hair that is way too stylized for the type of detailed story. This could be my particular quirk but it bothered me that his fellow crew and mostly every other soldier had military looking short hair.
The english Dub is very good.  Generally speaking the actors did an above average job.  The DVD interface is hassle free though I wish they would of included more extras.
A final point that frustrated me about Gasaraki is the animation frame rate.  At times it can be to static or the walk cycles can be choppy.  Obviously the budget was spent on the designers, actors, and director rather than the ""in between artists"".
This is a must see anime but don't expect it be flawless, just expect to be entertained.",1035936000,,2245,4.750642673521851
7925443,4,B00004WIE7,"This was similar to the first volume.  Now however, the TA's have fought in real battle and there has been more action than the first volume- slowly things are coming together.  Volume 3 is when you'll decide if you like the series or not though- There is a lot more action and more character development than the first 2 volumes.  Although Volumes 1 and 2 seem slow, it is important for a basis for the rest of the series so bear through it!  Again, I recommend you rent the first 3 volumes before buying them to decided whether or not you'll like the series.  I really enjoyed this series and it took the first 3 volumes to figure that out.",1013040000,,642,4.316666666666666
7925444,4,B00004WIE7,"I am finding the series very interesting. But it does have it's flaws. The plot as to what is really going on is very slow in being shown.
  There was a little more character development in these episodes which was good and alot more action. This series is far from perfect. But it is interesting enough to warrant veiwing.",1006300800,,323,4.4576271186440675
7925445,2,B00004WIE7,"After purchasing the first in this series of DVDs, I was eagerly awaiting the next one in the series.  However I was disapointed in this vid.  Their were less episodes on this disk than the first one and fewer extras.  I will admit that the story is still excellent, although frustrating at times, and the animation is superb.  ... I would rather buy the Robotech legacy DVD or even Fight Club instead of this vid.
Sincerely:
David C. Eberhart II",1000684800,,446,4.5375
7925446,5,B00004WIE7,"I have seen both DVD, and both are excellent. The animation is perfect, they don't miss any detail and the robots are the best. The characters are very similar to REI and Shinji, but I don't have nothing against that. The giant Robots meet in combat and also the characters, and we have the first image of the ""TERROR"" (KUGAI). I recomend this DVD because of the cuality of the anime, the story and the development of the series is extremly exciting.",982886400,2,450,4.5
7925447,4,B00004WIE7,"If you saw the first tape, you know the drill. If not, that's what Gasaraki is in a nutshell: if you want cool acrobatics, ninja action, or see the whimpy hero grow a spine to save that good looking girl you'll have to pass this one up. It's not how it works in real life, and Gasaraki closely follows the way things are in our world. The show to this point is about real people living in a real world, politics, blurry lines between right or wrong, battles where you survive by luck as much as by skill. In this world, sandstorms will affect tanks and mechas, just like real life.
What it means, though, is that when something weird happens, it really feels weird! When was the last time you were surprised in Tenchi Muyo? There's many tidbits that will leave you wondering. Half glimpsed images of things that just can't be. Strange people with secret agendas. The fact that the main characters aren't invincible really add to the suspense though.
I've seen later episodes, and I can tell it gets even better, if you hadn't checked this series out, do it. It's unique.",982368000,2,1070,4.492307692307692
7925448,5,B00004WIE7,"The series is deeper than most out there, and more interesting as well. The storyline and character development are in-line with quality of other great anime titles like Macross. The animation is very good, excellent for an on-going series. The story is the most original of it's type since Macross, due to the overpopulated anime world of mechs. The characters are not cute little furrys and strange looking bug eyed types of alot of anime, but more in tone with mature audiences, characters you can relate to more than just emotionally but physically. The mechs for instance aren't as anime as Macross in that they are more like Metal Gear, military types with restrictions on what they can do. They are not skyscraper size yet agile, they are machines, extensions of the pilots as if they were real. They are under more real physics than alot of other mechs in anime, they actually malfunction when they get clogged with sand in the desert in this particular volume. Very entertaining and very interesting original story as well as well developed characters.",980208000,3,1061,4.9
7925449,5,B00004WIE7,"The shoe picks up from where it last left off. Yushiro was in shock and the Fakes from Symbol are attacking. Yushiro manages to get back up into his TA, but then a rampid sand storm occurs and the TAs and Fakes draw back. They resume their battle later at an abandoned town in Belgistan. Yushiro gets an even closer encounter with Miharu (a girl who is strikingly similar to Yushro and possess the same powers as he does). The battle is stopped when Tornado Bombers make a pass over the battle and film the battle to show to the world. They then proceed to bomb Belgistan. It appears that Symbol betrayed Belgistan and Belgistan is wiped out of the picture. The JSDF is now in a struggle to get out of Belgistan. However, Yushiro goes wandering off again to find Miharu. He finds her at the stone church of Akura and manage to explain some things. Yushiro and Miharu are soon split up again. Yushiro heads back to Japan and Miharu returns to Symbol's custody. The extras on the DVD are very nice if you like to go in depth on this show. The Japanese dialoge is extremely good and more funnier than the English. Hearing Captain Ataka in Japanese trying to speak English is very funny. Not to mention some jokes about Japanese language. Anyway, dubbed or subbed, either way you view it, its still great. It doesn't have as much action as the first tape, but it still has action and it still is great. A must have DVD.",979344000,,1415,4.404580152671755
