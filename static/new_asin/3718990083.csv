You just can't help but root for the lead couple; they are too cute for words. I speak quite a bit of Korean and I have to say that the subtitles are a lot better than I expected. They're easy to understand and it's pretty close to the actual translations. The DVD case is nice and sturdy, and it came to me in good condition. My only issue is that, like another review mentioned, things like the soundtrack are fuzzied or taken out. A part of what makes this drama what it is is the music and the 1997 references, so I feel as though they've censored out a crucial part of the drama. That's the only reason why this gets 3 stars. The drama itself would've been 5 stars, hands down. In the end, I'm still happy to have this in my collection.",1442188800,,852,4.33125
7802229,4,3718990083,"This is my favorite drama, so I'm happy I can watch it whenever I want. The video quality is good as well. I only gave this 4 stars because when it arrived, the case was extremely damaged and my DVDs were thrown all over the box. I thought it was going to be damaged, but everything is fun. Amazon, please work on your DVD packaging, because this isn't the first time I received damaged goods.",1436745600,,393,4.253333333333333
7802230,4,3718990083,"I ordered the cd for my home and didn't appreciate that when I selected English subtitles which is grouped with Chinese, although English is written which I like, Chinese is spoken.  Therefore, I lose the actual voices of actors speaking in Korean.",1435881600,,248,4.904761904761905
7802231,2,3718990083,"The show is great, but things are fuzzied out, like the screens on TV and the songs in the soundtrack are removed.  It partially wrecks the mood and plot.  Get the original as it seems the makers of this did series did not have the rights to show any licences material.",1434067200,,269,4.254901960784314

7802235,5,3718990083,"If you are new to K-Drama, this is a good place to start.  It is also a great showcase for Jung Eun-Ji who at only 19 establishes herself as a charismatic actress with great potential.  (And if you like her acting, you should hear her sing.)",1400457600,,241,4.217391304347826

7802237,4,3718990083,Light-hearted and comical high school episodes.  It sure takes Korean characters a long time in these kinds of stories to grow up and figure out what's going on!,1395532800,,161,4.75
