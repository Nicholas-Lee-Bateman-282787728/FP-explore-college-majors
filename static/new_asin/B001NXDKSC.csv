3724158,3,B001NXDKSC,"The Madagascar 2 movie is a great flick, full of fun and witty lines.  If you liked the first movie, this is more of the same, if not better and probably worthy of five stars.  The second DVD featuring two Nick Penguin shorts for a total of about 25 minutes of video, isn't worth the additional cost, in my opinion.  The first Madagascar release had a Penguin animation short included as an extra on the movie disc, whereas the new one has two shorts and charges the buyer for the priviledge.  And frankly, I thought that the two penguin cartoons, while a bit amusing, were a bit of a disappointment.  If one is a REAL fan of the Nick Penguins, then you'll need to get this DVD set.  Otherwise, I would recommend just getting the main feature and save yourself the $7.",1233878400,49,768,4.373239436619718
3724159,5,B001NXDKSC,I TOOK MY SON TO THE MOVIES TO SEE THIS AND IT WAS GREAT!!!  MUCH BETTER THEN THE FIRST MOVIE.  THIS IS A GREAT SELECTION TO SHARE WITH THE ENTIRE FAMILY AND I FEEL YOU CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AND STILL LOVE IT!!,1233792000,,215,3.7555555555555555
3724180,5,B001NXDKSC,"I have enjoyed this movie.  Great for children and adults.  Even the youngest in our family, under 2, loved watching it and danced to the songs.  Shows great relationships between characters - good values.",1250035200,2,205,4.970588235294118

3724182,2,B001NXDKSC,"To make it short and sweet, Madagascar 2 was disappointing at best. After the first one I was wondering where they could go with this second release. It would appear that they chose to go nowhere. There was one or two chuckles during the movie and that would just about sum it up. The extra money you pay for the Penguin shorts was a waste.",1239062400,,340,4.246153846153846

3724185,5,B001NXDKSC,"It is hillariously funny. They included this old lady who will fight anybody including the animals.  The penguins always make the movie worth seeing. In my opinion, it is definitely better than the first movie.  I sang the song ""I like the way you move it, move it for days""!",1238803200,,275,4.48
3724186,5,B001NXDKSC,"Mad 2 was tons of fun! Lots of humor and as before, the characters had that human quality.  As for the 'Nick' The Penquins of Madagascar....save your money, you aren't missing a thing.",1238630400,,184,4.575757575757576
3724187,4,B001NXDKSC,"we enjoy the movie. It would have gotten 5 stars if the extra DVD had more on it...there are two short movies about the other characters, but I really expected a little more on that 2nd DVD.  Maybe another short movie, extended/deleted scenes.....a little more.  Cute though, worth getting.",1238284800,,290,4.8979591836734695
3724188,4,B001NXDKSC,"My ten year old daughter was very disapoinnted when she unpacked her DVDs. It was supposed to be (as advertised)a commom picture devided through the two DVDs. But if the Penguin picture was the good one, the Madagascar one was the regular indivudual one; which did not match the other one. So she was disapointed, but still enjoyed the the movies. But when you advertise something, you could at least warn ahead of time if you have supply shortages.",1237939200,,449,4.69620253164557

3724202,5,B001NXDKSC,My kids loved both the movie and the Nick Penguins in the double DVD pack!,1237593600,,74,4.0
3724203,5,B001NXDKSC,"My daughters, age 5 and 10, really enjoy this movie.  It's very funny ! I really like this one too.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with kids......get it !",1237507200,,174,4.40625
3724204,5,B001NXDKSC,"The price was competitive with many other stores. I wanted this as I just love the penguins. I was dissapointed with how short the penguin disk was, there are two short stories, with good story lines. I think they have missed a trick with this, as there must be others who love the penguins.
Madagascar 2 is probably as good as M1 but the storyline takes awhile to get into and develops better at the end. But then, I am a grandparent, perhaps I expect too much. Tom & Jerry remain my favorites.",1237507200,,495,4.333333333333333
3724205,4,B001NXDKSC,"The movie gets three stars but the ""STAR"" are the Penguins. They are great. I couldn't stop laughing. I gave Madagascar 2 to my daughter but I kept the Penguins for myself.",1237161600,,172,4.40625
3724206,5,B001NXDKSC,"OK, well it is a sequel so you lose the originality of the ideas up front, but we still liked M2 and it kept our kids' interest the whole time.

And the Penguins disc was great too and something we could watch multiple times.",1236988800,,225,4.113636363636363

3724209,5,B001NXDKSC,"Our whole family enjoyed this movie. The Penguins are just too funny not to laugh. And let's not forget 'Moto Moto, a name so cool you have to say it twice'! HAHA",1236729600,,162,4.09375
3724220,4,B001NXDKSC,"I enjoyed Madagascar immensely, just as I did the original.  At first, I thought the story wasn't going to be as good, but it turned out to be just as funny and entertaining.  The penguins are a favorite, so I purchased the 2-DVD set to see more of them.  I must say that I was disappointed in the quantity of the material on the penguin DVD considering the additional cost.  Had I known that there were only two mini movies, with the rest being ""extra"" features, I would have purchased just the Madagascar DVD and tried to rent the penguin one sometime.  Quality is 5-star.  Quantity (penguin DVD) is 4-star.  Highly recommended!",1236643200,,630,4.571428571428571
3724221,5,B001NXDKSC,I thought the movie was great!  I liked the fact that the original cast came back for the sequel.,1236556800,,97,4.105263157894737
3724222,4,B001NXDKSC,"I bought this double dvd package for my grandkids (that's what I tell people anyway).  The Madagascar 2 movie is very, very good.  The levels of humor are many and some of the references (political, racial and otherwise) are very, pointed and funny for grown-ups - way beyond a child's comprehension.

They did a good job in keeping continuity with the characters introduced in Madagascar 1.

The penguins are funny - The Penguin dvd with the Penguins is funny,  but, most of the dvd is a Wild Kingdom program - the grandkids were quick to point out the Penguin segment has already been shown on TV.  For the money - get the single Madagascar 2 movie.",1236556800,,651,4.568965517241379
3724223,5,B001NXDKSC,"I actually pre-ordered the double DVD and saved $3, because the price went down. I wasn't disappointed at all! This movie was very funny and well worth the purchase. My children watch this movie all the time and I find myself watching as well. I pick up things I missed when I watched previously. The star studded cast only adds to the enjoyment I'm sure.",1236470400,,355,4.476923076923077
3724224,5,B001NXDKSC,"This movie is so good for young kids & really a nice spin off from part 1.
I really rate this film A+. It's a nice and warm movie for family viewing!",1236470400,,149,3.6875
3724225,4,B001NXDKSC,"Madagascar 2 was every bit as entertaining as the first and loads of fun.  I was disappointed in ""The Penguins of Madagascar"" however.  It's a couple of shorts and had I known that before I bought the set, I would have opted to purchase only the main movie.",1236384000,,257,4.333333333333333
3724226,2,B001NXDKSC,"The Penguins of Madagascar was by far better than the Madagascar 2 movie because it was funnier. I was BOARD during the M2 movie because there was too much talking and not enough gags like the first. I definitely RECOMMEND ""The Penguins of Madagascar"".",1236384000,,252,4.75
3724227,3,B001NXDKSC,"I thought I was getting a two movie deal but that was not the case. Madagascar 2 was great. My 2 year and I have have watched it SEVERAL times, lol. I thought the penguins was another movie but it was not! That part was dissapointing. Buy Madagascar by all means but you can stay away from the penguins.",1236211200,,303,4.1525423728813555
3724228,5,B001NXDKSC,Cute fun and the penguin movie was definitely worth it for us.  It was given to my 6 year old for a Valentine's Day Present and he spent hours just watching the Penguin movie.,1236211200,,175,4.147058823529412
3724229,1,B001NXDKSC,"This duo was given to my son the other day. After watching the original movie, I was pretty sure I wouldn't like one or two references and scenes, but I gave this one a chance, just so I wouldn't be the mean old parent.

What a mistake! This movie, a PG, is not anything you'd want your child to watch. For 10 or 15 minutes, we laughed, but then I no longer could laugh when the blatant sexual references began to pile on. In addition to the suggestive language, the characters make pointed references to each other's bodies and the song lyrics are salacious at times.

Beyond that, the writers seem to think that physical violence is hilarious, so the viewer is faced with scenes of guns and beatings -- and not the momentary cartoon violence of a Three Stooges movie. Regrettably, the vindictive old woman with the pocketbook figures largely in this sequel, and most of her scenes feature harangues and beatings.

The movie isn't worth watching beyond the first 10 minutes anyway. There's not a laugh to be had after that. The love story between two of the main characters drags the story down. Even at 10, my son isn't interested in this sort of plot. Why is our culture so intent on sexualizing young children?

Next time, I'll listen to my inner parent and just say no. I can take my child's disappointment better than I can take my own disappointment in myself.",1236038400,16,1367,4.544715447154472
3724240,5,B001NXDKSC,"We saw Madagascar 2 in the theatres..and didn't like it as much as the first.  But then we got the dvd - and it's started to grow on us.  My kids, 7 and 3, watch it regularly..and they love the penguins video..it's worth the extra $4 to get it",1235779200,,243,3.938775510204082
3724241,5,B001NXDKSC,"This is a movie that parents will enjoy as much as their kids.  It is very funny with some great characters.  The film itself is beautiful - really colorful and looks great on the tv.

As for the extra dvd ""The Penguins of Madagascar""  it is well worth the extra few dollars.  The writing is hilarious.  I believe these are previews of the new Nick TV show  that premiers in March.  I, the parent, can't wait to see it!  My children laughed all the way thru and are also excited to see the new show when it airs.

There is also an ""extra"" on this Penguin  video that is really adorable.  Alex the lion teaches you some of his dance moves and then puts them all together with a catchy song from the movie.  My kids love to dance along and it is a riot to watch them.  I can't even count how many times they've played this dance video.  Its great exercise for them too!",1235347200,,867,4.13855421686747
3724242,3,B001NXDKSC,Yes we all know sequels are not as good as the first one but this sequel wasn't too bad.  It doesn't keep my kids attention as much as the first one does but still cute.  I was disappointed that they tried to throw in a love story.  The movie is for kids not us.  The penguins DVD is cute with a couple of episodes not a full length movie so don't fool yourself to think that you are getting two movies for the price of one. Oh! check out the music videos too.  They re-worked the move-it move it song.  My daughter likes the original video.  I think these are worth owning but the original is viewed a lot more in my house.,1235001600,,624,4.024390243902439
3724243,5,B001NXDKSC,The Madagascar movies are the aboslutely faves of myself and my son!  We saw this one in the theater and have already watched it about 15 times!  I would reccomend this for any parent/kid time!,1234915200,,193,4.485714285714286
3724244,4,B001NXDKSC,"My daughter is almost 3, and I am always looking for movies I can stand to watch with her. I did not watch the first one, she has fifty times. I thought that it was funny and my daughter loves the Move it Move it song. The second disk with the Penguins is a rip off. It is a few episodes from the new show. Did not feel like it was worth the extra money. They were funny, but I was expecting a full movie, not 25 minutes worth.",1234656000,,427,3.808988764044944
3724245,5,B001NXDKSC,"Yes there is only 24 minutes (two different short stories) of penguin antics on the DVD but for an extra 4 bucks what do you want.  If you like the penguins you will be amused.  King Julien and Maurice are in the second story carrying-on with typical shenanigans of not knowing what a camera is...funny stuff!

3724246,1,B001NXDKSC,I bought the two DVD Set hoping I'd be able to enjoy the Penguins again.  The 2nd DVD was entirely misrepresented.  About the best I can do is to give it to my five-year-old niece.,1234396800,3,180,4.114285714285714
3724247,5,B001NXDKSC,"Funnier than Madgascar 1. I bought the DVD, my daughter's moble DVD player could not play blue-ray.",1234224000,,99,4.882352941176471
3724248,3,B001NXDKSC,"I repeatedly hear comparisons of Madagascar 2 with The Lion King. I don't see anything more than a _very_ superficial similarity between the two movies. Not enough to even be worth a comment.

However, much of the opening sequence is a direct steal from a far better movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Brothers-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JN2B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two Brothers (Widescreen Edition)</a>. The way the sequence ends suggests that it is not theft so much as one of the many ""references"" made in this movie, but I doubt enough people saw Two Brothers to make the reference really work.

There are also many similarities to another movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jungle-Emperor-Leo/dp/B0000B1A0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jungle Emperor Leo</a>, beginning at the end of that same opening sequence and running throughout all of Alex's story. I can't see that being an intentional reference.

But my reason for a weak star rating is that they simply tried to do too much in Madagascar 2. They have at least 5 stories going on simultaneously, all of which needed more screen time to be satisfying. Alex's story gets the most screen time; unfortunately it is a story we've all seen hundreds of times, and it is still so rushed that there's not enough time to add the little touches that would have made the journey to the foregone conclusion worthwhile.

As for the second disc in this 2-pack, you get 2 TV-style cartoons featuring the penguins and some of the lesser characters from the movie (there is no continuity with the movie storyline). They're cute and funny, but it's only 25 minutes plus some minor ""special features"", so considering the extra cost of this pack over the single-disc movie only, it's not really good value for your money.

Overall, Madagascar 2 is a safe enough kid's movie -- most kids probably won't notice the lack of substance -- with nothing to make the parents squeamish (unless you're offended by screen-filling butt shots), but there's also nothing to elevate it to the level of the two movies I noted above.",1233964800,5,2159,5.5105740181268885
