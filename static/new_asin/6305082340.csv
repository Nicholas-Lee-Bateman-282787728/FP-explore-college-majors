7990218,3,6305082340,"In fairness, this video CAN be used as supplemental instruction for beginning students and/or their parents. In my case, it served well for my substitute teacher to use when I was out sick during the third week of school. By writing a good worksheet, I was able to focus my students' attention on a review of the ""basics:"" posture, breathing, instrument care, etc. The worst part of the video is the excrutiatingly dull ""Music Theory"" lesson. In addition, both presenters just seemed to be scared to death to be on camera. It's not great, but there's some useful stuff here.",1031443200,,574,4.75
7990219,1,6305082340,"I have seen many instructional videos in my time and this one is the worst.  Not only does the quality of this video set a new standard for cheapness but, the instructor can't even play!  The video appears to be  shot on a low quality camcorder in someone's very depressing living room.  The sound quality is so muffled and distorted I thought my speakers were  blown. And all this in the first two minutes!  I could not help but to  laugh out loud knowing I had been ripped off.  If you are thinking of  learning to play the trombone then do not get this video.  The only thing  this video will do is discourage you from being introduced to a most  wonderful and highly rewarding instrument.  Warner Bros. should be ashamed  for putting there name on this box of garbage.  Buyer be warned.",963273600,10,790,4.426573426573427
7990220,2,6305082340,"This video is strictly for beginners. It starts with taking the flute out of the case and putting it together, to some minor notes. It does cover some basic music theory, covering notes, rests, how to read basic music and  does have three songs but is not very clear in the order of notes that you  should play.  For a VERY beginner age level 3rd grade and up. It is a low  budget film even though it is from Warner Bros.",947635200,22,421,4.160493827160494
