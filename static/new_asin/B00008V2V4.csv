1862573,5,B00008V2V4,"When you think of Street Fighter you think of Ken, Ryu, Guile, Bison, all those classic characters you loved to fight as. Well now with Street Fighter 2v, fans get a chance to see the development of Ken and Ryu's powers as they are the main characters in the series. You see all the fighters from the game make appearances and you see in depth the relationship between Guile and Charlie Nash as well as Nash's iminent death at the hands of Bison. Fans also get an explanation as to the origin of the Hadou power that Ken and Ryu both posses. Fans of Chun-Li will be happy to see that she also develops a close friendship with Ryu and Ken and becomes a more prominently featured character especially towards the end of the series. Dont get your hopes up when it comes to dialogue however, because the translation from the Japanese to English doesnt do the storyline justice. But ultimately, Street Fighter 2v makes an impressive attempt to put a new and fresh aspect to the Street Fighter legend. Worth buying on DVD. My favorite episodes are the middle of the series when Ryu and Ken visit Dhalsim in an attempt to learn and master the Hadou art. The struggle that Ryu goes through to contain and master the Hadou-ken is the deeper storyline and the main one to keep an eye on. Well I'll let you viewers find out for yourselves. Go out and buy Street Fighter 2v and you will see what I mean. Gonna burn some muscle!",1123200000,,1415,4.425287356321839
1862574,4,B00008V2V4,"Overall, it was really good. But what was up with Chun Li's running shorts and knee pads? And Ryu is friends with Sagat? And Nash is really ugly and nerdy looking. And it takes a really long time for Ryu to shoot his Ha-Do-Kens and it gets really boring watching him do it over and over. And Chun Li's father didn't die? What's up with that? But anyway, I really liked the fight between Ken and Vega.

I would like to see a continuation of this story line. Bring in characters like Blanka and Honda.",1122854400,,499,4.252631578947368
1862575,5,B00008V2V4,"Ever since the street fighter 2 animated movie came out back in 1994 it has been my favorite animated movie. I must admit that i haven't seen whole collection yet but i plan to very soon. i give it a 5 just to let all first timers to the series know that there isn't a better animation out there and even though it is an old series it is still very impressive. so if you are in the middle on whether to check into this or pass it by i suggest you take a look...i don't think you will be disappointed. Buy Street Fighter II first because it really paints a good picture about what everything else will be based on, and it leaves you wanting more. You can satisfy your need for more by buying the rest of the collection.",1109721600,,718,4.099290780141844
1862576,5,B00008V2V4,"THis is what real cartoon series are all about i don't know what the other people who wrote those reviews are on but this boxset is hot,firstly i have to compare it to the fist of the north star boxset and in comparison its better in a number of ways the soundtrack is rocking and the storyline is much stronger im not a real street fighter fan and after that awful van damme street fighter film i was never gonna buy this series but im glad i did because its just stunning so if you want a manga cartoon series that you can watch again and again then this is it !!!",1101081600,2,566,4.0625
1862577,5,B00008V2V4,"If a series can get me to watch all the epsiodes back to back than that definetly says something.  Street Fighter II V has definetly done that.
The plot behind Street Fighter II V is that Ryu goes to America to visit Ken.  While there they get into a fight with a group of Air Force troops.  After Ryu and Ken victory they get...handed to them by Guile.  They then travel the world to learn new martial arts techniques and later unlock the power of the Hado.  Whie traveling they befriend Chun Li, Fei Long, Sagat, Dhalsim, and eventually Guile.  However they face deadly opponents such as Vega, Bison, Cammy, Zangief, and more.
The story is surprisngly very good, and when an Anime series last up to 30 episodes that says something (considering most barley make it to 10).  THe Animation is great, the story is great, and this is hands down the best video game to series (anime and Live) available.  Also look for background cameos from Akuma, he appears frequently in the most unusual places.",1057795200,26,994,4.576271186440678
1862578,3,B00008V2V4,"This series is based on the hit video game. It's 29 episodes long and spans four DVDs. The first three DVDs contain seven episodes each, and the fourth DVD contains eight episodes. Unfortunately, the DVDs has few extras. There are some anime DVD previews, info on other titles, links to Internet sites, and a remix of the theme song. The fourth DVD has a trailer for ""Street Fighter Alpha: The Movie"", which is unrelated to the V (""Victory"") series. Also, the DVDs (at least my copies, which I watch on my computer monitor) have an annoying flaw. Whenever the camera shot changes, the very top and very bottom of the screen has static or something. The DVDs are bilingual. The English dub is mostly accurate, but there are many differences in the dialogue. My advice is to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles first and then in English. Sometimes, I like to watch DVDs in English with English subtitles. It allows me to easily see the changes in dialogue. The ""Street Fighter II V"" DVDs don't give you that option, but I'm able to do it using the DVD Player program on my computer. One big problem that I have with the audio is that the theme song has been changed in the Japanese audio track as well. Never mess with the original audio track! As for the series itself, it's a lot better than the movie. There is room for a lot of characters. Blanka fans will be disappointed. He doesn't appear. The series takes some creative liberties, such as making Ken, Ryu, and Chun Li teenagers, but that's fine. The series is mostly about Ken and Ryu, but Chun Li is also developed nicely. Unfortunately, the final episode is mostly about Ken and Ryu's battle with Bison, leaving only a small amount of time for the ending. Several plots go unresolved. Spoilers Ahead. Does Chun Li's father survive, or does he die? This is an important part of the plot, and we'll never get an answer. We don't even see Fei Long tell Chun Li that her father is in the hospital. Does Cammy come to Chun Li and admit that she tried to murder her father? The series wastes a large amount of time with redundancies. Each episode begins with a recap of the previous episode. After that, the final scene of the previous episode is replayed and leads into the current episode. At the end of each episode, there's a preview of the next episode. On the fourth DVD, half of one of the episodes consists of a recap of previous episodes. What was the point? Also, there are lots of instances of panning camera shots of still or nearly-still pictures; Ken and Ryu charging up their special attacks; and characters running around, trying to get someplace. Near the end of the series, I was thinking ""They could've shortened this"" every minute or so. One episode could easily have been trimmed from this series without any loss in plot or characterization - perhaps more. I'm guessing that the production team was trying to make more money with less animation. If even five minutes had been cut from the final episode (which could have easily been done), then they could have added Fei Long arriving on the island and telling Chun Li about her father, Chun Li at the hospital, Cammy talking with Chun Li, simultaneous funerals for Guile's friend Nash and Chun Li's father Dorai, and Ken being reunited with his parents. Instead, the only thing that's resolved is the threat of Bison. You'd think that, with 29 episodes, they'd be able to finish what they started. Overall, this is an enjoyable series, but Chun Li (and perhaps Cammy) fans will be disappointed with the ending.",1057708800,2,3543,4.616481774960381

At first it's a bit kid friendly though by the end of disc one it really starts to amp up. Good amount of blood, fighting and every character in SFII is portrayed rather well in the series. Awesome buy indeed.",1383350400,,356,4.173913043478261

1862597,4,B00008V2V4,"Street Fighter II V is NOT a direct sequel to Street Fighter II the animated movie. Of all the Street Fighter animes this one feels the least like the Street Fighter brand. In this anime Ryu is 17 yrs old and is working with a group of lumberjacks in Japan. This is after him and Ken trained together under Gouken and have gone seperate ways. In the 1st episode Ryu receives a letter from Ken that just says 'Come to America' with some money and a plane ticket inside. After some thought Ryu decides to go to America just to find out the only reason he was called there was because his old buddy Ken just missed him. After being whooped by Guile in a bar fight and realizing that there are people much stronger than them all around the boys decide to take a world wide trip to become stronger. Their 1st stop is China where they meet the 15 yr old Chun-Li who becomes their tour guide. It's there that Ken gets a chance to fight the up and coming action star, Fei Long. After leaving China they head to Thailand where Ryu is falsely accused of trying to transport opium and is thrown in jail. It's there where he meets Sagat the Muay Thai Champion. After being released from prison, Ryu and Ken head to India where the boys are trained about Ki by a monk named Dhalsim, and then they head to Spain where they get into trouble with a bullfighter named Barlog (Vega if you watch the American dub) who sectretly works for the crime synocate, Shadow Law.
As you can see the stories of each character is a bit different from what the game presents. But it is fun to see the Street Fighter cast in a traditional-type anime. If this show is anything it's fun. And one of the best touches of the entire show is Gouki (Akuma) is a background stand in character atleast 15 times throughout the anime even though his caharacter is never actually mentioned. If you love Street Fighter and would like to see the SF cast with an actual story, or just love action/adventure animes then this one is definitely for you. A 7.5 out of 10 for me.",1303430400,4,2026,4.320209973753281
1862598,5,B00008V2V4,"Let's face it, you'll(and I did) go into this anime with 1 or 2 expectations.
1. It'll be a decent tribute show, true to the game, but nothing special.(Like Street Fighter 2 the anime movie)
2. It'll butcher the game, and be a steamy pile of garbage.(Like both Street Fighter live-action movies)

Well, you and I would be wrong on both accounts. See,whether Street Fighter game fans want to admit it or not, Street Fighter has almost no story. And the story it does have is weak. Really, the characters are great, but all we know about them is their nationality. The creators of this show realized this and made something truly special. Not only is there a very nice story here, but incredible characters, great animation, and bone-crunching action.

We start off and meet Ryu, who looks totally different from the one in the game. (I feel this was done to seperate from the game, and it works.)He receives an invitation from Ken, in America and goes, and they think they are all tough, then they get the crap beat out of them, then realize that there are stronger fighters everywhere and they should travel the world. There's also a big conspiracy with Shadowlaw, and yada yada, its good stuff. Comedy, romance, action, action, ACTION!

The characters are what I was really impressed with. I went from playing a game with 1 dimensional characters to see them come to life in this show. Bison went from Cobra Commander to Darth Vader. Vega went from that random guy I fought in a cage who is jumping around, to suave bull-fighting psychopath. You get the idea.

The music is awesome, albeit repetitive.

The animation and artwork is awesome. I love the unique character designs, and the fights just look amazing.

I'm not saying this is the greatest anime ever, but if you like martial arts shows, this is a must-own and you can get it for very cheap now. For a Manga release, it has surprisingly good picture quality.

Thanks for reading.",1292889600,3,1939,4.668621700879766
1862599,5,B00008V2V4,This is one of my favorite Anime. I first saw it in English but it is way better in Japanese. If you are at all a fan of Street Fighter you got to own this. Buy it today and you will not be disappointed.,1268438400,,203,3.6363636363636362
1862600,5,B00008V2V4,"Everyone knows the generic beat 'em ups with two fighters on the separate sides of screen. Obviously that is not a good source for a good anime without some changes and that is what happened to Street Fighter II Victory - a repetitive fighting game converted into a five-star anime. The series explains the origins of the characters of SF II: The New Challengers minus Deejay and T. Hawk. Akuma cameos are also there.

The animation itself is quality work. The graphics are nice for a mid-90's series, the casting is nice and the dubbing is even better. Every episode has a lot of happenings and there are a few cliffhangers which is nice and there are parallel stories going on, preventing the show to get boring. The last few episodes were a bit of a disappointment with all that mystic power and world domination mumbo jumbo. Overall, the fighting scenes, the characters and the story are strong points of the series.

I think this series is must for all SF fans and friends of good anime. The only bad thing about this release is the absence of the TV release openings and endings. At least the blood and violence is still there so I don't mind.",1253318400,,1149,4.545893719806763
1862601,5,B00008V2V4,"This goes perfectly as a prequel to Street Fighter 2 the animated movie. But as good as Street Fighter 2 the movie is, this collection might just have it beat. Its that good. While everything in this series isn't perfect, its so entertaining and it grabs you and pulls you in that you forget about its flaws. The story is awesome and you get to travel the world with Ryu and Ken basically as they try to master various martial arts. Once you get to the second episode, you'll be hooked and you won't be able to stop watching it until the end. After watching this, you'll feel like you literally went on a really cool life journey. The animation is top notch. The music is top notch. The story is top notch. The fights are bad a**. Buy this Collection. You won't regret it.",1247529600,3,772,4.3310344827586205

1862606,5,B00008V2V4,I loved the series and wish it had continues the alternate side story aspect I found intriquing. Like Gundam seed or wing this series sets the character up before their rise to fame. I like seeing how they began and found it to be a nice series. The animation is well done and the acting too the music can be funny sometimes but its doesnt take away from the series too much.

1862618,5,B00008V2V4,"On the heels of the success of Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie came Street Fighter II V! A series of 30 minute episodes recounting the adventures of a teenage Ken Masters and his friend from Japan Ryu.

While not directly connected to the popular animated film, it could've easily been a prelude to it as many of the things that happen during this series later happened in the film or were recounted in the film (by film I mean the animated movie, not that awful Van Damne live action flick from 1994)!

Anyway, back to the series, Ken and Ryu meet up for the first time in years when Ken invites Ryu to come to America to see him. From there, they embark on a worldwide journey to meet the best fighters and learn from them. Along the way, they learn what it means to be a true martial artist and that it doesn't always mean having the best punch or the fastest kick. I am not much on the moral stuff but some good life lessons are noted here. Nothing preachy but noted.

We also meet a very young but still pretty Chun Li and her childhood friend Fei Long (while I do like the character of Fei Long, no one is going to tell me he ISN'T copy of the late Bruce Lee, abeit a VERY GOOD copy). We also meet Sagat prior to his days of working for Bison and Shadowlaw as well as Dhalsim, Balrog, Vega, Zangief and Cammie. Guile also makes an appearance and we see why he hates Bison so much in this piece. We've heard the story of why he has it in for the Shadowlaw leader but this is the first time (that I know of) that it is actually shown. I won't give it away for those that haven't seen this version of the series but it is very telling.

As for the action, it is very good! Not quite the level of the animated movie but still very good! Overall, a very good buy!",1160438400,4,1770,4.121739130434783

1862621,1,B00008V2V4,"They made it way to drawn out and repetitive.  I mean literally repetitive.  They play the same clips over and over and over to the point that you wish you never started watching this collection.  I estimate that there is 45 full minutes of Ryu charging his Hadoken.  They didn't even bother doing different animations for this 45 minutes of repetition.  I mean it's the SAME exact scene played over and over throughout the series in slo-mo.  They also repeated the other scenes over and over making me so angry that I wanted to throw the frisbie dvd's out my window.  The storyline is not great at all.  They do not stick to the integrity of SF2.  I don't know why so many people liked it (they are probably little kids who never played SF2 in the arcades.  I would have given it 3 stars if they took out every repeated scene and the slo-motion which would have made it into a 4 hour movie instead of a 14.5 hour disaster.  SF2 generations and SF2 alpha are SO much better.  These movies are tailored for an older audience, and do not stray from the game storyline too much.  If you are 13 and don't know much about the REAL SF2 story, and love DBZ I highly recomend this to you.  For all the others, watch the two movies I mentioned above.  My favorite is Alpha (the plot is kinda like the new star wars), but generations has some awesome fighting scenes (especially the first one).",1148774400,,1384,4.372549019607843
1862622,3,B00008V2V4,"Street Fighter 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. I have yet to see an anime that has done it justice. The Animated movie came the closest, this series is second, First of all, having Ryu and Ken (and Chun Li) as teens (completely ripped and skilled at that) was a bit of a put off, but I got over that quick enough. The main problem is that they exhaust most of their good ideas early on and it starts to become a redundant mess towards the end. Guile and Charlie endless running up and down those stairs. Chun Li getting choked and Bison grinning and laughing for like, 3 whole episodes. Ryu needs a whole DVD to charge his fireball. Sagat is a good guy. Cammy's scene takes too long. Etc, etc. They get bogged down and things get stretched out DBZ style for far too long and too many characters get neglected. Ryu, Ken and then later Guile and Fei Long get the best fight scenes. Chun Li only gets one and she's not even in her right mind when it happens. The other characters are only touched upon, and a few, like E. Honda and Blanka are absent. You can tell money was getting tight towards the end, because there is a whole lot of standing around, repeated scenes and recaps. Probably only deserves a 2, but it is Street Fighter after all.",1138579200,15,1253,4.2468619246861925

1862625,3,B00008V2V4,"When this first starts, you're not exactly sure where it's going to go. You're enjoying it, but can't tell if it's going to get better or just kind of stay the same. What in fact happens, is Ken and Ryu travel to different parts of the world, and before you know it you're hooked and can't believe how good it is. It contains some of the finest moments I've ever seen in anime, and feels like it's going to climax to one of the most amazing final battles ever seen. After the third disk, there is only one more and you are fully pumped and ready for the end. However, everything goes wrong from here. The second episode on disk four has a twelve minute recap, which hints at the fact that the money has run out. Then Ryu takes about four episodes to charge his fireball which gets extremely tedious, unlike the fast pace of the earlier episodes. Before you know it, you're only two episodes away, the animation seems to have dissapeared, and the drawing style has changed. It's not even that the style has turned crap, but the animation is crap too. While earlier on, the series had moments of amazing animation, the end has awful re-used moments, that aren't even that good to begin with. It all feels like money is being saved for the final episode, the final fight, and although money comes back a bit for the final one, there is so much re-hashing of previously seen frames that you're just completely dissapointed. It drops down in quality completely, and is nothing like you expected it to be. Plus, at the end of it all, there are loose ends which are not tied up. But, if this doesn't bother you, seeing as 22 of the 28 episodes are nothing short of brilliant, and there is a final fight at the end of it all which is the ending you want for Street Fighter anyway, then by all means buy it. I would buy it just for the first 22, I just won't be watching the last 6 ever again.",1125705600,17,1884,4.309859154929577
1862626,4,B00008V2V4,"This is the Definite Street Fighter and the best video game adaption of all time. The fight between Guile and Ryu is my favourite in the film. Guile puts in a far better performance than in Street Fighter:The Animated Movie although Ryu,Ken,and Chun Li are the main stars. 4 things prevent me from giving this a 5 out of 5. Firstly the translation has been changed from the VHS versions and I think they are vastly inferior to the VHS.Secondly when M.Bison enters the scene the quality drops slightly in the 2nd half of this boxset. Thirdly the opening theme song and end credits are different here then in the VHS Version and once again its poorer. Finally If this is supposed to be a prequel to The Animated Movie. How Come Guile and Ryu don't know each other when they meet. I doubt Ryu would have 4got a battle like that. Generally though its excellent despite the minor niggles. They travel all over the world and most of the major characters appear except E.Honda,Blanka,DeeJay,and T.Hawk",1124755200,4,994,4.653409090909091

7987141,5,B00008V2V4,"i got this back when suncoast was in the fiesta mall in arizona before they took it out of the mall i love street fighter an probably am the very few who love the live action movie that first came out with jcvd . the price of this movie in the mall was 25 or 30 way cheaper from this person who is selling it or 100 wtf is that about really

the movie its self is amazing it is diffrent compare to other street fighter animes but take this into consideration this is back when they was in there teens rather then being a adult its really good and akuma is in the series but he only make cameos you can find this movie alot cheaper in other places if you just look around some",1458172800,,675,3.963235294117647
7987142,3,B00008V2V4,"If I were a still I child I may have loved this series; however, as an adult I cannot recommend this series.

Pros:
-Awesome fights
-Great soundtrack (I love that opening theme)
-Overall story (It's not terrible)

Cons:
-Character designs and story lines (These are not the Street Fighter characters I remember)
-Pacing (Really my main complaint.  About half way through the episodes started being chores to finish.  The show moves really slow in the middle portion and some parts seem to drag on.  I feel like this could have been an amazing 10 - 13 episode series if the filler was removed.)
-Ryu and Ken (They're kind of jerks in this rendition of the Street Fighter story.)

Overall:
I highly recommend that you avoid this series.  If I was still a kid with hours of extra time I may have enjoyed this, but as an adult my time is precious.  I could be watching something better with my time.",1455667200,2,895,4.55
7987143,5,B00008V2V4,I received Street Fighter II V expediently and the boxset was like new. All dvds were accounted for and it still had the poster with episode listings inside!,1447977600,,157,4.642857142857143
7987144,3,B00008V2V4,"This series started pretty strong. It had good fights, good retro 90s music, but then once you get to the part past Vega, it just starts to become flat... like a soda that's been out too long. It just got boring once you watch the heroes deal with Bison. I still haven't finished the series yet because I just got bored with it. I think I only got as far as I did because you get to see Cammy in the later episodes.",1438732800,,415,4.0120481927710845

7987146,5,B00008V2V4,"A most brilliant animated action series, I must say. For me, one of the coolest ever made next to the ghost in the shell and crying freeman dvd series. The street fighter II V collection consists of four dvds and a nice number of pretty cool and action-packed episodes on each one. The martial arts action and fight scenes in each episode of this street fighter tv animated series, I found from a point of view regarding animation and the period of the series' making, are all most highly entertaining particularly if you like martial arts animation and are any kind of fan of the street fighter movies/ gaming genre.",1427241600,,617,4.618181818181818
