3925060,1,B002GOAGNE,"This is a bad patchwork of many of the already available episodes with a hokey musical track added.  The sound quality is poor and many of the episodes have no end credits.  The set is filled out with Ralph Bellamy's ""Follow That Man"" which is lousy no matter how you slice it as is the Reed Hadley opus ""Racket Squad"" and the and the equally poor ""U.S. Treasury in Action"".  Save your money...",1376265600,11,394,4.36986301369863
3925061,5,B002GOAGNE,"I like Dragnet & for less than $10, this is a good buy. It's not a bloody/guts show & has logic that helps you to try to solve the case. The characters are caring but professional police officers. It is obvious that the show appears to have cigarette sponsors since the police smoke often but they seem to be anti-crime/pranks. The package is in a tin case with 4 DVD's--3 disks with 10 episodes each of Dragnet [all titles starting with the word ""Big""] & the 4th with other police shows that were also good. The episodes are listed below.

3925063,5,B002GOAGNE,I have been a soldier and a law enforcement officer and these films of dragnet are great. I went into police work because of these films and Adam 12. great work brings results.,1365292800,,176,4.363636363636363
3925064,5,B002GOAGNE,"I'm such a Dragnet fan.  I thought the quality was good considering how old these episodes are.  It arrived on time and in perfect condition.  The case is actually metal, giving the disks extra protection.",1356048000,5,205,4.8
3925065,5,B002GOAGNE,"My dad is a big fan of old cop and detective shows.  He watches Columbo with Peter Falk, Hawaii Five-O with Jack Lord, and Dragnet with Jack Webb.  He's a manly-man, and enjoys watching these men of action make a difference in their world (fictional as it may be).  My dad is also analitically-minded and he likes these shows because they make sense and he can try solving it before the end of the episode.  Unlike a lot of today's crime shows where you can't follow the clues because it's all about the gadgets and improbable conjecture theories versus the facts.  In Dragnet, the cops use the forensics as evidence in their case, not as a crutch.  This is a great gift for fans of crime shows young and old.",1351641600,11,709,4.415384615384616

3925067,5,B002GOAGNE,"I was amazed that early to mid 50's B/W Dragnet programs still are very much viewable. I enjoyed the scenic views, street scenes, old automobiles, clothes styles, etc. as much as the plots in the programs themselves. One can't help notice how the culture has changed. Smoking, smoking, smoking - I was almost 'choking' on the memories of how 'dirty' our workplace air used to be. I only wish that Sgt Ben Romero's few presentations could have been included. But overall, this is a very good trip down memory lane for us old-timers. The only irritant for me was the repetitive bars of music played leading in and out of each episode - which was different than what I remember as classic Dragnet music. Thank you for the good times.",1324166400,20,730,4.623076923076923
3925068,5,B002GOAGNE,I have enjoyed this collection a lot i don't get a chance too see the older dragnet tv show so it was quite refreshing too see so many episodes available of this great show.,1285718400,4,173,4.117647058823529
3925069,5,B002GOAGNE,"I love Dragnet and I loved watching every single show on this DVD set. The only thing for me was that there were only 30 episodes and the 4th disc was a bonch of other detective shows. But hey, I got the rest. Good quality for a good price !",1281916800,19,241,3.84
3925070,5,B002GOAGNE,"Watching Dragnet when it is on cable is such a treat for me... and being able to watch a whole lot of Dragnet episodes on dvd is even better!  Not sure what makes this show so watchable, whether it's the coolness of the characters, or the fact that the show is based on real cases (and you know how truth is stranger  than fiction).  It's also interesting to note how much society has changed in the years since Dragnet and other shows from this era aired.",1455148800,,456,4.27906976744186

3925072,1,B002GOAGNE,"This Chinese made (it states that on the box) is TERRIBLE! The signature Dragnet musical theme is replaced by some studio $#!+ that sounds as bad as I have described it. The transfer to DVD is as bad as I have ever seen and, on top of all of that, the episodes are all available on other discs, albeit not in the same box, that are of a much higher quality in picture and sound.

I'm selling this at a yard sale. Don't waste your money on this unless you enjoy being disappointed!!",1434585600,9,481,4.172043010752688

3925074,5,B002GOAGNE,"I love these Dragnets even more than when I saw them on TV when originally shown. They show a lost America of moral clarity and decency.

Someone here mentioned that there were 400 episodes of Dragnet made in the 1950's.  Does anyone know how to get them all? I was not a big fan of those done after this period. I wonder why Ben Alexander was dropped. I never thought Morgan, his successor, did anything but detract from the show. He had hit his peak decades earlier playing villains.",1431475200,,485,4.438202247191011

3925079,5,B002GOAGNE,"I come from a family with ties to law enforcement.  When I was a kid, I considered police people to be trusted ... after all my Dad was a volunteer officer.

The world was a very different place ... as was the way the police dealt with things.  Not everyone and their brother carried guns (including the BAD guys), the term ""serial killer"" had yet to be coined, and rape wasn't something you read about on a daily basis.

Jack Webb's Los Angeles police department was as real as he could make it.  He tried focusing on a system which worked, and did his best to humanize both the police and the people they served.  I miss the old days ... I'm sure a lot of police officers feel the same.",1415491200,3,688,4.213740458015267

So much nostalgia, dated of course by today's standards but that only adds to the pleasure, for with the simplicity of it all, that takes us back to a time when people lived to a much higher moral standard as they do now.

3925088,3,B002GOAGNE,"My wife and son gave me this for Christmas, The ""BIG"" collection would be ""Every"" Dragnet episode. There were nearly 300 originals from the 1950s and this is but a small part, I love (and loved) the show as I remember the originals in the 50s but was also disappointed the music has been dubbed over with some other theme that is NOT the classic Dragnet theme. I assume a licensing issue but was hoping for more when I unwrapped and saw the box. I give the series a five star as it is a great window to the past but the present repackaging of the series is a three star.",1388188800,5,570,4.1441441441441444

8369880,3,B002GOAGNE,"The good: Many great Dragnet and Racket Squad episodes all on 4 discs. The bad: The original Dragnet musical theme (dum-de-dum-dum.dum-de-dum-dum-dum!) has been replaced and it does not do the original justice. If you don't care about this, then this collection is fine.
