8662192,5,B00KWLKBLA,"I like this DVD volume very much and I think Dr. Breggin has infused the work of Rogers and Yelom into a workable frame that speeds the therapeutic process. Along with positive regard and heartfelt advice, that offered in a measured dose that fits the clients need at the time of presenting, the doctor demonstrate his philosophical principles in a very human way. It reminds me of my mentors approach to be present and to engage me fully. This also fits my own personal style of compassionate care to the conflicted.  God bless this clinician for his deep insight on how to move a person without pathologizing them and doping them into a zombie state.  To those who engage in talk therapies, I highly recommend you check out this mans approach as it is positive and uplifting. The people in attendance engaged the doctor with smart questions that I too appreciated getting to hear. Many times at seminars is the question seldom ever heard or repeated for the DVD audience.  This is a creative, friendly and lively approach to the healing arts and one I think is more accessible in helping folks resolve inner-struggles with decent client and solution focused methods.",1488844800,,1168,4.800995024875622
8662193,3,B00KWLKBLA,"I was disappointed in this DVD. This was because it did not give any information on how to deal with someone who is having an acute psychotic episode. As well all the ""patients"" in the presentation were all very compliant eg one of the ladies agreed to go to AA meetings but how would it have been handled if she had refused? It did not show how to handle aggressive, non-compliant or belligerent people. The empathy approach is good in some cases I would imagine. Bu I have had to deal with someone who was very depressed and not willing to do anything to help themselves or their situation. What do you do then? I was really hoping to have more info. on how to help and interact with someone who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and this DVD did not help me much at all I'm sorry to say.",1427932800,2,794,4.3
8662194,5,B00KWLKBLA,"I'd very much like to watch and learn by having more options for similar content.  Kind, hopeful, and encouraging ways to assist me in my life so that I can in turn offer others a reassuring view of the future.  These stories rang true for me.  If you buy this, my guarantee of your satisfaction is simple.  If you buy this item and do not find it worth keeping, I will pay you half of what you paid for it, up to 20 copies.  Then I will have extras for my library and to lend out from time to time.  I can be contacted about this by phone, by calling directory assistance in Seattle WA and asking by my name.",1404950400,2,609,4.033333333333333
8662195,5,B00KWLKBLA,"Not only is Dr. Breggin an incredible doctor/therapist, he is an exceptional writer. I am not a doctor, but I have found his therapeutic approach to be helpful, while remaining empathic to each individual. As a teacher of young children, I have been able to use this book as a valuable resource in working with my students exhibiting emotional distress in one way or another. I own several books that he has authored, but have to say that this is one of his finest offerings. A lay person will be guided, not intimidated by the content. His empathy shines through as does his profound knowledge of the subject matter. I highly recommend this book for everyone who has a concern for better emotional/mental health.",1402876800,3,713,4.758064516129032
8662196,5,B00KWLKBLA,"This is an excellent example of therapy at its best that is valid for professionals and everyone else!
Witness the ease and compassion of Dr. Breggin's therapy technique that can inspire us all to listening
and acting with more love and compassion in our daily lives!",1402444800,5,267,4.826086956521739
