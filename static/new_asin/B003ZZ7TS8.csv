4237417,5,B003ZZ7TS8,"I actually really enjoyed this series, I don't own many like it, as far as these kind I tend to be rather picky.
After reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot and I'm not sorry I did. I ended up buying mine used because
the price Amazon was selling for was a little high, but I trust the seller I purchased from I have bought from him
many times before and have never been let down.  So, to sum things up a bit here I recommend this anime to anyone looking
to watch a rather entertaining romantic comedy/drama series.",1305849600,6,525,4.147058823529412
8411375,5,B003ZZ7TS8,"Watched it about 10 years ago and it's still one of my favourites. I'd recommend the manga if you're interested in going in depth with the story, but if you're just looking for a cute show with a nice romance and an amazing soundtrack, this is it.",1467763200,,247,4.276595744680851

8411380,5,B003ZZ7TS8,"So I watched this last year, and I thought it was too cute. So by the time my birthday rolled around, I decided to buy it. I had read the mangas this summer, and I absolutely loved it, so I knew I had to get it.
The package itself is a cardboard sleeve, with four DVD cases inside. There are some cute special features on each disc, both dubbed and subbed are available.
The dub version kind of sucks, and the subbed presents a decent translation. The story is more fleshed out than in the manga, which tends to jump around a bit and the character's personalities fluctuate and lot. The characters have a constant personality in the anime.
It's one of my favorite animes/mangas, with unforgettable music and a brilliant mix of humor and drama.
I've seen it twice now, and I will watch it over and over.",1407456000,,802,4.389261744966443
8411381,5,B003ZZ7TS8,"I have always enjoyed the series when watching it on the internet. But then after moving, we got directv, and the internet is limited each month. In which if I were to watch 5 episodes, all the internet would be gone for the month that we can use that isn't charged extra.
Happy I finally bought the series. The disks and cases are in very good shape. I'm very pleased with that I get to see this awesome yaoi series again. (Yaoi=Boy love)",1401840000,,439,4.301204819277109
8411382,1,B003ZZ7TS8,"I bought this for my daughter after reading the other reviews. They made it sound like a romantic comedy. It is, but with adult theme. I have found before that the reviews were helpful but not this time. I was let down. I'm glad I screened it beforehand. That was way too much money to throw away.",1393804800,,297,4.228070175438597
8411383,3,B003ZZ7TS8,"Cute anime, but I was never really able to be drawn into the story and care about the characters.  FYI - all in standard screen size (3x4)",1392595200,,138,4.111111111111111
8411384,5,B003ZZ7TS8,Great series love the story line and music and I am so happy to have the full collection in one great set.,1390262400,,106,3.8636363636363638
