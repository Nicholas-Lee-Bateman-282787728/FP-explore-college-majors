8276518,2,B001AAT9T2,"I bought this movie because I am a fan of Rod Taylor.  He obviously needed to make a quick buck at the time this film was released.  A poorly filmed and poorly dubbed mercenary action film.  This film is good for an occasional laugh, however I would avoid it at all costs.",1331769600,,272,4.1923076923076925
