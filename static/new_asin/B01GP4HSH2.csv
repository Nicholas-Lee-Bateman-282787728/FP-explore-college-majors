7764388,4,B01GP4HSH2,"I find this to be one of the better films of 2016 so far - and I say this as someone who isn't typically a mainstream filmgoer. The film is not really about a 'Hologram for the king'  but instead about a man [Hanks] going through a mid-life crisis of sorts. A man who's life and business are failing but who in a completely foreign land begins to find himself. There's light humor, an engaging narrative that takes some interesting turns, good acting along with occasional inventive camera work and editing [as is to be expected from the director of Run Lola Run]. Perhaps I had low expectations and liked it better than I thought I would? Nonetheless, I did enjoyed it and would watch it again.",1469664000,6,695,4.47244094488189
7764389,2,B01GP4HSH2,"I hard to imagine how such great actors were coaxed into this light-hearted ineffective fluff that's neither a comedy nor a drama, and while it features some fine footage of exotic lands far away has about as little plot as you can get away with for 90 minutes. If you've seen the trailer, you'll know this is a clash of cultures flick that hints at redemption for a failed businessman, foreign love interests and the feel good factor of making new friends in distant lands. It does all of these things in the most tangential way possible, with a 60-second Talking Heads opener, and whirlwind romance with a doctor and a relationship with a Saudi driver.

Tom Hanks is excellent as always and without him it would be an unwatchable mess. But even he struggles to work with the collapsing chair running joke, and extract drama from the injected relationship problems with his ex-wife and daughter. There are many scenes that could be cut, many underdeveloped plot lines that go nowhere, and zero conflict save for a boss who occasionally pressures the hero to do his job. I heard the original book is good but this is very rough translation that can't hold it together despite the obvious talent of its stars.",1467504000,4,1208,4.69811320754717
7764390,4,B01GP4HSH2,"""A Hologram For the King"" (2016 release; 97 min.) brings the story of Alan Clay (played by Tom Hanks). As the movie opens, we see Alan sing the Talking Heads song ""Once In A Lifetime"" (...with a beautiful house, and a beautiful life... how did I get here?). Turns out Alan was dreaming as he's really on a plane headed to Saudi Arabia, where he and his sales team are to pitch a major IT sale to the King himself. (Only later do we understand what connection Alan has to the King.) Alan is not adjusting well upon his arrival, and in fact oversleeps the next morning. In a panic, Alan hires a car and driver to take him to the King's Metropolis of Economy & Trade, site of the new project. At this point we're less than 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of Daved Eggert's bet-selling (and critically acclaimed) book of the same name. I have not read the book, so I cannot comment how closely (or not) the movie sticks to the book. The movie is written and directed by Tom Tykwer, the German director best known for Run Lola Run, and some years ago The International. Here he tackles the familiar ""fish out of water"" theme of an American being in unfamiliar territory and culture. When I saw the opening scene with the Talking Heads song, and we then dive straight into Saudi Arabia, the question of course is how the Tom Hanks character got to that particular point in his life (we later learn in flashback glimpses). I thought the first hour of the movie worked really well, and reminded me somehow in a general of Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"". The movie falters when the (inevitable?) potential romantic interest develops between the Tom Hanks character and his doctor (yes, a female doctor in Saudi Arabia!). when he develops a bad cyst on his back. Tom Hanks remains an enjoyable actor to watch, and develops a great chemistry with Alexander Black (in the role of the driver/guide). The movie is shot beautifully (Morocco and Egypt stand in for Saudi, although there is some very interesting footage from Mecca as well).

""A Hologram for the King"" opens last month at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The screening I saw this at was reasonably well attended, and judging from the crowd's reaction, most of them really enjoyed the movie. This looks like it could have some legs in the theater, assuming word-of-mouth builds. If you are interested in foreign cultures, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1465948800,25,2666,4.622362869198312
7764391,2,B01GP4HSH2,"A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING, Tom Hanks. A failing American businessman (Tom Hanks as Alan Clay) looks to recoup his losses by traveling to Saudi Arabia, selling his idea to the wealthy king. This international production is set in the near future, in 2010.  It is apparently based on a Dave Eggers story, with screen play by Eggers and Tom Tykwer, who also directed.  It appears to be a multi-country production, though there are a lot of  Russian names attached to it.  It is supposedly set in Saudi Arabia, though it was largely filmed in Morocco, with only exteriors filmed in Saudi, appears to be a propaganda vehicle for Saudi Arabia.  It follows the old British formula for a film its makers hoped would succeed in the American market: international cast, hire one big American star.  Tom Hanks. It was a major flop.

Hanks, of course, carries it easily.  He is a fine actor, wasted here.  Hes won two back to back big Oscars, in 1995, Best Actor in a Leading Role for FORREST GUMP, in 1994, Best Actor in a Leading Role for PHILADELPHIA. Hes received three more Oscar nominations, won any number of other awards. Sarita Chaurdry, who debuted in the 1991 MISSISSIPPI MASALA, plays Dr. Zahra, his love interest.  She channels a part in THE SECOND BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL. Tom Skerrit plays Ron, Alans father; Tracey Fairaway is Kit, his daughter. The much-praised young actor Ben Whishaw, (SKYFALL, SPECTRE) is wasted  in a small part.  Alexander Black plays Yousef, Alans frequent driver, channeling a part in WHISKEY FOXTROT TANGO. The film accurately portrays a lot of desert, a lot of modern rush rush construction, a lot of money and power among the moneyed classes, and none below.  Also the illegality of any kind of alcohol: beer, wine, whisky.  Unfortunately, while we heard Hanks loud and clear, we had a lot of trouble with the approximated Arabian accents.

It may be Hanks only flop; it must be  his biggest. The film opened in the U.S. on April 24, 2016, made $138,605 its opening weekend. Topped out at $3, 424, 519.  I really disliked this film, for itself. And other reasons; on Monday, the very day I saw it in our local art house, BBC News reported that Qatar had convicted a Dutch woman of against-the-sharia law sex outside marriage and deported her, though she had claimed she was raped: her native co-respondent was lashed. The same article reported that Saudi Arabia had recently sent a Norwegian woman to jail for six months for the same offense, lashed her partner. In real life, the love affair of Dr. Zahra and Alan Clay might have had some unpleasant results.  Seems to me its best if a film does not fly in the face of reality.",1465948800,8,2661,4.67381974248927

A terrific man, IMHO. This is supposed to be a comedy. It's not. Sure, there are funny moments in it, endearing moments, and dramatic moments as well. It's a movie about the journey of ""Alan"" a failed American sales rep. He ends of going to Saudi Arabia, and the journey continues from there. I honestly hope you will open your mind to watching this. Some thought goes into this movie, others would confirm boring, but in my world it was a thought out tale.",1530403200,,617,4.421052631578948

The marriage, the daughter, the recession, Schwinn, and the sales job were all pressures and failures he deeply felt and could not rise above.  I thought the setting was interesting, and the last quarter of the movie was a total surprise to me. Without that final experience, this was a doomed man.  I was not expecting much since I had never heard of this movie even though it starred Tom Hanks, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I loved it.  I especially liked the business aspect of it and how relevant it is in today's global economic environment, and the social aspect was just as interesting.

He gets there but keeps missing the shuttle to get to the place where the rest of his team is, and he ends up getting a driver, Hassan, who is a likeable and interesting driver, with a situation of his own(he's having an affair/flirtation with a young wife of a very older man). Clay meets with his team, but they encounter problems and the point of contact who is there for them, is not in town. However, with persistence and pluck, he eventually gets the things he needs as well as eventually as an audience with King Abdullah. While he is there, he finds he has a lump on his back so he goes to the doctor, where the doctor is a she(Sharita Chowdry) and reserved, He also goes into the mountains where Hasan is from and has an interesting time as well as a tour of Mecca(by mistake).

When Yousef says he studied in Alabama, you immediately remember a certain other Hanks character who did the same. When Hanks has to fix problems with his crew of three people isolated with no signal it's analogous to Apollo 13. When Hanks doesn't shoot the wolf, remember how he let the German soldier go free in Saving Private Ryan. When Hanks confronts a receptionist named Maha who can't give him any answers think how close her name is to the word NASA (Apollo 13). When Hanks and his Doctor begin flirting over e-mail? Sleepless in Seattle. The painting above the Doctor's fireplace has a familiar design on it similar to the package Hanks held onto in Castaway. When Hanks is told by Yousef to look away from the mosque he looks down at his shaking hands and again we see Saving Private Ryan. When Hanks and the Doctor are swimming I remember Splash. When Yousef asks him if he'd help with a rebellion? Charlie Wilson's war. The lump on his back? Philadelphia. Not killing the wolf was reference to when he let the enemy soldier go in Saving Private Ryan. The chairs slipping out from under him are reference to The Money Pit. I could go on and on.  Road to Perdition, The Green Mile, and Big are also referenced.

No real buildups, no real reason actually for making this film unless you are on a hospital bed in intensive care and have nowhere else to go and don't want to get excited about anything.

I can credit the movie by saying it sheds some real light into the world and how it really is in Saudi Arabia... I was surprised that they got away with showing some things they did as it does not shed a good light on the kingdom.

I think the film mirrors the slow, ponderous, circuitous route of real life so well that one feels compelled to follow along.  Like eavesdropping on a stranger's conversation.

7764642,5,B01GP4HSH2,"What a difference a small screen makes! I originally saw this in the theatre and felt it was slow moving and went nowhere. Then, a year later, I decided to download it since it was a free Prime Video, and I was blown away by it. I suppose the introspective nature of the story and the pacing simply work better on a small screen, and since you're watching it at home, you can always pause it when needed, so you never feel like the story drags.

Tom Hanks plays Alan Clay, a middle-aged father who's been financially struggling to support his daughter ever since he made a bad decision to outsource the jobs at the Schwinn bicycle factory to Chinese workers. Not only did the Chinese workers do the work more cheaply, but the Chinese management copied the company's product and took over the business as well, putting Clay out of a job. This irony is just one of a series of ironies for our sad-sack hero, who resembles Bill Murray in ""Lost in Translation"" but is far worse-off.

I thought the cab driver character who keeps helping Clay out of a jam felt like a stereotype, the wisecracking native who becomes the tour guide for the white hero, but the love affair between Clay and the reserved Muslim doctor felt compelling and natural, which was a relief. The underwater scenes were beautiful and you really felt Clay's pain.

This film really seems made for an older audience and asks viewers to look at themselves, which explains why it flopped at the Cineplex. It's really too bad because these types of introspective, quiet films are few and far between, and yet they leave you with a more profound understanding of life than a dozen of those shoot-them-up, blow-them-up blockbusters and mindless superhero movies you see advertised everywhere.",1498003200,10,1751,4.697068403908795

You could say it's Willy Loman as T.E. Lawrence before he became Lawrence of Arabia except his boss wants him to retire, his ex-wife wants him out of their daughter's life, and his daughter just wants him in her life more, preferably with money to pay for college.

The movie is built on several highly unlikely scenarios such as a female Saudi doctor who treats men, a Saudi driver/tour guide, a female receptionist, an American with a drinking problem who is not kicked out of the country, etc.

Supposedly, the author & the director have both been to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia where the story takes place and yet they didn't know something as basic as all of the Embassies are in Riyadh though a lot of countries, including the USA, have Consulates in Jeddah.

Most doctors and nurses in Saudi Arabia are foreigners.  There are women doctors for women, but it would be extremely unusual for a female doctor to treat a man.

It would also be very unusual for a Saudi man to act as a driver and tour guide.  Again, foreigners would do such a job.

Also, a drunken orgy at the Danish Ambassador's house is extremely unlikely, but apparently Hollywood thought this movie needed sexing up.  Open snorting of cocaine is unbelievable.

Disclosure:  I lived/worked in Riyadh for two years & spent time in Jeddah.  Saudi Arabia's culture is very different from the USA's though Americans built or influenced most of the infrastructure so almost all American fast food joints & other businesses are there.

The movie did at least hint at how hospitable, polite, and charming Saudis can be",1497398400,6,1770,4.652733118971061

Spoilers follow:  ""This movie can simply be summed up by saying a recently divorced sales person tries his luck in international sales and fails...but finds a new relationship with a local female doctor, thus making the trip worth his time.  He then decides to take a job selling high end condos to stay close to his new relationship interest.""  The character that Tom Hanks plays is by far barely even interesting.  The character is a divorced, high anxiety, ill prepared sales person with erection issues attempting to sell hologram equipment to the Saudi King; who is supposed to identify with this character?

In every Tom Hanks movie in existence, Tom plays the exact same character, a strong, decent, vulnerable, emotionally honest man of politically liberal beliefs but conservative instincts, a man who trusts his gut without ignoring his brain, a man guided by his own generosity, which he practices regardless of the consequences. The reason why we never tire of seeing such a character onscreen is that they appear few and far between in real life. However, a Tom Hanks character in any of his movies (pick one) would remind us that such is not the case, that if you remove the walls of prejudice, there's a bit of Tom in everyone.",1497225600,2,777,4.720588235294118

The best part was the Tom Hanks' character's near breakup psychologically.  Very well done and intriguing.  Also good: the arrogant way the Saudis would keep jerking him and his team around.
The bad: the Hanks character was incredibly oblivious to the realities of Saudi culture.  This is a guy who was supposed to have international experience.  True, I've met and worked with some totally oblivious idiots overseas, so I know they exist, but they aren't the material one uses for the main character in a film. Especially with the awareness of the Middle East since 9/11.
More bad: he made such a crisis out of a lipoma on his back - this is a very common issue, and the removal is no big deal - is often/usually done in a doctor's office, with local anesthetic.

Perhaps we've had relationships that have not turned out as we expected. Maybe, just maybe is all of this, there is new life, there are some new possibilities. These are the themes in this movie, and if you are interested in an honest portrayal of them, you will love it.",1495929600,14,694,4.56

I truly felt like a tourist and actually learned a few things with the Arabian culture - no joking allowed - some individuals may take things literally sometimes; non-Muslims are not allowed to see the Holy City; women not allowed to be alone with a male; and much more. It was so refreshing to see how business is run in a very new city --- I was awed of how expansive the rooms were: hotels, lobbies, operating room - everything is so huge due to a lot of land to spread out.  It actually had me mentally asking more questions in how they run things in their country. At last but not the least, it was so refreshing to see an unexpected (spoiler warning!) romance developing - I really didn't see that coming and I'm quite skilled in predicting plots --- what was refreshing was it's for 50 years old lovers --- finally humans around my age-- usually Hollywood movies just show teenagers or very young adults which I'm so bored of now, enough of these immature perky high schoolers frollicking around - the tenderness, the realness was authentic looking. Well done Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast mates... thank you for the great story.",1495584000,17,1271,4.478448275862069
7764755,5,B01GP4HSH2,"Excellent film. It is very well-done with the story line being one which is quite intriguing. The story is very believable. A middle-aged man who is suffering from anxiety due to the pressures of his life. His struggles lead him to places he never dreamed about and offer him a solution if he is willing to accept it. He does and it becomes quite a tender moment. The reality of the entire situation ever occurring in real life is remote, but one feels the sense of danger he is encountering actually allowing him to be set free, which makes the story more plausible.

This film is one of the sleepers we sometimes encounter. Hanks produces and stars in so many films that it is difficult to believe one man can do so much with so little time available. However, he takes with him the qualities, to each film and story, which have made him the finest actor of our time. It is difficult to imagine anyone else in the roles he takes on, and it is equally hard to imagine anyone else producing and/or directing the many films and TV programs he's been involved interwoven with an acting career.

Hanks has handled many ""sleeper"" films in his illustrious career, including the likes of ""Cloud Atlas"" and ""The Green Mile"" and ""Charlie Wilson's War"" among others... all of which are classics and must-see films. ""A Hologram For The King"" is one of these films.

I am sure many people sometimes tire of seeing another Hanks piece in the theaters or on TV, but his work is so bloody good that we should be pleased rather than bored or even upset.

This film was actually produced in Germany, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. The scenes in the desert do not depict what the crews and actors underwent in such desolate heat. I've heard it was very tough on them, but they made it through and completed a wonderful film studying the angst and anxieties of a middle-aged man who faces his fears and becomes the man he always wished to be.

Congrats to everyone on the production team. It is an excellent film.",1495584000,59,1990,4.516666666666667

A realistic non-Hollywood look at a very exotic culture and the foreigners living in it. Also an interesting cameo of the life of an educated Saudi woman doctor and what she faces in dating a foreigner. It makes a pertinent comment on American business practices without that being it's central theme. I had the feeling that I was on a trip to Saudi Arabia while watching the film. One of the best films we have watched in months. No violence. It's sweet, funny, human, touching, romantic. Both the husband and I watched it together and we loved it.

7764760,3,B01GP4HSH2,"Tom Hanks plays a divorced businessman trying to make decent money in Saudi Arabia representing an IT company so that he can earn enough money to send his daughter to college.  Saudi Arabia is a uniquely strange country (I was there for Desert Storm), and some of the hypocrisies are shown here if you can catch them:  vices are hidden from the public, laborers are Filipino (or Pakistani), women must be veiled, Christians should not mingle with Muslims, and Saudis do not live or work by a clock:  ""Tomorrow"" means any time after today.  Tom Hanks as Alan Clay has to learn all that, while his IT team is relegated to a windy tent with no real food or AC while the host nation employees and everyone else is nearby in a new building with all the amenities.  It's a culture clash and the Americans are suffering.

The movie moves along at an almost slow pace.  Some scenes feel like repeats like in Groundhog Day: he keeps oversleeping for the hotel shuttle, the king is never there, and he keeps getting blown off by the Saudi partners. For me the best part of the movie was the relationship between Yousef, his hotel-contracted driver  (Alexander Black, who's not quite convincing as a Saudi) and  Alan, and how it developed. Yousef teaches him about the weird Saudi ways, and a friendship of trust develops. So because of this, I found the ending with the doctor rather unrealistic and disappointing.  I like most Hank movies, but this one will be just OK.",1495411200,13,1460,4.602316602316602

This guy isn't shot,  or tortured,  he fumbles a few times,  but his good intentions carry him through.  Much like most of real life.  The Arabs are real people too,  not cartoons.

This movie doesn't OVER-strive on any one point but you see the obvious cultural differences and the way he is slightly unaffected by them. In fact, one might say he's a bit reckless about it, but again, the movie doesn't push the point too far, but it's still there. Central to the story is that he is selling an innovative technology at a period in his career where he needs something a little bigger to happen. This in some ways is also consequential w/regard to his college age daughter of whose mother he is no longer married to. Getting the deal, means waiting on others and literally sweating it out on the desert sands of Saudi Arabia where he, his team and their company serve at the pleasure of the King and the people Hanks is liaising with in order to demonstrate the technology. His is the first team there to do so but since I don't want to spoil anything here, I'll leave the rest of the story for you to enjoy.

7764772,5,B01GP4HSH2,"In my opinion, I have never seen a bad movie performance by Tom Hanks.  The man has charisma, charm, confidence, benevolence, wise humor, and sex appeal!  I loved this film as a portrayal of a man's journey (like each of our own) in which he must face his internal demons, work through them, and come out the wiser of himself and the world in the end.  The setting in Saudi Arabia was beautiful; the cultural contrast and the supporting characters were just right.  Tom Hanks' ""love interest"" played a great role, as well; both characters acted their roles with just the right amount of shy and cautious anticipation, which made for  for cerebral, sensual and sexual tension; I'm a romantic!.  It left me hopeful and with a lesson to learn.  This movie is about self realization, and little bit about the underdog in all of us.  So if you're looking for inspiration to boost your own path to becoming a better you, then perhaps you'll enjoy watching ""A Hologram for the King"".",1495152000,32,976,4.633720930232558

Third, I do wish that the director and writer(s) of this film would have showcased how being a global business leader who travels regularly affects one's life, but that of their families too.

When it came to the part where he started to fall for the local Saudi physician, I thought 'oh brother' as if that would be his type.  Maybe I was seeing too much of Tom Hanks in that part.

It's a bizarre surrealistic movie, weird things happen or are shown and never explained.

The ending felt completely unrealistic (but of course why would I expect realistic when nothing much about the movie was realistic?) and pat.

I didn't think the movie had a message or much of a plot, or at least it was certainly lost on me. It's only thought provoking as in what the h--- is going on? What was that all about? or, Really???

7764785,3,B01GP4HSH2,"Tom Hanks plays a fish-out-of-water businessman in this tale of culture shock, self-doubt and discovery. Set amidst the flat desert plains of Saudi Arabia, Hanks aims to mend his financial struggles by selling an absentee king on a gimmicky hologram-driven teleconferencing solution. Along the way, he encounters no shortage of roadblocks, be they personal, bureaucratic, cultural or medical, and eventually recognizes it as a growth opportunity. This is a conflicted picture, much in the same way our leading man plays a conflicted individual. Nailing down a steady tone seems difficult; the film opens with a loose, cartoonish musical number, then settles into a fast-paced corporate shuffle before cutting that loose and becoming a warm-hearted buddy picture and, finally, a contemplative romance. All this in a very trim, quick ninety minutes. Social norms are a steady focus, shining a flashlight on the immense gap between everyday life as an American and as a Saudi, but in the end it feels like those are only superficial, easily brushed aside to make way for a happy ending. That climax leaves us with dozens of loose ends, half-heartedly explored threads that are inspected and discarded like an inattentive child digging through his toybox. It all feels very loose and light, like we've read a summary but not the entire story. There's a compelling yarn buried somewhere within A Hologram for the King, but we only skim the surface.

The extras include the usual Making Of, a look at how the Dave Eggers' novel was adapted to the screen with the author himself commenting on stuff next to the director in much of these two extras. The last was showing how the on-set Saudi cultural liaison helped the movie reflect as close to Saudi culture as possible (oh, and there's also the, of course, decadent Western expat underground party life depicted as well).",1487462400,,723,4.604651162790698

For these people, it provides a way to pass time. For everyone else, it feels like the person who insists on driving you by their childhood home & wants to spend hours explaining it to you.  Hanks is a great actor, but the subject matter is incredibly boring and mundane. IMHO, the title of the movie is intentionally ambiguous (""A Hologram for the King""). It could more aptly be called ""Trying to Sell a Video-Conferencing System to Some Saudi Bureaucrat"".  In an era of ubiquitous SnapChat, Skype, NetMeeting and similar apps, the movie's technology seems dated and quaint (maybe the script was based on a 1960's book).",1480636800,3,778,4.7555555555555555

7764905,3,B01GP4HSH2,"Tom Hanks stars again as the everyman in this unusual film by Tom Tykers from Dave Eggers best-selling novel.  Alan Clay (Hanks) was once a rising star in the hierarchy of Schwinn bicycles, a very successful American company.  He was also instrumental in the decision to manufacture the bikes in China, putting thousands of Americans out of work.  Eventually leaving that company he is now a marketing director for a high tech firm trying to sell holographic communications systems.  Hes sent to Saudi Arabia to make a pitch to the King for a new project in the middle of the desert.

It comes at an inopportune time as Alan is going through a divorce.  To make matters worse, hes making much less money and has had to pull his adorable and understanding daughter, Kit (Tracey Fairaway) out of college.  Now if you are heading to the KSA, you might want to bone up on the culture and its differences from America.  But Alan doesnt seem to know that booze is forbidden (although it seems to be readily available), women are subservient and Hyatt hotels have wake-up service available.  Granted Alans time lag is an issue but he thinks a bottle of vodka will make it all better.

In the end, the story is about Alans coming to grips with a new life and about an unexpected romance.  At first with a helpful and attractive intermediary between the Danish consulate (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and the Kingdom.  She would seem to be what the doctor ordered.  Attractive, age-appropriate and interested.  But she is just too aggressive I guess for Alan, who by his own admission hasn't had sex for a long time.  But later, after an ill-fated and drunken attempt to lance a golf ball size growth on his back, Alan meets a real doctor in Zahra (Sarita Choudhury) who is assigned to his case.  Also in the midst of a divorce, she takes a distant liking to her patient, and wellsome things transcend cultural differences.

If the romantic aspects of the film are what the storytellers are going for, they certainly do plenty of zig-zagging to get you there.  For example, the daily confrontation with the Saudi princes receptionist where his appointments are never fulfilled.  His constant oversleeping which prompts him to summons a Saudi Uber-like driver named Yousef (Alexander Black) and his mid 70s generic General Motors sedan.  This in a country where everyone seems to drive an exotic sports car or Rolls Royce.  Still, the scenes with Yousef are some of the best.  But when Alan accepts Yousefs invite for a weekend in his desert home town, they and the rest of the clan decide to go wolf hunting.  What the hell was that all about?

In the end, Hologram is a modestly entertaining vehicle for Hanks who is good as usual.  The film never really draws you in however.",1476921600,,2761,4.6902286902286905

It meanders all over the place, goes around itself over and over, then ends abruptly. By the time the film was over I was left with a bad feeling of frustration, inadequacy, and being lost. Even though it had a happy ending! So I do not recommend this movie in any way. Steer clear.",1476057600,3,486,4.236559139784946
7764937,3,B01GP4HSH2,"A Hologram for the King took in a tiny $7.7 million at the box office on a budget of $30 million.  That may or may not say something about the worth of the film but we cannot say that this won took the theaters by storm.  It made the least of any Tom Hanks film in about 30 years.  But should we watch it anyway and the box office be dammed?  Yep.  Any time we have Tom Hanks on screen we should watch him.
  The story winds around and around while we get to know the Hanks character, a salesman suffering frustration on top of frustration as he tries to get a giant contract in Saudi Arabia.  While there are some typical third world problems, missed appointments, bad internet connections, a sense that no one is in charge he faces problems unique to the country.  His big sale is meant to connect a new business city rising in the desert.  But the city is more of a dream than a reality.  He is trying to sell a hologram system for business meetings to an enterprise that for all intents and purposes is a mirage.  A tough sell.
  But the last third of the film switches gears and we get a very adult--not dirty, just very mature and grown up--love story between the salesman and his Saudi lady doctor.  That I thought worked very well on a story basis and on an acting basis.  His love interest is Sarita Choudury, lately seen on the very popular Homeland on TV.  She and Hanks do very well together as mature people who take the chance fate has served up to have a little happiness.
  Tom Tykwer wrote and directed from a novel by David Eggers.  Hanks also worked under the German born Tykwer on the many many times more successful Cloud Atlas.
  The bad things in the story bring down the average in terms of stars.  There is no way in the world that a lady doctor would serve a man in Saudi Arabia.  In one scene the doctor and the male patient are alone.  One or more probably both of them would be killed out of hand in such a situation.  A male doctor was murdered recently for aiding in a difficult birth when no lady doctor was able to attend, so this stuff does still happen over there.  Such cultural miss-references jar the viewer.  For some reason an Anglo American, Alexander Black, was cast as a Saudi driver and companion to the salesman.  He was a constant visual distraction to the flow of the story.
  The film had Saudi Arabia as the setting but the filming took place in Egypt and Morocco, for obvious reasons.",1475971200,3,2434,4.295154185022026

But okay, let me try anyway . . . at an abstract level.

One principle of story-telling is that each individual character and event needs to contribute to some over-arching purpose.  If you can remove a character or event without noticeably affecting that purpose, then that character or event shouldn't be there in the first place.

Now . . . this move has a very poorly defined purpose.  There might be 3 or 4 candidates for what that purpose actually is.

But whatever it happens to be . . . at least 50% of the movie's characters and events can't conceivably be imagined to contribute to it.

The title of the movie (?) Doesn't have anything to do with any purpose.
The car driver comedy ""relief"" (?) Doesn't have anything to do with any purpose.
A scene set in Mecca (?) Doesn't have anything to do with any purpose.
A fight scene in a building under construction (?) Doesn't have anything to do with any purpose.

I was thinking this was going to be a comedy and there are some funny moments early on but in reality this becomes more of a romantic drama with a really nice love story.  The funny moments are more of the light humor variety but the comedic timing between Clay (Hanks) and his driver (Black) is very good.  Having lived overseas, I could relate to being in a completely different culture that what I was use to and the inevitable culture clash that you face being overseas like the character in this movie faces.  I am not familiar with the book that this is based so I cannot say how well the book is adapted to the movie.  Hanks is good as always as is Black and the beautiful Sarita Choudhury.  The landscape, even though it is mostly desert is nicely done with some nice scenery among the desert.  The story itself seems a bit aimless at times, especially in the beginning, and there are some stretches that made me wonder where this movie was going.  I can understand why some people didn't like the movie but it is one of those types of movies that if you hang in there, you will find a nice love story.  Maybe I understand this movie more because I have been in a similar situation living overseas and trying to find my way in a relationship that has cultural differences.  Either way, I enjoyed the movie and thought it was worth watching.

7765253,3,B01GP4HSH2,"Director Tom Tykwer (Cloud Atlas, 3, Run Lola Run) adapted Dave Eggers popular novel A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING for the screen and proceeded to direct it with a fine cast who try to hold together a story that is for the most part uninteresting. It does, however, give us some insights into life in Saudi Arabia, Muslim traditions, and the influence of China taking over most global projects from the rest of the entrepreneurial world.

Since there is not much story, it is summarized as a failed American sales rep Alan (Tom Hanks) looks to recoup his losses (form the collapse of Schwinn begin taken over by the Chinese after a concept to make more money by outsourcing the bicycle manufacturing) by traveling to Saudi Arabia and selling his company's product  holograms as an entrepreneurial concept to build influence and income - to the wealthy King of Arabia. Most of the film is Alans frustration with the politics of Arabia (no one is ever where they promise to be), missing shuttles out to the middle of the desert where his companys plan is to be utilized in building a megapolis and using the same Uber driver Yousef (Alexander Black) to provide his tangled transportation. His companys presentation space is a makeshift tent (where his crew await Alans arrival  David Menkin, Christy Meyer, Megan Maczko) about which Alan is frustrated yet unable to change things. Alan notices a lump on his back, seeks the attention of a doctor (Sarita Choudhury) who treats him well and eventually forms a shrouded affair with Alan, ultimately presents his hologram (Ben Wishaw  in a 30 second appearance) to the kings rep Karim Al-Amad (Khalid Laith) and ultimately to the king  but of course it all is for naught because the Chinese underbid the project and promise faster results.

Too many sidebars, a little sex, a nice view of deserts if that is your choice of landscapes, and in many ways a waste of talent, A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING slipped out the short theater run for a good reason. Strictly for Tom Hanks devotees. Grady Harp, August 16",1471046400,2,2040,4.748587570621469

7765261,1,B01GP4HSH2,Starts well but gets increasingly slow and boring.  I had never heard of this movie and now I know why.  Don't waste your time or money.,1470700800,5,136,4.1923076923076925
7765262,5,B01GP4HSH2,"I read the book a while back.  I've been a fan of Dave Eggers for some time, so I enjoyed the movie for what it was based on.  The reason why I gave it 5 stars is because 1) they brought the moments that stuck with me from the book into the film 2) things are very close to how I imagined them 3) there wasn't a moment when I hoping that a particular scene (Maybe the boat, but that was short lived) from the book would make an appearance in the movie and then let me down.

The romantic part of the story is bold and it may upset some who are sensitive, people who tend to tie everything they read or watch to the facts and opinions surrounding ""real life,"" or people who have difficulty enjoying stories for what they are: fictional.",1470355200,120,735,4.090277777777778
7765263,3,B01GP4HSH2,"Alan Clay (Tom Hanks) a former CEO for Schwinn and now an IT salesman, sells his home and travels to Saudi Arabia to pay for his daughter's (Tracey Fairaway) education, because parents now feel obligated to do so. He is to do the IT work for a city under construction. He has a ""team"" of three people and they are to present to the King of Saudi Arabia a hologram presentation to demonstrate their capability, something that was lost to the near drama of the film.

The film started out with Tom Hanks ""singing"" a modified version of ""Once in a Lifetime"" as he heads off to Saudi Arabia as a stranger in a strange land. He has trouble coping with the culture and customs but lands on his feet.

Hanks tries, but is unconvincing in a half-hearted script that spins its wheels in the desert.

7765264,5,B01GP4HSH2,"I liked this film... a lot. This is just the right time for a gentle musing on America past, present, and future. An businessman, a former Schwinn executive beaten down by the rosy memories of a past when, as Mr. Trump would say, America was great, now finds himself going thru a divorce, and is unable  to pay his daughters college tuition. In a desperate last attempt to reclaim his grip on that vision, he takes an ill prepared trip to Saudi Arabia, to sell a fancy state of art holographic virtual conferencing system. But past hi-tech dreams haven't quite lived up to expectations in the kingdom as it is,,, sand as far as the eye can see where a city will supposedly stand decades from now... if ever.... Which is the real mirage?

On his trip, Alan meets some Saudis and learns he actually has more in common with them than not. Separated only by the merest filament...  His daughter will adapt, and globalization is an unfortuate fact of life, but he has let go of past dreams and found a new place to fit in.",1469836800,8,1017,4.427807486631016
