540272,4,6303051618,"Surprisingly better than I had predicted. I found it written well with good plot twists.

I am copying then modifying another review since I don't do this often:
A thriller about high school guys and phone pranking gone wrong.
The intensity of this film and the suspense was pretty good.
Although, for a while I had to ask myself how is ""Mr Lee"" controlling everything in the house... power, 911 calls, etc still it kept the drama going.
In the end it was not too hard to find the killer though as you knew it had to be a previous victim.
All in all decent!",1523404800,,557,4.304761904761905

540526,4,6303051618,"It's not a good movie by any means.
But is it fun to watch? Absolutely.

It's over the top in almost all of the right places. It's laughably predictable, good, 90's-esque, slasher horror fun. The acting, for such a horrible script, was surprisingly competent, and I can see these people acting in serious films. What tickled me the most was the lack of technical details of how someone can re-route someone's phone calls from 9-1-1 to literally any number. Just believe it, okay? It's movie magic.

Honestly, it was fun. Dumb fun. Not great fun, just dumb fun. Watch when you want to kill some brain cells and enjoy yourself at the same time.",1520812800,,642,4.62280701754386
540527,5,6303051618,"To say much about this movie is to ruin the shocking plot twists. This is an original in the suspense genre and is a ""you haven't seen anything quite like this"" like ""Texas Chainsaw"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Halloween"" (the original, not the POS Rob Zombie abominations), and ""Psycho"" were. What I thought was going to be another entertaining but by the same formula movie took some unexpected turns that threw me off balance and peaked my interest. Gregg Sulkin was great as usual but Garrett Clayton's performance was very interesting. He plays his role with such Frat boy sleaze that... well. I had just seen Clayton in ""King Cobra"" and the two characters could not have been more different. From gay porn star to misogynistic college pretty boy used to duping women into bed.  Both boys are former Disney stars and it is apparent that their talents were not used to the full advantage. Their fear as their game gets turned and things progressed was palpable. I was truly scared for them.
I am not going to spoil the plot here but I will say that this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. Just when you THINK you know what is going on,  you do not. Very much worth your time in my opinion.",1520467200,,1217,4.4774774774774775

540590,4,6303051618,"Was pretty interesting. I figured it would end with it being twisted around. I know its just a movie, but I find it odd that the kid who actually did the prank call, wasn't the one who was the main target.",1520121600,,205,4.024390243902439

While some of it was annoying, cliche, and juvenile, I love the plot.  You just don't know what damage your actions can cause and you cannot underestimate someones resolve.  My best friend and I always say, ""Leave people, and their things ALONE.""  You mess with the wrong person, and get GOT!  He pranked them alright - and it cost them everything!  WOW.

540655,4,6303051618,"Saturday Movie Review:
This is a thriller with lots of twists and turns. It kept me guessing until the end. It rates a 9 of 10 for not being able to figure it out until the very end. It starts out with a great intro. The beginning 20 minutes almost make it like you want to shut it off becuase it seems like just a teen/early 20's something film that you would watch with your friends. I kept watching and happy I did. Out of the 100's of thrillers I have personnaly seen I give this a 6 almost 7 out of 10. It is on par with the Scream series but with a much better plot and ending! There won't be any sequels to this one though....leave it as a stand alone movie and it goes down as one to watch for a long time!

540761,4,6303051618,"Don't Hang Up is a very formulaic movie, there's nothing new here, in fact the ending is kind of annoying because we've seen that done so many times now, it isn't clever or a surprise.  It's true the two main characters (victims) aren't that likable, and you certainly are on the side of their tormentor, however their tormentor does also involve some innocent people, so you do kind of hope they stop him. No the two guys doing prank calls that go way beyond ""is your refrigerator running, why don't you go out and catch it then?"" You certainly don't like them, in fact you wonder why they haven't been visited by the police due to their stupidity of uploading their calls along with their own faces and identities chasing fame.

But overall it's a decent and entertaining enough watch.  There's aspects such as a knife being completely clean that should have some blood on it, and things like this, you do wonder doesn't anyone else live in this street that would have called the cops, but it's a movie.",1517616000,,1005,4.572222222222222

The intensity of this film and the suspense was pretty good although there for a while I had to ask myself how is ""Mr Lee"" controlling everything in the house... power, 911 calls, etc still it kept the drama going.
In the end it was not too hard to find the killer though as you knew it had to be a previous victim.  All in all decent enough.

541146,3,6303051618,"I wanted to like this movie a lot and went into it just expecting some fun chills and thrills.  Sadly the whole thing is a missed opportunity.  The acting here is really pretty good.  I am a big Garrett Clayton fan which had me more excited to see this.  Sadly it is easy to think the acting is poor due to the poorly written and constructed script.  The two main characters from the first second of the film are so unlikable that it seems the acting is just bad.  But it is the script.  The two leads try so hard to breath life into this film.  Many thrillers are totally implausible as is the plot twists here but sadly the characters are so unlikable you don't care what happens to them.  This film seems to be made with a good budget and I will reiterate they got some good actors involved.  But when a script is poorly executed nothing else matters.  There is no build up to the main plot, no real back stories to the characters and by the time our main characters show their sympathetic sides it is too late.  This could have been a whole different experience if there had been a plausible lead in story and some true history of the leads so that they mattered and more importantly were likable.  Imagine, watching a thriller where you can't root for the leads.  That is how unlikable the script portrays them.  Garrett Clayton and Gregg Sulkin deserved much better.  Since I am a Clayton fan I am happy I purchased this film but for others I must say this film plot had such potential and could have even had a slight message to it but it instead plays out so poorly due to the script.",1491523200,,1592,4.291946308724833
541187,5,6303051618,"4 1/2 stars. This movie far exceeded what the cover gives off. it is not a ""cheap"" film meaning there is lots of original thought put into it. Like many movies we watch, just imagine if the right amount of money was put into it (advertising). It'd be a blockbuster everyone would've remembered.",1491264000,,294,4.566037735849057
541188,3,6303051618,"Slick but highly implausible thriller about two teens who get their kicks making cruel prank phone calls and posting the results on the internet.  That is until one night when a mysterious stranger decides to turn the tables on them and subjects them to a night of terror.  I say the film is highly implausible because the person who is doing the terrorizing might as well be God.  He apparently sees and hears everything that the teens do, can turn off and on every single light in the house at will, can intercept their landline and cell phone calls and control their computers.  He can also pick people off the street and kidnap or murder them without being seen and put dead bodies wherever he wants without anybody noticing.

The other problem with Don't Hang Up is that the two male protagonists who are being terrorized are so thoroughly unlikable it robs the film of any reason to care about what happens to them.  I honestly wanted to murder the pair myself.  The movie tries to compensate by throwing some innocent victims into the mix but since they never function as anything other than props it doesn't work.  Worse yet, the one character whom we could possibly care about the fate of turns out to be as unlikable as the boys.

So what are you left with?  Don't Hang Up is slickly made and fast paced but it never rises above the level of being a well made time waster.  It's impossible to care about what happens or believe much of it so all you can really do is go along for the ride and forget about it all as soon as the movie is over.",1491091200,,1552,4.391608391608392

541194,3,6303051618,"Don't Hang Up is the feature film debut of two guys I couldn't be bothered looking up the names of, because like you, I don't care. This film is a throwback to 1990's horror movies. The plot revolves around a couple of teenage best friends who have recently graduated high school and have pretty much a youtube account that they upload a bunch of pranks on, mostly prank calls. However they have really ticked off the wrong person now, and all the fun and games soon come to an end when someone they pranked turns the game around and comes after them with the two boys having no idea who it is.

Overall the acting is decent, nothing Oscar worthy, but it's not going for that, it has a pretty decent plot and the outcome is very predictable, but still enjoyable. I enjoyed the film for what it was, and if you're asking is it anything like Friend Request or something like that? No, it isn't a through the camera-lens thing.

Having said that, it's not a blood and gore fest, or have visual effects like Final Destination. It's just a simple horror/thriller with a couple of nice twists, and it's a pretty good flick. Saying that tho, I doubht I would watch it again, at least not anytime soon, so it loses a star for that, but 3 stars is still pretty good.

I'm not really sure what movie to compare it to, some have said Scream, but it's not really that... nor is it anything like Taken as someone suggested. I dunno, just check out for yourself if it interests you.",1489881600,,1468,4.3699633699633695

One night while home alone, they make their prank calls, but then one of the people they call knows them and things get serious as this turns into a semi-home invasion type of film with a stranger calling the shots...or else.

The serious prank phone calls famously died down in 2012 when an individual took their own life over one. If you watch these types of films you have a pretty good idea of the ""why"" behind it. After all there can only be one reason Scooby-Doo. The film had some decent scenes, but was over-all uneven. This is certainly not the worst in the genre, at least they didn't use a voice distorter. Considering the many bad horror films that have come out lately, you could do worse.

Both are extremely believable as they struggle to love in spite  of all the odds, both geographical/physical and emotional against which  they are pitted. The reality of social isolation is excellently presented  as Suchet the overweight former British ,playwright now a house-bound  recluse finds himself increasingly involved with Arquette, a disabled New  York stage actress, with the telephone as their only means of  communication. It shows that a drama based around such a long-distance  relationship is far from uninteresting as we are drawn into their  relationship, with all the pitfalls and ups and downs of a  ""normal"" liaison between a man and woman drawn to one another.  The triumph of the piece is in its message as well as its unique plot: the  message that it is possible for two such people, whom some would cruelly  dismiss as ""losers"" in life, can together draw one another out of  their separate yet not dissimilar predicaments and help one another to  regain dignity and find love.",955152000,,1222,5.075376884422111

pretty much everything I despise in a human.  I didn't know how long I could endure their
sickening behavior, and only hung in there because I knew a pay-back was coming.  Glad I did,
as the pay-back was very satisfying.  I'd like to send Mr. Lee a list of movie characters to subject
to similar treatment.

The production values were high, the acting good.  This is not some cheapo flick put together
by sub-talented filmmakers with only vain aspirations to support them.  This is a film made
by experienced professionals.  It kept me in suspense the whole time, and cleverly wrapped up
the revenge scenario very nicely with a series of occurrences I didn't see coming.

I notice several people had a problem with how Mr. Lee could possibly orchestrate all this.
For some reason this didn't bother me at all (and such things usually do).  He just did, and
I was able to take it at face value.  I can always suspend belief in one area of a movie if the
rest is as engrossing as this one was.  (I personally thought their neighbors noticing none of
the mayhem was more dubious, lol)

Gore factor is there, but no killings too off-the-wall.  Just standard knife-play, shootings, etc.,
with a fair amount of blood; but all were effectively done without the feel of over-reveling in it.
Language contains a few f-bombs, but WAY less than most of these type films.  No nudity,
and one sex scene so minimal it hardly counts, and really was relevant to the story for a change.
