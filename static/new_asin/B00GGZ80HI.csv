8623025,2,B00GGZ80HI,"This is garbage. Dont waste yer money on this pirate crap. True, it's footage of FZ on SNL but only in a small screen surrounded on all 4 sides by a monstrously thick border with the title on either side. Absurd. One is just as well viewing said footage on a mobile screen via youtube. The only reason I give it 2 stars is that betwixt each song is an audio only interview w/FZ discussing his musical gear, which would only inteterest other musicians. This disc is rubbish. Disgraceful. Shame on Amazon for ped'lin such inferior bunk as this.",1422662400,22,542,4.484848484848484
