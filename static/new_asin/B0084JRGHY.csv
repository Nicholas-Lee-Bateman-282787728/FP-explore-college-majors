8525173,2,B0084JRGHY,I would love this album however it's in video format. Please make this a music album.,1490832000,,85,4.375
8525174,5,B0084JRGHY,"I really have no other way to describe this except whereas ""traditional"" atmospheres of yoga are like a sweet in-the-moment milk chocolate, this black yoga is more like a more earthy, more satisfying dark chocolate.  Or would that be the difference between a boxed cake mix and one from scratch?  Or the difference between a sweet candy and a piece of fruit?  Maybe the difference between a handshake and a hug?  I have no idea how to describe this other than uncommonly delicious.  Not everyone can find peace with the general aesthetic that they're aiming for with this, but I'd encourage even folks who resonate more with the ""traditional"" atmosphere to at least rent it and try it out.",1490745600,,689,4.756302521008403

8525176,1,B0084JRGHY,"I love the concept and I really enjoyed the beginning of the video. However, after about 5 minutes the audio gets choppy and then at 21 minutes it freezes on a single shot and stays that way until about 45 minutes in. I want a refund",1460505600,,233,4.086956521739131
8525177,4,B0084JRGHY,"Good practice and better than usual music, exactly what I hoped for. I only wish they had gone even heavier.",1458259200,,108,4.45
8525178,5,B0084JRGHY,"This is rad! I've tried yoga quite a few times in the past but this is so much better. I'm relaxed as can be, I didn't tune out or let my head go elsewhere because it was music I was into. The description they give nails it and that other dude is right, just buy it, you're going to want to after renting it.",1456358400,2,308,3.828125
8525179,5,B0084JRGHY,Just buy it. I don't know what I'd do without it.,1456358400,,49,3.5454545454545454
