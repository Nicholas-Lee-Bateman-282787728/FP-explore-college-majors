2248952,5,B0007XLFC2,"Since when has Randall Grass, manager of NJ indie label Shanachie Records, become an expert on bellydance? The self appointed ""Duke of Soul"" from Marlton NJ  who wrote ""What a waste"" review below may know his way around reggae, Irish and soul music, but shame on him for reviewing his competitors' music and video productions and blurting out opinions about, of all things, bellydancing. Click on the wish list in his profile, and you'll see Randall Grass' name. Ironically I own a stack of Shanachie records CDs....

Oh, BTW Randall also reviewed a couple CDs by....Shanachie Records!...

giving his reviews modest titles like ""quality from beginning to end"".... Bad boy!

""The Golden Apple"" --  I love it!

Every dancer displays great individuality. I've seen these ladies perform and the dances on this DVD are just as artful and soulful as they are in live performance. Kudos to them for putting out this production. You elevate our dance form to beyond mere entertainment, to the level of high art!",1151107200,8,1003,4.940476190476191
2248953,5,B0007XLFC2,"In the ""About This DVD"" section, Neon explains that her goal was to create a performance DVD that expresses what we feel everyday in our lives while leaving behind the parameters of bellydance origin, technique and history. She accomplishes just that and does a superb job.  It may be a good idea to include this statement on the cover if it's ever re-designed.

The performances are mostly done to non-traditional music by Jehan. The music is mystical and sensuous and really hooked me.  I was disappointed to find that all of Jehan's CD's are completely sold out when I visited her site. Neon, Blanca and Jenna express the messages of the songs, truly interpreting them through their dance. These dancers also demonstrate the sense of empowerment that the dance has given to so many of us. My instructor would describe them as ""real"" as they are not ""performing."" They dance with a clear sense of freedom, emotion and joy rather than stiff, rehearsed routines. Each dancer is obviously enjoying herself and this is so important in this dance - they're definitely letting their inner goddess out to play, and She's having a blast. The performances are very sensuous without being overtly sexual or inappropriate and the sets and costumes are absolutely magical. There are candles, veils and an amazing sword duet.

The most outstanding part of this DVD, I think, is Jehan's performance. This is the first and only performance DVD that I've seen that features a goddess-sized dancer in all her beauty and magnificence. They deserve kudos for that.

If you're not stuck in the mindset that traditional middle eastern dance should not be deviated from, have a true appreciation of art and recognize bellydance as an art form, you'll appreciate this DVD. The dancers truly demonstrate the creative and expressive spirit of the dance and are true artists. If you practice this style of dance as we do in our troupe, you'll be inspired by these excellent performances. Whether you are a dancer or just a fan of the dance, opening your mind and heart to this break from tradition will show you the incredible art that is possible in bellydance.",1147910400,16,2138,4.878787878787879
2248954,2,B0007XLFC2,"That pretty much explains it all.  I think I've seen women work their hips better in local clubs then in the video.  There were a few nice hand movements and hip simulations...about 3...mostly from Blanca, but overall it was dissapointing.  I wanted to feel the heat, but nothing got beyond luke warm.  I wouldn't buy the video...unless maybe you are looking for patterns for a belly-dancing costume or something.",1132012800,13,413,4.942028985507246
2248955,3,B0007XLFC2,"The three dancers featured on this DVD are ok, but I can't stand this ""stars- superstars"" thing, where they take a few dancers and push them down your throat as hard as they can through every media channel they can sneak in,  and idolize them like they are the only ones worth seeing.

""Bellydance stars of New York""? Why only these three? Because somebody filthy rich decided they have a look that sells and has unlimited resources to throw at promoting them. I know great dancers in New York (and I've taken workshops with some of them) who are far better than any ""superstars"", but they don't bother to accomodate the mass market demand for sexy glitz  and refuse to sell themselves to greedy promoters.

And the way they take the word ""bellydance"" and pretend it's trendy. Hello!? There is no such thing as ""bellydance."" ""Bellydance"" is a layman's term for  Middle Eastern dance, Arabic, Turkish, and other authentic dance forms. Last time I saw Neon dance live she wore jeans and had gold tattoos painted all over her body and what she did was some kind of fusion gothic-underground I don't know what, one of these new trends, but it wasn't Middle Eastern dance. It' wasn't Middle Eastern music.

If ""stars of bellydance"" don't care about the authenticity of their dancing how can they pretend to represent bellydance? They think they can just come up with glitzy stuff and the young MTV crowd will swallow it.",1117670400,29,1415,4.708502024291498
2248956,5,B0007XLFC2,"The dancers on this DVD are top notch examples of the many styles within the art of belly dancing, from the more traditional, graceful performances of Jenna, to the modern sophistication of the dazzling Neon, this is a collection that will delight all fans of this genre.

It's a DVD that I appreciate more with each viewing, and it is also wonderful to listen to. The songs are an exotic mix by Jehan, who writes a world music fusion with lyrics that are full of erotic mysticism, and celebrate the goddess in every woman, and by the Taksim Trio (Souren Baronian, Haig Manpukian, Mal Stein), a group that does marvelous interpretations of near-eastern melodies.

The costumes sparkle with color and are beautifully designed, and they flatter and flow with the dancer's movements, and though the performances are not brightly lit, the details of the garments are lovely.

Jenna, whose choice of music tends to be more traditional, does three numbers, one of them a drum solo that is very effective, and it is followed by sword dance duet with Blanca that is incredible. I cannot imagine how such a feat is done, but it is a marvel to watch. Jenna has consummate grace, with arms that move with such a natural flow they are like a flower unfolding.

Blanca is exquisite. There is a youthful charm about her personality, and a nubile sensuality that is seductive with a touch of innocence. Her two solo numbers are passionate and expressive, and she is part of the sword dance duo mentioned above.

Neon is superb. Her sculpted figure is astonishing, and her electric movements are so expertly done that she makes it all look easy. Neon does 3 numbers, and the final one, in a fantastic red costume, is riveting, and brings the art of belly dancing to a new high.

Jehan gives one performance, and it's a gem. Full figured and gorgeous, she is a 21st century goddess, with charisma and total assurance of her womanly charms. Jehan is of course, the composer of many of the songs on this DVD, making her a multi talented artist.

The final performance is by the Taksim Trio, playing their terrific ""Jammed Tight"".

Total running time for this fabulous DVD, enjoyable on many levels, is 55 minutes.

As a former dancer, I'm enthralled by the technique, the excellence, and the sheer beauty of these performers, and it's a DVD that will entertain and fascinate for years to come.",1117411200,25,2374,4.714975845410628
2248957,5,B0007XLFC2,"Last year, unable to come up with a good gift, I gave a belly dance DVD.  The response I got was so positive that I gave another one - and now they're about all I give to anyone.  I'm giving instruction or exercise DVDs to dancers, and performance videos for my non-dancer family and friends  my way to promote belly dance, heh-heh!  ""The Golden Apple"" is a performance DVD that is my top choice, and here is why.  It blends modern and traditional belly dance and music.  The dancing is stunning and the design even the box is beautiful to hold. The Golden Apple flows like a movie.  There's tons of eye candy for people who don't care about choreography and transitions. And the song lyrics are in English...with subtitles just in case you can't hear the words!  (There is only one song in Arabic).  I love Egyptian pop but my family can't relate to that, so this really works for them.  The production is top notch and real art, and that's how I want my circle to see my beloved belly dance world, as a respected sophisticated artform. Jenna, Neon and Blanca are amazing, I love all performances on thie DVD! The whole experience is very glamourous and unlike so many belly dance shows the dance numbers on this DVD have the sophistication of real theater.  Neon and Blanca are 'modern' while Jenna is more 'classical' and Middle Eastern in her dance.  Strongly recommended.",1113436800,25,1376,4.571428571428571
2248958,5,B0007XLFC2,"The Golden Apple DVD packs a lot of dance, music and video artistry into its 55 minutes. It's the best-produced belly dance performance video I've seen.  The colors and effects are amazing. The camera respects the dancers, it serves and admires them, none of that choppy editing typical of most other bellydance performance videos.  Lots of closeups, but all very discreet, no random focusing on body parts. Angles switch often, but the movement is depicted consistently. Every move is finished and you can see all choreographies in full.

You will hear traditional bellydance music by the ""Taksim"" ensemble  (New York) and modern ""arabesque fusion"" music by Jehan, a New York singer-songwriter-dancer. It's great to be able to understand the song lyrics and see how the dancers relate to them. You can also turn on optional subtitles and read the lyrics!  That's the coolest feature I 've ever seen on any dance DVD. The set is a black stage decorated with a cascade of live candles and also a lush restaurant with Arab decor.

Dancers: JENNA who has just moved from NY to LA is one of the best dancers I've ever seen, her style is very refined and graceful.  The way she interprets the music honors the music. She performs a dance to an Arabic song wearing an embroidered velvet gown, and it's a gorgeous choreography. ""Lama Bada"" song with the band, also great, and an amazing drum solo, so cute, sharp and engaging I had to watch it 3 times before I could move on!!!  Her interaction with the drummer was warm and entertaining.

BLANCA comes from Mexico, but her dancing is totally New York.  Her first costume is heavily beaded (it's the one on the cover). She articulates bellydance movements like nobody else I've ever seen, she looks relaxed and glowing like she's dancing on the beach, but her movements are strongly defined and passionate. She descends from a throne or a pedestal high above the stage holding two candles, dances with the candles, then you see her dance with a veil. The veil song is ""Oceans of Ecstasy"" by Jehan and the refrain says ""touch me with your eyes"", cute!  Blanca's dance style is infused with subtle drama and is very modern. Her second number is all floorwork!!  Superb!  The ""Poem of the Sword"" duet by JENNA and BLANCA is very athletic and mysterious.

The third New York dancer is NEON, who is originally from Moscow!!  Her first number was believe it  or not, a rap song (remember, this is New York bellydance!) with the flavor of world music. It's about a man's spiritual journey and self discovery.  Totally original and really great.  Her costume is all pearls and green leaves of sheer fabric. Neon has her own dance style, elegant, modern and theatrical. She is extremely flexible. Sometimes her body seems to melt.

The DVD also features one performance by Jehan, a full-figured dancer of awesome skill and charisma. She dances with a fearless abandon, and after hearing her songs I felt I really identified with her in her dance. Music seems to radiate from Jehan, it is internal to her.

I happened to buy this DVD together with an old bellydance video, ""Arabian melodies"", from the '80s. Compare them, and you will see that the gap between the two is not just 20 years, but two centuries! The dancers are all great, but the evolution of dance style, costuming, music and attitude is unbelievable.",1112054400,11,3349,4.751295336787565
2248959,4,B0007XLFC2,"I was happy to receive my review copy of The Golden Apple: Bellydance Stars of New York the other day.  I finally got to watch it last night.  This is strictly a performance DVD.  You won't find any instruction or voice-overs.

The DVD includes almost an hour of performances by NYC performers Neon, Jehan, Jenna, and Blanca, as well as a jam session with the skilled and talented Taksim ensemble.  The production values are strong, and although the camera rarely holds still, cuts and pans are not obtrusive.  Face shots are kept to a minimum.  The focus is generally on the dancer, or the part of her body doing a particular movement.  The sound quality is excellent, whether the music is live (ie. with Taksim's jam session) or canned.  If you were so inclined, you could turn the video off and listen to this as though it were a CD.

In general, the dancers have large, expansive movements.  Each dancer has her own musical taste.  The music ranges from traditional Egyptian to Arabesque hiphop to new age breathy vocals.  Although I doubt the style of every performance, costume, and song will appeal to any one person, I do believe the DVD is well worth the cost.

The DVD can be used as a costume show of sorts, with each dancer wearing a different outfit every time they dance.  Mostly the dancers are in bedlah (the bra and skirt ""uniform"" of the belly dancer), although the first dance is performed in a one-piece brown velvet dress.

Among my favourite performances are Blanca's floorwork improvisation. I really didn't like her skirt (I couldn't help but think she's wearing diapers under it!), but I'm a sucker for good floorwork, and she has an excess of style, grace, and strength.  I enjoy her presentation of Turkish folds (going back and forth from kneeling backbends).

I also enjoy Jenna's drum solo improvisation.  What I like in particular is how the DVD shows the way a dancer interacts with a live band.  It's very playful, and fun to watch.  Her movements are tight, and an excellent interpretation of the music.  And she does it all in really high-heeled shoes.

The other performance of note is Jehan's 21st Century Priestess choreography.  Although I'm not completely comfortable with the in-your-face sexuality of her performance (shimmying kneeling backbends with crotch to the audience, and rolling around like a total sex kitten), there's no denying this woman's ease of movement and powerful stage presence.  I also fear for her neck with the violence of her head flinging (whiplash, anyone?).  Nevertheless, I find her dancing inspirational, partially because she's a very strong dancer, but also because she proves undeniably that a plus-sized woman can do all the same stuff a skinny woman can do, and maybe even with extra oomph.",1111017600,20,2766,4.844349680170576
8053563,5,B0007XLFC2,Gave as a gift and it was well received.,1505433600,,40,3.5555555555555554
8053564,4,B0007XLFC2,"This DVD features skilled belly dancers who are quite talented. There was one performance with Jehan done with veils. Jenna's performances were largely the most genuine and enjoyable. The best setting was in the restaurant-style area with live Taksim music. It was far better than the dark stage and recorded music. Some of the recorded music needed to either have better lyrics or none at all. Sometimes it's just better to go with the real deal than to try to make something different out of belly dance.

I do think this collection of performances is worth adding to your collection, but it's a shame the videographer kept filming the dancers at tilted angles and introducing strange effects, as if the dancers' performance couldn't possibly be interesting enough, so he had to spice it up. This is not a James Bond movie! We want to see the authentic performance of the dancers. At one point, Neon (who was wearing an orange outfit) was suddenly desaturated in color so she looked like she was a strange blue hue. Is this necessary? No. It detracts from the feel of the performance.

Also, there was a bit too much floor work for my taste. At one point Blanca was rolling around on the dirty floor like a little rumpled girl. But Jenna did a great job of doing level changes without going overboard. I'd like to see more of her work.

I hope the next time a collection of performances is released featuring these dancers that the music is right and the videographer refrains from strange and unflattering effects. It's really about the belly dancer's talent, not about the videographer's odd way of filming things.",1334188800,,1618,4.750889679715303
8053565,3,B0007XLFC2,"found this video selling sex and not the art of belly dance.  Belly dance should be sensual, but I did not feel this was in the true spirit of belly dance.  The words to several of the songs more suited for a strip club. examples: ""With every breath I wait for you naked and pure"". ""I want you, I want you, I want you, over and over and over again"". ""Feel sexy as your sweat drips"".
Another song was rap, and one costume was see through.  I think they were trying to put a different spin on belly dance, like some have done with bollywood, or flamingo, but this just did not work.
I gave this three stars because, these girls can dance. This was just not my style, and belly dance has a bad name.  I think belly dancers should strive to change that.
I did like the sword duo. Jehan was also good. My recomendation..rent it, don't buy it.",1261353600,,837,4.180124223602484
8053566,2,B0007XLFC2,"The reviewer that got bashed for saying this is a mediocre dvd is correct. To a passionate dancer or afficinado, the routines more often than not are awkard and flat and really out of step.

Almost no one in this complilation of dancers can seem to find the beat or dance with any timely connection to the music. I very much liked the production value and the different settings - it had the potential to be great, but the fact is none of these women, at least on this night, were great, spellbinding, or breathtaking - which is what I expect. Where`s the passion for dance? Where the aura of the artist? All I see when I watch this are people who technically know strings of moves but could just as well be sleepwalking. When I watch a dancer if my mind keeps wondering *when is this thing over?* - you know you lost me. They just do not amaze or enchant. Very amaturish and ultimately dull and repetitive despite the lavishness. Watching them fumble was akin to the slow, painful process of trying to communicate with someone who speaks only a language foreign to you. Frustrating!

If you can borrow it from a library or a friend, maybe. But not money well spent. Will most likely collect dust. Nothing to aspire too, it pains me to say because the struggle to delight and the effort is there, but it just never gets off the ground.",1223424000,,1335,4.4227642276422765
8053567,5,B0007XLFC2,"Okay, girls!  Get ready for some costume envy!  They are fabulous!
This is a fun and fashionable DVD that showcases several styles of dancing that you are sure to enjoy.  The beads, sequins and chiffon are sure to make you drool.  The performances are great and I love how some interaction with live musicians was shown.  Someone in my household noted that the background was sometimes distracting, but I was watching the dance too carefully to notice that, so that will be a matter of taste!
Enjoy!",1215129600,,499,4.689655172413793

8053570,4,B0007XLFC2,"I found this video to be well presented and professional.

The content is exciting and well performed. The dancers show their talent very well and if I have one negative comment it is that I think the dances are more inclined towards the Western concept of the dance rather than the authentic Eastern.

Nevertheless, all the performers show excellent talent.

I would reccommend this video to anyone interested in Belly Dancing.",1173830400,4,428,5.0
8053571,3,B0007XLFC2,"Fair production value, although the dances/dancers are very poorly lit at times. Bellydance fans will probably appreciate this DVD. Bellydancers may find it repetitive.
