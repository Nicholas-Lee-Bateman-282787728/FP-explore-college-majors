I use more open terms, as it sends a really good and quite truthful, message for however your household is set up. If both parents work, then put both yourselves in the ""mans shoes"" and see how it is probably effecting and possibly hurting, your children. The title is kind of deceiving, as I wouldn't call them losers, just lost site of their priorities over time and quit ""listening"" to their spouses, and being their for their families, not intentionally.  I feel that it is a must see, as we can lose track and veer off course so easy and not even realize how it effects others.  It is a lighthearted comedy, but I feel it carries a great message.",1465948800,,857,4.480769230769231

Sometimes it just seemed as if it was just said just for the sake of saying it, but it served no real purpose. It was a highly annoying. There were moments when I had to pause it, take a breath and play it again. Lol. I really tried to like it, but the profanity made it ok. I did enjoy the chemistry been Tika Sumpter and John Stamos.
