2765092,4,B000NDFI7O,"The film The Young Aphrodites is loosely based on Daphnis and Chloe , one of the best known early Greek romances, precursors to the modern novel. It has been reinterpreted in music and art by Ravel and Chagall and in cinema by Nikos Koundouros in 1963.

Written by Longus in the second century A.D, Daphnis and Chloe is a classical romance involving the adventures of two foundling children raised by adopted parents who are humble shepherds in the idyllic setting of the Isle of Lesbos. It is a famous love story that captures the awakening of a first love between two teenagers who don't know what is happening to them. The novel that was written almost two thousand years ago is surprisingly modern; it is erotic, tender, romantic, sensual, and simply beautiful.

The ancient but forever young tale of the sexual awakening as adapted and retold by Nikos Koundouros in Young Aphrodites, takes place on a poetic island that might have came from ancient times. The film it full of symbolism, innocence, and darkness of desire and longing. Young Aphrodites, may and will disturb some or perhaps many viewers who are uncomfortable with the subject of youth sexuality, especially by the very young age of two actors, and by (even if artfully done) nudity of a young actress playing Chloe, Comparing to the novel of Dafnis and Chloe, the film is much darker and its ending can be viewed as dramatic even heartbreaking loss of innocence and first overwhelming love. The film creator, the Greek Director Nikos Koundouros refers to it as a film of desperation - ""Desperation which is described in beautiful blue waters of Aegean Sea, with two young kids exploring their bodies. Desperation because we had discredited, abolished, and immobilized ourselves, we who had fought, who had raised our voices, who had demonstrated for a new world. There was nothing for us to do. In my desperation, I decided to work on nothingness. This is a film about ideological nothingness."" The reason for making this movie might have been nothingness and desperation but the result nevertheless is sensual, young, and at the same time joyous and sad.

Very sadly, the film is almost unknown to the modern audiences. There is no discussions, thoughts, and very few comments on it on on the major film forums. I found it an amazing, beautiful, and one of the most erotic movies ever made. It is a delightful gem which has stayed with me since I had pleasure to watch it.

2765093,5,B000NDFI7O,"The appeal of this film is 12-year-old Kleopatra Rota's inability to keep her body covered with the wisp of a garment provided by the costume department.  However the film as a whole has a haunting beauty and the feeling of a bleak fairy tale.  it begs  to be read allegorically.  You have men in the wilderness with their animals, women behind the wall of a village.  A mature woman longs for the freedom, sexual and otherwise, the shepherds enjoy and struggles with her desire personified by a mature shepherd.  A young girl struggles with her emerging sexuality in an innocent game with a boy just feeling his hormones, and is raped and surrenders to a somewhat older boy so besotted with hormones he can't speak.  Taken together, the five characters represents, stages, motivations, and possibilities of the never ending dance between men and women. But this is all done visually, with a subtle story arc, so that you feel the motivations without having them articulated.  The characters are fantastic, the music great, everything a bit exotic.  Way better than all the david hamilton films put together.",1229817600,32,1108,4.913978494623656
2765094,5,B000NDFI7O,"Overall, a very well made movie. But the most fascinating aspect of this film--- which I believe indeviduals who give this film a bad review forget--- is that the film is based on an ancient Greek myth, and interpreted by modern Greeks. That is why I have given this film 5 stars; because from the music to the actors, the whole production is authentically Greek. And after all, that is the point of viewing foreign films! The erotic aspect... well, any boy who has gone through puberty should be able to understand the almost hapless.. I mean helpless state of the boy in the film.

2765096,4,B000NDFI7O,"This film is a mixture of realism and myth.  There are hints of Daphnis and Chloe, but this is not their story at all.

A naive and good young boy (played by a blonde boy of about eleven) travels with a group of sheepherders.  At one of their stops, he wanders off and finds a mysterious young girl of about 13 or 14.  He falls in love with her, but she plays hard to get and sets tasks for him to do in order to win her.  At one point, she teases him wearing a loose garment off one shoulder.  There are several shots in which her young breasts are visible, but the twilight is dim.  At the end (spoiler coming), an older boy of his group sees the girl, throws her to the ground and rapes her.  She screams and resists at first, then throws herself into it.  The boy is totally disallusioned, and we see him walking off into the sea dragging the albatross that has been a bond between him and the girl throughout the movie.

That's really it.  You make of it what you will, but few people will be able to watch this movie and not have strong mixed feelings of one kind or another.",1182038400,83,1081,4.1

2765134,3,B000NDFI7O,"I found this movie somewhat unfathomable in terms of the milieu, mostly taking place near a body of
water that races over boulders with the two youngsters, among four characters, jump around on with
bare feet.  It seems to be a movie about somewhat conflicting courtship rituals as between a small
fishing society and a small nomadic herding society.  But these two social systems are never given
enough screen time to tell us much about them so as to provide some background for the total
concentration on the two pairs, male and female, in which one pursues the other.  I learned after
watching the movie that it is based on some very early Greek literature referring to events, real or
imagined, that are said to have occurred in 200 A.D. I believe the source indicates.  It's worth
watching precisely because you find yourself immersed in trying to grasp where these interactions
are leading -- the characters talk very little (although seem to share at least some elements of a
common language, perhaps early Greek analogous to early English?",1466985600,5,1047,4.865168539325842

It seems to me that the creator of this film confused ancient (and sophisticated) mythology with inarticulate primitivism. They tried to locate a 'primitive' and 'primal' society, and that's what they came up with. Unless ""based on"" could be construed as 'anything you want to say' this film is really not based on said mythology.

studied the Greek language and had college courses that included Greek ancient history, mythology, culture and literature.  One of the well-known myths is the saga about Daphne and Chloe, on an Island (Lesbos?). This film by Nilkos Koundouros seems to be a very excellent contemporary
rendition of Daphne and Chloe in an authentic primitive setting; it was filmed in the ancient ruins and countryside by the sea in Greece.  The viewer
must be focused on the nature of a foreign culture to understand the context  in which two young Greek adolescents experience the start of puberty.
The youngsters are in a primitive world surrounded by real Greek dancers, shepherds and peasants.  In that austere atmosphere of a savage nomadic life, the young Greeks struggle as virgins with the first emotional symptoms of puberty such as lust, physical sexual desire.  Some of the nudity may be perplexing, but in some cultures both girls and boys are public with bare chests until puberty begins.  Notice the young Girl becomes
preoccupied with covering her breasts for the first time, and notice the boy pulls away her top as though he does not want to see her virginity change in protest of a budding puberty that both of them are vexed with new emotional attractions that are mysterious to understand.  This is an excellent DVD for a foreign film which a genuine Greek Producer attempts to illustrate about the land and culture of his native land.",1425686400,10,1584,4.906367041198502

Filmed in black and white in a seemingly remote Greek landscape, this pastoral romance is loosely based on Longus's ""Daphnis and Chloe"", written in the second century AD. It is an ancient tale but has been turned by director Nikos Koundouros into a timeless classic.

The subtle and sensitive cinematography is greatly enhanced by a superb musical score and the outstanding performances of Eleni Prokopiou (Chloe) and Vangelis Ioannides (Skymnos) as the two youngsters struggling to understand their awakening sexuality.

The heartbreaking ending, when Skymnos is left behind by Chloe and the departing shepherds, ironically evokes the legend of Aphrodite who, it is said, was born from the sea.

Ever since the first viewing it has been in my personal top five. It's a story told in images, full of wonderful symbolism, beautifully photographed in black and white. It plays in a long ago Greece, in a village by the sea. The men are out fishing, the women are waiting for their return, and from the mountains a group of shepherds come down with their flocks. Thus the land meets the see, earth and water, male and female, birds and stones, a stork and a fish, birds captured in fishing nets etc. etc. This archetypical encounter is played out by the young (who remembers the intriguing poster of the prepubescent girl with the fishing net draped over her shoulder?) and the mature.

8177042,4,B000NDFI7O,"This is a 3-star film which gets the fourth star for being unusual. (It would be 3.5, but I don't have that option.) I first saw this described in a 1970s film rental catalog, and it's intrigued me ever since. It's not the usual fare of theater or cable TV, and I wasn't going to pay the (then) $75+ rental for a film copy, so I was very pleased to find it available via Amazon.
It's slower-moving than I expected; I thought there would be more interaction between the wandering shepherds and the fishermen, but once I got into the rhythm it moved nicely. Regardless of the still photo often used in catalog listings, there was very little real (depicted) sex, but be aware that there's a substantial amount of early-teen female nudity (topless only), but almost all of it is unrelated to sex - just natural lifestyle. I didn't know until a text segment at the end of the film told me, but this is set in the Greece of 200 BC. Language is not a problem, since there's little dialogue and the important portions are nicely subtitled.
Overall, I'd say viewing it was a pleasant experience, with glimpses of two long-gone lifestyles and a bittersweet coming of age saga. I have a feeling that either some footage has been lost or there was some sloppy editing; 3 or 4 times there seemed to be gaps in continuity, but not so severe as to cause confusion. I plan on watching it again in a month or so, knowing the setting from the beginning.
