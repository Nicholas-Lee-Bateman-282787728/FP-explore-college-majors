8420421,2,B004AKNRRY,"David Callan, an agent of a secret governmental dealing agency with internal security threats to the United Kingdom. He is employed as an assassin who stays in the job, only because, it is the only thing he is good at. Callan is a sympathetic character by contrast to his heartless upper-class associates and cold-hearted superior.

Unfortunately Callan - Wet Job is pretty weak material. It contains some awkwardly and ungainly dialogue. The direction is lumbering and the music warrants special reference as one of the worst soundtracks ever, compared to other Callan productions. The narrative deals with Callan being called back from retirement to carry out an assignment. It soon dawns on him that he will always be at the beck and call of his former employers as the story plays out.

I must say that I had seen some poor reviews for this offering; however, I chose to ignore them. Do I regret my decision, well yes and no? I just wanted to view it for completeness sake, I guess. As much as I want to recommend this production  I just cannot.",1470960000,,1049,4.721311475409836

8420423,1,B004AKNRRY,Edward Woodward -- a GREAT actor and GREAT performance. It gets one star because in the product description it does not indicate that this is a REGION 2 DVD! Shame on both the distributor and Amazon. The customers have the right to know BEFORE purchasing.,1420588800,,255,4.688888888888889
8420424,4,B004AKNRRY,Probably would have been five stars nearer the time it was made but it's a little dated and over done in a few parts. A solid four stars and well worth watching.,1410825600,,161,4.0625
8420425,4,B004AKNRRY,"A decent end to the series (this seems to be set later than the movie) in a post ""retirement"" time period.  It does not have that gritty feel of season 3/4 (the colour ones) but quite a decent story.  Hunter is a let down IMO but Calan and Lonely are great and the other supports are decent enough to carry the story.

As to the nonsense about region 2 - well it is what it is which is clear from the product info.  Make sure you have an ability to play region 2 before buying :-)",1400544000,,480,3.96875
8420426,4,B004AKNRRY,"Works fine in my computer, though.  I should have noticed the earlier review, though did not see region 2 just in the listings and probably didn't bother with the reviews.  Doesn't really bother me though.. an interesting 1981 ITV broadcast is fine on the small screen, believe me.",1399420800,3,281,4.833333333333333
8420427,1,B004AKNRRY,Actually I can't even give it a 1 star.  Just received recently and it was region 2.  That was not indicated on the screen when I ordered and not on the box.  Didn't know till I put in my player.  Very disappointed,1385510400,5,214,4.023809523809524
8420428,5,B004AKNRRY,"Edward Woodward brings to life Callan several years post retirement from the Section. However, as we all know, there is no such thing as ""retirement"".
Russell Hunter as Lonely makes another great appearance in this film which picks-up several years after Callan has ""left"" the service. This time his job is to eliminate a spy which he does with his usual aplomb & his questioning morality - however, ""orders is orders"" & the job is done.
A fitting conclusion to the ""Callan"" series.",1367625600,4,482,4.819277108433735
