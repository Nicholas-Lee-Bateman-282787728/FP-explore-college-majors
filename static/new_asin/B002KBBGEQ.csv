3939888,5,B002KBBGEQ,"Cook's Country is a parallel production to America's Test Kitchen made by the same people, in different setting (country setting this time) but sometimes covering the same equipment corner, taste tests and a bit more puzzling same recipes as appeared on America's Test Kitchen but with a different cooking method and ingredients without explaining why the differences such as one case in Cincinnati Chili. Nevertheless, Cook's Country is still a must have excellent academic, thorough and entertaining culinary resource for all home cooks and professional chefs who desire to be a step above the rest, and not wasting their time in the kitchen reinventing the wheel. Regardless of which season, Cook's Country takes the guessing out with detailed step by step instructions on how and why a certain ingredient, recipe and equipment is used along with a sleuth of informative factual and scientific tid bits explained in an easy-to-understand manner. Every season covers an array of primal and sub-primal meat cuts, fabrication, best cooking methods, equipment and product testing, ingredient taste tests, authentic to modern variation on many made-from-scratch global and regional soups, salads, appetizers, entrees, desserts, sauces, rubs, marinades and seasonings. Buy the whole collection and you will never be disappointed.",1272153600,7,1326,5.569306930693069

I started watching these 2 shows on PBS and have since bought both seasons of Cook's Country & The Complete America's Test Kitchen Cookbook.

The shows are fun to watch and contain a lot of great information for people who love to cook, even those who have been cooking many years like myself.",1264377600,5,382,4.602941176470588
