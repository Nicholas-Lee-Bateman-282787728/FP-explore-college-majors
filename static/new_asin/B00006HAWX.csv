1756357,5,B00006HAWX,"I was a little skeptical at first about the whole Yugioh idea. After sitting down and watching an episode on the KidsWB I found myself tuning in everyday for the next episode. Soon I was out buying the cards and even the old PS game. I'm a little older than the average Yugioh fan (probably) and I'm impressed. The only bad thing about this DVD that I noticed was the length. The [online store] site says its 90 minutes when in fact its only 60 minutes. That would be my only bad thing to report, and it isn't even a major issue. I highly recommend the Yugioh videos to everyone",1032825600,8,578,4.263636363636364
1756358,2,B00006HAWX,"I don't have the DVD but I've seen the dubbed and subtitled versions of the show and I don't think they are really that different.
They cut out very little other than the occasional ""damn"". Kaiba's suicide threat is sugar-coated and Tea's attacker is a mugger not a perverted gym teacher. The dubbed version dialog is a little more about fate than friendship.
I think the music and voices are better in the dubbed version. Pegasus' fey voice in the Japanese version is actually a little annoying.
As for the DVD, a scant total of 3 episodes is too few to pay for. Just tape it off Saturday morning TV or find the dubbed first season DVD set somewhere else.",1030579200,2,656,4.475

1756371,1,B00006HAWX,"This is without a single doubt,the WORST DUB EVER.I HATE 4Kids. Words cannot describe how badly they butchered this once good series. No doubt some idiot little kids will respond to this review with something along the lines of ""LOLKDI HEY GESS WAT ITZ STILL GUD WHO NEED BLUD ADN PEWVERTS LOlO WHO NEEDS ANOTHHRE AKIRA LOLO(which,I will add,is a classic...)"" There's NO character development any more,which,as anyone with half a brain can tell you,is very important. The dubbed voices are an insult to the original voice actors,who put their hearts into their voices! Jonouchi(Or ""Joey"") has a Brooklyn accent. Anzu(or ""TEA"" or whatever) now sounds stupid,and now acts stupid to match,unlike in the original,where she is very strong willed. Yugi's dub voice actor is a 40 year old!!Malik sounds like Skeletor,and now wants the millenium puzzle.(what?...)etc,etc. It now takes place in America,all the cards have had their pictures and names changed. The edits are all very lazy. All deaths are now replaced with 'being sent to the shadow realm' THAT MAKES ALOT OF SENSE.
Everything is changed. EVERYTHING.Plot,everything! Things are cut for NO REASON!This disk is edited,and there's no original japanese track!!!The 'fine people' at 4kids seem to forget that most anime is not some American cartoon like the Flinstones or whatever. They make me absolutely sick to my stomach,ruining great series that the creators worked hard to make,gaining anime an unfair reputation! it makes me sick!!!Also,all the music has been replaced,and now these idiotic little tunes always repeat,I'm sorry this review is so random,all my hatred for this ABOMINATION is flooding out at once.
There's tons more,but I'll spare you the discomfort of reading it,children.*rolls eyes*
I'd give this demon-spawn a -10000000 if I could. STAY AWAY UNTIL 4KIDS FIGURES OUT HOW TO USE THAT WRINKLY THING IN THEIR HEADS.
Pros-THE ORIGINAL WAS GOOD..OTHER THAN THAT NOTHING
Cons-TOO MANY TO NAME.
If anyone from 4Kids is reading this,counting their money from parents of stupid kids,please e-mail me at Sawquid@aol.com. Come on. I dare ya. Cowards...I want to set things right,but fate loves to mock me...",1075593600,4,2172,5.262247838616715
1756372,1,B00006HAWX,"Yugioh is a perfect example of how americanizing and censoring can truly screw up as series. They show is abound with needless edits, baaad dialog, and much, much more.
First, theres the voice acting. Yugi is supposed to sound like a timd, kind little kid. In the dub, he sounds like some stuck up 14 yr old loser. Dark yugi(yami yugi)'s voice sounds sooo deep and stupid, its hard to describe. Jonouchi (joey) now sounds like a dumb new yorker kid, which,belive me, does not fit his charectar. Seto kaiba sounds ok when he's acting tough and all, but as the other reviewer said, his attempts at being emotional sound way to fake. And the annoying voice acting goes perfect with the baad voice acting. Yami yugi ends up saying horrible lines like ""OH NOOO! A TRAAAP CARD?"", or ""HEART OF THE CARDS!"".
And joey's dailog is patethitic. He says stuff like ""GO drumsticks"", and ""MY DWAGON!"" (sounds exacly as its spelled).
Then, theres the edits, and to tell you the truth, the 100 word limit won't allow me to even describe HALF of the edits (and there are 500 so far OMG). First, to kiddyize the whole thing, they replaced anyone dying with being sent to ""the shadow relm"" or some other coverup. For example:When dark ryo bakura is confronted with gaurds (which i will get to later lol), he uses a card (morphing jar) to, not kill them like in the real version, but ""send them to the shadow relm"". Oh yeah, and kabia's parents didn't ""die"", they ""disappeared""...lol
And, for some reason beyond me, they paint out any form of guns. In the jap version, bandit keith threatens peaguses with a hangun.in the kids wb version, the gun is painted out so now he POINTS at him. Oooh.. scary. Another time, some idiot gaurds ""pointed"" at kaiba and told him to come see peaguses. And there is som much more they edited out. Editing ALL occult refrences, changing stragetys in duels, and paint over and changing the monsters/cards THEMSELVES! And did i mention that they cut out the ENTIRE first season (the ""manga"" version), and added new, HORRID music?
i tell ya folks, this is just pathetic. Dont wast your money on this so called ""Yu-Gi-Oh!""...",1069891200,5,2133,4.630606860158311
1756373,4,B00006HAWX,"My husband (yes, I said husband!) is an AVID Yu-Gi-Oh collector, as are our kids.  I purchased this for them for Christmas, and if DVD's could get worn out, this would have done so LONG ago.  I'm not a fan of the series, but judging by the looks of joy when the rest of my family watches these, they were an excellent buy.  Plus, the show is not violent, and the ""monsters"" (cards) are ""WAY cooler than anything on Pokemon"" according to my family.",1055721600,,447,4.2976190476190474
1756374,1,B00006HAWX,"After viewing both the japanese versions(with the literally translated subtitles) and the english versions of the first three episodes of Yu-Gi-Oh!: Duel Monsters(Which IS series 2; When an anime changes its name in Japan it's considered a new series), I can safely say that the Japanese version is more gripping than the English version. For starters, the most obvious changes were the voices. 'Duh', right? Well, compared to professionally made dubs like Disney's English dub of the anime masterpiece ""Spirited Away"", you can clearly see that 4Kids Entertainment(Their name tells so much..) did NOT put any time or effort into making it sound good or NATURAL. Its on par with the old Godzilla dubs for cryin' out loud!!!
Yugi is supposed to sound like a 15 year-old wimp, but 4Kids changed him to sound like a TWENTYFOUR-year old geek.(Typical, thats about the same age as Ted Lewis, the man who does his voice) Anzu Mazaki's voice is CUTE, Tea Gardner's voice is ANNOYING. Joey Wheeler sounds like a New Yorker while Jounouchi Katsuya sounds like a regular teenage delinquit. Tristan Taylor sounds like an idiot at first, but once the new dubbed voice comes in he sounds just like Honda Hiroto(Thank gosh). Pegasus and Mai both sound OK. Weevil is even more annoying in English(woah). Now for Kaiba Seto, he sounds okay when he's angry or mean, but when he tries to sound sweet or anything the English voice just sounds FAKE. Talk about campy... Plus, Yami Yugi doesn't sound like a dark, FRIGHTENING spirit in English. He now sounds like a Superfriend. :)
 But out of ALL my gripes with 4Kids, this takes the cake! They TOTALLY removed ALL of the original orchestrated, adventurous and dramatic Indiana Jones-like music and replaced it with this stupid MIDI techno [stuff] that sounds like something off the GameBoy Advance. For what reason, I don't know. PLUS, they went ahead and tried to cover up the pentagrams and gothic crosses with their pathetic computer animation attempts. YET they leave in The Eye?! WTH?!
Of course we all know about the edits to the guns and 'digital' monster gore and sharp objects(i.e: knives, buzzsaws). That just lowers the intensity of the danger at hand. In the japanese version the villians were so vicious and relentless that they made you HATE them and would make you wish Yami Yugi made them pay. But now they edit that stuff out for the kiddies who most of them wouldn't appreciate the deepness of the japanese version. They aren't GLORIFYING the violence, they want you to be AGAINST it, hence the VILLIANS doing the bad things. Besides, movies like Jurassic Park wouldn't be half as scary if they watered 'em down like 4Kids' Yu-Gi-Oh!.
 And OF COURSE there's gonna be 'obscure' Japanese references, because its an ANIME! From Japan! An if you don't understand 'em, go learn about 'em! They aren't gonna serve you everything on a silver platter! Anyways, there ARE many people who identify with the character's problems in Yu-Gi-Oh; who else hasn't been bullied before and wished they were stronger?(Like Yugi)
But as I meant, Yu-Gi-Oh isn't meant for YOUNG kids, though older ones will enjoy it. I mean, the original version even has cursing in it(Didn't the Casper movie have a whole lot more?!), but that's not all 4kids [messed] up. There was a movie that was a bridge inbetween series one and two where Yugi dueled Kaiba for the first time. It WASN'T in this first episode of series two where he was first introduced to Kaiba's technology.
In short, using [$$$] on a watered down, chopped up DVD that only includes the English and Spanish(WTH??) versions and trivial little extra facts that you probably already knew or could find easily on the internet, and a bad 'rap', isn't the way to go. Buy a deeper, more thought provoking anime. Or just wait 'till 4Kids ever allows Funimation Productions to release the original versions. Because for most people, its HARD to find imported stuff.",1052006400,7,3939,4.868852459016393
1756402,3,B00006HAWX,"For those who read the complaints about the story line, the editing, etc., remember that the US TV series skips quite a lot of character development.
To make up for it, I suggest people go and get all the back issues of Shonen Jump magazine (the US monthly), which starts with the first story of the manga in issue 1 (January 2003).  Yugi is actually 15 years old, but he's rather short and a late bloomer.  His grandfather owns a game store, and sells ""Magic & Wizards"" cards. The name Yugi actually means ""games"", and in the manga, his alter ego plays quite a few interesting ones...Also, the card game in the manga borrows VERY heavily from Magic: The Gathering (I'm surprised Wizards of the Coast didn't sue, and that they didn't get the US CCG licence...), including the card design. The US TV series skips about the first year's worth (50 or so chapters) of the manga...to go straight for the card battles.",1050364800,5,912,4.554878048780488
1756403,2,B00006HAWX,"While some anime makes it to America relatively unscathed, that is not true in Yu-Gi-Oh's case.  To correct someone elses review, there were not two seperate Yu-Gi-Oh series created, though the first episodes had a somewhat different flavor.  Kazuki Takahashi originally didn't even intend the series to be about cards, so the first hunk of the series doesn't include them.  The American dub is simply missing quite a few episodes, particularly the early ones.  The American version seems to have been redesigned simply to plug the card game.
While the content is more extreme, the original was still meant for all ages, Japan simply has different standards.  They, for the most part, are less sensitive about this sort of content.  I find our paranoia rather silly: Yu-Gi-Oh is popular in Japan also, and I don't here about their kids going on Yu-Gi-Oh induced drinking binges and killing sprees (ok, so I'm exaggerating, but you get the point).
What saddens me most is the loss of the beautiful voice acting.  In Japan, voice actors have as much fame and respect as regular actors, and their work is very high quality.  The woman who voices both Yugi and Yami Yugi is a personal favorite, Ogata Megumi.  She did a beautiful job portraying Yugi's two personalities.  The voices for the American version are simply the standard hero voices you here in any cartoon.
This dub is mostly suitable for young children who won't be able to keep up with subtitles or understand Japanese.  If you are older, however, find a copy of the original.  It's worth the effort.",1049760000,,1560,4.845283018867924
1756404,2,B00006HAWX,"Yu-Gi-Oh, as most everybody knows, is an anime shown on the KidsWB recently and has become a smash hit. However, whenever I watch the show I feel like I'm listening to a broken record (hence the title). If you watch the first episode, you basically have seen the entire series. The basic layout of the show is; Yugi morphs into Yu-Gi-Oh, the entity hidden within his Millenium puzzle which is actually an egyptian pharoah who loved games. So, whenever the moment arises, Yugi jumps into action, the entity takes control, and they win the cheesy battly in an episode or two. If you really want to know how it really started, you should subscribe to the new american Shonen Jump (which is an excellent reproduction and a good move by the Japanese publishers) which has the original Yu-Gi-Oh manga in its original format and content. I enjoy the Manga more than the series as in the manga nothing is censored and the manga starts from the BEGINNING of the storyline, not a year later. All in all, this show has been over-done, in every perspective. There isn't anything remarkable about the animation or music, and the repeating storyline is ZZZZZZ. If your a fan, go ahead buy it, you like the story, so you can remember it for all time, but if you're spmeone who is looking for a good flick, you outta pass this one up. Just go get Shonen Jump instead, it's about five times better anyway.",1048809600,2,1388,4.578313253012048

I used to have to wait for forever for the episodes to finally show the first on because there is many of them it takes forever1 Now if i wanna see the first episode that started the us craze i just pop this in! This is a great movie and a great start for an y yugioh fan!
There has been some comotion going on about the 1st series and the 2nd series and so on. It is true though because the first series in America is the second in japan. I have read the reviews and can see why they do not show on tv in america. Alos a few of my freinds told me that they cuss alot and there is alot of violence. Let me tell you the first series is chalk full of violenc! The second series though is not very violkent at all. They are trying to keep its good name in america as a show for pretty much all age groups. in japan it is mostly for  teens and adults. I have alos read some reviews and people are really dissing the us way of showing the episodes well if those people want violence and stuff why do they just go to japan and watch it there or buy the japanese versions of the episodes? and alos they say the parts were you can tell they are hoilding a gun and saying how dumb it looks i disagree. even though you can tell the gun is supposed to be there i am glad they deleted the guns. my mom would not let me watch the show otherwise and i am a teen!

1756406,5,B00006HAWX,"I must say, Im not a typical Anime fan.  In fact I used to be so totally agianst Anime that I stopped attending Science Fiction conventions because they showed heavy Anime.
Yu-Gi-Oh, in my opinion IS NOT a show for children.  Even with alot cut out of the shows in 4-Kids entertainment's kiddy-fied version, the story lines are way too deep for most children to understand.  What average 8-year-old is going to understand a grief-striken mans desperate attempts to get back his late wife?  How are they going to understand an Acient Egyptian Pharoh's inhabiting a 11-year old boy's mind, and not to mention the fact that he hangs out with friends who are way older than him.
The show is good though.. I happend to catch it one day and got hooked, majorly.  I'd recomend it for children atleast 16 and up, forget the children!",1042329600,,825,4.623287671232877
1756407,1,B00006HAWX,this dvd is horrible. who needs this kiddie stuff when they have a whole series that is very dark and very great. the only problem is that no one can seem to get a hold of this long lost series. if anyone knows how to get a copy of the series please notify me. thank you.,1038009600,4,271,3.857142857142857
1756408,5,B00006HAWX,"When I first saw the previews for this show on the WB, I was intrigued. I hate to admite it, but I was. I'm definately NOT your average Yu-Gi-Oh! viewer, and upon the first viewing of the show, I wasn't all that impressed. I found the  english dialogue cheesy and frankly didn't want to get up in time to see it on saturday mornings. But, thanks to losing my cable, I started watching it regularly. I was rather surprised by how well done the dub was, and that's saying a lot coming from a ""purist."" And the fact that the WB had taken the chance with another anime after the hidious Cardcaptors dub showed great courage. Of course, I'm just happy to see ANY new anime being introduce to American audiences. (gotta get'em early, ne?)
Of course, my growing obsession with the world of Yu-Gi-Oh! has peeked my interest in the original version of the series, leading to the purchase of season 2 and season 3 (Japan) on DVD. While I personally prefer the original version, despite the subtittling that reads like it was translated from the chinese subtittles, I understand the changes made for the transition to the American audience. And overall, I must applaude the production crew for keeping the spirit of the show intact. (Cardcaptors on the other hand had its spirit crushed...) There are a few things about the NA version that do bug me, however, such as a few slight changes in characterization and the blatent digital painting out of weapons despite the fact that you KNOW he's supposed to be holding a gun, and that everyone talks WAY too much.
But overall, if you're looking for something that is ""safe"" to show your children the NA dub of Yu-Gi-Oh! if very much what you are looking for. Just don't be surprised if afterwards they start begging for cards, posters, etc.",1036022400,4,1776,4.620253164556962
1756409,2,B00006HAWX,"There has been some major controversy surrounding the new kids craze ""Yu-Gi-Oh!""  It's populer, it's anime, it's hasn't gotten beyond the point of being anything more of a card commercial, and the only way to (Currently) get it in America is dubbed/edited.  If it sounds like I'm a crazed otaku who's going to eat this dub apart like I have many others before me, then you're only half correct.  I'd simply like to address the controversy surrounding the show, and my personal opinion of it too.  For starters let's get this ""season 1"" thing out of the way.
Like one reviewer has already pointed out there was never a ""season 1,"" there was another series altogether.  And yes the original series was very dark, and not anything like the second (And still going strong) series turned out to be, but it was still a very good show.  And I don't really blame 4Kids for skipping it, because if they didn't then we'd have a REAL mess on out hands!  The problem with skipping the first series was that, contrary to popular belief, the first series was VERY importent!
It explained what the Millinium Puzzle was, what it did, the history of the games, and the way Dark Yugi thought and acted.  All this was axed to get straight to the card battles, which left little room for plot development.  The charater's were introduced as quick as 5 minutes, and then 5 minutes after that the card battle starts.  So for an entire season this show already leaves the impression that ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" is nothing more then a simple card commercial, and will never be anything more.  It's true that the Dual Kingdom Saga WAS like one long card commercial, and if you ask anyone who was a fan of ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" before it was brought over to the states then they'll tell you that this saga is the one they least enjoyed.
Because despite the original series being so good, series 2 of ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" was such a blant commercial for the cards they had the charater's go to a CARD SHOP of all things, and buy a truckload of cards!  And while the show has it's touching moments (Like the story behind Peggasis's wife), there are many moments that prove to be painful to watch (This whole ""save the world by playing a card game"" is such utter garbage you get sick of it).  The voice acting doesn't help with the credibility of the show since it's so aweful.
All the character's sound weird and forced beyond belief.  There is not ONE person who sounds like a human being in this dub!  To tell you the truth I even suspect that there may be one guy doing all the guys in the show, and one girl doing all of the girls in the show.  It would make perfect sense since the charater's sound fake beyond belief.  Odviously if they ever dub this uncut they might simply want to hire a new cast so that they won't look ridicules.  The music is also bland, with no emotion to be found anywhere.  The music cues sound kind of random to tell you the truth.
Now let's talk about the editing of the show, which is very mild, but also poorly done.  Many people have complained about the following things found in the Japanese version: Guns, cursing, and culteral refferences that don't make sense.  All these have been taken care of...a little.  What little cursing there was has been deleated.  I have no problem with this.  The Japanese refferences were taken out too.  I also have no real problem with this.  The guns have been taken out, but in such a silly way that I wonder why they even bothered to take them out.  You see all they did was take out the guns, but the people are still there gripping on to thin air.
Not only that, but they are also making ""threats"" while they grasp nothing but thin air.  Even things like ""Stay where you are"" and ""Give me all your money!""  Seriously folks, these are threats you make when you've got GUNS to threaten people with!  And since everyone is still holding the thin air where the gun used to be they might as well of just kept them in.  Trust me folks, your kids will know that the men were originaly holding guns, it doesn't take a rocket scientest to figure it out.  So besides the dub being a very adverage dub, 4Kids decided that they'd start with the worst season of ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" out there.
Trust me people, this is not the full potential ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" has to offer.  Later episodes get much better, and I will be waiting for them to see if those will give the show much more respect.  As it stands at the moment though, ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" is simply nothing more then a card commercial.  So will the real ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" please stand up?  And please show us the greatness you are capable of.",1035936000,5,4579,4.448441247002398
1756410,5,B00006HAWX,"Yu-Gi-Oh! is one of those anime that, once you get into it, you can't get yourself out of its grasp. This DVD will prove it from the get-go.
Yu-Gi-Oh! got started first in 1996 with the manga (comics series), then an initial TV series (which YGO fans dub 'Season 0"") which flopped. Once the Duel Monsters concept was thrown into the story, Yu-Gi-Oh! took off like a rocket!  The sales numbers out of Japan speak for themselves.
Finally now, Yu-Gi-Oh! fever has hit the U.S. of A. and it's clearly evident. The TV series took awhile to gain the upper hand over its competition, but KidsWB seemed to know what they were doing, and after a silght timeslot change on Saturday AM, adding a 2nd showing there, and adding the 5-day-a-week showings, it's become a ratings killer, smashing records previously set by Pokemon, and beating out the competition!  The CCG is selling out to the point where it's somtimes impossible to find unless you live in a real huge city with a lot of shops, and just recently, a CD soundtrack (""Yu-Gi-Oh!: Music to Duel By"") has been released. Search this site out for it and snatch that up too, it's good listening.
Anyways, this DVD is a good introduction to this now highly popular anime. The first episode I'd already deem a 'classic'...the first of many confrontations between Kaiba (Seto) and Yugi, armed with the ever-powerful EXODIA in his deck!
Ep 2 gives us a Duel between Yugi and Pegasus, and Ep 3, the group of friends: Yugi, Joey, Tristan, & Ta, set off for Duelist Kingdom.
The video is probably best veiwed on a hi-definition TV (HDTV) although it still looks fine on normal TVs. (Of course everyone's eyes are different, so, maybe it just looked fuzzy / grainy to my eyes on my TV). The sound is mostly to the center, although the music is digitally recorded in surround-stereo.
There's 2 flavors to choose from as far as language goes: English and Spanish. There's also a quick music video here, as well as some monster and character profiles. The dub (English) is great...certainly one of 4Kids' great accomplishments, and they should be proud of their work. Many anime 'purists' are not going to like the fact that there's no Japanese track here (then again, it seems most of them are against dubs in general). I don't mind this at all though, since I've been, as I stated at the start of this review, a casual anime viewer for over 6 years and I'd find the dub more comfortable to sit through. As a previous reviewer here has stated (and I have learned from fans who've seen the Japanese version episodes), that the Japanese variant of Yu-Gi-Oh! is just way too dark, way too controversial for the rest of the world to grasp. After finding out all that I have about Yu-Gi-Oh! in its original format, I'd still probably stick with the English adaption.
With all this said, this DVD's worth it. However...there is one minor gripe here that I have. You only get 3 eps. I""ve delved deep into how DVD technology works, and....you could easily get 5-6 eps on a single-layer DVD. That's my only gripe, and unfortunately, I suppose it's the company's way of doing things, and nothing can change that. Other popular anime like DBZ are like this too, and look what's happened to that...its up to Vol 90 for what its worth...go figure!

7968624,3,B00006HAWX,"To anyone who has watched Yu-Gi-Oh and thinks it's an American production, I'm here to shatter that assumnption,  this is Japanese. Is there anything wrong with this, no. This show was originally created by Kazuki Takahashi and then dubbed and (to many) ruined by 4 Kids (greedy corparate money handlers who want to make a quick buck by spoiling a Japanese anime). Most people totally hate this show but I actually don't think it's that bad. The American voices are terribly annoying, however. Annoying little edits are made in the script that turn the story into even more of a nonsense than it already is. people say it was better with: guns, knives, blood, and death. I've wathced the original anime and I can't help agreeing with them, at least there the story makes a little more sense. Again about the edits, these would be fine if they were actually done well. As some people mentioned, guns are removed, but the gestures made still suggest a gun is in the person's hand, but there is none. 4 Kids apparently thought that since this is for kids they won't notice. Unfortunately they are, in some cases right. As an avid watcher of this show as a kid, I didn't notice. But something 4 Kids overlooked, kids grow up and then they notice it very much. As others have mentioned, 4 Kids is very elusive of even the word death, or anything pertaining to the subject. Instead of dying, people go to the Shadow Realm, a magical place that no one bothered to explain about. So basically, we've got immortal duelists, highly edited monsters, people threatening eachother with invisible guns, and highly obnoxious voices. Not bad, but not good either. If you ask me, 4 Kids should do with Funimation did, and release uncut seasons, to increase the Yu-Gi-Oh fan base (and line their pockets). Or they can doom Yu-Gi-Oh to a slow death, In AMERICA!",1271721600,,1842,4.685185185185185
7968625,5,B00006HAWX,"Yu-Gi-Oh! is a great TV series, but not just for kids - I have found out that many adults have too become addicted to the show.  The series is about a young high school boy named Yugi Motou who enjoys playing the popular card game: Duel Monsters.  However, things turn topsy-turvy for Yugi and his three best friends (Joey, Tea, and Tristan) when he -someone who has never even entered a tournament- wins a ""duel"" (a game of Duel Monsters) against the World Champion, Seto Kaiba.  People start wondering how an amateur could win against someone so experienced at the game.  Maximillion Pegasus, the inventor of the game, becomes extremely impressed with Yugi and invites him to the newest Duel Monsters tournament, taking place at Pegasus's very own island...Duelist Kingdom!  Unfortunately, not everything is simply about a card game.  Pegasus is the owner of the Millennium Eye, an ancient Egyptian artifact that holds incredible powers.  There are 7 of these artifacts (Yugi possessing the powerful Millennium Puzzle) that will give supreme power to anyone who holds all 7.  Unbeknownst to Yugi, his favorite card game (Duel Monsters) isn't a modern card game - it is suspiciously linked to the 7 Egyptian artifacts, as the card game was actually played in Ancient Egypt thousands of years ago...but with real monsters!  Pegasus sucks the soul out of Yugi's grandfather, forcing him to enter in the Duelist Kingdom tournament to win back his grandpa's spirit.  But poor Yugi has no idea that Pegasus is after his Millennium Puzzle - which is the home to the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle (Yugi's alter ego).  Here are the episodes included on this DVD:

1.  ""THE HEART OF THE CARDS""
2.  ""THE GAUNTLET IS THROWN""
3.  ""JOURNEY TO DUELIST KINGDOM""

This DVD is really good because it contains some very fantastic episodes.  The only let-down is that there are only 3 episodes, each 20 minutes long.  In other words, it is only 1 hour for $20; but you can purchase all 49 episodes of the entire first season in a special edition box set.  Besides that minor disappointment, this DVD is a great purchase because of its content.  Yu-Gi-Oh! is an awesome show, very well-thought  and with a phenomenal not-something-you-see-every-day-but-you-still-end-up-loving-it kind of plot.  It is very well written and was apparently good enough to be translated into English.  There are unnoticeable clues hidden in these first three episodes that foreshadow later events at the end of the season (see Grandpa`s poster in Episode 2) and even things in Seasons 2 and 5!!!  This is a great DVD for any Yu-Gi-Oh! fan, or for anyone who enjoys a good cartoon.  Plus, anyone can watch it becomes you have the choise of playing the epsiodes in English or Spanish!  Despite some negative reviews, this is a pretty addicting show - but it won't make sense unless you see these first episodes!  Season 1 of Yu-Gi-Oh! is simply ""wow""-worthy!
