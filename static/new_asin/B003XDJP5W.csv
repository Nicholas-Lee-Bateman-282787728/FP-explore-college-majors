The first is Polish country itself which filled with mafia, poor people, suicides, dilapidated building; the second main character obsession with his finding of old, supposedly 2500 years old corpse which he declare a shaman; the third the director manage to connect unprovable events in that shaman's life to his characters lives; the fourth is female character itself which has mental problems but somehow nobody pays attention anyway as supposedly men attracted to her and are trying to have sex because of her animal magnetism. And sexual part is most depressing where the director stick to self-sensoring or maybe he don't understand anything in sex anyway and i don't want even mention the movie's end and, in short, its all in the past.
Yes, if you looking for something more appropriate for 21 century try ""Enter the void""",1299974400,,1030,4.792134831460674

The movie will stick with you and you will get urges to watch it again. Only real complaint is that it maybe is 15 mins to long.",1480032000,,245,4.23404255319149

8407942,3,B003XDJP5W,Meh...  It's not bad but a little weak.  There's clearly something lost between the book and the movie.,1448928000,,103,4.666666666666667
8407943,5,B003XDJP5W,"Fascinating! A shocking and unhinged, multi-faceted movie about sex and shamans with deep political roots. Szamanka is extreme in many ways; Zulawski's films are not for the masses, and in order to appreciate a film such as this, one must be open minded and willing to watch it multiple times to absorb all of the chaotic visual undertones. Its well worth the effort though! The writing sounds too intelligent at times, a bit unrealistic, but I believe that certainly was the purpose, given the story and its political statements. Petry gives a mesmerizing and electric performance, out-shining everybody else onscreen.  You won't forget this film for a long time!",1448582400,,664,5.091743119266055

Criterion Collection watch out!!!",1361232000,3,168,5.72
8407947,3,B003XDJP5W,"This movie is a puzzle to me. It had somewhat of a good story line and acting is not too bad. Here are the things made me say WTF. Almost everyone in the movie acting crazy! I mean, really, they are acting like they have mental illness. Lead character female is not exception either. it was weird. the other character, male counter part was acting normal but he had issues as well. If you ignore the fact that majority of the society are crazy in this movie; basic story line is an almost like mummyfied body found in an archeological dig. Assumed based on tattoos on his body, he is a Shaman. A religious man of the Earth's past. I would not want to reveal the entire movie here. But somehow, movie makes a good connection with archeologist's life and dead Shaman. They both get or end up with same faith too. Movie has nudity and somewhat revealing sex scenes. No male frontal nudity only female. Some brief sex scenes, again it is below the soft porn standards but little above simple R rated movie. Should you buy it or rent it? Yes. You should. This will not be waste of your money.",1352592000,,1087,4.359605911330049
8407948,5,B003XDJP5W,"The MondoVision release of Polish director Andrzej Zulawski's film 'Szamanka' is a great product - the packaging, film transfer quality & 'extras' are all first class. The film itself is very complex and enigmatic and can stand several viewings to appreciate and start to understand it.  I got a lot out of the  'extras' included in the package that featured interviews with both the director and the screenplay writer as to what they were trying to get across via the film, as well as some written third party analysis. Still, even armed with behind the scenes knowledge, the actual viewing experience is pretty wild.  The principle themes appear to address issues of religion (particularly Catholicism), life in post communist eastern Europe, obsessive relationships and SEX. I've only seen two of Zulawski's films - the other being 'La Femme Publique' - but based on these I'd have to say that he seems to draw rather manic performances from his female leads.  The female 'star' of Szamanka, Iwona Petry, (who Zulawski apparently cast in a situation reminiscent of Carl Denham and Anne Darrow in 'King Kong') has a frenetic energy that is somewhat disquieting & disengenuous on first vivewing (like, what is with this chick!?)... and there is not much of an attempt made in the movie to explain her way of being.  She does kind of 'grow on you' though with subsequent viewings. While grittilly realistic on some levels the film is also quite surreal and hallucinatory on others.  It is one of  the marks of good film-making that everything doesn't just wrap up in a nice tidy package and 'Szamanka' certainly leaves the viewer with much to contemplate in its' aftermath.  The film has a highly charged erotic atmosphere and there are many scenes where the beautiful Ms Petry is naked and having vigorous simulated sex.  The movie was apparently very controversial in its' day, and one can see why - it is unabashed and transgressive in its' approach to sensitive subject matter. All in all a brilliant piece of film-making that makes me want to check out more of Zulawski's work.",1311120000,5,2082,4.892045454545454
8407949,5,B003XDJP5W,"Finally, we have the full UNCUT special edition of Zulawski's beloved film on DVD thanks to Mondo Vision, who have done their absolute best to ensure proper releases for a great deal of Zulawski's catalog. Now we are hoping for a long-awaited re-release for Possession as it's been out of print for some time and perhaps a re-packaging of Diabel or The Silver Globe as the Polart releases left much to be desired considering Zulawski's film are nothing less than brilliant works to be cherished by film lovers' across the world.

As is made clear on the disc, Mondo Vision refused a couple of prints of the film before settling on the master used here. Restored for dirt, debris and noise, the result is an improvement over previous DVD releases for which praise may only be qualified by the comparison with previous Mondo releases.

Szamanka's packaging resembles some of Criterion's early works with the sturdy cardboard box exterior. Even more impressive, we are bequeathed interviews with both screenplay writer and director. Although I can't comment on the deluxe editon, special is the operative word in the special edition.

Ironically, this is the only film that Zulawski has ever made in his native country where it generated much controversy due to the explicit sexuality. Unfortunately, the film had a limited theatrical release and sold about 400,000 tickets. In France, the film had a limited theatrical release and sold 11,150 tickets. Szamanka was also screened during the Venice Film Festival in 1996. Naturally, this wasn't the first time Zulawski was attacked or criticized for making unconvetional artwork so it's truly a blessing for us to see this film at all.

For Zulawski,Szamanka was to be a film ""without masks"". Returning to his native Poland, Andrzej Zulawski asked Manuela Gretkowska to write a screenplay for him to film in the now post communist 1990s. Given the use of a writer other than himself and another country, it is surprising how much Szamanka shares with Zulawski's earlier work and at times even recalls his celebrated film Possession. Although it's almost impossible or even perverse to admit, Iwona Petry's performance at times mirrors the Adjani's masterful turn in Possession.

Iwona Prety plays the ""Italian"" and I don't think we ever learn her name throughout the course of 112 mins. At least, I don't recall any mention of it. In fact, we learn very little the yuong woman's background other than the fact she supposedly makes the hottest pizzas and tends to be rather high strung. One can only gather from a few short scenes that our female comes from a dysfunctional family which could explain her sudden emotional outbursts or tendency to steal. Lastly, The Italian's strong addiction to sexual intercourse of any kind with virtually anyone making her a loose cannon and unstable rather than completely vulnerable as viewers might believe.

In the beginning of Szamanka, the Italian meets a young but very engaged anthropology professor Michal during her search for an apartment. She accepts the apartment offered which was previously occupied by his brother, a priest. The scene culminates with a rather intense but erotic sex scene. As anyone can guess, this is not the last time our characters' paths shall cross nor is this a one time fling.

Michal spends his afternoons giving lectures on the human body, studying mental illness, and even takes part in an excavation with his tudents where a well-preserved body of 3,000 year old shaman is found. Unable to initially pinpoint the shaman's death, Michal is determined to examine the body with his students which seems unnatural given that the shaman was only 25-30 years old when he expired.

With each montage, it becomes more and more evident that our Italian will not be satisfied with a mere tryst and is determined to have the young professor at all costs. Although Michal does take her seemingly uneding sexual needs for granted and makes light of the Italian's intensifying obsession, he cannot bring himself to stay away and even takes some comfort in the fact that she is literally taken by him and his sexual prowess.

Within days, Michal's life spirals completely out of control. We learn that his brother was a priest and an active homosexual although he couldn't straddle the two worlds and ends up commiting suicide. Unable to cope with the loss of his brother, Michal continues his obsessive love affair with the Italian and even proceeds to move in her apartment. In turn, he severs his relationship with the fiance.

Zulawski's film carefully examines how relationships are often elements of destruction and even well-meaning people get caught up in the aspects of love which jeopardize our health or relationships with others. Not only does he focus on the unhealthy or unnatural circumstances which are repurcussions but he shows how the forces of good and evil are almost always present in any given situation. Although a severed relationship is inevitable, Szamanka demands to explore the darkest recesses of hallucinations and delusion when we look to love as our final statement in defining who we are or what we really need.

Perhaps one of the most beautiful scenes in Szamanka is towards the end of the film where Michal comes in contact with the spirit of the shaman. During this illumination, we learn the cause of the shaman's death and perhaps this is a mere foreshadowing of what will happen to Michal if he doesn't let go of his current obsession. Although it's merely just a dream or altered illusion rather than a reality, there's a great deal of validity to be found in this montage.

Having said that, Zulawski doesn't seem to be content in just exploring the nature of obssesive relations but also manages to tackle the then current states of affairs in Poland which should have been another spark of controversy and large notch in his continuous belt of censorship although there is no mention of it anywhere to the best of my knowledge at this present time. In a few scenes, it becomes blatantly obvious that our director could see all too well the oppressive politics or shady doings in his native country which seem to fit in nicely in the grand scheme of things.

In conclusion, Szamanka doesn't end on a happy note but it's certain that horror film enthusiasts everywhere or fans of great cinema in general are going to love this if they give it a try. I would perhaps suggest watching Zulawski's Possession first as primer before taking on Szamanka although both films are revolutionary works of a master's art in top form. Do not pass up your chance to see this film.",1300752000,10,6620,4.926457399103139
