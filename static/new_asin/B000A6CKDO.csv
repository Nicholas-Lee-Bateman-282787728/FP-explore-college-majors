8074860,4,B000A6CKDO,Michelle Bauer gives a really good performance as the evil Egyptian sorceress. Too bad she never got any other roles as good as this.,1361750400,,133,4.583333333333333
8074861,2,B000A6CKDO,"I had this vhs movie years ago, I got it for the sole purpose of Sybil Danning being in it,
yeah for like 5 minutes. The only plus is Russ Meyer vixen Kitten Natividad playing a topless dancer, that made up for what I payed for it but the movie blah.",1345248000,,250,3.9215686274509802
8074862,3,B000A6CKDO,"A fairly straight forward plot here. The Goddess Nefratis ( played by Michelle Bauer) has her tomb raided by 2 profit/greed stricken scumbags. Their interference energizes & awakens her. Thus begins the Goddess's search for her stolen artifacts which when assembled ( of course with a hot human sacrifice on hand)will cement her retaining her beauty & immortality from then on. As the pursuit goes on so climbs the body count. This was the first Fred Olen Ray film I encountered that was shot as an adventure & not a comedy, no yucks here. It marks the first time I remember Michelle Bauer having the story be about her, so she is front & centre & get to show off her acting chops. She does a good job. It's a nice change to see her other then as a topless cavewoman or comedic vampire, although the fangs are present here to. Other notable thespians on board are John Carridine, Sybil Danning & Kitten Natividad ( a different act with Kitten but still great). All three above have one scene Cameos & it was especially sad to see Sybil out of the movie after a couple of minutes. On the plus side check out the dazzling Kitten striptease in the bar ( it has nothing to do with the plot or movie but we know why its there).Cameron Mitchell has a significant role as a professor/Egyptian artifact collector who has all the illegal connections to augment his collection. Again a superb actor & he is pretty good, good casting choice. Others in the film are Dawn Wildsmith, David pearson & Susan Stokey. For me to get a 4 or 5 star review generally it has to be a movie either you would dole out hard cash for or if in your possession you would watch again. I come down on the no side both times & 3 stars seems fair. Simply stated there are not enough revisit moments on this 1986 videocassette but maybe a DVD could boost things. 3 stars for now!",1283212800,,1844,4.394736842105263
8074863,4,B000A6CKDO,"Although Sybil Danning appears on the cover, she only has a cameo in the pre-credit sequence. John Carradine is at his best and Cameron Mitchell has a fairly decent role. Michelle Bauer in captivating and believable. One hopes this will eventually be released on DVD.",1255219200,3,267,4.955555555555556
8074864,5,B000A6CKDO,"The plot is creative, the language crude and Ms. Mummy ""Michelle Bauer"" the best evil princess you ever want to meet in this low budget B string horror  film. But it is absolutely a cult classic. Some of the phrases like ""do you have a light"" toward the end are priceless. The music is good. If you want a  entertaining evening just put it in the machine and watch. My only regret is it is not in DVD like the Phontom Empire.",1198281600,3,425,4.170731707317073
