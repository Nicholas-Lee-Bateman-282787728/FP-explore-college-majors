8537587,3,B000BKVRPG,"An enjoyable, light-hearted, Spanish languge romp featuring plenty of music by Infante and others.  Two men fight over Teresa while Jesusita pines for one of them and despises the other.  The filmmaker really did a good job of disguising how it would end up.  I wasn't sure until the very end who would end up with whom.

In general, I really like classic Mexican cinema, especially Pedro Infante films.  This one, while not as witty as ""Escuela de Vagabundos,"" was still very good (and better than 98% of Mexican films produced after 1970).

One thing that peeved me, though, was the East West Entertainment-produced DVD.  Not only was the sound muddy, the picture quality needed some adjustment.  At one point, a letter is shown on-screen, but it is illegible.  What really frosted me, however, was that the DVD cut off a few minutes before the end of the movie, depriving the viewer of the last scene and any ending credits.",1199145600,,927,4.74375
