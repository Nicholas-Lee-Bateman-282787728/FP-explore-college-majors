Crass, profane, All you need! --- I had resulted to buying bootleg VHS copied on Ebay years ago( as Jay Mohr once sugested)....nice to clean dvd  quality with out the bleeeeeps.

Hey Jay -- you once told me this would never make it to dvd beacuse of the two studios fighting over $$$$ ---glad you were wrong my friend!!!!",1138492800,5,462,4.987012987012987
2470011,5,B000CQQI8K,"I originally saw this series when I was living in Taiwan. I just came across it one night and was instantly hooked. I've been trying to get hold of it ever since. None of my friends in the UK have ever heard of it. As soon as it comes out, I'll get everybody round and show them what I've been raving on about.",1136592000,4,310,3.9365079365079363
2470012,5,B000CQQI8K,"My friend used to send me a mish-mash of shows taped from comedy central, and on there were three stray episodes of this insanely funny show! I got so hooked just off of those 3 episodes that I have literally been looking around for years for the rest of the lot. Sly cynical black humour, this is one of the most unique and truly hillarious shows I have seen in a long long time. I hope enough people buy the DVD's that someone decides to pick it back up, this show is truly of that caliber, even funnier than (dare I say it) Family Guy.",1136073600,5,538,4.133333333333334
2470013,5,B000CQQI8K,"I am so glad this cruelly under-watched show is coming to DVD; my treasured third-generation VCR copy of the complete series is showing signs of wear from my having watched it so many times.  This show was way too smart for its own good and maybe a few years ahead of its time.

Jay Mohr was absolutely perfect as producer Peter Dragon.  The rest of the regular cast (including Ileana Douglas, R. Lee Ermey, and even the late Buddy Hackett) were uniformly marvelous.  Even the more minor characters were brilliantly cast: nobody who saw characters like Asher, the supercilious maitre 'd, or the Chinese-American liposuctionist, or the fearsome PR fixer Connie Hunt, or terrifyingly well-endowed studio head Bobby Z, or closeted action hero Cole Riccardi will ever forget them.  The guest stars (Salma Hayek, Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Tony Hawk, etc.) were fearless participants in sly send-ups of the Hollywood that they are themselves such a large part of.

But the real stars were the writers.  The show seems like it's all about Peter Dragon, but it's just as much the story of nebbish writer Adam Rafkin (or was it Alan Rifkin?...).  Fighting to retain every sensitive allegorical scene in his magnum opus, BEVERLY HILLS GUN CLUB (like the ritual slaughter of the pandas), Rafkin is the perfect counterpart to Dragon's consummate amoral Hollywood insider.  While Rafkin is trying desperately to become an insider and starts to lose his moral compass, Dragon (to his considerable surprise) starts to find that he actually *has* a moral compass, even if it doesn't always point true north.

This show is hilarious, knowing, occasionally vicious, brilliantly written, superbly acted, and a real treat for anyone who loved THE PLAYER or DAY OF THE LOCUSTS.  Having it on DVD is going to be great.  If you love CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS, or ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, ACTION! is likely to be right up your alley.  If, on the other hand, you loved EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND...um....have a nice life.",1134950400,80,2010,5.018072289156627

2470019,5,B000CQQI8K,"Hilarious, yet short-lived Fox series and probably one of the best parts I've seen Jay Mohr play - though keep in mind this series is from the 90's when humor wasn't so politically correct, so if you're easily offended by crass/crude humor, save yourself the grief and look for something a little more tame.  Though, like Ozzy Osborne's reality show, a lot of the fun watching the original airings was deciphering what was bleeped out by the network censors, the DVD version is uncensored.",1436659200,,489,4.821428571428571

Action is a heartless, tasteless comedy with humor that will go just about anywhere.  It is meant to skewer the entertainment industry.  Jay Mohr appears to be well suited for the lead.  Veteran Buddy Hackett is pretty much wasted here.  Talented actress I. Douglas gives her best in a campy sort of way.

This is a series with a cult following for cruel sarcasm.  Its audience was small and deservedly so.  It was cancelled after 13 episodes. The show was originally intended to run on HBO.",1406419200,,641,4.56140350877193

Though it is great fun even the funny but rude remarks become a bit more of the samenafter a while. Therefore I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. If possible I would have given a 5 minus. It stands out from other. Hollywood spoofs because of the idiotic situations,

The plot of each episode is great and all characters are fantastic. The appearances of some stars like Sandra Bullock make it really special and they truly add to the fun. Not every star would participate in a series which would depict Hollywood in such a sarcastic way.

Its a pity the series lasted only for one season. Its great the series is on dvd now.

Jah Mohr does a great job and this may be one of his better roles ever.

2470062,4,B000CQQI8K,One of the smartest comedies that I have ever seen.

2470063,5,B000CQQI8K,"Loosely inspired by tales from real-life producer Joel Silver, Fox's critically-acclaimed but low-rated ""Action"" deftly and hilariously spoofed all facets of the Hollywood movie-making process for a single season of 13 episodes. Each episode just as brilliant as the next, Action follows hotshot producer Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr) and his efforts to get a much-needed next great blockbuster film (""Beverly Hills Gun Club"") up on the big screen. Featuring a great cast and crew plus celebrity guest stars cool enough to laugh at themselves for the viewer's amusement (My favorite: Sandra ""Sandy"" Bullock storming into Peter's office with a copy of their 'leaked' sex tape Peter made without her knowledge), the show is littered with bits of laugh-out-loud humor yet comes with the following Viewer Warning: 'Portions of ""Action"" may be inappropriate for younger viewers. This program is recommended for mature audiences'. Best described by TV Guide as ""a raw, bawdy riot"", Action - The Complete Series (Uncut & Unbleeped!) is a 2-disc (299 min.) set which contains all 13 episodes, Full Frame (1.33:1) video, English Stereo audio, Closed Captioning, plus the following Special Features: Episodic Filmmaker's Commentaries, Making of Featurette, and Interactive ""Hollywood Insider"" Dictionary.

2470064,5,B000CQQI8K,"This series is a blast for movie buffs.  Virtually all good jokes here are insider info.  Series names names with abandon and cuts to the humor bone.  A 'must see"" for any on in the ""industry"" because it is about you.
Probably children will ask ""what does ... mean?"" so put them to bed early or be prepared to explain many off-color juicy jokes.  Just buy this one!",1265500800,,365,4.323529411764706
2470065,5,B000CQQI8K,"One might make a serious drama about the movie-making business, but a nasty satire is so much more fun. The material is virtually self-satirizing, anyway. (Many of the incidents are supposedly true, related to the writers by Joel Silver.) The series' running joke (or underlying conceit, if you want to get literary about it), is that the only decent, honest, self-aware character is Wendy -- a prostitute. Billy Wilder -- who co-wrote and directed ""Sunset Blvd."", another black comedy about the movie business -- would have loved ""Action"".

It's unfortunate the series was cancelled, as we don't see whether ""Beverly Hills Gun Club"" is ever completed. It presumably would have been, as the series' producer hoped to actually film the movie!

The interview with the producer (Chris Thompson) is strange. He almost always looks down and refuses to face the interviewer, confessing that ""Action"" appeared on Fox, rather than HBO, because Fox offered more money. This is probably true, but it's hard to tell whether his other self-deprecating remarks are.

Amazon's NC-17 rating is absurd. (The package is labelled ""No Rating"".) This is a TV-MA (R) show. However, the disclaimer at the beginning that ""Portions of 'ACTION' may be inappropriate for younger viewers"" is wrong --/everything/ in ""Action"" is inappropriate for younger viewers.

This is one of those programs that's ""too good for television"". Unreservedly recommended.

PS: Joss Whedon did a movie (""Serenity"") based on a failed series (""Firefly""). So why /shouldn't/ we eventually see a film of ""Beverly Hills Gun Club""?",1252800000,,1579,5.25

2470067,5,B000CQQI8K,"I was going through all of my old VHS tapes and almost ""bleeped"" myself when I found my old ""Action"" tape.  I forgot about the series a long time ago because my VHS tapes have been collecting dust for years.  I've been a fan of ""Entourage"" since its inception and wondered all these years why Jeremy Piven's Ari Gold reminded me so much of an old friend of mine even though I never had a friend like him.  It was because Jay Mohr's Peter Dragon set the standard for the ""bleep"" Hollywood big wig who everyone knew by name and reputation, but whose face was always hidden.  Given more episodes and a cable network that could have allowed the writers more freedom, ""Entourage"" could have served as the perfect little brother to ""Action"" if it had been on for five or six seasons as it should have.  Unfortunately it was just too sharp, brash and real for pg-13 audiences back in 1999 and I guess not enough people wanted their hollywood bubble to be burst.  Instead we can thank Hugh Grant, Russell Crowe, Tom Cruise, Winona Ryder, Britney and anyone else that showed us that the big stars, no matter how big, are just as human and messed up as the rest of us.  Even though Buddy Hackett is no longer with us, the main stars are, and if anyone has any sense, they'll bring them back for the ""Action"" feature movie and give all the remaining fans a little closure to the best inside hollywood parody that never was.",1248307200,,1412,4.407692307692308

2470069,4,B000CQQI8K,"""Action"" is yet another one of those great TV series that you've never heard of because it got cancelled almost as soon as it began. The 13 episodes of this series tell the continuing story of Hollywood movie producer Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr) and his attempts to make the seemingly doomed action film ""Beverly Hills Gun Club"" (the description of which sounds so incredibly bad and trashy that if it really existed I would be the first in line at the cinema to see it) by ""selling his soul to the devil one piece at a time"".

""Action"" is an incredibly funny series. It skewers all of the top names in Hollywood (at the time it was made - 1999), as well as the film industry in general, and doesn't hold back in doing so. Each episode targets a different aspect of showbiz - from actors, to directors, to investors, to writers. No one is spared. The show is completely offensive and is up to its eyeballs in coarse language and sex and drug references, not to mention jokes that are just in plain bad taste - I don't mean gross-out humour, I mean jokes that make you stop and think ""I can't believe they just said that"", right before bursting out laughing.

The reason why I didn't give this show five stars is because, even though I thoroughly enjoyed this series, the show did start to run out of steam towards the end. The episodes on disc two just aren't as funny as the episodes on disc one, and Illeana Douglas, as child star turned prostitute turned film executive, Wendy Ward (my favourite character in the series, played by one of my favourite actresses) ""vanishes"" from several episodes on the second disc. Nevertheless, by the time I got to disc two, I was so interested in finding out what the next disaster to befall Peter Dragon would be, that the story kept me going in place of the jokes.",1218153600,2,1801,4.454545454545454

""I prefer to think of the sack being half full"" - Buddy Hackett in his deadpan innocence.

""You're threatening me? That's a laugh... I'm seventy-nine years old. I've got one kidney, one ball and one lung. I take Viagra just to keep from peeing on my shoes, and you're threatening me? Who are you frightening? "" - Uncle Lonnie (Hackett)

""Look, Wendy, I want you to come work for me. Not as a prostitute, no, no, no. I want you to work for me as a motion picture executive, which is just a different kind of prostitute. "" - Jay Mohr as Peter Dragon

""You can be a prostitute and humiliate yourself as a job, or you can work as a motion picture executive and humiliate yourself as a career! ""  - Peter Dragon

""Is that the gun I gave you for Hanukkah?"" Illena Douglas as Wendy Ward

2470071,4,B000CQQI8K,"Although the series starring Jay Mohr was short-lived, it was packed with non-stop funny. Illeana Douglas was terrific as a bright, witty call girl-turned production executive.

2470072,5,B000CQQI8K,"In the first minute of ""Action"", producer Peter Dragon dresses down a caterer with a series of F-bombs.  The caterer's crime?  He told Peter Dragon that he was in his parking spot.
Jay Mohr was born to play the part of Peter, a producer whose latest action film has just become a complete flop.  Now Peter needs to make a hit film, and fast, so that he can regain all of the perks of being a hot Hollywood producer.  Along the way he will hire a prostitute as his assistant director, court financing from questionable foreign sources, and give his all to a newly 'out' leading man.  There is no lie big enough for Peter Dragon, and we get to watch him discard any principles that he might have had in order to make his film.

Action is simply one of the most biting satires of Hollywood that I've ever seen.  It includes cameos of actors playing themselves, but only a couple degrees exaggerated from real life.

Although the later episodes lag, I'm convinced that Action was removed from the air because it hit some nerves in Hollywood.  This stuff had to be drawn from someone's real life experiences.  Its too funny to simply have been made up.",1208822400,2,1147,4.471153846153846
2470073,5,B000CQQI8K,"I worked on this show when it was in post-production and in ""dailies telecine"" every night we would talk about the funniest line from that day's shooting and how that line would never make it to broadcast!

Well, many of those lines didn't make it to broadcast, they were bleeped out... but they're back and all of them are every bit as funny as they were the nights I first heard them.

I can also remember that we kept working on the show even after it was canceled and at the time it seemed strange to me that we were finishing episodes that would never be broadcast. I'm glad to see them included here so that everyone who is a fan of this show can see them all.

It's incredible how ""inside"" the show is. By far and away, it is the most no-holds-barred look at the industry I have seen or heard of.

But one of my favorite things about the way the show is constructed is in the use of inside snippets for all the bumpers to commercial. The use of ""stix"" (the marker board that syncs sound to picture at the beginning of each take) or the insertion of a theatre snack bar placard are true genius as a device to move us from content to commercial.

2470074,5,B000CQQI8K,"No way could this thing ever stand on it's own with the reality shows and other mindless programing. America is not ready to actually come home from work and think in front of the TV (not that this was PBS material)...the point is...making references to other things is actually work for many people (the part of making their mind do something...like see the connection of the joke) I am way tired of the water cooler chat about American Idol, Survivor, etc... I can't deal with the lack imagination that surrounds the majors (TV)

If the series were premiered today it would stand a far better chance of surviving - UGLY BETTY, which is similar in many ways, is a strong testament to that.

2470079,5,B000CQQI8K,"""Wendy, how many times do I have to tell you not to call me Rene when I'm trying to intimidate the white man?"" The short-lived, foul-mouthed Joel Silver-produced Action is a wondrously vicious satire of Hollywood producers like - well, Joel Silver for a start. Jay Mohr's Peter Dragon is coming off massive flop Slow Torture and trying to bounce back with an increasingly dubious script called Beverly Hills Gun Club he bought by accident (""The script I wanted was by Alan Rifkin, you got me a script by Adam Rafkin. You're telling me we paid quarter of a million dollars to the wrong Jew?""). Along the way he has to raise finance from some very dubious characters (cue Beverly Hills Gun Club baseball caps and, for Hassidic backers, prayer shawls and yarmulkes), try (and fail) to outmanoeuvre a vindictive studio chief, lure his teenage star out of rehab, put his overweight leading lady through painful liposuction from a quack doctor, sleep with his leading man to first keep him on a picture and then persuade him to drop out without being paid, lure macho director Titus Scroad out of retirement (R. Lee Ermey's finest hour, channelling Warren Oates playing Peckinpah), deal with product placement agents (""You're asking me to sell cancer to children - for less than $3 million?"") and try to dispel rumors that he likes putting frogs up his rectum before he can even start shooting in a town where even Rabbis at funerals are pitching scripts (""Barbra Streisand is interested."" ""Starring or directing?"" ""Directing."" ""Get outta here!"").

Intended as a replacement for The Larry Sanders Show on HBO but picked up by the Fox Network instead, with a pilot episode that sees Keanu Reeves getting a handjob from a whore during a premiere, a leading lady who's a hooker whose last boyfriend was when she was 13 (""Let's just say I spent a lot of time on the set of Chinatown."") and with a script boasting some of the foulest language ever bleeped out for primetime (but restored to its full profane glory for DVD) and characters with names like The Blood and Piss Guy, it's amazing that it even lasted as long as the 11 out of 13 episodes that were broadcast. Filled with quotable dialog and killer injokes, it does start to lose steam in the final episodes, implying that this would have burned itself out anyway, but when it works it's magnificent. And a special nod to Lee Arenberg as the creepy and terrifying diminutive gay studio chief Bobby G - imagine a short and malignant Bruce Willis on a particularly bad day and you're still not even close!

Columbia's DVD contains all 13 episodes, a good retrospective documentary charting the shows slow death and three audio commentaries that are surprisingly unguarded, especially when dropping titbits like Illeana Douglas' increasing unhappiness about playing a hooker despite signing on to play... a hooker!",1168732800,2,2859,4.844580777096114

2470083,5,B000CQQI8K,"This send-up of Hollywood makes Altman's Hollywood satire THE PLAYER look like it was shot under water by actors on valium. The pun-intendted title suits this series well. It is jammed with clever plot-twists and stellar talent (principals Jay Mohr as the Darwinian narcissist producer Peter Dragon; Ileana Doublas as the ultimate Hollywood insider, a professional sex worker whom Dragon makes his assistant producer because of her faultless nose for good--and bad--scripts; Jarrad Paul as the neurotic TV writer who hopes to make it in the big-budget action genre with his script for ""Beverly Hills Gun Club""; Jack Plotnick as the ambitious but massochistic, dry-cleaning-fetching gay executive producer; and Buddy Hackett as Dragon's nap-susceptible body guard and chauffeur who just also happens to be his uncle). Add to this a number of cameos from the likes of Keanu Reeves, David Hasselhoff, Scott Wolf, Salma Hayeck, Sandra Bulluck, and ""that Joe Isuzu guy"" (David Leisure playing an out-of-work version of himself serving as security guard/gate-lifter at the studio lot).

Originally produced for Fox TV, the series takes a jab at everyone remotely connected to ""the business."" As rude, politically indifferent, and self-serving as Peter Dragon is, you soon come ""to feel his pain"" when you see the number of spoiled brats, self-promoters, and losers he is asked to manage and/or navigate among in the course of any given day. (When he seeks spiritual counsel from a rabbi at a funeral, the rabbi is quick to offer him a script to read. ""Streisand is very interested,"" the rabbi assures him. Dragon takes the script, asking, ""Starring or direting?"" When the rabbi answers ""Directing,"" Dragon tosses the script in a nearby trashcan. Mohr's expression? Priceless!)

The writing for the (unlucky?) 13 espisodes is consistently top-notch. The fun never lags. It is as if everyone involved knew Fox would not give them a second season and they had to pack everything into the first. (Everything beyond episode 6 was new to me, so I suspect Fox never even broadcast everything they had.) Although we don't ever get to see the premier of ""Beverly Hills Gun Club,"" or the predictable Oscar snub, the story arc is satisfyingly complete at the end of episode 13 when the legal rights to the threatened script are secured and Douglas's character returns to her more honorable previous profession.

I'm so glad the makers of this show believed in it enough to put it out on DVD--and with a ""making of"" featurette and filmmaker commentaries for several episodes. This is satire at its most outrageous--directed at such a worthy target.",1158969600,3,2630,5.111627906976744

2470087,5,B000CQQI8K,"This was one that I had heard about but never saw when it was on TV.  I finally bought it and became instantly hooked!  I guess what I like most about it is the fact that it mirrors at least some of what I've experienced as an actor.

The series was too short, in my opinon.  Way too short.  But considering it was meant for HBO and was picked up by Fox (I believe), I understand why it only aired one season.  Had it been on HBO, it might have survived two or three seasons.  I know from the commentary on the DVD that the original plan was to actually make the movie that they were ""making"" in the series.

The whole thing plays out in one season (one DVD) and the ""punch line"" is in the last episode with the conversation between Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr) and Wendy Ward (Illeana Douglas).  It is just too true!

If you're an actor, or involved in any way with Hollywood, or if you just enjoy watching a series about Hollywood, or if you're a couch potato looking for something that will give you another excuse to sit on the couch and laugh your rear off, then this DVD is for you.

2470088,5,B000CQQI8K,"More than 5 years after its short-lived run on Fox, ""Action"" has come to DVD! I never liked American sitcoms. Never found them funny. Can't stand laugh tracks. But this raunchy no-holds-barred showbiz satire had me hooked on the first episode. ""Action"" was the funniest thing I had ever seen. I rearranged my schedule to watch this show in 1999. And it doesn't have a laugh track! It doesn't need one. It's actually funny. ""Action"" was cancelled after only eight episodes. Fox had put it up against ""Frasier"", ""Chicago Hope"" and WWF (now WWE) wrestling on Thursday nights. The stiffest competition on television. ""Action"" apparently did ok in urban markets but no where else. That's not surprising, since half of its audience was watching the WWF. Now all 13 episodes, including some never shown on network television, are on these 2 DVDs. The order of the episodes is different than it was on television, and it's not clear to me what the intended order was. Expletives that were bleeped out on television have been restored, although they were funnier when they were bleeped, truthfully. The ""beep""s became part of the joke.

""Action"" follows the outrageous antics of Hollywood producer Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr) as he tries to produce ""Beverly Hills Gun Club"", his latest action-comedy and hopeful hit. Peter's production company Dragonfire Films specializes in ""event films"", meaning ultra-violent action, and Peter needs to redeem himself after an expensive flop. Peter's boss at the studio is domineering, gay billionaire Bobby G (Lee Arenberg) -who is married to Peter's ex-wife Jane (Cindy Ambuehl). His Vice President of Production is blunt, savvy Wendy Ward (Illeana Douglas), a former child-star-turned-high-priced-hooker. Stuart Glazer (Jack Plotnick) is his much-abused Head of Production. Peter's driver and security man is his Uncle Lonnie (Buddy Hackett). His leading man (Fabrizio Filippo) is a junkie. But Peter will stop at nothing to make his movie -in a culture that is socially deterministic, to put it mildly. Exhausted, put-upon screenwriter Adam Rafkin (Jarrad Paul) is caught in the middle of it all.

""Action"" has been called the ""filthiest"" and ""meanest"" television show ever, but I never thought of it that way. I just think it's hilariously blunt. It's not dirty for dirty's sake; it's dirty for funny's sake. In spite of their faults, these are characters that people in the audience would want to know in real life. They talk the way people really talk and think like people really think. And they enjoy it. For all of it's cynicism and lewdness, ""Action"" might be the least neurotic sitcom in recent decades. The characters have a certain joie de vivre that is infectious. That was a big part of the show's appeal for me. The writing is so economical that there is no filler. It's non-stop smart comedy. I found myself convinced of the writers' brilliance while watching an episode that revolves around a frog-up-the-butt joke. Now, I don't like scatological humor. But I couldn't stop laughing. Anybody who can make a crude anal joke funny for a half an hour is a genius. Warren Zevon was the perfect choice to write and perform the theme song. (Too bad his first proposal was rejected by the network.) There are cameos by Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Salma Hayek, Scott Wolf, Tony Hawk, David Leisure, and David Hasselhoff. Jay Mohr plays Peter Dragon to sharp, hilarious perfection. Jack Plotnick performs to near-equal brilliance as Peter's used and abused lackey. These guys have a surprising ability to evoke real emotions in the midst of an orgy of brutal satire and dirty jokes.

When I first saw ""Action"", I thought that the blunt, horny producer of over-the-top action films might have been inspired by notorious producer Don Simpson. But apparently the incidents in the series were based on stories that producer Joel Silver told the writers as well as on the experiences of the writers themselves. I've heard a lot of speculation on why ""Action"" had so little audience, even though the writing is among the best ever on television. Some say the show was ""too hip for the room"", too ""insider"", or ""too edgy"". I don't buy that. ""Action"" is jam-packed with insider jokes. So is ""The Producers"". But the behavior in is so hilarious that the audience doesn't need to get all the jokes. I think the problem was simply the time slot. The perfect spot for ""Action"" would have been Monday nights after ""That 70s Show"", the spot that ""Titus"" -which has a similar audience- succeeded in as a mid-season replacement.  On Thursday nights, half of ""Action""'s audience was watching the WWF, a well-established show that never has re-runs. It's disappointing and a little puzzling that Fox was not willing to move the show to save it at least for one season. There is very little I wouldn't have given to see ""Beverly Hills Gun Club"" through to its premiere.

The DVDs (Sony Pictures 2006): All episodes are about 23 minutes long. Disc 1 contains episodes 1-8 and an audio commentary for Episode 8 (""Love Sucks""). The audio commentary is by writers Jim Vallely, Matt Silverstein, Dave Jesser, producer/sometime director Don Reo, actor Jarrad Paul, and writer/co-executive producer Ron Zimmerman. Unfortunately, there isn't much information offered. It's clear that these guys think the show's jokes still hold up, but I'd rather have had more commentary and less chuckling. We know it's funny. Tell us something we don't know. Disc 2 includes episodes 9-13 and more bonus features: audio commentaries of the ""Dead Man Floating"" and ""One Easy Piece"" episodes, featuring the same group of writers and producers, plus writer/story editor Will Forte. ""Getting Into the Action"" (26 min) is the bonus feature you really want to watch. It examines the life cycle of ""Action"", from genesis to cancellation, through interviews with executive producers Joel Silver and Chris Thompson, producer Don Reo,  the writers, and Jay Mohr. ""Trust Me: Useful Words and Phrases"" presents about a dozen movie industry terms with accompanying clips from ""Action"" either illustrating or spoofing them.

The failure for the same people to pull their heads out of the sand and get with the realities of today and simply have a laugh lead to the twisted type of logic that has our citiizens more worried about when Brad & Angelina are going to get married than the hundreds of billions of those same citizen's tax dollars being spent on bombing tens of thousands of men, women, and children into oblivion in a country that less than one percent of these same citizens will ever have any contact with let alone point to on a map.

The role of Peter Dragon is the perfect part for Jay Mohr (even better than his role in Jerry Maguire) and the story of him trying his best to keep the movie from hell on schedule and on budget just keeps getting better and better with each episode.  It's really too bad that they cancelled the show so soon.  I would have loved to have seen the production continue until the fictional movie was finally complete.  I bet it would have been 10 times better than watching the Project Greenlight reality series.

The reason I took off a star is because the DVD is just so poorly done.  The only difference between the DVD set and the video recordings I have of the show is that the DVD doesn't bleep any of the foul language, there are no commercials, and there are no promos for other TV shows along the bottom of the screen occasionally.

They didn't even take the time to remove the ""This show is intended for mature audiences"" warning that's shown at the start of the show and at almost all of the commercial breaks.  I imagine that it would have been easy to cut those out.  Also, the ""speical features"" on the DVD are not worth watching at all.

It would have been great if they had released this DVD with two audio tracks; the original Fox version with all the bleeps and the uncensored one, as was originally rumored but that's not the case. The special features also leave a lot to be desired as well.

However, due to the fact that this is one of the greatest shows of all time, I'm just glad Fox, Columbia-Tristar, and Silver productions got off their greedy asses and released this on DVD. Ironic that even though it was a great show and people wanted more of it that it came down to a money issue between three greedy, bickering studios as to whether or not it should be released.

I was hooked on this show about 60 seconds into the very first episode. Any show that chooses a Warren Zevon song as its theme immediately gets my attention.

Jay Mohr is as perfect a comic actor as our generation has to offer and his portrayal of the aptly named Peter Dragon is Mohr at his best. Jarrad Paul as hapless screenwriter Adam Rafkin, he of the Lubiderm Lane address, comes in a close second to Mohr. The rest of the supporting cast, as well as the guest stars which include a continuous stream of cameos by well known Hollywood denizens, are uniformly outstanding. In all they represent the shallowest, most self-centered, and ultimately most hysterical, collection of characters this side of Seinfeld. The dialogue is fast and furious, with no shortage of cynicism, in its riotous presentation of Tinseltown behind the scenes. Even 'Action' executive producer Joel Silver himself cannot escape being lampooned within his own show.

The only caveat is that this show is about as blue as network television could possibly get, even with all of the bleeps (which have been removed for the DVD). At the time, it was barely a half-step short of cable in its raunchiness and mature subject matter, so if you're the sensitive type, you've been warned.
