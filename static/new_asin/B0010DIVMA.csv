There was a risk that it would no longer make a great impression on me, after all these years and the hundreds of movies I've seen in that time, but I decided to go for it. It was a good choice, because this is a gem - the script is excellent and never stops surprising you with how the situation develops. I can see this working well as a stage play too - it relies on the acting and the smart script more than anything else. Fernandel and Toto are both fantastic. The original soundtrack is in Italian, but Fernandel actually speaks a mix of Italian and French that is funny in itself. The print is very good quality and the sound is clear as well - the only drawback is that the disc may not be encoded for your region, but don't let that stop you from seeing this classic comedy.

PS: If you are in Region 1 and are looking for a good multi-region player to play this disc, I've been very happy with this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-DVP3690K-Ultra-DVD-Player/dp/B00B8TOFSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips DVP3690K Ultra DVD Player</a>.",1458259200,,1170,4.85

I saw ""The Law is the Law"" when it was playing in the theaters in Europe long time ago. I remember laughing so hard, my sides were hurting. Even discounting the impressibility of youth, that still is one very funny film.
The twists of the plot and the superior performances make this a timeless film, that would be just as enjoyable today. I remember Fernandel was the greatest French comedy actor at that time, and Dinan was not too far behind. Just remembering their faces brings a smile to my face.
I am surprised that the film has not been released for USA viewers. I am sure that if an enterprising person watches the film, the potential will become obvious.",1247184000,4,817,4.5646258503401365
