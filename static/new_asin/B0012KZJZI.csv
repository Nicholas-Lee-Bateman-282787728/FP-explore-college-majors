8246621,5,B0012KZJZI,I am not a woodworker but this was totally fascinating to watch.  Graham Blackburn should have his own television show!  Would be a great pairing with Antiques Roadshow.  So much information that you can use just looking around your own house.,1325462400,,243,4.878048780487805
8246622,5,B0012KZJZI,Great fun and highly informative. I loved the piece on spindlemaking - I'd never seen a froe or an spokeshave before and now I feel like an expert. Bravo!,1220227200,,154,4.344827586206897
