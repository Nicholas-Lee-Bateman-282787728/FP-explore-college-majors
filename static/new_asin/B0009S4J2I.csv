2316706,5,B0009S4J2I,"This great collection of classic Pink Panther Cartoons will feature 5 discs.  The single disc releases will only be the first 3 discs from this set.  However, if you only like the better earliest cartoons from this series, then you may want to consider that option.

These cartoons were produced in 3 waves:

1964 to 1969 - 62 classic cartoons were produced at this time for theaters.  These are the best of the batch and truly creative, some winning awards.  In 1969 the Pink Panther was retired and sold to Television with The Inspector for a half-hour Saturday Morning show on NBC. (Remember that classic Pink Panther car shown in the opening titles?)

1971 to 1977 - 30 more cartoons were produced for theaters, bringing the Pink Panther out of theatrical retirement.  These were a little more hit & miss that the first wave of cartoons.  Still being produced for theaters, they had more time & money to produce these than the next wave.  The same first wave directors worked on this wave. These also got sprinkled into the Saturday Morning TV show after their theatrical run.

1978 to 1980 - 32 cartoons were produced for the 1978 Pink Panther TV show on a limited budget & short time period.  New directors were brought in to assist the original directors with the increased one year work load. The drop in quality shows on these shorts, you feel like you are watching a Saturday Morning cartoon. These quickly made, low budget cartoons were then re-packaged to theaters over three years.

Non of these cartoons were ever shot widescreen, so it is good that this DVD will be presented full frame.

Some improvements over the previous ""Jet Pink"" DVD cartoon collection:
All 1960's cartoons have improved fidelity soundtracks.
PINK PHINK has the original theme song restored on the end credits.
JET PINK has vast picture & sound improvements & original titles are restored.
IN THE PINK OF THE NIGHT has the correct colors in the opening titles.

Some bad notes:
1) A sampling of some of my favorite cartoons revealed some to have the TV laugh track: PINK BLUEPRINT, PSYCHEDELIC PINK, PINK TUBA-DORE. There are probably more. The DVD capabilities should have allowed us to watch each cartoon with either soundtrack as an option!  Also a 'music only' sound track would have been nice.

2) You will need Jerry Beck's ""Pink Panther Ultimate Guide to the Coolest Cat In Town"" book (sold here on Amazon.com) to guide you through the cartoons you want to watch. The title list on this DVD with the generic ""Pink ...."" titles that these cartoons have will not help you find that 'toon you want to watch.

3) The storage case is poorly designed, disc 2 rests on top of disc 3 & disc 4 rests on top of disc 5.  If you want to view Discs 3 or 5, you have to take the top disc off first (find a safe non scratching place to put it) and then remove the disc you want to watch.  Then replace the above disc so that it doesn't get damaged.
You may want to invest in some extra cases to save the discs from future damage.

HINT: PLACE DISCS 4 & 5 UNDER DISCS 2 & 3, they have the later 1970's cartoons that you will probably not watch much.  This way they are out of the way.",1121558400,425,3163,4.521968365553603

2316756,5,B0009S4J2I,"All 124 shorts of the Pink Panther from 1964 to 1980 are together in this whomping 5-disc DVD collection from MGM! His original 3 primetime specials are on a separate DVD by Fox, as a recent one, A Very Pink Christmas, has never been on DVD as of 2016. At any rate, these shorts are among the most famous creations of DePatie-Freleng Enterprises; world-famous in fact, due to the Pink Panther being a mostly silent character like Tom and Jerry! He would have a bunch of affiliates, too, in a similar manner to the Looney Tunes, such as the Ant and the Aardvark, The Inspector, CrazyLegs Crane and others, now on DVD & Blu-ray by Kino Lorber! You never know what this famous pink kitty will face next; this collection has a ton of bonus features and his 32 shorts originally made for TV (alongside CrazyLegs Crane) that also got released in theatres! Unlike the guff with Kino Lorber with his affiliates' shorts, all 124 Pink Panther shorts (and 3 original TV specials) are in their original Fullscreen format on DVD with this collection (and A Pink Christmas' own DVD). It's no wonder this famous pink kitty is a spokesman for insulation and breast cancer for so many years; his very first short, The Pink Phink, won an Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1964! His only other Oscar nominated short was 1966's The Pink Blueprint. Many of the shorts contain laugh tracks, like TV cartoons of their era, as if they were filmed before a live audience, but most of them have none, though all of them have been remastered for this release. You won't be sorry with this pink monster of a collection!",1462838400,10,1590,4.582456140350877

2316798,5,B0009S4J2I,"Calling it a classic, finally truth in advertising! With Depatie Freleng (Bugs Bunny), Mel Blanc & of course, the pink panther, larger than life, this cartoon is comparable to The Flintstones, Jetsons, Bugs Bunny as shear genius which forever hold it's own in the generations that follow! I give Henry Mancinni kudos for the musical scores...although Ant & Arkvark as well as The Inspector are separately available, get them also! The Pink Panther Cartoon Collection comes in cased in a sturdy plastic package with all the cartoons, you won't be disappointed! As silent and as funny as Charlie Chaplin! And reasonably priced! Pink Power, forever!",1457740800,5,646,5.161904761904762
2316799,5,B0009S4J2I,"I  like  the  pink  panther,  he  deals  with  his  own  problems  but  ends  up  in  very  odd  situations.  The  inspector  with  his  spyglass  &  his  uniform  in  blue  sidekick  are  funny  too,
&  then  you  got  the  ant  &  the  aardvark,  which  I've  heard  are  not  involved  in  this  DVD  pack.  He  tries  this  or  that,  but  unlike  the  coyote  from  Looney  toons  whose  always  trying  to  catch  the  roadrunner  the  aardvark  fails.  &  tells  us  the  viewers  how  he  feels  about  his  bad  luck  with  his  situation  after  his  failure. Good  comments  in  my  opinion!

The  pink  panther  has  a  desire  to  have  things  in  pink,  so  he  goes  around  tormenting  someone  who  looks  like  the  inspector  with  the  spyglass,  except  its  not  him.  This  guy  doesn't  stand  anymore  then  3  ft.  tall.  Like  a  little  midget,  &  gets  frustrated  after  a  while  &  talks  gibberish.
Its  a  real  laugh  as  the  pink  panther  tries  getting  his  situation  under  control  whatever  it  is,  but  he  seems  to  never  be  able  to  escape  his  odd  like  problems.
These  shows  have  never  failed  to  please  me.  I'd  watch  Pink Panther  any  day.",1455408000,,1208,4.361256544502618

2316901,4,B0009S4J2I,"THE PINK PANTHER CLASSIC CARTOON COLLECTION: DEPATIE-FRELENG's most popular creation, the long running PINK PANTHER cartoon series evolved from their inventive title sequences in a string of classic PETER SELLERS flicks, with HENRY MANCINI's irresistible jazzy theme blessedly intact. A well meaning but trouble prone cool cat, the mute main character (more recently known for hawking pink fiberglass insulation) engaged in simple, semi-surreal Chaplin-esque adventures, with ideas occasionally recycled from WARNER BROTHERS director FRELENG's previous TWEETY & SYLVESTER and YOSEMITE SAM toons. Sidekick episodes (unfortunately not included in this otherwise stellar set) included SELLERS' bumbling gumshoe CLOSEAU resurrected as THE INSPECTOR (voice of PAT HARRINGTON) and THE ANT & THE AARDVARK, a DEAN MARTIN meets JACKIE MASON pair of ROAD RUNNER/WILE E. COYOTE type adversaries (voiced by JOHN BYNER). Colorful, stylishly animated and cleverly hip, THE PINK PANTHER was a rose colored delight that stood out among the cookie cutter HANNA-BARBERA and FILMATION productions that dominated Saturday morning TV in the sixties and seventies.

2316902,5,B0009S4J2I,"I bought this for my son's 6th birthday.  The dirty little truth is that I loved these cartoons from when I was a kid many years ago.  We've had hours of laughs watching this together.  Based on the reactions of my 3 and 6 year old kids, I can confidently say that these old cartoons are still relevant in this modern age of computer animation.  We'll often whistle that cool Mancini jazz when we're not watching it too.",1386201600,3,420,4.346153846153846
2316903,4,B0009S4J2I,"""That`s one cool cat man!"" :-) To quote a phrase from the 60s. Well I remember I liked this better way back when I first saw the Pink Panther. And I know that it`s just me and that this cartoon is the cats meow. And it`s still good but not like I remember. But I mean it is pretty ingenious to have a cartoon character that doesn't ever say a thing, for the most part and still able to communicate his intension's. In some way`s it`s reminiscent of the cool quiet kids in school. Only the Pink Panther, in the cartoon is many times more of a buffoon than cool which makes it funny. Some of the cartoons are dated from the 60s Or at least one I saw.

Also to note this cartoon also won an academy award. When it first came out it was like nothing else.

Great cartoon overall.",1383696000,,775,4.092105263157895

All of theese cartoons are fantastic right up to the end. Hes particularly funny when hes annoying the man with the mustchdach like in the first one which won a grammy The Pink Phink  and when The Pink Panther tries to get him to paint his house pink and yet the guy would rather have the house painted blue. Another one is Rock-a-Bye Pinky where The Pink Panther tries to get rid of the guy while hes camping with his dog so he can get a good nights sleep because hes snoring. This guys loyal dog gets the blame for everything The Pink Panther does. Every single one of the other ones are just as good and theres 124 total so if those two are that good just think how good all the others are.  You should get them.

This is the entire collection of the original series of cartoons (not the newer, inferior version on cable TV today). Most have no words, just the familiar captivating theme song written by Henry Mancini playing throughout each 6 or 7 minute clip. The kids' eyes remain glued to the action. It's silly, but it's fun.

Arranged in chronological order from first to last, this collection uses 5 separate discs to present each story. The early episodes are the best, so don't be surprised if you wear out the first couple of discs. I'll admit that I still take a moment to watch the action and remember when I saw them new as a child. It's something that the whole family can enjoy.

Want to have him or her watch some commercial-less television without violent heros who obviously abuse steroids or silly, mindless Barbie fairies? Or even the boringly PC cartoons on PBS or Nick Junior?

In addition, better the Pink Panther theme as an earworm than Rescue Pets'.

Did I say the children love them? And they are inexpensive?",1359936000,,475,4.925

I have loved these cartoons since I was a kid, and was very happy to find our children appreciate and enjoy these classic Pink Panther cartoons as well.

You get 13 hours, 17 minutes of Pink Panther goodness, with several cool special features. In addition to the 124 cartoons, there are two (of the seven) special features, ""Think Pink: How to Draw the Pink Panther"" and ""Page to Screen: In the Pink & Pink Blueprint"" that have been of special interest to our artistically inclined daughters. We have all enjoyed watching this 5 DVD set as a family, and have been very pleased with this purchase.

2316993,1,B0009S4J2I,I bought this as a replacement for the complete set I lost in the past and this one isn't the best quality as you cannot easily navigate the main menu episode selections;  it's like hit the play all or fast forward to each episode.  I played the discs on 3 different players and it must be the formatting on this particular set that you cannot access an individual episode with ease ( or maybe the set I bought is faulty )  The picture quality looks faded and the bonus materials are less than exciting.  I was a huge Pink Panther fan as a kid but this particular 5 disc set is cheaply packaged and bad quality.  I think I can find a better boxed set than this one.  2 thumbs down,1333497600,,680,4.152671755725191

2317021,5,B0009S4J2I,"I must admit before anything else that I was surprised by the length and detail of the other reviews. I never realized that there are some really die hard Pink Panther fans who knew so much about him!

The only reason I got this set was because I HATE the new Pink Panther episodes where there is lot more talking and the graphics are too streamlined for my taste! I like the old stuff... less talk more laughter!!!
I got this set, as with many other different sets, for my daughter because I want her to enjoy the stuff we did growing up and less of the idiotic stuff that passes for cartoons these days... like Cow & Chicken... what is that about? Naked butts being flashed all the time on kids cartoon! What's going on here!?

I'm really happy to say that she has fallen in love with the Pink Panther and she already knows some of the episodes and has chosen some favourites... she keeps asking me to play one of the DVD's whenever possible... I think because there is little dialogue, she can easily follow the plot and she can appreciate the humour! Even I found myself laughing at some of the episodes that have been stored away in the back of my mind... its as if I was having childhood flashbacks!

A great set worth the money for both the grownups who used to watch Pink Panther as kids and for the new generations!

*note: never realized there were so many drunks appearing in several episodes... plus it is a bit of an issue seeing him smoke with that cigarette holder... need to be careful with that one around the kids!",1315699200,,1532,4.364912280701755

2317023,4,B0009S4J2I,"Pretty nice box, the only downside is that discs 2 and 4 go over 3 and 5 so if you want to watch disc 3 or 5 you have to remove the others first.
It comes with a little booklet with information and list of content of every disc.

I do dislike the antipiracy short film at the beggining of all of the 5 discs, would be nice to be able to skip it at least, after all I did pay for the DVD, but I guess is something that almost every DVD suffers...

Menus are nice and pretty straight forward. Shorts are nicely sorted, you can play all or choose the one you want to play. The extras in disc 5 are pretty cool, the only thing I have to say is that at the end of every movie introduction film in the extras appears a sort of commercial saying that the movies are available for purchase on DVD. It's ok to have it on the booklet but I think there's no need to put it in the discs, kind of annoying. Also, some of them are missing, the one from the movie not owned by MGM, obviously, but also, the ones from Curse Of The Pink Panther and Son Of The Pink Panther.

Despite the little issues it's a pretty nice boxset and do note there's no complain on the shorts, the major reason you'd purchase it.",1305676800,,1192,3.9790794979079496

The six year old watches them ALL THE TIME.  Now, the two year old is beginning to love it as well.  Its crazy, I had no idea they would love it so much.  It has been well worth the money.",1302393600,,327,3.75
2317035,5,B0009S4J2I,"As a big fan of classic cartoons, I always find myself fully immersed in episodes starring Donald Duck, Goofy, Daffy Duck, Garfield, Ducktales, Tom and Jerry, and characters. The Pink Panther is one of those cartoons that remains high on my list, right beside Donald Duck and Goofy. The Pink Panther is very unique in which, like Tom and Jerry, that is hardly any dialogue in most episodes (""Sink Pink"" and ""Pink Ice"" feature Rich Little providing the voice). The panther himself doesn't need to speak, anyway, because his silent personalty speaks for itself. He is already sly, creative, and sometimes suave. The cartoon style is typical 60's and 70's, yet it's also wonderful to look at. The cartoonish slapstick is equal to that of Goofy and Daffy Duck. The famous theme by Henry Mancini is unbeatable.

Now, the reason why I'm not giving a perfect 10 out of 10 is because some pieces of music (except the main theme) repeat in almost every episode (ranging from Pink Ice to Spark Plug Pink), and I found the repetition to be slightly tiresome. But still, this is one of the superior cartoons to have ever been created. The DVD collection is highly recommendable.

2317037,5,B0009S4J2I,"I loved Pink Panther as a kid & was happy when my 2 yr old grandson shared my interest in watching the old shows on cable.  Of course they aren't always on at just the right time or day for us, so that prompted me to look for a dvd so we could watch them whenever(& wherever) we wanted.
I shopped around quite a bit before deciding on this one & we are both very happy with my choice.  It has a lot of the old cartoons I remember. I feel it is somewhat educational for us also to watch together, esp since there is very little to basically, NO talking in these shows.  SO, we do the talking & I ask my grandson ""what is Pink Panther doing?"" or ""what's happening now?"" or ""How many flowers is he planting?"" ""what color is he painting the house?"" etc.
The interpretations/answers he gives are often times amazing!! Sometimes he asks me about what's going on & I try my best to explain. On a downside-alas, there is some ""violence"" on a few of the cartoons-like guns or a robber trying to break in a safe or the guy that comes home & has had too much to drink & finds PP in his bed!!

It was a very pleasant surprise and this collection has become an instant hit with my children (how could it not). They especially enjoy the Ant & Ardvark cartoons.

2317058,4,B0009S4J2I,"Obviously the Pink Panther cartoons blow just about any newer cartoons out of the water in terms of creativity and humor.  Personally, I enjoy the old-school animation, and believe that you do not need cutting edge, computer generated graphics to make a great cartoon.  MOST of the cartoons represented here are clever and timeless in my opinion.

The collection is great, it includes everything, although maybe too much.  I also enjoy the slap-stick humor and shenanigans, mixed nicely with some dry humor as well.  The problem for me is that I find that only about 2/3 or so of the episodes are really, really funny...some are just boring and pointless.

This set would be perfect if they cut out about a third or so of the Pink Panther episodes and left out some of the more boring ones, and also I could do without the Ant and the Aarvark and Roland and Ratfink.  The Inspector, however, is absolute gold...it is very clever, and had me about rolling on the floor laughing at times, as well as the majority of Pink's cartoons.

Overall this set brought back alot of great memories, but again, it could have been cut down a bit instead of forcing you to buy all the filler.  Not quite worthy of 5 stars, but a solid 4...I would say about 75% of the material is 5-star, but the other 25% is lacking enough to drag the overall rating down a star, mainly just because I don't like paying for the filler.  You may be better off buying the DVDs included in this set seperately, choosing only the ones that interest you the most, although this may prove to be more expensive.  The two Inspector discs as well as the later Pink Panther episodes are my personal favorites, because these are the ones I remember most from my childhood.",1250726400,4,1729,4.54516129032258

Sadly, the set loses 1-star, because of the bad product quality control. 1) Although sealed in cellophane, discs in my set arrived with adhesive on the playing side of the discs. 2) The cover for Volume 2, has the spine labelled incorrectly as ""Pranks In The Pink"" instead of ""Adventures In The Pink"". 3) None of the slimline DVD cases are identical. All are different in terms of the way they open, the manufacturer, and the type of spindle the discs are held on! 4) Lastly, the cardboard outer sleeve is fractionally too big to hold the discs snug, and thus is likely to get squashed during transit!

For such a great set, it's a shame that MGM's DVD Quality Control has been so awful with this particular release. I have contacted them about this, and eagerly await their response!",1235606400,2,933,4.580838323353293

Volumes 5 and 6 were only released separately under the title of ""The Pink Panther and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection"" on April 3, 2007 and March 4, 2008 respectively. Also available on the 18-disc Pink Panther Ultimate Collection.

[Note: while Vol. 5 contains the complete series of The Ant & the Aardvark, Vol. 6 contains only the first 17 (of 34) Inspector shorts, hence the second volume.]

Volumes 7-9 were only released on the 18-disc Pink Panther Ultimate Collection and are expected [by fans who already own the preceding volumes] to be released individually sometime soon as separate volumes.

Bottom line: A solid cartoon collection. Recommended if you don't already own the previous separate releases or the 5-disc collector's set or the 18-disc ultimate collection. For fans that only own the previous separate volumes and/or the 5-disc set, I recommend waiting for the individual releases of Volumes 7 and 8. Volume 9, btw, contains the remaining Pink Panther shorts and extras from the 5-disc set [and later 18-disc set] not previously released separately.",1232841600,86,3141,7.833802816901408

2317091,5,B0009S4J2I,Its e very good compilation of pink panter. My daughter of 4 and I enjoys it very much. I would recomended hightly,1222732800,,114,4.2272727272727275
2317092,5,B0009S4J2I,Very cool.  My kids all love this.  I wasn't even a huge fan when i was a kid but i've really enjoyed watching them with them.  This was definitely worth the money paid for it.,1222732800,,176,3.9714285714285715
2317093,5,B0009S4J2I,"The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection collects all of the Pink Panther cartoons that were made between 1964 and 1978 (but released to theaters between 1964 and 1980).
The Pink Panther cartoon character was initially designed as an intro tag to the Peter Sellers movie of the same name about a diamond which quite frankly was boring IMHO. Each film was literally upstaged by Friz Freleng's classic animated sequences featuring literally a panther that was colored pink.
The first Pink Panther cartoon in its own right was Pink Phink and it is a classic as he kept facing his nemesis, the Big Nose Man, by painting the man's house pink instead of blue.
I used to watch these cartoons religiously as a kid and I still love them today.
On this 5 DVD set you get every theatrical cartoon made like The Pink Phink, Bully For Pink (one of my favorites where the cat is a bullfighter), Congratulations It's Pink, G.I. Pink, Pink Valiant, Pink Pranks, Pink Blue Plate, The Pink Flea and many many more plus the shorts made for Saturday morning TV in 1978/79 like Pink Quackers, Pink in the Woods, Pink Arcade and Pink Breakfast amongst many more.
I notice that some of the 1978 remakes with new music soundtracks and newly added scenes which were Yankee Doodle Pink (originally Pinky Doodle with a new ending), Pet Pink Pebbles (it's Rocky Pink with new score and scene where rock goes around the town like a pinball) and Pink of Baghdad (originally Pink of Arabee with new score and added scene) aren't listed but were good shorts in their own right. I actally preferred Pet Pink Pebbles' music score and the newly added pinball sequence where the rock bounces through town to Rocky Pink although some complain.
Many people gripe that other shorts like The Ant and the Aardvark (voiced by John Byner who did dead on impersonations of Dean Martin and Jackie Mason and had 17 cartoons), The Inspector (based on Inspector Clouseau but funnier and had 34 cartoons), The Tijuana Toads (the two Mexican frogs Pancho and Toro whom had 17 cartoons) and Misterjaw (the German shark who yelled HEEGOTCHA to scare are people off whom had 34 cartoons) are not here. If this DVD set does well enough, I think MGM will release all of these cartoons in their own right (The Ant and the Aardvark and half of The Inspector have been released).
Also, this DVD comes with a few bonus features like the new documentary Behind the Feline: The Cartoon Phenomenon. A new interview with one of the surviving animators of The Pink Panther Art Leonardi called Pink Patter With Art Leonardi: The Story Behind the Animation. A tribute to the late Friz Freleng on the feature Remembering Friz: A Tribute to Friz Freleng. A documentary on how to draw The Pink Panther called Think Pink: How to Draw the Pink Panther. Plus the sequence Page to Screen: The Making of Two Cartoons. Lastly, you get the animated Main Title Sequences From Five of the Feature Pink Panther Films.
This DVD is a must for fans of classic animation and Pink Panther in general.
Highly recommended!",1221782400,3,3039,4.703564727954972
2317094,5,B0009S4J2I,"The Pink Panther has always remained a very important figure in the history of modern animation. A character like this one who uses only physical actions to speak for him definitely has universal/worldwide appeal. So, it turned out to be a dream come true when this remarkable 5-disc DVD set entitled ""The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection"" was released. It contains 124 classic Pink Panther cartoon shorts together on 5 DVDs. Overall, this set is a really great value for your investment. It truly belongs in every DVD home library. Starting off with the first in the series, the Academy Award winning ""The Pink Phink"", every short is presented in chronological order through the rest of the discs. I remember watching these cartoons shorts when I was a kid; and now, it is an even bigger thrill to be able to share them with my graddaughter. This has become my favorite DVD release of the year 2006, and my second favorite DVD release of all time! No wonder The Pink Panther has become my very all-time favorite cartoon character!",1219968000,3,1038,4.804469273743017

That was a long time ago, but i now get the same kind of great feeling with this awesome new collection. It contains all of the original cartoons, minus the inspector ones, which you can actually purchase from amazon. So, at this great price, you are getting all of the original classics that make us remember what it is like to be kids.",1217203200,4,472,4.375
2317116,5,B0009S4J2I,"this is the best cartoon i've ever seen, u get a set of 5 dvds with this reasonable price. i love it and i'm still on the 1st dvd. i love the pink panther, i love him and i love it!!! ^_____^",1213833600,,191,3.5714285714285716
2317117,3,B0009S4J2I,"Why only 3?  The offensive front material is a part of it.  I have to watch clips of lousy movies that have nothing to do with the Pink Panther, and then I get a lecture (on EACH disk) about not downloading pirated movies, and then finally I can watch what I paid to watch.

As far as content, I'd like the option of not hearing the laugh track.  And the rest is all my fault, since I watched the originals.  I was younger, and I guess anything Pink Panther was hip in those days, according to my taste at the time.  There are indeed some gems, and there are some real stinkers.

Especially when you get out to 1978, you can see the writers ran out of ideas, and much contrived junk writing crept in.  Not as bad as new stuff, but almost as if they knew they were writing for little kids and adjusted their efforts accordingly.

Separately, I have ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" DVD.  I would say A&A and the Inspector saved the show.  It's nice to complain about cartoons adding new features and sidekicks, but the New Pink Panther series would have been a total bust if they had to rely on what they could come up with in the purely Pink Panther episodes.

So that's why 3 stars.  Offensive front material and unnecessary laugh tracks cost them two stars.  It's my own fault for not remembering just how bad the later stuff was compared to the earlier stuff.  If I had remembered, I would like to have have just ordered the first 2 or 3 disks.  And ""The Ant and the Aardvark.""  I'm not a cartoon historian.  I just watch for entertainment.",1210723200,6,1537,4.29616724738676

However, once they started watching the episodes, it was our joy to hear their laughter, and how that this episode (then another and another) was SO funny, they HAD to watch it again.  If you know of the Pink Panther from the cartoon series, you know what to expect.  This is a complete set, so it's all here.  We parents enjoy it for the nostalgia, and it is our pleasure to introduce our children to something that they can find just as funny as we ever did.  If you like the Pink Panther, and/or have children to give this to, don't hesiate to buy it.  Then sit back and watch the fun (on screen as well as on their faces!).",1202688000,3,801,4.162337662337662

2317121,5,B0009S4J2I,"The Pink Panther is the funniest, coolest cartoon series ever created. The Pink Panther was purposely done in a crude style, and the cartoons lampoon everything in society with a sense of glee and humor. This is a five star set of one of the best cartoon series ever produced.

I also think it's important to point out that Friz Freleng, the creator of Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig, considered The Pink Panther his greatest and funniest creation.

Although the veritable Panther only speaks a few times in the entire series, it is easy to figure out what he is thinking as he tries to get through each of the stories presented in the 125 shorts made for MGM from 1964-1980.

Silent comedy this is not, because although there is little or no dialogue, the soundtrack is peppered with wonderfully zippy sound effects that add to the delight of each little movie.

Enjoy the return of the incredible pink cat!",1200268800,2,902,4.61875

She would look in the beginning credits, and if there were no voices listed, she'd say, ""Again??!  No talking again!?!""
I love these, although they are very short so you have to watch in short chunks of time.  Some people would like that, though, I'm sure.  Many of the storylines are very predictable--you can see the end coming a mile away--but it's worth it to just see the cool Panther and the very cool music playing.

There is over 14 hours of non-stop ""Pink Panther"" and even I must admit that after 3 hours straight I started to get pink eye. There is definitely too much to watch and I suggest getting you're pink fix in small doses. I don't know what kind of restoration went into this ultimate collection, but the cartoon images are definitely better than I remember seeing on television. In my opinion the video transfer and colors are excellent and the sound is pretty decent given the age of the material. My single biggest complaint about this box set is the terrible packaging that the manufacturer decided to use. The 5 disc digipak slides into a real cool looking vinyl case. It's extremely hard to grab hold of the digipak and pull it out when it's in the vinyl case. The other problem is that discs 2 & 3 and 4 & 5 sit on top of one another making them hard to get at and easier to scratch if your not careful. Overall this ultimate collection is a must for ""Pink Panther"" fans, so make lots of popcorn because this is one set the whole family can definitely wrap their paws around.

All the talent from the character created by Fritz Freleng.",1163030400,2,153,4.884615384615385
2317162,5,B0009S4J2I,"I bought this for my kids to watch in the car while running errands around town and on long trips. I always LOVED the old  70's Pink Panther Cartoons! This is a wonderful collection to own for all parents and for any Pink Panther Cartoon fans!!! I believe there's something for everyone in this box. I'm always a little biased toward ""Pinkarella"", but who wouldn't be? My kids LOVE it. It has been the ONLY DVD to remain in the car over 6 months (we only keep our favorites in the car for repeat viewing!), and the kids STILL ask to turn it on and watch it every time I start to buckle them in. GOOD OLD FASHIONED PHYSICAL HUMOR---and lots of it!! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!",1162684800,2,675,4.31496062992126

But when I bought it I was expecting to get the whole Pink Panther Show, I mean there are no Ant & Aardvark, The Inspector, Roland & Rattfink,The Tijuana Toads, The Blue Racer, Hoot Kloot etc.

Just Pink Panther cartoons, which are very entretaining for everyone but I was expecting the real deal...anyway,now that you know I'm sure you won't be dissapointed by this cool looking box set, you'll be getting over 13 hrs. of clean, harmless fun.",1162425600,8,555,4.55
2317164,5,B0009S4J2I,"The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection was for me, Matt's mother.  This collection is excellent.  The picture and sound quality are flawless.

2317171,4,B0009S4J2I,"This collection does a good job compiling the best Pink Panther cartoons.  Some of these volumes, I have bought individually, especially Volumes 1 and 2. The shows from 1964-1968 were the best. The funniest are from 1965, 1966 and 1967 and had the catchiest background music from Henry Mancini's orchestra.  However, I didn't like some of the '70s shows or the lousy ABC Saturday morning cartoon series from 1980. I remembered watching that season when I was young and the music sounded too fast, too keyboard heavy. And their version of the Pink Panther theme sounded like an MTV take of it, even if that network wasn't created at the time. The animation action was too rapid. It's like they were trying too hard to bring the classic 1960s cartoons to an '80s audience. Their creativity slipped between 1975 and 1980, when Hanna-Barbera Productions' cartoons were so dominant. That's the only criticism I have about this package--the later works from Geoffrey/Depatie/Freling weren't their best and the earlier efforts were.",1155600000,4,1025,5.059171597633136

Well, all of the above is true of me!  This is a great collection with every Pink Panther cartoon ever made!  The TV may seem smaller since you have grown up and are now bigger than it, but the comedy won't let you down.  Just don't let that inspector catch you, he doesn't want you to buy this set...",1154908800,3,449,4.103448275862069

2317177,5,B0009S4J2I,"Those fine moments most of us had while watching the TV show of the Pink Panther while kids (I'm in my mid-30's now), live again with the release of this excellent DVD boxed-set.

Video and audio quality are just the best, as I had a couple of VHS original tapes with some Pink Panther episodes, I can feel the difference between the two (of course VHS can't ever match DVD, but nevertheless, the image looks much cleaner and the audio is very good).

Although a little bit expensive, it is worth every penny.

Go do yourself a favor and buy it, you won't regret it.",1151280000,5,566,4.371428571428571

so good... if you like this cartoon go for it!!!

two very thumbs up for this DVD!!!",1150588800,,200,3.95
2317179,3,B0009S4J2I,"I would enjoy it more if ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" cartoons were included.  I don't mind that the ""Misterjaw,"" ""Texas Toads,"" and ""The Inspector"" cartoons aren't here.  However, the producers of this boxed set missed out by not including ""The Ant and the Aardvark.""

I was surprised that I remembered so many of these cartoons.  I had forgotten several of them.  I remember when the ""Pink Panther"" show was only thirty minutes long.  The show ran two ""Pink Panther"" cartoons with one by ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" in between.  The Pink Panther was a major part of my childhood on Saturday mornings.  Sometimes, it's fun to be reminded of those days.  I hope ""The Ant and the Aardvark"" will soon join ""The Pink Panther"" on DVD.",1146441600,19,727,4.6171875
2317180,3,B0009S4J2I,"that this long awaited collection didn't include ""The Inspector"" or ""The Ant & The Ardvark"" cartoons.  The Inspector is one of my all time favorites!  I still may buy this collection but am most certainly dissappointed that MGM left out 2 classics that certainly should have been included.  Hopefully someone will release a complete set of the Inspector and Ant & The Ardvark cartoons sometime in the near future.",1143763200,13,413,4.956521739130435
2317191,1,B0009S4J2I,"If, as customer reviews state, this 5 DVD box does not include the wonderful ""Inspector"" cartoons - why does the Amazon editorial at the head of the page declare ""Episodes of this series feature three theatrical cartoons, two with the Pink Panther, and one featuring the Inspector, a cartoon version of the accident-prone, bumbling French detective, Inspector Clouseau, played in movies by Peter Sellers. The Inspector is often assisted by a Spanish gendarme, Sergeant Deux-Deux, and together they fallibly battle villains of all shapes and sizes in various parts of the world, always on the orders of the long-suffering Surete Commissioner""?

I am mystified, but rather believe the customer reviews which say that the box does not contains these great additional cartoons.  Why the confusion, Amazon?  This is seriously misleading!",1143763200,22,832,5.384615384615385
2317192,3,B0009S4J2I,"I love the cartoons, but I was expecting all (not just some) of the movie title sequences to be included.  In particular, I remember one title sequence - which started with the Pink Panther moving his rear end in time with the music -  that was known at the time for being made using a very high-quality process...possibly computer animation.  As such, the motion was incredibly smooth.  As someone who loves animation, I was really hoping this title sequence would be included and am disappointed that it is not.",1143244800,,513,4.730337078651686
2317193,4,B0009S4J2I,"I bought the three individual DVDs of the Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection not realizing this set has two additional discs with more cartoons and extras like ""Behind the Feline."" Not only that but, through Amazon, it's only a few bucks more, so now I am seeing red,...er, pink.  If you really like PP, don't make the same mistake I did.  Get this collection.  If you don't want to invest in quite so much pink, get disc 1 individually.  It has ""Pink, Plunk, Plink"" which includes a cameo appearance by Henry Mancini, and ""Sink Pink"" and ""Pink Ice"" that has PP speaking! The reason I am dropping a star is because, as other reviewers have noted, The Inspector and The Aardvark cartoons are not included.  I remember them when I watched PP reruns as a kid.  I particularly remember The Inspector because I have a viewmaster reel of one of their cartoons.  Those shows added variety to the PP show and, to be complete, they should have been included.  If they were, I would have bought this set when it was first released. Another thing annoying about this set, and it's not really the fault of the set, it was just how the cartoons were made, is the laugh track on a handful of them.  PP was a mildly amusing cartoon.  It didn't have roll-on-the-floor humor but was laid-back (especially the ones without voices, compare these to the in-your-face cartoons of today) with the cool background music that could produce a chuckle here and there.  It was certainly more restrained than Bugs Bunny.  A laugh track just doesn't fit.  It is fun to see how un-PC the cartoons were back in the day.  PP smokes and there is plenty of guns, violence, and a little racial humor sprinkled in.  I can't describe all the cartoons as that would make this review longer than Amazon permits, but here are a few highlights and lowlights:

The Pink Phink:  According to the box, this ep. won an award.  PP makes life miserable for a painter to ensure his new home is pink.

Pink Pajamas:  PP crashes at the home of an alcoholic who calls his sponsor after seeing PP (probably a worse sign than seeing a pink elephant).

Dial P for Pink:  PP foils a safe burglar.  At the beginning, the burglar turns the dial on the safe and it turns on like a radio.  He has to unplug it.

Sink Pink: The first episode with voices.  A hunter in the safari hopes to build another ark to round up 2 of every animal-but he's missing a PP, which would make a great rug for the misses.  PP, himself, speaks in this one.

Pickled Pink:  (V) An alcoholic brings home PP and has to hide him from his nagging wife.  He hides him in the fridge at one point and, when he comes back, he finds PP has turned blue (""Oh, hi Blue Panther, have you seen a Pink Panther?"")

Pinkfinger:  (V) The first with a disembodied voice.  This one encourages PP to be a secret agent.  I'm not sure if it's edited, but it ends weird (how did the voice end up in an underground cellar with a lion and why was PP so bummed at the end after getting his man?).

Shocking Pink: (V) (LT) The first with a laugh track which I find annoying.  The disembodied voice berates PP for being lazy (""Why pay $7.50/hour for a plumber?"").

Pink Ice:  (V) PP the miner competes with two bumblers mining for diamonds.  Another rare one where PP speaks!

Pink Panzer:  Disembodied voice turns PP and his neighbor against each other.

An Ounce of Pink: PP buys a talking scale/fortune teller.

Reel Pink:  PP goes fishing and uses an uncooperative worm and encounters a cantankerous crab.

Bully for Pink:  PP tries out as a toreador.  Why does the bull sound like an elephant?

Pink Punch:  (Laugh Track) This ep is annoying.  PP tries to advertise his beverage but a green asterisk insists on being the dot in the ""i"" in ""Pink.""

Pink Pistons:  PP buys a little blue bug (don't worry, he paints it pink) and gets into a race with Granny Flash.  Can you believe PP was able to get his money back from a used car salesman?

Vitamin Pink:  PP's wild west vitamins give an escaped convict enough strength to break into a safe.  PP is made sheriff to recapture him.

Pink, Plunk, Plink:  PP joins a symphony orchestra and insists on playing his theme song.  Henry Mancini is seen in the audience (actually, he's the only one in the audience!).

Super Pink:  One of my favorites!  Even with the laugh track, it's funny.  PP decides to be a superhero and keeps trying to save the same poor little old lady who must have the worse luck in the world.

Rock-A-Bye Pinky:  PP hounds a snoring camper who keeps blaming his poor, loyal dog for his misfortunes (this storyline would be used in several PP eps).

Jet Pink:  I remember this ep well because it is featured on Viewmaster reels I had as a kid (and still have).  PP tries his hand (uh, paw) at being a pilot.

Pinto Pink:  Another ep featured on my Viewmaster reels.  PP tries to ride a hilarious horse.

Congratulations, It's Pink:  PP sets out to steal a picnic basket but gets a baby in a basket instead.  At one point, he leaves it with an Indian couple and the husband becomes irate and attacks the white trading post guy.  Definitely not PC!

The Hand is Pinker Than the Eye:  PP sneaks into a magician's home and encounters magic props and an amorous rabbit.

Pink Out:  Weak ep.  Just various clips that end with a pink screen.

Pinkadilly Circus:  After a man removes a nail from PP's foot, PP is so grateful, he insists on being the man's slave.  The man finds good use for PP against his nagging wife.

Psychedelic Pink:  (LT) Very strange ep, hence the title.  PP visits the Bizarre Book Shop and wants to read ""The Love Life of the Panther"" (that's funny).  From there, the ep goes all over the place.

The Pink Quarterback:  PP chases after a rolling quarter that could buy him a hot dog or a hamburger (it must be the 1960s).

Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Pink:  PP builds a house in the view of an observation telescope.

Pink Valiant:  A favorite of mine.  A king hires PP to rescue his kidnapped daughter (who just runs around screaming).  The kidnapper ends up as the one who really needs saving.

The Pink Package Plot:  PP is forced to deliver a ticking package to the Slobvanian embassy.

Pinkcome Tax:  PP (in Robin Hood style) tries to save a man imprisoned for his inability to pay taxes.

Pink-a-Rella: PP gets his paws on magic witch's wand and turns a poor, plain Jane into a princess so she can win a date with Pelvis Parsely.  Funny part:  Pelvis tries the slipper on PP.

Extinct Pink:  (LT) This may be the worst PP ep ever.  All it is is PP, a caveman, and dinosaurs competing over a bone.

Gong with the Pink:  (LT) PP is a waiter at Gong Ho Restaurant and bangs the gong for orders which is next door to a glass shop.  Full of Asian stereotypes.  Definitely not PC!

Pink-In: (V) PP reads an old pal's letter and reminisces.  This is a flashback ep with clips from Pink Package Plot, Pink Pajamas, and Pickled Pink.  Weak.

Pink Aye:  (LT) PP is a stowaway on the Luxitania (yes, that's the name)  and becomes an opera singer's stole.  It has a weak ending with the old lounge chair gag.

Pink Da Vinci:  PP keeps changing the mouth of the Mona Lisa.

Salmon Pink/Pink Elephant:  These two eps have the same premise.  PP feeds an animal (fish and elephant) and each winds up his pet.  The writers must have been running out of ideas.",1143072000,67,7330,4.416228399699474

2317195,5,B0009S4J2I,I really  enjoyed seeing some of the old classic episodes. I was blown away by how many there were! My kids are now watching them all.

Alexander from Kansas City. I am ""greatly"" disappointed that ""The Inspector"" was not included, or that those Cartoons have not been made available on DVD or VHS. The Inspector is without a doubt one of the funniest Cartoons out. I also wouldn't mind seeing ""The Ant & The Aardvark, speaking of which, to Reviewer James C.

2317214,4,B0009S4J2I,"There is no doubt the Pink Panther cartoon series ranks as one of Hollywood and Television's finest. Adults who grew up with these classic cartoons on Saturday morning will rejoice in watching these restored wonders. Youngsters will appreciate the sleek master of pantomime, who only twice spoke a word or two. And there has never been a more memorable straight man than the classic 'little-white-man-with-moustache' character (based on Friz Freleng).

All 124 Pink Panther cartoon shorts produced between 1964 and 1980 are here in this (long overdue) comprehensive five-DVD set. Picture and audio quality is the finest it has ever been, and the packaging is a child's (and adult's!) delight. The DVDs are housed in a puffy vinyl slipcase (resembling VHS clamshell cases), and are secured in quad-folded plastic trays that neatly allow the discs to be stored side-by-side.

Though the first 62 Pink Panther shorts were originally produced for theatrical release, it was after NBC started airing the shorts on Saturday morning in September 1969 did the official ""Pink Panther Show"" enter living rooms. Each 30-minute show consisted of two 'Panther' shorts, with a third short sandwiched between the two, featuring other characters (Inspector Clouseau, the Ant & the Aardvark, Tijuana Toads, Misterjaw, etc.). The three shorts were then linked with bumper segments narrated by Marvin Miller.

""The Pink Panther Show"" also featured the infamous laugh track, added to the soundtrack to give the show a more 'adult' feel (this was standard practice in the U.S. during the 60s and 70s). Though it is admirable that MGM wanted to release a complete collection of 'panther'-only shorts, it is these NBC-TV versions that are best remembered, and this is how MGM should have compiled these classics cartoons.

Ah, the laugh track. The same people laughing for over 15 years. So hated, yet it feels weird without it, especially if one has grown up with those canned guffaws. 12 shorts in this set contain the giggles on the soundtrack:

- SHOCKING PINK (1965)
- AN OUNCE OF PINK (1965)
- PINK PUNCH (1966)
- THE PINK BLUEPRINT (1966)
- SUPER PINK (1966)
- PSYCHEDELIC PINK (1968)
- PINK IN THE CLINK (1968)
- EXTINCT PINK (1969)
- PINK TUBA-DORE (1971)
- GONG WITH THE PINK (1971)
- PINK AYE (1974)
- TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINK (1974)

Interestingly enough, SHERLOCK PINK (1976), which for years was the sole entry available in the TV version (laughs intact), is finally given the silent treatment here. Knowing the capabilities of DVDs, MGM should have taken a lesson from the ""M*A*S*H"" DVD releases, and allowed the viewer to watch each cartoon with several audio options:

- with laugh track (TV version)
- without laugh track (theatrical version)
- 'music-only' soundtrack - remember that these shorts contain not only Henry Mancini's classic 'Pink Panther' theme, but the superb musical scores of Walter Greene.

It is obvious that MGM is trying their hardest to promote the Steve Martin PINK PANTHER movie by releasing this set when they did. At some point, a re-release of these cartoons, in their original TV broadcast format with Marvin Miller's narrator, would be in order. The fans then have more audio options, access to the classic Inspector/Misterjaw/Ant & Aardvark cartoons, and so on. With TV shows being released on DVD every ten seconds (how about ""The Pink Panther Show"" - The Complete First Season, 1969-1970?), it only makes sense to give the pink feline and his buddies their due.

For now, Pink Panther fans will have to make do with what is already a fantastic set to begin with.",1140048000,24,3592,5.0033500837520934
2317215,4,B0009S4J2I,"I bought this collection the day it came out. Even though there are a few flaws such as the disc holder design and no soundtrack only option, this is a great collection. I have watched the first disc, and part of the second. However, I have yet to see the anteater or inspector cartoons. Are those on this collection? if anyone knows, please let me know. Overall, you should buy this collection because the Pink Panther is a funny and cool cartoon that remains a timeless classic that brings back childhood memories.",1139356800,5,516,4.619565217391305
2317216,3,B0009S4J2I,"Agree with most reviews here about the content.  Too bad some of the toons do not feature the original theatrical tracks.

As to the extras....the list looks substantial, but most of it is just fluff.  The ""animated credit sequences"" from the Sellers films are presented 1.85:1 and slightly squeezed!  Why?  If you want to see these the way they were meant to be seen, you'll have to buy the movies!  The sequences are in no way otherwise different from those presented in the actual films.",1138838400,8,490,4.705882352941177
2317217,3,B0009S4J2I,"I have been a life-long fan of the Pink Panther, and am ecstatic that these cartoons have finally been compiled and released in a single collection -- plus, the picture quality is the best it's ever been. Unfortunately, the collection offers 124 cartoons with ""Pink"" in the title of each -- and utterly no help in navigating through it. The 8-page booklet looks like it was assembled begrudgingly as an afterthought. Excluding the front and back cover, it includes a two-page essay (""The Evolution of the World's Hippest Cat""), a three-page list of cartoon titles (with original release dates and which disc to find them on), and a one-page advertisement for ""Pink Merchandise"" (such as T-shirts, watches, books and more DVDs). It is frustrating and near impossible to remember which cartoon is which when all have titles like ""Pink-In,"" ""In the Pink,"" ""Pink Out,"" ""Pink Aye,"" ""Pink, Plunk, Pink,"" etc. A one-sentence synopsis for each cartoon would have been helpful, or maybe even a picture to jog your memory. (The disc menus are no help either in this regard; they too list only the titles.) Also, the packaging is odd. The DVDs are held in a quad-folded piece of carboard with plastic trays that clumsily overlap the placement of some of the discs. It is housed in a puffy vinyl slipcase which looks like something for pre-school children. The original Pink Panther theatrical shorts were made with broader audiences in mind. For instance, the second cartoon on Disc 1 (""Pink Pajamas"") depicts an alcoholic/insomniac who, upon seeing the Pink Panther, calls up a friend from A.A. Together they dispose of a dozen or so liquor bottles. When they both see the Pink Panther, they go chasing after a garbage truck to retrieve the bottles and start drinking again. If you're uncomfortable with the prospect of explaining about Alcoholics Anonymous to your children, then maybe this set isn't such a great gift-idea for your household. Also, one of my favorite all-time Pink Panther theatrical shorts is ""Psychedelic Pink"" with all of its vibrant, trippy artwork. I don't believe the version on this boxed-set is the original one, but rather the one which aired on the Pink Panther Saturday morning TV show -- as it has disruptive canned laughter dubbed into the soundtrack.  If you love the original Pink Panther, I would still enthusiastically recommend getting this 5-DVD set, because if it goes out of print you might be hard-pressed to find these cartoons again.

PS -- The Pink Panther isolated soundtracks to the cartoons have never been commercially available. They feature not only Henry Mancini's music, but great soundtracks by Walter Greene. They most certainly are not included as a bonus feature on this DVD set, but -- If anyone out there reading this has the power to release these great tracks on CD, it would certainly be worthwhile looking into!

I have been waiting patiently for years to watch one of my favorite childhood shows, and now was my chance.  The store I was in offered them as 1-disc only ""volumes"", so I picked each one up and scanned the backs to see if the other Pink Panther cartoons were included (every bit as good as the Pink Panther!), only to realize that they were absent from this collection.  I don't remember off the top of my head which company is responsible for the release of this set, I just want whoever is in charge to realize their mistake of not including the ""Ant & the Aardvark"" ""Inspector Clouseu"" and I think there was a cowboy with red boots but I can't remember his name.  The Pink Panther cartoons are great, and I plan on getting them all eventually, but I was really looking forward to watching Judo say ""Si, I mean oui"" & Jackie Mason as the Aardvark turning on the 'ol Hoover vacuum.....",1138752000,15,970,4.313186813186813

2317220,1,B0009S4J2I,"I love classic animation, but truth be told, Friz Freleng had lost his comic gifts when he got into the making of these excrutiatingly painfully unfunny, boring cartoons, which dragged on for years,

They're being drudged up now to ""synergize"" with the new Steve Martin remake of Peter Sellers' PINK PANTHER movie, the release of which, has been postponed enough times to indicate a disaster.

Whatever happens with the movie, just let these cheap-o Panther cartoons rest in peace. They're really terrible, and it is typical of the latest incarnation of MGM or Sony or whoever they are, to try to make gold out of dross.

Between 1964 and 1980 there were 124 Pink Panther cartoons made (two were shown in each half hour show with a third cartoon featuring another character), and these appear to be the ones on this DVD set.

Bearing in mind that 34 cartoons were made of The Inspector alone and 17 of The Aardvark, a DVD collection of ALL the cartoons that made up the half hour show would fill far more than 5 DVDs.",1138579200,13,551,4.5

2317236,5,B0009S4J2I,"This review is dedicated to people that do not know Freleng and De Patie's work because those who know it do not need any review.

Masterpieces. All their cartoons are intelligent and funny. In this DVD you have ""Pink Panther"", one of the most famous cartoons of the world.

Other exceptional cartoons not included in this collection are ""The Inspector"", ""Tijuana Toads"", ""The Ant and the Aaardwark"" and let us not forget that blue snake and the that japanese bug, all from Friz Freleng and De Patie.
All of excellent quality.

For me these guys are cartoon geniuses.",1130112000,8,567,4.76530612244898
2317237,4,B0009S4J2I,"These cartoons are really funny. Freleng and Depatie were Warners stalwarts who created their own company and along with being contracted to make some Looney Tunes (so-so ones mostly as many of the greats e.g. Carl Stalling had reired) they were asked to do the titles for the original Pink Panther movie. This was almost as popular as the feature itself and the character was spun off into this cartoon series. This release is supposedly the whole collection of the original series. Although a little patchy there are many hilarious cartoons and there is around 13 hours worth of great family viewing. I find a few at a time is best as the repeated theme tune and gaudy colours can become irritating.

The screen fit of the cartoons is a little disconcerting in the titles (parts of the title is cut off) and will no doubt annoy purists but in the actual cartoons it doesn't detract from the humour so if that is the main thing you're after don't be too worried. Lots of laughs gauranteed.",1126569600,4,990,4.625
2317238,5,B0009S4J2I,"This collection is truly amazing. It has already been released here in Australia at a very reasonable price of between AU $55 - 65. It is a great set but devoid of any special features / extras. That is okay, if not for the decision to place back bars on top and botton of the screen effectively cutting the original picture information so that it would fit better on the newer widescreen TVs. Here is hoping the US version will preserve the original 1:33 aspect and showing us the full picture.",1126137600,8,495,4.450549450549451
2317239,5,B0009S4J2I,"The Pink Panther is among the classics of cartoons. full of laughter and great music. Another great related cartoon, which I sure hope they also release on DVD, is The Inspector series, that series is also hilarious.",1122336000,,216,4.864864864864865

Why the hell did they gone to the trouble to make 16:9 versions of this? :( :( Unfortunately I still couldn't but this set but it's on my wishlist. I just wish (and I was waiting a few years to see if they would) they added the episodes from the PINK PANTHER AND SONS cartoon series which had the coolest theme song ever from a 80's series. Or at least just one episode.

They will never make a proper Pink Panther edition of the movies without THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER in the set.
