The card will please the nostalgics, even matches like Sgt. Slaughter Vs. King Kong Bundy are suprisingly good. Only the Dusty Rhodes Vs. Kamala match is terrible....Dusty looks like being drunk/wasted and Kamala....well, is Kamala (good gimmick but no skills)...

Anyway, I'm always happy to find such little treasures for such a cool price !!!",1224547200,,526,4.645161290322581
