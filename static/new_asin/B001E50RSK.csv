3545666,5,B001E50RSK,Excellent period piece dealing with the Kennedy assassination. Mark Lane show a calm demeanor and doesn't back down in the face of Buckley's assertions.,1377734400,,152,5.375
3545667,5,B001E50RSK,"I usually do not like to buy these types of serious interview shows, but for historical events, I like to see full interviews from around the time period that it happened.  Mark Lane (Moshe Levine) has been a long-time critic of the Warren Commission and William F. Buckley was indeed a CIA contact, so I thought this would be interesting.

I won't go too much into the interview except to say that it is 100% about the JFK assassination and not about anything else.  I would have been mad if it were.  The quality of the disc was of big concern to me as the last few DVD's (I mainly buy Blu-Ray) I bought were movies that only used a single layer disc.  Then I thought, this is only a 1 hour shows so a single layers disc is OK.  With that said, the quality is very good and so is that packaging.  It is an Amazon manufactured disc, but the quality was great.  The only difference in quality between this and a store bought is the blue dye on the bottom.  The top side is silk screened so that is a plus.

I would recommend the disc as it does appear to come from studio master tapes (remastered of course) and is top quality.  I still cannot get over the very different time/style changes from the 1960's to now or even from the 1960's to the 1970's!  It was put together well.  I would probably have Amazon put some of mine together...",1265932800,7,1338,4.241106719367589
3545668,5,B001E50RSK,"Another ""Firing Line"" show that I had missed due the exigencies of college, I came to this viewing having a skewed bias against Mark Lane, being the second assassination investigator of my acquaintance. However, this show, will reveal to others similarly biased, that Mark Lane's legwork holds up today. You see him deftly retort Mr. Buckley at every turn, appearing like a bespectacled James Garner with the courtroom chops of Gerry Spence. Despite sparring with Lane courteously and sympathetically at times, Mr. Buckley reveals Mr. Lane's valid competence and uncanny recall of assassination facts to be on sum worth exploration rather than dismissal. One fact alone, the utterance of JFK caught by one trailing secret service agent, "" My, God, I've been shot"" in the sequence of events, as explained by the bemusedly, pipe-smoking Mr. Lane, lends great substance to his investigative efforts, weighed against the volumes of hidden testimony by the biased, bungling Dallas Police in the service of the Warren Commission's conclusion. It was surprising to see Mr. Buckley silently admire Mr. Lane's courageous efforts to get at the truth, while attempting to lead Mr. Lane down the commie conspiracty primrose lane. Engrossing viewing and listening.",1238025600,9,1251,5.3232323232323235

Naturally, Mark Lane is more conversant than William Buckley about the details of the Warren Commission, having written a book about it.

8296401,5,B001E50RSK,"In the days that followed Kennedy's assassination there was much speculation of who, that is to say what ""power"" could have designed and executed the plan to kill the then president of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

The truth is pretty apparent that it was Lee Harvey Oswald, a disgruntled ""loner"" who found himself meandering through life in search of something to give himself purpose and notoriety, who acted alone, and perhaps acted also to impress the communist forces (notably Cuba) as to his capabilities.

I've heard stories about cabals of various sorts; conspiracies of high ranking US generals, conspiracies of CEOs, oil barons, the mafia, and a plethora of other theories  regarding who was involved and the wherefores.

It strikes me that George Herbert Walker Bush executed the largest war the US has been involved in since the end of the Second World War.  He corralled numerous states into a coalition of nations to act against one of the world's last ""great dictators"" in the traditional fascist sense; Saddam Hussein.  A move which surely would have upset the Arab, Persian and Islamic world combined, and did, nation and territorial region depending.  And given our action in Panama, our action in squaring off against the PRC and their navy as they threatened to take Taiwan numerous times (we have always deployed a CVBG to meet the challenge), as well as squaring off with North Korea and even the Soviet Union, that he, that is former president George H.W. Bush, would have been a more likely target for assasination than Kennedy ever could have been; even more-so since he oversaw the fall of the Soviet Union and reunification of Germany.

And yet, as I write this review, he is currently in his 90s, and being cared for in a Texas hospital for a breathing ailment.  And, the one, and it was only one, assassination plot against him, was actually from Saddam Hussein himself.  A plot that was foiled some years ago.

But, reflecting back on the 60s and 70s, when you're ""in the thick of it"", so to speak, it is easy to allow oneself to be blinded by notions that fleetingly seem entertaining, and so entertaining that one wonders, and then subsequently considers, their voracity in plausible illumination.  This idea is further propelled by what one could say was ""sloppy"" or inadequate police work on the part of the Dallas PD.  But, as Buckley points out, simply because a report does not meet with complete satisfaction, does that mean that a conspiracy of any sort was the cause?  No.

Mark Lane rattled a lot of cages when he put his book to the public criticizing the Warren Commission's findings regarding the JFK Assassination.  People, honest people, honest people are are typically not great critical thinkers and who rely on the better judgment of the educated to inform them so that they make a sound assessment, were led to suspect the Warren Commission's report was inadequate.  And thereby perhaps conclude that there were ""dark forces"" working behind closed doors to do away with presidents or other persons that dissatisfied them.

Buckley opens up by asking Lane that of all the deaths associated with the assassination event, all presumably people who might have had knowledge or acted as witness, and thus were murdered as potential litigative weapons on behalf of some prosecutor, how is it that they missed him?  Buckley also helps illuminate the specious logic of adding inference to questions so as to suggest willful wrongdoing verse an inquiry of why a set of facts is incomplete.

I think the only time Buckley misspeaks is more a matter of personal interpretation; i.e. when he is asked about his personal concern he eschews a desire to know who it was that killed the president, and is more concerned with the fact that the president is dead, and that whoever did kill the president ought to be held accountable.  I think for a lot of viewers, and specifically those who were deep admirers of president Kennedy, this may come across as lacking heart or human feeling for the president, and thus in those persons' minds it may seem borderline callous or even unpatriotic.  But the truth of the matter is that the president is not a loved one of his family, but the leader of his nation, and as a human being he certainly feels for the death of another, but the business of the nation must press onward.  Part of that business is to deal with the changing world scenario and ramifications of losing the president of the United States.

Buckley is also clear to point out that he was satisfied with the Warren Commission's report because the actual murder of the president did not have the heir of being a well executed plan by some ensemble of corrupt military, corporate heads and whoever else the imagination might include in such a conspiracy.  As an example; Anwar Sadat was assassinated during a military parade exercise when the assassins leapt from an APC in a mock demonstration of special forces tactics, and gunned him down as he looked on from the stands.  Several gunmen were involved.  It involved aspects of the Egyptian military (low ranking officers) and was done by more than one person, and was well planned and executed as a team oriented operation.  There are other examples.  And to this effect, Oswald's singleton modus operandi demonstrated that it had to be the work of a single madman.

And yet the paranoia persists to this very day.  And even reading the other reviews, one is curious as to what program Buckley critics watched to conclude that Mark Lane ""beat"" or ""trounced"" one the great conservative journalists.

But the framing of the time is that we were in a contest against the Soviet Union, whose goals were to spread communism throughout the world.  With that in mind, how could one not but consider the idea that the communists in some form, had an interest or possible hand in the president's assassination?  And, as it turns out, the Cubans had knowledge of Oswald's proposal.  Even so, that is far from saying that they backed and help implement the plot (which may be the case, but does not seem likely at the time of this writing, some forty years after the event).

In short, it's probably a good thing to be suspicious and curious, and to this extent, wonder who are the possible components of a murder.  But it is another to let the creative portion of the brain embrace a kind of paranoia and therefore entertain and put forth possibilities of paid murderers among companies and elected officials for the purpose of power gains.  Because if that is so, then one has to wonder about the society in which the assassination took place.  But, that is a far cry from establishing a set of facts, and making rational judgment based upon them.

Mark Lane raised interesting questions about operational minutiae in the procedures and personnel who handled the killing and death of former president Kennedy, but his implicit energy for a home grown junta, as Buckley attempted to demonstrate, was irrational and irresponsible.

But, don't take my word for it.  Watch it and judge for yourself.",1420761600,,7097,4.816982687551525

Buckley is his usual self- smirking, snide and snake like with his verbal attacks on Mark Lane. Lane is cool thoughout and when he's allowed to rebut Buckley's assertions; he helps illuminate the issues with the Warren Report. Obviously, the film quality is not great as this was recorded in the mid 60's, but it's a valuable piece of American history. I do recommend everyone interested in the JFK assassanation to check this out!",1390348800,,524,4.822222222222222
8296405,5,B001E50RSK,"Few times have I ever stopped an interview like this and stopped to ask  wait whoa! What did he actually say?

Mark Lane asks one of the most important questions Ive ever heard in this debate from that period in time  how come The FBI, Local Police, and Secret Service allow Lee Harvey Oswald enter a building along JFKs parade route with a gun on that same morning of said parade route! Apparently there was some security who were checking people out in the area

Did anyone one of his fellow co-workers seem concerned that on the day Kennedy was going to be passing through that street that Oswald brought a gun to work that day?

Mr. Mark Lane should be saluted for being one of the first to through the BS flag and call out former President and Co-Conspirator Johnson for his complicity in the cover-up. I also have to gratefully acknowledge Mr. Buckleys admission that if LBJ was part of a cover-up then that calls into question; what was he hiding?

This is an important audio-visual document that all JFK historians should view at least once and be prepared to acknowledge that many of the things we were told were lies. Even more disturbing are the apologists like Buckley who have the attitude that we must submit to authority, even when our leaders are obviously wrong  such anarchy is intolerable and should be crushed by ridicule and ostracizing dissenters and nonconformists!

The truth is out there, and was out there all along. This video proves that there were people like us who were asking thoughtful questions from the very beginning.",1384473600,2,1553,4.6838235294117645
