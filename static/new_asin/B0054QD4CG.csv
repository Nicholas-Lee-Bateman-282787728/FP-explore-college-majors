4570056,5,B0054QD4CG,"I watched this television show when I was about the same age of the child star of this show.  I liked the stories then and also now.
I wish more children shows of this quality were made today in America.  I am surprised that this show has not been released in Region 0 and 1.",1363392000,7,275,3.981818181818182
4570057,5,B0054QD4CG,I would highly recommend buying this if you enjoy similiar shows such as Lassie or Flipper. I bought it for my brother and he's very happy with having all of the shows that were produced.,1360540800,5,187,4.371428571428571
8456850,5,B0054QD4CG,"I have received this great TV classic, today, well within time frame, it actually outside time frame, 5 days earlier. Aside from this, this tv series is excellent, on par and sometimes better than Flipper. Great adventures with the actors doing there own stunts, giving it a more real look. Some great, genuine Aussie humour and themes such as modern day swagman, portraying aborigines in a proper light, and many more stories. It is also good to reminisce of 60s Sydney, and how much has changed, not necessarily for the better",1519862400,,528,4.813186813186813

8456852,5,B0054QD4CG,"Excellent video series. Watched it as a child and still enjoy every episode just as much.  One thing to watch for, when I first attempted to buy this series, I was told that I needed to have a different DVR to play the series on, so I also purchased another DVR that was capable of playing all regions. However, this was unnecessary.  When I placed the disc in my regular Region 1 DVR the discs play fine.  I guess when it says it plays in all regions that it will work in any DVR. The one that I am using is more than 15 years old and it plays the series perfectly.",1506470400,,566,4.035714285714286

8456855,4,B0054QD4CG,"When I was about 9 or 10 years old this came on saturday mornings after cartoons, it was my first
introduction to Australia. The plots for most of the shows are simple by comparison, but are
reminiscent of a more innocent time in TV series. I have always been into aviation, and they used
a Bell 47 helicopter to patrol the park which didn't hurt. I enjoy the look and feel of 1960s TV shows
and this is definitely in that category. If you enjoy watching episodes of Flipper, Lassie or Black Beauty
you will like this.",1404777600,,518,4.350515463917525
8456856,5,B0054QD4CG,"What a great trip down memory lane. Many friends have come over to watch some episodes too. Very funny in places as it was made between 1965 and 1969. Great Australiana in there also. I wasn't happy with the packaging that the DVD Box was sent in and have submitted photos of damage to the boxes. This being said, I love the set.",1388361600,4,329,4.238095238095238
