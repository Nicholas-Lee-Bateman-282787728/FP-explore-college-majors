8415448,4,B0043X1FR2,"Lucille Ball...  Loretta Young...  Gracie Allen...  Betty White...  Four of the female pioneers from the ""golden age"" of television.  With the exception of Ms Ball in ""The Lucy Show"", this 2-disc set spotlights these talented stars in their original TV vehicles, with four episodes apiece.  Granted, most of the material included here can be found in countless budget public domain TV collections in much the same quality, but this set is a nice starter for those looking to begin a collection, or even as a fun Christmas stocking-stuffer.

THE LORETTA YOUNG SHOW:
With husband Tom Lewis serving as executive producer, Loretta Young embarked on her long-running anthology series in 1953.  Originally titled ""Letter to Loretta"", each episode would typically begin with Young making a dramatic entrance into her ""living room"" to open a letter and introduce the story about to unfold.  Young starred in the majority of the episodes; an appealing mix of romantic comedies, dramas, thrillers, period pieces and religious tales.  Over time, Young garnered a sizable gallery of favourite characters, including prison-farm manager Inga, and bespactacled Sister Ann of the Mercy Hospital.  But perhaps even more famous than the show itself was Young's ""twirl"" at the beginning of each episode, with such designers as Travilla and Werl creating one-of-a-kind gowns for Young to wear as she whirled through the door.

Episodes:
""Son, This is Your Father"" - Single mother Ginny Dickerson has raised her teenage son Scott (Norman Ollestad) without a penny of support.  But when her former husband (Alan Hale Jr.) suddenly decides that he wants to play an active role in Scott's life, Ginny is filled with memories of his abandonment fifteen years earlier.

""Oh, My Aching Heart"" - In order to gain employment and win the approval of her young, workaholic boss (George Nader), Nora Patrick disguises herself with a ""plain jane"" alias, but her life soon spirals into farce.

""Lady Killer"" - Mystery author Peg Lincoln boards an aeroplane using another woman's ticket, and winds up caught in a dangerous web of political corruption and murder.

""The Count of Ten"" - Former boxing champion Tiger Tipton (Eddie Albert) returns to the ring in a last-bid attempt to save his terminally-ill wife, Maddie.

LIFE WITH ELIZABETH:
Betty White earned her very first Emmy Award for this charming sitcom, in which she played a hapless, Lucy-esque housewife who is always getting herself into sticky situations.  LIFE WITH ELIZABETH started out as a live show on Los Angeles station KLAC in 1952, and aired as part of a larger five-hour block of variety entertainment.  Del Moore co-stars as Elizabeth's husband Alvin, with future game show host Jack Narz as the on-screen narrator who sets the scene for each story.  You can definitely see the beginnings of White's beloved ""Golden Girls"" character Rose Nylund in her performance as daffy Elizabeth; she's a delight.

Episodes:
* Moosie in the Kitchen / Jungle in the Living Room / Underhills for Dinner
* Black Eye / Momma for Breakfast / Missing Receptionist
* Scared Silly / Neighbourhood Slingshot / Elmer's Garage
* The Psychic / Car Repair for Dummies / Bird Bath

THE GEORGE BURNS & GRACIE ALLEN SHOW:
""Say goodnight, Gracie"".  Sponsored by Carnation Evaporated Milk, THE GEORGE BURNS & GRACIE ALLEN SHOW provided an ideal training ground for staff writer Paul Henning, who later went on to craft his own succession of sitcom evergreens (""The Bob Cummings Show"", ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Petticoat Junction"").  Looking back on GEORGE BURNS & GRACIE ALLEN now, it functions more like a charming two-act stage play than the fluidly-filmed sitcoms which proceeded it (the revolutionary three-camera format was later introduced with ""I Love Lucy"").  Bea Benaderet co-stars as Gracie's best friend, neighbour Blanche Morton.

Episodes:
""Gracie's Bank Account"" - After discovering Gracie's haphazard system of writing cheques, George must find a delicate way of talking about the subject with her.

""Income Tax Man"" - The tax man's annual visit to the Burns household uncovers even more of Gracie's eccentricities when it comes to handling money.

""House Guest"" - George is none too pleased when Gracie's old school friend Mamie Kelly (Sarah Selby) outstays her welcome at the Burns household - with Gracie's help.

""Teenage Girl Spends the Weekend"" - George and Gracie welcome a visit from Emily (Jean Mahoney), who soon enlivens the household with her jump-dancing boyfriend.

THE LUCY SHOW:
Five years after the run of ""I Love Lucy"" and, by this time, also divorced from Desi Arnaz, Lucille Ball returned to CBS in THE LUCY SHOW, in which she again co-starred with Vivian Vance.  They played Lucille Carmichael and Viv Bagley, a divorcee and widow living together with their children in New Jersey.  The show later had a major re-tool with Lucy moving to California, where she worked as the secretary to bank executive Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).  The four episodes here come from the later 'California era' of the show.
