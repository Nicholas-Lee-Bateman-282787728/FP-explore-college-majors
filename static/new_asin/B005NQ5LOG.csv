4849113,3,B005NQ5LOG,"Let me start by saying I love the series. I was so excited to find this series at such a budget price. It started off amazing; I bought the first season and fell in love so I bought the 2nd and 3rd set of the S.A.V.E. series and was sorely disappointed. The box is a bit misleading by stating the 3rd and 4th seasons would be 16:9. Yes they are in widescreen but there were not enhanced for widescreen tvs. So what I got was this tiny little widescreen show in the middle of my widesreen TV!!! I am pissed! Such a shoddy presentation from funimation!

If you are willing to overlook the deception buy the set...if not...look somewhere else.",1341619200,4,640,4.333333333333333
4849114,4,B005NQ5LOG,"I had purchased the fourth season of Initial D a couple of years ago.  The subtitles on those episodes were ridiculous.  It was impossible to figure out what they were trying to say when one character uses the word ""elephant"" three times in the course of one sentence.  This  is about street racing; there were no animals in sight!  After hearing the voices in Japanese for the first seasons, their new English-speaking voices took some getting used to, but for the first time, season four makes sense.  The show itself is not as good this season as in past seasons, but still a good show and this translation is the way to watch it.",1341014400,,633,4.508771929824562

It was addictive as I watched each disk all the way through when I should have been studying for exams. The quality was just fine, the voice over was as expected, and the time with which I received this package in the mail was excellent. I enjoyed adding this to my collection of initial D dvds.

Back in the mid-2000s, Initial D was already an established property that many anime fans and car enthusiasts loved (including myself). With that much popularity circulating, it was only a matter of time before the US localized it and presented it to America.

So... US anime/manga distributor Tokyopop licensed the distribution rights to the Initial D anime as well as the manga it was based on.

In their attempt at creating an experience that could appeal to a wider audience, Toykopop did things that are totally unacceptable in today's US anime market.

* Names were changed/altered
* The original true-to-life car sounds were replaced with generic sound effects
* The Super Eurobeat soundtrack (a trait the series had become known for) was removed in favor of generic rap/rock music
* The computer-generated race sequences were given added ""special effects"" (this was the most questionable edit they made and still baffles me)
* A simplified translation that lost almost ALL the racing technicality in the process

Tokyopop tried to justify these edits by including the original Japanese versions of the episodes in the discs they had. But... the fans had spoken. The localization treatment Tokyopop gave to Initial D was horrible.

As time passed... it seemed like the US would never see Initial D in proper English. That is until Tokyopop lost the rights in 2008 and Funimation picked it up.

Now that the history lesson is over, it's onto the actual review :)

---

The first thing you'll notice about the Funimation version is that the original audio and soundtrack of the show has been kept in tact. They did what was originally expected the FIRST time it was being brought to America: ACCURATELY translate Initial D into English.

Initial D's dialog is one of those animes that uses a relaxed, everyday way of speaking. Tokyopop's did their best to honor this by forcefully adding in slang phrases like ""DUDE!! TAK'S EIGHT-SIX IS GETTING PUNKED!!""

Funimation also recognized the ""relaxed"" speak in their translation. But, they have scripted it in such a way that it doesn't feel forced at all. While they do use words like 'frikkin' and 'dude', the Funimation voice cast does its best to make it sound like talking and not script reading.

Also... props to the head of voice casting for finding suitable voice actors for each character (something the Tokyopop version missed by a LONGshot). Takumi, for one, sounds his age for once! But the real shining factor of the Funimation dub is that almost every character has an american voice that is pretty much an English version of their Japanese counterpart. Ryosuke Takahashi sounds pretty spot on :P

It's unfortunate that it's taken THIS long for America to get Initial D in an acceptable form. But, in the end, it was definitely worth the wait! The only thing I'm asking for now... is for a blu-ray release of this material.

And... I cannot wait until Initial D Fifth Stage is brought to US shores. Keep up the good work, Funimation :)",1366502400,14,3185,4.905027932960894
4849157,5,B005NQ5LOG,Very interesting anime with enough details to satisfy gear heads and in nice CGI graphics (i believe it was) for the time. Awesome story as well I'd say if they don't have all the season (1-4 currently) on Blu-ray which is what i  was looking for pick up one through four on DVD.,1364601600,,279,4.264150943396227
4849158,5,B005NQ5LOG,"Simple graphics and story line, but I still love it. Makes me want to buy an 86 and go race. Has english and Japanese languages and english subtitles. It's a really awesome deal specially for the price.",1363305600,2,202,4.486486486486487
4849159,5,B005NQ5LOG,"Been waiting for a while to get the series since my buddies have the japanese versions and the english subtitles just doesn't make sense at times. The rough translation sucks. Saw the S.A.V.E. editon on netflix and the voice over and subtitles makes sense and now it is better watching it and understanding what is going on. Searched for it on amazon and Bam! found it.
If you like anime or this title, get it in the S.A.V.E. version. You won't be disappointed. Fourth stage have more races to enjoy.
Hope they make a 5th stage or a feature on his dad Bunta when he was young and driving wild back in the days. That would be awesome. 24 episodes, 4 discs",1359763200,,654,4.368852459016393
4849160,5,B005NQ5LOG,"This stage does have a slightly different feel from the others but it is still good. When I read that it was mostly about the main character going around and racing all over the region I was afraid that it would have mostly him and most the other characters wouldn't show up but I was pleasantly surprised that almost all of them are in this stage a bit too, though not quite as much as in the previous stages. If you enjoyed the other stages then I'm sure you will enjoy this too.",1357862400,,481,4.182795698924731
