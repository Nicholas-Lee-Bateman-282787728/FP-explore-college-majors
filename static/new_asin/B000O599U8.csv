8182873,2,B000O599U8,"The characters in this movie take great pains to mention ad nauseam that THE HAWK, a notorious local outlaw, has been attacking and robbing them for years.  Years.  Hes a villain who knows the area well, knows who to attack, and he knows exactly when to attack.  Hes a vicious murderer to boot.  Into town rides a young stranger (John Wayne as John Drury) with a harmonica.  He rescues a horse named Duke when the idiot townsfolk put the horse on trial for assault and battery.  Later, after ingratiating himself on everyone, Drury vows to help the idiot townsfolk by tracking down THE HAWK and putting an end to his murderous raids.  Unfortunately, THE HAWK frames Drury for a recent raid by leaving Drurys harmonica at the scene of the crime.  Thats good enough for the town idiots, called the Vigilantes, lets string him up!  Not one person stops to think how a stranger to the area could be THE HAWK when obviously hes far too young............unless he started marauding when he was five!

This is probably the dumbest plot of any of these quickie-westerns of the 1930s.  It fails to make sense on any level, including having the wrong man tried by a so-called judge who lives alone in a ghost town!  This is not John Waynes finest hour.  55 minutes of utter nonsense.",1491523200,,1273,4.604444444444445
8182874,4,B000O599U8,"I love these old B&W westerns. Reminds me of Sat. matinees when I was a kid. This was one of John Wayne's 1st pictures. My Daughter has a memorabilia coffee cup with the marquee picture for this film. She always serves my coffee in this cup. Now I have the movie to go with it. In this movie, he names his horse ""Duke"". But I read that he had a dog named Duke when he was a kid in Glendale & that's how he got tagged with ""Duke"".

8182875,3,B000O599U8,"John Wayne(and his horse Duke) appear in this B Western from the early 1930s.  These films are all about the same-pleasent to watch, but not the greatest entertainment in history.  Note that in this film the costar is Duke the horse.",1359936000,,233,4.658536585365853
8182876,5,B000O599U8,Basic John Wayne good guy beats the bad guys and of course gets the girl. Good to watch whenever things are slow on TV.,1315699200,,119,4.0
8182877,5,B000O599U8,I bought this for a friend who has all of John Wayne's movies but this one. He don't have a computer & was thrilled I found it for him.,1313625600,,135,3.689655172413793
8182878,5,B000O599U8,"It'd be hard to argue that this is a western equal to THE SEARCHERS or STAGECOACH, but as a B-western, it's one of the best I've seen.  Compared to Wayne's Lone Star films, RIDE HIM, COWBOY is a great picture.  This is largely due to the photography and camerawork.  There are a couple of really outstanding dolly shots (especially the first shots of the outdoor trial and the meeting of the men after the trial).  The photography in the desert is also very nicely done.  Whereas some of Wayne's early films have a very low-budget, backlot feel, RIDE HIM, COWBOY makes good use of location photography (which was at least in part recycled from an earlier silent film) to maximize the naturalism of the setting, if not the story.

The story, however, could stand improvement.  You really have to suspend disbelief even more than usual for a B-western.  Still, most of these early westerns aren't made to withstand logical scrutiny.  And this film has decent acting (again, for a B-western).  Otis Harlan as Judge Necktie Jones delivers a particularly entertaining performance.  Wayne projects confidence when delivering his lines as well.

I don't know if this is the same print that appears on the Triple Feature DVD of RIDE HIM, COWBOY, HAUNTED GOLD, and THE BIG STAMPEDE.  If so, it makes more sense to buy the Triple Feature and get 2 more films for a couple of dollars more.  But the Triple Feature DVDs are double-sided, and from the looks of the product image, this disc is one-sided.  So if you have an aversion to double-sided discs, then avoid the Triple Feature DVDs.",1194739200,3,1577,4.7463235294117645
