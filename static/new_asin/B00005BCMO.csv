7937298,5,B00005BCMO,"This video along with the other Dora The Explorer videos are magnificent!  My daughters, ages 2 and 6, adore these shows and I have found myself singing along with them!  Both of my children have learned several spanish words and a variety of fun songs.  Dora has got there attention from beginning to end with her educational yet fun videos.  Thank you Nick Jr.!",1010361600,7,363,4.625
7937299,5,B00005BCMO,"My daughter, Rachel, was instantly taken with Dora when she first saw the Dora the Explorer program on NickJr.  The bright colors and the interactive format (Dora asks questions and Rachel answers) appeal to my preschooler.  Rachel has also become interested in making maps as a result of this show.  It's fun to listen to her speak Spanish to her baby sister, and watch her dance to the music with Dora and Boots the Monkey.
I used to be awakened by my daughter on Saturday mornings, clamoring, ""Mommy, get up!  Dora's on!  Hurry, we'll miss her!""  Fortunately, NickJr has released the videos, and mommy can now sleep in on Saturday Mornings (worth the price of the video for that alone!).
As an elementary school teacher, I can tell you that the Dora videos offer ample problem solving opportunities and good exposure to the Spanish language (3 to 5 words per episode, presented in context, and consistently reinforced).",1004918400,17,922,4.840764331210191
7937300,5,B00005BCMO,"I have two youngsters who watch Dora everyday on Nick Jr. so I decided to get these tapes...Dora uses English and Spanish to help her friends find clues to find her way to help someone or to get somewhere..To my surprise when I was listening to my children play, they were counting in Spanish..These kids are only 2 and 3..and they learned that from watching her cartoon everyday..She teaches phrases and little words that would be easy for children to remember..Dora is a good learning show for any age...",1000684800,9,506,4.696629213483146
7937301,5,B00005BCMO,"She can already say ""Backpack"", she dances to all the songs and even runs over to the TV to show Dora the 3 places they need to go.  We can't even turn the video off before the program is over or she'll start screaming.",994896000,11,219,3.977272727272727
7937302,5,B00005BCMO,"My preshool aged kids are nutz about Dora - and FINALLY a female heroine/charcter for them to follow!  They have learned as many as 20 spanish words since we started watching and not only do they know how to just say them, they KNOW what they mean and what context to use them.  Make sure you check out...onine games that your children can play!",991872000,13,345,4.375
