1904480,5,B0000AC8OJ,"Ahh, the long awaited end to the Love Hina anime series. But of course there's the manga series. First off, this is a perfect addition to your anime collection. However, if you are Love Hina fanatic, you will notice something... the manga continues on after the point where the anime leaves off. Both are great and a must buy for the Love Hina fanatic.",1058572800,2,352,4.515625
1904491,5,B0000AC8OJ,"if you are the type to like comedic anime love stories
then you will love the love hina series",1082505600,4,94,4.0
1904492,5,B0000AC8OJ,"I guess you gotta say this anime is out there but it's great. Pretty much what everyone else wrote is accurate. The humor's a little risque but it's worth it. Nothing too um...well ya know kinky. I really just wanted to say the anime doesn't end just at 25 and the specials (the movies that is). It continues! I myself have just purchased Love Hina Final Selection. It comes with the final chapter 26 of the series in addition to a bonus cd featuring some music concerts performed by the voice actors...or should I say actresses themselves, and some behind-the-scene looks. This dvd is a plus for LH fans and a MUST for diehards. Please if you haven't read the manga I STRONGLY recommend it. Though the dvd is nice it has a lot of gaps (or should I say a feeling of incompleteness) to it cuz the story is a little out of sequence and some events that would help develop the story a little more are cut out. Try the manga first if you're giving this anime a try. Ja Ne!!",1080432000,6,969,4.300546448087432
1904493,5,B0000AC8OJ,"this has been one of the best movies i have ever seen! although i don't get why it is rated R. I thought that the spring Special was worse... oops, there is one part that should have younguns eyes covered, heh heh. But i still think that there should be more movies to really complete the ending. I read at Anihina.com that Ken Akamatsu has another movie of love hina he wants to make, but it is in question, so keep your fingers crossed! But in this movie the Hinata residents get screwed with Kanako Urashima( Keitaro's little step-sister ) and better yet Naru falls in pure love with Keitaro! At the end she, sorry, can't spoil the ending. You should really buy it if you're a LH fan. I got the collecters box that came with the Christmas movie, the Spring movie, and Love Hina Again. I hope you buy it if you want the ending. But if you want a complete ending get the Manga, #1-14 are on sale now! I got only #1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 'cause I found out about Love Hina last year. But I'm still collecting.",1076371200,3,1013,4.147208121827411
1904494,5,B0000AC8OJ,"This was really a very fun addition to the Love Hina mythos. It carried on quite nicely from where the series and specials left off. It has  everything those had in terms of humor, romance and the typical physical comedy, plus for the fanboys..plenty of wholesome fan service :o) I would highly recommend this to any fan of the Love Hina series and to those who haven't ever seen Love Hina, pick up the whole series and have some fun!",1065052800,,434,4.425
1904495,5,B0000AC8OJ,"Despite being totally different from the true ending of the manga, yet too similar to it, this is a valuable part of the series.
If anything, you should buy this just for the 30 second extra...  the ""Outtakes.""  It's just the dubber's way of poking fun at the series.  I think it was the best part of the whole DVD next to the actual show.  ^___^;;",1064707200,3,348,4.2272727272727275
1904496,5,B0000AC8OJ,"This is by far the 2nd best Love Hina dvd, the first one for me was the Christmas Movie (Silent Eve), you should buy this dvd, it's worth the money, I loved all 3 of the ending song version of 'Be For You, Be For Me"" the one thing I never really liked about the Love Hina dvds were the English track, the american voice actors cannot act, I hate the way they say each others name espically when they say 'Naru' everytime I listen to them, makes me want to scream really loud, the japanese voice seiyuu's are the best, Yui Horie can really sing ^-^ the dvd is like 93 minutes long, I think this dvd was really kawaii...So if you want to see how the Love Hina series end buy this dvd...",1063584000,,684,4.074074074074074
1904497,4,B0000AC8OJ,"I preordered mine the second I found out the American release date. I was sucked into the sweet romantic comedy back in the April of 2002 when a friend in California made me page layout with images from Love Hina. I promptly bought the first DVD I could find (which happened to be the second one, good thing too, since that episode devoted to Shinobu bugs the hell out of me) and have been an obsessed, die-hard fan ever since.
I was sadly dissappointed when I read a review stating Love Hina Again ends at Manga 12. I currently own up to Manga 13 (since the 14th and final manga is not on sale) and would highly recommend buying the Manga series if you haven't already. It truely does finalize Keitaro's and Naru's future plans better that the DVD. And unless they produce another DVD summing up the 13th and 14th manga, you miss a trully amazing (Though a bit sudden) ""Happy Toudai Wedding!""
The fanservice is more apparent and abound in nearly every scene, but it's nothing too extreme and not much worse that in the regular DVDs; my veiwing buddies included my younger sisters of 11 and 12 and nothing was too busty for me to cover their eyes, I personally found the Spring Special worse.
Anyways, happy veiwing!",1062892800,12,1216,4.506787330316742
1904498,5,B0000AC8OJ,"Yep! Rumors are true! ""Love Hina Again"" has finally maid it to English speaking manga funs!!!
Did you think that the series were over with ""Springs Special""?! Think again!!! Nothing is over! Enjoy this beautiful movie and get once more traped in the fascinating romance world of the ""Best Manga"" award winner of the year 2002, ""Love Hina""! See all girls again and get kicked, dumped and beaten to death by the ever advancing, shoking plot. Mr. Ken Akamatsu is really something isn't he! Don't you just love the romantic comedial charging that the series are tensed with? ...What...you are in love with Naru aren't, cha? or is it Ken's favorite Motoko? ^^
Continuing from where ""Springs Special"" left it the plot unfolds from the 70th Comic (9th book in the reprinted TokyoPop version)and is even cutter and funier than before!!!
This movie has by far the best translation in the dialogues and jokes don't loose the funny effect by being translated from Japanese beleive me I know (from Tokyo myself) ^__^
By far and wide ""Love Hina Again"" is the best and funniest DVD release of the series and perhaps the best DVD release of Japanese manga alltogether -finest colours I have ever seen! They are sure getting better aren't they? And with the 14th issue of the book just around the corner I am most impatient as to what we will see next!!!
See ya around,
your friend Chris",1062806400,3,1371,4.6929460580912865
1904499,3,B0000AC8OJ,"I am a huge fan of the series and i must say when i saw the fansubs of Love hina again i was dissapointed. it leaves you hanging just like the series did. and all the fanservice just kind of ruins it. i mean ya it was funny in the show but they pushed it to far for this OVA. if you really want to know what happens in this i suggest the manga, its great and this part of the story is told better and pluss its longer :P.",1061078400,2,421,3.688888888888889
1904500,5,B0000AC8OJ,"After the release of Love Hina Spring Movie by Bandai, there was some concern by some fans of whether or not we would be seeing a release of Love Hina Again any time soon.  Well, this is the answer we finally got.  This is the final 3 episode OVA that ends the anime version of the Love Hina story.  The story at this point is that this continues where the Spring Special left off.  Naru, Keitaro, and Mutsumi have finally made it into Tokyo U.  However, before Keitaro can begin his lifelong dream with Naru, a stroke of bad luck/accidents prevents Keitaro from attending the university.  After deciding to take a summer study abroad position with Seta, the issue of Naru's true feelings for Keitaro are put to the test, especially with the arrival of Keitaro's sister, Kanako, who apparently has a promise with her brother and ""loves"" him very much.  Add a legend about an old annex that binds two people together, which makes Naru's struggle with her feelings that much more difficult.  Will Naru open her heart to Keitaro or will she lose him forever?
This is another case where I had seen these last episodes in the original Japanese release.  These last episodes are very heavy with the ""fanservice"" compared to the TV series and specials.  Note: While the ending of the anime series with Love Hina Again is definitely a happy one, it's somewhat incomplete.  If you haven't read the manga version of Love Hina that Tokyopop is currently releasing, I highly recommend it, since it contains a more extensive storyline and the ""real"" ending which is much better and has a definite closure to it.
Also, keep an eye out for Bandai Ent. plans to release a special ""Movies"" collector's box/boxset which will hold/contain the X-mas, Spring, and LHA movies in Nov.",1058745600,32,1761,4.703583061889251
7996500,4,B0000AC8OJ,"This one is the last one of this series.  To bad they did not put it into a 2nd series instead of Movies. This one, Spring Movie and Christmas Movie should have been put together. For this movie was good. In term of story and artwork",1463356800,,233,4.065217391304348
7996501,4,B0000AC8OJ,spring movie is a little glitch it skips a little but other then that its awesome,1420675200,,81,4.125
7996502,3,B0000AC8OJ,"Like the rest of Love Hina it follows the romance between Keitaro and Naru. This story doesn't feel quite as refined as the original series and seems more like an attempt to keep their story going. However, it is still worth watching and has a lot of the same crazy, silly moments which are common among the series. If you like Love Hina you'll probably like this but not quite as much.",1386720000,,386,4.375
7996503,4,B0000AC8OJ,"Long awaited moment of loves confession. Love Hina fans will be delighted with the final out come of this series. Dreams, goals and confessions finally become a reality. Lots of great laughs, lots of tender moments, with an ending everyone will love. Add this final series to complete your collection and bring it to a happy closing. You will be glad you did if you are a Love Hina fan. For those who are looking for some good romance, some comedy and lots of heart felt moements....The Love Hina collection is for you. Keep in mind that this doesn't really have any eye candy in it. Watch Love Hina the series, Love Hina Christmas movie, Love Hina Spring movie and Love Hina Again for a satisfactory tale of loves trials.",1381104000,,722,4.561538461538461
7996504,5,B0000AC8OJ,"After his multiple failures Keitaro goes an a dig with Seta. While he is gone his sister shows up at the girls dorm and takes over, ruling with an iron fist. When Keitaro returns she begins her perverted plan to make him her lover. Yuck! What toll will this maniac take on Keitaro's relationship with the other girls, especially the one he truly loves?

This 3 episode special is the conclusion to the Love Hina series. It's as funny as the rest and stays true to the Love Hina style. If you like Love Hina then this movie will make you a happy camper.",1350777600,,552,4.3076923076923075
7996505,5,B0000AC8OJ,"How people say this isn't appropriate for children!! Ok so some of the girls fondle each other!  Oh my (in mock suprised voice) Thye are lesbians!! Well, people are, peo-ple.  Deat with it!!!  As much as small town Christians don't want to admit it!  And ok so some of teh girls appear in underwear!! Shocking!!!  NOT!! As if kids don't see that on tv anyway in adds for...underwear!!!  This is a great series and very charming and fun!  THe funniest part is when Keitaro opens the door of his sister's room (his step-sister, peo-ple) and Kanako is in her sexy underwear and has been trying to seduce him the whole time and each time Keitaro opens the door Kanako is in different sexy outfits and backgrounds!  Comedy genious!!
Good fun romantic series that I cant believe people say sis not for children!! Whatever!!!",1200614400,,818,4.671328671328672
7996506,5,B0000AC8OJ,"I've heard fans of the anime series Love Hina say this final movie was the worst piece of it.  I disagree.  For one thing, this is the only time in the series the art looks as good as in the manga.  In addition, the storyline is more faithful to this part of the manga storyline then the regular series ever was with its distracting added characters.  But my favorite thing about it is that it ends by perfectly recreating my favorite scene in the entire manga series, at the end of Volume 12.  Every panel from those last few pages is recreated faithfully here, and I couldn't be happier for that.  The series was an OK adaption of a superior manga, but Love Hina Again is far more satisfying in my opinion.",1178582400,,708,4.325757575757576
7996507,3,B0000AC8OJ,Definately not as good as the original series and only really worthwhile checking out if you are desperate to see some manga-esque lingerie.,1140739200,,140,5.130434782608695
7996508,5,B0000AC8OJ,"We've been watching the regular Love-Hina series, but we really loved the movies, especially this one. We love the crazyness, and the funny slapstick humor. Ok, so its not ""Miyazaki"" level anime, but what is? its just fun and mostly harmless. Plot wasn't bad, but (typically Love-Hina) its not deep either. I'd buy the other movies too. (haven't seen the Summer movie yet, nor the spring one) Just this one and the Xmas one - which was GREAT!!",1123891200,,443,4.6923076923076925
7996509,5,B0000AC8OJ,Although they changed the style of the characters it didn't really bother me. It starts with Keitaro entering Tokyo U with Naru and Mitsume. Little did Keitaro know that he was gonna break his leg because of Naru. A little after that Keitaro decides to go on a leave of absence with seta to explore the rest of the world in archeology. After about a year has passed his sister Kanako comes into the picture and claims that she is the owner of the Hinata Apartments. She does what ever she can to keep the others out of the annex. I won't exactly tell you the reason because that kinda ruins the ending. Anyways Keitaro comes back after the first episode and brings back gifts. Kanako seems to have a obsession with Keitaro and that just creeped me out. Other than that this movie was a great ending to the Love Hina series. This is a must buy if you have seen the rest of the Love Hina series!!!!,1115942400,,896,4.3076923076923075
