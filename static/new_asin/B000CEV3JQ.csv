8098567,1,B000CEV3JQ,"I rented this movie based on my love for Marcia Cross. Unfortunatly I couldn't even get through the whole of this movie. Even fast-fowarding, it was a waste of time. The storyline is slow and uneven, and Cross's acting is at her weakest.

It's about a photographer who falls for a fashion designer (Cross,) whose mother meddles. Cross's character spends the whole movie just questioning her relationship.",1180828800,5,404,5.029850746268656
