8759897,4,B01F05MPUM,"This lastest double feature release from Wild East Productions has Euro actor George Ardisson emoting as hero and villain in two rare Euro Westerns.  First up is Director Vincenzo Mussolini's (here billed as Glenn Vincent Davis) 'MAY GOD FORGIVE YOU...BUT I WON'T aka 'CHIEDI PERDONO A DIO ...NON A ME'- 1968, a good vengeance affair having Ardisson as the hero who's family is slaughtered and actor Anthony Ghidra who is normally the hero playing the villain who wants Ardisson's ranch land.  There are many good set pieces due to a tense script by the Director,  The only head scratcher is the music score by Felice De Stefano which seems during action sequences to utilize snippets from composer John Barry's 'Raid On Fort Knox' movement from Director Guy Hamilton's Bond classic 'GOLDFINGER'-1964 and is very annoying.  The highlight is the fight sequence between Ardisson and Ghidra which is worth the price of the disc.  Wild East includes a pre-credit Prologue and Epilogue which was cut from US prints as extras and allows the viewer to judge if they were assets in the first place.  English and Italian Trailers and a picture gallery are the additional extras. Up next is the first Western directed by the great Sergio Corbucci 'MASSACRE AT GRAND CANYON' -1963 and produced by US film maker Albert Band with Enzo Barboni on the Camera and Stelvio Massi on the editing.  Unfortunately, the affair emerges as a routine,extremely slow oater featuring US actors Jim Mitchum and Eduardo Ciannelli.  George Ardisson is back to what he does best in the villain department and a young Giacomo Rossi Stuart as the sheriff. The plot centers around two warring bandit groups going after land once again and Mitchum seeking vengeance on the outlaw who killed his father.  Some parts of the film seem to crawl but it does have a nice music score by Gianni Ferrio.  Corbucci would hit pay dirt three years later with ""DJANGO'-1966 and would become on of the great Euro Western Directors.  Band and Corbucci would team up again the same year with the great Joseph Cotton for the excellent 'THE HELLBENDERS' aka 'I CRUDELI'- 1966. The film has English and Italian trailers as extras.  The packages true highlight is a great interview with George Ardisson taken before his death in 2014.  Lasting over 20 minutes, he has great stories about 'MAY GOD FORGIVE' which was one of his favorites but his voice suffers from losing a lung due to a tumor removal.  It emerges as a great tribute and memorial to his art and a wonderful conclusion to this mixed bag of Westerns.",1497744000,,2559,4.839449541284404
