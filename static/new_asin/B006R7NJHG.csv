5014592,5,B006R7NJHG,"By now if you're a Maiden fan, you know they like to treat their fans to a new compilation or live album every once in a while. So here we have En Vivo: Live At Estadio Nacinal, Santiago. Filmed in front of 50,000 Chilean fans, even before purchasing this concert, I knew it would be great. There's something about the South American fans and the concerts held there that are just phenomenal, previous proof is in the now classic Rock In Rio show. So, how does this show hold up to the other Maiden live releases?

Excellent. From the setlist of the new songs, the performances of them, the new stage and Eddie, this concert and band are on full throttle. The band is amazingly prowess and in great form executing the songs. The show opener is great, the crowd is absolutely fantastic, singing right along to the brand new title-track. Bruce can amazingly still hit those highs, check out The Talisman, which happens to be one of my personal favs off the Final Frontier. Even though there are usual suspects played again and again and again, the band still finds a way to breath new life in them some way, some how.

Now on the DVD/Blu-ray visual and audio, both are fantastic. The split screen shots of the concert really do justice to the huge band Maiden have now become, and the producers of the film really did a great job editing and shooting them. The audio is crisp and the mix sounds great. The bonus 'Behind The Beast' documentary is very, very insightful on the band's Final Frontier world tour. You really learn how much work and stress is put in to making these concerts just right every night. Also included is the promo video for the Final Frontier and a mini-doc on how it was made. Overall, this is great addition to any Maiden fan's library, and if you attended any part of this tour, a great momento of this incredible band at what they do best.

Now on a final side note, I am still anticipating on the History of Iron Maiden part 3 as many other fans might be. Here's hoping they will continue the series, and possibly record this years Maiden England throw-back tour, and include it on there? But for now, this concert should hold us fans over. Up The Irons!",1332892800,3,2180,4.472361809045226
5014593,1,B006R7NJHG,"Maiden have probably reached the peak of what is unbearably self-aggrandizing behaviour. At this point it's really about letting you know they're a big popular band. From the start there's the shots of the usual fans who will shout you down telling you that ""OMFG MIADINE BEASZT EVAER!! FLACK OFF!!!!"" with an over produced and numbingly senseless montage of some sci-fi sort set to Satellite 26. The music from Final Frontier was about the most pointless of their career but that doesn't matter when there's a great show to put on. It's not about the music. Throw in the comic relief elements of Janick and Nicko and you have the best entertainment a candy floss bearing kid could have. To see Janick doing pirouette after pirouette in close shot HD, and a midget singer doing split leaps and just managing to avoid soiling his pants on the not really high notes is worth the price of this disc and more. Maiden has everything Steve and Rod wanted, status, fan numbers, money, mock prog rock music. If you look at Maiden's real picture of Dorian Gray, you'll see a Fat Elvis, about to keel over on the toilet. This video is really the most shallow garbage released by Maiden and a step down even from the previous videos of the last decade. The split screens are like a tv show preview, just worsening the whole effect. It's like heaven for those who are faithful to a brand and have no brains or taste.

EDIT: Once again for those Maiden fans who are either too thin skinned or never liked education, a review is not meant to be complimentary at all costs. So if this product has been rated negatively, the correct place to complain about people that 'hate Maiden' is right there on the Maiden website. This is a place INTENDED FOR REVIEWS, OPINIONS INCLUDING NEGATIVE ONES. If you don't like it, send Steve Harris a tear stained note about how this review made you unhappy and spoilt your holiday/week/life, along with a $60 fanclub membership fee.

5014594,5,B006R7NJHG,"I've been seeing some rather poor reviews on this new Maiden title on several other sights.  I myself just picked up the Blu-Ray & C.D. and I must say, Go Maiden!!!  See, I caught this show when they past through Phoenix and yes, it's not really my favorite when it comes to their song line up.  However, this is the band that has never quit!!!  I'm in my 40's now and I've been a fan since 15 years old.  I've seen the good times, the bad times, and the forever changing times, yet here's MAIDEN!!!  Never quit when the going got rough and never charged me an arm and a leg just to get up by the front of the stage to get a closer view.  Not sure if everyone's up on the ticket prices these bands that quit then ""re-start"" back up years down the road are charging...  It's a crime and I don't get suckered into it ever!!! Iron Maiden's not charging those silly prices and I keep coming back for more.  So Iron Maiden comes out with something new with the ""ASAP"" attitude which their known for as of late, and it's not always a 10 star attempt.  Who cares, love it cuz they love it!!!  Roll with it cuz that's what they've always done for us!!!  Keep up the great work Maiden.  UP THE IRONS!!!",1332806400,3,1193,4.157205240174672
5014595,5,B006R7NJHG,"Maiden is the best band that ever existed! Let there be no doubt. There will never be another band like this. The artists and their music is legendary. So of course I pre-ordered this sucker, and saw it over the weekend.

I love the fact that they release a lot of live dvds and albums these days, 'cause like it or not they're not getting younger. And it's great that the fans get to build a large archive we can enjoy long after the boys have retired. I would rather have seen them release more studio-albums with new music though, but as long as something is happening in the Maiden camp I'm happy.

The documentary:
I think it's an awesome documentary, and makes you realize just how much work they put into their tours. It's quite insane, actually! I had no clue that the crew put SO much work into it!

The concert:
As a die-hard Maiden fan who has seen everything they ever released hundreds of times, I think this is very good but maybe not the best. Waaay better than ""Dance on the road"" and ""Live at Donington '92"", but not as good as ""Flight 666"", ""Beast over Hammersmith"" and ""Rock In Rio"".

It captures exactly what you get when you go to a modern Maiden show. I personally like the split-screen editing, 'cause it gives you even more the feeling of confusion you get at a real concert, where you constantly change focus between the backdrops, the effects and the people on stage.

I personally think that the new songs are most interesting to see/hear. The ones that have never been played before. They sound exactly like they do on the album, and work even better live. The classics from the 80's... it's not the band's fault they are getting older, but the actual band doesn't really look as good/cool now as they did back in the days (except Steve Harris). And that kind of makes me wanna skip the classics on this one, and watch the ""Live After Death"" video instead. But the classics need to be there, basically because that's what the average Maiden-fan wants, so I won't complaint about it.

The performance:
I might be over-critical, but I feel they are getting a little sloppy again. Like they were when they released ""A Real Live/Dead One"". I think it lacks the focus and perfection they had on ""Rock in Rio"" and ""Beast over Hammersmith"", which almost have studio quality playing. The guitars on this are just a wall of sound, and you basically don't hear what the guitars are playing, except on the solos. And I think the solos are a little sloppy too. It honestly sounds really messy at times. I did, for example, not recognize ""2 minutes to midnight"" until the riff had been played a couple of times. And this is a song that I've heard billions of times.

The sound:
I have to admit that I'm getting a little tired of them using the same sound/production on everything they release. In the 80's, they changed their sound between every tour, but now it's getting pretty predictable. And that makes it even more tempting to skip songs like ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"", ""Iron Maiden"", and ""Fear of the dark"". Because you've heard it all before. More or less.

They need to be there and they are perfect songs on an actual concert, 'cause then you sing along and just enjoy yourself, but it's REALLY boring to see at home. Unless you're a new fan, of course.

All in all, another excellent release that gives us 5 new songs (The Final Frontier, El Dorado, The Talisman, Coming Home and When The Wild Wind Blows) and a cool new documentary. Keep 'em coming!",1332806400,10,3473,4.5
5014596,5,B006R7NJHG,"Iron Maiden have been the undisputed kings of metal since they hit big in the 1980s, and have enjoyed a lengthy and successful career that continues to attract more fans with every turning day, and play to sold out stadiums, arenas, and amphitheaters worldwide- all without the help of mainstream attention. And in 2010, the band embarked in a rehearsal leg for the Final Frontier Tour, only to return to the stage in 2011 for a full scale, cutting edge tour, playing to several countries in several countries worldwide! And En Vivo! is a depiction of one of these spectacular shows, which shows us that even after 36 years, Maiden still rule the music world with an iron fist!

This blu-ray really does showcase Maiden at their best. Even more amazing show is that Maiden play to a sold out crowd of 50,000 (or so Bruce says) in a large stadium setting, with a setlist based on NEW material, with a few classics thrown in there for good measure. The fans go WILD with every tune and the band's energy is just unbelievable, considering how old they are.

The band are in top shape, folks. Bruce brings back the mic stand for the first time since 1999, but even that doesn't stop him from giving it his all here. He still runs around the stage like a hyperactive 12 year old, and, which must have had men in the audience his age reminding themselves to hit the gym. And boy, he can hit the notes better than ever! The Talisman had me wowed, and was an indicator of the amazingness to come. Adrian improvises a bit here, and it sounds damn good. And Steve, Dave and Jan? Well, amazing as aways, I can always expect the best from my favourite band knowing I'm going to get nothing but the best :) and I'm beginning to think Nicko is an alien or something. That must be the only explanation for his being able to drum that inhumanly amazing!

I was taken a bit aback when I found out that it was shot on 22 cameras, but have no worry here, the fast edits found on DOTR and RIR are nowhere to be found. Instead, we get split screens, and that manages to make the show feel more intimate as a result. We get to see Dave play a solo! And we get to see different things at once. None of the split screens are distracting and it feels like you can actually see everything for longer than 3 seconds.

The video quality? Absolutely superb!!! No grain to be seen at all. Shot with 22 RED cameras, the cinematography looks incredible and you can see every pore on Bruce's face, every detail of the guitars, etc. You feel like you're there At the ery front. And the HD mix? Well, it's like you're at the barrier. Just incredible.

The special features are very sparse. There's an 88 minute documentary called Behind The Beast, which I'm saving for the weekend. There's the Satellite 15... The Final Frontier video, there's a making of featurette, and the intro video for the tour.

Simply put, this is a MUST for any Maiden fan. Maiden have never been this amazing, and I cannot wait to see them a third time on July 27th! Ive only 3 more words to say:

UP THE IRONS!!!!!!",1332720000,20,3058,4.392226148409894
5014597,5,B006R7NJHG,"It was an amazing show of Iron Maiden, I was there listening and screaming with the 50.000. In 2008 the ""Estadio Nacional"" was closed for reapiring, and Bruce told that Iron Maiden will come back to play at the Stadium... Iron Maiden delivered and with a great news, the will film the show. Do you know that Iron Maiden film the show in Buenos Aires Argentina and Santiago Chile? well.. now you can see that the Chilean show was the best and with the best audience.",1332720000,5,465,4.4186046511627906
5014598,4,B006R7NJHG,"Well, like the title says. I mean, its Iron Maiden and they are always playing the same stuff live so you would probably think that you didn't need to buy this. But in fact, this one is a bit different since its almost only songs from Brave New World (2000) to The Final Frontier 2010.

I like this setlist since I'm a bit tired of the old songs that are played over and over again. Dont get me wrong, I'm a die hard Maiden fan and love their old stuff, but I do also love their new stuff and would like to hear more new songs live. En Vivo deliver just that, and the band is as always in great shape.

En Vivo is much better than last one, and Death On The Road. I think the only thing I would complain about if I should is that they have some weird camera angels where they cut the picture in two, filming Janick Gers to the left and Nicko Mcbrain to the right of the screen for example. Now I don't have much problem with that, but it gets too much on this DVD.

Great live performance, and if you are into Maiden - Dont miss out on this.",1332460800,26,1041,3.971291866028708

5014643,5,B006R7NJHG,"I have become a 'new' Maiden fan recently.  I used to dislike the prog rock songs Maiden would make way back when.  I always liked the straight ahead rockers more.  Recently, that has begun to change.  I like the stuff from Brave New World and onward.  I don't know what changed for me, but I enjoy it.
In regards to this DVD, if you like the newer Maiden this is a good show.  I don't find the split screen as annoying as other reviewers.  I think it makes the DVD more enjoyable to watch more than once.  Each time I see something I didn't see before due to the split screens.  I think the sound quality and mixing is excellent.
The second disc is enjoyable.  Behind the Beast is fun to watch if you liked the Flight 666 thing.  I enjoyed the making of the video piece as well.  All in all, buy if you like newer Maiden.  If not, maybe this would be a good introduction.",1379894400,,872,4.149700598802395

Others come and go, but Maiden has been true to their music, their fans and all of this has played into their longevity.  In their hey-day, they never broke the top 10 selling albums in the USA.  They have done so more than once since 2000.  That speaks to their ability to reign in new fans and keep their loyal fans happy.  Staying true to their music and fans for over 30 years.  Who else has done that?  No one!  Well, Megadeth has-->thanks Dave.  Nevertheless, 30+ years.  That's impressive by any musical standard.  Up the Irons!",1368576000,,667,4.475

5014655,3,B006R7NJHG,"Obviously this is a well produced piece of audio, as for the video, Iron Maiden has decided to go along with the newer trends in movie/video editing and cater to the ADHD demographic. The tour is also from an album that has some excellent songs, some ok songs, and a few duds. My favorite tracks from The Final Frontier are Starblind, Talisman, Alchemist, Mother of Mercy, & Isles of Avalon, only one of which I even get to hear live. The opening track is ok, Eldorado is a notch above ok, and when the wild wind blows definitely has its moments, but overall, very disappointing because after the new tracks, all you have is the same old stuff, most of which I can dig out much better live versions of. I guess my main complaint is Iron Maiden's inability to whip out more new material or at least the rare gem that hasn't been played in forever. Still Life maybe? Flight of Icarus? Invaders?...hell that one has never been done live as far as I know. I'd even settle for Sign of the Cross. Com'on Maiden, let's think outside the box a bit here. The coolest thing they've done in recent memory was play the entire Matter of Life & Death album front to back. The album is a bit of a mixed bag, but I liked it, and playing the whole thing was a nice middle finger to all the has-been fans who come out to hear the Trooper.

For me, as a huge fan, when they put out some new live stuff, if there are some kick-a$$ tracks on the new album, then play that s***! I'd love to have a good live version of Starblind. That song is bad-a$$!

Anyway, good audio, good show, nice video production minus the seizures and ADHD format, but I'm sick of the same old stuff. The best version of Fear of the Dark has already been done. At least throw us fans a few more rare treats.",1360540800,2,1762,4.241071428571429

The video is well shot and crystal clear! The sound quality is also top notch, especially considering this is a live show of one of (if not THE) loudest bands in the world playing to a stadium sized audience! As to the band themselves, they haven't lost a step over their long careers, neither has Eddie - no matter what happened to him over the years. Maiden is still pin-point accurate in their playing and enthusiastic in their performances! How they can maintain this kind of energy after all these years is beyond me! Then again, no band is going to make a concert DVD from an off night - LOL!

My only complaint is that Dave Murray's guitar wasn't very loud at all.  I'm not sure if it was an oversight during the mix or a problem with my stereo system but it's definitely annoying.

5014685,5,B006R7NJHG,"This is a solid performance from one of the most important hard rock bands in history. Though in their mid-late 50's, they still get it done. Smith and Murray can still shred. It is impressive to say the least. Bruce is still a solid front man, Nicko still plays barefoot, and Steve Harris still mouths the lyrics. If you have Live After Death on video then you know what Maiden looked like in their prime. They may jump around a little less, look a little older, and not wear spandex these days but musically they are just as strong as ever. The new songs in this concert are solid Maiden tunes. Due to the time, they will never replicate another 2 Minutes to Midnight or The Trooper, but that doesn't mean the new stuff isn't as good. Sadly, it's just not in style these days like it was in the 80's.

If you're a true Maiden fan, you will not be disappointed. Get this.",1335052800,,872,4.317073170731708

5014687,3,B006R7NJHG,"I will not comment on Iron Maiden. It is one of the five most influential and important bands in the history of Heavy Metal (Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, AC/DC and Metallica are the other 4). But the band just gave up innovation. Opted to follow the path of repetition.

Iron Maiden released four DVDs in recent years: Rock in Rio, Death in the Road, Flight 666 and this En Vivo. On average, each DVD has about 17 songs. Nearly half of them are the same in the 4 DVDs...Trooper, 2 Minutes, Fear of Dark, Hallowed, IM, Number, Hills ... Do they not get tired of playing always the same thing? Do they not realise that we get tired to watch a ""new"" DVD with the same set list every time?

Today's technology allows 20 cameras to take over the stage, shooting from all possible angles with zooms, details, etc... But in the editing they do not need to show everything that 20 cameras filmed all the time.

In fact we can not see the show. We can not really see any musician playing. They switch from one image to another every 2 seconds. Seriously. This irritated me so much that I started to count...at every 2 seconds the image changes. I like to see the musicians playing. The camera has to stop in the guy to show his hand doing gymnastics, raining fingers on the fretboard. But the scene switches from the guitar solo to Nicko's knee then to the audience screaming, then to Dickinson jumping and going to the Gers pirouetting...and solo is finished.

Another very annoying point... the screen splits to show 2 or 3 pictures .... look, it is already hard to see an image every 2 seconds, imagine a screen with 3 frames! Like Dickinson singing from two different angles which alternates with the aerial view of the stadium while Harris plays bass and Gers kicks the air.... all in the same scene....and you have only 2 seconds to see it.

Final comment: the band's performance is exactly the same as always. Dickinson runs the whole stage, leaps, jumps and tries to behave like an adolescent from the audience. And the three guitarists in the band ... It's impossible to believe that they are working hard...they play the same music every night...but they show faces like those riffs were demanding a lot of dedication...Murray plays a chord and raises arm. Lack naturalness in presentation, the show is exactly the same rehearsed for so long. The same as any of the previous DVDs. I am sorry Iron Maiden...I am a fan of the band...but it's a shame.",1334620800,8,2449,4.556818181818182
5014688,4,B006R7NJHG,"I appreciate Iron Maiden releasing this concert video because when I went to the first show of this tour in Dallas, I witnessed the live debut of ""El Dorado"" and an average at best song list that contained no classics until the last four songs (the same on this set).  ""The Final Frontier"" is Maiden's best album in a long time, and their live selections from it are good, but one of the top two songs ""Isle of Avalon"" is strangely missing.  The video and sound quality are excellent just like the ""Flight"" Blu-ray.  There are a lot of split/multi-screen shots which offer a unique perspective.  The only drawbacks:  ""Dance of Death"" - never got into it, it's a mediocre regurgitation of ""Number of the Beast""; I loathe Janick Gers and his buffoonery, stage antics, posturing, and butchering of Adrian Smith's solos.  I give credit for the band as a whole to put out another good concert video with an enthusiastic audience.  Additionally, they again add some nice extras including an interesting documentary to complete a solid package.  Maiden has always done a good job in catering to its fans...albeit a few too many ""best hits"" albums.  I have been watching their videos for 25 years and highly recommend this one for Iron Maiden fans.",1333929600,,1240,4.730232558139535
5014689,5,B006R7NJHG,"I must warn the reader that I may not be objective reviewing this product. Because I'm a Maiden fan since their early years and I always tend to rate their products with five stars. (Yes even their albums from the 1990's; many people believe those albums are weak in Maiden standarts).

I live in Turkey and En Vivo DVD was released a few days late here. At the meantime, I -as many Maiden fans did - watched the songs in You Tube. But yet, I purchased the Limited Edition Steel Box. I believe many Maiden fans did the same.

In 2011, when the Final Frontier album was announced, it was scary for two reasons: There was a resemblance with Pink Floyd's The Final Cut album. First, both albums included the word ""final"" in their title and second both albums included a song about a nuclear holocaust. (Two Suns in the Sunset in The Final Cut and When the Wild Wind Blows in The Final Frontier.) Some commentators claimed that The Final Frontier would be the last album in Maiden's career. But soon after the album was released, Maiden announced a World Tour called The Final Frontier Tour. It was a great chance for me to watch them live in the Sonisphere leg of the tour in Istanbul/Turkey. It was the best show I've ever seen so far.

En Vivo was recorded in Santiago/Chile with the same list of songs. So, nothing new for those who watched Iron Maiden live in their World Tour. So what makes this DVD special?

Let's review one by one:

1. Nice album cover + booklet: I don't like seeing Eddie (Maiden's famous mascot) so disgusting in the album covers. My Favourite Eddie's are those in the Piece of Mind, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, Somewhere in Time and A Matter of Life and Death album covers. In En Vivo's cover, we see Eddie with his huge teeth and small eyes at the upper half and Maiden on the stage at the lower half. Amazing Chilean fans are at the background. There's an 8 page booklet in the DVD, including the info about The Final Frontier World Tour, band members, special thanks, the ""Killer Crew"", etc, plus pictures from the show and that disgusting Eddie again.

2. First DVD (Concert) : Then the show begins with an empty view of the Estadio Nacional Stadium of Santiago. Then the Ed Force airplane flows over the stadium and a lovely Latin lady screaming ""Maideeeeen"". Then comes the screen divided to three. We watch pieces from the Final Frontier clip, band members landing on Chile and the Maiden fans - always so hot and amazing, they are the best parts of the Maiden shows. Finally, the stadium is full and Bruce Dickinson's digital view appears, singing the first lines of The Final Frontier song. (Stars at the background) This is a very exciting start for the show. After the opening, the live show begins and from the very begining of the concert, you feel the taste of a great Rock band.

The song selection may be discussed. Many Maiden fans would like to hear the songs such as Aces High, Run to the Hills, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner from the earlier period or songs such as Isle of Avalon, Starblind from The Final Frontier album. But, hey guys ! Remember, Iron Maiden can organize a concert and play all the songs available in their career and yet, Maiden fans would demand more and more. If I should criticize En Vivo DVD, it would be that: Why there's no song from A Matter of Life and Death album? (I think it's one of the best albums in Maiden's career.)

My favourite songs from En Vivo album are The Talisman, Dance of Death, Blood Brothers, When the Wild Wind Blows, Fear of the Dark and Hallowed Be Thy Name. I don't mean the other songs are performed bad. But I think, Maiden performance is at the height, especially in Talisman, Dance of Death and Fear of the Dark. Bruce Dickinson is more than a singer; almost an actor. Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Jannick Gers are perfect. Nicko is Nicko (any comment needed?) and Steve Harris is unbelievable. I am younger than all the members of the band and I can't believe how energetic they are, at the stage.

A walking Eddie appears in The Evil That Men Do. Then a giant Eddie appears behind the stage in the song Iron maiden, again. The last song is from the ""Jurassic Park Period"" of the band: Running Free. I think it was funny to close the show with that song. At least Maiden fans have hope now that Maiden will not disband and make new albums. (""2012 - Maiden England"" tour was already announced.)

3. Second DVD (Behind the Beast) : As the name implies, this DVD is about the behind of the stage. I'm sure Maiden fans would like to see how that excellent show was planned from the very beginning in full details.

Finally ... We always ask ourselves: Why should I buy this product? My answer for En vivo is simple: This is the height in Maiden's carreer. If you're a Rocker, you have to own this DVD. Iron Maiden products are always worth of buying, and this is the best so far.",1333843200,,4882,4.431438127090301
5014690,5,B006R7NJHG,After 9 years Maiden is and always be my fav band. couldn't wait to get this dvd. though the tin was dented when i opened it oh well its still amazing. I love it,1333584000,,161,3.764705882352941
5014691,5,B006R7NJHG,"I've only watched a couple of songs so far, but I watched the tour documentary all the way through. That, alone, is worth the price of the DVD. It's VERY well done. (Iron Maiden does a better job with each release. They give their fans their all!) Seeing how much ingenuity and hard work goes into pulling off their tours is intriguing, entertaining and inspiring. It seems like a wonderful ""place"" to work. And like the last DVD, it's amazing to see such a loyal fan base so many varied cultures. It's like The Amazing Race of heavy metal!

I look forward to watching the concert, as what I saw so far was hard to stop watching (but I had work in the morning). The sound couldn't be any better. I think it's better than the last DVD, which wasn't anything to complain about. Bruce especially sounded great. And the picture and shots look stunning.

It's not hard to see why this is a top seller.",1333497600,2,896,4.391566265060241
5014692,3,B006R7NJHG,"This looks and sounds great, right up until before ""Number of the Beast,"" the first encore. Has anyone else noticed the 2-second (or 3-second delay) between audio and video that starts when the band begins ""Number of the Beast""? The visuals are a good two or three seconds behind the audio. Has anyone else's copy done this?",1333411200,,324,4.701754385964913
5014693,5,B006R7NJHG,"My boyfriend and I went to the Final Frontier concert in April 2011 and loved it!  The Blu-Ray concert version was just as amazing as watching it live (also having a good sound system helps too).  One of the bonus features we really enjoyed was of the band's behind the scenes globe-trekking experience---they go into detail about Ed Force One as well as the craziness they experience with production setup from country-to-country.

Overall, my boyfriend (a HUGE Iron Maiden fan) and I were highly impressed with the Blu-Ray.",1333324800,,525,4.943181818181818
5014694,3,B006R7NJHG,"I just turned off the TV and I'm currently listening to this Blu-ray with HD Audio 5.1, and ALL IS GOOD once again. Gotta love Maiden. New stuff, classics, its all the same formulaic stuff. But as I've preached many times, when it comes to Iron Maiden, you either GET IT or you don't. I developed my guitar chops on early Maiden tunes, so I've been a fan since day one. I buy every new release, unheard and unseen, and pretty much hope for the best.
Unfortunately, as I stated in the title, I can't watch this Blu-ray! Way too frantic and UNEDITED. Split screen galore, and not the good kind, where it holds and you can watch several camera angles, your choice. No, when it split screens you get the split image (2, 3 or 4 different frames) for about half a second. Then its off to the next screen. Do we really need to see every angle, every moment? The job of a GOOD EDITOR is to DECIDE what to show and for how long. Direct our focus and then KEEP it THERE for a few breaths at least. During guitar solos, just one camera on the guitar player please. -is this not simple common sense for a rock/metal oriented recording?
I realize this is an issue with many concert Blu-rays. This is not the first BD with frantic and hyper-speed, music video type editing. But it may just be the WORST I've ever seen. So Beware!
So my tip, turn off the TV, crank up the volume. With Maiden, its about the music anyway which deserves 5 stars, the watch-ability factor get 1-star. Overall 3 stars.
(Final Note: any Iron Maiden fans who have never heard Bruce Dickinson's Chemical Wedding album, should buy it immediately. It's what an Iron Maiden effort COULD SOUND like with a little musical/metal evolution, and hands-down RIVALS any Iron Maiden album in the last decade. Give it a spin.)",1333324800,33,1775,4.431192660550459
5014695,5,B006R7NJHG,"Iron Maiden fans don't really care what someone might write here. They are fully aware of the fact that Iron Maiden is the greatest rock band in the world and already have this Blu-Ray as well as the CD (and the vinyl is on order).

So I'm writing this for those who don't know as much about Iron Maiden. Watch this - as well as Flight 666 - and all will be revealed to you. Both films include excellent recent concert footage as well as superb behind the scenes documentary footage. Both movies are surprisingly engaging and are done with exceptional care and quality.

Most who watch these movies will see band members they will actually like, admire, and relate to - regular (but extremely accomplished) guys in a not so regular profession.

Even fans that have heard some of this material many times, own Flight 666, and have seen them live hundreds of times, will still marvel at the quality of En Vivo!  And when they are finished with the concert footage they will still have the all new documentary footage to look forward to  - footage that's worth the price all by itself.

Truly, this is as good as it gets.",1333324800,2,1118,4.482758620689655
5014696,5,B006R7NJHG,"I am not going to spend too much time on the review of this Blu-ray, that has been done professionally and met with positive reaction (Metal Hammer 8/10,  Kerrang! 4/5, Allmusic 3.5/5 and Classic Rock was the most critical with 6/10).

That being said, personally, I liked the split screens. Every now and then it gets a little too much, but it really helps overall, as picture doesn't change every second or two like previous releases and it flows more naturally. I also enjoyed the sound, I think it's a little better than Flight 666, the base stands out more and gives more depth to the concert. Obviously the quality of the video is superb. Someone said here that it was filmed with RED cameras (which are top of the line cameras that were basically used for every single movie in the past few years). I don't know if that's 100% true, but nevertheless, it is in HD. The only thing about video is that sometimes Bruce's face is a little overexposed, obviously due to spotlights being aimed at him, but it's not too distracting.

I saw them on this tour live and I was really looking forward to this release. I have seen their old stuff and although their 80s work is one of the most influential and highly acclaimed in the metal community, I really enjoy their new songs as well. What was very interesting is the documentary. It really gave an in-depth look into how everything is brought together. I probably liked it more than Flight 666 documentary.

They are the same band as they were before, because they play for themselves. Going back to Live After Death, Bruce was always jumping like there is no tomorrow and Steve would run across the stage. Nicko was always a funny man out of all of them always making faces. Adrian and Dave, for the most part, were always standing next to each other on the left side of the stage. The only addition was Janick, which, again, didn't change either from their early 90 releases.

I think the documentary really shows how they feel about what they do. They didn't fall apart years ago and blew their money off and then started reunion tours to get some quick cash. They've been around since 1975, and they are not going anywhere. They play more countries, bigger stadiums and their albums are hit after hit. Just look at their albums in the past 10 years, it's been steadily moving up in charts with their last release reaching nearly No. 1 spot all over the globe.",1333238400,9,2413,4.537931034482758
5014697,5,B006R7NJHG,"My biggest fear when waiting for the Blu Ray to arrive was how the concert would view during the split screen shots. I must say that my fears were unfounded, if anything they add more to the viewing experience because the viewer can see more of whats happening on stage at a certain time. The sound and picture quality are excellent and the crowd is of course fanatical (if only the US crowds could be like that). The set list is of course a matter of opinion, but in my view the disc really takes off AFTER Two Minutes to Midnight. Dance Of Death and The Wicker Man are incredible and Where the Wild Wind Blows is much heavier live than on CD. Adrian adds a little more flair on some of the songs than on the original recordings but this just adds to the concert experience. Some reviewers will complain that to many of the same old Maiden songs are on this disc, but in a concert setting all of these songs take on a new life. After all you are watching a moment in time preserved. Hope to see you on the 2012 tour!!!!!!",1332979200,3,1022,4.219387755102041
5014698,5,B006R7NJHG,"This is really good footage of the latest Maiden tour.  I like that they played more songs off then new album since we did not get to see them last US tour.  Bruce sounds really good on this one.  Also, while there is split screen coverage it's done well.  Sam Dunn and the Banger films crew has done another excellent job.

The Behind the Beast documentary would be worth the purchase alone.  The quality of the documentary is much better than what I expected and clocks in at around 1.5 hours.  It's more in depth than Flight 666 about what goes on behind Ed Force 1.

Strongly recommend for Maiden and concert film fans.",1332979200,2,623,4.4035087719298245
