8012453,4,B0001GWBIM,"Not what I expected. Especially after having watched the movie first. The animation leaves a lot to be desired, but the comedy is funny. And it's PG rated Eddie Griffin during the intermission of each episode. I enjoyed it more the 2nd time I watched it. As many of the nuances hit home.",1399420800,,287,4.433962264150943
8012454,1,B0001GWBIM,"The version on sale was not clearly designated as the cartoon version v. the actual movie.  Perhaps with some additional research on my part, I could have figured it out, but it wasn't clear at the original screen.",1294099200,,214,4.631578947368421
8012455,3,B0001GWBIM,"Here are 12 internet cartoons that may have inspired the film.  Eddie Griffin introduces each clip.  I wonder if this influenced ""The Simpsons"" episode where Bart drew ""Angry Dad.""  The shorts are so small that Eddie Griffin's introductions are almost as long.  This is cheap animation where only one person or object moves at a time.  It may remind you of ""Spiderman"" or other cartoons made in the late 1960s.  Its biting racial commentary may remind some of David Chappelle's Show.  This film takes shots at many real people such as Jim Brown, Alan Keyes, and Whitney Houston.  It tries to balance things by making fun of itself: cracking jokes about BET and Eddie Griffin.  If you liked ""L'il Pimp"" or the actual ""Undercover"" film, you might as well see this.",1154736000,,762,4.755725190839694
