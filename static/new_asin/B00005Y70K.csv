7956915,1,B00005Y70K,"Someone should refund the $1000 it took to make this movie because they wasted their money.  Terrible acting, terrible script. terrible sets....don't waste your money on straight actors who attempt to play lesbian parts.",1438387200,,220,5.470588235294118
7956916,3,B00005Y70K,I rated it as its okay because it was to short and more romance would be nice. The type of movie made me lose a little interest also. The type of movie i ment by is how it was made.,1368144000,,181,3.55
7956917,4,B00005Y70K,"Was another good movie to add to my collection.  The storyline wasn't as good as in some other movies, but was worth watching.",1362528000,,126,4.478260869565218
7956918,2,B00005Y70K,"""An Intimate Friendship"" is a ""G"" rated film suitable for heterosexuals.  The main thrust of this film is the ""coming out"" of a young woman to her best friend and sister.  Lots of tangled relationships with over dialog and bad transitions.  A low budget Lesbian film.  I had to wait 58 minutes for the first Lesbian encounter.  Not like I expected a porno flick...but please....arouse me!  The film has a good twist if you're willing to wait for the end of the movie.  Not a great movie if you're looking for a lot of Lesbian bedroom scenes.  This one isn't it.  You want hot steamy sex....buy ""Bound"" or ""Therese and Isabelle.""  Both are available on DVD on this website.",1035590400,19,672,4.571428571428571
