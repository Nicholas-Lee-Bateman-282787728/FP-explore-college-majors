2658003,5,B000IJ7AGK,"Both of these films have been in the ""public domain"" for a while, and really lousy video & DVD transfers have inundated the shelves, cheap quickies with poor picture & scratchy sound. Both films are classics, and deserve a treatment as good as this (if not better). I enjoy  ""And Then There Were None"" maybe a little more. The very stylish director, Rene Clair, assembled a cast of reliable ""supporting"" players, including Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Judith Anderson, Roland Young, etc., and they are in confident command of the wonderful Agatha Christie material. ""The Most Dangerous Game"" is also terrific; at only an hour long, it is suspenseful and the entire cast is marvelous (Joel McCrea, Fay Wray, Leslie Banks, Robert Anderson). You could do a lot worse than to purchase this fine duo by Marengo Films.",1164153600,37,816,4.956204379562044
2658007,4,B000IJ7AGK,"These are both good adaptations of the original stories. Slight changes and additions in characters, but as I used this after reading the originals with my students, it made for great discussions.",1460851200,,196,5.15625

2658010,4,B000IJ7AGK,I have watched both movies.  Great viewing.  Especially liked And Then There Was None.,1433808000,,86,5.071428571428571
2658011,4,B000IJ7AGK,"This is my favorite of all of Agatha's stories.  Very suspenseful and atmospheric.
The other feature is representative of the cruelty of hunting.  Especially defenseless creatures.",1432339200,,180,5.884615384615385

2658013,1,B000IJ7AGK,Disappointing interpretation of Agatha Christie's masterpiece. DVD viewing quality also a disappointment.,1427328000,,105,7.833333333333333
2658014,5,B000IJ7AGK,"This was a great bargain--two of my favorite classic films in one low-priced package. THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (1932) is an exciting adventure from the makers of KING KONG with the same female lead (Fay Wray). She and Joel McCrea must escape from a madman on a remote island. AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (1945) is Rene CLair's all-star film version of the famous Agatha Christie play. Ten strangers (including Walter Huston, Barry Fitzgerald, June Duprez, Judith Anderson, and Louis Hayward) are brought to a remote island and killed off one-by-one.

The prints are decent and the sound is fairly clear, considering the age of the films themselves. There are better DVDs of both titles available, but this one is perfectly good. Two must-see movies for mystery and thriller fans. Highly Recommended.",1423008000,5,795,5.0227272727272725
2658015,4,B000IJ7AGK,"I'm a teacher, used for added support for reading, comprehension essay lesson for lower level,students. The map is not easy to draw. Was challenging for general Ed  9th graders. Had to take textual evidence to support map.",1404086400,,222,5.0
2658016,2,B000IJ7AGK,"The Most Dangerous Game was generally a story that students tended to enjoy but this movie was a terrible, feeble attempt that was a total waste of our time.",1389398400,,157,4.448275862068965
2658042,5,B000IJ7AGK,"I suppose that reviews of a DVD of old movies should consider two aspects; the quality of the reproduction and the imbedded story.

I have no problems with the quality of the DVDs but other reviewers may feel differently.  I have a lot of tolerance for the quality of he media for oldies - much different standards than I might apply to newer movies.  I guess that I'm just happy to see them in any guise.

With regard to the story:  what can I say beyond just falling back on the clich that these two movies are classics?  I can only advise viewers to watch these with an open mind to the story and to set aside expectations of special effects and visual 'artistry'.",1378944000,2,667,4.338709677419355
2658043,5,B000IJ7AGK,"Both films, were well composed and suspenseful.  Neither is very long, about 1 hour and 15 minutes each, so perfect for a weeknight.",1369699200,,132,4.739130434782608
2658044,5,B000IJ7AGK,Film arrived swiftly and was as described. Hope to make time to watch it soon. It is a great Classic and warrents a rainy evening with a fire going for full effect.,1323734400,2,164,4.15625
2658045,5,B000IJ7AGK,"First off, let me say that its very difficult to read through reviews when people do not specify which release of the film they are reviewing.  This review is for the And Then There Were None Marengo Films Release.  I bought this version of the film as I read glowing reviews for the film transfer.  For comparison, I also own the Madacy release of this film.  The difference is CLEARLY NOTICEABLE.  The Marengo transfer has a much better pitcure.  The background noise found on the Madacy release are gone here, as are the mistimed audio.  Those with Madacy copies or some of the other terrible free versions will know ceratin scenes where the audio and video are nt matched properly.  Not here folks.  When I watched this copy last night it was like seeing the movie again for the first time.  I can finally clearly make out facial features and better hear the soundtrack.  I cannot highly reccomend this enough.  I must admit that I cannot review ""The Most Dangerous Game"" copy on this disc as I have not watched it yet.  If you are a fan of ""And Then There Were None"" you must own this dvd version release.  There are ZERO extra features which is different from other releases.  The Madacy for extra has a Trivia Quiz, and some really interesting Newsreel footage, making it worth having as well, but for pure crisp video transfer, this is the definitive release to have. (Maybe one day Criterion will get there hands on it..... Here's to hoping!)",1323734400,5,1451,4.591439688715953
2658046,4,B000IJ7AGK,"And Then There Were None.  A wonderful story.  A charming film.  But they changed the ending, which is infuriating as the ending of any ""Who-done-it?"" is really the entire climax of the story.  And of all the mysteries ever written, the elements of ""Who did it and How was it done"" were perhaps never more intense than in this book.  Christie fans will know what I am talking about.  I suggest you read the story first, if you haven't already, and then purchase this film.  This is my favorite Christie story.  Since apparently no one will make this book into a film that is true to the book, this is as good as it gets.
Someone, PLEASE make a movie out of this book, and stick to the plot completely!!!  It is supposed to be ""And Then There Were NONE"" not ""And Then There Were Still SOME""

I haven't gotten around to watching The Most Dangerous Game, so I can't comment.",1226188800,7,871,4.354037267080745
2658047,5,B000IJ7AGK,"The original 1932 version of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is the best example of ""less is more"" that I can find.  It's two hours worth of drama, thrills and action packed into a mere 63 minutes!  The Marengo transfers for this and AND THEN THERE WERE NONE are excellent, and you can't beat the price!  The Criterion print of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is only very slightly better, but in my opinion, the Criterion price of at least $30.00 that you'd have to pay for a 63 minute movie is just not worth it.  For those who must own this movie, this is your best bet.",1208476800,16,557,4.226415094339623
2658048,5,B000IJ7AGK,"These two movies from Marengo are very good prints although I think ""The Most Dangerous Game"" had a better picture. As for sound, ""Most Dangerous Game"" was sharper with higher frequencies more obvious. ""And Then There Were None"" had sound more soft and not as sharp. An excellent buy for two excellent movies.",1195084800,8,309,4.849056603773585
2658049,4,B000IJ7AGK,"First of all let me explain this review : as people who read my other reviews will know I have a great DISaffection for low budget companies who put out lousy copies of public domain films...HOWEVER..I took the chance with Marengo based upon the generally favorable reviews and I was NOT dissapointed ! Yes, indeed, there is a glowing review with each and every one of these dvd's, obviously written by a guy who works for that company(he doesn't even make a secret of that!)...but for once that is honest publicity because the prints are indeed clear and crisp and the sound is good to very good !
Of course you will still get a better print with the Criterion edition, there are a few minor faults with this print, the framing of ""the most dangerus game"" is a bit off, but do not let that deter you from buying this dvd because everything else is as good as it will ever get for a dvd in this price range and in the public domain ! This is without any doubt the ""best value for money"" buy and with these prices(and hoping the other prints on their dvd's are as good as these) I will be buying more from this company..;and i will keep you informed, objectively and non-allied, as to the quality of their prints!",1187913600,32,1212,4.367256637168142
2658050,5,B000IJ7AGK,"Mike is correct in his rating of this DVD, as well as the Marengo product in general. For a mostly Public Domain DVD company, it doesn't get much better than Marengo Films.",1181606400,9,172,4.40625
2658051,5,B000IJ7AGK,"If you have been looking for quality transfers of these two titles, here they are. MARENGO'S work on THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is every bit as good as the CRITERION version and, in my opinion, better in one respect. The Marengo transfer is printed a shade lighter which results in sharper details in the outdoor night scenes which comprise the vast majority of this wonderfully exciting classic. And the clear and booming audio track will blow you away as well.

For AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, MARENGO does a freeze frame on each of the main titles with a seamless bleed over from one to the other. This completely clears up the soft focus and distortion caused by the jumpiness of the main titles in the IMAGE version. And the rest of the transfer is sharp with a clean and clear soundtrack.

Kudos to MARENGO for a job well done.",1172448000,30,828,4.513333333333334

8145772,4,B000IJ7AGK,"""The Most Dangerous Game"" was a major let down!  Sadly I couldn't disregard the campiness.  Leonard Maltin obviously saw something I missed.  ""And Then There Were None"" as very good.  In many ways it remained truer to the book.  Not as good as the more recent 3 part series, but so glad to own it.  I'll watch it again.",1480982400,2,319,4.322033898305085

8145776,3,B000IJ7AGK,"This was a great movie combo for my classroom. The film itself is clear and looks great. However, I found that the video itself was a little quiet. I had the volume on the player, computer, and external speakers turned up to max and still some of the students had a hard time hearing in the back of the room--so I ended up having to try and find it streaming online (which was sad because the visual quality wasn't as nice as it had been on the DVD).",1475884800,,450,4.125
