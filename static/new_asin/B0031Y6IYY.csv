8571241,5,B0031Y6IYY,"I felt in love with The Stone Child the first time I saw its footage in the Internet a few months ago. It was the Going's kid face, its scar, his curious eyes, his apparent shyness; I wanted to know his story. And then, magically, this little jewel of a film somehow roped me in to the kid's world with an intensity I had not felt for a long time. It transmuted me into the kid. At his here and now. I could ""feel"" and ""think"" with him and face the fear and the uncertainty until getting to know and understand his own entity and change and move forward.  I ""was"" him.

There was no need for any explanatory dialogue or a 1 hour and half of film for that. That is the sheer force of The Stone Child script and images, which so wisely and delicately introduce the parallel ways of this child and the world he is facing, one pebble with its own singularity in the middle of the fearsome immensity of the badlands, but a place to belong not to fight against.

Then, sometime afterwards, I revisited that web site to see The Stone Child again and realized there was an excerpt of the story behind this short film.  An intense and deeply moving big story under what was the iceberg tip that this short was meant to be. Maybe, one day, we will get that whole story in the big screen. But if you, like me, you truly believe that good things come in small packages, you won't wait for it and instead you will let yourself get carried away for The Stone Child now. It's 100% worth its price and then some.",1266710400,2,1496,4.2020905923344944
