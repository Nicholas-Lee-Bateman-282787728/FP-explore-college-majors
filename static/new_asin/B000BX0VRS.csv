8093682,4,B000BX0VRS,"There are three highly rated films in this box and if you like at least 2 of the 3,
you have a very good value here. For me,the outstanding film was Donnie Brasco which
had terrific performances by Pacino and Depp. The comments by Joe Pistone
(whose story is being told in the movie) about how the movie and reality differed
(in small ways only) was quite interesting. For Bugsy,I wish the movie had covered
more of his early life (his rise) and cut back on some of the later material
(less of Jack Dragna and Hollywood). Snatch was a bit difficult to get a grip on with
its close mix of comedy and crime. In this it bears a close resemblance to Cotton
Comes to Harlem. Please see the reviews of the individual DVDs for more details.",1314057600,2,733,4.318840579710145
