367630,5,6301801148,"The best film in Universal's Sherlock Holmes series is also the best Holmes mystery ever put on the screen. I first saw ""The Scarlet Claw"" in July 1967 when a local TV station aired it at the last minute in honor of Basil Rathbone who had passed away earlier that day. It was the first time I had seen Rathbone in something other than a latter day American International horror film, but sentiment aside, this film is a classic, a macabre thriller perfect in every department.
When we first see Holmes and Watson, they are attending an occult convention in Canada where the great detective is the lone dissenter, expressing skepticism and challenging the theory that a supernatural creature is behind a series of grisly murders in a nearby village. The great detective is soon on the case, and the setting is a perfect one for Holmes to ply his trade.
Everything about ""The Scarlet Claw"" works. The director, Roy William Neill, reaches a peak here, providing moments that will make your skin crawl and cloaking the mystery in a rich atmosphere as memorable as the story. The cast is simply perfect. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce have never been better, and they receive fine support from Paul Cavanaugh, Kay Harding, and especially Gerald Hamer, a series regular who almost steals the movie from its stars.
It isn't based on a story by Arthur Conan Doyle, and unlike most entries in the series, doesn't claim to be, but ""The Scarlet Claw"" is the best Sherlock Holmes film made by Universal or any other studio.",1073260800,8,1511,4.7272727272727275
367631,5,6301801148,"The single most famous Sherlock Holmes story...as well as the most popular...is, without a doubt, ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"". It has been in publication forever and is anthologized, eulogized, and satirized endlessly. And it has appeared on film almost as much as it has in print. Likely no other Holmes story has seen more screen incarnations as this one.
  In the late 1930s Twentieth Century Fox did a classic version of this story with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson...and created a version of this detective team that became the long-standing yardstick for judging Holmes/Watson screen portrayals.
  Oddly, though, Fox didn't really seem to have an inclination to carry on with this concept in series format, and so ""Hound"" was basically a ""one-off"" for them (Though they DID do one weak sequel, ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", which paled in comparison). Not so with Universal Pictures, however. They liked the idea of a Rathbone/Bruce series and cranked one up in the 1940s that did well.
  In the mid 1940s Universal decided to re-tool ""Hound"" and this film, ""The Scarlet Claw"", is the result. The Baskervilles got dropped from the storyline, as did Dartmoor and the giant ""hellhound""and its demonic legend. The story got moved to a desolate marshland in Canada and the hound became a ghostly,glowing, manlike ""marsh monster""(in ""Hound"" the villain paints the killer dog's mouth with luminous paint, in ""Claw"" the villain wears luminous clothing...a twist on the original, but very effective). Some characters,relationships and motives got reworked and Holmes & Watson were then set on the trail. The Result? The hands-down BEST film in the Universal Holmes series. Without a doubt. Tense, eerie, exciting. ""Claw"" is all of these things and more. If you like Sherlock Holmes then you'll love this. A real Keeper on DVD.

No one, (at least in my opinion) has ever been able to fill the shoes of the character of Sherlock Holmes as good as Basil Rathbone, and I've seen many versions of Sherlock Holmes. In this one, Sherlock is attending an occult conference in Canada when one of the attendee's wives is found murdered in a nearby village. The village where she was murdered is rumored to be roamed by a ghostly like monster who claws out people's throats. Sherlock doesn't buy the ""monster"" story, and after getting a letter from a frightened lady asking him to help her, Sherlock heads out with his trusty aide (which is, as always superbly played by Nigel Bruce) to look into the mystery. Lots of twists and turns in this movie. The one thing I've always liked about the Sherlock Holmes character is his courage. In Hound Of The Baskervilles, almost everyone was afraid to venture out at night in fear of the monster like hound, But not Sherlock!!! And in this one, he shows that same raw courage. Almost everyone in the village was afraid to venture out after dark, but Sherlock went out alone looking for the monster (and found him). But did Sherlock run? Heck no!!! That monster didn't know who he was messing with!!! Instead of running from the beast, Sherlock takes out his pistol, fires a few shots and starts chasing IT!!! Sherlock don't take no junk from anybody!!! If you like a spooky story with a great plot, if you like action, drama, comedy, horror, suspense, and courage, you'll love this unique film.

Holmes and Watson find themselves involved in the mystery of 'La Morte Rouge' (was Lady Penrose the victim of a supernatural monster, or was her throat ripped out by an ogre of the human variety?) in this brilliantly eerie suspense drama. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are their usual wonderfully cast selves and are matched by a marvellous supporting cast. Directed by Holmes veteran Roy William Neill,  the film has a great, suspenseful (naturally) climax that may surprise the most adept Holmes fans (provided they haven't seen it before!).

367662,5,6301801148,"As has already been stated, this was only the 2nd time that Holmes and Watson are taken out of the UK. And this is a totally original Story, written by Roy William Neil, produced and directed by Neil. And wow what a film, a little village  La Morte Rouge have been terrified by a legendary glowing monster. And the film literally opens with the tolling of a church bell,  and the town's postman Potts rushes into The towns cafe to find the priest. Together they get to the church and find the body of a beautiful young woman still clutching the bell rope, with her throat tore out. She is Lady Penrose, and her husband is contacted, he's addressing a meeting of the Royal Canadian Occult Society in Quebec, and Holmes and Watson are there as well.  Lord Penrose decides to rush home and take care of the body of his wife, as Holmes and Watson prepare to leave, Holmes receives a letter addressed to him, from the dead lady. After reading it, Holmes decides to take the case, and goes to La Morte Rogue, Lord Penrose believes the killer is supernatural, but Holmes believes the killer is using the legend of the monster to kill people. Yes Watson is alittle clumsy in this movie,  but not too much. Holmes figures out pretty early actually who the killer is, but the neat thing, The killer is an actor, has created many characters that interact throughout the village, after 2 more murders have been committed, Holmes gets an idea, and with the help of the last victim. He draws out the killer,  The  atmosphere in this movie is amazing, Throughout the whole movie, the tension is there, and anybody could be the murderer. In my opinion the best Rathbone Holmes movie.",1407110400,,1667,4.54

367667,4,6301801148,"The Scarlet Claw is quite a movie full of suspense and innuendo as well as a few comic moments.  Basil Rathbone is perfect as the unfazed Sherlock Holmes.  It is the eighth film in the Rathbone/Bruce series.

I always liked the character actor Gerard Hamer, most familiar in an original Star Trek episode.  Here he plays the butler and a few others as well!  But I'm getting ahead of the game.

Basic Ideas:

Holmes and Watson are visiting Canada listening to a Mr. Penrose and his theories on the supernatural.  Holmes puts him in his place and says that deductive reasoning would handle any such superstition.  Just then a letter.  The Lady Penrose has been murdered.  A bit earlier we found villagers wondering about a church bell going off and a priest discovering the body of Ms. Penrose.

Interestingly, just before her murder, she managed to get a letter to Holmes and Watson that her life was in danger.  Holmes remarks that this is the first time he has been retained by a corpse and off we go!

Is there a real ghost or is the murderer more of the mortal variety?

Well that question is put to rest very fast.  By the middle of the film we already know who the murderer is, but we don't know what disguise he is in.  The killer is a master of disguise and as the body count increases the viewer becomes more and more involved in the story.

There is some silly humor as when Watson ends up on a bog a couple of times or is instructed to remain inconspicuous, which is practically impossible!

DVD:

The cinematography was great, with the mist & fog, the building of mood through light and shadow.  The UCLA renovation was great as well, with proper contrast of the picture and was not muddied up which is what I hate about a lot of these Universal films from the '40s with their muddy, black renditions.

Parental advisory

A young teenaged girl is murdered in teh picture, not gruesomely so (it is 1942 after all) but still, it is shocking.

Bottom Line:

Great piece of detective work, great murder mystery.  Technically the story was never written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but clearly has his style.  The DVD however has no special features at all which is really too bad and loses a star due to that!

I'm amazed at some of the reviews here calling this the best of the Rathbone Holmes. For my money it's barely in the top five, out of fourteen. It's got some really hokey scenes, some laughably obvious effects, and a script that in no way comes close to those of Faces Death or The Adventures Of. It's not even as entertaining as the previous entry in the series, Scarlet Claw.

Rathbone is excellent as always, but there's not a lot of the real Sherlock feel for me here, outside of plenty of fog and a swamp to add some all-too-convenient ""atmosphere"". It's pretty clear this is a purely Hollywood creation and not based on any Doyle story at all. He had a touch with plot lines that's missing here, and it all feels a little too much like, ""let's move the series to Canada for an episode and use plenty of stereotypes"".

There's not a Canadian accent in the bunch, and I'm surprised no one sings ""Frere Jacques"" or cuts down a tree wearing a lumberjack shirt. It's all too predictable, and while any Rathbone Holmes is worth watching, I'd put this one in the middle of the pack, not bad but hardly a classic.

The UCLA transfer is very fine as usual, but that's a problem here: some of the bad sets, background paintings and weak effects become even more so when seen in such high definition. I'd rather see this one all scratched up, in fact!

Watch this before or after SHFD or TAOSH and see what you think. I think there's no comparison at all.",1274745600,,1461,4.396296296296296
367669,5,6301801148,"I love Canada myself but who knows why they decided to film The Scarlet Claw in some studio backlots and call it the swamps of Quebec?  If I had the version with the expert commentary on it, maybe I would know.  But I'm just guessing it was some directive from the higher-ups concerning Pan-American unity.  The movie does have a nauseating salute to Canada at the end, spoken as Holmes and Watson are driving away from the spooky village of Le Morte Rouge.  The film itself is memorably chilling and suggestive, almost like one of the Val Lewton horrors being made over at RKO at just about the same time.

The opening scenes, of villagers crowded into a well-lit tavern to pass the night, a night in which they feel blood will be shed, is very effective at building up the atmosphere.  The young barmaid, Marie, is the daughter of the proprietor, a man who, we learn, came to the bar after a career as a prison jailer.  Once we learn this fact the story sort of unfolds naturally from there.  And also once we hear that Lady Penrose, her throat torn out just as you might tear out the throat of a sheep, was once the toast of Canada as a leading soubrette, under the name of Lily Gentry.  Lillie Langtry anyone?

My wife guessed who did it within the first few minutes of the movie and maintained her conviction through all the plot's admirable twists and turns.  I have to hand it to women's intuition: sometimes it gets the job done when even Holmes is perplexed and poor Watson falls repeatedly into those comfortable, Hobbit-hole-like holes in the marsh surface.",1261958400,,1568,4.524822695035461
367670,5,6301801148,"Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Claw is a first class example of the fine series of films featuring Basil Rathbone as the great detective and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson.

Holmes and Watson find themselves in Canada attending a conference when two events happen in close sequence.  His main debate opponent at the conference gets word of his wife's death, and moments later Holmes receives a letter from the dead woman asking for help as she fears for her life.

The excellent plot and acting are complimented by a feature concerning the restoration of all the old Rathbone Holmes films, the background and commentary are very informative and explain much concerning the varying quality of the prints available.

The commentary offered also gives insights on the movie but I would take one exception to an opinion shown.  The commentator points two a couple of flubs and bumps that would normally have been cut out of the picture if it had a better budget, he speakers as if they were serious problems but to me they seem like the normal bumps and stumbles over speech that normal people actually have.  I think it adds rather than subtracts from the film and I'd like to see more of it.

Plus, there's a patriotic tribute to Canada at the tag end.",1232496000,4,360,4.507692307692308
367715,5,6301801148,"First, I want to point out that THIS is the copy of this film that you want. It's been re-worked by the UCLA film lab and was digitized from a very pristine black and white 35 mm print. All other copies are inferior to this one. The aspect is full-screen.

As to the story, it takes place in a small Canadian Hamlet where an aristocrat's wife has been murdered. She had tried to contact Sherlock Holmes by letter of her impending demise, but alas, too late!!! However,  Holmes and Dr. Watson (Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce) commit to avenging Lady Penrose's death by unveiling her murderer, a dastardly serial killer who uses a toothed gardening trowel as his weapon of choice.

The mysterious aristocrat, (played by the amazing Paul Cavanaugh), wants Holmes off the case but, of course, Holmes ignores the man's veiled threats and persists in his inquiries. Soon, another murder sets Holmes and Watson to redouble their efforts before futher disasters follow, (which they do).

In this film, we get a little reincarnation of ""The Hound"" as Holmes and Watson track their shrewd nemesis into the nearby swamps where this killer lurks like a phosphorescent apparition. But, of course, Holmes has been this route before!

The movie is a film-noir, moreso than previous Rathbone/Bruce entries, due to one particular murder in the story, (can't say which one because it's a SPOILER!), which makes this particular killer all that much more of a rotten scoundrel. Viewers will also note that the cast is bulging with crusty old curmudgeons, perhaps the most profound, and the best ever cast, of any in this renowned film series.

I have my favorites in the Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes series of films, (I'm really hot on ""Sherlock Holmes Faces Death""), but I have to say that this entry certainly upholds the excellence for which these great old black and white British mysteries are known.",1200528000,4,1887,4.899686520376176
367716,4,6301801148,"Universal's Sherlock Holmes series brought the characters into the 20th Century.  Many of the were related to World War II, stories in which Holmes went in pursuit of spies and counterspies; others tried to mimic the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories with a presentation of mental puzzles.  Although generally well executed, seldom did any of the titles rise above the level of ""B Pictures""--but on the rare occasions that they did, they did so with a vengence, and THE SCARLET CLAW is such a case.  Directed at a fast clip by Roy William Neill, memorably photographed by George Robinson, and sporting an expert cast in a particularly clever script, this is easily among the best of the series.

The story harkens back to such titles as THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES.  Lord Penrose (Paul Cavanaugh) is convinced that his small, Canadian town is beset by an evil spirit--and is indeed giving a lecture on psychic phenomena when his wife is found murdered, presumably by a apparition that haunted the town many years before.  Convinced that it is the work of an otherwordly being, he does not welcome the arrival of Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone), who is convinced that there is nothing ghostly about the matter in the least.

The Universal films counted a great deal on the chemistry between Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and sidekick Dr. Watson, and indeed that chemistry is on full display in this particular title.  But the overall cast is remarkably fine, not only the aforementioned Cavanaugh but most particularly Gerald Hammer, who frequently appeared in these films and here offers a uniquely memorable turn as the fearful postmaster.  And, unlike most other films in the series, the solution to the crime is indeed a shocker.

The restoration is very handsome and the DVD comes with two nice bonuses, a short documentary on the challenges faced by those who restored the series (THE SCARLET CLAW receives particular mention) and an erudite audio commentary by film historian David Stuart Davies.  If you've seen one or two films in the series and been unimpressed--give this one a try to see what Rathbone and company could do when when they had all the right makings.  Recommended.

367717,5,6301801148,"A ghost is seen in a swampy area, and numerous people confirm the sighting of this obviously-luminous ghost. Bodies of sheep and humans are found nearby. Each has the same, distinctive throat wound. Sherlock Holmes does not believe in ghosts. But how is he to find out what exactly this ""ghostly"" killer is? He fearlessly goes alone into the swampy area at night to encounter and examine this ""ghost"". Shivers!

Later, the clues begin to pile up: A fragment of rarely-made clothing gets torn off the ""ghost"", the throat wounds of all the victims fit the pattern of a mini-rake garden tool, a half-torn photograph matches its complementary part found at a suspect's home, and there are astonishing coincidences in the presence and absence of particular people in the town.

But Sherlock Holmes does not have it easy. The killer is very clever and elusive. What's more, the killer keeps changing his identity. At one point, he even masquerades as a woman. Finally, Sherlock Holmes is held up at gunpoint by the killer. Will Holmes become the latest victim of this murderer? If not, will Sherlock and Watson be able to finally apprehend the killer? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.

The sensitive viewer may appreciate the fact that this old movie, unlike the new ones, is conspicuously free of gory scenes. For example, a woman whose throat was cut, but who manages to ring a church bell before dying, is not shown with a throat wound, even when the face of her body is viewed by Sherlock Holmes.

367720,4,6301801148,"On the surface, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SCARLET CLAW is just another entry in Universal's Sherlock Holmes series.  One could make an argument that it's a Holmes-by-numbers production.  Indeed, I can't think of any major story element that wasn't done in some earlier or later picture.  There's the ghostly apparition, the grisly murder, the mysterious marshland, the secretive villagers, the disguises, etc.  Yet, all the standard elements are done exceedingly well here.  Everything is firing on all cylinders.  It may not be the most original of adventures, but it is one of the most enjoyable.

THE SCARLET CLAW is an above-average atmospheric movie in a series that thrived on providing a grim, tense feeling.  Director Roy William Neill was more than used to delivering a stark thriller, but he's really going all out here.  There's nothing extremely out of the ordinary, which is perhaps why the movie is such a success.  With no propaganda to ram through, no experimentation, and no surprises, the cast and crew can simply concentrate on what they do best -- making a damn entertaining movie.

The direction is superb.  The acting is up to it's usual high standard.  By this point, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce could play these characters in their sleep, so their performances are precisely what you would and should expect.  Bruce's Dr. Watson is again relegated to comic relief, but it's a role he plays very well.  The supporting cast is made up of the usual entertaining character actors.

The script contains enough of the standard Sherlock Holmes elements for it to feel familiar, even considering that it is not a straight adaptation of story actually written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Although I've not seen all of the Holmes Universal movies (I have watched most of them), this is the one I think of as the standard by which all others are measured.  It did a lot of the things we expect these movies to do and it did they very well.

367723,5,6301801148,"""The Scarlet Claw"" (aka: ""Sherlock Holmes And The Scarlet Claw"") was made in 1944, and represents the 8th Sherlock film in the fourteen-movie series starring the ever-pleasing duo of Basil Rathbone as Mr. Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. John H. Watson. This is most certainly one of the better films in the Rathbone/Bruce franchise of Sherlock flicks -- a successful and entertaining franchise that began with the outstanding 1939 version of ""The Hound Of The Baskervilles"", and ended with ""Dressed To Kill"" in 1946.
""The Scarlet Claw"" was one of three Sherlock Holmes' entries produced in the calendar year of 1944. Basil Rathbone was one busy Sherlock during this mid-'40s time period, cranking out yet another three Holmes' motion pictures the following year of 1945 as well.
""Claw"" exudes a feeling of tension and dread right from the very first scene. The viewer is reeled into the mysterious happenings immediately, as we wonder ""Who -- or What -- is ringing that church bell at this hour of the night?"".  A very effective, and eerie, opening to the picture.
Our favorite pipe-smoking detective from London's 221B Baker Street is soon called into this baffling case, which features murder victims being found with their throats torn open -- presumably caused by the elusive ""Monster of La Morte Rouge"".
The film conveys a realistic sense of the foggy, damp atmosphere that permeates the marshes surrounding the small village where these gruesome murders are taking place. This ""atmosphere"" is particularly powerful during the climactic scene at the end of the film.
This DVD version of ""Claw"" comes via MPI Home Video, and displays nicely-restored video quality, thanks to the praise-worthy preservation efforts undertaken by the ""UCLA Film and Television Archive"". This black-and-white Holmes' classic has most certainly never looked better on any home video format.
The DVD's soundtrack is pleasing enough, although not completely free from all background ""crackle"". It's a Dolby Digital 2-Channel Mono track used here, with no alternate-language track employed.
This stand-alone, single-disc edition of ""The Scarlet Claw"" contains nothing but the film itself. No supplemental bonus features are present whatsoever. There's a simple static Main Menu, with just one lonely Sub-Menu (for the 11 Chapter Selections).

Sherlock Holmes and Watson are there to argue for a non-superstitious answer to unusual happenings. The meeting is cut short when Lord Penrose receives a call that his wife has been found dead, her hand still hold the church bell rope in La Morte Rouge. And Sherlock is on the case.

""The Scarlet Claw"" is the 8th Basil Rathbone Holmes movie. It came out in 1942 and is 74 minutes long. English subtitles are available on the disc, but there is no Bonus Feature. I thought this is a good movie in the Rathbone/Bruce series. Not the best, but enjoyable viewing.

The movie is included in a collection of all 14 of the Sherlock films which Rathbone made with Bruce,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Sherlock-Holmes-Collection/dp/B000EXZFRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection</a>. If you get  ""The Scarlet Claw"" in the Collection, you can enjoy watching the movie a second time with a Commentary Track.

I am a fan of many film and TV iterations of Sherlock Holmes, and that includes the Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock series. My favorite quote in the movie is when Holmes says, ""The first time I've been retained by a corpse.""

7815610,5,6301801148,"Of all the 14 movies of this Holmes / Rathbone / Bruce series, this is my favorite. For the most part, it is sort of dark, haunting, and has a great air of mystery to it. The presence of Rathbone and Bruce only adds a touch of class to this timeless classic. The next one in descending order would be ""the House of Fear."" Same two leading actors in the next great one of this series of films. OK. ""the Hound of the Baskervilles"" gets the Bronze. Great picks on all counts. Family films suitable for all members of the family, including the grandkids.",1500595200,,550,4.298076923076923

7815612,2,6301801148,"Typically crummy Universal Sherlock Holmes film suffers from the same problems as much of the series--Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson is a disgrace, a comic relief imbecile, the movie does not take place in period (Victorian England) and, in this case, the movie isn't even based on an actual Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story.  The one and only good thing about this Holmes entry is the atmosphere, which has the look and feel of a Universal monster movie and turns out to be entirely appropriate given the story.

A woman is murdered in a small Canadian village, her throat torn out and the people who live there believe that it's the work of a clawed monster that haunts the bogs at night and has killed a number of sheep in an identical manner.  Even the woman's husband believes in the existence of the monster (or at least pretends to) but Holmes is certain the perpetrator is a mortal man and that the supernatural trappings are nothing more than a smokescreen to divert attention away from a human culprit.

The set-up is fine but the writing is far from clever.  For one thing, I'm pretty sure people in Canada don't speak with British accents and have never seen any fog-laden moors there.  I didn't even realize this didn't take place in England until the second time I watched it.  Then there are the inexcusably lazy plot holes--for instance, the coincidence of three people involved with the same big city criminal case all settling in the exact same remote village--a place where one character says strangers rarely come.  Since there are three people the murderer has vowed to kill the fact that they all settled in the exact same village is certainly convenient for him--but it's a pretty ridiculous thing to ask the audience to believe.  Then there is the idea that the very meticulous and intelligent murderer would actually return to a hideout even though he knew it had already been discovered by Holmes and Watson and the police.  That's just lazy writing not worthy of Conan Doyle or Sherlock Holmes.

I will admit to liking the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films very little after the first two in the series which were made by 20th Century Fox--The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.  Those two films had excellent production values, were set in Victorian England and were closer to the spirit and quality of Conan Doyle's original stories.  The Universal movies, on the other hand, were updated to WW2 era England, frequently had stories that were written especially for the films and were low budget B-movies all the way.  If you have a tolerance for the Universal Sherlock Holmes films this is probably one of the better ones--at least he isn't battling Nazis in this one.",1465776000,,2720,4.771855010660981

It begins with the tolling of a bell. A Postman enters a tavern. Who is tolling the church bell? They tell of two sheep whose throats were torn out. Men return to the church. The priest finds a body! People talk of a phantom in the marshes. Lady Penrose is dead! The police are notified, so too the husband. The Occult Society meets in Quebec. They talk about the dead sheep. What is the cause? Lord Penrose tells of his wifes death, he will hurry back home. Holmes received a letter asking for help - from a dead woman! Holmes and Watson investigate the wound; they are the same as on those sheep. Lillian Gentry was a famous American actress. Holmes and Watson go to the local hotel. People are frightened. Why would a man leave town?

They say a monster did the killing; like a werewolf. Or was it a man who took advantage of the legend? Watson is asked to question the villagers in the tavern. One man leaves town because of fear. The marshes are dangerous at night. Watson talks about The Invisible Man by G. K. Chesterton. [This tells about a man who is not seen or noticed because he is part of the background.] Holmes hears the bell tolling and goes to investigate. Is he armed? There is a figure glowing in the dark! Watson met the glowing man but fell into the bog. Holmes now knows it is a man not a monster from the piece of cloth. These shirts were only sold to a retired judge. Holmes and Watson visit him in the morning. Judge Brisson rejects them at first; he is afraid. He doesnt need a wheelchair but still uses it. Brisson gave away shirts that were worn out.

A man with a limp lives in a deserted house. Tanner has a glowing shirt! He jumps out the window to escape! The Sergeant shoots at him! This closes the case. [Or does it?] Holmes investigates the records of Lady Penrose and learns about the past. Holmes says Alistair Ramson the actor has another personage in the village. He telephones Judge Brisson to warn him. Will Holmes arrive in time? The housekeeper says I don't know! The killer was disguised as the housekeeper. Holmes meets Jack Tanner and questions him; he plans another murder. Who will it be? Watson makes a noise, Holmes escapes.

Holmes deduces this man was Journe, the hotel keeper who used to work at that prison where Ramson was held. Where is his daughter Marie? There is another victim. Holmes gets a telephone call and rushes off with Watson to find Journe at the house of a victim. Holmes and Watson must return to London, the murderer escaped to America. This ruse brings Ransom out of hiding, and Holmes catches him and removes his disguise. [Were you surprised?] Ransom runs away but is stopped and killed by a villager! Later Holmes speaks of Canada as the link between Great Britain and America (a quote from Churchill).

This story is composed of pieces from the original stories by Conan Doyle to make and interesting and entertaining drama. The bogs and disguises recall The Hound of the Baskervilles. Revenge was the motive in The Valley of Fear and A Study in Scarlet. The small village setting recalls the first two stories; other stories were set in London. There are added jokes for comedy. A reference to another mystery story is unusual but relevant. The right to keep and bear arms was unquestioned then.",1457308800,,3318,4.532554257095159
