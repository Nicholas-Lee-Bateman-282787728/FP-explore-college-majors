8221329,1,B000W6FBW4,"I'm reviewing this edition of ""Pleasantville"" only.  I see that it is currently unavailable, but thought I'd post a warning anyway.  I bought this several years ago (just the one movie) . . . and watched it several times and it was fine.  The third time I watched it, it skipped and stopped frequently, in various places.  It was unwatchable.  I examined the surface of the DVD closely under good light and could find NO markings or defects.  Since I take excellent care with my DVDs and no one else had handled it, I was certain I'd not damaged it.  On my next trip to the video rental store, I asked them if they would mind ""reconditioning"" that video and they were happy to.  But the treatment did not help at all.

There's something wrong with this ""New Line Platinum Edition"" and it would be unwise to buy it.  Goes to show you can give something a fancy name, but it's a joke if the product is crappy.",1504396800,,907,4.345238095238095
