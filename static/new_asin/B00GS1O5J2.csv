6105827,4,B00GS1O5J2,"If you previously purchased the 13 episode APPLESEED XIII boxed set...
this is just a re-editing of the series, removing much of the exposition and
turning the 13 episodes into two, 1.5 hour nonstop action movies.

So, nothing new, just remixed in a similar fashion to what they did with the
Ghost In the Shell: Stand Alone Complex DVD sets.

Image quality is just as good as the full 13 episode series.",1394755200,44,403,4.583333333333333
6105828,3,B00GS1O5J2,"If you are wondering what this is, it is apparently the 13 episode TV series edited into 2 movies. I  haven't seen it yet, but I thought I would save some people time searching the internet (and maybe $30)",1386201600,81,205,4.256410256410256
6105829,5,B00GS1O5J2,I am a fan of the Appleseed stories and it has been quite a while since I saw the last one so these were very welcome and a lot of fun.,1423612800,3,135,3.3870967741935485
6105830,5,B00GS1O5J2,I love the Appleseed Trilogy and I just want to get this 2 movie box set! The Appleseed series is really fun to watch!,1418169600,,118,3.9583333333333335
6105831,5,B00GS1O5J2,Very good animate,1417910400,,17,5.0
6105832,5,B00GS1O5J2,loved it,1412294400,,8,3.5
6105833,2,B00GS1O5J2,"I was very disappointed with these movies. The animation was not the same caliber as the previous movies, the voice acting was sub par, the storyline got MUCH more weird and worst of all they deviated/tried to reconstruct the history story line. With such terrible continuity (the mother was gunned down on the street in Africa because she was black? We saw her mother in the first Appleseed, not black and killed in a lab) how could anyone like it?",1406505600,,449,4.625
6105834,3,B00GS1O5J2,"These two films are not as stylized as the first two, but they are not too bad. Everybody else is a little bit pickier when it comes to their anime. Its up to you if this is your movie or not. If you're not sure, check out the triailers on youtube first and decide for yourself.",1404432000,6,278,3.982142857142857
6105835,5,B00GS1O5J2,very good i am impressed and i plan on buying more movies in this genre in the near future thanks!,1401840000,,98,3.95
6105836,1,B00GS1O5J2,"Please do not waste your money on this. I should have read reviews first. If you are looking for action like in the first two Appleseeds, this is not it.  Putting in my junk movie pile, to give away. Had no idea what the story line was about., except a lot whining and no action. Fell asleep trying to watch it,  Had to get up and turn it off , because it was that boring. Oh well lost $23.00 bucks on that one. What a let down.",1401062400,7,428,3.9080459770114944
6105837,3,B00GS1O5J2,Appleseed Xiii is was disappointing because it's the same as the previous Appleseed just in a different rapping. It's a fraud a people should get their money back.,1399420800,,163,4.857142857142857
6105838,1,B00GS1O5J2,The movie wasn't good. I expected more action. The other appleseed movies were great.  Wish I seen it before buying it,1399075200,,118,4.619047619047619
8626601,1,B00GS1O5J2,"I got this as a gift. I really enjoyed the other Appleseed movies, Appleseed, Appleseed Alpha and Appleseed Ex Machina. This movie was nothing like the other three. The animation drawing was terrible and the story was terrible and choppy. I felt totally gyped after watching this. The animation looks like it was drawn by a 5 year old. Stay away from this. It was extremely disappointing. It is nothing like the first three movies.",1518739200,,431,4.76
8626602,4,B00GS1O5J2,a little slow and hard to follow,1515542400,,32,3.7142857142857144
8626603,4,B00GS1O5J2,"in this two disc set Deunan and Briareos most stop a woman from killing a group of Bioroids because they all have her husband's genes. she can't stand this because she believes that the Bioroids are a betrayal of her husbands dream of a paradise where humans work to make paradise on earth with there own hard work. Deunan and Briareos struggle with their relationship, hello Deunan even asks Briareos if they should get married.",1498089600,,429,4.733333333333333
8626604,5,B00GS1O5J2,Love the art style and great action.,1492560000,,36,4.285714285714286
8626605,5,B00GS1O5J2,Another good movie but still lost on watching order?  I liked the action and story line.  I liked the villan and the movie did resemble some connection to the other older apleseed movies.  Was worth adding to my colection of the other movies I own.,1488844800,,248,4.466666666666667
8626606,3,B00GS1O5J2,story is a little slow .,1471737600,,24,3.1666666666666665
8626607,4,B00GS1O5J2,Altho the animation isn't like the movies it still wasn't a bad seies,1451779200,,69,4.384615384615385
8626608,3,B00GS1O5J2,"Not as good as the first two movies as far as the technical aspects.  The animation and artwork were disappointing when you look at the prior two films.  However, I thought the story held up well, although there seemed to be some inconsistency between the first two films and this one.  I understand this movie was a collection of the Japanese TV series, but the storyline seemed a bit inconsistent in terms of the relationship of the two primary characters.",1437523200,3,458,4.7
8626609,5,B00GS1O5J2,The animation doesn't compare to the other Appleseed movies but still a great add to the collection.,1434931200,,100,4.9411764705882355
8626610,5,B00GS1O5J2,Great !!,1431388800,,8,3.5
