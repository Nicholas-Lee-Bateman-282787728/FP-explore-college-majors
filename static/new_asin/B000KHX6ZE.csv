2691226,5,B000KHX6ZE,"Armageddon 2006 wasn't the greatest PPV of the year, but it's worth buying just to see the 4-way Ladder Match. The Hardyz, MNM, London/Kendrick and Regal/Taylor put on one of the best matches I've ever seen. It must be seen to be believed. The Last Ride Match between Kennedy and Undertaker is also surprisingly good.",1173312000,2,317,4.781818181818182
2691227,3,B000KHX6ZE,"Armageddon ended the SmackDown year or 2006 in solid fashion as SmackDown once again delivered a solid PPV card.  It's become obvious that if you want professional wrestling & less ""sports entertainment"" these days...the place to look is at SmackDown!

Inferno Match: Kane vs. MVP - The match itself wasn't longer than 10 minutes but it did what it had to do to finish up the MVP storyline however I have to give them credit for actually setting someone's body part on fire instead of their arm or foot like the last two inferno matches were.  Thankfully, MVP didn't have a bad case of gas or else them flames would have been alot worse.

Ladder Match: WWE Tag Team Champions London & Kendrick vs. Regal & Taylor vs. Hardys vs. MNM - Without a doubt the match of the night.  We all know what the Hardys & MNM can do based on their past so mix that with the daredevil style London & Kendrick adapted along with the fact that Regal & Taylor didn't look out of place with their mat wrestling style as well.  And watch out for that SICK spot where Joey Mercury's face gets crushed.

Boogeyman vs. Miz - If you seen one Boogeyman match, you've seen them all however I had a guilty pleasure with this one since I can't stand The Miz.

United States Champion Chris Benoit vs. Chavo Guerrero - This is very similar to their Survivor Series match which again was very good and all the ""Eddie"" storyline references were slowly killed off a few weeks before this match so you don't have to worry about that.

Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms vs. Jimmy Wang Yang - The crowd was mostly dead for this one but again, this was another good solid match.

Last Ride Match: Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy - Back & forth match between these two and it was very similar to their previous series of match in which Mr. Kennedy held his own & actually gave the Undertaker a run for his money as well.  If the purpose of these series of matches was to make Kennedy look like a main eventer...it's purpose was well served.

Lingerie Contest: Kristal vs. Layla vs. Jillian vs. Ashley - The T&A segment of the show which ended with Big D. Johnson coming out as Santa Clause.  If you like women in skimpy clothes then this is for you but personally, I see this all the time on SmackDown so it's nothing special.

John Cena & Batista vs. King Booker & Finlay - I thought it was just me but based on other reviews, the chemistry just wasn't there between these four men in this tag match.  I mean, it wasn't horrible or boring but you could just tell that ""it"" factor that makes a great match wasn't here.

Bonus: Kane vs. Undertaker (Inferno Match) - This was the first one & really something to see as the ring surrounded by fire & the flames would push up whenever someone got closer to it. Again, really something to watch.  This match makes the MVP one look pathetic in comparison.  However, this match is available on two other DVD's as well so it may have been more intriguing to get the second inferno match on RAW before WrestleMania XV since that's the ""forgotten"" match that not alot of people remember.

In the end, compared to the other SmackDown PPV's of the past year, this was my least favorite but still it's something I would rent first & then judge from there.",1172275200,12,3249,4.430252100840336

2691231,4,B000KHX6ZE,"Inferno Match Kane vs MVP: I thought MVP would win this one since Kane has lost every other match to him. Kane wins though after MVP's backside is on fire. 6 out of 10

Tag Team championship Ladder match MNM vs Regal and Taylor vs the Hardys vs Paul London and Brian Kendrick: This is no doubt the funnest mainevent of the night. I wasn't gonna order the ppv due to the lame predictable mainevnt but this match alone is well worth it. There's a lot of bumps with one happening when Jeff Hardy messing up Joey Mercury's face by jumping on the ladder with it then slamming into Mercury's face. Mercury is then taken to the hospital and Nitro trys to win this one all alone and doesn't do that bad. Funny spots come when Regal and Taylor are afraid of climbing the ladder. The end comes when London knocks Matt Hardy off the ladder to grab the titles. 9 out of 10

Crusierwighet championship Gregory helms vs Jimmy Wang Yang: Not a bad match eventhough the WWE never ever really promotes there Cruiserweight matches. They certainly don't put over their wrestlers the way TNA puts of the X-Division. Gregory Helms was just champ so long because when does he ever actually defend the title. Most of his reighn he was just feuding with Matt Hardy in non-title matches. Anyway this isn't a bad match Yang coming close to winning but loses after Helms just rolls him up I think. 6 out of 10

U.S Championship Chris Benoit vs Chavo: I like both wrestlers but this feud just needs to end. No offense to Chavo but he's just not in Beniot's league. Plus this whole Vickie thing is just bad and she shouldn't be on tv as heel in the firsl place. These matches just show how much Beniot deserves bigger and better and that he should be the main face on Smackdown...not the overpushed Batista. Anyway end comes when Vicky distracts Beniot and he thinks about putting the sharpshooter on her. Chavo then rolls him up for the pin but Beniot reverses it into the sharpshooter for a quick tap-out by Chavo. Decent match but this feud still should've ended at the Survivor Series and hopefully it is over now. 7 out of 10

Last Ride match Undertaker vs Kennedy: Will Taker put over a talented up and coming star....nope he just puts over big untalented people like the Great Khali. Still though this an entertaining match even if the wrong guy won. Taker tombstones Kennedy on the Hearse and then puts him in the trunk and drives away with him after making his usual silly faces like rolling his eyes up in his head and sticking his tongue out. 8 out of 10

John Cena and Batista vs Booker T and Finley: This is the worse booked mainevent for a ppv in a long long time. The announches try to say we never saw Batista and Cena team up before but didn't they team up a few times on Smackdown against this duo already ?? So this match could've easily have been on Smackdown again. Is K-Fed a booker for the WWE as well ?? Anyway the wrong team predictably wins this one. I mean Batista and Cena are already World Champions, so did they really really need this win ?? This makes the 4th victory the over-pushed Cena has in one week!

2691233,4,B000KHX6ZE,"After one of the worst ppvs ever put on [December to Dismember] Armageddon 2006 turned out to be one of the best, if not THE best, Smackdown ppv of the year. Kane defeated MVP in the first Inferno Match out of the last 7 and a half years, a tag team championship match turned into a wild four way ladder match with the introduction of two new teams, Chris Benoit retained the US title once again, and Batista and John Cena teamed up for the first time ever to defeat Booker T and Finlay.

Inferno Match

Kane vs. MVP:

The only inferno match that I saw was Kane vs. The Undertaker in the very first one, so I really wanted to see what they would do here. The flames were high; some burst of flame went well over the top ropes. Both men use a lot of brawling and trying to stick the other's face into the flames, but they were limited in what they could do at the beginning of the match. At one point though Kane takes off a turnbuckle cover, lights it on fire, and tries to stick it in MVP's face! MVP also gets thrown off the tope rope and lands on the announce table, Kane follows and throws MVP into the flames and MVP's suit catches on fire! Kane wins. 8/10

WWE Tag Team Championships

Ladder Match

Paul London and Brian Kendrick [champions] vs. MNM vs. The Hardys vs. William Regal and Dave Taylor:

What a nice surprise this was! This was a pretty good match considering that five of these men had never been in a ladder match before. A lot of spots in this match, each more painful looking in the last. Jeff and Matt Hardy as usual shine in their death defying moves, crashing into ladders, and all eight men take some harsh punishment. At one moment Kendrick does a double stomp type move to Matt while Matt was lying on a ladder. At one point Joey Mercury looked to have legitimately broken his nose, he was pouring blood. At the end of the match both Matt Hardy and Paul London were on a ladder, but London knocked Hardy off and grabbed the belts and won. 9/10 [Great match, a nice surprise for a WWE ppv.]

The Miz vs. The Boogeyman:

The only good thing about this match is listening to JBL absolutely bury Miz throughout the entire match. Not much of ring work, Miz gets freaked out and The Boogeyman got the win. 3/10

United States Championship Match

Chris Benoit [champion] vs. Chavo Guerrero:

Really good match between these two, longer than their match at Survivor Series, at one point Benoit hit seven german suplexes in a row! Chavo did a lot of counter holds and managed to escape the sharpshooter several times. At the end of the match Vicki grabbed the US belt and forced Benoit to break a hold on Chavo. Benoit teased putting Vicki in the sharpshooter, but put it on Chavo instead and forced Chavo to tap out. 8.5/10

Crusierweight Championship Match

Gregory Helms [champion] vs. Jimmy Wang Yang:

Another great match between two of the best on Smackdown, a lot of good chain wrestling in the beginning and both men were great to watch. Both men get knocked out of the ring and continue to fight inside and outside as they continue to battle. At one point Helms hit a swinging neckbreaker from the top of the rope into the ring! Jimmy went for his finishing move but Helms ducked it and rolled up Jimmy out of nowhere and gets the pin. 8/10 [Could have been longer, but still a good match]

Last Ride Match

The Undertaker vs. Ken Kennedy:

Yet another good match for this ppv. Both men fight all over the arena with chairs, led pipes, and a huge moment as Taker nearly died! They fight near the ringside area and Kennedy uses a chair on Taker and throws him into the hearse, however Taker attacks Kennedy and both men fight on top of the Armageddon stage set that looked like a giant castle. Taker then is thrown off the set and crashes on the floor! They continue to fight and Taker fights back and busts Kennedy open with a chair and slams him on top of the roof of the hearse in a sick moment. Taker tombstones Kennedy and throws him into the hearse and drives outside to win the match. 9/10 [Brutal match, better than the first one two years ago]

Batista and John Cena vs. Booker T and Finlay:

What was this? This was not a good way to end the show. Both Cena and Batista looked bad, both messing up moves that shouldn't have been messed up. The match was short too, barely ten minutes long. Finlay's little friend makes an appearance but Finlay gets taken out with an awful looking suplex by Cena, and then Batista hits an awful looking Batista Bomb, much like the one he gave at Summerslam to Booker T, getting the win. 7/10

Armageddon 2006 is actually the best Smackdown ppv of the year, and a top contender of best ppv of the entire year out of all of them! The Inferno Match/Last Ride Match/US Championship Match/Ladder Match/and Crusierweight Championship match were all well worth it. Although the main event lacked a lot, fans of Batista and Cena will be happy. This is totally recommended, so buy it when it comes out on DVD!",1166313600,4,4971,4.387377584330794

ARMAGEDDON 2006

1.[INFERNO MATCH]KANE VS MVP-great opening match right here with fire surrounding the ring. There have only been a few Inferno matches so I always look forward to these. This was the match that was going to end the feud between these two. MVP looked good with the speed advantage but Kane controlled most of the match. When MVP would try to escape the ring he was granted his wish as Kane pushed him off the top rope to the outside. He then joined MVP with a flying forearm. Not long after Kane would set MVP's backside on fire.

2.[LADDER MATCH TAG TITLE]PAUL LONDON & BRIAN KENDRICK VS WILLIAM REGAL & DAVE TAYLOR VS MNM VS THE HARDY BOYZ-this match became a ladder match on the spot as Teddy Long made the announcement right before the match started. He would also add MNM and The Hardy's to the match as an additional Christmas gift to the fans. Any way this was an excellent match and very possibly the best match of the night. All four teams preformed to their best here and all looked good. This was also the match in which Joey Mercury got his nose broke after the ladder struck him in the face. That was the nastiest moment of the match but like any ladder match there are plenty of high spots. London and Kendrick keep the belts in a hard fought match.

3. THE MIZ VS THE BOOGEYMAN-the weakest match on the card but still I found it to be entertaining enough. I have always liked the Miz even then when he was still developing I wish the Boogeyman was still around. In fact he is one of my created characters on WWE 13, his character is cool but his matches were not the best thing out there. Any way this is a quick match that was putting The Boogeyman over as he ended Miz's undefeated streak.

4.[US TITLE]CHRIS BENOIT VS CHAVO GUERRERO-good match here despite what Benoit would go on to do. I know that has nothing to do with the match but any time he is mentioned it has to come up. I can't stand him or what he did but regardless this is a good match. Benoit gets the win.

5.[CRUISERWEIGHT TITLE]GREGORY HELMS VS JIMMY WANG YANG-we get another great match right here for the Cruiserweight title. Back and forth action like only the cruiserweights can deliver. There are plenty of great moments and high spots. Helms ends up keeping the belt in a really fun match.

6.[LAST RIDE MATCH]UNDERTAKER VS MR. KENNEDY-my favorite match of the night and the best in my opinion. The ladder match may be the most fun but this one tells a great story. Both guys are excellent here but it is Kennedy that looks strongest, makes sense they really wanted to push him, but of course taker is Taker and shines as well. The thing most remember is Taker being thrown from off of the top of the set. But to me the best part is when Kennedy is on his way to victory in the driver seat of the hearse and Taker raises up. The shot that they gave us is very horror movie like, I loved it. Moments later Taker would tombstone Kennedy on top of the vehicle and makes his way to a victory.

7. JOHN CENA & BATISTA VS KING BOOKER & FINLAY-this was a pretty good main event as the two top faces would go against two of my all time favorites. Batista and Cena obviously were the faces here and being the champs from each show were the favorites to win this. Booker and Finlay really make this match in my opinion controlling a lot of the match and of course cheating like any good heel would. Cena and Batista get the win after a Batista bomb on the king.

BONUS MATCH

8.[INFERNO MATCH]UNDERTAKER VS KANE-this was the very first inferno match from the twenty first In Your House PPV Unforgiven 1998. If you are a fan of wrestling I can only assume you have seen this match so you know how good it is. This was during one of the best periods for both of these men as this was such a fresh and great rivalry. Being the first of any kind match always adds something special. The action is great as both men brawl for most of it. I loved that Vader came back here during this match as he is one of my all time favorites. Then of course there is Taker diving over the flames onto both of them as the major highlight. Taker of course wins the match in one of the best matches on the disc, maybe the best and this is a bonus match.

Over all this was a good event and had some great matches on it. The fact that they added the first Inferno match as a bonus was an added bonus [see what I did there]. I would recommend this DVD to any wrestling fan out there as I think it is a good addition to any collection.",1368403200,,4512,4.242142025611176

8156901,4,B000KHX6ZE,"Most of the time, the Armageddon PPV is pretty routine, rarely claiming anything as anymore than OK.  This year's Armageddon was actually a very pleasant marvel.  Easily outshining the previous December to Dismember event, Armageddon 06 will most likely age pretty well.  Aside from one boring match, an underwhelming main event, and a stiff crowd- this PPV was strong.

Inferno Match
MVP vs. Kane:
Surprising that this was the opening match- it wasn't bad.  The pace was slow, and the match was short.  It did its job to end this tired storyline, with MVP being burned at the end.  I think we all knew Kane might win this match, but nonetheless, I think it did good things for MVP's career.  JBL's commentary was kind of annoying as well.

WWE Tag Title Fatal-4-Way Ladder Match
Paul London & Brian Kendrick vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. Hardys vs. MNM:
Now let's put this into proportion, we have 4 brilliant teams- each with very contrasting styles, some great innovation, and an overall incredible match of the year candidate!  As most probably know, Joey Mercury takes an incredibly sick shot to the face with one of the ladders.  I wish the match would have went longer (actually, should have went longer to boot the next match on the card).  Anyway, this is the best match on the card by far, and exceeds any other ladder match we've seen in a long time.  I would recommend the purchase of this event, just for this match.

The Miz vs. The Boogeyman:
As The Miz himself would say: ""really?""  I hated every second of this as the company managed to gather two of it's most annoying superstars and put them together.  It's a good thing the ladder match was as good as it was, because this is a seemingly huge halt in the road.  Skip, skip, skip.

United States Title
Chris Beniot vs. Chavo Guerrero w/ Vickie Guerrero:
So this was much better.  It was kind of funny to see Vickie with that neck brace, and compare her to how she is today.  The match was pretty strong, maybe not the technical display that both of these guys are capabale of putting on with one another, but good enough.  The ending hurts this slightly.  For those Chavo fans who like to see him not jobbing to the likes of Hornswoggle and Santino, take a look at this one as his talent is put to some use.

Cruiserweight Title
Gregory Helms vs. Jimmy Wang Yang:
This is the point in the show where the elements that were other than the match started to frustrate me.  JBL's commentary was absurd, and the crowd was completely dead.  They actually started to give a ""BORING"" chant about halfway through.  Sure, it wasn't a highflying display like most of their matches, but it had good story telling, and really belonged on the card.  Starts off kind of slow, but picks up, has soom nice spots, and a clean ending.

Last Ride Match
Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy:
Although not as good as the ladder match from earlier, this was the second best match on the card.  And don't let that fool you, because this was excellent.  It was much better than the inferno match.  There were plenty of hard hits, and some great appeal to the storyline.  There are also a lot of good surprise spots, with the action on the top of the stage.  The spot when Undertaker sits up in the back of the car is something genius as well.  I liked the booking as well as Kennedy looked good here with Taker.

I think after the Last Ride Match there was a lingerie contest involving Kristal, Layla, Jillian Hall, and Ashley.  The ladies are all hot, but WWE always seems to turn these segments into something gross.

John Cena & Batista vs. King Booker w/ Sharmell & Finlay:
The storyline here is that there is no storyline.  It's really just a random tag match thrown together and put into the main event.  I don't think I agree with this, I probably would rather have seen Batista vs. King Booker for 200th time than this.  It wasn't bad in terms of quality, but very pointless.  The WWE could have booked something much stronger to end this very solid PPV.

So in summing this one up, it was a good one.  The quality is there in all the matches, with only a few frustrating parts.  So if that is all we have to worry about, this turns out to be a great thing.  Look especially for the Ladder match and the Last Ride match, as both are candidates for match of the year to me.  A strong way to finish the year for WWE, and a good pay to redeem themselves after December to Dismember.",1298851200,,4427,4.443478260869565

8156903,5,B000KHX6ZE,"1. (Inferno Match)
MVP vs Kane:
A nice little gimmick match to end this feud. From a wrestling standpoint, it was mediocre, as the flaming ropes are limiting. But from an entertainment standpoint, it was good. Nice opener. 6.5/10

2. (WWE Tag Team Championship; Ladder Match)
The Hardyz vs Regal & Taylor vs MNM vs The Hooliganz:
What can I say? This surprise match made the PPV. Absolutely fantastic job on all 4 teams parts. Very good 25 minute match, with spots in between to always keep it exciting. Nearly perfect, and match of the night. 9.5/10

3. The Miz vs Boogeyman:
This is what they give us after our match of the year? Well, this is bad. A 2 minute squash, with no place on the PPV... or anywhere. 2/10

4. (United States Championship)
Chavo Guerrero vs Chris Benoit:
What is Chavo doing in a US title match? In any case, the match is okay. I expected more here, and I didn't get very much. For a TV bout, this would have been great. On PPV, just average. 7/10

5. (Cruiserweight Championship)
Jimmy Wang Yang vs Gregory Helms:
A solid match from these 2 cruiserweights. It's nice to see the cruisewights at least get a spot on the card. A bit slow to begin, but it picks up into a good match. When given time, the cruiserweights can shine. 7.5/10

6. (Last Ride Match)
Mr Kennedy vs Undertaker:
The finale of this otherwise uninteresting feud. I usually hate Kennedy's matches, but here I found him surprisingly entertaining. Undertaker was great as usual. A good 20 minutes, this match had some nice back and forth action, some sick spots, and a great ending. 8.5/10

7. King Booker & Finlay vs Batista & John Cena:
This is the main event? Uh! This was not worthy of headlining a PPV. TV maybe. A short, mediocre match. Nothing bad, but this is a PPV! Tag Team main events do not sell PPV's. They aren't very good either. 6/10

Overall: Some very good matches, a squash, a match of the year contender, and a mediocre main event sum this up. The undercard saves this one. Recommended, if only for the ladder match, which justifies the price alone. 7.5/10",1202342400,,2068,4.5133689839572195
8156904,5,B000KHX6ZE,"I have not yet bought the dvd for this PPV, But i had tickets to this show and i was there to see the entire show live and in person! I was in the Richmond Coliseum the night this event took place and i had the time of my life! It was about time WWE had a worthwhile PPV that came to Richmond, Va! This PPV was 10 times better than Survivor Series 2006 and 20 times better than December To Dismember [Which took place only 2 weeks before this and was undoubtedly the worst Pay-Per-View of the year]. The show was a lot better than it looks [Except for the lackluster main event, But the undercard more than makes up for that match]. Here's my opinion of the matches of this show:

1. Inferno Match
Kane Vs. MVP
This was not the greatest inferno match [That honor goes to Undertaker Vs. Kane from In Your House 22:Unforgiven, Which is an extra feature on this dvd], But it was a good way to open the show. It was a pretty decent match and it was pretty funny at the end when MVP's outfit caught on fire. Kane won. ***

2. 4-Way Ladder Match for the WWE World Tag Team Titles
Champions Paul London & Brian Kendrick Vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor Vs. The Hardy Boyz Vs. MNM
This was undoubtedly the highlight of the whole event and the most memorable thing that occurred in the entire night! Originally going to be another regular tag team title match, Teddy Long came out to the ring before the match and added The Hardy Boyz and MNM to the match and changed it to a 4-Way Ladder Match. The match was extremely exciting and reminds me of the old TLC matches The Hardy's used to have against Edge and Christian and The Dudley's. Everyone involved gave it their all and this just might be the match of the year for 2006! This was an epic match and this match made the whole show [No offense to the other matches, This one was simply just the best!]. This is a must-see match for any wrestling fan and this alone should make you wanna buy this dvd. Also, watch for the deadly accident where the ladder catapults into Mercury's face and actually crushes his nose [I was there to see this and believe me, Mercury had to leave the match because he was bleeding like crazy and it was real]! You will not be dissapointed in this match by any means! Through all this, London & Kendrick retained the titles. ***** [Best match of the night]

3. Boogeyman Vs. The Miz
A forgettable match that could've ruined the momentum of the whole show. Worst match of the night by far! *

4. For the WWE U.S. Title
Champion Chris Benoit [R.I.P.] Vs. Chavo Guererro
While this match was a little better than their Survivor Series match, This was another dissapointment from these two. The match's pacing was not good and a lot of the match was boring. This was not one of the better feuds of 2006. Both of these guys have done way better matches than this. It's just much too unfortunate Benoit ended his life the way he did. Benoit retains the title again. **1/2

5. For the WWE Cruiserweight title
Champion Gregory Helms Vs. Jimmy Wang Yang
This match was a nice, high-flying, action-packed match. For those who were still watching WCW in its final days of existence, You may be able to recognize that Jimmy Wang Yang is actually Yang from the Jung Dragons. Although i don't like his chinese redneck gimmick that he has now, Jimmy Wang Yang is actually a solid wrestler and he proves it in this match with the wonderful aerial moves and risky moves he did. This match had some wonderful back and forth cruiserweight action and was a very enjoyable match. Gregory Helms retained the title. ****

6. Last Ride Match
The Undertaker Vs. Mr. Kennedy
This was even better than their First Blood match from Survivor Series. The match was very entertaining throughout with solid action provided by both men and Mr. Kennedy surprisingly held his own against Undertaker. The ending of the match is the highlight of the entire match and this was another good match that occurred that night. Undertaker wins. ****

7. Lingerie Contest
Kristal Vs. Jillian Hall Vs. Layla Vs. Ashley
Boring! No Stars.

8. John Cena and Batista Vs. King Booker and Finlay
This could've easily taken place on an episode of Smackdown instead of this show. This is not a very good main event, But it's better than that Booker/Batista title match from Survivor Series. The 4 guys here have little chemistry. Booker and Finlay clearly outclass Cena and Batista in terms of wrestling ability. This match was ok, But was rather short for a Pay-Per-View main event. Cena and Batista won. **1/2

Not a bad way at all to end 2006. This was an awesome show in spite of a few weak spots. Wrestling fans should most definitely be satisfied with this show. Highly reccomended!",1188172800,,4706,4.469150174621653
8156905,5,B000KHX6ZE,"Without a doubt, Smackdown delivers the finest pay-per-view the year of 2006 had to offer. Every single match minus one was enjoyable (and even that dud match wasn't *so* bad), and all had amazing moments and most of them had you on the edge of your seats.

Here's my rundown of the matches on this amazing card:

01. Inferno Match: Kane vs. MVP

This was really short, but it served it's purpose - seeing MVP get burnt. Kane set his whole back on fire and watching him run around on fire was shocking. I don't like MVP, so I'm glad Kane won. The most annoying thing about this match was JBL's commentating, I wish that man would just shut up. (8/10)

02. WWE Tag Team Ladder Match: Paul London & Brian Kendrick (c) vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. MNM vs. The Hardyz

Amazing match! I loved how MNM and the Hardyz were added in at the last second and how it was made into a ladder match. All 4 team put on a good show, and the best moment was Jeff Hardy smashing a ladder into Joey Mercury's face - he broke his nose and there was blood everywhere. Paul London & Brian Kendrick picked up the win after Paul London got the belts. Very enjoyable match and one you can watch over and over because you always miss something. (10/10)

03. Boogeyman vs. The Miz

I forget if this was after the ladder match or not, but it doesn't matter because this was the dud of the night. I hate The Miz and he never looks good in the ring. I'm glad the Boogeyman beat him. Skip this, it's the only bad match on the card. (4/10 for the Boogeyman winning)

04. United States Championship Match: Chris Benoit vs. Chavo Guerrero

This was a pretty good match. Chris Benoit is an amazing wrestler, he always looks good in the ring. Chavo is annoying but he's pretty good too. Vickie Guerrero interfering in the match was pointless and unneeded as Chavo and Chris put on a good show on their own. Chris picks up the win deservedly. (8/10)

05. Cruiserweight Championship Match: Gregory Helms vs. Jimmy Wang Yang

I love Jimmy Wang Yang so I enjoyed this match, although he did lose. The Cruiserweights need more recognition, their high-flying antics are entertaining and they always put on a good match. Jimmy put on an amazing show with loads of risky moves, but Gregory picked up the win. (8/10)

06. Last Ride Match: Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy

I loved this match - absolutely amazing. The Undertaker is a legend and he can make anybody look good in a match, he carried Mr Kennedy very well. Kennedy put on a tremendous show though - especially when he threw the Undertaker off the set 20 feet down. The best bit of the match was when Kennedy was in the drivers seat of the hearse about to drive it out the ring and the Undertaker sat up behind him. It was like something out of a horror movie, and their facial expressions were priceless. The Undertker wins after a tombstone on the top of the hearse. (10/10)

At this point, the divas (Kristal, Jillian Hall, Layla & Ashley) participated in a lingerie contest with Ashley looking the best. LOL at JBL saying that Santa sucks, that was funny.

07. Batista & John Cena vs. King Booker & Finlay

What a dream team - Batista and John Cena on the same side. This was a great match - Batista and John had great chemistry and worked very well together. There were loads of great spots, like when Hornswoggle (Finlay's little sidekick) kicked himself in the head LOL. Batista and John pick up the win after Batista does a Batista Bomb on King Booker. My favourite moment was when John hugged Batista after the match was over, adorable. (10/10)

This was a very enjoyable and extremely entertaining PPV, and shows that Smackdown knows how to put on a good show. My highlight was the Last Ride match. The only bad bit was Boogeyman vs. The Miz and most of JBL's commentating because he would not shut up about MVP getting burned.",1181001600,4,3854,4.428571428571429
8156906,3,B000KHX6ZE,"If you're an avid WWE fan, you already know that this PPV showcased one of the greatest bonuses in pro wrestling history - an impromptu 4-Team Ladder Match with brutal results.  While I don't think ARMAGEDDON 2006 is an entirely successful PPV, there's more to enjoy than just that Ladder Match that surprised audiences around the world.  Plus, John Bradshaw Layfield kept my complete attention while doing his commentary.  If the matches didn't do the trick, the man's voice made up for it.

1) Inferno Match
M.V.P. v. Kane
---This type of match doesn't allow the wrestlers to do much, for the very simple reason that there's a Barrier Of Fire surrounding the ring (duh).  However, it's because of that real sense of danger that I forgive this most basic of slugfests.  The finish is kinda strange and anticlimatic in the ""dramatic sense"".  But then again, there's a friggin' ring of fire that could've easily hurt these two men.  By the way, JBL berating Teddy Long from the commentary table is hilarious!
""6.0 / 10"" (basic brawl, but that Inferno just worked for me)
------------------------------------------------------------

2) Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships
Paul London & Brian Kendrick (champions) v.
William Regal & Dave Taylor v. MNM v. The Hardys
---Let's keep this short, shall we?  I quote JBL, ""They're gonna be carrying them off like cartwood...""  This was a great bonus, filled with plenty of high spots.  Joey Mercury's smashed face (if you haven't yet seen it) is a gruesome sight.  Regal and Taylor clearly didn't quite belong in this match, but at least JBL and Michael Cole used that to enhance the TV presentation.  Even though I kinda wished this was just London/Kendrick against Regal/Taylor (the original advertised match), I can't ignore these 8 guys enduring an undoubtedly miserable experience.
""8.5 / 10""
------------------------------------------------------------

3) The Miz v. The Boogeyman
---I actually didn't think this was too shabby.  The Miz brought out the longest match in Boogeyman's WWE career to date, which not even JBL could do.  You don't need to rush to see this, of course.  But if you choose to watch it, I don't think it'll be a complete waste of time.
""5.0 / 10""
------------------------------------------------------------

4) United States Championship
Chavo Guerrero v. Chris Benoit (champion)
---Thankfully, much longer than their SURVIVOR SERIES encounter, which felt prematurely cut short by a vindictive backstage booker.  Sadly, this wasn't any better than the first time around.  I don't think it was the storyline's fault (remember that ""disgrace to Eddie's memory"" BS?).  I think my problem was that Benoit and Chavo were competing in a match that didn't seem to progress in either man's favor.  It was just a back-and-forth exchange of moves, but not much storytelling until the final minutes.
""6.5 / 10"" (Benoit and Chavo fans will get into this way more than I did.)
------------------------------------------------------------

5) Cruiserweight Championship
Jimmy Wang Yang v. Gregory Helms (champion)
---I apologize if I can't tell you much about the match, but I was a little distracted by other things.  JBL continued to be the PPV's biggest star, but this time, it was for the wrong reasons.  The crowd chanted ""BORING"" in a match that while slow-paced, wasn't the sleep-inducer they made it out to be.  JBL throughout the match continued to insult the fans for not giving Yang and Helms (two gifted performers) the respect he felt they deserved.  The match itself wasn't anything to brag about, but it wasn't the high-flying extravaganza that audiences expected from guys like Helms and Yang.  Okay match, great commentary, tough crowd.
""6.5 / 10""
------------------------------------------------------------

6) Last Ride Match
Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker
---One of the year's most pleasant surprise for me.  I hated and despised and loathed this rivalry.  Taker and Kennedy were awesome for the TV buildup, but come PPV time, they disappointed me beyond belief.  But on this night, they delivered an impressive fight that included just a lot of neat little touches.  They competed at ringside in vicious fashion.  They kept the brawl at a fast pace.  Kennedy and Taker fought atop the entrance stage (complete with an airbag spot).  There were even a few moments involving the Last Ride Hearse (the vehicle a superstar had to use to win the match, like a Stretcher Match).  A strong end to a rivalry that overstayed its welcome.
""8.0 / 10""
------------------------------------------------------------

7) Finlay & King Booker v.
John Cena (WWE champion) & Batista (World Heavyweight champion)
---Do I even need to comment?  Just look at this headline.  No titles on the line, and there wasn't much of a storyline to even put this on PPV, not to mention in the main event.  Well, if the match had been a strong display between four capable performers - and yes, Cena is ""capable"" - I wouldn't be so hard on this random Tag Team affair.  But as it turns out, this was a pointless 12-minute gathering of talent, which did nothing anybody's career.  None of these wrestlers gained or lost anything from ARMAGEDDON 2006.  I guess there are worse things that can happen to pro wrestlers.
""5.5 / 10""

ARMAGEDDON 2006 will always be made famous for its Ladder Match.  If that's the only reason you're checking this DVD out, I recommend you purchase the excellent WWE LADDER MATCH DVD from Spring 2007.  But if you're interested in the PPV itself, I suggest you take a pass unless you get a sweet deal on it.  You might like it, but not much from this PPV impacted the WWE in long run.",1177545600,2,5731,5.097639484978541
