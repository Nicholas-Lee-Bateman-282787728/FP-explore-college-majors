643295,5,6303443060,"""I am not one to complain; but, when I see these ridiculous prices for the VHS tapes of ""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" and ""It Happened At The World's Fair""; well then, what I cannot seem to understand is why Paramount and MGM just will not reissue these two movies on VHS and DVD. By not doing this, then they are depriving us of actually owning our very own copies of these two titles. They are the only two Elvis movies that I currently do NOT have in my collection/library at the moment. It seems so unfair NOT to be able to have them. If you are reading this, and you agree with me, then PLEASE speak up, and say something. After all- I am not the only Elvis fan in the world. I am almost
certain that others would enjoy them, too. Thank you.""",1015718400,19,740,4.181818181818182
643296,3,6303443060,"It was back to Hawaii in '62. The first trip was the result of disappointing box office returns for two consecutive *serious* (and impressive) films, yielding ""Blue Hawaii"" which made a fortune. The two consecutive follow-up films again showed a dramatic Presley and...""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" And more girls. And more and more songs. About four are pretty good. In fact, the late add-in ""Return To Sender"" was an instant Classic and the title tune was a groovy uptempo reading of a ""lost"" Coasters song. A slight, but smooth beat ballad, ""Because Of Love"", is delivered in a beautifully photographed sequence at a club. Director Norman Taurog should be commended for providing Elvis with professional lighting and staging. In short, ol' El looks like a million! There a many, many examples of Presley movie songs where he is forced to work in too much or too little light and with goofy characters mugging in his spotlight.
Apparently based on a teen novel ""Mister Will You Marry Me?"" this movie has much of the color and feeling of its' predecessor. Like BH the soundtrack contains too many ballads but unlike BH here they are poorly recorded. (Though the ""flat"" mix does lend to the seafaring atmosphere.).
Despite the obvious artistic dilemma this effort, like many in Elvis' movie catalogue, deserves a second chance. His acting his excellent throughout; by '62 he has become a relaxed actor, handling the light assignment with enthusiasm and intensity and as usual he elevates the proceedings. Unfortunately there are about four production numbers which should have been placed on the shelf - especially ""The Walls Have Ears"" entry. Though spirited, the Elvis' and Laurel Goodwins' dancing comes off a bit amateurish. It's just one of many spots which could have been deleted so as to reduce the 106 minute playing time.
Yes, it's for deep fans only. But that's not a negative comment!
[By the way, historians, check out the GoodTimes video ""Elvis - King Of Entertainment"" for a rare short interview with Elvis as he arrives at the airport in Hawaii, just prior to filming. Another GoodTimes video ""Elvis In The Movies"" contains the ""Girls! Girls!.."" trailor which includes a deleted scene with a nice moody ballad called ""I Don't Want To"" - one which *should* have been included!].",1015632000,,2286,4.971279373368146

643459,3,6303443060,"Released in 1962, Girls! Girls! Girls stars Elvis as a Hawaiian fishing guide/sailor who tries to find a way to buy the Westwind, a boat that he and his father built, after his employer decides to retire to Arizona. Meanwhile hes caught between two women: An insensitive club singer (Stella Stevens) and a sweet rich girl who pretends to be working class (Laurel Goodwin).

As my title blurb says, this is a run-of-the-mill Elvis flick, but its somewhat effective simply because its essentially a serious drama situated amongst the Hawaiian boating/fishing industry. Of course, Presley performs a song every 7-12 minutes. Stevens' role is rather small so the focus is on the protagonists romance with the secretly rich girl. Speaking of whom, two years later Goodwin played Yeoman Colt on the original (rejected) pilot episode of Star Trek, which was reworked into the two-part episode The Menagerie, premiering in November, 1966.

In a scene near the end where Elvis is rescuing the girl, theres a boat crash where a sailboat runs into a small motorboat. The stunt people (or actors) in the motorboat get hit by the sailboat and somewhat pushed under. Either the movie was so low budget that re-filming was out of the question or the filmmakers simply left it in because they knew it would get a reaction out of audience, some of whom may not be movie-savvy and assumed it was Elvis in the boat, which makes it all the more interesting.

The movie runs 106 minutes and was shot in Hawaii.

This is one of the highlights of the movie. Many times girls swarm around the sea captain because of his charm. One day a woman comes onto the pier wanting to take a boat out but the captain refuses to do this at first. A little later he gives in and they board the boat and the captain drives the boat. They have an affair which makes the girls angry with him, but at the end everything turns out alright. Elvis singing is rich and appealing in this movie.

643802,3,6303443060,"Elvis Presley is back in the Aloha State, as a fisherman with some big financial worries, in Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962), a film that despite its title, actually features just two women in major roles.  Laurel Goodwin makes her big screen debut as a woman from a wealthy family having trouble with finding a man she can trust, while sexy Stella Stevens stars as a lounge singer who has her own issues with men.

Presley play Ross Carpenter, a fisherman and tour boat operator, who suddenly finds himself in a bind, when his employer has to sell his fleet of four boats and move to Arizona for health reasons.  The ambitious and smooth talking Carpenter, makes a deal with Wesley Johnson (Jeremy Slate) the new owner of the fleet, to captain the Westwind, a boat that Carpenter built together with his father.  As captain of the Westwind, Ross gets a share of the profits made from fishing.  With the money, he hopes to eventually buy the Westwind.

Ross is in a club run by his pal Sam Anderson (Robert Strauss,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stalag-17/dp/6305678790/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stalag 17</a>), visiting with Robin Gauntner (Stevens), an old flame who is a lounge singer there, when Laurel Dodge (Goodwin) takes a fancy to him.  She follows him out onto the street, and eventually they begin a relationship.

When Ross' first fishing run proves not to be successful, he turns to singing in Anderson's club to supplement his income, which causes problems with both Laurel and Robin.  It turns that Laurel comes from a wealthy family, and with some help from her father, she buys the Westwind intending to give it to Ross, but his pride is won't allow him to accept.

A Chinese family headed by Benson Fong (Flower Drum Song) are Ross's closest friends.  Unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Hawaii/dp/6305837708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Hawaii</a>&nbsp;(1961) and Paradise Hawaiian Style (1966), besides the scenes featuring the harbor and ocean, local Hawaiian locations and the island lifestyle isn't really spotlighted to the same extent.  Musically, the big hit Return To Sender is well done, although the performances of some of the other songs is not that great.

For whatever reasons, the producers of the Presley films occasionally chose to feature an unknown actress as Elvis' leading lady.  Laurel Goodwin does a decent job here.  She's young, innocent looking, and sugary sweet, sometimes almost annoying so, but she would never again have a lead role in a major film.  Stella Stevens has the looks, talent, and fiery personality to make a good match with Elvis, but she's really underused, and not that convincing when pretending to sing.  Jeremy Slate's character turns out to be a bit of a wolf, although he does give Ross a chance, and takes rejection and defeat in stride.

It's slightly more serious than his other films set in Hawaii, and the story could probably have used some additional work, but Girls! Girls! Girls! is mostly the light kind of fluff that would soon become typical for Elvis Presley.",1319241600,,3137,5.265060240963855

643805,3,6303443060,"Girls! Girls! Girls! is a 1962 musical comedy film starring Elvis Presley as a penniless fisherman who loves his life on the sea and dreams of owning his own boat.

The film was shot on location in Hawaii.
 Nominated for Best Motion Picture - Musical at the 1963 ceremony. The winner that year was The Music Man. The soundtrack songs were recorded in March 1962 at the Radio Recorders Studios in Hollywood, California with the songs ""Where Do You Come From"" and ""I Don't Want To"" added to the music album released to coincide with the film's debut. The Leiber-Stoller title track was a hit for The Coasters in 1961 before being adapted for the Presley film. Besides the album itself, ""Return to Sender"" was released as a single and became a major hit for Elvis.
Several additional songs were recorded for the film and not released concurrently. This includes ""Plantation Rock"" which was not released until the 1980s (actor Rob Schneider himself a big Elvis fan, performed the song when he appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 1996), ""Mama"", which appeared on an early 1970s RCA Camden compilation and ""Dainty Little Moonbeams"" which appeared in the 1990s. The songs performed by Stella Stevens in the film have yet to be commercially released.",1236729600,2,1251,4.813953488372093

The uneven soundtrack includes two memorable songs from Otis Blackwell and Winfield Scott: the smash hit ""Return to Sender"" and the underrated ""We're Comin' in Loaded."" Amazingly enough, ""Girls!

643856,3,6303443060,"GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS! isn't one of Elvis Presley's most distinguished screen outings; but it provides a pleasant diversion nevertheless.

Set amongst the islands of Hawaii, Presley plays tuna-fisherman/tour-guide Ross Carpenter, trying to make ends meet so he can buy his dream boat and go into business for himself.  Adding complications is Carpenter's love triangle with two very different dames: jaded nightclub singer Robin (Stella Stevens), and young heiress Laurel (Laurel Goodwin), who's looking to experience life on the other side of the social divide.

Presley gets to sing no less than fourteen(!) musical numbers.  Laurel Goodwin (a snub-nosed Debbie Reynolds clone) is quite pretty but fails to make any lasting impression.  Producers really dropped a clanger in letting vivacious Stella Stevens go to waste in a thankless supporting role; she deserved better material here.  Stevens' singing was dubbed by Gilda Maiken.

With it's exotic location filming and the charm of Presley, GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS! will be a welcome title for fans, yet others will wonder what the fuss is all about.  The DVD offers no extra features.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).",1197676800,7,1168,5.444444444444445
643857,5,6303443060,"I like the way Elvis presents Mamma and Poppa Stavros and his Chinese friends as part of the American mosaic. But honestly, for some reason, I always thought this film was in Florida, not Hawaii as everyone else says. Maybe it was because I thought Mamma and Papa were Greek, like the Greeks in 'Beneath the Twelve Mile Reef' which was in Tarpon Springs,but the song 'We'll Be Together' that he sings at their party has a Spanish verse. I also like 'Earth Boy' which he sings with the Chinese children. As for the romantic ballads, I especially liked 'Where Do You Come From' but although it's part of the album, it isn't in the film.",1191283200,,634,4.474137931034483

643861,4,6303443060,"After reading these reviews that blast Elvis' movies as juvenile and ""hillbilly"", I had to respond.  I was raised on Elvis.  Real Elvis.  Not just the hype and media, but true stories and family memories as well.  There were several times Elvis shined - when he had good directors, and someone managed to keep Col. Tom busy and out of their way so they could make a decent movie.  I did notice and tip my hat to the gentleman who not only uses his real name but proves he is an educated viewer.  There were several things working against Elvis all of his life and to be able to rise above the crappy direction, cutesy additions and total lack of plotlines proves to me that he could have been so much greater than he was allowed to be.  Many of his movies were juvenile, I admit this, because it was true.  However, that wasn't his fault.  He had no control over that aspect of his life.  Watch more Elvis movies Mr. Viewer, and get a backbone while you're at it.  I recommend Wild in the Country and King Creole to start with.",1105142400,4,1027,4.296875
643862,1,6303443060,"Don't hesitate a moment before purchasing the classic ""Girls, Girls, Girls!"" Elvis, the King of Kings---the grand, high, exhalted, mystic ruler of all of Heaven and Earth, is superb. If only Laurence Olivier had his stage presence! If only Richard Burton had his voice! If only Clifton Webb had his acerbic wit! Yes, Elvis Presley was a thespian for the ages. The greatest actor who ever lived! Oh, how he filled the screen---especially in his latter years. In particular, his performance in the deeply touching, highly philosophical film ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" is one to be cherished by film and theatre aficionados of all ages, creeds, and cultures. What style! What grace! What announciation and articulation! Indeed, Elvis is every bit the equal of John Barrymore, Richard Mansfield, and John Gielgud in their prime. The only one of Elvis's sophisticated, allegorical performances that might possibly equal this remarkable spewing of dialogue is his masterful characterization in ""Tickle Me!"" Was the stage play for this literary masterpiece ever performed at the Old Vic? Of course, truth be told, Elvis was a phenomenal actor in every one of his matchless films---and to think that a guitar popped up in each one no matter what the setting or plot! Truly a miraculous performer. The man should have won at least a dozen Academy Awards as Best Actor. Who could ever forget the King uttering such romantic, poetic, tender phrases like ""Uh, huh."" No wonder all the women here at the Skunk Creek Geriatric Center find him so irresistable! I bow to his genius. A greater singer than Caruso! A greater actor than Olivier! A greater dancer than Astaire! I gotta go now...the guys in the white coats have gotten hold of me and are transporting me back to Happydale Sanitarium. Viva Elvis! My king! My hero! My God!",1064448000,3,1811,4.9605263157894735
643913,4,6303443060,"Elvis dared to be himself and changed the face of music and started a cultural revolution by doing so. The ""Viewer"" from Memphis,as he calls himself,doesn't even have the guts to use his real name in his own review. Elvis didn't make it on pure luck-he made it through something called talent and his own unique way of presenting it to the public.  There are many popular singers who didn't write their own songs and made more than their share of mediocre films. This did not detract from the fact that even in a film like ""Girls! Girls! Girls!, Elvis could still deliver the goods. He did the best he could do,and then some,with the material he was given and did it beautifully! I have probably viewed this film over a hundred times since its'first release,as I have all of Elvis'films,and have enjoyed each one of them immensely every time.

643917,5,6303443060,"I wonder if Elvis enjoyed doing ""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" because of Hawaii, where it was filmed, or becuase of all the gorgeous girls. This is a simple kind of film that's sort of lost its popularity over the years. ""Blue Hawaii"" has taken over. Elvis is a struggling fishing boat business owner who tries to hang on to a boat that belonged to his father. Good girl Laurel Goodwin tries to buy the boat back to Elvis. Meanwhile, Stella Stevens tries to make her move, but to no avail. I don't why she has to sing three songs in Elvis' movie. After all, the central character is him. But he wasn't greedy, and it didn't matter to him. Elvis fans, take the time out to see what Elvis loved the most.",1036800000,3,695,4.312977099236641
