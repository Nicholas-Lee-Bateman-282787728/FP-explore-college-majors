8585464,2,B00CRX5AJE,"Charlotte Gerson, daughter of Dr. Gerson, nervously tries to give some instruction for making some applesauce, cooked green beans, cooked califlower, toaster oven potato slices, and a few others. She initially makes some Enema coffee, but using her one big pot she seemed flustered and made excuses on why she could not make the Hippocrates soup that she just cut up the vegetables to make but then stops to set it all aside as the coffee was not done and she only had one large pot! She instead turns to making raw tomato sauce (in an ancient blender) while not using the garlic on the counter that was meant for the tomato sauce. She just talks about lists of ingredients one should use for Gerson Therapy diet, but instead of having a prepared list on a piece of cardstock to show on the screen or to actually give the short list of approved herbs she seemed again flustered as she could not list them but instead just says Oregano cannot be used. So left in the dark many times and  in the very poor quality picture film.
  There were many times the camera was out of focus or that Charlotte would have to go off screen saying she had to blow her nose as she was crying from cutting onions. Or stopped the film so she could go off and wipe her eyes after each time she cut the onions. Not well thought out production.
  It is like they had the idea to make some pointers but did not do anything but a few 10 minutes of prep, so the viewer is stuck watching her hack vegetables over and over.

  And the main 3 things that should have been covered: Making Hippocrates soup; making apple/carrot juices; and making Green Juice (for which she did not even have all the ingredients like endive, escarole, watercress, etc.) were somewhat started but never completed to view the final soup or revealing how to make the Potassium solution to add to the apple/carrot juices.
I did like the way she explained Yogurt and how to make cottage cheese from raw milk--but good luck on finding any raw milk in your area, as the FDA always seems to run those people out of business with raids.

 I mean really...you are making this 1 hr & 40minute film and you can't get enough pots or ingredients together to make the film worth watching???  And the lack of clarity...it was like watching through several layers of gauze.
  Then at the end it was really sad when she tried to lay out the few dishes she did make in the bowls like: beets with applesauce, carrot/apple sauce, and when showing the potato salad that had hardly anything left in the display bowl she comes out with something: ""well there isn't much left because someone must have gotten into it and ate it"".

  I did notice she had a huge rock on a ring on her left hand and I think all of the pigeons that have bought this useless film paid for it.

Much more information can be found in Charlotte's: ""Healing the Gerson Way"" BOOK for overall instruction and some food recipes for meals, or to go to the many Gerson Recipes online.

I would suggest that some of the food instruction from the quarterly Gerson Therapy Workshops be put together for a new video, and retire this mostly not useful, antiquated, overpriced DVD. Sorry Charlotte...nice idea, poor execution and does damage to your reputation to still have it out here to buy at over 20+ bucks.

I DO NOT recommend this film.",1393804800,7,3334,4.471947194719472
