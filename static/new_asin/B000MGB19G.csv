This DVD is a great showcase for his many, many talents.  His drumming is amazing all by itself but his original songs are well-done too.  He shines writing pop tunes (""Not Why Not"" and ""Teeth Go First"" should be on the radio) or prog-rock onslaughts with the amazing Mike Keneally and Bryan Beller.

This DVD is just amazing.  Buy it!",1393977600,,512,4.510869565217392
8168463,1,B000MGB19G,"If you are looking for a good INSTRUCTIONAL video, this is NOT the DVD for you. If you are only interested in watching Marco do his thing in his weird & quirky way, then by all means spend your money.",1207353600,2,200,4.025
8168464,5,B000MGB19G,"THIS is the best drum DVD out there. If you may even call it drum DVD. Marco  swings with the Buddy Rich big band, rocks his songs with Mike Keneally and even plays punk with an italian punk project----very entertaining indeed.

Also he shows how to apply his technique and his unique interdependence concept ( btw often copied or butchered in other releases) and how to use it musically, which I think is so cool. Good to see someone bringing drumming back to life.

Marco is not only a great innovative player, but also a great composer! I think this DVD is very important and will tie the drummerworld into new territories and perspectives.

Once again Marco shows that he's so far ahead....

I remember he once said in an interview: ""it is good to have the most insane technique or speed---but that still doesn't write the song!""

Thank you Marco for being an inspiration.",1179532800,2,876,4.619354838709677
8168465,5,B000MGB19G,"I just got this DVD and I can't get enough of it!!!This DVD has so much to offer. Marco plays some of his favorite Buddy Rich tunes with a live big band. Mike Keneally(guitar) & Brian Beller(bass)who use to play with Frank Zappa join Marco on some of his own compositions for some out of this world playing. Marco also breaks down & explains alot of what he does on his songs & solos. Great playing,entertaining,funny & informative. Do not let this one pass you by!!!!!",1171065600,2,469,4.465116279069767
