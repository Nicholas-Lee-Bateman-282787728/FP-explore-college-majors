8267764,5,B0017XCE3U,"I saw some not so great reviews about this movie and one of the main complaints being how this more about the fans than the celebrity themselves. These are the kinds of films I seek out! Without the fans, these people would be nowhere and the fans always have the most interesting stories. I run fan-culture.org and this movie will be reviewed on there in a future post.",1330905600,,370,4.455882352941177
8267765,1,B0017XCE3U,"I bought this dvd,and I am so disappointed on how this was done,I thought it would be much better than a bunch of crazed over weight Dolly fans runnung all over the place. I called New York ABC television once when they did the Dolly show on getting some items,and the guy told me (THAT SHIP SAILED ALONG TIME AGO). Also this dvd dosent show the real Dolly fan that had everything thing from the 60's that use to follow Dolly everywhere,and actually had the first fan club. Margo Dowdy,is the name. I do not understand who claims to know so much yet knows so little on the real Dolly Fan. Margo took awsome photos,and owned really rare items,she dyed at the age of 90,and everyone in Tazwell Virginia knew her for all the Dolly stuff she had. No one knows where or what happened to the rare collection. Id love to own it,for it was a treasure trove. Dolly knew Margo.",1230940800,2,867,4.3580246913580245
8267766,3,B0017XCE3U,This DVD is really for the fans and it doesn't show too much of Dolly. But it is very nice to watch anyway,1217376000,5,106,3.652173913043478
8267767,5,B0017XCE3U,"I saw this film at a Nashville film festival a few years ago. It really is amazing! I am a huge Dolly fan, but I pale in comparison to the folks featured in this movie. They put the ""fan"" in ""fanatic!""
  One Dollyite built a reproduction of Dolly's Tennessee Mountain Home in her backyard! Another couple has a vertual Dolly museum in their home, complete with dummies wearing real Dolly outfits. Another guy makes cross stitch images of Dolly on plastic fly swatters. Why didn't I think of that?
  This film is sweet and heartfelt. If you love Dolly, you will love this film. See it, see it, see it!
  (Spoiler:) My favorite part of this film features two Dolly fans who discover Dolly's long time assistant, Judy Ogle, had traded in her car (because one of them was stalking her.) They assumed the car dealership on her new car must have the trade in car. They were right. They went looking for the old car and found it! The two Dolly fans are featured in the old car sniffing around, finding strands of blond and red hairs! If that weren't enough, they found old car insurance cards assigned to both Judy Ogle and Dolly herself. They were in Dolly Nirvana!
  I reccomend this film to anyone who loves Dolly and pop culture! It's fantastic!",1215993600,7,1242,4.488888888888889

  The upcoming documentary on Dolly fans, For The Love Of Dolly, offers a unique window into the world of Dolly Parton fandom, tracing the lives of three sets of her most dedicated fans: why they love her, what drew them to her and the lengths to which they go to connect with her in person. The 56-minute production successfully weaves their personal histories via interviews and home movies with footage of their pilgrimages to that land of all-things-Dolly, Dollywood, in the Smoky Mountain city of Pigeon Forge, Tenn. Dolly herself makes several appearances throughout.

  The filmmakers have put together a revealing look into the lives of these fans: Harrell and Patric, a gay couple from Texas whose home is floor-to-ceiling Dolly memorabilia; Jeannette and Melisa, best friends from California and Nashville, respectively, who don creative Dolly-related costumes to chase Dolly down the parade route each year; and David, whose sister and parents say his adulation of Dolly is the primary reason for his success in leading a fairly normal life even though he is challenged by cerebral palsy.

  Several dozen fans were interviewed for the project over the course of more than a year, and I'm sure many of them will be quite disappointed that they don't appear in the finished version, but they will hopefully get over it. The only way to fully develop these characters for the audience to identify with and understand is to limit it to these few people. They could have easily done a full hour on each set of fans used in the film, but devoting nearly 20 minutes to each throughout the project is the absolute minimum for it to work. To add anyone else would have necessitated either turning it into an incoherent mish-mash where no one had adequate time to tell his or her story or expanding it to two or three hours, something not possible for such a small-budget independent documentary.

  The result is a compact yet comprehensive look into their lives, examining the neuroses and life situations which drew them to Dolly and the impact she has had on their being, most pointedly explained by Jeannette, who comments: ""It's like a drug. You've got to get your Dolly fix.""

  Stories of heartache from their personal lives contrast with moments of joy involving Dolly, as well as home movies offering endearing personal moments. Also look for one very surreal segment involving Jeannette and Melisa with a former possession of Dolly's best friend, Judy.

  Dolly makes several appearances, both in ""new"" footage shot for this project and also in several home movies provided by the subjects of the documentary.

  The film succeeds in pulling back a curtain into the lives of some of Dolly's biggest fans, exposing not only that they are quite fanatical about a celebrity but also attempting to explain to some degree what made them that way -- and perhaps showing how those qualities exist in all of us to some extent. On that level, the documentary should be on its way to acclaim as it makes the national and international film festival circuit rounds over the next year or two.

  The only part of the film I felt did not work was its opening, which finds each set of fans lining the Parkway in Pigeon Forge, preparing to see their star in her annual parade. It seemed a little disjointed as it jumped back and forth between characters who had yet to be introduced to the audience, and the tempo tended to drag as a result, making it feel much longer than the two minutes it took to watch. Viewers unfamiliar with the parade will likely spend the entire introduction wondering, ""What the hell is going on?"" Perhaps this was the filmmakers' intent, but I don't think it really draws the non-Dolly-fan viewer into the film, although the first segment afterward does. The only other change I would have made would have been to play snippets from some of their other fan interviews on the side of the screen during the closing credits instead of the audio from an original (non-Dolly) song -- I`ve seen this work quite well with other documentaries and feel it would have added another dimension to the project without taking away from its primary focus. Other than those two items, they have put together one stellar piece of filmmaking which should endure as an additional thread in Dolly's legacy.

2008 Addendum: The DVD version gives a little insight into some of the others who participated in the project with a 30-minute featurette including brief snippets from several dozen additional interviews, a handful of more extended fan profiles (of a drag queen inspired by Dolly, a British Dolly impersonator, a British woman with a Dolly room in her house, an African American singer whose hero is Dolly and a few others), a behind-the-scenes montage featuring the film crew and some of the friends they made during shooting, some extended footage from scenes which are in the documentary and more. (Even yours truly pops up in the featurette with a brief quote, a couple of photos in the behind-the-scenes montage and footage of Dolly feeding me a finger of banana pudding. )",1215734400,2,5164,4.854214123006834
8267769,5,B0017XCE3U,"I had the pleasure of meeting the Director and Producer of this film in 2001. Little did I know that I would be so connected to the project.  Over several years in the making, the finished product is an outstanding testament to Dolly and the love her fans have for her.  Rather than make fun of or bring out the oddity of such strong fandom, the documentary displays the love and compassion exchanged between Dolly and her fans.  Dolly appreciates her fans and they know it.  They in return gain strength, joy, and fulfillment from the experience she brings to them.
Viva la Dolly and may her light shine down on us for years to come.  And thank you Tai & Val for sharing this experience with the world!!",1215734400,2,704,4.426356589147287
