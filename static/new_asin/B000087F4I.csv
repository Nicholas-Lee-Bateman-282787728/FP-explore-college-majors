1828620,5,B000087F4I,"This is definately not your average horror flick.

Almost unbearable to watch but it will suck you in.

If you have the stomach to sit down for this one make sure your grandparents aren't in the room.

Most intense killer movies always turn away or ignore the real things that happen to a murderer's victims.

But in SCRAPBOOK Eric Stanze does not hesistate to keep the real horrorific things in place.

Buy this movie... just be careful who you show it to. i.e. your grandparents.

1828621,5,B000087F4I,"Image Entertainment has re-released another WICKED PIXEL CINEMA title uncut and with good special features. First, the movie SCRAPBOOK itself is a beautifully simplistic serial killer story with basically two characters: Leonard, the serial killer played by the late Tommy Biondo (ICE FROM THE SUN, SATISFACTION) and Clara, the victim played by EMILY HAACK (THE UNDERTOW, SAVAGE HARVEST 2:OCTOBER BLOOD). Both actors are brilliant in this movie. By keeping the movie simple, director ERIC STANZE (ICE FROM THE SUN, DEADWOOD PARK) is able to portray all of the torturous elements of kidnapping and torture, without pulling any punches. This movie made we cringe, wince, and shutter in terror, leaving me saying, ""I can't believe they put that in a movie."" Which, makes the movie one of the best serial killer, suspense, and horror movies I have seen in a long time.

The special features on this re-release aren't as extensive as the previous Wicked Pixel Cinema re-release of Ice From The Sun, but they did not disappoint. The commentary tracks are informative and the ""shower cam"" sequence was a nicely added, chilling surprise.

Although this movie is not for everyone, I highly recommend this movie to anybody looking for no-holds-barred brutality, done in a brilliantly simple style and design that leaves you breathless.",1130371200,6,1325,5.215962441314554

1828623,4,B000087F4I,"Eric Stanze's ""SCRAPBOOK"" is a great low-budget film that crushes the bounderies of reality horror! this movie is !SICK! & its definetely not for everyone! when this movie is over you truely question yourself weather or not you should have just watched it. now thats real horror! *YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*",1112572800,13,302,4.9411764705882355
1828624,3,B000087F4I,"I first read a review about 'Scrapbook' in Rue Morgue magazine.  After getting up the guts to finally buy it, I can say the hype from the article as well as the reviews on various websites does not prepare you for what you are about to watch.  This is a tough film to look at.  That being said, it is a better than average horror movie.  All the credit in the world belongs to Tommy Biondo and Emily Haack for really going all out.  The realistic mock-documentary feel to the movie makes the brutality that much more disturbing.  As a lifelong fan and collector of all kinds of horror movies, I enjoy and appreciate when a movie is capable of shocking me.  'Scrapbook' did it.  It is a very well done movie worthy of a place in any true horror fan's library.",1035676800,3,758,4.288732394366197

1828647,3,B000087F4I,"This film is similar to a car crash. You don't want to look but can't stop yourself.  This film is very uneven, but those with a morbid curiosity will find much reward in this underground shocker.",1208649600,,196,4.444444444444445
1828648,2,B000087F4I,"Basically what you have here is a director who seems incompetent and a writer without much skill. The actor/writer of the film is not doing this for anything other than his own depraved interests. Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of exploitation in my cinema, but this is utterly boring and self serving. I mean BORING. Even the 'rape' scenes were lame. By the end of the movie, you get the impression that Biondo and Stanze just wanted to treat a girl like a pig.

Pros: Brave Emily Haak. She gives it an extra star for her fearlessness.

Cons: cinematography, pacing, writing, editing, ACTING. There are more, I am sure.",1198713600,10,622,4.544642857142857
1828649,1,B000087F4I,"I love a good thriller, and i am all for some good old gore, but this flick was absurd. It had terrible actors, and was almost pornagraphic. I don't mind nudity in movies, and my son also like a good horror flick, but i would have died if i had let him watch this movie and he is 15. Nothing good about this movie at all. It barley got watched once and has been in hiding ever since. Dont wast your money on this movie, there a thousands of much better movies out there.",1164585600,7,470,4.01063829787234
1828650,1,B000087F4I,"Coming from a girl who loves ""Last House on the Left,"" ""Irreversible,"" & exploitation like ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" & ""Thriller: A Cruel Picture,"" I must say that Scrapbook was BAD! It actually crossed the line of cinematic fantasy, meaning you know its not real. Most pictures like this one, have an element of substance to them... like an actual story and plot. A plot where the action moves the story along. Not Scrapbook. It was just ugly for ugly sake. The actors & crew just wanted to shock. I guess it worked, and I recommend this for those who aren't shocked easily. But coming from a girl who loves her ""edgy"" movies, this one was just violent rubbish.",1159228800,15,660,4.508333333333334
1828651,1,B000087F4I,"I have to disagree with all the other reviewers here. ""Scrapbook"" is simply not a good film. It basically illustrates the abduction, humiliation, raping and terrorizing of a female. The main problem with the film, aside from its pointlessness is that the acting is extremely poor. The whole idea of the film is to witness the interaction of the victim and her abductor, but this is entirely undone by the lame acting. The direction is also very poor with continued use of static camera placements that only highlight the fact that these actors are unable to portray their characters. At no time is their any sense of terror properly demonstrated by the female actress and at no time is their any sense of malevolence demonstrated by the male actor. Had this film contained decent acting it truly would have been a horrific piece of cinema, as it is it is nothing more than a geek show.",1144195200,12,885,4.67948717948718
1828652,4,B000087F4I,"""Scrapbook"" is one of the movies from the ""Most Disturbing Films Ever Made"" list every gorehound supposedly should have.
Leonard is a lunatic who keeps Clara in his house, torments her, abuses sexually and emotionally, shoots everything he's doing to her on video and makes her write her thoughts down in a scrapbook which he considers to be some kind of a magnum opus.
Director Eric Stanze made this violent film not for violence's sake, that would be too simple and not interesting at all. He put a lot of effort creating an insight into maniac's mentality and mentality of his helpless victim who learns to manipulate her torturer through her suffering. That is what attracted me in the movie - this killer-victim relations. If it was not for them, the film, shot on video, would seem just another mindless amateur gore flick intended to sicken the audience and nothing more. And ""Scrapbook"" is indeed brutal and disturbing. It's full of blood, mayhem, naked bodies and torture. Emily Haack and Tommy Biondo (who unfortunately died without having seen the final cut of this work) act awesome, you totally believe them, they did a great job, it's because of them mainly the movie looks so realistic. Of course if you dedicated your life to the search of THE most disturbing film ever, ""Scrapbook"" is not the one. It really is one of them, but Fred Vogel's ""August Underground"" for example is by far more messy and gory and disgusting. And more clever I'd say although they both have pretty much the same plot.
But ""Scrapbook"" is not stupid, it's a good work, I think it found its own niche within the genre, so if you're a collector or just like disturbing films - this one is for you.
What's important, the edition has nice extras - ""making of"" featurette and interviews with cast and crew. That's a nice bonus that lets you relax after such a grim film and see guys who were doing it are not maniacs at all, but a bunch of very nice people. I had watched all the extras right after the movie itself and I should say I slept better at night than I think I would without them :)",1139097600,15,2080,4.564171122994653
1828653,5,B000087F4I,"This movie was in your face the entire time. I have never seen anything like it. Tommy Biondo did an amazing job as Leonard. Emily Haack is just amazing to have put herself in a role like this. I liked the realism of this flick, everyone always sugar coats things in their films, Eric Stanze DID NOT. It is diffently different from anything you will ever see!",1130889600,6,359,4.373134328358209
1828654,5,B000087F4I,"It's not everyday that you see a horror flick like this.  I read about this a while ago in Rue Morgue magazine and when I saw it for sale at Borders, I thought I'd check it out.  I usually don't plop down my cash on a DVD for a flick I haven't seen, but I've heard so much about this flick that I decided to take a chance on it.  Holy crap! It wasn't anything like I'm used to seeing.  It's not the kind of horror film you see down at the multiplex.  It's very raw and very brutal, and at the same time, I appreciate it for being so uncompromising.

The visual style of the movie was quite restrained.  It almost felt like a documentary, which made the violence even more agonizing to watch.  Not only that, I thought the performances by Emily Haack (also in THE UNDERTOW, another cool indie horror flick) and Tommy Biondo (who sadly passed away back in 1999, according to the IMDb) were simply amazing.  The bulk of the movie is focused on these two, and they carry the show with ease with their natural and uncompromising performances.

I can see why people would have a problem watching this.  Like I said, this isn't the usual kind of horror film that most people are prone to see.  If you have a stomach for the strong stuff, give this one a shot.  Kudos to Wicked Pixel for having the balls to make a film like this.  I hope to see more of their films in the future.",1130544000,6,1372,4.187022900763359

7979723,1,B000087F4I,"I'm up for all kinds of things.  I love B horror, the 'grindhouse' genre, and the like as long as it doesn't take itself too seriously.  This was honestly painful to watch. It is hard to say something along the lines of ""the shock went too far"" because frankly shocking elements in the film are in other films, the delivery and the approach though have nothing 'fun' in that B movie sort of way. This is not an exploitation film in the ""Hobo with a shotgun"", ""Kiss me Killer"", ""I Spit on you grave"", ""etc. sort of way.  It is the raw, bloody, humiliating, abuse, and rape of a woman viewed from a voyeuristic perspective for over an hour and a half that verges on rape pornography. It is disjointed, and IMO has no redeeming qualities.  I want my digital rental $ back.",1368403200,,769,4.356643356643357

The concept is interesting although it's a shame the writing and the acting are not up to par. I was expecting to see ""reality"" horror i.e. 'Irriversable' or even 'A Serbian Film' but I only ended up bored out of my mind and even fast forwarding through several dull scenes.
