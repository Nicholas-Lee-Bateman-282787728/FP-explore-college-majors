7071076,5,B00UT57BFS,"These 1995-1997 TV-movies do NOT look twenty years old...
Looks like they were filmed YESTERDAY! Buy these collections, in which, James Garner reprises his, beloved, Rockford character.
His---real life---brother reappears as the captain, along with many familiar faces from OUR memories of the past.
Rest In Peace Mister James Garner (1928-2014[86]).

3.-) I put The DVD over-wrap covers together with Volume One facing outward. The Second one is facing inwards.
Saves shelf space, and the original cases were those eco-friendly, easily ""recycled""---bah!---floppy cases anyway.

7071079,5,B00UT57BFS,"James Garner has long been one of m favorite actors. While the original series was on tv, was also one of my favorites.
I read that he had never taken acting lessons and never felt like he was a good actor. That being said, he did an awesome job in my opinion.
In these movies, his character is aging, but he still maintains the Rockford image.
His humor, flawed human, yet extremely sensitive sides still comes through.
His partner in CRIME, on occasion, and partner in help on others, remains side-splitingly hilarious. All and all, a great entertaining DVD. It will be well worth the purchase, especially if you enjoyed the original series.",1433203200,13,643,4.699115044247788

This set just like the first set of 4 movies finds an older James Rockford. He is still getting into trouble with the local police department, but he has slowed down a bit as the actor is older now. He seems to old for the love interests but, it's part of the story I guess. As far as the movies go, they are top notch. If you are a fan of the old Rockford this is not it, this is a Rockford that has changed ********Spoiler Alert****** Noah Berry is dead, so no more Rocky, *****Spoiler Alert Over******  and one can see the age on James Garner. Is he too old for the part, I don't know. I enjoyed the movies, I wished he had done more. I know he ended the original series due to injuries while performing his own stunts. He does not do too many stunts anymore in these movies. If you like the Rockford Files and are willing to overlook the age, these are great movies in their own rite, you should check them out.

7071117,4,B00UT57BFS,"Have always liked the 70's classic, ""The Rockford Files"" starring James Garner as wrongly convicted/pardoned ex-con turned P.I. Jim Rockford.  When these follow on movies were broadcast I never caught them so was grateful to see them now available in DVD.  This is the second set of films and the final appearance of Garner and his cast of regulars in these roles.  As soon as the familiar Mike Post theme music cranks up and you see the brown Firebird rolling through the L.A. streets it will take you back 40 years.  Unlike the original series which still holds up pretty well some of these movies are a bit melodramatic and hokey.  Garner had to be in his 70's at this point and while they don't have him doing crazy stunts there are some groan-worthy moments.  Stuart Margolin is back as sleaze ball Angel Martin and reliable Joe Santos as police pal Lt. Becker among a number of others.  Still, nostalgia worthy if you were a fan of the series or Garner in general.",1465603200,4,970,4.572254335260116

As a big fan of both Rockford and James Garner it was good to spend time following Rockford in  previously unseen adventure stories again. I must confess when watching the series in the 1970's I always thought it was a good cops and robbers show and rather naively never picked up on the social comment in each show.

7071131,4,B00UT57BFS,"A very mixed bag. Like the last several Columbo TV movies, the writers of the Rockford movies had to work past some clunky plotting and sentimentalized characterizations before getting Jimbo back on track. Friends and Foul Play was the best of the lot (close second: Godfather Knows Best), with a great plot as the title suggests among Jim's Paradise Cove circle mixed with typically unhinged Rockfordian gangsters plying their unusual trade, the interference of the welcoming returning Marcia Strassman as a criminology prof with fumbling students tripping over the case, and a surprising twist that underscores the theme of senior melancholy present in the TV movies. Murder and Misdemeanors is also acceptable Rockford-style cops and crooks hijinks, but If It Bleeds...It Leads might as well have been an old-school Lifetime/network issue of the week soaper, despite Rita Moreno's welcome return as Rita Kapkovic. Like Columbo, though, any Rockford is far, far better than no Rockford or most other more recent TV P.I.s.",1451865600,,1023,5.320987654320987

7071146,2,B00UT57BFS,"The first two movies were terrible. Actually shut off the first one after 20 minutes. Second one was complete junk. I was counting the minutes until it was over. Awful story, out of character characters, Rockford is pissed off throughout the entire episode, Idiotic sequences cold war style negative russian stereotypes, shoddy camera work, etc... I wish I hadn't seen it.

The third was watchable with John Amos and a convoluted plot you have grown to expect from a rockford files, but I have no plans to watch it again(unlike the original series 1-6 which can be watched over and over again).

The fourth tv movie was another long drawn out miserable experience. Hal Linden was a welcome sight, however the episode, a scathing indictment of the local media(while giving AP-American propaganda a free pass) has very little Rockford and he is a complete failure as is the pathetic hooker rita moreno(maybe my least favorite character from the series). I lost interest in it within a minute or two and just let it play while I did some work around the house.

Also I must say the quality of the dvd is pretty poor. Compared to the rather pristine original series, this is compressed with artifacts, no special features, just a low quality presentation overall.",1440979200,,1259,4.846511627906977

Picking up several years after the end of the series, these movies find Jim still living in a trailer (albeit somewhat larger than on the show) on the beach in Malibu.  With his trademark wit and style, James Garner makes the character seem ever-young, even as he complains about sore knees, a bad back, etc.

The final episode/movie in this set (""If It Bleeds, It Leads"") is incredibly well done but so unbelievably dark it almost made me regret watching it.  All four movies are so good--well-written, superbly acted--that I have to give this set five stars.

7071170,5,B00UT57BFS,"Finally, all the Episodes, missed the movies when they ran on TV back in the day. James Rockford aka James Garner was great, all the episodes especially with Angel Evelyn Martin Stuie Margolin. Gandy Issac Hayes, lots of great young actors in the show during the series Tom Selleck. Great car chases, locations. Seeing James Garner gimp around made it more real. James Garner will be missed.

8708259,5,B00UT57BFS,"My buddy, Jim Rockford is home, at last.

When I was very young, there were 2 shows I watched; the Mary Tyler Moore Show, and the Rockford Files. These 2 shows have a lot in common; they're both very well-crafted - written, acted, and shot by very talented people both in front and behind the cameras. Another important quality, is the characters are so wonderfully honed, I I know I'm not the only person who feels like these are friends we're watching.

I have all the Rockford's (and MTM shows, as well), and I'm one of the few who never saw these movies when they first aired, so finding them, and hearing about them only made me want to add these to my collection.

As another reviewer said, the quality of these is superb, especially as so many tv films and a bunch of series are not cared for in their digital transfer, seeing Jim and all the rest so crisp, colourful and clear is wonderful.

I usually curl up at bedtime, and watch an episode or two of the series, now with these (2; I've got both, vols. 1&2), I'm watching them slowly (1/week). In a way, it's like it was when the 'big 3' networks had the Movie of The Week - I'm so  happy to have 'jimbo' to watch.

If you're a fancu highly recommend the movies, and if you've never seen Jim Rockford before but want to see a iconic tv character in well-crafted moviescu highly recommend the Rockford Files movies, as well as the series.",1522195200,,1397,4.3538461538461535
8708260,5,B00UT57BFS,"Perfect complement to Volume 1.  James Garner looks and gets around exactly as you'd expect an aging PI would, and the characters are aging too.  Added an element of realism for me.  Plot in the final movie, directed by ""Angel"", was more preachy than the usual Rockford fare but I thought it had interesting parallels to today's internet bullying.",1519862400,,347,4.8474576271186445

8708264,5,B00UT57BFS,"James Rockford is a fine, modern-day hero.  James Garner's acting is thoroughly believable and first rate.  Rockford has values by which he lives and is willing to die.  He's willing to fight for and sacrifice for his friends and to stand up for the helpless.  He never asks, ""What's in it for me?""  In the all too grey world of confused values, celebrate someone you wish lived next door as your best friend and neighbor!  This DVD set, as the first one of four earlier Rockford movies, is worth three times the price.",1516665600,,519,4.526881720430108
8708265,3,B00UT57BFS,There were 2 movies on the disk as expected.  The first one was great and in The Rockford tradition but the second one was horrible.  Pedophiles and suicide are not the norm for Rockford Files.,1515542400,,193,4.485714285714286
