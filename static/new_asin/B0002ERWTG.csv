2081474,2,B0002ERWTG,"I found this film to be of a poor quality. The acting, particually that of Jesus was embarrasing and the plotline could have been more biblical and intriguing. I was very disapointed. Jesus was portrayed a bit too effeminately for my liking.",1110844800,7,241,4.761904761904762
2081475,4,B0002ERWTG,"I liked this made-for-TV picture.  It humanizes Judas by showing what might have motivated him.  The fact that Jesus is not the central figure in the story as presented actually allows the actor portraying him to loosen up compared to other actors in the role.  (That's what I liked about Jeremy Sisto in the 2000 miniseries ""Jesus"".)",1103241600,7,334,4.824561403508772
2081476,3,B0002ERWTG,"Long considered the necessary scapegoat in the crucifixion of Christ, Judas Iscariot has remained a mystery in many ways.  If he was ""predestined"" to be the one who betrays Jesus, why did it make sense for him to be the one?  As portrayed in this movie, Judas was a militant, one who wanted power and glory in his quest to liberate the Jews from the Romans power.  He was also jealous of Jesus' love for anyone else, and his despair as necessary as Jesus' execution.

Johnathon Schaech has the brooding sensitivity to adequately bring his role to life; Jonathan Scarfe as Jesus is a little too Scandinavian to be convincing in appearance, yet he delivers his lines earnestly and with religious fervor; Tim Matheson seems a little too ""Hollywood"" in his portrayal of Pilate.

Filmed in a brief time and on a shoestring budget, ""Judas"" received attention after the phenomenal success of ""The Passion of the Christ.""  It is a more sanitized version of the story of Jesus, but its lack of strong graphic violence will make it a must for those who felt Gibson's Passion was too passionate.",1097107200,12,1084,4.708994708994709
2081477,4,B0002ERWTG,"I liked it. It explores why Judas might have joined Jesus's group, yet never entirely understood what Jesus was trying to do. There are a lot of people who will use religion for political reasons, and in this movie, that's what Judas is doing. The Romans, Herod, and the high priest are corrupt, and Judas figures Jesus would make a perfect political leader -- except that's not at all what Jesus is trying to do. To be fair, none of Jesus's students at the time understood that Jesus had no intention of being a political leader; and many of them today still don't.",1095292800,6,566,4.504854368932039
2081478,4,B0002ERWTG,"This film gives an ""alternate possibility"" for the eternal life of Judas, after he betrayed the Lord and hung himself on the tree, and though there are many scriptural inaccuracies, the film is always reverent in its portrayal of Jesus, and shows him as strong, and knowing His destiny. Jonathan Scarfe is appealing in the part, and in appearance is light-haired and somewhat like a Durer painting of Christ.
As Judas, Jonathon Schaech has a forceful personality and swarthy good looks, and gives us a Judas that above all wants temporal power, has little understanding of the true kingdom of God, and is hostile to anything that doesn't include the expulsion by force of the Romans out of Judea.

Pontius Pilate (Tim Matheson) is played as a weak bumbler whose greatest dread is being transferred to Albania because of his ineffectiveness. He also has trouble taking his paws off his skimpily clad wife, Claudia Procles. Claudia (Fiona Glascott in a high camp performance) is a bossy little wench with an annoying voice, and seems to know more about the laws and how to implement them than the men in charge, reminding me of the TV ads where the woman tells the idiot guys where it's at.
Others in the cast of note are Owen Teal as Flavius and Bob Gunton as Caiaphas.

Filmed in 2001, this sat on the shelf until the interest in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" spurred the executives at ABC Television to give this a chance, and it was aired in March of 2004.
Shot on location in Morocco, it has some nice cinematography by Michael Goi, and a lovely score by Bill Conti; the writing credits go to Executive Producer Tom Fontana (from the sharp and critically acclaimed series ""Homicide: Life on the Streets""), and has some distinctly unbiblical language. It was directed by Charles Robert Carner on a very low budget ($ 5 million) and limited time (23 days), and all this considered, it is an entertaining, and occasionally moving film.
I have to confess that I didn't care for it much the first time I saw it, but subsequent viewings gave me more appreciation of it.
The message it imparts according to Paulist Productions is that ""It's never too late to turn back to God"".
Total running time is 120 minutes.",1093737600,25,2219,4.687179487179487
2081479,5,B0002ERWTG,"I saw this movie on TV several years ago and was convinced that he was not a traitor but was a Patriot who expected Jesus to be the leader to lead the people of Israel out from bondage under the Roman Tyranny.
I'm sure anyone who views this movie will get the same feeling.",1399939200,,273,4.074074074074074
2081480,2,B0002ERWTG,"I usually do not review a product exceedingly harshly, but this time I will make an exception.  I own many of the movies about the life of Christ; so I was interested about how they would handle Judas.  The movie did set forth an idea as in a few other movies of his wanting to overthrow the Romans (as many did); and felt Jesus was the answer (as many did).  The storyline is not in question.
  But the acting was terrible, the movie was completely jumbled from scene to scene.  They have a disciple raising a person from the dead before Jesus raises Lazurus.  All of the disciples were portrayed as idiots listening to all radical points of view and totally oblivious to Jesus's mission.  Some of them at one point took up the idea that they were to overthrow Rome AFTER they had followed Christ for quite awhile.  They were like kids.  And last but not least; I am open to recent movies that use today's vernacular; to make the story of Jesus more reachable to today's viewers.  But this was a bit much.  I thought they were going to ""high-five"" any moment and say, ""Yeah; we're cool.""  There is a difference between the Living Bible's contemporary wording and a movie script that screams ""Cult Classic"".
  This had Judas plainly  talking to Christ and all of the disciples about war against the Romans; Never even considering Jesus's real  mission and being corrected by them rarely-even being presented as some kind of power play between he and Jesus.  In any case; I would have liked to see this movie presented in a better way i.e., a totally different script, better acting, and maybe Judas not trying to be the leader to the mindless apostles; AND with the character of Jesus being played as the driving force he was, as opposed to a kind of jelly fish.  I am sorry; that is the only way I can describe it.
  In all; I would not advise people not to buy it if they want to experience it.  But do not expect an epic or even a depiction of the Biblical Jesus and apostles because it is not there.  It is almost laughable.",1397520000,2,2028,4.421621621621622
2081481,5,B0002ERWTG,A nice look at Judas Iscariot. It show his dots. I believe Judas is the most mistundersted person in the Bible. II don't believe he was a rat fink just misunderstood It would scare me back in the day to be called a judas. Now as a man I feel strong.,1373328000,,249,3.9019607843137254
2081482,3,B0002ERWTG,"The movie is okay; but there are some wrongs in the movie regarding cultural habits. Also I think that some of the characters senteces are too modern, but the plot is good.",1372636800,2,172,4.40625
2081483,5,B0002ERWTG,"SPOILER ALERT! My comments pertain primarily to the ending of this movie so I'd recommend NOT reading past this point if you haven't already seen it. As with most movies, there were some scenes that I liked more than others. But rather than dwell on the ones I didn't like, I'm choosing instead to reflect positively on my favorite scene, this being the last one. The image I recall is one where a couple of Jesus' apostles were praying over the lifeless body of Judas who had committed the final act in the drama of fleeing from the realities of mortal existence. Something was spoken about their prayers being in accordance with what Jesus would want them to do. And then as the praying voices of these devotedly loyal apostles gradually fades into the shadow-kissed corners of the smoothly transitionalized soundstage, the voice of the Master Himself fades in until the perceived volume of Jesus' voice praying in unison with the apostles goes from being equally mixed with them to being the only one reciting this prayer to the end followed only by a momentary pause filled with the lingering void of dead silence (part of my emphasis here is on my recollection of the absence in this scene of an irrelevant musical score or any other artificially contrived elements of sound design). This was more than just a passionately powerful method of using an audio track to creatively suggest that Jesus had magnificently triumphed over physical death just as He had said He would (since only the Living Spirit of a Crucifixion-Conquering Jesus would be praying WITH these apostles at this moment in the sequence of events being portrayed). For me, this scene was also a gentle reminder that the Timeless Truths Jesus eloquently expressed through His love-dominated actions and words are just as supremely relevant and important today as the faith-fact of His morontia resurrection three days after an unsuccessful legal attempt was made to shut Him up using a handful of rusty old nails and a trembling tree of torture.",1331251200,2,2017,4.88338192419825
2081484,1,B0002ERWTG,"Having characters in a biblical film use terms like ""okay"" and ""I sorta lost my temper,"" just doesn't cut it. The actor playing Jesus sounded like he should have been hanging ten on the waves at Malibu, not leading throngs of new believers. The title character faired no better. Very bad casting. You might remember him from ""That Thing You Do"" (a good film worth your time). Oh, one more thing, Tim Matheson as Pontius Pilate, enough said about this film.",1317168000,,456,4.6419753086419755
2081485,5,B0002ERWTG,"This movie is definitely one of my favorites.  Even thou it's not 100% all bible based on Jesus or Judas... it's STILL a GREAT story.  It goes around the time of Christ, and shows how a man that walked with Jesus, learned from Jesus, and saw all the medicals Jesus did, could later still betray him.
Like I said, it's not 100% all true, but at the same time, it uses the Bible as a foundation to the whole story.  We actually know little about Judas from the Bible.  But with facts about the culture and how people of that time acted, it's possible.
I love the way they made Jesus so, REAL!  He seemed VERY approachable.  And there is a part that Judas and Jesus pray wrestle.  WOW, I thought that was sooo cool.  There were some parts that Jesus looked at Judas, with so much hurt and pain, in his eyes, and how Judas just couldn't get it!
I am so glad I own this movie.  I saw it years ago, and have always wanted it!
Jesus Loves you, and no matter WHAT is going on in your life, if you turn your live to HIS control, it can be worked out in the end.  Jesus has changed my life, and I know he can change yours (for the better).  Plus, we are not here on earth forever.  You have to think about the next!  That is where it ALL counts.
Buy the movie!",1286668800,2,1250,4.032520325203252
2081486,2,B0002ERWTG,"Okay, while not the world's most devout Christian, this reviewer received strict Lutheran scholastic instruction for 10 years, and you know what they say about your formative years.  Let's sum this up quickly from the point of view of one of the alleged ""target audience"" members:  This is the ""Johnny Schaech show"", not unlike every other movie he has too large a part in.  One of the luckiest pretty boys in the recent crop of hot young actors, he's okay in supporting roles like That Thing You Do, simply because he can't act his way out of a wet paper bag with a gaping hole in it.  He certainly proves that in this movie.

The writing of this film is a Biblical abomination, and the portrayal of Judas as having been against Christ all along isn't even close to the truth.  I don't know what's more annoying; Jesus being portrayed as a pouting metro who looks like anyone shouting at him will make him cry like a five year-old, or Judas Johnny shouting orders at him all the time.  My favorite part is when he tells Jesus he doesn't want to hear anymore about his Father, and he'd better do what he says.  Hmm, that's really some great writing there.  You're going to boss around a man you've seen heal lepers and raise the dead?  I DID think it was funny when he was out stalling for time while Andrew was in a dead woman's tomb alone and raised her from the dead with the Lord's Prayer, though.

Yeah, there's another point of contention:  Why do they show very few miracles, yet talk about them endlessly.  This movie wouldn't make a convert of a fallen priest, much less someone who has never heard these stories before.  I dislike highly when filmmakers mess with Bible stories to this degree, yet I love the Story of Ruth (The 1960 version with Elana Eden and Tom Tryon.), though most of it is pure fancy.  Why?  Because it is compatible with scripture.

In the meantime, if you love scowling, head shaking, and bad acting on a wide-scale level, the ""Johnny Schaech show"" is your dream come true.  Somebody else here has already suggested the accurate, well-acted, phenominally directed, and truthful film, Jesus of Nazareth.  It's long, but it is excellent.",1187481600,2,2169,4.572538860103627
2081487,5,B0002ERWTG,"The film JUDAS has a well-written screenplay by Tom Fontana which weaves together the theme of Judas (Johnathon Schaech)as the voice of power and violence and Jesus (Jonathon Scarfe)of love and peace. The pacifist side of Jesus is often scorned in our day and many people are not ready to believe in a humble Jesus. It is unlikely in Biblical times that Judas could speak to a person of the high priest status, but such a talk would seem reasonable today.  This is a story that fits our colloquial English and modern sensibilities.

The gospels don't fully explain why Judas betrays Jesus, so the imaginative tale of Judas' mother who needs a funeral, fills the gap. The music underscores the power of God in scenes such as, when Jesus pays a poor man's taxes and then asks Mathew, the tax collector, to follow Him. Background information is explained by the expanded role of Pilate's wife. Why Judas had to identify Jesus, was imagined to be because the centurion, named Flavius, could not identify Him because he had been arrested for refusing to capture Jesus. The film makes parts of the Bible come alive as for example, when the disciples gained the ability to go two-by-two to heal. This is often omitted from stories about Jesus because it is difficult to dramatize. Using low tech camera tricks instead of computer graphics, made the healing seem more real to me. Judas suggestion that the disciples pay for their ministry by highway robbery, adds poignancy  to Jesus in the garden saying ""Did you come with swords to capture me, as though I were a common thief?""

I found this story to be very inspiring. I hope it will be shown again on TV. It would be a good story for churches to show to their teenagers who strive to be like Jesus.",1168387200,8,1744,4.634304207119741

Thankfully, I didn't purchase the film. It was televised today, 3/30/2018, Good Friday.
Acting was horrible with a hint at homosexuality.
The character who played Jesus looked 16 years.

8027251,4,B0002ERWTG,"Jonathan Scarfe is poorly cast as Jesus. I watched this after his fabulous acting as a bad guy in ""Hell on Wheels."" He'd have made a better Judas. He is too sweet looking and acting to be the deeply serious Jesus facing  approaching torture. He's much better as a mad dog. Anyway, other than that, this is a good addition to my Jesus movie collection, especially about the conflicted Judas. By the way, the movie ""Barabbas"" with Billy Zane is another of those modern remakes that shows a more astute analysis  of the more subsidiary characters of the Jesus story.",1507852800,,563,4.62
8027252,5,B0002ERWTG,"While it always bothers me when a period movie has actors with mixed accents, I will say that after a while, I put that aside for Johnathon Schaech's wonderful performance as Judas (top of my list as Judas in Biblical movies, second being Gerard Butler as Judas/Dracula doomed to walk the earth for what he did).  Not one of us is in a position to state if Judas' actions were God-directed or not.  I am merely stating that  I liked the actor's performance as Judas, and with the focus on him, the character of Jesus was less stiff than in other movies.  (I think Jeremy Sisto did the best Jesus but I have to say Ted Neeley aced the destruction of the temple scene).  Someone mentioned a homosexual theme.  I find myself wanting to know if that writer is Christian (although none of my business).  I can see how someone could misinterpret Christ's gentle ways but it makes me sad that such a thought has to be brought into this movie, as well as thoughts of Illuminati.  If we look hard enough, we can find almost anything where it does not exist.  I think the ending was superb, from the magnificent Agnus Dei (I SO miss the Latin Mass and hymns), to the prayers over Judas.  The only other movie ending that affected me so was Johnny Depp's monologue at the end of The Libertine, voiced over the magnificent contralto voice of Ms. Summers.  I rated this movie on how it affected me, not on its production excellence.  Does it have flaws?  Absolutely.  However, I feel the performances of the two primary actors allowed them to be surpassed.",1492300800,,1543,4.503597122302159

8027256,1,B0002ERWTG,"This movie seems to be illuminati propoganda. The actor Jesus flashes the ok(666) symbol when he commanded the disciples to go and heal and the disciples acted as if they felt something strong as he was doing it. For a little background on the symbol, the illuminati either created or adopted it to flash allegiance to satan in a common and subtle way. The bible says the evil mark is 666. Well, 3 fingers make the 3 lines for sixes and the interlocked circle make the O in each six. The only question left to ask(since the ok symbol is so popular is) whether the actor Jesus or the people behind the scenes knew what they were doing? The disciples seemed to react to it as if they were receiving the Holy Ghost. So, chances are really great that somebody knew what it meant! If you haven't watched it, then look for it; they try to be almost subtle about it. Jesus was loving up until that point in the movie and Judah was rebellious. Honestly, I stopped watching almost at that point. The moment appeared blasphemous! The acting was great by Jesus and Judas and most everyone else. The other disciples were too lost; they didn't know to initially pray in the name of Jesus when he sent them out. Like they were baffled and unsure. Why not pray over the afflicted and then be unsure if that didn't work?
