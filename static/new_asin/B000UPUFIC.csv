8214371,2,B000UPUFIC,"I purchased this particular video because the titled and cover image suggests musical selections that celebrate Tin Tan's best character, the Pachuco or Zoot Suiter. It was so disappointing to find there were no songs form any of his films as a Pachuco character. In fact they are some of the least interesting musical numbers. You also have to skip through like a dozen commercial ads for cheap Mexican telenovelas and b-rated movies. There is no option to get to the main menu without doing this, so it it quite annoying. Then you do get 4 entire films, but again none of them feature the Pachuco character. I think the product is misleading.",1255651200,,644,4.707964601769912
8214372,3,B000UPUFIC,"The movies are great! but they are advertized as a 4 musical Pack, but in reality it has only three movies, this is the only negative thing I found out, other wise they are worth it.",1245369600,,182,4.083333333333333
8214373,4,B000UPUFIC,"For less than $20, you can get three solid, hilarious, side-splitting Tin Tan(German Valdez) comedies on one DVD: Simbad El Mareado, Vagabundo y Millonario, and El Nino Perdido! The DVD is also packed with musical clips from Tin Tan movies and a bunch of video spots for soap operas/telenovelas and Mexican movies. Unfortunately, the movies are shown in pan & scan with no subtitles.

To paraphrase Big Enos from Smokey and the Bandit, and I quote, ""Legends never die, they just lose some weight."" It would be a pity for an entertainer like Tin Tan to be forgotten. Enjoy!",1215388800,,572,4.777777777777778
