It was fascinating and I continued the research. It's been several (10+?) years now since I watched the video, but I remember it was around 2 hours long. The first hour was spent viewing pathogens (bacteria, etc.) under a microscope and watching what happened to them when the appropriate frequencies were applied. The 2nd hour was how to make a rife-type device yourself!  It is a terrific video to augment any Rife research study.",1302480000,2,585,4.82
8357854,3,1889071153,"Lets think critically. Royal Rife's disease theories are in the dustbin of history because they can't be independently verified, except by salesmen after your wallet. There are a zillion ways to kill pathogens while they are sitting on a microscope slide... but does this mean they all work in a living body? For example, Lysol kills the HIV virus. No one argues with that. But could a person drink it in sufficient quantity to cure AIDS? You'd be poisoned. No doubt Rife killed viruses in a laboratory environment. But extrapolating those results into the living body gets us back to the Lysol analogy - you'd fry yourself dead if you turned up the power high enough to ""zap"" parasites, buggies, etc. by any Hulda Clark or Royal Rife methodology. This is the fallacy of Radionics, a pseudoscience started in the early 20th century by Albert Abrams, who is currently burning in hell for fleecing thousands with bogus devices.

Sadly, there are still people picking up the song-flute and playing Abrams' tune all the way to the bank.  Hulda Clark is the premier example.",1243900800,4,1069,4.836065573770492
