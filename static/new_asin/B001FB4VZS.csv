3566723,5,B001FB4VZS,"i really think the future of all the superman trilogys has to be theroughly and carefully thought out from here. i believe tom welling should continue to carry out his superman title for atleast 2 generations due to how he started the only most detailed version of it...theres no gaps or loopholes with smallville and wouldnt be any if he continues the superman movies..think about it..for example..in superman returns, how did lex go to the fortress and talk to jorel and get all the secrets of the crystals when in smallville the minute any intruder walked in jorel either kicks them out or completely shuts down...??just food for thought..",1222128000,2,642,4.89908256880734
3566724,4,B001FB4VZS,"Well I like smallvilli and love supergirl I even love the that 70's movie about supergirl and I hate that supergirl is no longer on the show ( for now )  she got kidnapped and then after she came back she was just gone from the show and they never even talk about her and that sucks .
so that why it get 4 stars and not 5 .
I hope in this season he becomes superman and learn to flys",1221955200,,383,3.728395061728395

Make sure you catch up on seasons 6 and 7- then watch season 8 for a return to the fun, superman mythos based show that we have loved for so many years!
This season will be about Clark embracing his destiny and finally really becoming Superman- if not in costume then in spirit. THANKS SO MUCH for finally making Smallville available for downloading legally!",1221868800,,744,8.185185185185185

3566763,5,B001FB4VZS,"To all those who have problems with the  ""differences"" between the comics and the ""Smallville"" portrayal of the life and times of Clark Kent, slow down. This is NOT the first change to the Superman mythos. Smallville erased another character from the DC Universe: Superboy! In the original history of Kal-El he was know to the citizens of Smallville as Superboy and wore the cape, and the suit and still maintained his secret identity. So this isn't the first nor, it seems, the last change to the DC Universe. I know because I'm 63 and have been, and still am, both a DC as well as a Marvel comics fan!",1487030400,,603,4.4818181818181815

3566799,5,B001FB4VZS,"All I can say is wow!!.  This show is epic!!  No other Superman show or movie can compare to the greatness of Smallville.  Infact no other superhero show can compare either.  Tom Welling puts such feeling and emotion into Clark Kent, really bringing him to life.  Smallville has people from the other Superman movies starring in here or guests appearances in the show as well.  Of course DC comics was involved giving insight.  It's pretty epic and well thought out.  Of course there are very important episodes explaining his past and who he is, as well as Clark experiencing life and life choices in other episodes.  Alot of tie in's explaining how and why things came to be when he will one day be superman.  I started renting Smallville via Netflix DVD via the mail.  I was halfway through season 2.  It was just taking too long for the turnaround time from Netflix.  I couldn't wait any longer.  I went and bought all 10 seasons on Amazon HD video at $29.99 each.  I couldn't be any more happy.  Best money I ever spent.  I still continue to watch.  Thank you Tom Welling, cast, and crew for bringing us Smallville.  This show holds a special place in my heart.  Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed guaranteed.",1479945600,,1223,4.6

3566846,3,B001FB4VZS,"This season was hurt by the loss of Lex and Lionel, and Lana and Kara are mostly absent as well.  In their place, we get Tess Mercer (new CEO of LuthorCorp) and Davis Bloome, a paramedic with a difference.  Tess also takes over Lionel's bizarre ""I'm only trying to help you, Clark"" duties.  An episode with three members of the Legion of Super-Heroes is fun, yet breaks the flow of the overall story arc.  The Davis Bloome story-line just gets dragged out too long - but of course it has to last the entire season, doesn't it?

This was a great series for kids of all ages... but I would think ages 8 & older would enjoy it and not be too scared of the ""scary scenes"". Much friendlier then the ""Gotham"" storyline.

3567075,4,B001FB4VZS,"The season picks up several weeks after the season 7 finale.  Clark Kent (Tom Welling) is still missing after the Fortress of Solitude collapsed while he and Lex were fighting inside it.  Leading the search for the missing men, but with different teams and different agendas, are Oliver Queen (Justine Hartley) and Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman).  Oliver is hoping to find and rescue Clark while Tess is looking for her boss Lex.

When Clark is found and returns to Smallville, its to start his new life as a reporter at The Daily Planet working across the desk from Lois Lane (Erica Durance).  Meanwhile, Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) has a giant IQ and a fiance in the form of and Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore) and Chloe has also taken over the ISIS foundation.  Meanwhile Clark is caught on camera, sort of, and takes the next step in his evolution toward Superman as the mysterious Red Blue Blur.

But trouble is still brewing.  Not only are Tesss motives unclear, but she has moved in to the Luthor mansion and taken over all of Lexs roles, including editor of The Daily Planet.  Has she learned Clarks secret from the files Lex left behind?  Meanwhile, theres also paramedic Davis Bloome (Sam Witwer) who is very afraid he is harboring a deadly secret.  Is he correct?

There were lots of chances this season, both behind the camera with the creators and original show runners leaving, and in front of it with Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk not coming back to play Lex Luthor and Lana Lang.  Kristen did come back for a few episodes in the middle of the season to wrap up Lanas story, however.  That meant that it fell to the new characters to fill in the gaps.  Tess essentially plays a Lex clone in many ways story and mythology wise, and Davis makes an interesting character.  Sadly, I felt Oliver Queen was under used, but maybe thats just my interest in their take on the character as a fan of Arrow.

Despite the changes, the season started out great with many fun standalone episodes.  The increased flirting between Lois and Clark was lots of fun.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the main plot/villain of the season and what it did to Chloe and Jimmy and their relationship.  As that took over, I enjoyed the season less.  It was interesting, but not as fun as the beginning of the season.

The acting was great as always, and the special effects are still top notch.

The set includes 22 episodes in wide screen and full surround.  Extras include deleted scenes (but no gag reel), two audio commentaries, and two featurettes about Chloes directorial debut this season and the creation of the seasons big bad.

The early part of the season is fun and definitely worth watching.  I just didn't care for the choices they made late in the season.  Overall, this is still a good show.",1434585600,,2794,4.637474541751527

Out are Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk as Lex Luthor and Lana Luthor respectfully.

3567480,4,B001FB4VZS,"I watched Smallville religiously for the first two seasons, then I moved on, only to find my way back!

Through the years, I've popped in to watch an episode here and there, always happy to see the familiar faces of Clark, Lex, Lana, Chloe and the rest.

Have to admit though (don't judge), that it's SOLELY because of 'Being Human's' Sam Witwer that Smallville has once again hit my radar. I had forgotten (how?!) that he was Davis Bloom/Doomsday. It finally occurred to me that it was this season I had again wandered toward other shows.

So now my guilty pleasure is revisiting this show and enjoying the adventure all over again. (I also plan on going back to Battlestar Galactica, as he was on THAT show as well!)  :)

Smallville was a good story, with a great cast, and I'm happy I've found it again.",1400025600,,806,4.493150684931507

3567482,5,B001FB4VZS,"I love season 8 of Smallville. Part of the reason is the introduction of Davis Bloom/Doomsday played by Sam Witwer. This was the first show I'd ever seen him on. People know him now from Being Human. Which he is also really good on. It's one of the most exciting seasons because Clark struggles with putting Lex down for good, (he and Green Arrow/Oliver Queen butt heads about it) then he has to contend with Davis, who is also Doomsday sent (at the same time as Clark) to earth to destroy it. So Davis is the hunky possible love interest for Cloe (who is engaged and soon married to Jimmy). But he's also this terrifying monster that can't be killed. Cloe seems to be the only thing that can keep the monster at bay, but after a while that doesn't work. So, Clark struggles with the decision because Davis is also a human and he refuses to take a human life. Lana comes back and even though they have a brief and hot reunion, she soon has to leave Clark again for his own good. I mean, there is so much going on, I watched it liked I'd never seen it before. The whole season is fantastic.",1399420800,,1089,4.265700483091788

3567586,4,B001FB4VZS,"Season 7 seemed to be missing something, so this season was a nice change of pace. A few cast changes (no spoilers) shake things up a bit and take a little bit to get used to. The writers are able to get the new characters up and running fairly quickly, though you are unsure of their parts and what their characters will end up being at the beginning. It's becoming more about Lois and Clark, and less about love triangles and the high school type drama is all but eradicated. The show grew up with its audience and characters, which some shows have problems executing. Great stuff here!",1388275200,,588,4.453703703703703

Season eight retools the show to make it fresh again, however, the show doesn't feel the same anymore. Some of the rewriting of history later in the season gets annoying. One episode in particular, written by the show producers, had so many continuity flaws that it became discouraging to see the show keep going.",1386720000,,451,4.65

3567689,4,B001FB4VZS,"So there is a lot of cheesiness in this show but it is definitely worth watching. They incorporate a bunch of other DC characters in this show and is a great incarnation of Superman before he becomes Superman, but Clark will piss you off with his reluctant babyish personality especially in the early seasons. Also he's stupid and falls into everyone's trap, but that has always been Superman's true weakness, reluctance and the inability to think ""Hey, there might be kryptonite concealed in that led chamber."" Anyway, it's a good Superman show so watch it.",1376611200,,558,4.88421052631579

3567756,3,B001FB4VZS,"There were a few major changes in this season, and the Amazon editorial hits the nail on the head: as bad as this series was going (I trudged through seasons six and seven more because I'm obsessive enough to want to finish what I'd started, rather than because I enjoyed the show), season 8 breathes some life back into it. The snippets of the Superman superhero world begin coming alive a little bit, and the overall feel is that the series is finally heading somewhere -- albeit slower than desired. It seems there was a conscious effort to start addressing the DC universe, and at times this works out really well... but even a casual Superman fan like myself groaned at the way the last few episodes -- including the finale -- tried to incorporate more than it could handle. Absording the Doomsday character would've been great if they'd turned that last issue (er... episode!) into the knock-down drag-out fight such a character deserved. The main problem? Doomsday was a SUPERMAN'S villain in the book -- not the Smallville's incarnation of him. The lack of history and special effects limited the emotional impact the final episode SHOULD have had.",1373328000,,1156,4.814070351758794
3567757,5,B001FB4VZS,Lana is gone(almost). Lois and Clark are growing  closer. Doomsday is coming . But  alas no more Lex(miss Michael Rosenbaum. He was great. Best Lex Luthor ever). Just one great season.,1372982400,,184,4.903225806451613
3567758,4,B001FB4VZS,It was okay. I got excited about Doomsday when I started watching this season but it didn't meet my expectations.,1372636800,,113,4.7
3567759,5,B001FB4VZS,This season showed so much about Clark trying to gap peace and save Zod like his father asked. Really starting to become who he destined to be. SUPERMAN!,1370390400,,153,4.5
3567760,3,B001FB4VZS,"Smallville: The Eighth Season was daring because it introduced the super-villain, Doomsday. I wasn't expecting that at all, since in the comics (as any true Superman fan knows), Doomsday ""killed"" Superman towards the end of the Superman comic book series (but later we're told, in the comics, that Superman was in a ""coma"" and later awakens from the ""coma"", so he really wasn't killed). Also, in the comics, Doomsday was never completely human; he was an experiment created by a Kryptonian scientist to be the ultimate being/destroyer/survivor. It's understandable, to some degree, why the writers/producers introduced Doomsday in this season; I'm guessing it's because they decided to play and have fun with the idea of Doomsday (aka Davis Bloome) being human and an EMT/paramedic who helps people and is unknowingly infected with the bug/virus that transforms him into Doomsday, since they ran out of ideas on who should take Lex Luthor's place as the main villain in this season 8.
What was disappointing is that towards the end of this season (I believe the season finale), Doomsday/Davis Bloome is ""buried"" by Clark, but the questions remain at the surface: How did Clark ""bury"" Doomsday? Is Doomsday dead? Why hasn't Doomsday escaped/resurfaced and killed again? What is holding/preventing Doomsday from surfacing? The questions go on and on.

This season 8 deserves 3 stars because:
1. It was gutsy enough to introduce Doomsday so early on
2. Lois Lane reveals she's in love with Clark Kent
3. It shows Lex Luthor ""dead"" after being in a truck explosion (so it entices fans to guess what happened and is he really dead since, of course, Lex Luthor does not die in the animated series/movies/comics, etc.). This scene makes you wonder what really happened to Lex Luthor, when he's going to return to Smallville, and what he's going to do with Clark when he returns (maybe in seasons 9 and 10?).",1369612800,,1900,4.993690851735016
3567761,5,B001FB4VZS,"By the 10th and final season in the series you are either a fan or not, lol. Chances are you wouldn't be hunting for this season if you didn't like the show or want to see how it ends- It will not dissapoint. When I was laid up from my hysterectomy and couldn't get of the couch my husband and I ended up watching the entire series from start to finish and it was fun for us both (especially me since I never followed the series when it was on). Definitely recommend for all Smallville fans.",1369353600,,491,4.125

3567810,5,B001FB4VZS,The only part of this season I didn't like was the lana part I mean why do they have to make her into a super person like superman I swear lana is too weird man. Like the writers for this show just couldn't resist bringing lana back like the show was so much better with her gone. But other than that this season tells of clark finally coming to the daily planet saving people in metropolis,1367107200,3,390,4.144736842105263

the next thing i love about this episode is that lois finally finds out clark was the blur. which i've been waiting for a very long time for this to happen.

3568080,4,B001FB4VZS,"This was one of those dark, mysterious episodes which I tend to like. What I didn't like was Chloe's ability to trust strangers so quickly while discounting Clark's judgement.  After all the years of being together...she doesn't like Clark questioning things?  How many times did they break into offices in a questionable way just to ""get"" the story behind the mystery?  Many...so Clark following time honored tradition should have been supported by Chloe...even if it meant questioning meteor powered young people.  Yeah, I get she was trying to start a support group for these kids...but how many times did she say...meteor powered people always turned out bad.  And what irritated me most was her comment to Clark....""if you had the courage to step forward with your identity like these kids did""...(paraphrased)...etc.  I truly dislike it when people question Clark's courage because, in this world, he was raised to keep quiet about his secret.  This was ingrained in him...not only for his own safety, but as it turns out...for the safety of people close to him that could be kidnapped and used to control his powers.  Secrecy about his identity has to be a cornerstone of Clark Kent's life so to throw the courage line at him is unfair. So for me, the writer's direction for Chloe in this episode did not sit well with me cuz it seemed to contrast with her earlier behavior and POV from previous seasons. There wasn't consistency in her character here...and I just don't like her because of this.  This is the season where Chloe's ""magic"" starts to wear off on me.  I don't know what was behind Chloe not being in season 10 as a regular...but I can see that it was smart to move her away from Clark.",1304035200,,1706,4.752542372881356
3568081,1,B001FB4VZS,"Al Gough and Miles Millar's departure from the series was palpable in this season.  Their departure was so detremental that characters one had been following for the past 7 years up and turn a complete 180 from what you'd been seeing.  The writers clearly did not know what to do with the character of Chloe Sullivan, who has become a series fan favorite, and one sees her character that has long held a passion for reporting stumble through the series feigning a relationship with Jimmy Olsen and trying to figure out the arrival of Davis Bloome.  Also, the character of Lois Lane is contunually thrown in haphazardly into stories, with no clear arc other than the powers that be having to conform to comic book/movie history of having Lois & Clark pair up.  The strangest move yet was to have Clark Kent suddenly be thrown into the Daily Planet as a reporter when he had not even been working at the Planet, even part time.  It is a season that is filled with poor attempts to close storylines that had been carrying for the past 7 years while driving towards the train-wreck that was season 9.  Truly a sad turn of events for a program that started out with such an independent streak of revamping a character that's been around for decades and giving it new life by taking it back to the drawing board.",1302998400,6,1306,4.536170212765957
3568082,5,B001FB4VZS,I've always enjoyed the Smallville Series and this season is no exception. I'm just waiting to see if Clark/Superman learns to fly before the end of the Ninth Season.,1298592000,,166,4.758620689655173
3568123,4,B001FB4VZS,"If only SMALLVILLE were as good some seasons ago... I've got a Benjamin Button thing going on with this series. The Justice Society of America episode compelled me to watch the rest of Season 9, and I liked Season 9 enough that I took a chance with Season 8, which is also watchable enough that I'll now be checking out Season 7.

For all the myriad of sub-plots floating around in Season 8, really, there are two core story threads. One is Clark's assuming the role of Metropolis's mysterious guardian known insipidly as the ""Red-Blue Blur."" The other is the coming of Doomsday who, if you know your comic book history, once upon a time killed Superman.

The show's biggest knock, I think, will always be that it took its sweet time getting Clark in the iconic costume. Maybe Lightning Lad says it best: ""No glasses? No tights? No flights? So far, he's nothing like the Man of Steel."" And Tom Welling is, what, fifty-seven years old now? Still, SMALLVILLE's getting closer to seeing eye to eye with Superman's established continuity. Clark Kent has made it to the Daily Planet as its mild-mannered and newest copy boy, a position which finds him working even more closely with Lois Lane. Clark theorizes that working at the Planet would give him a heads-up on criminal activity in Metropolis, and he's not wrong. Seems our boy scout Kryptonian is finally ready to embrace his true calling.

This is also around the time that Clark begins to look at Lois in mushy fashion, and we also track Jimmy Olsen and Chloe's engagement and upcoming wedding. Cast regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk have amscrayed, although Kreuk returns for a few episodes. But new players step in. With Lex presumed dead, Tess Mercer becomes the new LuthorCorps CEO. The other new recurring character is Davis Bloome, a paramedic whose own arc ushers in Doomsday.

More characters from the DC Universe are featured. In ""Instinct,"" the beautiful alien queen Maxima comes to Earth looking for a perfect mate, but her kiss is lethal. ""Hex"" introduces the reverse spell-casting Zatanna in a nifty tale in which she grants Chloe's wish to have Lois's life. SMALLVILLE's version of the Justice League shows up in ""Odyssey"" and ""Doomsday,"" including Green Arrow who takes on a semi-recurring role. The Martian Manhunter appears several times. Kara Zor-El returns in ""Bloodline.""

But let's not kid ourselves. The jewel of this season is the terrific ""Legion"" episode which has the Legion of Super-Heroes time hopping from the 31st century to present-day Smallville to kill Brainiac. Comic book writer, the mighty Geoff Johns, pens the screenplay and manages to cling to the show's ""No tights"" policy, the Legionnaires stepping to Smallville sporting cool leather jackets that bear their individual, easily identifiable insignias. I love this episode. As they say, ""Long live the Legion.""

Other favorite episodes: ""Stilleto"" in which Lois assumes a superhero identity. ""Infamous"" is a time travel/alternate reality tale in which Clark is forced to reveal his identity to the world with horrifying repercussions. ""Hex"" is a hell of a lot of fun, with Serinda Swan muy sexy as Zatanna.

3.5 out of 5 stars for this season. Pretty good, but with flaws. Season 8 suffers from an inability to produce enough strong episodes and from Tom Welling's continued blandness (being so self-sacrificing is really annoying) and the unsatisfying season finale. Props, however, for the ever increasing influx of DC characters and for showcasing Brainiac in a bridal gown. With Rosenbaum gone, Allison Mack (""Chloe"") takes over as the cast's strongest actor, and I'm liking how Erica Durance is interpreting Lois Lane. Justin Hartley's take on the Green Arrow keeps on irking me.

SMALLVILLE - THE COMPLETE EIGHTH SEASON has the following special features: audio commentary on two episodes: ""Identity"" (with actress Cassidy Freeman, director Mairzee Almas, and executive producer Brian Peterson) and ""Legion"" (with writer Geoff Johns and producers Darren Swimmer & Tim Scanlan); Deleted/Unaired Scenes from 10 episodes: ""Plastique,"" ""Instinct,"" ""Legion,"" ""Power,"" ""Requiem,"" ""Turbulence,"" ""Hex,"" ""Eternal,"" ""Beast,"" and ""Injustice""; ""In the Director's Chair: Behind the Lens and Calling the Shots with Allison Mack"" - a peek at the actress directing the episode ""Power"" (00:19:13 minutes long); ""SMALLVILLE's Doomsday: The Making of a Monster"" delves into the creative process which brought this incarnation of Doomsday to life (00:15:23 minutes).",1297555200,,4506,5.179945054945055
3568124,5,B001FB4VZS,"It had been hinted at, or at least a little more than just hinted, that Lana would take her departure while Lois would enter. As Clark becomes more the Man of Steel that we love as the legend, we've taken some pretty depressing hits with Lana and Lex in the series. But finally comes: Season 8.

Its a little bit of a relief.

The new villians, Tess Mercer and Davis Bloome kind of seem a little cheap compared to the Legend of Lex Luthor, but there are enough hints to let us know that he'll be making a comeback when Smallville becomes Superman. They aren't ruining the legend, just enhancing it.

It must be the magic between the 2 characters and the 2 actors that leads me to say...Lois rocks. I just wish they had shown more episodes of these 2 as a couple. I am a bit sad that we won't get more of episodes like Infamous anymore now that the series is ending. I love the strength of Lois and the vulnerability as well.

I think this is also first time Lois calls Clark on the phone for help...which is good indicator that she already sees him in a different way. He's been her protector for longer than we give him credit. He's been doing it since the day they met but we don't think about him in that way because Lana was always in the picture.  In reality, he's been protecting Lois since day 1 and she is finally accepting that.  Finally, how creepy is Chloe at the end?",1295222400,,662,4.15625

i'm 80% through this season now, and it's surprisingly good. in fact, lex is all over this season, and the various ways they make his presence felt without using the original actor are pretty clever. there were a few things i thought were handled poorly, which i won't discuss so as not to spoil anything. still, all in all, this is highly entertaining stuff. better than season one, which in my opinion was the choppiest of seasons. if you like what's come before, don't be afraid to give this a shot.

Someone said he's too serious, but the portrayal is that of someone trying to come to grips with saving people's lives...and he takes this very seriously.  Perhaps it's not in keeping with the Superman comic in that it isn't light-hearted all the time...but this series has so much drama...how can you not love it.  It allows us to feel every kind of emotion possible...and all of this in a single episode.  It's genius how they are able to deal with so many characters and tie them all together in a coherent way.  Thanks for another great episode.
edited 9 Feb 2011:  Just saw this again and that final scene is one of my favorites of the series.

My only wish is that they'd continue beyond the 10th year and actually have a series where Clark Kent has fully embraced his role as Superman and we see more development of his relationship with Lois Lane.
edited 16 Jan 2011: I didn't like Lois in this portrayal.  I thought it started off well with them being thrown into the Phantom Zone but I really wanted her to question Clark more about what was going on.  I wanted her to ask the tough questions and I really wanted to see him being more protective of her.  I didn't feel it in this episode.  Nonetheless, he is the one that takes actions to save her.  But, I didn't like that Lois was taken over by one of the phantoms.  It was just awkward. Her portrayal...the way she looked was just awkward.

It is actually in this episode that you find out for sure what Lois feels for Clark...so...how can this be, in any way, a disappointment.  And it was done in such a way that the revelation was a real struggle to let out.  The frst time you see this epi the revelation is a complete surprise...a surprise in that they revealed her feelings at this point in the series.

3568196,4,B001FB4VZS,"I started watching SMALLVILLE (which premiered in 2001) on a first run basis with this SEASON 8 (that I'm reviewing). I'd heard about the show back during it's pre-series premiere period and had obviously seen Tom Welling and immediately saw why (from a physical standpoint) was a good choice for the role. But, as the old saying goes, ""The proof is in the pudding"", so I had to actually see for myself. I knew that the show really was supposed to be about Clark Kent before he became Superman, but obviously since the show kept going for so long, they couldn't avoid him growing up and having to start working at the Daily Planet in Metropolis. Having bought the dvds of all previous seasons (1 to 7), the show presents it's own unique twist on the Superman legend. So for those 7 seasons, the show was pretty much set strictly in Smallville, Kansas with a ""teen-aged"" Clark Kent, starting out as a kind of teen detective investigating mysterious goings-on in Smallville (Seasons 1-3), then shifting more towards learning about his true identity and destiny (Seasons 4-7). Then in comes SEASON 8 and now he's FINALLY working at the DP in Metropolis (which happens to be nearby his hometown!) and morphing into a real superhero!

Before I get into the meat of my review, I've got to say that I think Tom Welling was a great choice for the role. He perfectly plays Clark as a sweet, slightly awkward and guarded innocent youth, not the faux geeky, clumsy Clark putting on a ruse for the rest of the world. That is, he is just being himself! It's kind of like watching Superman if he were walking around as he is one of us...which he actually is on this show! And Welling is still convincing looking like a hero-in-the-making and pulling off saves from week-toweek. He's done a very commendable job of carrying the series for it's run. SEASON 8 is the start of Welling being allowed to give Clark more depth, complexity, and maturity, but still embodying the boyish charm that he had in previous seasons, with still lingering desires and ties to his former small town life.

SEASON 8 is interesting b/c I didn't realize how long the character Lois Lane (played wonderfully by Erica Durance) had been on the show. I think I saw a glimpse of an episode from an earlier season by accident (when I was channel-flipping!) with her in it and at the time thought, ""Oh, so they decided to bring Lois Lane into Smallville!"". I actually remember it was a scene with Clark where they didn't seem to get along at all! Lois was actually introduced in the Season 4 premiere episode CRUSADE as the cousin of Chloe Sullivan (played by the refreshing Allison Mack, who's been part of the main cast since the show's inception in 2001). I needed to see the earlier episodes to gain some perspective on the current ones and see that Clark and Lois have always had this witty, snappy banter from their first meeting (there were actually times when you could have confused them for feuding siblings!). A kind of pre-cursor to their future, iconic sympatico once the Superman story kicks off. The weird thing is that bringing Lois onto the show would seem like a bad idea, but it is the total opposite! Lois and her interactions with Clark made Season 4 for me, and is really a large part of the progression and maturity of Clark Kent, whereas other characters in one way or another seemed to keep him tied down.

Early SEASON 8 was kind of a transition period trying to make Metropolis the main backdrop of storylines and the start was a tad shaky, as the show was undergoing a major overhaul with half of the cast being newcomers, so the viewer had to all of a sudden get used to fresh new faces. The season premiere Episode 1-ODYSSEY was a mixed big, starting with great action sequence in the Arctic at the remains of the Fortress of Solitude (destroyed by Lex Luthor at the end of Season 7, with he and Clark being caught in the explosion), then dual rescue attempts of Clark (in Russia) and Chloe (in a Luthorcorp Nevada facility) by Oliver Queen aka The Green Arrow (new series regular Justin Hartley, who was only a recurring character in Season 6 and appeared in only one episode in Season 7) and Lois, respectively, then some ethereal nonsense with the Martian Manhunter character aka John Jones, culminating in Clark and Lois becoming partner reporters at the DP; also a new character Tess Mercer (played with delicious complexity by fiery redhead Cassidy Freeman) is introduced as Lex Luthor's top assistant that he put in charge of his corporation Luthorcorp in case he became incapacitated (as he did in Season 7 finale ARCTIC). Standout eps of early SEASON 8 include Ep 5-COMMITTED (an iconic Lois and Clark episode!) and Ep 6-PREY (the beginnings of the Doomsday storyline, with new regular Sam Witwer playing paramedic Davis Bloome, who alter ego is Doomsday). Also, the impending marriage of Chloe and Jimmy Olsen (played hilariously by regular Aaron Ashmore since Season 6) plays a big part in early SEASON 8. Generally, early SEASON 8 has an iconic Superman feel, but Clark hasn't fully assumed that identity yet and instead saves people under the moniker ""The Red-Blue Blur"", or RBB for short. Another big part of early SEASON 8 is Lois surprisingly having strong feelings towards Clark that she didn't expect to have, but Clark being totally oblivious to them! An ironic twist of the legend where usually Clark falls for Lois first, but this is a neat aspect of this show that I like, the way the sometimes tweak the mythos, in this case with positive results. For me, it is a more realistic interpretation of the mythos, giving Lois real vulnerability and humanity.

Upon careful re-watch of early SEASON 8, it's obvious that the show hadn't completely cut the ties to earlier seasons. Clark still wasn't over his first love Lana Lang (more on her later!). Early SEASON 8 eps slyly foretold (knowing Lana was to return for a brief mid-season stint that would end her storyline) that Clark needed a major life change to help push him to becoming what he was really meant to be. Also, early on, it was hard for Clark to let go of Chloe knowing that marrying Jimmy would change things between them forever. The Clark-Chloe and Clark-Lana subplots still have a lingering effect in early SEASON 8 eps (with only references to Lana since she still hadn't shown back up yet), and even weaker ones like 2-PLASTIQUE and 4-INSTINCT show Clark as being very guarded and emotionally distant and unsure of he is on the right path. Welling really gives a nuanced performance that illustrates that his version of Clark Kent is perhaps the most ""human"" of all incarnations. Yet throughout all of the early season, Clark was repeatedly given hints that he did have feelings for Lois, in some cases by people close to him (Chloe in TOXIC, his cousin Kara in BLOODLINE) and even outside forces sensed their deep connection that neither Clark nor Lois seemed to want to admit. Clark was still so emotionally fragile and grounded and Lois so stubborn and resolved, that they kept their feelings hidden.

Moving toward the mid-part of SEASON 8, there is a 5-episode story arc (Eps 10-BRIDE, 11-LEGION, 12-BULLETPROOF, 13-POWER, 14-REQUIEM) that re-introduces the character of Lana Lang (admirably reprised by Season 1 to 7 regular Kristin Kreuk).  Kreuk had to honor her contract b/c she left 5 episodes early at the end of Season 7 to do a film. The first couple of episodes (BRIDE and LEGION) were smashingly good! Ep 10-BRIDE, the ep of Chloe and Jimmy's wedding, was a season standout with emotions running high between Lois and Clark and they are about to kiss at the wedding reception when Lana returns; then Lana and Clark had a great discussion scene about their tortuous relationship that is one of the most mature ones I've ever seen them have on the show; this scene illustrates how guilty and responsible Clark always felt about Lana and also that Lana didn't necessarily need Clark in her life to survive; then there was a truly horrifying Cloverfield-type scene with an attack by Doomsday on the wedding party, with Doomsday (under the influence of Brainiac) kidnapping Chloe; other results include Jimmy being seriously wounded and Lois deciding to accompany him to Star City for his recovery; so Lois leaving left the door open for Lana to insinuate herself back into Clark's life. Lana just kind of occupied space in 11-LEGION, the most purely entertaining episode of the season, with a trio of Legionnaires who returned from the future to help Clark find Chloe, who has been infected by Brainiac to take over the world. The plot of 12-BULLETPROOF (about bad cops) was weak, but the parts including or dealing with Lana were good, especially a key conversation between Chloe and Clark about Lana's return, Clark's inability to let go of her, and his unexpected feelings for Lois. It looked like Clana was going to end the right way! But 13-POWER (directed by co-star Allison Mack) was the most obvious worst episode of Season 8. It is a weird episode with poorly handled flashback scenes, terrible lighting, horrendous dialogue, and bad acting; it ""explains"" why Lana really left late in Season 7 and is really a poorly done retcon. Then there is 14-REQUIEM, a good episode with the return of an incapaciated Lex Luthor (a double for Michael Rosenbaum with tubes covering his face to mask him) pulling the strings as a Kryptonite bomb is about to destroy Metropolis. Lana had actually started to confront her inner demons in late Season 7 and Lana's departure in Season 7 made total sense based on the way that Season 7 shaped up, then the show's producers made the ridiculous decision to retcon it with the storyline of POWER, which to an extent betrayed and undermined both the character progressions of Lana (late Season 7) and Clark (early Season 8); the end scene of POWER shows Clark's growing doubt and confusion and Lana's misguided good intentions, but once again Lana intoxicates Clark and leads him astray; then REQUIEM pulls the doomed lovers apart forever. I feel the Lana arc SEASON 8 should have either (A) been done at the end of Season 7 (which unforunately was not possible), (B) been handled differently, or (C) not done at all. But at the end of the day, given that SMALLVILLE initially revolved around Clark, Lana, and Lex, I view this arc as the end of the old days of SMALLVILLE. For me, this arc just re-inforces the fact that Clark-Lana as a couple were for the most part a doomed relatonship, and when they were together, they were never really happy with each other and ultimately, just plain incompatibile. Their relationship started out sweet in early seasons, but degenerated into something very non-descript in later seasons; I think the final decision to end them the way they did was more a way to satisfy ""Smallville"" fans, since the show started with them, than to satisfy ""Superman"" fans, although there are a LOT of Smallville fans that actually don't like it, including myself!

Understand that Lana Lang was Clark's FIRST love, but not his TRUE love (big difference!). At this point, although being very protective of and somewhat attracted to Lois, Clark didn't see the possibilities with her. Lois is a very gorgeous woman, but make no mistake, there is MUCH more to her than meets the eye! She is amazingly tough, resilient, ambitious, and forthright, but she is surprisingly vulnerable and sensitive at times also. What I like about the Clark-Lois dynamic on SMALLVILLE is that they literally complement each other to the point that neither of them knows it! Clark is able to penetrate Lois' tough exterior and see where she's really coming from and Lois activates Clark's protective instincts, but in a very positive way that makes him act more like a man. There were many times in prior seasons where Clark's overprotectiveness of Lana bordered on obsession and was almost one-sided where she would either accuse him of hiding secrets from her and wouldn't accept that he was just doing it out of love (the fact is, several times she was right!); this lingering mistrust spelled doom for their relationship! But with Lois, she accepts Clark for his humanity and just sees him as a truly nice guy with the best intentions. It's an amazingly refreshing twist on the mythology where Lois Lane is usually all starry-eyed for Superman and treats Clark Kent like utter crap! I much prefer SMALLVILLE's interpretation of Lois and Clark!

Prior to SEASON 8, Clark-Lois were really frenemies who had unknown deep-seated feelings for each other that EVERYONE else could see, but neither of them could! Lois had been on the show for 4 full seasons by SEASON 8 and she and Clark had established as much of an important relationship (I'd say more important) than either of his relationships with Lana or Chloe (who Clark had also had a brief relationship with in Seasons 1 and 2), but Clark couldn't really see the big picture with Lois, only seeing her as a close friend and partner; and Lois kept her strong feelings for Clark deeply hidden and would always change the conversation between them when things got deep or intense; Lana always had his heart, but Clark could never really talk or be honest with her, while Chloe could totally relate to and converse with Clark, but Clark never had strong enough feelings for her other than friendship; the show did a brilliant job of showing the incompatibility of Clark and Chloe as a couple and that they were much better off as best friends; and Clark and Chloe never got involved deep enough for their friendship to ever seem awkward; the Clark-Chloe friendship is a major reason why SEASON 8 is so good, with Tom Welling and Allison Mack having to carry the show appearing in every episode, with the rest of the cast revolving around them and only appearing in limited fashion. But given her limited appearances, Erica Durance made the most of her portrayal of Lois Lane, proving that she could play the iconic character in her own special way and also why she is the perfect counterpart to Clark. Clark and Lois maintained their ""frenemy"" relationship in SEASON 8, but also injected it with a lot of sexual innuendo that indicated there were signs of real sparks and attraction. Welling and Durance just plain have that IT factor that is too strong to ignore!

After Lana left, the show swiftly made up for the Lana arc with an immensely strong episode entitled 15-INFAMOUS, one of my faves of the season, revealing why LOIS is truly THE ONE for Clark! In this ep, Clark, compelled by evil down-and-out meteor freak reporter Linda Lake (guest star Tori Spelling in a fun, hammy, yet juicy performance, reprising her role from the Season 6 ep HYDRO) to admit to the world that he's the RBB, reveals his secret to Lois, but everything goes awry and Clark must use the time-travelling Legion ring (given to him in LEGION) to go back long enough to thwart Lake, but not before Lois bares her soul to Clark; it is Lois' big revelation where Clark Kent realized that SHE is his true soulmate, so the rest of the season has Clark beginning his quest to become the man and superhero worthy of a woman like Lois; his first priority is to protect Lois from knowing his secret at all costs to keep her safe, but also he doesn't want things with her to end the way they did with Lana; he decides to express his feelings for Lois as the RBB, so the show takes on more of the ""Superman"" vibe with Lois beginning to fall for the RBB and Clark having to bide his time to express his feelings for her, starting in Ep 19-STILETTO. Ep 17-HEX (where Chloe gets a wish to be Lois for a day) is a great one, with Erica Durance winningly mimicking Allison Mack as ""Chlois"" and Tom Welling matching her beat for beat playing the ""iconic"" version of Clark Kent. Later SEASON 8 also shifted more focus more on the Doomsday storyline with the powerful, tragic Ep 18-ETERNAL, a retcon ep explaining how Davis-Doomsday came to earth as a boy; we learn that Davis knew Lex Luthor as a child and there is a debate as to which one is truly Clark's worst enemy; as Chloe finds herself falling for Davis, but torn between her feelings for him and protecting Clark; thinking she has killed Davis with massive amounts of Kryptonite, turns out it only made Doomsday stronger and so Chloe opts to help Davis (to keep him from becoming the beast again) and they runaway together. Late SEASON 8 has Clark and the Justice League searching for Chloe and Davis and trying to defeat Doomsday. The season finale Ep 22-DOOMSDAY was sadly a disappointment overall, though, with a decision that actually managed to top the ones in POWER and REQUIEM in utter absurdity (although there is one VERY iconic scene involving Clark and Jimmy that is just plain AWESOME). Still, with the stories shifted to Metropolis over Smallville, SEASON 8 definitely has a more Superman appeal to it than prior ones.

In this eighth season of ""Smallville,"" the series reinvents itself in a drastic manner in a way it really has not done since its third season.  Changes are both major and subtle, adding up to a welcome different tone for the show.

For starters, Tom Welling's Clark Kent is finally not shying away from his superhuman side, though arguably his most famous power is still missing in action.  However, the eighth season premiere ""Odyssey"" finds him completely powerless in a harsh work camp.  In a maneuver that is at once head-scratching and smooth, the globetrotting Oliver Queen rescues him from the harsh overseer of the camp.  Oliver is again played very well by Justin Hartley, joining the main cast opening credits in this season.  Overall, the season premiere does a very nice job of pressing a reset button on the whole series and introducing a unique season.

Three series stalwarts ended their time on the show as regulars in the seventh season:  Michael Rosenbaum, John Glover, and Kristin Kreuk.  Though Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor and John Glover's Lionel Luthor do not appear in the eighth season, Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang does.  Though most of the episodes she appears in as part of a mini-arc are very good(with two glaring exceptions called ""Power"" and ""Requiem""), the character was very tired and needed to simply fade away.

To compensate for the losses of Rosenbaum and Glover, the show introduces two more antagonists in the form of Tess Mercer and Davis Bloome, played respectively by Cassidy Freeman and Sam Witwer.  The new CEO of LuthorCorp, Tess is given a meaty story that Cassidy Freeman acts very solidly.  Davis Bloome is a slightly less believable character because though Sam Witwer is unexpectedly brilliant, he gives away his hand much too early by the mood of his portrayal.

Also featuring a controversial and frankly subpar season finale called ""Doomsday,"" and a world of relationship growth between Clark and Lois, the eighth season of ""Smallville"" is a nearly perfect rejuvenation of the series.",1272067200,,2054,5.017699115044247

The series as a whole has had it's ups and downs, but I have never felt like it was not worth my time to watch. This season finally got back to the roots of the superman/Clark Kent persona. It got rid of previous characters with worn out episode ideas while getting back to what made Smallville great. The development of the many characters and the chemistry of the actors is really what makes this show worth watching. In my opinion, the greatest thing about this season is that it got rid of the character of Lana Lang and went back to developing the relationship between Clark and Lois. The episodes have also started to get much more interesting as well. With apperances from different Justice League characters and intriguing plot twists, the writers really had me waiting for each new episode to air.

As Amazon and other reviewers have stated, Tess is the perfect replacement for Lex Luthor. Is she friend or foe, you be the judge. For those traditional Superman fans, finally the relationship of Lois and Clark gets the spotlight. Also, one of Superman's most powerful enemies, Doomsday appears this season. And although Michael Rosenbaum doesn't appear on screen, Lex Luthor's presence this season is just as big and important as it ever was while he lurks behind the scenes.

I love the new darker turn of this season; thank heavens for finally getting rid of Lana (of whom I was previously a fan until her character played itself out and yet the writers kept her in, no matter the ridiculousness of the plot - seriously, marrying Lex? superpowers?). I am missing Lex Luthor (and the fantastic Michael Rosenbaum) however, as we didn't really get to see the final turn in the Superman/Lex story. I only hope that the writers plan to bring Lex back down the road once Clark completes his turn into the superhero. Of course, this wish is pinned on my desperate hopes that they bring Smallville back for a 10th season now that it has finally become less teen-soap-like. I really like the replacement character of Tess though since she can't really be pinned down. I love the relationship between Clark and Lois, especially since we all know how inevitable it is. It felt a little patchy, however, when Clark was supposedly so in love with the returned super-powered Lana, who leaves Clark devastated and in the next episode he is completely over her and back on track with his infatuation with Lois. This can most likely be attributed to the writers realizing that Clark had really long since fallen out of love with Lana and her farewell episode was idiotic and there was no need to dwell on the writers mistake. Love Oliver's character (played by the great Justin Hartley) and the always reliably wonderful Allison Mack as Chloe.

3568400,2,B001FB4VZS,"I've been watching Smallville for a long time know and I have to say this was probably my least favorite Season.  The slow decline after Season 4 continues.  Though Season 7 was mildly disappointing, there were standout episodes and story arcs that really kept fans, like me, coming back for more.  The Veritas story arc and the handful of Lex episodes saved that season.  Season 8 on the other hand is just super disappointing all around.

In some ways this Season was supposed to be a payoff season.  You finally see Lana and Clark together.  But Lana is no longer who she once was, so the whole Clark and Lana relationship just doesn't carry the same emotional gravity it did years ago.  Sort of a sad way to see Kristen Kreuks leave the show.  Along with this, I had some high hopes for the Doomsday/Bloom story line. What you get are seriously unbelievable sequences of decisions made by Chloe.  Her motivations and actions just don't add up to any logical conclusion.  Just when you thought they could redeem things with a great season finale, everything just felt so rushed.  It was like someone pushed fast forward on the Blu-Ray without letting anyone know what was happening.  Unlike previous season finales where I was super excited to know what was going to happen next season, I felt horribly confused about what the heck happened in the last 10 minutes.

It takes a few episodes to gain its footing before delivering some really good, entertaining episodes, but unfortunately it falls on its face a lot too. I'm not sure what the writers were thinking when they reintroduce old characters that should stay gone, but they like to beat a dead horse with the whole Romeo/Juliet love story. Smallville, unfortunately falls under the failure spell of almost all TV dramas, meaning that it refuses to let characters be happy and therefore has a tendency to let viewers down.

Look forward to seeing more DC characters share the screen and watching another villain storyline develop.

3568769,5,B001FB4VZS,"With the departure of Michael Rosenbaum, Kristin Kreuk, AL Gough, and Miles Millar, Smallville was facing some of its greatest challenges yet. Despite the departures, Season 8 delivers big time. Growing up, I was always a huge fan of Smallville, but the show was not as respected by outside circles who criticized it for formulaic writing and acting. Season 8 in my mind made Smallville a more respected show in all circles. Previous seasons had some inconsistent filler episodes in between some fabulous premieres and finales, but this season had its most consistent episodes yet. What makes this season a step up from the previous seasons is the light and playful romance between lois and clark, which stood in stark contrast to the childish drama of clark and lana of previous seasons. Clark has FINALLY stepped up his game and has begun his duties as a hero by becoming the Blur. (lame name right?)
Seeing CLark acting in a mature and heroic fashion was very rewarding. All the characters this season are given more depth as well, especially Lois. When Lois was introduced into the show in season 4 it seemed more of a publicity stunt to get more ratings instead of a good plot device. Lois has finally stepped up this season. While maintaining her sassy, bossy herself, Lois displays a more vulnerable side which has given her character more depth. We learn why Lois becomes attached to her career and why she develops a strong infatuation with the Blur. The unraveling of CHloe and Jimmy's relationship was a great plot arc as well as it showed the dark side of Chloe coming to the surface. In the middle of the season, Lana returns and closure is finally brought between Clark and Lana in a heartbreaking manner due to a teaming of an excellently portrayed Toyman and a vengeful Lex Luthor from the shadows.
Another challenge, the writers had was introducing the comic book character DOomsday with a limited budget. By following the formula of ""showing less is more"" the Doomsday monster becomes a frightenting and intimidating threat. THe writers also developed Doomsdays human side in a efficient manner and in typical SMallville fashion, they show the character's downfall to circumstances.
Although, the season is one of the best, it still has it flaws. The budget was limited this season and it is apparent in the sets which feel kinda cheap. Also, the final clash between Doomsday and Clark was underwhelming in comparison to its comic book and cartoon counterparts due to the limited budget. Also, a major character was written off in a cheap manner that screamed of bad contract negotiations that resulted in great backlash from the fans. Despite a faulty finale it set itself up for a great season 9.",1262995200,,2716,4.855603448275862
3568770,4,B001FB4VZS,"This time Clark Kent is closer to Lois Lane than expected, being the Diary Planet the scenery, at most, to these 'close encounters'. Not to surprisingly Lex Luthor desappears from the scene, but another villain (?)enters, could I say, brighter than Lex Luthor but with much more insinuating and subtle methods: Tess Mercer. The star lacking in the rate belongs to the presence of Doomsday being in the comics to much for an enemy and supossedly the ultimate doom for a flying and full-developed Clark Kent, here mere shows of little strenght, and for the last battle to few for a super foe, if possible, more powerfull than the same Superman.
The envelope came right at time as usual. Pretty much better in plastic than the last season (7). Thanks producers.

Season Seven went downhill with mostly filler episodes, though Supergirl was a welcome addition.  However, Season Eight falls flat on its face.  No Lex+No Lionel+Pretty Much No Supergirl+a trashy Doomsday= the worst season of Smallville ever.  This season, for the most part, moves at such a snail like pace that Days of Our Lives probably moves fast by comparison.

From what I understand, Season Nine so far REALLY goes back to Season Six like quality. Perhaps the quality went up because of the writer's strike- the writers could sit at home and think of some good Smallville for a change.  Regardless, you would do yourself a lot of justice to just skip over Season Eight and move directly to Season Nine.",1262390400,,815,4.827338129496403

For those who loved the comics, there's enough of the original story to give a sense of familiarity; for those who want something totally new, there are elements that make you sit up and take notice.

Season Review-

Even after seven years, Smallville was surprisingly going strong into its eighth season. After probably the worst season of the series (Season 7), not to mention the exit of show creators Al Gough and Miles Millar as well as long time cast members Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk, everyone pretty much agreed that Smallville's eighth season would be a sad and pathetic end for the series. But Season 8 proved to be one of the best seasons of Smallville in some time, probably the most consistent season in terms of story-telling and character development of the series since Season 3 even. Finally, Clark Kent wasn't just the farm boy from Smallville still unsure about his destiny and what he truly wanted in his life but a Clark Kent closer to his comic book counterpart. Clark gets some of the best story progression and character development in years as Clark is given two impressive storylines: 1)Clark joins Lois down in the basement as the Daily Planet's newest reporter. It's great seeing Clark investigating along side Lois Lane like the comics, especially the irresistible chemistry between the iconic duo. Tom Welling and Erica Durance breath new life into their performances this season with the hilarious banter and witty dialogue between Clark and Lois. 2) Clark decides to become Metropolis' newest hero, quickly getting the attention of the city and being known as ""the Red Blue Blur."" Both storylines are straight out of the comics and the most Superman inspired storylines the series has ever down.

Other great storylines come with the arrival of two new characters: Cassidy Freedman as Tess Mercer, Lex's unofficial replacement/new CEO of Luthorcorp and Sam Witwer as Davis Bloome, a paramedic in Metropolis with a dark secret that not only threatens Clark but the world. Tess Mercer is a mysterious character, who spends most of her time looking for Lex but soon comes into her own as Tess' suspicions of Clark grow stronger, leading her to the truth. But while Tess' storyline is intriguing, it's Davis Bloome aka Doomsday that steals the show. When news broke out that the writers were going to introduce Doomsday to Smallville, many fans and critics thought it couldn't be done, even cringing at the thought. But for the most part, the storyline is probably one of the darkest and most entertaining storylines of the series. Sam Witwer is one of the best actors to grace the series, giving such incredible depth to the man behind the monster that will eventually kill Superman. The new show runners do a fine job of letting the storyline play out naturally, with each episode having a purpose, adding to the overall arc of the season. There are tons of great episodes to be found in this season like the suspense comedy ""Committed"", the dark and thrilling ""Prey"", the Supergirl send-off ""Bloodline"", Doomsday's epic debut in the wedding blockbuster ""Bride"", DC comic legend Geoff John's ""Legion"", Tori Spelling's return as Linda Lake in the ""what if"" episode ""Infamous"", the Zattana comedy ""Hex"", the twisted origins of Doomsday in ""Eternal"" and Lois' hilarious turn as a superhero in ""Stiletto"". Also, this is the most DC comics influenced season yet with dozens of comic characters introduced. Not only did we have the Justice League, Doomsday and Brainiac but also Maxima, Plastique, the Legion of Superheroes, the Persuader, Shadow Theif, Toyman, Dan Turpin, Parasite, Livewire, Bruno Mannheim, the Injustice League and more. We also got to see the other characters evolve and go through some of the darkest storylines they've ever been through. Like Allison Mack's Chloe Sullivan who is given the best story arc she's ever gotten as Chloe discovers she has a new power and one she thinks she can use to help Clark even more when it comes to saving the day. But the power is consuming her more and more by the day as she discovers it's really Brainiac gaining control of her body; planning to unleash his deadliest plan yet. This exciting story concludes in a fantastic three episode mini-arc (""Abyss"", ""Bride"" and ""Legion"") that sees terrifying flashes of Chloe's memories being ripped from her mind, Clark battling Doomsday for the first time and the Legion of Superheroes as well as The Persuader arriving from the future in an action-packed adventure. The only downside is that this is possibly the last decent storyline Chloe will ever get as during the second half of Season 8 (and especially during the current 9th season) the writers seem to not know what else to do with the character and her actions toward other characters have become harsh, even cruel. Justin Hartley's Oliver Queen/Green Arrow goes through a bit of a dark struggle during the beginning of the year but slowly becomes the hero we all love again. Aaron Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen is given a lot more depth this season than the past two as Jimmy is the one who discovers the mysterious saves of the Red Blue Blur and is an integral part of making his presence known to Metropolis. It makes it even sadder to see how ultimately Jimmy's story arc ends, but the beginning of it is some of the best material the character has ever been given. Last but not least, Erica Durance's Lois Lane is more front and center this season than the last few as she and Clark are working side by side as reporters and the character discovers that her feelings for Clark are more serious than she ever imagined. Her finest moments are without a doubt in ""Stiletto"", especially when Lois shares a very iconic scene with the future Superman that involves a telephone booth.

But while Season 8 gave us some of Smallville's highest highs, it also gave us some of the series' lowest lows. First, the season starts off with impressive momentum, only for all of it to be abruptly stopped for the return of Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang in the embarrassing Super Lana arc. What makes this arc so lousy and unbearable is that instead of using Lana's final episodes to give the character a proper farwell, especially her romance with Clark that took up the last 7 years of the series. The writers decided to showcase Lana Lang as a superhero by giving her a super suit and becoming Clark's equal in almost every way. Excuse me...what!? The beyond abysmal ""Power"" and ludicrous Lana Lang send-off ""Requiem"" are two of the worst episodes the writers have ever written, feeling completely out of place in a season that was damn near superb at that point. Second, the Doomsday arc was such a deep and sometimes powerful storyline that many fans anticipated the final showdown between Clark and Doomsday in the season finale. In the now infamous ""Doomsday"", the fight between Clark and Doomsday was lacking in every sense of the word, not to mention, the unforgivable retcon they did to Jimmy Oslen undermined what the character had done since his debut in Season 6. It was hard to believe such a strong season could end on such a weak note. But this time luckily, the good outweighed the bad. All and All, Smallville's eighth season was an excellent return to form for this series for the most part. It's probably the most Superman-eqse season thus far giving us some truly iconic moments we'd never thought we'd see until Clark put on the tights.

Season Rating: 8.5/10

Video and Audio-

All 22 Season 8 episodes look as clear and as sharp as ever in widescreen HD! The sound ain't half bad either.

Video and Audio Rating: 8/10

Extras-

The box set only contains 2 commentaries (""Identity"" and ""Legion"") like the previous set which sucks because there are other episodes fans would love to see commentaries for like ""Abyss"" and ""Bride"". I know I would have loved a commentary for ""Prey"" (my personal favorite) Geoff Johns does provide some nice facts for the ""Legion"" commentary but it would be nice to hear from actors like Sam Witwer and Tom Welling hasn't done a commentary since Season 2's box set! The two special featurettes are also rather disappointing with Allison Mack's directorial debut documentary. While it's nice to see what went on behind the scenes, ""Power"" isn't exactly an episode you want to hear the cast and crew praise. The Doomsday suit documentary was also lacking and it would have been more interesting to hear more about the comic history of Doomsday as well as it's comic book creator Dan Jurgens.  The deleted scenes are passable at best.

3568814,5,B001FB4VZS,"If any one season of Smallville made me feel like I was deeply immersed in Superman mythology and was watching a true, live-action version of a DC comic book, Season Eight was it.

Not only is Clark Kent and Lois Lane working at the Daily Planet, but Doomsday, the monster that killed Superman in the comics, is the over-arcing plot this season. He comes in the form of Davis Bloom whom, we learn, experiences these mysterious blackouts as he transforms into the Kryptonian beast and murders anyone that crosses his path.

To make matters worse, Davis has a soft spot for Chloe and despite her best intentions, giving in only sets off a chain of events that screws up her relationship with both him and Clark.

Also introduced this season--and taking the place of Lex Luthor--is Tess Mercer. At first she's as loyal to the Luthor name as anyone, but when she learns what kind of a man Lex Luthor truly was, everything changes and we encounter a woman who is just as evil as her predecessor.

I have to admit I was unsure how Smallville was going to work without Lana Lang and Lex Luthor as key characters, and for the first few episodes, the show did feel a little empty, but that was more than made up for with the breakneck pace the show took and the dark path it led its viewers down while creating the Doomsday saga. With Tess Mercer and Doomsday as the central villains, you forget all about Lex Luthor and instead try to read between the lines to see how he'll one day return as Clark's rightful foe, while watching Tess and Doomsday lead the world into destruction.

I was really happy with how this season turned out after my initial skepticism. The episodes were great, the appearances of other DC alumni like Zatanna, Maxima, Jimmy Olsen, the Legion of Superheroes and more just made Season Eight fantastic.

Like I always say, this show just keeps getting better and better and I cannot wait to see how everything pans out from here on in. Too cool.

Recommended.

Smallville should be renamed Metropolis by now because there is no way they could go back to the early days of a teenage superboy at high school. They are in Metropolis now and must leave Smallville behind.
Now the bad. The worst idea was to bring Lana back to make Clark behave as a dumb teenager again. Everytime Lana turns around all Lois heroic efforts to make a real man of Clark are wasted. But you can ignore the four episodes Lana arc and stay with the best ones, about Lois, Clark and the Green Arrow.
And now the ugly, the last one. That was the worst season ending ever and worst that the exploding baby in season four. The Jimmy that wasn't and the 75 seconds fight with Doomsday should be forgotten. Or erased. That is what Lois should do with that time travel ring. Go back in time and fix things up.
I have the region four edition so no problems with package or sound, everything is fine. And here we get to the bottom line, buy or not buy. If you are a fan of DC Universe or enjoys Erica Durance ultimate Lois Lane this is a must have. But if you want to see the epic confrontation between Superman and Doomsday try the cartoon",1255651200,3,1698,4.359621451104101

Well i bought season 8  the complete set on DVD's I had all ready watched and taped it on VCR's but DVD's are so great the quality is so much better and easy to use. Have season 1-8 got them right here on Amazon.com Do have a lot of time to use as i wish love watching Smallville, Have been a fan of the comet books as far back as i can remember. After working 3.5 life times in every country on the planet and retired at age 36  then just a few years later this show started up and for the first time realized that Tom Welling after seeing the first show it was so great that even the people that write it and all the other one to come are for the first time in history bringing the people that i had met in all the places had been giving them a reason for a united world. This show is so great it stands out and makes people have hope through the actors. Have talked to people every where and they all agree, it has a Hugh affect on there children to try and do some thing about the wrongs they see every day. The show is about self sacrifice, freedom, and hope that they need the values of in this messed up world. If it changes 10 out of 30 people to try and do the right thing and help others out keep up the faith every one. Just wish they had not moved the time slot to Friday from Thursday who knows might stop a lot of the fans, teen's from going out and getting hurt. Love the show like a lot of other people a round the world do keep up the the great work you are doing. Tom  your a great actor for the part in the show.

In the past the writers have certainly missed and made some awful episodes - especially those stupid witch ones with Lana, but everyone was surprisingly good in this season and I watched the entire season within a couple of days. I wish in the ninth season they would introduce Bruce Wayne, as he is part of the future Justice League. In Australia we are so far behind the times so now I have to wait a whole year to watch the next season. You will not be disappointed with season eight, I thought it was fantastic, it looks a great show to work on as well with some behind the scenes stories. Well worth every cent, wished they made more than 22 episodes per year, the storyline could continue for a very long time and with the stars now grown up, it could be called ""Metropolis"" instead of ""Smallville"".",1254441600,,1042,4.432291666666667
3569192,4,B001FB4VZS,"Smalliville Season 8 has come and gone--and is back on DVD / Blu-ray.  Season 8 is more hit than miss.  I enjoyed episodes building on the Clark/Lois relationship, especially a ""throw-away"" episode called ""Committed,"" in which the development of the relationship is revealed through lie-detector-prompted electrocution.  The episodes featuring the development of Davis/Doomsday were interesting.  Unfortunately, the development was cut short, and there was really no day-of-doom that came to fruition, or even really threatened Smallville & Metropolis.  The hits for Season 8, however, were the actual character development of Davis, Clark, and Lois.  Davis/Doomsday especially is a well-acted and interesting character.  (Sidenote: my kids LOVE seeing their Sith-turned-Jedi actor as Davis/Doomsday.  See the video game ""Star Wars: Force Unleashed,"" which has a better plot line than ANY of the new Star Wars episodes, 1-3.)

Now the misses.  There are some AWFUL ideas that actually made it to the small screen, including Lana returning for several painfully bad episodes, especially one entitled ""Power,"" in which Lana becomes a Krypton-powered Super Girl.  Really, this is horrible.  I was *happy* to see her leave the show for good.  Good riddance. My wife thinks the show has already ""jumped the shark"" and this episode seemed to confirm her conclusion, however I hold out hope for a nice finale in Season 9.

It is interesting to watch Clark become the Red-Blue Blur, but there really needs to be quicker advancement to Superman, as hopefully Season 9 will do.  I am being generous by giving this 4 stars.",1254355200,3,1612,5.316205533596838
3569193,3,B001FB4VZS,"Smallville is one of those TV shows where I wait until it comes out on DVD before watching it. The reviews I had seen really had me worried that Season 8 was a big leftdown. I can tell you that it is not. It is actually pretty good (for the most part).

Smallville Season 8 has some really good moments and it continues to build the Clark Kent/Superman character (abeit slowly). I was impressed with the freshness added with some of the new characters like Tess Mercer and Davis Bloom. I really enjoyed the building relationship of Clark and Lois. I have to say that Erica Durance really nailed the Lois Lane part in this season. Overall, the show finally seems to be moving toward something interesting, that being Clark's destiny to take up the role of Superman and start acting like him. The whole first half of this season, up until the episode called Legion was outstanding.

That said. Things change when Lana Lang returns and then ends up sticking around for a while!! In my opinion, she should have left after just two espisodes (after Legion, which would have been perfect). But no, the whole Clark/Lana relationship thing has to flare up again. I am so sick and tired of this!. It never ends! I've gotten to the point where I can't stand the Lana Lang character. I find myself saying things to the TV screen like, ""JUST GO AWAY ALREADY!!!!"" Admittedly, the Clark/Lana thing WAS cute when they were in high school, but they should have ditched her character after Season 4. By far, this was the biggest mistake the writers and creators of this show ever made. The second was that the Lex Luthor character had way too much exposure and also became tiresome. For me, the fact that Lex is mostly absent from Season 8 is a good thing. But I would welcome him back as a villian when the time is right.

That rant aside, Smallville Season 8 is still good. I would easily given it 4 stars instead of 3 if it weren't for Lana Lang. To be fair, I don't blame Kristen Kreuk. You can she really tries hard to make the best of what the writers give her. Unfortunately, the character is just laughable at this point.",1254268800,6,2112,4.466321243523316

3569196,3,B001FB4VZS,"First of all, considering this is the eighth season of a show, it's pretty remarkable that the writers have managed to still pen a decent script from a near empty pool of source material. Not to say the Superman mythos is lacking girth in any way, but creating story arcs that pertain to the pre-superman days are really going to start to stretch, more so than they already are, if they really want to stick to the superman-without-a-cape angle for too much longer. Eventually, if the show manages to survive that long, they are just going to have to inevitably take that plunge, but I digress.

Like I said in the title, when the show this season stays focused on the main plot, it's, in my honest opinion, one of the best seasons yet. However, when it strays from the plot, for example any episode that featured Lana Lang in it, the writing was close to terrible and that character in particular seemed really out of place and unnecessary for any part of the story arc. Same goes for Lex's character. Although, a return would always be welcome as the main villain for the series, it just didn't fit at all with Lex Luther being only a side enemy rather than the real threat of the season.

In any case, I gave this season a 3 out of 5 stars. The main plot was dark, gritty, a little disturbing, and definitely the bloodiest season yet, but very well written.

On that note, I would like to mention that if you enjoy watching the series with your younger children, I would consider taking a pass on this season. The content of this season is much more mature than that of pervious seasons, and there may be too much adult appropriate content for younger viewers (read: 12 and younger) to handle.",1254182400,3,1696,4.482200647249191

Nice.",1253318400,,559,4.54
3569366,3,B001FB4VZS,"The cast returns for a new, and decidedly darker season of the runaway hit series.  After resolving last year's cliffhanger, Clark decides to leave Smallville behind and focus his energy on the Daily Planet, where he can more closely monitor the goings on of the crime-plagued city.  This, of course, means more time for Lois and Clark to gel.  Meanwhile, Tess Mercer steps in to steer the Luthor empire in the absence of Lex.  Oliver Queen returns to continue fighting greed and corruption with the still fledgling Justice League.  And Chloe embarks into some very dark territory in the increasingly tragic love triangle between her, Jimmy Olsen, and new character Davis Bloom.

The producers effectively dodged the bullet of losing Lex from the show.  Cassidy Freeman is an excellent choice to pick up the mantle as Tess Mercer.  She is commanding on screen, strong in the right places, and also vulnerable in just the right measure at all the right times.  Justin Hartely (Queen) and Aaron Ashmore (Olsen) also bring much to the table with expanded roles this season.

The biggest change is that these episodes are much more connected than in the past.  The major arc becomes a leading factor in almost every episode.  Indeed, this season of Smallville might be more aptly dubbed Splitsville, as in splitting the viewers.  On the one hand, there are those who feel this darker and more connected direction is the boost in the arm the show needed to stay fresh.  Then, there are others who miss the former days where each week was its own story, and the larger arc was more of a background factor, mostly relegated to mid-season and season finale episodes.  I can see both sides - there were moments when the epic nature of the season made me nearly forget the teen-angst ridden past it has risen from.  Yet I couldn't help but miss the more lighthearted touches of the former days.

Indeed, this season has a serious lack of humor.  That's not to say it is wholly absent,  but it is rare.  Erica Durrance's fantastic work as Lois is too seldom utilized this season, and the episodes in which she is absent are harder and harder to get through as the season progresses. The few times she is allowed full reign are priceless, including STILLETTO, in which she assumes her own superhero identity to try to break a front page story, or HEX, in which Chloe inadvertently becomes Lois through a wish and a little magic.  Also fun is the return of Linda Lake (Tori Spelling) who forces Clark to reveal his secret to the world in the episode INFAMOUS.

These ""fun"" episodes are rare respites in a season that is mostly focused on the brutal character of Doomsday, who is here from Krypton to destroy the world.  Finding out which human is Doomsday ultimately forces Clark to face his ultimate issue - can he kill a human to save the rest of humanity.  This deep issue consumes the entire second half of the season.  Along the way is a five episode arc that brings back Lana and gives a proper and creatively logical end to the relationship between her and Clark, which is itself consistently tragic for the season.  And the finale, while not quite as big as former finale's, does hint at some major changes to come.

But of course, you cannot mention the finale without discussing what a major letdown it was.  Now, I don't judge it as harshly as others do.  As a tie up to the long running ethics discussion of the season, I actually thought it was pretty good.  The major shock near the end was, in my opinion, quite brilliant - and it made total sense in context of everything that people had been arguing with Clark about.  However, I will agree that the big showdown was woefully disappointing.  Far too short and lackluster.  When Clark and Doomsday landed at the power plant, I figured the gloves would come off and the BIG fight was about to start.  I was shocked when the screen faded to black.  WHAT!!?  This has been coming all season, the destruction of Doomsday, and we don't even see it!?

But, even with this less than stellar final episode, I still think there is hope for the show yet.  They've had their season of ethical issues explored - they've recovered from the loss of Lex - and they've FINALLY rid the world of Lana Lang.  Now, what they need to do is let Season 9 be the end - which means in the course of the next season, Lois and Clark need to become dedicated reporters under the employ of Perry White.

I'm not going to tell you this is an overall bad season, it's not.  There is still plenty to get out of it.  But I will tell you that it's probably the first season I wouldn't go back and watch again.  However, it might serve a larger purpose in being a catalyst for what comes in Season 9.  I just hope they can bring back the fun that the show used to revel in.",1253232000,5,4791,4.52093023255814

The problems are many: Clark needs to grow up and step up to his fate. Clark needs to FLY. (To hell with that no flights no tights rule!) Clark needs to do less wrestling with his ethics and more wrestling with the bad guys. Basically the series needs less angst-y drama and more action. Just to be clear, the actors are doing a fine job, it's the plots I have a problem with.
The biggest let-down for me was in the final episode. They spent ALL SEASON building up Doomsday, and when they finally let him and Clark fight, their fight only lasted ONE MINUTE AND THIRTY FOUR ****-ING SECONDS. And all Clark did was stuff him down a big shaft in the ground. Now Clark is abandoning his humanity. Again. And Zod is back. Again. --Sigh...
In the plus column, I really like that Lois and Clark are starting to warm up to each other.. I have always liked Erica Durance in this role, I think she's perfect for it. She has so much attitude, just like Lois Lane should. I'm glad they've moved on from Lana, (at least, it seems like they have) because we all know she's not ""the one"" for Clark, so let her go. I am interested to see how that goes.
So basically I think the show needs to have less drama and more action. Clark is about 22 by now, right? Kara could fly at 19? I think it's time to get him up in the air. Let Clark and Lois slowly but surely draw closer together, Give Clark some interesting opponents, and above all, next time this show spends an entire FRIGGIN season building up a super villian, their big smackdown had BETTER last longer than 1:34.",1252972800,2,1721,4.171171171171171

Confusion surrounds the disappearance of Lois and too much time is spent in the finale with Chloe and not Clark. All that being said, I loved season eight for being well written and produced.

Why does Louis know who he is?  They should have kept her away from the show until the final season!

On the positive side, the story is starting to pick up...maybe because the show is on its last legs (it has now move to its new home on Fridays).  Everyone know, Fridays is the death of tv.",1252022400,,1019,4.351063829787234
3569448,3,B001FB4VZS,"Someone here touted the 8th season of Smallville as ""inventive.""  How so?  I've watched all the previous seven years of episodes and the first twelve of season 8 but have seen precious few new ideas, just old ones rehashed with different characters.  Clark still loses his powers, constantly runs into kryptonite (and even keeps a box in the barn for some strange reason), ends up in the Phantom Zone and inevitably releases another monster, and finds yet another survivor of Krypton.  Characters continue to get possessed by alien entities, and love affairs always fall short of success.  The pressure for Clark to develop a Superman alter identity is foolish as presented.  For seven seasons he has been the football/super hero to whom everyone turns in a time of crisis, including adults.  He has saved every Smallville damsel in distress and, while he may be a nice guy, is anything but mild-mannered.  The double image Christopher Reeve portrayed so well just isn't possible in the Smallville setting.  Worse, the show continues to strain credulity.  No, I'm not talking about super powers.  You can't watch Superman and not accept that premise.  I have trouble with impossible human timelines.  I'm weary of seeing characters beaten to a pulp and the next day bouncing around like nothing happened.  Lois ends up in the Phantom Zone and - duh! - thinks it was all a dream.  How convenient!  Just how many times can you get knocked out, possessed, or kidnapped into other-worldly environments before you lose your sanity?  And they must develop a new street set.  They've doctored that insanely curved city street six ways from Sunday, but it's still obviously the same location.  It is not that anything in the eight season is bad, it's just that I've seen it all before in one form or another.  Perhaps it's time to let Clark don the cape and tights and let Smallville fade into TV history.",1252022400,8,1897,4.850467289719626
3569449,4,B001FB4VZS,"Overall, I thought this season was great - much better than season 7 but not as spectacular as season 6 (my overall favorite season).  They are finally building up to Lois and Clark and moving past Lana.  The first part of the season was awesome as we finally saw Clark taking a position at the Daily Planet.  The growing flirtation and admiration between Clark and Lois is spectacular.  I also liked that he is inching toward becoming Superman.  The mannerisms that we see in Clark show how he has grown so much from being that high school farmboy in Season 1.  My only complaint was the mid-season Lana arc.  I wish that her story was wrapped up differently and they realized they were not meant for each other rather than they is no way they can physically be together now.  As other have said, this arc took the wind out of a really good first half.

After the Lana arc, the second half of the season in my opinion was great.  Each episode was a must-watch episode for me.  The connection between Davis and the cave walls and incorporating story lines from previous seasons was really quite clever.  I think I was one of the few that even liked the episode of Lois as Stiletto.  I really enjoyed the build-up to the Doomsday fight BUT the final episode opened more questions.  It actually took a second viewing for me to appreciate the final episode as I had a ""say what?!?!?"" moment with the fight and events that occur after the fight during my first viewing.  Also, I was not disappointed that the fight with Doomsday only lasted 1-2 minutes.  This fight wasn't supposed to be the colossal one anyway; that happens after Clark becomes Superman.",1251849600,2,1651,4.545762711864406

The thing they used to do the best, have four or five stories going on inside the big story, were gone. They couldn't even do one story well. If it is a bad this year as last, I hope they end it, and not torture knowing how great season 1-7 were.

3569452,5,B001FB4VZS,"I've been tuning into Smallville since Episode 1, and have been a fan of Superman since I was a little kid.
Smallville is one of the greatest interpretations of Superman ever created in any type of medium (comic book, TV, etc.)  And I was disappointed to see that Smallville Season 8 only received an average rating of 3.5 stars.
Most of the lower rated reviews include complaints about how the show is starting to lose credibility with it's comic counterpart.  In other words it doesn't tie into the comic book that well, the finale of Season 8 was anti climactic, how the writing is starting to dwindle, so on so forth.

Smallville is an INTERPRETATION of the comic book story.  It is NOT the comic book itself.  So to bash Season 8 because it doesn't tie in to the comic that well is pretty silly, cause there have been apparent changes from the comic book since Season 1.  And if you are a long time fan of Smallville, why bash season 8 for something that's been going on since .. well .. forever?

Smallville has always stayed true to the basics of the Superman mythos.  Clark and Lex are enemies.  Lois and Clark will fall in love.  Clark will become Superman, etc.
And I don't believe for a second that Lex is truly dead.  And if he is then damn the writers to hell.  Although it is highly unlikely that Rosenbaum will return to the cast of Smallville, I am for certain we have not heard the last from Lex.  He cant be dead ... come on ... he's Lex Luthor.

The writers have done an amazing job picking up from Season 7.  Despite the loss of Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor), they still do a great job of tying in Lex to the story without actually having him on screen.
Tess Mercer fills in for Lex as the new CEO for Luthercorp.  Pretty much the new ""bad guy"" to give Clark and his friends a hard time.  And although Lex is missed (A LOT!!!)  She's good.  Nuff said.

Also in this season we are treated with the ever growing romance between Lois and Clark.  Love is in the air in season 8!  (Is love ever NOT in the air?)  But I have always admired Smallville for it's character development, especially with Clark's love interests (well mostly Lana).  But Lois and Clark are as equally intoxicating to watch as Lana and Clark in previous seasons.
Erica Durance plays the best Lois Lane I have ever seen.  She nails her personality flawlessly.  Naive, cocky, rude, Clarks opposite ... his perfect match.

And what about the final battle between Doomsday in the Season Finale?  What about it?  Nothing short of ... awesome can you say?  Many complained that the battle was too short and anti climactic.  It depends on how you see it.  In my opinion, the battle had started the day Clark met Davis Bloome (Doomsday).  It wasn't the physical battle so much as it was the emotional battle that Clark went through, and the writers did a superb job presenting it.
Can Clark overcome the beast without killing him?
Time and time again through Season 8, Clark is tempted by his friends, and even his fellow heroes that sometimes the only way to save the day is to kill.  That killing is a sacrifice a hero has to make once in a while to benefit the greater good of mankind.
But Clark shows why he isn't a hero.  He shows why he is a superhero.  He can make the decisions that no one else can make, not even heroes like Green Arrow.  That there is always a way to save the world without crossing the line, and that a life is a life no matter who it may be.

Season 8 is awesome, and even after 8 years, Smallville has not lost its quality when compared with previous seasons.  The drive of the show, the ambition of the show has remained the same.

If you are a fan of Smallville don't compare it to other mediums of Superman, but cherish as is.

If you do you won't be disappointed.  5 stars.",1251676800,37,3789,4.354285714285714

My wife was dissapointed that Lex is gone.  Also she felt that, as do I, that the Justice League needs to come out to play more.  They are a large part of the lore of Superman.  This season seems like it is becoming something like a One Tree Hill or some other teen angst tv show more then it used to be.

Also, as others have stated the package design is terrible.  Mine had SIX broken pieces of plastic and the whole bottom part where the bottom cylinder fits down was totally shattered.  The first 4 seasons are great packages, after that the package has gotten terrible.

I emailed the WB to let them know about my broken package but of course no response, as they already have my money I assume.

So overall would almost give this season a three as it is OK, barely, but the package design knocks it down a star, so 2 stars it is.",1251504000,8,961,4.096256684491979
3569454,4,B001FB4VZS,"Smallville is the rare show that actually seems to genuinely improve with age, season after season.  There was a time when I believed that the life of the show was being artificially extended solely for profit, but the acting and production value is genuinely excellent, and years later this is still one of my favorite shows.

Tom Welling as ""Clark Kent"" is excellent.  I literally do not think they could have chosen a better person for the role.  To me he embodies who the character is and he has the acting ability to easily pull off the role and leave the viewer wanting more.  As I watch ""Clark"" go through his highs and lows on the show, it is as if I am experiencing those same events myself, the good and the bad, and I love it.

Erica Durance has become every bit as good in her role as ""Lois Lane"" as Tom Welling is at being ""Clark Kent"".  She is the penultimate Lois and this season really brings that home.  The flirtatious and romantic moments between the two characters are magical and as the viewer you find yourself emotionally tangled up in the drama onscreen, and wondering what's going to happen next.

They have managed to take the essence of the classic Superman movies and comic books and modernize it for today's audience, but at the same time they have perfected the formula, to the extent that this is the version of the mythology that I prefer above all others, this is the Superman that I would want my kids to grow up watching and listening to and admiring.

The special effects are excellent, as always, but as I said, the thing that has made this season for me, so far, are the little details, the story, the great acting, and the interaction between the various characters, the wonderful escalation of character relationships that have been years in the making.

The downside of loving the show this much is that I know one day it will come to an end and I will be heart-broken.

There is a problem accessing the episode menu for these blu-rays, which means that unless you watch each disk all the way through, when you come back later in the day to continue watching, or the next day, you will have to search through each disk, chapter by chapter to find the episode that you stopped at.  This is why I rated the blu-ray version of this season 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5 out of 5, and this is the only thing that makes this season less then perfect, in my opinion.",1251504000,3,2400,4.414965986394558

Americans had to go to another region (country) to get/buy a version with English subtitles.

Warner Brothers, one of the most prestigious movie studios in the world,  should be ashamed to release a DVD and/or a DVD Box set in the United States that deliberately excludes a segment of the American viewing public; i.e. the hearing impaired.. I also know there are people who watch DVDs with the subtitles on in order to fully enjoy and understand the dialogue even though they are not hearing impaired.

I wish that that all viewers of Warner Brother products would convey the public's displeasure to Warner Brother's upper management.  Shame.  Shame.

While not working on his desk on the Daily Planet or forging a special relationship with Lois Lane (Erica Durance), Clark Kent (Tom Welling) swoops to the recue as the helpful hero known as the Red-Blue Blur. Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman), the new CEO of LuthorCorp, searches for the missing Lex Luthor. The relationship between Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore) is threatened by the mysterious David Bloome (Sam Witwer) who struggles more and more to control the unstoppable beast within him. If you've been following the series, you'll know that it has many ups and downs but overall the eighth season proves to be more entertaining than the previous one. After the departures of cast regulars Kristin Kreuk and Michael Rosenbaum, there was some concern if the series would hold up in this season. There are some interesting episodes and appearances of familiar DC Comics characters. The season-long story builds up nicely but the big climatic finish was somewhat ineffective.

3569561,3,B001FB4VZS,"Smallville has always been a guilty pleasure for me. Usually I don't care for shows that don't have good writing or are too unrealistic. Smallville was fairly well cast and had some great episodes over the years. Unfortunately in between there have been a number of mediocre and downright bad episodes. The show seems to have run its course, and yet fails to ever really resolve anything. Clark is still not Superman, although it seems like he could be, and really should have been by now.
The loss of almost the entire original cast is a huge blow to the show. Carks parents, the Luthors, Lana, and Pete, are all gone. Even recent additions like Brainiac and Kara are off the show. The only initial character's left are Chole and Clark.
I know they want to milk this show for all they can get before canceling it, but the loss of the major antagonists (the Luthors), had left a huge hole in the show. This combined with Clark's infuriating slow journey to becoming Superman, have made this show even more difficult to watch.
There are too many unbelievable storylines, and too many storylines that don't go anywhere and or just seem to be forgotten.
This season seemed like it was going to be the last, and I hope they decide to conclude the show soon and give it a proper ending.",1251072000,5,1281,4.54978354978355
3569562,3,B001FB4VZS,"Season 8 is the first time that Smallville has left me disappointed.  Every other season deserves a 4 or 5 star rating (or even 6!), but season 8 just didn't pack the same punch.  This season did NOT have the ""I can't wait until next week's show"" feel to it.

I firmly believe that the producers originally intended Season 7 to be the finale.  They knew ahead of time that Michael Rosenbaum would not be returning and the script seemed to tie storylines from the previous seasons together through the Veritas plot.  My unsubstantiated guess is that Millar/Gough left the show because it got picked up for this 8th season and Millar/Gough didn't like where the series was going with it's over-arching plot (and, as a result, they were sort of ousted by CW execs due to creative differences).  In any case, season 7 was surprisingly fantastic and the finale left me on the edge of my seat.

Season 8 starts out by disappointing from the get go.  The way to control the Traveler was for Clark to once again lose his powers?  Really?  Again?  All of that build up in Season 7, which was made to sound like the world would end if Lex activated this control, was about Clark losing his powers?  I'm sorry, but Clark losing his powers has happened numerous times throughout the series and was a definite slap in the face to Season 7.

There were some decent things with Season 8.  I like how Kara was brought back for a farewell episode.  I also commend how Lana returned so that they could finish her storyline and not just leave her character hanging.  That said, the whole superpowers equal to Clark idea was a bit much for me (my opinion is that they should have made Clark realize he wasn't truly in love with her), but I was actually ok with how Lana's return was done overall.  I also enjoyed the development of Oliver and his clashes with Clark.

I think Tess Mercer's character was ok - but she simply cannot ever equal the evil that Lex brought.  I truly missed Lionel's character (John Glover was the best actor in the series).  Davis Bloome was solid, but the Doomsday part of him (when he actually turned into Doomsday) was underwhelming (especially in the finale - more on that below).  I have problems when they leave plotlines unfinished.  For example, Clark promised to help John Jones, aka the Martian Manhunter, get his powers back after the sun nullified them.  Nothing more ever came of that and, except for one episode, John Jones was ignored.  Also, Chloe ""found herself"" by becoming in charge of the Watchtower.  However, she was never really seen performing this new role.  These unfinished plotlines weren't even teased to leave us hanging - they were just never touched again.

The season finale was absolutely the worst EVER for Smallville.  The epic battle between Doomsday and Clark lasted about 2 seconds!!  I don't care that the show didn't follow the comics by not having Doomsday kill Clark, but the whole season lead up to this supposed to be mega-fight, which panned out to be nothing of the sort.  Then Clark shows up and can't remember much of the fight?  That's because there really wasn't one!!  Horrible.  What was with Lois disappearing and time traveling??  The first ring could only be activated by Clark.  I know this was a replacement, but I'm thinking it would be constructed the same way which means I'm not buying her zipping off somewhere (it just seemed like the writers couldn't come up with anything else).  So Jimmy Olsen wasn't Jimmy Olsen after all?  Then why was he named Jimmy Olsen?  Chloe then gives his camera to his younger brother who is the real Jimmy Olsen - so, both brothers are named Jimmy?  That's just bad writing to me.  Clark just walks off to end the season?  Not much of a cliffhanger.  Half of the Justice League shows up but are barely featured (especially Bart, how hasn't been on the show in several years).  Finally, bringing Zod back?  There's so many other ways they could have gone other than to bring back Zod (who Clark has already beaten in Season 6).  Maybe the Zod plot will work out, but I'm skeptical based on how poorly Season 8 ended.

Bottomline, I know the writers/producers were somewhat handcuffed with losing so many of the shows orignal characters (after all, only Clark and Chloe remain!).  I also don't mind that they stray from the real comic book story (in fact, I like how Smallville has it's own unique plots).  However, many opportunities were missed and others were bungled in Season 8.  Smallville's move to Friday night for Season 9 is not a good sign and ratings will probably dip (which does not bode well for a season 10).  I will still be watching faithfully though with the hope that season 8 was an aberration from the amazing 7 previous seasons.  Regardless, Smallville will likely always remain my favorite TV shows.",1250985600,5,4824,4.636363636363637
3569563,4,B001FB4VZS,"If you are already looking at this page, you have probably made up your mind on whether or not you are going to buy Smallville Season 8. For those who haven't decided let me see if I can help. As an avid Smallville and Superman fan (sidenote: I've got a S Crest Tattoo and superman complex to boot) I love the direction Smallville has taken in recent seasons. They gave us growth in characters and dramatic stories and the always enjoyable easter eggs of DC characters to grace the small screen. The question you should be asking yourself while you decide, is whether or not this season is worth the buy as a BOX SET, as oppose buying singular episodes. Its the same specials as previous sets (few commentaries, deleted scenes), but nothing out of the ordinary.

Should this season be among your Smallville collection? Is it worth remembering? In my opinion yes! The exploration of Jimmy Olsen's character was wonderful and dark and his turbulant relationship with Chloe was good departure from Lana/Clark on/off dibacle. Lois was actually utilized effectively to amazing results. Tess Mercer was an interesting villianess to say the least, and Doomsday was pulled off well in live action. Supergirl returned and left gracefully (however, I will miss this Girl of Steel). And the ""Legionaries"" and ""Injustice League"" episodes and Zatanna apperance were fun, campy, and further developed Clark as a character and Hero. There are many things that should drive you to get the Season as a whole. However, drawbacks include the lackluster Lana and Clark drama/arc...again and the sort of anticlimactic season finale (for me at least). All that we saw this season and we get a weak Justice League appearance/cameo, the endless reference to the red/blue blur, and the disappearance and death of staple Smallville characters. To die hard fans, Clark/Superman was supposed to die at the hands of Doomsday. Way to mess with comicbook lore, writers.

These flaws however will not deter me from getting Season 8 and it shouldn't deter you. Hopefully as season 9 draws near, these flaws will be addressed and Superman will be unleashed. The least they can do is give Clark glasses...isn't it about time?",1250985600,6,2190,4.948369565217392

3569565,5,B001FB4VZS,"I must admit that I've never been a big time CW viewer but for three yrs running now I've gradually got hooked on this show.  While it can be downright confusing following the plot and storylines coming late to this series I find it the most enjoyable weekly series viewing.  This show has it all and the HD Quality is fantastic as are the beautiful people cast in the roles we view.  It sort of reminds me when I was younger and lived close to where I worked and I'd go home for lunch and view All My Children and got addicted viewing it.  This thing has many soap opera elements that bait you and may annoy but at the same time baits you to continue watching.

I've never viewed a series that from season to season they alter the thing so much but you continue following though your thoughts may be where the hell this person went especially when they do the reruns out of sequence.  This is simply the best looking group of people I've ever seen on TV and damn why isn't Tom Weller doing Superman on the big screen? Makes one wonder what they could do with this with a Big Screen budget and Tom Weller deserves it and while I'm a guy and not gay I must say this guy is one of the best looking men on screen and he plays the role amazingly well - though at times the constrast can be annoying where they make him too vulnerable or to be blunt too much a pussy for someone that's Superman but when needed he grows a pair and prevails.  While it irks me that they don't have him flying I find it now pleasurable to see them having him evolve and grow and perhaps he finds that flying is always faster than running.;)

I find most serial programming to be boring and redundant at my mid life age but the quirky changing storyline keeps me hooked and the quality of this show for something on CW is fantastic and how they do it week after week.  Has anyone else wanted Superman to grab Chloe and get it on - she is hot in a sort of girl next door way! Smallville has great genetic code as it's rare you find any cast member that's not beautiful and now we get a Justice League added to the mix!  I do miss Lex Luther though I must admit but they keep him in the mix with no physical presence to bring him back to life if they choose much like a good Soap Opera does.

Considering my viewing was pretty much limited to the past 3 years it makes me wonder what I missed from the first five seasons but has this showed matured well despite it making it challenging to follow the constant changing storyline and character rotations - somehow they do it and it works for me.

I'll gladly view season 9 on Friday nights and gradually add a Blu-Ray library as I find the rest of Friday Night viewing truly sucks as Ghost Whisperer has gotten a little kooky and redundant SOSO.  The cast on Smallville and the production quality and Soap Opera Sci-fi make it a pleasure to enjoy and nothing else on TV compares outside the Tudors series on Showtime another sort of brutal Superman with a Soap flare.

Now i have to admit that i am a little young for the comic, however i am huge Lois & Clark fan (starring Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher). My mom and me would watch it every sunday and i have always loved superman since i was a kid. When Smallville started out i was beyond exstatic and my stepdad fills me in on how the show is or isn't like the comic. He on the other hand remembers the comic vividly and i like to hear just how on track they are based on the comics. I will admit i was a little sad about the season finale, but once i was told about how it was impossible for Jimmy to know Clark at that age was 21st century and not based off the comic. Sammie (another comic friend of mine) explained the comic version to me and it made since why they killed him off and also why they showed Chloe handing Jimmy's little brother his camera. I was proud of the Legion of Superhero's i am a little familiar with them and even more familiar with them now. I was even more happy about doomsday. Being able to see the doomsday event tells me that we are getting somewhere and the next seasons should better than ever. If you weren't happy with Smallville then maybe NOW is the time to come back, because they are doing big things and we are getting to see Clark Kent transform into Superman. LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF IT!!!

 I also wanted to add about the Lois Lane disappearing act. I think that when Lois returns she will not remember Clark and will meet him for the first time (or second) at the Daily Planet. I bring this up, because this was really bugging another friend of mine who couldn't understand why they brought lois in this series so early. I think it was to introduce us to her and explain their sudden attraction. Of course i may be wrong, but that's what i think will happen.",1250726400,3,1803,4.208092485549133
3569626,4,B001FB4VZS,"This season of Smallville really surprised me. I wasn't really crazy about the season premiere because they went the whole ""Clark loses his powers"" angle again, but after that the season really took off. Perhaps the biggest surprise, was how well they pulled off all of the doomsday stuff which I was really skeptical about. I know this season wasn't perfect (none of them are) but I mean for a comic geek this season was really a new starting point. They included the Legion of Superheroes, Introduced the Red Blue Blur Concept, and established just why the Smallville version of Jimmy Olsen was so much older than the comic version. I know people have their problems with the finale but ultimately that finale did more right than wrong, and to get mad simply because the fight was a little lacking is a being overly critical. Overall if you're a Smallville fan this season should definitely keep you entertained, it's the best season since season 5.",1250726400,,951,4.7696969696969695
3569627,3,B001FB4VZS,"Since Smallville came upon the scene over 8 years ago, I have purchased every season except for Season 8, as my wife and myself have enjoyed watching them. As for some of the story lines Season 8 spawned, I hate the fact that Lex was killed off even before Clark has donned the red and blue tights. Lex was a major enemy towards Clark. Bringing in the Tess character, and with Lex and Lana both gone I found the some of the stories weak and lacking excitement. The Lex character even though Mike Rosenbaum left, they should consider resurrecting his character to exact revenge on Clark(Superman).As for the Doomsday character in Season 8 they did well with that. I do hope that Season 9 will introduce more villian's and intrigue to strengthen the series were I feel Season 8 lacked. I will buy Season 8 to add it to my collection, and recap the season in order to prepare for Season 9.",1250640000,2,886,4.4753086419753085

Things in season 8 and 9 are begining to be much more centralized into who Clark will eventually become, the universe is much more rich with the effects and action of the show picking up some serious ground. Has anyone seen the promo for season 9!? Smallville has finally grown a pair.

The only thing I craved for was to see more of the Justice League in this season... and when the H-E-double hockey sticks is Bruce and Diana showing up!?

But all and all I want.... More Clark, Lois and big bads testing Clark's abilities!! (Along with solid good stories of course.) Anyone who is basicly male, a Clark AND Superman fan and holds a ratings box... jump on board for buying this DVD set and tuning in for season 9!

Lois and Clark are spendign more time together working for the Daily Planet and you can see sparks between them. I really like Davis as Doomsday and you'll learn something very important about Jimmy. The Justice League are back in this season and you'll see some from the future. Above all, I thought this was a very good season with action.",1248566400,3,529,4.408163265306122

3569633,5,B001FB4VZS,"This was a great season,a stunning surprise given the fact that Miles/Gough, the original producers had left. Most thought the show would go down the tubes, but it did not.  In fact, it only got better.

The season had a film noir look to it, and much darker plot lines.  The Doomsday arc is the best, the Lana arc is the the worst--but we had to deal with her somehow.

Outstanding is the acting of Sam Witwer who plays Davis/Doomsday.  He gave a fresh take on innocence turning evil.  The Lois/Clark relationship definitely improved.  Tom Welling has anchored this series superbly since its beginning.  He deserves far more credit then he gets for keeping Smallville a solid dramatic slhow.

Most folks, me included, would welcome a complete metamorphosis of Clark into Superman, but the writers gave us much more this season than I thought.  Some iconic images are introduced and the finale is rather shocking--and satisfying.

No one thought the show would go on this long.  To its credit, Smallville remains an excellent show.  If you have not seen this season, this is a must view; if you have, buy the DVD and enjoy it all a second time around.",1248134400,2,1151,4.695
3569634,5,B001FB4VZS,"I love Smallville and have watched it from the beginning.  I think season 8 was outstanding.  I was happy to see Lana go but sad about Lex leaving.  I loved the whole Doomsday story and actually cried when I thought he died (even though I knew they couldn't kill him off for real).  Alot of people are trashing this season but I don't understand why.  It was alot of fun and very exciting.  I hope they renew it for a 10th season.  I think people are comparing the series too much to the comics.  So what if it doesn't follow the Superman story?  It's supposed to be fun and entertaining and that's what it is.  I liked when they brought Supergirl into the picture. She was great and was a neat twist to the show.  I hope they bring her back for a guest appearance during the final season (which hopefully won't be until season 10 at least!!)
Anyway, Smallville is the only show I watch faithfully.  The last series I watched was Buffy the Vampire Slayer so once Smallville is gone I will just have my DVDs....  I can't wait for season 9!!!!",1246579200,8,1041,4.304123711340206
3569755,5,B001FB4VZS,"First and most important, I loved this season and can't wait to watch it again to catch on to some of the things the fly by me when it's live.

I started watching live in season 6 and before it ended, I had bought every season on dvd.  I still cannot wait until the dvd comes out for every new season.  I know it has changed over time, and is different every season but that is because actors get older, characters graduate high school and relationships change and grow.  When a show is this great, year after year, there's bound to be people who wish it was always the same, and therefore absolutely as great always because it is exactly the same.  Some episodes are better than others, and there are always growing pains in great shows but I don't see that as bad - every season is different for some reason or another.  But being a new fan who watched all seasons in one year, in a row, I see the changes and the growth all together at once and I absolutely love it.  I understand wanting it to be the same because it is so great from the beginning but to call for such a great show to be cancelled because it is different,  is just heartbreaking.  Real, true fans who don't like some episodes or seasons, can forgive and come back or just don't watch but I've had many favorites that drifted and then had episodes or further seasons that I loved.

All too often great shows aren't even given a chance to air two or three episodes, much less two or three seasons to grow a decent fan base - or like this year in particular, many with good-even great ratings are cancelled for unknown reasons.  With the trash on tv these days, Smallville is miles above 99% of the shows and should certainly not be cancelled.  I give CW huge kudos for giving Smallville and Supernatural a chance, and keeping them on TV when there is such pressure to cancel anything that doesn't hit American Idol or Grey's Anatomy season 1 ratings because apparently networks tend to think if they aren't number one, the next show they try will most certainly be number one and therefore no matter how good, no matter how decent the ratings, if they aren't number one, they get canned without a second thought.  Unique shows, like Smallville and Supernatural are particularly vulnerable because they aren't yet another Law and Order or CSI.  I like CSI and L&O but that doesn't mean I don't want some variety in my choice of shows.  I don't want a copy of every show that's popular, I just want great shows and I am so thankful to have that in  Smallville.  I love this show because it is different every week, has surprises that fit the show, and have terrific actors and characters.  I Love this season, as much as all the others.",1246320000,6,2703,4.393574297188755
3569756,4,B001FB4VZS,"I've been an avid Smallville watcher for years. Each season, I keep hoping that they will get closer and closer to the Superman mythos, and this year, they finally got close-as-can-be. Sure, ""no flights, no tights"" held true, but the incorporation of a semi-relistic and utterly BRUTAL looking Doomsday went far.

This season had some really amazing moments with Lois and Clark, and some great inclusion of other DC characters...

That said, the arc with Lana was unneeded. And the series does suffer a bit with the loss of Michael Rosenbaum as Lex, though not as devastatingly as I would have imagined at first. The real problem, (Spoiler-alert)though, comes with how the end of the Doomsday angle is handled. They really did build it up like they would finally have a true EPIC ending to a season (Smallville is plauged by terrible season finales that are ALWAYS a let down, and this one is no different... in fact it may be worse, because they did all the right things leading up to the fight with Doomsday), however, the ""fight"" with Doomsday takes up little more than a minute of screen time and REALLY sucked the life out of the season.

They've really got to get over the epic build up and pansy delivery on their season finales. We NEEDED to see Clark and Doomsday rumble for a half an hour across many states... we got a mind-numbing single attack finish...

Overall, however, the season was stellar. I could finally see myself re-watching this season over again. I'm really excited to see where season 9 ends things.",1246233600,2,1526,4.725563909774436
3569757,5,B001FB4VZS,"I am one of the rare ""Smallville"" fans that greatly prefer the darker seasons of late to the light-hearted, freak-of-the-week seasons that the show started with. Season 8 introduced the marvelous Tess Mercer (as excellently portrayed by Cassidy Freeman) who filled the shoes of an MIA Lex Luthor with more charisma and grace than, dare I say it, the great Michael Rosenbaum in the past couple seasons. Also among the characters this year is Davis ""Doomsday"" Bloome, who is taken to the next level by Sam Witwer, who plays the role in such a way that the viewers can actually sympathize for the tortured, lonely murderer that Davis has unfortunately become.

There are only two problems that I have with season 8. The first is that around episodes 8.03-8.05, the show lagged. A lot. The episodes, I thought, were quite boring and just not the best work that the ""Smallville"" writers have put forth. Specifically 8.03 ""Toxic,"" which could've been a fantastic exploration of Justin Hartley's Oliver ""Green Arrow"" Queen character but ended up being a bland, practical snorefest.

The second problem is the Lana-arc in episodes 8.10-8.14. While 8.10 ""Bride,"" 8.11 ""Legion,"" and 8.12 ""Bulletproof"" were all outstanding and Kristin Kreuk delivered on every front in her reprisal as Lana Lang, the storyline of giving Lana super powers was extremely unwelcome to most fans (myself included) and, if anything, ruined what could've been a perfect end to the lengthy Clark/Lana storyline that has haunted ""Smallville"" since the first episode. 8.14 ""Requiem"" is a good episode, mind you, but the poorly done super! Lana storyline brings it and 8.13 ""Power"" down as the worst episodes of the season.

Now, there are definitely some blockbuster episodes that were perfect, in my eyes. The entire slew of episodes from 8.15 to 8.21 were brilliant - specifically 8.15 ""Infamous,"" 8.16 ""Turbulence"" (a brilliant and emotionally raw exploration of the characters - specifically Jimmy Olsen), 8.18 ""Eternal,"" and 8.21 ""Injustice."" Watching this season, I was in awe at how much the actors and actresses - and their characters - have grown since they were first introduced to us and I have yet to be disappointed by the work turned in by the fantastic Tom Welling, the outstanding Allison Mack, and the stunning Erica Durance.

Overall, I highly recommend that new viewers catch this season when its on sale and all ""Smallville"" fans should purchase this boxset as soon as it's released. As we enter season 9, which may very well be our last ""Smallville"" season, I have high hopes that the show will kick it into high gear and go out with a bang.",1245888000,93,2626,4.961363636363636
3569758,3,B001FB4VZS,"Season 8: I like the beginning more than the end.  I loved where things were going with Lois.  After all, she, NOT Lana, was the love of Superman's life. Lana was never more than Clark's high school girlfriend.  I agree with krypton kid's review, where he said the writers could have used the 5 episodes with Kristen Kreuk to allow Clark to see that he was really in love with Lois.  Instead, they completely cooled down a hot relationship with his head back into Lana, as if it wasn't for the krypton keeping them apart, he would have stayed with her.  Humbug!  This would have been a great way to have brought Erica Durance back in. Instead, there was no way you could believe Clark was in love with her after the 5 episodes with Lana. Made her seem like seconds. Of course, the fact that she was off the show for over a month after the terrific Bride episode was a big mistake, IMHO.

So... I think the show didn't go where it could have gone. I was hoping to see Clark finally fly, Lois step up in their relationship (I loved the episode ""Committed"" where she has to admit to Clark that she loved him), and I would have liked to see them bring in Perry White. After 8 years, they can advance Clark's age a bit (they do not have to stick to a High School year per season mentality) and get him into the meat of being a hero. In the comic books, Clark was never so unsure of himself as Tom Welling is made to play him. I was more than fed up of seeing him so needy and insecure all the time. I was ready to see him become a force to be reckoned with.",1245801600,7,1552,4.136212624584718
3569759,2,B001FB4VZS,"Hello smallville fans I wanted to give my review on season 8. I'm along with the general consenus among Smallville fans that this has probably been the worst season so far. The stories were all over the place, the special effects are pretty much non existent, and the show overall is just nothing like the show I have enjoyed for the past seven seasons. I have never watched a show for this long and now I feel like I want to see how it all ends but it is getting excruciating to watch. The moment I knew this show jumped the shark was when they had a stand in for Lex Luthor and all you could see was a bald head and one eye. Stand ins for actors that have left a show is definitely a sign of maybe it's time to end the show. I have to say if this show can't get better it should end. The most hard to swallow part is how far and fast the quality of the show has fallen in one season. I don't know why a show that is based on a character with 70 years of history behind it cant last for more than 7 seasons without falling into mediocrity. Seriously a character does not become an American icon without depth. This season has more filler episodes than episodes with some purpose to the season's overall story arc. It's like they had more episodes than ideas for episodes,how the hell does that happen with a 70 year old character.
In conclusion I will watch next season and buy this season's DVD to have the complete series so far but I cannot recommend this season to anyone other than for the same reason I am buying it.",1245801600,7,1523,4.1661016949152545
3569760,4,B001FB4VZS,"Season 8 of Smallville isn't the best, but it isn't the worst in my opinion. What made me enjoy this season so much was that they're finally putting more clois scenes. The past seasons of Clark being with Lana was just plain boring and annoying. Lana use to be so sweet and kind, but as the seasons went her character was becoming so annoying that i stopped watching this show until season 8. Clark's pining over Lana was also becoming very annoying. Clark and Lois was what made me continue watching Smallville. Tom Welling and Erica Durance's chemistry was just pure bliss this season. Their scenes together are the greatest and always put a smile on my face. The first 10 episodes were good, but the Clana arc was when the show screwed up. What disappointed me was that the writers could have made Clark realize his feelings for Lois and break things off with Lana. But, no we got Clark still having feelings for Lana and kissing and having sex with her. I was so disgusted and angry that i almost broke the remote. After that the show kept making bad episode after the other. There were episodes that were pretty good and others that disappointed me like Doomsday. Doomsday was a pretty bad season finale and got my hopes way too up. Well hopefully next season won't mess around and bring back Lana. Blame the writers, blame the budget, but don't blame the actors and actresses because I think they did a wonderful job.",1245801600,4,1423,4.5625
3569761,1,B001FB4VZS,"Let me start out by saying that I have faithfuly watched Smallville since season one and have collected every season up until season seven.  I hate to say it... and I might get booed for it, but I think the show should have been canceled after season six.  Not abruptly canceled by the network, but the creators and producers of the show should have gave Smallville a proper ending.  Season seven wasn't as bad as season eight, but it was starting to show signs that the creators were running out of ideas and I feel like they were going to far with Clarks role as a superhero without him becoming the Superman that we know he was destined to be.  Now, before I break that down... let me tell you a little about myself.  I love comic books, but with 974 movies on shelf, I think its safe to say I'm a movie lover also.  What this means is, though I hate to see a movie about a comic book character change important details, as a movie lover I usually understand why that change was made.  In the begining I felt like Smallville was real respectable to both the comic book and even more so to the original Superman movies.  But the last few seasons they have really ignored that.  Main example is the appearance of Doomsday.  Really?  The monster that kills Superman makes an appearance on Smallville.  Okay, let me stop... I can go on forever.  Let me end by saying that season eight simply did not have me wanting to see what happen next.  I still have the last few episodes on my DVR, because I simply don't care to watch them.  There used to be a time when I wouldnt even have to record the episodes on my DVR... I had to watch it when I came on.  This show is now just real corny and I cant really see them fixing it.  Though I hate when my favorite shows are canceled, there are a few that end right and on good/powerful note.  I just wish Smallville had ended when it was still good, now I fear that the show will just fade away.  Oh, and I bet you all the actors that have already left felt like the season were getting weaker and there absence only made it worse.",1245456000,13,2071,4.223918575063613
3569762,1,B001FB4VZS,"I've been watching Smallville since Season One, and this is, by far, the most disappointing season I can recall.  Last year, the show lost its creators, Al Gough and Miles Millar, its main villain Lex Luthor, played by Michael Rosenbaum, and its leading lady Kristin Kreuk, who played Lana Lang.  The new producers are inexperienced, and imo, the quality of the show suffered big time as a result.

First and foremost, don't be fooled by the DVD cover.  This season definitely isn't about Clark and Lois.  She's only in 12 of the episodes, and basically, her character's treated as a joke.  For instance, she dresses up in a tight leathery outfit as a phony superhero called ""Stiletto.""  Guess why.

Lois has published no stories of note, Clark hardly even shows up for work at the Daily Planet, and he and Lois don't have that many scenes together.  They work, not for Perry White, but for a noname villain called Tess.

The one bright spot in the whole season is the villain called Doomsday, the ultimate killing machine who, in the comics, destroys Superman.  The writers had the brilliant idea to make this villain have an alter ego who yearned to reject his evil nature.  They set up a wonderful triangle with Doomsday, Clark and the real leading lady of the season. (For those who haven't watched this show much, that's not Lois, but a character called ""Chloe"").  Yet, the producers managed to bungle even that.  SPOILER WARNING>>>>

The big fight in the finale between Superman and Doomsday lasts about one minute, and Clark doesn't die.  Keep in mind, this was a season-long storyline, and up to that minute, I thought it was really well done.  And yet, it ended with....pretty much nothing.  I was speechless.  Then there's the surprise out-of-your-hat revelation that ""Jimmy Olsen"" is, in fact, not the real deal, and Clark deciding, inexplicably, to reject humanity at the end, even though it means abandoning his best friend when she needs him most.

The series finale for this season not only set a record low for the eight-year history of the series, it's also the second-lowest rated episode in the whole run of the show.  In fact, the ratings slid down so much for this season that the CW has relegated this show to the ignominious ""Friday night"" slot next year.

There is no way I would ever consider buying this DVD set.  In fact, I'd reject it as a gift.",1245196800,34,2373,4.706310679611651
3569763,5,B001FB4VZS,"My title says it all.  This was definitely a very different season of Smallville due to the many cast and crew changes, and depending on the kind of person you are (or maybe the mood you're in when you watch it?) you either absolutely love this season, or you hated it with a fiery passion.

I probably shouldn't have given the season a full 5 stars because of this, but I, personally, fall into the ""loved it"" category, and four stars would be a little too harsh for me.  Also, I think this season deserves a higher rating than the previous season (which at the time I'm writing this...isn't the case) so I'm cheating a bit to let the overall rating go up.  ;)

But, I will say that there are plenty of things that could have been done better, and things that I didn't necessarily like--but overall, it was a much better experience and a vast improvement over the last couple of seasons in terms of characterization and storylines.  Mostly.

You might hate this season, because the show is drastically different than the first three seasons or so...but I, personally, like many of the changes.  Comic book lore is heavier and, in some ways, enhanced, and Clark's character is just better in every way.  He's more heroic, and finally takes REAL steps to becoming Superman.  The supporting characters also shine, including the two new characters, Tess and Davis, who are portrayed by two of the most talented actors Smallville has had...well, ever.  Chloe goes through a whole range of emotions that you may admire or despise (going along with the love it/hate it theme of the season), and Lois becomes a much more rounded character (another thing some people complained about...but made her more likable to me).  It would be easy to hate Jimmy towards the end of the season, but he still has plenty of places to shine during the first half, such as ""Identity"", ""Abyss"", and ""Bride"", where he displays a lot of earnestness and heroism many of the other supporting characters start to lack as the series gets darker.  Oliver gets very dark this season as well, which is still a little iffy at this point.  I'll have to see how it gets resolved next season; at this point, things are still up in the air for him and I'm not sure where he's going.

I do think most of the hatred in this season either comes from the mid-season Lana swan song or the finale.  Most of the other missteps in this season were relatively unimportant in the overall scheme of things, and even the weakest episodes weren't really that bad.  The Lana arc, which runs from episode 10-14 (though the major focus of debate occurs in ""Bulletproof"", ""Power"", and ""Requiem""), was necessary to close the plot threads of Lana Lang and Lex Luthor, considering that at the time this may have been the final season.  However, coming right smack in the middle of the season sort of derailed what had been a very quickly moving and climactic story arc from the first ten superb episodes, thus leaving us feeling a little off-kilter when our focus is shifted away from Chloe, Lois, and Doomsday, and returns back to the Clark/Lana/Lex triangle that hadn't been visited for quite a while.  Many reasons the first half of the season was so good was because of its sense of freshness, so by revisiting older stories right when everything seemed to be going at a great pace...it makes it hard to not be in a bad mood when watching these episodes.

However, despite what criticism the closure of Lana and Lex's stories in ""Requiem"" gets, it really isn't all that bad if you look at it from the right perspective.  Lana and Clark's relationship FINALLY comes full circle, after seven years of on-off drama, and even though the supersuit plot device was a little...weird...it did at least allow Lana to get redemption after the past couple of years really screwed with her character.  That, and the general coolness factor of reflecting elements of the Pilot episode, made Lana's exit be more bittersweet than overly melodramatic.  It's a sad ending that had to happen, but at least you know that Lana finally gets what she wants in the end--to be able to both protect herself AND protect others.

As for Lex, the writers had to struggle with closing out his storyline, at least for the time being, without Michael Rosenbaum.  Because of this, we never really get a sense of a climax with Lex and Clark's relationship (nor did we get one in the season 7 finale, which SHOULD have been that climax).  However, the decision to bring closure while still remaining relatively ambiguous (compare Lex's fate in ""Requiem"" to Lana in ""Phantom"") was smart.  Here's to hoping Rosenbaum can return for the series finale to give a real ending to his character.

The other main issue most people have with the season is the finale.  The season seemed to be pushing for a very good ending, and thus most of us went into ""Doomsday"" with very high expectations.  However, because of the success of this season, the series finale had to be re-tooled into a season finale, which I believe to be the major downfall of the episode.  Things couldn't be closed TOO much, and thus character arcs (Davis in particular) took a very weird turn, and we don't really feel fulfilled.  Great things were being set up, but what we got just didn't make sense with what had been established.  I still don't think ""Doomsday"" was as bad as people think it was; the quality was still fantastic, and overall the episode wasn't THAT bad, it's just that the really really awful things (Clark vs. Doomsday, Lois, Jimmy, Davis) seriously overshadowed any good in the episode.  Many elements are debatable, but I'm hoping this is one of the cases where ""Doomsday"" serves better as a spring board into season 9 than as a closing episode.  Even if you go into with low expectations (which you probably should), still be prepared for some real emotional moments--there are plenty.

The first ten episodes of the season are absolutely superb, and the episodes do slip away from the freshness after ""Bride"", but there are still some standout during the second half, specifically the spectacular ""Beast"", the mythology heavy ""Legion"", the lighthearted introduction of Zatanna in ""Hex"", and the fun ""Infamous"" (though be prepared to hold heavy suspension of disbelief for that last one).

The extras, which include a featurettes on Doomsday and Allison Mack's directorial debut, sound intriguing, and I'm really excited for the commentary on ""Legion"" by Geoff Johns.  There is also supposed to be at least one other commentary; I'm hoping we actually get more members of the regular cast on board than we have been in the past three years.

All-in-all, this was a more creatively powered season than the past few, and I really hope season 9 improves on this resurgence.",1245196800,9,6770,4.7342419080068145
3569764,1,B001FB4VZS,"It is sad what Smallville has become. The writing this season has been sub par at best and most of the episodes this season are total crap. Contrivances, retcons, lightswitches, character assassinations, and stupid anvils made the season unbearable.

The only good thing they had going this season was the Davis/Doomsday arc, and in 5 mins during the season finale they manage to ruin that too. These writers are hacks and it is well past that time for the show to end. I will not be buying a dvd of crap.",1245196800,11,505,4.549450549450549

And creatively, the show fails on so many levels.  Clark enters the Daily Planet because... because the script says so.  After 7 years of development, you would have thought more than ""iconic"" would have been used to explore why he choose to leave the farm and work at the Daily Planet.  Chloe Sullivan's arc was there to bring her fans and yet they undermined her character every single episode.  The Doomsday arc finishes completely unsatisfactorily and the lightswitches in the final episode are horrendous. Plot holes, inconsistencies, and major retconning of the last 7 years are in effect. And the use of a fake Lex stunt double is something to you wish you never saw.

Wait for the bargain basement sale if you are a completionist.  If you skipped the season, don't open buy this year on DVD -- it's not pretty.",1245196800,21,1029,4.518918918918919
3569856,1,B001FB4VZS,"Smallville used to be an entertaining show. Even in uneven and, frankly, bad seasons like six and seven, one could find something likable or something that resembled a coherent plot. It was not true in this season. Also, even if one didn't like the particular storyline, they could always enjoy the ""pretty"" - fun effects, nice camera work, well chosen soundtrack and music, amazing casting coups.

Well, gone are the days of guest stars like Carrie Fisher, Christopher Reeve, Mark McClure, Dean Cain, or Helen Slater. Gone are the days of decent special effects or any effect shots at all, frankly. By this point, it feels as if Clark's only superpower is superspeed because the ""woosh"" sound effect is cheap to do. The show is so strapped for cash that it no longer does location shoots and that it also is reduced to synthesized music and very sporadic, if at all, popular music licensing.

It's a shell of what it was.

Granted, a reduced budget isn't everything.

I loved the first season of shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and they clearly had very little to work with. The superficial shouldn't matter, but, on this show, it's all there is to recommend it and even that's gone.

As far as ""plot lines"" for this year?

Let's face it. The producers played chicken with Michael Rosenbaum last season and lost badly. As a result, all of season eight was a mad dash scramble to compensate for the gaping hole the loss of Lex Luthor (as well as Lionel and the Luthor dynamic) had on the show. Now, they did try and introduce Doomsday/Davis Bloome and they did bring in a Mercy-like character in Tess, but it failed miserably. Without a strong villain to work against, the show collapsed on itself and the ""good guys"" became so morally gray that in Justin Hartley's (Oliver Queen's) own words they became ""purple"". But none of this can give you a true idea of how terrible this season was.

So, I shall reveal the plotlines:

-Lana Lang returns for a five episode arc mocked by fans as Lana Begins in which she becomes permanently superstrong and only breaks up with Clark because Lex Luthor (played, I kid you not, by Rosenbaum's stunt double in heavy make up) irradiates her with Kryptonite, leaving her poisonous to Clark

-Tess starts out a loyal minion to Lex but, after Lana's intervention, engages in a long affair with Oliver Queen and turns againt Lex and LuthorCorp. Eventually she degrades into a religious nutjob thinking Clark's an ""alien jesus"" (actual line from a script).

-Chloe Sullivan ends up running a home for the meteor infected and in one hackneyed episode is made to live her cousin's life for a day in which she comes to the sudden conclusion that after wanting to be a reporter since she was eight, she's not so interested anymore.

-Jimmy gets married to Chloe, is trashed by Doomsday at his wedding, then becomes a junkie, dumps Chloe, and in an AMAZING! twist is revealed to be REALLY HENRY OLSEN, the older brother of the real Iconic/Comics Jimmy whom we meet at Henry's funeral in the season finale. So, that Jimmy from that last three years?

Not real, fake out!

-Oliver becomes an alcoholic playboy for half a season, then he turns ""dark"" by murdering Lex, blackmailing Chloe, and using the Justice League to literally shoot Clark in the back with Kryptonite.

-Clark does join the Daily Planet, that's true. In 22 episodes, the only article he publishes is about a kitten show. He gets no real development as a journalist and the Red-Blue Blur arc comprises about 5 episodes of the whole season and is mostly offscreen because they can't afford the effects to show him patrolling. The ep ""Prey"" is almost the extent of it.

-Lois continues to be a disappointment. Her character is gutted so that she can pine for Clark and degrade into passive-aggressive games. Gone is the fighter of seasons 4 and 5. Worse, her journalistic ethics sink to a new low in ""Stiletto"" where she invents a superhero so she can trick the Red-Blue Blur into and interview. The whole ep is played as a joke on the Lois character and is, frankly, best described as a foot fetishist's wet dream.

-Davis Bloome = an excellent arc, well-acted by the brilliant Juliard alum Sam Witwer until the final episode in which he is retconned into a pyschopath and kills Henry, sorry ""Jimmy Olsen,"" and is subsequently stabbed to death by a dying Henry, sorry ""Jimmy Olsen."" The actual Doomsday fight lasts 45 seconds, has a monster out of Power Rangers, and does NOT end with Clark's death.

TOTAL LETDOWN.

I wish, in conclusion, that I could unsee this season and, no, I've not made a single plot detail up.",1245196800,62,4613,4.6810877626699625
3569857,1,B001FB4VZS,"Smallville, as always, is the poster child for squandered potential and absolute trash. Not even the talented Sam Witwer could rescue this season from being the latest in a long line of disappointing seasons. He tried, he, Allison Mack and Tom Welling gave some wonderful work in the episodes that focused on the Clark/Chloe/Davis triangle, but ultimately were powerless against the producers whims and the utter nonsense of the episodes featuring Erica Durance and Aaron Ashmore.

Durance, as usual, is overblown and ridiculous as her character jumps around illogically and without reason from pining for Clark, to his alter ego, the Red Blue Blur. It's got to the point, that I think the writers don't even attempt to give a reason for her character's motivations, and figure the strength of her character's name, Lois Lane, should explain everything about what she does. They forget their audience actually have IQs and are tuning in to be entertained, not treated like dolts. Frankly, this show and this actress have made me LOATHE everything about a character I once admired.

Poor Aaron Ashmore. Saddled with a jerk of a character like Jimmy Olsen over the past few seasons, he tried his best. Sadly, the finale (a truly epic Failsday) solidified his character and this season as arguably the worst in this show's run. His character was the bastard step-child the show liked to forget existed, to the point that fans wished he'd died in Bride. Having Jimmy, excuse me, ""Henry Olsen"" die in FailsDay, the finale, was laughable. I tuned in for the epic showdown bewteen Clark and Doomsday, and got the death of a character that was pretty much worthless to the show.

Ultimately, this season was a waste of time. Don't waste money on a pathetic dvd set when the show's writers and producers aren't bothered on entertaining their audience with coherent storylines and strong characters like Clark, Chloe, Tess and Davis.

Superman and Lois Lane used to be great. Smallville made them the ""heroes"" I'd rather forget existed.",1245196800,23,2026,4.985207100591716
3569858,2,B001FB4VZS,"This season had the potential to be great. It had all the trappings of the great iconic Superman story: The Daily Planet, the Justice League, Doomsday... and yet, they failed to execute it well and also failed in paying off the story they have built, not only this season but in others. Clark vaccilates wildly from being heroic to being jerk, Oliver (the leader of the Justice League) has fallen head-on into corruption, and the vaccuum created by the Luthors was not filled by the new Lex-by-proxy Tess, whose characterization was never firmly nailed down (however, Cassidy Freeman is *fantastic* in the role and has a fan for life in me).

The bright spot in the season is Sam Witwer and his Davis Bloome. He brings new life to the show, and his plotline with Chloe/Allison Mack was one of the best ones the show has ever done. Well, until the end.

The end. Oh, the end. The season finale of this show is the most painful, most disappointing television experience I have ever had (and I watch a lot of TV).

Season Eight is almost unrecognizable as Smallville or as Superman. I give it two stars because episodes like ""Beast,"" ""Legion,"" and ""Abyss"" were somehow outstanding despite the overwhelming suck of this season, and among the best of the series, and because most of the cast continues to deliver good performances, making this badly-written, disappointing failure of a season at least watchable.",1245110400,29,1407,4.7818930041152266
3569859,1,B001FB4VZS,"This was unequivocally the worst season of Smallville yet.  Being Smallville, it had shining moments, like Legion and Beast, but the bad moments far outweigh the good.  Every character gets thrown through the musical-traits machine multiple times throughout the season, and the season finale makes you wish you hadn't wasted your time.

The big Doomsday showdown apparently warranted all of five minutes after an entire season of buildup and you're not even sure whether Supes was there to finish it till they spell it out in the tag.  Oh, and Jimmy Olsen is really his big brother Henry.  Cause brothers always have the same freaking name.  Makes perfect sense, right?

Two words sum up most of the season: Lazy storytelling.",1245110400,23,726,5.0
3569860,1,B001FB4VZS,"Any of the few and far between episodes that could be considered good in Smallville's Season 8 (like ""Legion"" and ""Beast"") were undone and became meaningless with the season finale, ""Doomsday"". Sam Witwer was wonderful as Doomsday/Davis, and it was heartbreaking to see all the nuances he gave the character wasted (complete character assassination), in the last episode. The fight between Clark and Doomsday should have been epic, but instead lasted 5 seconds and was poorly executed. All of the build up leading to that confrontation throughout the season was squandered. In fact, every story-line was squandered.
Also, Eric Durance's Lois Lane has to be the worse version of Lois Lane I've ever seen. This Lois is annoying, abrasive, idiotic, entitled, insipid, and a drag on the Clark Kent character. She has become the new ""Lana"", or Mary Sue, of the show; and it is an insult to Lois Lane fans that the writers of this show depict her in such a badly written way.

If it weren't for Sam Witwer and Allison Mack (who is shamefully barely mentioned in the DVD set/promotion even though she was the female lead and the best actress through out the season), this whole season would have been a wash.

Skip this set, and save yourself the pain.",1245110400,13,1245,4.813084112149533
3569861,4,B001FB4VZS,"Smallville's S8 was bound to be something very different then what came before.  After all, it was losing 2 of its most prominent characters, Lana Lang and Lex Luthor, as well as one of its most intriguing supporting characters, Lionel Luthor.  And bringing on Doomsday as a dual natured, mostly mild mannered paramedic produced a lot of skepticism.  But overall, I think the show made a lot of good progress, particularly in the development of the characters of Clark Kent and Lois Lane.

The first half of this season is probably as strong a series of episodes as any Smallville season has had since S5.  We saw a new, proactive Clark emerge, which included him taking a job at the Daily Planet, right across from future Mrs, Lois Lane.  This new grown-up Clark was a joy to watch, and Tom Welling played the heck out of the more mature Clark (on a shallow note, the change in wardrobe for him is delightful).  Clark adopted a new undercover persona, The Red Blue Blur.  A bit of a lame name, but a huge step into Superman territory.  And after seasons of stalling Clark, how wonderful is that to see?

The budding relationship between Clark and Lois advances by leaps and bounds, with Lois clearly being in love with Clark fairly early on in the season.  I'm not sure if this is a good thing, or a bad one, but Erica Durance sells the role with gusto.  Her evolving feelings for Clark pulled at the heartstrings.

A new addition to the cast, Cassiday Freeman's Tess Mercer makes a fascinating debut.  While the role is a bit underdeveloped, the actress is a gem.

Sam Witwer, as Doomsday alter ego, Davis Bloome, is an impressive actor who pours his heart and soul into the role.  Though Smallville's penchant for woobie, misunderstood villians is getting a bit tiresome at this point, and Witwer's constant tears and angst quickly grew stale.  The character seems to fall apart as the season goes on, and is a complete mess by the last episode, Doomsday.  The worst SV season finale ever.

Two characters that didn't fare so well this season were SV vet, Chloe Sullivan, and new regular, Oliver Queen (aka Green Arrow).  Both of these characters made unfathomable decisions this season, and seem to grow rather dark and unrelatable.  Both commit murder in the course of the season, and the show seems to take a rather odd, neutral position on that action.  Inexplicable on a young Superman show.  Chloe, in particular, seems unrecognizable from the girl we've grown accustomed to, and Allison Mack seems a bit bored.  It feels to me like Chloe is being written more as the ""Lana Lang"" character, rather then being written as her own character.  By the end of the season, neither character felt like people we'd want the future Superman to be close to.

The other regular, Aaron Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen, was badly used for most of the season, with the possible exception of the episode, Identity.  And without spoiling, the characters arc ends in a very unsatisfactory manner.

The biggest problems with this season is the 5 episode Lana Lang arc, which seems to plunge the show into seasons back, and brings to a halt the progress made in the first half of the season.  I'm not sure the show ever recovers from the disruption, and Lana's exit from the show is completely unsatisfying on just about every level.  But particularly if you are a Clark Kent fan.  I simply don't understand what the writers were going for here.  The very worst episode of the arc, Power, is directed by Allison Mack (Chloe Sullivan), and its terrible.

The other major failing of the season is the fact that outside of Welling and Mack, no other character is around for more then 13 episodes.  This makes the season feel very choppy, and disrupts character arcs.  Lois and Jimmy were particularly hard hit by this choice.

Also noticeable is the shows cut rate budget, though to the shows credit, they still manage some spectacular effects, such as Clark's leaping a tall building in Hex, and his jumping from a plane with an unconscious Tess in his arms.  Not enough credit can be given to Welling who sells the super stuff incredibly well.

Overall, I thought S8 got far more right then wrong, and made some great strides in its first half.  But Smallville has been long plagued with a tendency to veer off the rails about mid-season, and unfortunately, even with a change in producers, that trait continues.",1245110400,9,4390,4.696335078534031
3569862,1,B001FB4VZS,"This show used to be dumb but fun. Now it's incoherant and seems completely incapable of choosing what story it wants to tell. Chloe makes dumb choices, Clark is a jerk, there are no Luthors. The season ender to this show was abysmal and I really wish I could unsee it.

No I won't buy the DVD, nor should you buy it as a gift for someone who watches Smallville unless they specifically request this season. Pretty much it ruins any good feelings towards previous seasons by ruining everyone's characterization.

Go buy Chuck instead. That show understands Superman much better than Smallville.",1245110400,28,594,4.813725490196078
3569863,2,B001FB4VZS,"I'm in no way a casual viewer of this show but I'm approaching my review as if the reader has very little experience with Smallville.

If you have never seen the show you might enjoy Season Eight as you have no benchmarks established. I personally thought this season to be one big, huge let down. There were episodes that were flat out painful for me to watch, however, there were some good moments too.

If you are a Tom Welling fan as opposed to a Smallville fan I can strongly recommend this season over all others. Tom's just smokin' hot in Season Eight. Five Stars just on this point (shallow as it is).

If you are a fan of Allison Mack/Chloe Sullivan I would recommend this season with a lot of caution. Chloe experiences a lot of ups and downs. Chloe is the second most important character and like Clark, appears in every episode. She interacts mostly with Clark, Jimmy, and Davis. Do not expect sunshine and rainbows for her. The good is quite good and my purchase is exclusively for those good moments, but I'm not sure an average viewer would glean the same appreciation for those moments as I do. Two and a half stars for Chloe.

If you have been asked by your child to purchase this season and you think it's family safe, I would like to point out some things that might concern you. Although not too graphic, there is premarital sex on this show, even with Clark (no, just because he's suppose to be Superman doesn't mean he's held to a higher standard), the episode ""Instinct"" has some pretty lude sexual references that might be hard to explain to a younger mind, there is drug addiction, and there is a suicide attempt in the episode ""Eternal"". There is much playing around with Christian religious motiff. Those things might be important to you or you could care less. Three stars for family safe.

I am most definitely not a fan of Lois Lane. I would like to point out though that Lois appears in only twelve episodes, so if you're buying believing she's in every one, that's not true. No stars for Lois.

Lana Lang exits Smallville and Clark's life in a five episode arc. I can recommend this arc if you are a Lana fan. If you're not a Lana fan, you're not going to like it. No stars.

If you are a Lex fan, run and hide from this season as Lex makes only one appearance and that actor is not Michael Rosenbaum. If I could give negative stars, it would be for this sloppy tied up loose end. No stars.

To me $38 dollars is a lot of money to spend on something. I personally don't recommend anyone spend that sort of money unless you're 100% sure you'd be satisfied.  Buy with caution is my advice.

I'd give this three stars but the ""Doomsday"" finale forces my hand and I have to give it two.",1244764800,31,2714,4.3777335984095425
3569864,4,B001FB4VZS,"I know that if you've seen Season 7 and haven't seen Season 8 yet that 5 stars can be a little hard to swallow. Stick with me though and I'll do my best to explain why Season 8 is Smallville at it's best. Season 7 was a really weird transition for the show because after Season 6 the show really didn't have anything to offer whatsoever. The actors seemed to be lackluster and the writing had gotten pretty sloppy. Alas, all the Smallville fans out there stuck with it through a very rough patch and Season 8 is the reward.

With a mostly fresh cast and the transition from Smallville to Metropolis, the show was given new life with an endless amount of fun and entertainment. Like I said in my title, the show really doesn't even feel like the previous seasons of Smallville. It really is Superman, or the Red-Blue Blur as he becomes known in Season 8, without any flying or tights. It's really a ton of fun and the introduction of the villain Doomsday was a brilliant move by the writers. Sam Witwer is really great as Davis, Doomsday's human side. Because of Doomsday the Season does seem a bit darker compared to all the others. It is a nice change though and it's what the show needed. Tom Welling is really great this season also and it's amazing how much more enthusiastic he seems compared to last season.

There are really some standout episodes this Season. My personal favorites include Infamous, Doomsday, Bride, Legion, Beast, and Hex. The rest of the episodes, aside from Power and Requiem which are pretty terrible, are just as good as anything the other seasons have offered.

Most importantly of all, Season 8 is just a blast to watch. It's hard to believe that the show could be so good without Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover. Believe it though. Or just pick up Season 8 and find out for yourself.",1244592000,8,1818,4.519756838905775

If the writing team can't hold the standard/quality, then the show needs to end. Yet, why worry about a little thing like quality, when money is on the other end. Anyways, the 8th season rambled all over the place, and not one episode was great. There were a couple that were good, but that is myself being polite.

But my favorite episode in the whole season was Infamous because we got the chance to see the future of Clark's superhero identity and learnt the reaction of Lois to Clark's famous SECRET.Although the ending was a little bit sad ,the episode was great.

As a former review said, this season was more of the running in the same place.  Like being on a treadmill, but not going anywhere. Sure they introduced 'doomsday' and the future legion, but one of the things that make Superman what it is is the fantasy.  By trying to make it in the real world of regular people and life, it takes away what it should be. The 'doomsday' thingee was just aweful all season; stringing it along with no climatic finale. Chloe needs to go; Lana needs to go; Lois needs to tone down the attitdue(it's annoying to sound that confident).  Suit up and be done with it.  Maybe every 3rd or 4th episode even. It doesn't need to be for 5 minutes in each episode even.

The new woman who took over for lex was stupid(the character). I never really liked lex anyway; so he's a smart guy who manipulates people and things.  Superman needs to go off into space and fight Mogul(the real comic book guy, not some stupid Smallville facsimile like 'doomsday') and tear some stuff up. I finally got too fed up with the whole destiny thing of Clark.  How long has it been that they don't want to move the character into what he is: Superman.  They don't even want to say the name, they toyed around it in that one episode. Utterlly frustrating.  Tom welling could have been in Transformes: Revenge of the Fallen, but he's stuck on this groundhog day of a show not going anywhere. I guess it's a steady job with good money, but please move on, he can do better. Since The Unit is cancelled, now all I'll have next season is 24 on Fox, Flashpoint on CBS, and Soutland on NBC.

However, he deserves to be not only the small screens Clark Kent but also the big screens ""Superman"". For some reason Warner Brothers can't seem to see that Tom Welling can say more with his facial expressions than most actors say with their whole acting abilities. You actually feel his surprise, joy, pain and loneliness by just looking into his eyes.

  This series is wonderful. They have played with the DC comic line but mostly in good ways. If they would have been completely in line with the comics, Lana would marry Pete Ross. Clark's parents would have been much older. Clark would be flying instead of running at super-speed. He would have telescopic vision. The Fortress of Solitude would be in the side of an ice-berg and he would have to open the door with a giant golden key. The Martian Man-Hunter would be green. There would be many more differences. I admit that the majority of changes are done well.

  Season eight is a good season with some story changing additions, especially with the two who die at the end of the season. Neither follow the comic book, at least in the way one died and the fact that the other died at all. I enjoyed this season as I have every season and I will buy this season on Blu-Ray to add to my collection. I only wish that the CW Network would broadcast their shows in HD in our area. The only way we can watch it in High Def is to buy the Blu-Ray DVD or wait for it to come to HD Net.

  If you like the Superman Story then buy this season. I am sure you will enjoy it. I'm afraid that with CW moving Smallville to Friday night this coming season that it will be the ""KISS OF DEATH"" to the series. It will be sad to see the show end and it will be sadly missed once it is gone. Thanks to all the great actors of SMALLVILLE and keep up the good work as long as they keep you on the air.  Lt. Robert T. Jeffcoat, Sr.",1243468800,7,1984,4.170157068062827
3570025,4,B001FB4VZS,"This was a well made episode, but I still think Clark is way too serious these days.  Even in a serious episode like this one, they should have a few light hearted moments in my opinion.  And I hope the 9th season brings on the cape and some flight scenes.  I'm looking forward to it.  Smallville Rules!",1243382400,,303,4.2631578947368425
3570026,4,B001FB4VZS,"***MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD***

I thought that this season of SMALLVILLE was one of its best, despite the absence of Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, who I think, besides Allison Mack and Tom Welling, was a major highlight performer on this show. But they brought in Cassidy Freeman as Tess Mercer, the new boss of Luthorcorp, Sam Witwer as doe-eyed EMT Davis Bloome who unfortunately shares his body with the Kryptonian force of destruction known as Doomsday, and giving Justin Hartley regular screen-time as Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow.

While having some great action and acting moments, the series sometimes suffers from the contrived deus ex machina of the conveniently unconscious friend/colleague/love interest whenever Clark needs to use his powers but keep his identity safe. But the worst one of all comes from one of the season's strongest episodes when members of the 31st century's Legion of Superheroes come to Smallville to help Clark out of a jam. They leave with him a Legion ring that will allow him to come forward in time to their century.

In the season finale, ***SPOILER*** Lois grabs the ring and is whisked forth in time, and subsequently Jimmy Olsen is fatally wounded by Davis.

Hmm... do you think that the show will break continuity with the Superman mythology, or is Lois somehow going to come back and be able to fix this major character's death?

I guess we'll have to wait for Season Nine!",1243209600,6,1419,4.895833333333333
3570027,5,B001FB4VZS,"This is my opinion, has been one of the best seasons of Smallville. Season 7 was good, but Clark was facing the same problems over and over and over. It was getting so old. This season is a breath of fresh air. So if you had given up on smallville a few years ago, you should definatly watch this season, because it is amazing!",1243036800,12,327,4.125
3570028,2,B001FB4VZS,"I have to agree with ""K-Dawg"" on this one... this season was no where near as good as Season 7.  Frankly, I'm amazed at all the positive reviews.  I'm not commenting on the quality of the Blu-Ray presentation, just the season as a whole.  The ""Tess Mercer"" character is easy on the eyes but lacks history with the existing players to make her ""Lex Luthor"" like behavior believable. The fact that she strolls into the Kent Home and barn with impunity, or that she always seems to be in the strangest places at the right time (alleyways, cornfields,etc..) is nothing short of maddening, as is her insistence that Clark ""trust her"" or ""come to her when the time is right""... why the hell would he do that, she's a stranger?!?
Parts of the storyline seemed glossed over; When exactly did Oliver succeed in killing Lex Luthor?  The Season finale was the most senseless episode of all:
1. Why did Chloe stop Clark from banishing Davis?
2. Why did Tess assume Lois stole the Orb?
3. Why would Clark leave the Leigon's ring in his unlocked desk at work?
I love this show but it's time to wrap it up.  It's becoming as senseless as ""Heroes"". It's time for Tom to put on the Superman outfit... He's earned the right to wear it and we loyal viewers have earned the right to see him in it.",1242864000,3,1277,4.417021276595745

3570031,2,B001FB4VZS,"As most fans who watch this show are aware, the character Doomsday emerged this season.  However if your a fan of the comics, you will most likely wind up scratching your head as to why the writers are bringing in a character that is known the world over for killing Superman.  Especially considering this a show that has nothing to do with Superman, but an adolescent Clark.

As usual, Doomsday's origins get the standard Smallville treatment in that it deviates far from the source material.  The writers decided that Doomsday would reside within a human host (that ""host"" being Davis Bloome).  Now as much as I would love to say that there was major character development within this season, I'm sorry to say that I am at a loss for words.  Aside from a stellar performance from Allison Mack (Chloe), the drivel that is written up about Doomsday/Davis is hokey at best.

As stated earlier, Alison Mack delivers a roller coaster of emotions through her character.  Chloe, by far, has her worst season yet.  Her character encounters so much tragedy, that I'm amazed that Alison Mack was able to deliver so flawlessly.  All this tragedy stems from Chloe's interactions with Davis. The two share quite a bit of screen time together.  Not in a romantic way mind you, but more in a hostage kind of way.

We also see the emergence of Tess Mercer, the temporary replacement for Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum left the show last season).  Now she may not be as evil as Lex, but she certainly is just as shady.  With season nine possbily being Smallville's last, it's obvious that there is little time or incentive to develop this character beyond a season or two.  Which is why Tess's actions will continue to speak louder than words.  So don't be surprised if this character exits just as quickly as she appeared.

The writers also finally tie up the loose ends left over from Clark and Lana's relationship.  We finally find out why Lana taped the ""dear john"" video for Clark from last season, although I think this explanation arrives a season too late.  However it's through the result of that explanation, that the writers finally seal the end of the relationship.  Sadly, the writers put Lana in such an over the top predicament, that it comes off as just ridiculous (trust me when I say ""you have to see it to believe it"").  I would have preferred a coming to terms ending between these two characters that would have resulted in a powerful and emotional pivotal scene, in place of the debacle the writers came up with.

Which leads us right back to Doomsday (which this season was centered around anyway).

Throughout the season we saw much bickering between Oliver and Clark over how to go about ridding the world of Doomsday.  Do you kill Davis, thereby making the fight significantly easier, or take the moral high ground and try to save Davis?  It's not too difficult to figure out which option Clark chose.

Now as you would imagine, there is a final showdown between Clark and Doomsday.  Unfortunately, it was weak at best.  The writers teased the audience for nine straight months, only to have this final fight last less than sixty seconds.  This was a major disappointment in my book.  You don't bring in the one and only character ever known to kill Superman, and have Clark not only win the fight, but have the battle run as short as it did.

There is also a major twist in the season finale involving Jimmy, Chloe, and Davis.  The twist mostly involves Davis, but makes no sense based on the characteristic traits we have seen with this character thus far.  It's obvious that the writers were pushing for a surprise twist, but all season they kept leading their audience down a narrow path that resulted in the wool being removed from everyone's eyes in the eleventh hour.  The problem with this is that there were no visible signs that would have left the audience questioning their assumptions.  *SPOILER ALERT* -As if the Davis twist wasn't shocking enough, we learn that Jimmy wasn't really the James Olsen from the comic book.  Apparently he was Henry Olsen, Jimmy's older brother. Which begs the question, ""Was it really necessary to call him Jimmy?"".  And given how old the cast now is and looks, I was surprised when they revealed the real Jimmy Olsen to be no older than twelve years of age (I'm totally guessing, but he was a kid regardless).  I find it perplexing, yet also humorous that the writers go to great lengths to avoid the actor's ages. For example, Tom Welling (Clark) is 32 years of age, yet in the realm of Smallville we're supposed to believe he's only 21.  Look, Tom has aged well, but not that well.

At the tail end of the season finale, we also saw the reemergence of Zod (again). It's safe to say that the well of ideas has run dry for Smallville. When you have an underpowered Clark defeating the likes of Lex Luthor, Bizzaro, Brainiac, Lord Zod, and Doomsday, it leaves little reason for Clark to become Superman. And since Clark has managed to go toe to toe with some of Superman's greatest villains, it wouldn't make sense to bring in a villain of lesser renown into the realm of Smallville for next season. Hence the reason why we have seen Brainiac on more than one occasion.

This show is so far gone that I no longer hold that emotional attachment I once had. I thought the emergence of Doomsday was a bad idea, and my gut was right.  I can't speak for everyone, but I could care less about what the next season will bring.",1242604800,30,5473,4.6115702479338845
3570032,5,B001FB4VZS,"I did not miss an episode this Season and I could not have been happier...my favorite things were Lois and Clark getting more time together *Especially those calls she got from the ""Red-Blue Blur""*...Jimmy's turn on Chloe, no matter how much it upset her..*I'm bizarre and thought it was funny* And Doomsday..oh Doomsday..the best character in Smallville history, at least to me :) I recommend this Season to any Smallville fan, you won't be disappointed, every episode either makes you laugh, cry, or scream..the finale was not to much of a let down for me, I liked it..I think it was good acting on all sides and the writers just blew me away..my only hope, is for a Doomsday action figure",1242604800,5,691,4.7190082644628095
3570033,3,B001FB4VZS,"okay guys my yearly review of Smallville.  THis season had some major strong points this, most notably Sam Witwer as Davis Bloome, and Erica Durance as Lois Lane.  But other than that it was an ehhhh season

Season 8

1. Odyessy:  Strong opener, but could have given us a whole lot more.
2. Plastique.  SO so so lame
3. Toxic: Great episode, we learned how Oliver became the Green Arrow
4. Insticnt:  Avg. episode.
5. Committed: Another avg. episode
6. Prey:  So so so lame
7. Identity: Great episode, Jimmy Olsen does he learn the true identity of Clark??
8. Bloodline:  Perhaps the best episode of the season: Clark and Lois end up in the Phantom Zone.
9. Abyss:  Good episode: Has Chole forgotten everyone in her life except for Davis?
10. Bride: Great episode. Do Chloe and Jimmy have a happy wedding. Is that Lex?
11. Legion:  Ehhh episode, Some good parts and some bad parts
12. 13. 14.  The worst episodes EVER! Dont even deserve a description
15. Infamous: Great episode, Has the world found out Clarks secret
16.  Turbulence: Avg. Episdoe: Has Tess figured out Clarks secret?
17.  Hex: Good episode, A magician Grants Choles wish
18.  Eternal:  Good episode, but kind of changes the Superman background
19.  Stileto:  People either loved or hated this episode. I was not a fan
20.  Beast: Avg episode.  Could have given us so much more
21.  Injustice:  Okay episode. Is Tess good or evil?
22.  Doomsday: I say it is avg.  Very disappointing in parts.  Kind didn't give us much for a finale.  The fight with Clark and Doomsday.  Lasted 1 minute.

So to sum it up.  Tough year.  Dont forget about those 3 episodes that I didn't even give credit to.

Tell me your thoughts?? Do you agree? Disagree?

I will still buy the season, but will be skimming through a lot of it",1242345600,8,1775,4.536507936507936
3570034,4,B001FB4VZS,"It seemed that the show's writers had two main objectives this season: 1)Fire up the chemistry between Erica Durance and Tom Welling full blast and 2)Create and carry out a plausible introduction of Doomsday to Smallville. They accomplished both - a remarkable feat given that the ""genius"" in charge of actor contracts hired Erica Durance for a mere 12 shows out of 22! But this is a testament to Durance's talent and presence - she owns most of her scenes. Then on the Doomsday arc - it was clever the way they used the Pilot footage to integrate the Davis Bloom/ Doomsday character. I do think they went nauseatingly overboard with the use of Chloe in the Doomsday arc but thankfully, there was a payoff: (Fingers crossed) This season may mark the end of the uber-annoying hold Chloe had on Clark. I swear sometimes it seemed like Clark was Chloe's pet doggy and she scolded him whenever he displeased her and patted him when he obeyed her -oh, these lazy and cheap writers/producers - they consistently use the chloe character as a shortcut in plot points instead of using the more interesting but expensive comic book routes. Here's hoping this changes next season. One of my all out favorite exchanges from the finale is when Chloe tells Clark (paraphrased), ""It's the human emotions that have made you the hero that you are."" And Clark responds, ""It's those emotions that keep me from being the hero I could be."" Oh, snap! Hopefully, this really is the end of Smallville's watered down, couch-sitting, Hamlet-like version of Clark Kent and the producers will stay true to their word and move the show in line with the comics - which I hope includes getting rid of Chloe. Fine, don't kill her off but, please, get rid of her!! One character I was not sorry to see go was the queen-of-all-things-obnoxious, lana lang. I was heartbroken to see her back this season in five episodes. I took off one star for this terrible imposition the show runners forced on us. And, I totally agree with a previous reviewer in that her story arc was not only ridiculous, but laugh-out-loud insanely moronic! I, too, almost stopped watching the show because of this particular plot point. Seriously, Jimmy Olsen makes a more believable superhero than lang. Here's to this really and truly being the end of her! Speaking of Jimmy Olsen, I was briefly upset at the writers killing him off but, it was ... callously inventive how they introduced his little brother to be the ""real"" Jimmy Olsen who will become Superman's Pal and Lois Lane's sidekick. Aaron Ashmore has an endearing quality to him but he was too assertive to be the traditional young Olsen from the comics. I sincerely wish him all the best in all he is to do. I'm going to miss seeing him on the show. The scene he had with Lois in the finale was quintessential Lois and Jimmy. They really seemed to enjoy each other. Another thing I appreciated was how the writers used more of Superman's Judeo-Christian origin. Although, the analogies were sometimes much too blatant and extremely misused. For example, peterson comparing chloe to Mary Magdalegne - PLEASE, if the real Mary had been like her, the entire world would have been seriously screwed for all time!!

All in all, I do say it is the best season of Smallville thus far due to the fact that Lois and Clark got good development in eleven of the twelve Lois Lane episodes. These particular moments are so good that I may actually buy this dvd set at the introductory price instead of waiting for the Christmas $15 sale. It seems that in the end, the multiple personality prone show runners thought this too - the DVD cover with Lois and Clark at the Daily Planet promotes the best this season had to offer and is my absolute favorite to date.
UPDATE 8/27/09
DVD Features:
1. All 22 episodes in anamorphic widescreen on 6 discs - much better than the pan and scan full screen version shown on air.
2. Two featurettes: In the Director's Chair w/ Mack and Doomsday-Making of a Monster - they couldn't have picked two more boring subjects
3. Two very interesting commentaries on two episodes -""Identity"" (producer, director and Cassidy Freeman) and ""Legion"" (producers and writer).

Episode List:
1. Oddyssey: GRADE A-
2. Plastique: B+ (deleted scene)
3. Toxic: B-
4. Instinct: B ...(deleted scenes) Focuses on Jimmy more than usual which he totally pulls off being the object of a super woman's affections and there's a really cool fight scene between her and Lois.
5. Committed: A ...The look on Clark's face when Lois admits to loving him is priceless and the last scene in the elevator is fantastic.
6. Prey: B-
7. Identity: A- ...(commentary)
8. Bloodline: A-
9. Abyss: C-
10. Bride: B ...In my opinion, the real ""Bride"" at the heart of the episode is Lois destined to belong to Superman despite the very unwelcome intrusion of the lang character. Honestly, they should have spared us.
11. Legion: B- ...(wierd deleted scene and interesting commentary by comics writer Geoff Johns - he states his regrets about not getting to write for Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen in this episode) The best non-Erica Durance episode of the season but not as solid as it could have been. Again, I agree with the previous reviewer when he said that lana lang almost managed to ruin it by showing her face.
12. Bulletproof: D ...Why was chloe still in Smallville when her new husband, Henry James Olsen was in Star City recovering from near fatal wounds inflicted on him by his new wife's would-be lover, Doomsday? Lois was the one taking care of Jimmy just so her dear, sweet, considerate cousin can stick around all her helpless friends who just can't live without her incessant, ignorant, incompetent and often murderous meddling.
13. Power: FAIL ...(deleted scenes) The butchering of Clark Kent's character and the ARC OF SUCK of lana lang in full swing courtesy of showrunners kelly souders and brian peterson, writers todd slavkin and darren swimmer and first time director alison mack. Either they were even more delusional than the lana and chloe fans or all their brains were buried in a crap infested toilet when they conceived this - it holds the shameful distinction along with Season 4's ""Ageless"" (another lang-worshiping episode as conceived by devoted worshipers al gough and miles millar though steven deknight took the blame) as the WORST EPISODE OF THE ENTIRE SERIES.
14. Requiem: D- ...(deleted scenes) The only thing that saved it from being on par in idiocy with ""Power"" is that lana ""the girl next door turned Lex Luthor free-loader turned embittered, vengeful hypocrite turned Bizarro's skank turned insane thief turned giant turn off for Clark"" lang finally left the building. The exit from Clark's life that should have stuck happend in Season 5's ""Void."" It was an extremely moving scene played to perfection by Kreuk. I actually felt for Lana and hoped the writers would empower her from then on instead, the very next episode, they had her clinging to Lex and would repeat this sickening topsy turvey for THREE FULL YEARS until this sorry excuse for a story unceremoniously pulled the plug.
15. Infamous: B+ ...Very, very special moments here. Unfortunately, this is where they decided to turn Davis Bloom into the Incredible Hulk without the heroics.
16. Turbulence: C+ ...(deleted scene) And this is where they revealed Tess to be a total mess of a woman and where they did a 180 with (Henry) Jimmy Olsen.
17. Hex: A ...(most interesting deleted scenes - there are several) The whole silly chloe-is-Lois obsessively DELUSIONAL fan theory is laid to rest. You'd think that 7 and 1/2 years would be long enough to hold on to their delusion but these very immature people just couldn't stomache accepting the fact that the icons Clark Kent and Lois Lane were NEVER created to have feeble phlegmatic temperaments.
18. Eternal: C- ...(deleted scene)
19. Stiletto: A ...The best episode of the season by far. We get Lois in a Catwoman/Huntress costume with Batman references galore and the real beginning of the legendary romance between Lois and Superman. They even used three notes of the John Williams penned theme song for Lois in the last scene. Very cool episode.
20. Beast: D- ...(deleted scenes)
21. Injustice: D- ...(deleted scenes) Tom Welling at his directorial worst, I'm sorry to say. This episode was TOTALLY POINTLESS. After viewing it the first time, it gave the impression that: 1)Oliver deeply cared for Tess, but then just a few episodes into the following season, he completely turned on her. 2)Tess is presented as a master manipulator, meticulously deliberate in every move she makes- following episode and for the entirety of season nine, she's shown to be completely clueless and bases all her decisions on pure emotion. 3)Chloe is played as a an uber-sweet, vulnerable, self-sacrificing victim of her own heroics... very next week, she's forever branded as the high priestess of delusional, narcissistic, egotistical, incompetent, murderously ignorant morons everywhere. 4)Clark seemed to actually have a solid grasp on who he is and what his purpose is then the very next episode, he declares himself to be more lost than ever - see what happens when you rely on little chloe to be your ""brain"" and ""best friend"" for eight freakingly loong years.
22. Doomsday: D ...It was not as bad as I expected it to be and has actually got me excited for the next season or two. I'll bet that Lois and eventually Lex will turn up with some form of amnesia.

The following is directed at those who are unfamiliar with this series but are considering buying this set: If you've read through most of the reviews, you've noticed that Superman fans are split into roughly four categories:

1. The Comic Book Fan Boys (mostly boys): These are intimately familiar with Superman lore and so are simultaneously horrified and fascinated by this show. They are very vocal in complaining about the changes in the traditional Superman story but continue watching this show because they love the episodes that directly foreshadow the future assured incarnation of an unleashed Superman.

2. The Generation Z Phlegmatics: These fans are the current young generation that were born between 1986-1995. Mostly, they know little if anything about Superman before ""Smallville."" So, actually, they are NOT Superman fans at all but merely ""Smallville"" fans with a penchant for the teen-age melodramatic, girly, idiotic, tragicly nonsensical romance stories the CW loves to serve them up. To them, Lana Lang is the love of Clark Kent's life and she should have never left the series. Or, if Lana had to leave then Chloe Sullivan should be Clark's bride. These have a special attachment to the manufactured Chloe character because she is one of them. Perhaps this is precisely why the show creators decided to invent this character - to speak directly to those who were teenagers and preteens when this show began. But wether they love Clana or Chlark, these fans have one thing that unites them: They all hate Lois Lane. They hate her because her character is nothing like them. They don't understand how this version of Clark Kent (whom the creators made out to be a phlegmatic-like character, at least for the first 3 seasons) can possibly fall in love with a woman like Lois - assertive, self-sufficient, irreverent and beautifully sexy with little insecurity - EXACTLY the type of woman the real Superman/Clark Kent (with his melancholic/choleric temperament) would fall hard for. The critical reviews with a 1-3 star rating are given by fans that fall into this or the previous category.

3. The Superfriend Fan: This is what I call those that are not comic book fans per se but grew up watching or became interested in the animated versions of Superfriends and Justice League. They mostly just like DC comic book superheros and are not familiar or like very much the Marvel characters or any other comic book company inventions. These fans mostly ignored this show until about season 4, 5 or 6 when Smallville started looking more like its predecessors. They take this show for what it is - a new incarnation of a favorite fictional character. As long as the major points are hit, they don't mind this version too much (unless it's something as horrendous as the superlana arc!!!).

4. Everyone Else: This is you. You've heard of Superman (how could you not?) and your parents or grandparents or great-grandparents grew up reading Superman Comic Books. When comic books were first invented in the 1930's until about the first half of the 1960's (what's considered the ""Golden Age"" of entertainment - before the dawn of the hippies and feminists and method actor take-over), reading comics was as common as reading the newspaper and were sold at all news stands for about the same price as a newspaper. Now, comic books are only sold on the internet or in specialty stores run by die-hard fans that scare off the general public for ridiculously high prices. Anyway, if you're reading this, it's probably because you like the Superman character and have become curious about this long-running show that is about the man-who-would-be. My advice: If you can easily afford it, go ahead and buy this set at the current $30-something price. You will be entertained and you'll love the classic 1940's style and feel to the sets and costumes - especially where Clark Kent and Lois Lane are concerned. If you're still unsure, wait for this to go on sale (it always does - usually within a year of release) for under $20. You won't regret this purchase. Ignore the negative reviews - as previously noted, they were made by disgruntled fans and not a true reflection of the high production quality of this show. Even if you don't much care for Superman, you will be wowed by the sizzling, sparkling, combustible chemistry between Erica Durance and Tom Welling.",1242345600,12,13857,4.849239864864865
3570105,4,B001FB4VZS,"The end of this season? oR Series? I am unfortunate. I can't get the CW.  I live on the big island of Hawaii...I LOVE my home but the cable companies suck big time here,
Anyway  to the review:
Great show acting, plot...but just like other earlier seasons, at the ending there was little clue as to what is going on... Which makes you wonder if they got cut/sacked/cancelled  Or what? I can not think of a series that ended at season 8. the general rule is 5, 7, 10...esspecially with a show this popular.  I wish UNBOX would give it's customer base a link to each show's ""site"" so no matter what show you buy, no matter what season it is... the consumer (me) can find out what's what with the show.  Did it occur to any of you at Amazon that many of us unboxers buy what we buy because we are unable to get it on our cable network... in other words, we know it's there but you are our only acess. please provide links to each shows home page.",1242259200,,942,4.153846153846154
3570106,4,B001FB4VZS,"In what I thought was the last season of Smallville actually wasn't and it's coming back for a 9th season next year. Michael Rosenbaum was a solid Lex Luther but I don't blame him for not returning for this season. I mean in his last years all they could think of doing with him was put him with Lana and have him look for a secret group that worshiped Clark. It's too bad that Kristin Kreuk had to make a 4 episode appearance though. I would have much rather have seen Rosenbaum back. The writers have always thought of bad new ways to overuse her character. A 4 episode appearance was a lot more painful than I was hoping for. Hell what was done with her almost made me want to stop watching the show. I'll just say they totally overdid it this time. If you think she has been used bad in the past, no way does it compare to how she was used in just 4 episodes!

  While when Lana was gone Chloe managed to get on my nerves this season instead. Sam Witwer plays David Bloome who right away has a huge crush on Chloe. It's silly how she is drawn to him too and how she takes his part over Jimmy and Clark who she has known a lot longer. Oh, plus David Bloome the pretty boy just happens to be Doomsday. That's right, the Doomsday in the comics that killed Superman. Only in Smallville would Doomsday be a pretty boy that has a crush on Chloe lol.

  So yeah what was done with Lana was beyond horrible and the Chloe and Doomsday stuff was a bit annoying too. Yet, the season did have plenty of good moments as well. Erica Durance is no doubt 100% Lois Lane this season. She has really become the character and the way Clark and Lois flirt and tease each other was just a delight to watch. Which made it a shame that she was totally pushed to the side and barely even mentioned in 3 of the episodes that Lana was in. Her scenes with Clark beats Clark all depressed saying ""oh Lana this, oh Lana that"" any day. Lois and Clark are fun together, Lana and Clark haven't been fun together since god knows when. They are just depressing and boring and I sure the hell hope she's not back in season 9, even if it is a small appearance.

  Lana even managed to almost ruin a near solid episode where Legion, a team of heroes come from the future to help Clark. Brainiac has taken over Chloe and they want to kill her and Clark doesn't. It was an awesome episode, that was until the girl in Legion tells Lana that she has a great destiny and Lana has a huge smile on her face like she knows she's all that. It was just painful to watch. Supergirl took a hike just so Lana could be told she has a great destiny ? What the hell ? lol.

  I should mention that Lex makes a very small appearance without Rosenbuam playing the part. But a sexy red head named Tess Mercer  (Cassidy Freeman) takes over the Luther mansion and the Daily Planet. She wants to find Lex and also find out everything there is to know about Clark. She also has a history with Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) since he once saved her life. I liked the addition of her but I do think the show does need Lex back in the last season. It just isn't the last season without him. Especially since he has been better as a villain than any other comic book villain that has made an appearance. Clark's big battles with them never turn out to be much, hell I guess you could hardly even call them big battles. When ever he actually had the guts to stand up to Lex and tell him off, I even found that more satisfying.",1242259200,6,3464,4.159940209267564
3570107,5,B001FB4VZS,"Except for a major stutter in mid-season, Season 8 of SMALLVILLE has been the best in several years.  The major problem with the show had long been the continuing gap between it and the traditional Superman mythology.  It was OK for this to happen for a while it was dealing with Clark's high school days, but after awhile they simply needed to get on with the story.  We've always known how it was going to end.  Or at least where a number of things would inevitably end up.  Lana would go away and Lois would take her place.  Clark would learn to fly.  He would become a superhero and embrace his destiny.  But for several years, while the show remained enjoyable, it felt more like the show was running in place than telling a story.  Season 8 went a long way to correcting this.  For instance, things really started heating up between Clark and Lois, and they turned out to far more chemistry than we had been given reason in previous seasons to hope.  In fact, I enjoyed few things in Season 8 as much as the scenes between the two of them.  And increasingly the show was brought in line with DC mythology.  In fact, the current producers have promised that the 9th season will move even closer to Superman.  And all I can say is, it's about time.

As if to prove all this, the one real glitch in Season 8 came with the return of Lana in midseason.  The series had been moving along marvelously, with one delightful twist after another, all to come to a crashing halt when Lana came back to SMALLVILLE.  Mind you, I like Kristin Kreuk and think she is one of the cutest women in the world, but the whole Clark and Lana story got old a very long time ago and it was time to move on, not time to prolong it a bit longer.  Lana's goodbye in Season 7 should have been for good.  Worst of all, when Lana came back, Lois went away.  One of the most regrettable tings about Season 8 is that Erica Durance, despite being an opening credits character, was in fact only a halftime cast member.  I didn't count precisely, but my guess is that she was actually only in about half of the season's episodes.  For the show to move forward in Season 9, that needs to change.  They need to pull out their pocketbooks and pay Erica Durance for twenty-two episodes.  Hopefully they have realized this on their own.

Season 8 saw a number of other DC additions.  We got additional tastes of the JLA in embryo.  We got Clark fully embracing a dual identity, as Clark on the one hand the Red-Blue Streak on the other, even wearing something of a uniform in the combo of his red or blue T-shirt and blue or red windbreaker.  He works at the Daily Planet as a reporter, sitting right beside Lois.  And he confronts during the course of the season one of the greatest Superman nemeses, Doomsday, who bears the distinction of having killed Superman in the comics.  Sharing the body of Davis Bloome, Doomsday remains somewhat under control, but when he becomes pure beast in the finale, he is pretty fearsome indeed.  For so long the show seems afraid to embrace the fact that this whole thing was about the Boy Who Becomes Superman.  Now that it is finally coming to terms with that, it has gotten better.

I'm more excited about SMALLVILLE moving into Season 9 than I have in a long, long time.  With things between Lois and Clark becoming what it was supposed to be, with the show moving closer to the DC mythology (with one staggering exception, the death - or at least the apparent death - of a Superman universe staple), and with the new producers seemingly unafraid to move the story to new places, the show at this late date seems to be revitalized and full of purpose once again.  Even though Season Eight did not end on the kind of huge cliffhanger it has in the previous seven ones, but a sad, somber one, most things will inevitably go back to normal, or SMALLVILLE's version of normal, early in Season 9.",1242259200,5,3895,4.4

3570109,2,B001FB4VZS,"Granted I know this is another version of Superman but the route that the writers are going it is completely messing with the mythos! Lois has seen Clark without glasses, he's working with her now at the DP without glasses, how dumb would Lois have to be to not recognize that Clark Kent is Superman when he puts on the tights and cape! While Lois and Clark make for some funny moments, the romance chemistry just isn't there! Personally I feel like the whole thing is being rushed.

When it comes to the Doomsday/Davis/Clark plot, I was left thinking ""What are the writers doing?! grasping at straws for something to watch every week?"" The Clark and Lana arc was ""resolved"" I guess you could say thanks to Lex, who returned as knock-off Darth Vader, who sadly was not even Michael Rosenbaum himself! and yet at the same time somehow the Clark and Lana arc wasn't ""resolved"". For Clark to be completely obsessed and madly in love with Lana and have them ripped apart like they were and then turn around and have Clark and Lois just seems unrealistic, Satisfying to some Superman fans yes, but completely unrealistic if we're going with the usual Smallville plot route.

Some episodes had the tendency to drag or were just boring, I found myself switching to ""Ugly Betty"" at times. Even the actors seemed bored in their performances majority of the time. Over half the original cast is gone, only two remain, even the creators of the show left this season, you would think that would be a clue to end the show and yet they pressed on producing one of the most boring seasons yet. *sorry*

I give it two stars just for the two original cast members (Tom Welling and Allison Mack) who seem to be holding on strong and for the very sad and brief return of Kristin Kreuk as Lana Lang.",1242259200,13,1779,4.535825545171339
3570110,4,B001FB4VZS,"Season 8 of ""Smallville"" had a lot of things going against it when it premiered in the fall of 2008. It had lost some major cast members. Michael Rosenbaum(Lex Luthor), and Kristin Kreuk(Lana Lang), did not return as cast members. If that weren't a big enough bomb being dropped on the show, the series' creators and runners, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, also left the show after the seventh season. Everybody was jumping ship, and I, as well as many other fans and critics, worried and wondering how the show would be without these major factors. How will it go on?. How will it work?. Will it be any good?. Throw in the news that two new characters would be added to the mix, and Justin Hartley would be upgraded as a regular cast member as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, and you had a new season that had many fans curious...and worried.

Season 8(and I will be as spoiler free as I can)continues Clark Kent's path to becoming Superman, and we are getting closer and closer. He now works at The Daily Planet with Lois Lane(Erica Durance) and Jimmy Olsen(Aaron Ashmore), who is taking the next step in his relationship with Chloe(Allison Mack). Lex Luthor has mysteriously vanished, and in his place comes Tess Mercer(Cassidy Freeman)to run things. If Tess knows Lex and is running his business and living in his mansion, can she be trusted?. Elsewhere, we are also introduced to paramedic Davis Bloome(Sam Witwer), who is holding a deep, dark secret of his own.

Okay, so after the fears and worries about season 8, how is it?. I am happy to say that fans' worries should be put to rest. Season 8 starts off a little rocky, a little unsure, but after a few episodes it really grabs hold of it's new storylines, characters, and just goes to town with it. The good news is that not only does it work, it works like gangbusters. The inclusion of villain Doomsday to the show was a great idea. The monster and his identity has been a fantastic surprise, and the monster himself is so cool and has a strong, powerful presence of evil that hasn't really quite been seen on the show. Chloe suddenly gets involved, and it goes to another level. There are a number of things going on, and it all gels. Al and Miles shouldn't worry. Their baby is in good hands. The Doomsday/Chloe/Clark thing is one of the best story arcs the show has had. I loved the last 2 seasons, but this storyline trumps those. There is a level of real danger this year, and it has sent the show some surprising shocks and surprises, not to mention pushing characters in new and surprising directions. Elsewhere, the show plays with the relationship between Clark and Lois. This also works really well. Tom Welling and Erica Durance have unbelieveable chemistry, and the sparks just fly whenever they are together. What ultimately happens between them remains to be seen, but I look forward to finding out. And for you Lana fans, yes, she does appear. Kristin Kreuk appears in five episodes, beginning with ""Bride"", and continues in ""Legion"", ""Bulletproof"", ""Power"", and ""Requiem"". But season 8 also belongs to Chloe as much as it does Clark. She has a lot of heavy stuff this year, and has gone through more than probably anybody else. What are the negatives?. Not much. I have never been a fan of Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, and I don't see adding Justin Hartley as a regular of really bringing much to the table. It seems like he and Clark have the same discussion a lot of the time.

The episodes themselves are a lot of fun, and the season has a much darker tone this year than in seasons past. It begins with ""Odyssey"", which is a typical big Smallville premiere. Other highlights include ""Commited"", where Lois and Clark have to pose as a couple working on a case. ""Bloodline"" sees the return of cousin Kara(Laura Vandervoort)and the phantom zone. ""Bride"" is a biggie. Doomsday makes his big introduction to the gang during Jimmy and Chloe's wedding day. ""Legion"" features the, well, Legion, who help Clark with Chloe when Brainiac takes her over. ""Infamous"" sees the return of Tori Spelling(as hammy as ever)as gossip columnist Linda Lake. ""Beast"" and ""Injustice"" ramp up the series towards it's big finale, ""Doomsday"", which will be airing tomorrow night.

""Smallville"" has had a creative re-birth in season 8. Not many shows can say that in their eighth season, but the new additions to the show have brought with them some very interesting new kinks in the story. The Doomsday storyline, and the complications with Chloe, have been some of the more interesting stuff the show has done. There are surprises, shocks, and characters being severely tested. While it would be nice for Lex and Lana to still be around, I have found myself really getting into this season's story, and I have not missed them. If the show can still be this good and entertaining with new producers and the loss of some favorite characters, while throwing in new dimensions for the story and characters, we should have nothing to worry about with season 9. Smallville is still flying high with one of it's most interesting seasons to date.",1242172800,6,5086,4.704826038159371
3570111,2,B001FB4VZS,"I was deeply disappointed with this season. This is the WORST season by far!!! There is no LEX (okay very brief appearance) and the female character sent to replace him is a feeble replacement for the powerful Lex. There is only a brief appearance by LANA. Smallville spent seven seasons building Lana up as the love of Clark's life and then, to fit the model of Superman, abruptly changes gears and tries to force a relationship between Louise and Clark. Honestly, the show should end with him and Lana together. It would not be in keeping with the traditional makeup of Superman (e.g. comics, movies, other TV shows) but Smallville isn't like every other incarnation of Superman. From the beginning it had distinct differences such as making Clark friends with Lex and especially the relationship Clark has with Lana. In the movie with Christopher Reeves, Lana was a crush he barley had contact with and in Smallville there was this richly developed loving relationship.

The VERY FEW good points of this season is Lana becomes more independent and strong-willed. Also, Chloe becomes more assertive and begins to develop a life where Clark is not the center. Yet, you can still see a pining for the great Clark. Really, they need to let her let that one go and what happened to sweet Jimmy? Chloe is like that Katy Perry song ""Hot n' Cold"" in the end it seems she never truly loved Jimmy because of Clark. I have read in other reviews how Clark begins becoming more of a superhero. That is true but there is still a need to have this process sped up. Really, Clark you can't kill the bad guy. You would rather have the bad guy kill everyone on earth then for you to kill him. Give me a break!! GROW UP!!! Sometimes being a superhero is hard and he needs to start learning that lesson NOW. Season eight to me is simply awful with many of the beloved characters gone and the few that are still around seemed forced to fit the SUPERMAN MODEL that just doesn't apply to Smallville. BE BOLD SMALLVILLE AND BREAK NEW GROUND. THE SHOW DESERVES IT!!!!
Bring back the Smallville that was so great!!",1241827200,6,2091,4.590909090909091
3570112,5,B001FB4VZS,"In my opinion season eight is one of the best seasons of the smallville series.
Lana bites the dust

Oliver is discovered having difficulties in deciphering the dichotomy of good and evil
Jimmy tries to take on doomsday single handedly
Chloe finds herself in a very precarious position with the doomsday character
Clark faces a new threat in Doomsday. Smallville does an excellent job of the doomsday character",1241654400,4,453,4.973684210526316

I won't give away what happens when she leaves again, except to say that it confirmed how much Lois is sloppy seconds.  If you like the whole boring 70 years of Lois and Clark, then you may want to watch this season or just buy Lois and Clark with Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher.  I will give credit to the Legion of Superheroes.  They were pretty cool.  The Hex episode was heard to be pretty lame.

Tom and Erica have great chemistry, and while i'm a little upset that Clark and Lois haven't even kissed yet (they have but they were under spells or didn't know the true identity of the other person), i am extremely please with this season.

I have been with Smallville ever since season 1 and i have to say that it got better with the addition of Lois.

I LOVED season 8 and I'm ecstatic that both Lois and Clark are on the cover for Season 8. It's like a four year anniversary (they were both on season 4 together) and i have to say they look amazing.

3570236,5,B001FB4VZS,"I have been a fan of this amazing show ever since it premiered in October of 2001, and to date, it continues to evolve and flourish into one of the best stories ever told: The life of Clark Kent & his journey to become Superman!

In this season, we see many twists and turns that are quite epic. We are introduced to DOOMSDAY: the only known villain in DC comics that has killed Superman. Things get very intriguing with the introduction of Doomsday in the form of Davis Bloom, Doomsday's human alter ego.

Furthermore, we are also introduced to many more DC villains/heroes, such as Zatanna, the magician, as well as the Legion of Super Heroes, Faora (Zod's wife), Plastique, Livewire, Parasite, Maxima, Bruno Manheim, Toyman, and of course: DOOMSDAY.

Chloe gets a front burner storyline as well as she becomes involved with the Doomsday arc and protecting Clark against him. Tragedy comes for everyone in the spectacular season finale: DOOMSDAY in which the lives of every character is thrown into turmoil and chaos.

Probably the most best arc of this season is the Red-Blue-Blur arc involving Lois and Clark. Lois and Clark's romance begins and it becomes evident in ""Bride"" as they almost share a lip-lock. Erica Durance and Tom Welling's sizzling chemistry has made everyone fall in LOVE with Clois, aka, Clark and Lois. Hats off to the pair of them.

This amazing DVD set includes all 22 episodes of Season 8 with two commentaries on two episodes as well as some other excellent features, such as the origins of Doomsday and deleted scenes.

Some of the best episodes out of this season to look into are:

Doomsday: In the biggest cliffhanger ever, Clark and Doomsday face off in a major fight with 2 major deaths of beloved characters.

Bloodline: Lois becomes possessed by Zod's wife and goes on a rampage.

Infamous: Clark reveals his secret to the world & becomes a celebrity! Nuff' said.

Hex: Zatanna the magician casts Chloe's wish and switches bodies with cousin Lois!

Eternal: We are treated to Davis' background and how he arrived on Earth as Doomsday.

Stiletto: Lois Lane becomes a super heroine in Metropolis!

Injustice: Tess' assembled army of meteor freaks goes up against Doomsday.

Bride: Chloe and Jimmy's wedding gets destroyed by Doomsday kidnapping her.

Identity: Clark is introduced to an identity for himself.

Committed: Lois and Clark are held hostage where they admit their true feelings of love for one another!

Get some popcorn ready and immerse yourself with those spectacular episodes that will amaze you!

Smallville has been renewed for Season 9, with a possible 10th season since rumour has it that Tom Welling signed a two year contract when he signed on for S9. Smallville continues to entertain us and it shows us why is still is the number one show out there! Buy this DVD set now, you will NOT be disappointed!

3570238,5,B001FB4VZS,"WOW! There is such a fresh new energy this year! I can't believe its the same show! The writing for these characters has become so mature! Clark FINALLY mans up & Lois Lane totally ROCKS! Tom Welling & Erica Durance are utterly fantastic as Clark Kent & Lois Lane! Their chemistry is undeniable! And the new villains Tess Mercer & Doomsday are awesome! Mercy is the Lex Luthor protege & she delivers an amazing subtle sinister ore that makes you know that something wicked is coming!

Clark Kent has become such a man this year! I came so close to giving up on this show because of his constant whining & PINING over Lang! It's been refreshing to not have to sit through that up until the amazing and phenominal Bride episode. But no matter how fantastic the Bride episode is, it's disppointing that Lang's brief guest appearance brought that back & that the writers have allowed Clark to regress to his emasculated ways when around her.  The arc that they created for Lang is by far the most ridculous in the shows history, yes, even more so than the witch storyline.

The only other bummer this season is what they have done to Supergirl. They poorly wrote her character then wrote her off the show. Supergirl is part of the Superman mythology & she deserves much better! I hope they bring her back as a regular & repair what they have done!

One thing I'd really like to say is that DC Comics & Warner Brothers need to get over it & allow Wonder Woman & even Bruce Wayne to pop in since all these other background heroes have.

Those things aside, this 8th season has massively ROCKED! I once again look forward to every new episode & more than that, I look forward to every scene with Clark & Lois together! Lois Lane is his future & destiny & the ultimate love of his life! I can't wait to see the legendary love affair begin! These writers have the opportunity to make them EPIC! I hope they do it! I truly hope that the show keeps going and going!

3570239,5,B001FB4VZS,"Well we all can agree that Season 8 has turned out to be a pretty solid year for Smallville with some great episodes (""Identity"", ""Bride"", ""Legion"", ""Infamous"" to name a few!) But ""Prey"" is definately up there with my favorites. It's such an underrated episode! First, Clark makes his debut as the Red-Blue Blur! The sequence of Clark sueprspeeding around Metropolis saving various people, even leaping a tall building in a single bound was truly epic. It was great to see Clark so determined to save lives which is a clear indication that the Man of Steel is about to arrive soon. Then, there was John Jones aka Martain Manhunter who returns as Metropolis' newest detective. It's a great new role for John Jones and obviously inspired by his comic book counterpart. Phil Morris is just excellent throughtout as John as always, especially the speech he gives to Clark about his identity at the end. Then you have Sam Witer as Davis Bloome aka Doomsday giving a terrific performance. Sam, for the first time, made you care about Davis and feel sorry for him. It's a great contrast to how powerful and vicious Doomsday really is. Lastly, there are some unpredictable twists, which Smallville rarely does anymore. We also get some more foreshadowing of Tess' villainous group of meteor freaks aka the Injustice League (who will soon appear in ""Injustice"", episode 21 of this season!)  This episode was an intelligent, darker, maturer brand of Smallville...like the majority of this season has been. The storyines so far this season have been pretty amazing (Chloiac, the Red-Blue Blur and Doomsday) with only one really being lackluster (Lana...of course!)

Bryan Q. Miller delivers again with an in depth character study as well as, dare I say it, a entirely amusing episode . . . on purpose!  Fans were introduced to Zatanna Zatara, wonderfully portrayed by Serinda Swan.  Tom Welling and Erica Durance had dual roles.  Erica played Lois and Chloe (who takes on the appearance of Lois) and Tom played ever growing Clark and a Clark Kent who is a normal newspaperman without the responsibilities of super powers.

I liked the way Clark even changed to the blue red blur in a phone booth once on this one.  Most of the younger viewers may not have caught that one cause they might not know that in the Superman comics often had him changing in a phone booth.  Writers - keep it up - and don't even think about letting Clark get killed by Doomsday as happened in the stupid comic series in the '90's.,1238198400,,512,4.204081632653061

Awesome features for an awesome season.

Now, on to my review...

I've been a fan of the show since day one, but I wasn't expecting much from Season 8.

This time around, Lex and Lana aren't recurring characters. Also, the original producers didn't return. To say the least, I was fearful.

To my pleasant surprise, however, Smallville's eighth season has become my favorite yet. It's darker. It's edgier. Finally, Clark is making the transition from farmboy to superhero.

Don't get me wrong. This season has its missteps, like any other in Smallville's history. But I'd say that, overall, this has been the most entertaining season yet. Here's why...

- Clark is more heroic than ever
- Chloe gets some spotlight for a change
- The Lois and Clark relationship begins to blossom
- Some loose ends are tied (Lex, Lana, Kara)
- More input from the Justice League
- The introduction of Tess Mercer, a worthy replacement for Lex
- Sam Witwer as Doomsday

And let me repeat that. Sam Witwer as Doomsday.

He successfully turns a 2D character with no personality into one of the most intriguing, exciting parts of Smallville history. I think I enjoyed his performances more than any others this season.

Let those Season 7 wounds heal.

Enjoy Season 8 of Smallville.",1237852800,43,1834,4.93485342019544

- More input from the Justice League
- The introduction of Tess Mercer, a worthy replacement for Lex
- Sam Witwer as Doomsday

And let me repeat that. Sam Witwer as Doomsday.

He successfully turns a 2D character with no personality into one of the most intriguing, exciting parts of Smallville history. I think I enjoyed his performances more than any others this season.

Let those Season 7 wounds heal.

Enjoy Season 8 of Smallville.",1237852800,55,1834,4.93485342019544
3570244,5,B001FB4VZS,"Finally the writers did two in a row worth praise. I really liked the depth they've added to David Bloom's character, and to Jimmy. Tess is still Tess and better for it. I don't know what drugs the writers were on three and four episodes before, and the actors for that matter, i'm glad everybody is sober and doing Smallville right again.

Infamous provded the needed kick to keep my interest for a few more. I need to see at least three consistent consecutive episodes with this quality to know somebody back at the group had been permanently let go. Looking forward to the future.

3570350,4,B001FB4VZS,"Look I will admit the series has seen better episode arcs. And I am also positive they are trying to wrap up Smallville so there won't be a huge fan out-cry and online petitions to bring the show back. But that is no reason to pan the season and the series.

Smallville has to be one of the longest running live-action superhero television shows out there. Honestly besides Watchmen, this is all DC has going for it. ;) Smallville's use of recycled sci-fi actors makes me feel nostalgic and I enjoy seeing fresh characters even if they are for only one episode.

They are doing the best they can with what they have, and I think it is worth the time to watch it. Enjoy each episode as you never know if it will be the last. :D",1236729600,,726,4.253623188405797
3570351,4,B001FB4VZS,"My family and I are recent Smallville addicts and we burned through the first seven seasons on DVD.  We just caught up to the current episodes, and I'm really enjoying Season 8 so far.  There's a lot of interaction with characters from the comic book universe (Green Arrow/'Toxic,' Maxima, Doomsday), and that's fun to see for someone who was raised on Superfriends every Saturday morning.  Clark Kent gets to be more of an adult ('Bulletproof').  Chloe has a lot to do this season, and we get to see many different sides of her and different possibilities for her character ('Abyss,' 'Identity').  Both Lana ('Requiem') and Lois ('Bride') fans can find episodes to warm their hearts.  I'm having more fun than watching this season, and I think I'll look back and this will be my favorite.  I like Requiem because there are some really fun Clark and Lana moments and I think the creators throw in some really interesting twists in the storyline.  This may be one of those episodes for the fans of Smallville that loyal fans of Superman struggle with.",1236297600,,1050,4.762430939226519
3570352,5,B001FB4VZS,COMMITTED was the most inspiring episode of Smallville to date.  Clark and Lois doing what they do in every other incarnation.  Kudos to Bryan Q Miller for a great script and Glen Miller for awesome direction.  5 stars!!!,1235520000,,221,4.7631578947368425

3570354,1,B001FB4VZS,"I thought the acting was particularly flat. I don't know what's going on with Lana only that perhaps her contract requries her to still be on the show. Why is lex out of the picture - is he pregnant or something? I've not been this dissapointed in what was a solid creative show than now. Please tell me this is a guest director, or some sort of spoof that will be somehow undone by a time machine or something much more plausable than the action in the past two episodes.

It hurts, like watching your child fail only you can't be there in any way to make it better other than resign and go watch Friends reruns.",1234656000,3,613,4.239316239316239
3570443,5,B001FB4VZS,"MAY BE SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED:  ""Legion"" is written by Geoff Johns, easily one of the best Superman writers ever.  The proof is here.  Shortly, Johns does in one episode what few writers manage to do in entire story arcs: prove Superman/Clark right.  Clark doesn't just refuse to kill.  He FINDS ANOTHER WAY.  That's the essence of Superman. Dumb luck doesn't present him a way out--he USES HIS BRAIN!  I didn't know from previous seasons that Clark even had one! For the first time in this series, there's some indication that Clark may not actually be super-retarded. With all the power at his disposal to easily eliminate any and all enemies, his refusal to kill sets him apart from so many others.  He devises the method with which they defeat Brainiac.  This is the same guy who has risked destroying the entire world because he didn't listen to his remarkably unfather-like father (who actively seemed to hate him), when he tried to tell him, ""If you don't do what I say, the world's gonna die!""  Well, watch the episode.  Buy it.  It's worth the price of the season in my book.",1234569600,,1093,4.635416666666667
3570444,1,B001FB4VZS,"Two in a row.  Two of the worst Smallville--no, two of the worst episodes of any show (and I watched G vs E, as well as Forever Knight) written by high school graduates.  I've been a Superman fan since I was 3 and my father took me to my first movie (Superman, of course).  Smallville has always teased me and other fanboys with its potential, but never delivered. Horrible acting, writing, overall plot execution, terrible continuity, and general disdain for its fans with I.Q.'s above 75.  This season was so different.  The first 11 episodes were the best of the entire series.  A fanboy's dream come true.  In 2 episodes, they've taken me from passive disappointment to active hatred.  The only way I'll support a season 9 is if they ""Newhart"" these 2 episodes.  Clark wakes up in the next episode, and says ""What a horrible dream!  Man, I'd have to be on kryptonite crack to write something that bad!"" Later...Oliver: ""What happened to Lana?"" Clark: ""Who?""  OLIVER: ""Lana?  Your girlfriend...sorta?  You know, the one who has retarded superpowers and is now running around the world doing...probably nothing more important than whining and manipulating men into doing things for her because she's either too lazy or selfish to do it herself? Hopefully, her powers played out in the desert, and she never found her way out, cause I was really sick of having her around; but, I digress...Oh, by the way, I killed Lex's stand-in.  I think."" CLARK:""No, really, Oliver, I have no idea wtf you're talking about.  Have you been hitting the pipe?"" Yeah.  Then I'd watch a season 9.  Maybe even buy the pass.",1234569600,3,1604,4.753623188405797
3570445,1,B001FB4VZS,"I've loved/hated Smallville for years.  It's the one show that's always had me locked in on hope alone, never because they delivered the goods.  Such potential, always squandered.  This season, I thought it'd be different.  And, up to the ""Legion"" episode, it was.  Literally, a fanboy's dream season.  But, ""Power"" is the SINGLE WORST EPISODE OF ANY SHOW EVER FILMED ON ANY NETWORK OR PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNEL.  HTF did this get greenlighted?  I wanted to cancel my season pass after watching this!  I wanted to smash my laptop against the wall to exact vengeance for this...mindrape of a tv show!  This episode is disgusting, to say the least.  It's convinced me of one thing that 7 years of mediocrity couldn't: this show must end this season.  No more chances.  End it, before you make me hate Superman forever.",1234569600,,812,4.797101449275362
3570446,5,B001FB4VZS,"A mentor of mine some years ago, noted psychologist Erik H. Erikson, studied the stages relative to youth, identity, and crisis.  SMALLVILLE, in many ways, recapitulates the stages of human development across a spectrum of characters: Clark, Chloe, Lois, Lex, and an array of ""outsider"" characters as in outsider art.  With great special effects, a cast of characters who have been present for the most part for eight seasons, a clear season to season progression of growth via experimentation, exploration, growth, and in several characters, notably Lex, a regression to the shadow-self - SMALLVILLE is a fine study of conflicting emotions, judgement calls, life defining moments, and in Clark a deep conflict relative to the question of who he is to become in a human world in which he is more human in compassion than most humans yet not human in his core psyche: a Kryptonian, of course.  Now, the main negative I have observed with each season is the dulling effect on plot progression caused by Lana Lang mania on the part of Clark.  The plot is somewhat stalled in the Lana Lang hangup Clark has for her.  I'd much rather see a playful relationship between Clark and Lois.  On a positive now, SMALLVILLE is the first treatment of the Superman tradition that does not put clark in tights, a cape, and so on, all of which would make him look like a circus dropout!  Bottom line: If you enjoy epic superhero tales that you can view over eight seasons, a type of study of youth, identity, crisis, and growth to the rim of manhood and womanhood (Lois, Chloe, Lana, etc.) -- then give smallville a shot.  It's great action.  Each episode, especially on DVD or Unboxed, is theater quality.  I hope to see a ninth and tenth season, for there is so much material the show's writers can draw upon to make a current excellent SMALLVILLE into a great SMALLVILLE.",1234137600,,1857,4.739130434782608
3570447,1,B001FB4VZS,Been watching for every season and finally felt like they are off in la la land with that plot and about 1/3 of the dialog. It's like everybody is on drugs or something. The acting was frankly horible from everyone from Clark to Tess. It felt like some kids from highschool ran a video production project with about as much depth. So bumbed.,1234051200,,341,4.428571428571429
3570448,4,B001FB4VZS,"This 10th episode had a few surprises to the casual viewer of Smallville. One good thing was that Clark and Lana finally closed the door on their relationship and Lois and Clark ""almost"" kissed.  I never liked the ""Doomsday"" character because in the comics he's the one that killed Superman.  The ending of this one leaves a lot un-resolved and we have to wait at least 2 weeks to see the next one due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Smallville remains one of my favorite shows of all times, though. I hope they have yet another season after this one and then go on to make some major motion pictures with all of these fabulous actors.",1227916800,2,632,4.48695652173913

3570451,2,B001FB4VZS,This episode was a dissapointing disconnected drama that made little sense. The villan was underdeveloped and the premise of torture for marital bliss was just wierd and almost uninteresting. the twist with Lois and Clark was really good but they didn't take it far enough to make it meaningful.
