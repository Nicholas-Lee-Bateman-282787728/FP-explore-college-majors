7813776,4,6301689674,"""Ever see a goalie make a rump save? Watch John Davidson play a ketchup bottle? Wonder what the players on the ice are saying to each other? Well wonder no more, because Super Dooper Hockey Bloopers is here, with more hilarious flubs, falls, and foul-ups than an evening with the California Golden Seals. And there's much, much more: Board-splintering collisions; rare hickey music videos; Gretzky, Lemieux, and Yzerman at their most electrifying; the best - and the weirdest - goals of the season; the debut of an original song on the great names of hockey; and the clumsiest plays of the year. It's all here, in Super Dooper Hockey Bloopers.""",1372204800,,644,4.863636363636363
