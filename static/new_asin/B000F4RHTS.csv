2551123,2,B000F4RHTS,"Considering I only have seen the first half hour of this film (some of us have to work), I agree with the first reviewer who said Susan Lucci's acting is soap opera-ish at best.  Susan seems past her heyday in this movie, and it's a role I thought would've been played better by a somewhat younger actress like Diane Lane or even Angelina Jolie.  Susan looks old and haggard - makes me wonder what a guy like her lover actually sees in her, or why he would go to such extremes to attempt killing her rich husband.  Here's a thought that crossed my mind - why do so many women married to wealthy men think their lives are so bad that they have to cheat?  If I was married to someone with money I would just appreciate that I don't have to work and can spend my days looking pretty and shopping.  So much for marrying for love.",1212537600,3,825,4.19620253164557
2551124,2,B000F4RHTS,"A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims, along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine, and here Susan Lucci performs as a siren, although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one.  Isabelle (Lucci), inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for Richard, apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent.  When Davis becomes convinced that guileful Isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband, he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself, coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent Stewart.  In the wake of the hitman's assault upon Collins, a pair of police detectives, performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become increasingly curious concerning Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured Richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering.  Lucci and Kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators, each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements.  Released upon a Fremantle DVD,  this largely lustreless affair depicting a man 'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality, and although no extra features are provided, the above-average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.",1172448000,6,2322,5.162234042553192
8117342,1,B000F4RHTS,"This movie reminds me of that episode of The Simpsons where some financial motivator boasts of how he saves money and says, you see these beautiful women on the boat in this picture, they used to be men.  Obviously the budget for this one was pretty low, as the central character is supposedly a woman of immense beauty who even cops make comments of how hot she is when leaving her house or refer to her as a babe, and hope she goes skinny dipping on their watch.  However it seems all the studios could afford was an old skeletal looking woman who looked old enough to be these cops grandmother and not believable at all to have a ten year old daughter, or be able to seduce any male she came across.

The movie does start off with John O'Hurley as her husband, so you've at least got the pleasant reminder of Seinfeld going through your mind as you see him in action.  You're waiting for some sort of J Peterman speech to kick in, such as she walked up the spiral staircase, wearing a jacket woven from the finest nasal hairs from the camels of Persian royalty.  But alas he's not in the movie long.  Once he's gone the slow pace and predictability of this movie kicks into a new gear.  Even with a younger more believable actress in the role, the character of Isabelle Collins is a pretty dislikable one, perhaps the final scene she's in with the ten year old meant no actress who was young enough to want a career after this movie wanted to play a character who would be remembered for doing such a thing.",1476576000,,1510,4.333333333333333

8117351,1,B000F4RHTS,"I started watching this on TV last night...only because I couldn't WAIT to see this woman get her just desserts.  The fact that she didn't makes you wonder if even those who made the movie were under her spell!

Susan Lucci is NOT a good actress.  Her helpless, wide-eyed sugary sweet smile (inflicted on everyone, even her daughter) is overdone, and her every gesture, every look, conveys her absorption with her own beauty. (And I do think she has the kind of glamor needed to play a seductress).  I realize she was supposed to be ""putting on an act"" in the movie, but I got the impression that all this phony ""over-acting"" came a bit too naturally for her!

This could have been a good movie if they had changed the ending and used an actress with a little more spice and a little less sugar.

I have only myself to blame for getting sucked into it...",1264550400,3,854,4.407643312101911
