8059559,2,B0009ESSVU,"Frankly, this movie is about as interesting as picking a stranger and following him or her around for a few days, just observing what they do.  To make it a bit more interesting, say you followed this person on their vacation.  That's it.  The only reason I bought this movie is because the DVD cover says it is about a young woman who coaches a young boy on how to behave with girls.  [I am fairly sure that I have the world's largest privately owned DVD collection of movies dealing with children and teens - over 4000 so far.]  However, that segment is so short in comparison to the rest of the movie, it can't really be said that is what the story is mostly about.

The one good aspect of the movie is that much of the acting is so natural that one could think it really was a secretly filmed conversation between two people.  For this quality, it could be studied by acting students.",1203379200,2,888,4.313253012048193
8059560,2,B0009ESSVU,"it was hard to watch because nothing happened , i had to take a break from it and finish watching it later on, very boring i am from argentina,and like to hear the language and the look at the countryside,that was the only reason i saw it till the end,there was no plot, like home movies",1198627200,,287,4.142857142857143
8059561,2,B0009ESSVU,"Despite good acting and a couple of amusingly realistic interactions between the characters, this tale of a young Argentine woman who returns from Buenos Aires to her hometown of Parana, sells her parents' house, attends a school reunion and then seeks to reunite with a former boyfriend is extremely uninvolving.  The film drags and you never feel sympathy towards Ana, the protagonist.

That is, until the movie's sole highlight: an excellent sequence in which the protagonist teaches a small kid how to court a girl. Its so touching and funny that one wishes the filmmakers would have included more scenes like that.

The film also presumes too much familiarity with recent Argentine history.  Without that background, the film won't seem to have a point.  I would only recommend, and far from enthusiastically, the movie to die-hard fans of Argentine or Latin American cinema.",1139875200,6,880,5.125874125874126
8059562,1,B0009ESSVU,"I was excited to receive this movie yesterday so i quickly popped it in the dvd player and watched it to it's conclusion. I thought it might pick up sometime in the middle of the flick. But to my dismay it just dragged on for the entire length of the movie. This wouldn't be good as a rental. This useless piece of celuloid was about as much fun as a prostate exam. P.S. If i should ever run out of toilet tissue at home,i can always use this DVD to remedy the problem.
