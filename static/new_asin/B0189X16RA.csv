The proliferation of string quartets (and by that I mean the grouping of musicians as a performing entity) has been positively dizzying over the last 30 years.  For those who grew up with the standard Julliard Quartet, Guarneri Quartet, etc. there were just a few outstanding names in this genre.  However since the advent of the new quartets like Kronos and then Turtle Island, Arditti,etc. the field has expanded rather prolifically. Couple this with a boom in string quartet writing notably Elliot Sharp, John Zorn, Wolfgang Rihm. Elliot Carter, Peter Maxwell-Davies, Ben Johnston among many others and I was filled with some trepidation upon receiving this disc for review.  I mean, how many things can you do with a string quartet?

Apparently there is a great deal more to be explored in this genre.  I am happy to say that these folks are up to the task as are the composers whose work they present.  Serious Business is some seriously interesting music performed with serious skill by this new quartet, the Spektral Quartet.  They are the string quartet in residence at the University of Chicago, itself a venerable place for new music.

We start here with a piece by Sky Macklay called Many Many Cadences (2014) a piece that seems to come from a similar place to that of the work of Conlon Nancarrow with intricate rhythms within a somewhat conservative tonal idiom.  The title is suggestive of Gertrude Stein (Many, Many Women).  It was commissioned for the Spektral Quartet by the Walden School.  The piece is immediately engaging and ultimately satisfying.

The second piece, The Ancestral Mousetrap (2014) by David Reminick features a less common use of a string quartet in that there is a vocal component. This is not the vocalist component pioneered by Schoenberg in his second quartet.  These vocalizations are performed by the quartet.  This is no simple feat either because the vocal writing is itself a challenge in its rhythmic complexity.  The piece resembles a little opera and indeed the text by poet Russell Edson is here called a libretto.  This piece was commissioned by the Spektral Quartet.

The third piece here is an unusual choice (and the only one not commissioned for the Spektral Quartet) which is explored in the liner notes .  Haydn's Quartet Op. 33 No. 2, subtitled ""The Joke"" is one of the relatively few examples of attempts at program music (vs absolute music) to be found in the classical era.  First, no one will buy this disc just for the Haydn. Second, many collectors will already have this Haydn piece in their collection.  But with that said this is a lovely performance of one of the emblematic pieces of music that created the need for the performing ensemble known as the string quartet and it is a lovely performance as well.  I will leave it to other listeners to read the program notes and get into the rationale about its inclusion here.

The final piece, Hack (2015) by Chris Fisher-Lochead is perhaps the most unusual of the lot in that the composer uses vocal inflections by a collection of comedians (yes, comedians) as the source for his rhythmic and melodic contours and creates 22 separate pieces about 16 comedians (some get more than one piece).  This piece requires more concentration by the listener but, like any well-written piece, it reveals more of itself with repeated listenings.  The Barlow Endowment at Brigham Young University commissioned this piece for the Spektral Quartet.

The Spektral Quartet is Clara Lyon, violin; Austin Wulliman, violin; Doyle Armbrust, viola; Russell Rollen, cello.  The recording, as with every Sono Luminus release I've heard is glorious and lucid.",1468713600,,3693,4.924071082390953

8741821,5,B0189X16RA,"The Spektral Quartet is not a ""new music quartet"".  Unlike the Arditti Quartet and the Kronos Quartet, playing new music is just a part (albeit an important part) of their mission and their musicianship.  This does not mean, of course, that they do not play new music as well as a group for whom that genre is the primary focus.  In fact, the recordings of the new pieces on this disc are some of the finest performances of contemporary string quartets in the last twenty years.  What makes this album and this group most remarkable, however, is that fact that sandwiched between these contemporary chop-busters is a marvelous performance of a Haydn quartet, as original in its interpretation and as full of musical delights as the pieces around it (try to imagine either of the aforementioned string quartets performing Haydn...).

Amongst the contemporary pieces, the variety is similarly impressive.  Far from having an axe to grind, the Spektrals embrace a panoply of musical aesthetics, devoting themselves not to an overarching and unified notion of what music should be but to the idiosyncratic musical demands of a specific composer and a specific piece.  Sky Macklay's ""Many Many Cadences"" combines high-brow wit and physical exuberance - an impressive display of compositional deftness that manages to sound uniquely modern while at the same time referencing centuries-old musical traditions.  Dave Reminick's ""The Ancestral Moustrap"", a setting of the poems of Russell Edson in which the quartet members sing, is infectious.  It is probably the most finely wrought work on the disc, bursting with detail and nuance - but for all its craft, it never fails to engage the body and provoke a smile.  It is so much FUN.  Chris Fisher-Lochhead's ""Hack"", based on transcriptions of standup comics, is startling in the breadth of its language.  Like the medium that it draws on, it can be violent and unpredictable, coy, boorish, wry, cerebral, nervous, scatological, and deeply sad.  The quartet manages to execute the score's extreme difficulties while still making excellent chamber music and presenting a coherent musical intention.

In addition to the extremely high level of playing, musicianship, and collaboration on display here, the recording itself is ravishing.  Sono Luminus is known for the unimpeachable quality of their recordings and this disc does not disappoint.",1454198400,2,2384,5.2204724409448815
8741822,5,B0189X16RA,Fabulous album filled with many wonderful musical surprises. The talent of this group as well as the composers they work with is top notch. Prepare to have your mind blown,1454112000,,171,4.733333333333333
8741823,5,B0189X16RA,"Awesome and exciting new record from one of my favorite quartets to see live. I especially recommend The Ancestral Mousetrap by David Reminick - weird, cool and beautiful all at the same time. And the quartet sings while playing!",1454025600,,229,4.897435897435898
8741824,5,B0189X16RA,"It's exciting to finally have recordings of many pieces I've enjoyed hearing Spektral Quartet perform live. There's a bit of everything in here. Diverse, unique, and never boring.",1454025600,,179,5.428571428571429
8741825,5,B0189X16RA,"have been listening to the album all morning and am already on my second run through the playlist. spektral sounds as phenomenal as ever. the new pieces are strange in all the best ways, and this rendition of the haydn is remarkable (the slurpy slides in the allegro are hilarious, entirely in a ""laughing with them"" kind of way). in isolation each performance is incredible, but combining them in one album is uniquely thought-provoking (musically and in terms of the performative aspects of humor, but also as to our evolving sense of what's ""funny"") and--at least for me--presents new music in its most accessible context, i.e., by referencing and establishing a connection with something more familiar before taking you in an entirely new direction.",1454025600,4,753,5.080645161290323
