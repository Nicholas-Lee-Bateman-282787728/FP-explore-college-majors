8649214,5,B00JAAOTR6,"This is a great final concert of Claudio Abbado conducting the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, August, 2013.  The Lucerne fesival players and audience had no way of knowing Abbado would die just 5 months later: January 20, 2014.

The Brahms ""Tragic"" Overture is like chamber music, the interplay of different instruments/orchestral textures very intimate and well voiced in the quieter passages.  The Lucerne orchestra plays with a lightness and delicacy, but there is power a'plenty when a crescendo happens, or there is a loudly accented note.  I also have Abbado/Berlin Philharmonic in this piece (DG CD) so am thankful to have both recordings: Berlin, and this newly released Lucerne.

""Song of the Wood Dove"" is not familiar to me, but sounds more tonal than much of Schoenbergs' output after 1908.  Schoenberg's harmonic language and orchestration are much like Mahler or Richard Strauss!  Soloist Mihoko Fujimara, also new to me, sings beautifully and helps make Schoenberg's chromatic writing and rich orchestration come to life.

Abbado's final ""Eroica"" Symphony recording, presented here, uses NO vibrato in the strings, which may bother some; it did NOT bother me at all...
the Marche Funebre drips with intensity and meaning.  Abbado was influenced by the period instrument movement and vibratoless string playing the last 15 years of his life, and it shows here.

I bought the regular DVD version (Non BluRay) and it is very beautiful in sight and sound.  Highly recommended.",1422835200,3,1484,5.245762711864407

Excellen seller! A++++++",1419811200,,35,8.0
8649216,5,B00JAAOTR6,"Essential. Just listen to the Funeral March and compare it with Abbado's lean and late Beethoven cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic. I love that cycle, especially the Rome live performances but they are driven, intense and joyful. Here the Eroica takes on a weight that must have something to do with his health, his sense of time and what he has left. It is difficult not to read into the fact that it is his last filmed performance. How would I feel about it if I didn't know that??? Mmmmmm..... Well....I guess the bottom line is that it IS his last filmed performance and the playing is beautiful, deep and rich. The Lucerne orchestra, full of legendary players, clearly loves their conductor and would march through the trenches for him. Great disc. Amazing Beethoven. Bravo! Love live Claudio!",1413417600,5,799,4.797101449275362
8649217,5,B00JAAOTR6,It may be just a coincidence that this was his last recording but you almost felt that this was HIS funeral march!,1409616000,,114,4.2272727272727275
8649218,5,B00JAAOTR6,Establishes a very good case that these are the finest performances of this music. Both the music performed and the performances of the music provide a masterly experience..,1404518400,4,173,5.214285714285714
8649219,5,B00JAAOTR6,"This wonderful, life-affirming concert is the last video recording of a performance by Maestro Abbado. His performances with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra were the pinnacle of a long and glorious career. Abbado managed to make every piece, no matter how rich in texture, sound like chamber music. You felt the musicians listening to each other and making music together, rather than simply following the conductor.

The Brahms Tragic Overture is played with searing intensity and incredible tonal beauty in the lyrical moments. The excerpts from Sch&ouml;nberg's Gurrelieder are remarkable! The playing of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra is staggering. The beauty and depth of tone of the strings is without equal and the handpicked woodwind and brass sections play with an amazing range of colors. Mihoko Fujimura sings the ""Song of the Wood Dove"" with great beauty and intenstity. The Beethoven Eroica Symphony performance is the finest I have ever heard. The Funeral March is shattering and deeply moving.

Maestro Abbado's was always searching for the emotional, existential truth behind the notes and that is evident in every phrase of this concert. It is a perfect memorial to this great Maestro.",1402099200,18,1202,5.321052631578947
