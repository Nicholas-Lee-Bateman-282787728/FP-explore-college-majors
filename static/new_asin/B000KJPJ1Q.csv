These movies were similar to the horror films that were popular then. People are threatened by an evil person but survive the threat. That symbolized the Great Depression (horror films are popular in bad economic times, look at the vampire and zombie shows on TV). For more details see the reviews for each individual movie.

""Sabotage"" was based on a novel of Joseph Conrad (""The Secret Agent""). It is a story about a terrorist who plants a bomb at a crowded location. But this agent is being watched! So Verloc used the son of a friend to carry the package to that location. Will it go as planned? Will the police catch the bomber? Will there be a happy ending?

""The Secret Agent"" was taken from a stage play based on the novel ""Ashenden"" (dark chamber). It was a fictionalized version of Somerset Maugham's work as a secret agent. He was sent to Switzerland (a neutral country) to find an unknown German agent and stop him frm traveling to Arabia, and to survive (unlike his predecessor). Will something go wrong, or will he succeed?",1412640000,,1073,4.636842105263158
