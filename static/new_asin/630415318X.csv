796852,4,630415318X,"It is a wonderful blend of action, adventure, romance and just the right touch of comedy, even if occasionally absurd.  Anthony Quinn's characterization of the Portuguee would have stolen this film from a lesser actor than Gregory Peck, but he manages to hold up his end quite well.  Ann Blyth is regal enough to play any royal.  She hardly sings in this film at all.  I always enjoy The World in His Arms.",972172800,19,406,4.52054794520548

797353,5,630415318X,"Previously available only as part of a box set of Peck films, this is a lesser-known example of the actor's work that doesn't deserve its fate.  Filled with action, color, and romance, it's set during the 1850's, when Alaska belonged to Russia and foreigners took their lives in their hands if they ventured to the foggy Pribilof Islands in search of fur-seal pelts.  Among the most notorious (in the Russians' opinion) and successful of these is Jonathan Clark (Peck), ""the Boston man,"" captain of the two-masted schooner ""Pilgrim of Salem,"" which can outsail any craft in Sitka.  Though he appreciates the money to be had by sealing, Clark is a forward-looking man and realizes that the unrestrained methods practiced by the Russians will exterminate the seals before too long, so he conceives of a bold plan: assemble a syndicate of wealthy San Franciscans to buy Alaska--Pribilofs and all--and then limit the kill to the ""bachelor"" seals, the excess young males who don't have harems and usually die without reproducing anyway.  So off to Gold-Rush-era Frisco he goes to hobnob with the wealthy, and there he meets a ""little Russian girl"" and falls head over heels in love.  What he doesn't know is that she's the Countess Marina Selanova (Ann Blyth) and is fleeing from an arranged marriage with Prince Semyon (Carl Esmond), a nephew of the Czar, whom she hates.  Her only hope is to get to Sitka, where her Uncle Ivan (Sig Ruman) is the Governor and may be able to provide her with protection.  Knowing that Clark has a ship, her first thought has been to maneuver him into allowing her to charter it--but she falls just as hard for him.  Then Semyon follows her to San Francisco aboard the Czar's brand-new steam-driven gunboat and literally kidnaps her out of the hotel, leaving a bewildered Clark waiting at the altar.  Not until, having nothing left to lose, he heads back to Alaska and is captured and thrown into prison, do they meet again and he learns the truth.  And when Marina agrees to marry Semyon if he will free Clark and his crew, Clark realizes how much she truly loves him.  Now Semyon has made an enemy he'll live to regret.

Besides the love story and the environmental message (which suggests that it really is possible for even high demand to walk hand in hand with a sensible stewardship of the world around us), this movie has several other things going for it: the San Francisco scenes, ranging from the shanghai dens of the Barbary Coast to a luxury hotel filled with both the young city's Best People and some of its raunchiest (like Clark's friend, saloonowner Mamie (Andrea King)); a sea race between two sealing craft; several good brawls; and an array of lesser characters including Clark's educated first officer, ""Deacon"" Greathouse of Nova Scotia (John McIntire); his master harpooner the Aleut Ogeechuk (Bill Radovich), whose sole command of English seems to amount to ""We go!""; Eustace (Hans Conreid), the snooty hotel owner who finds himself coping with Clark, his boisterous crew, and the less-than-staid followers they bring with them; Marina's companion and kinswoman Anna (Eugenie Leontovich), prone to vapors and hysterics, and her bodyguard, Col. Paul Shushaldin (Gregory Gay); and above all Anthony Quinn as ""the Portygee,"" captain of the ""Isabella,"" a laughing, brawling, larcenous pirate of a sealer who's nevertheless, as even Clark admits, ""a good sailor,"" and who when the chips are down proves a loyal and valuable ally--a role that should have won him at least a nomination for Best Supporting Oscar.  This has been a favorite film of mine since I stumbled across it on TV many years ago, and I was delighted to find it available on a free-standing DVD.",1340064000,2,3710,4.879173290937997

Directed by Raoul Walsh

Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn play two seal-hunting rivals in this adventure film set in the days when Alaska was a Russian territory. Peck is adventuring seafarer Jonathan Clark, who falls in love with Russian Countess Marina Selanova (Ann Blyth) while the countess is in San Francisco fleeing an arranged marriage to the vile Prince Semyon (Carl Esmond). The Countess wants to hire a ship to take her to Sitka, AK, where her uncle, General Ivan Vorashilov (Sig Rumann), is governor.

Portugee (Quinn) can't raise money for the voyage, so the countess agrees to sail with Clark (Peck), and the two quickly fall in love. But Prince Semyon sails into San Francisco just as Clark and the Countess are about to be wed, and the prince abducts her and takes her to Alaska, threatening to kill her uncle if she doesn't marry him. Clark and Portugee then agree to race to Alaska, with the winner getting the other's ship and the seal catch. Clark's boat wins the race, but the Russians arrest both the men as seal poachers. Countess Marina agrees to marry Semyon if he will order the seal hunters released.

What is the outcome, well purchase or rent the film and your questions will be answered.

Excellent big-scale adventure story!

797426,1,630415318X,"I saw the movie ""The World In His Arms"" the other night and have to say now that this is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.  I know for a fact that Gregory Peck did not make this movie to advance his career, as it would have been a career ender for any lesser actor.  It was so bad I turned it off after 15 minutes as I couldn't stand the stupidity of the plot and the wretched acting any longer.  Gregory Peck portrays a sea captain and poacher(illegal as far as I know) who for some reason is wildly popular and is known far and wide for his exploits of poaching seal pelts in Alaska.  Anthony Quinn is a rival sea captain who come across as a babbling idiot who probably doesn't know what water is.  Ann Blyth is a member of the Russian monarchy who could probably rival Quinn's character in the stupidity department.  There is bartender with the nickname ""Shanghai Jack"".  Guess what he does as a sideline to running a saloon?  There is an Eskimo who is part of the crew who only grunts all his answers.  All in all I would have to say ""STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE"".  If someone gives it to you as a gift, give it to Goodwill or toss it in the trash.

p.s.  Does anyone know if it is bad luck to put a hat on your bed?  For some idiotic reason Peck's character flings dozens of hat's on the floor of his hotel room as he shouts that putting hats on a bed is bad luck.",1311638400,,1375,4.048148148148148

797430,5,630415318X,"I just bought the DVD and this engaging film is just as exciting today as it was when I first saw it as a boy. Seems I have a soft spot for these adventure movies (see my review of His Majesty O'Keefe). Gregory Peck was never better in this well-written story of a bigger-than-life sea captain in 1850 who dreams of buying Alaska from the Russians. His worthy love interest is the charming Ann Blyth. The supporting cast is impeccable, with Anthony Quinn (obviously enjoying himself), John McIntyre, Hans Conreid, Carl Esmond, Rhys Williams, Peck's crazy eskimo side-kick, and a scene-stealing seal by the name of Louise. The highlight of the movie is the hair-raising and beautifully filmed schooner chase up in the Pribilov Islands off the Alaskan coast. Raoul Walsh knew how to direct these entertaining swashbucklers better than just about anyone. I hate to say it, but they just don't make them like this anymore, a pity. Add in the incredible musical score by Frank Skinner, truly unforgettable as it was the memory of the music after all these years that motivated me to buy the DVD.",1287187200,2,1090,4.772486772486772

797535,3,630415318X,"In old San Francisco, Marina Selanova (Ann Blyth) - a dark-haired Russian countess on the run from imminent union to the ambitious prince Semyon (Carl Esmond) - implores Captain Jonathan Clark (Gregory Peck) to take her to Alaska after been rejected by his eternal rival Portugee (Anthony Quinn).

Jonathan, an American seal pirate, falls for the diminutive, fresh-faced brunette, while giving her a midnight tour of San Francisco--an impressive similar situation to Peck-Audrey Hepburn in William Wyler's ""Roman Holiday.""

On the eve of their wedding day, her odious Russian fianc kidnaps her, and sails for Alaska taking her on his gunboat... He promises to kill her uncle unless she married him as it was originally planned...

The film's highlight is the outstanding windswept race between two boats led by Peck and Quinn from San Francisco harbor to the Fur Seal Islands off the coast of Alaska, with the winner acquiring the other's ship and crew to rescue the lovely heroine...

With her slightly oriental eyes and pleasant lyric soprano voice, Ann Blyth provides feminine decoration for this epic adventure...

Anthony Quinn gives a high-spirited performance as the cunning, sympathetic thief... Quinn is challenged in the film in a 'trial of strength,' an amusing drinking and wrestling bout..

Raoul Walsh's direction is simple, direct and muscular... As a popular entertainer he is confident with a sense of humor... His actions, fury, spirit, skill, ambition and unrestrained dreams remain his forte...",1234310400,7,1514,5.313807531380753
797536,3,630415318X,"The World in this Arms was always one of my favorite childhood movies.  Gregory Peck's dark good looks and quiet demeanor has always reminded me of my father, and I watch Peck's movies with a sweet nostalgia.  Is it a great movie?  Not at all, but it's fun.  The parts are all so stereotypically drawn and none of the roles demand much from the actors.  Still, Peck stands strong and, given the nature of this picture, still manages to give ""The Boston Man"" some depth, which is not what the rest of the cast does.  The women (my usual complaint) are drawn as one-dimensional.  They are either good girls or bad girls.  That was the most tiresome thing about the old films as a rule.  But the same goes for the rest of the roles in the usual old Hollywood fare.

The costumes were basically fine except for the women's roles and in that respect they were not historical or especially believable.  The costumes of Ann Blyth, leading lady, were all prom gowns and all off-sholder.  The gowns of her lady-in-waiting were realistic, but the gowns and coifs of the bevy of ""good-hearted dance hall girls"" were beyond the pale.  Still very colorful and fancy.  A period drama?  Hardly.  A costume drama, yes, but not a good one.

Anthony Quinn gives a nice, buffoonish character to the antagonist, and while it is stereotypical, it is also enjoyable and speaks to his greater talent as does Peck's work. And the sea.

797540,5,630415318X,"Raoul Walsh was a great director. Only he could have done a film like this. In other's director hands this would have been only another adventure film, but Walsh had that touch. The touch of make films that had everything. He knew how to make a sailing race, and a romantic scene. He was impecable.

Our hero, always dashing Gregory Peck, has a dream, he also has a bizarre crew, but it is his dream who leads him to a great adventure. He wants to find money to buy Alaska from his Imperial Majesty the Czar. So he goes to san Francisco to sell the seal pelts he has and to find the money.

Here comes the girl , Countess Marina Selonova, Ann Blyth, who is trying to scape from an arranged marriage. Being at the same hotel our captain thinks that the lovely girl he has just met is a ""lady of the night"". But because he is an open minded captain, he falls in love with her.

Of course villains are everywhere. The Portuguese wants Peck's vessel, Prince Semyon wants his girl, his crew wants seals pelts. And so all together sail to Pribiloff Islands where true love, and good business will win.

Wonderful cast with a great John McIntire and Anthony Quinn . A nice seal and her Inuit friend and spectacular images. Who could ask for anything more?",1100736000,34,1248,4.366379310344827
797541,3,630415318X,"Yawn.  A fairly dull ""historical"" romantic adventure tale starring Gregory Peck as a bon vivant schooner captain whose sailing run, between Russian-owned Alaska and the newly founded San Francisco boomtown, brings him into conflict with the Tsarist forces in charge of the far North.  The film starts out with great promise, but grinds to a halt with a slow-moving romantic plot involving the rather unappealing, pinch-faced Ann Blythe.  Unfortunately, when he finally gets back to sea, the action sequences are hardly more lively, or better directed.  What was up with this film?  Was it just a bad season for director Raoul Walsh?  Well, whatever it was, I was mucho bored for much of this film.  I did manage to amuse myself with the thought that the loquacious John McIntire's character would stay up in Alaska after the film's end and later found the town of Skagway, which he would rule with an evil, iron fist.  (See: ""The Far Country,"" from 1954, if you want to get the joke...)  Anthony Quinn also co-stars, in yet another broadly played ethnic role.  You're better off seeing him play opposite Peck in the vastly superior ""Guns Of Navarrone.""",1085443200,3,1152,4.891752577319588

Totally unrealistic( as opposed to say Moby Dick)it concentrated on lavish costumes and ornate sets with next to no attention to dialogue or story line. Quinn's character was so obnoxiusely phony and bombastic I thought I was going to be sick, as I love Quinn's work in Barrabas. The phony bravada of almost all the characters was totally unrealistic and made me sick. The ultimate in flowery Hollywood nonesense depending solely on visuals and nothing else.

Hot Toasty Rag, August 10, 2017

I guess every decade has their fair share of stupid movies. In the 1952, The World in His Arms was added to that list. Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn play opposing sea captains, and while Gregory Peck is trying to negotiate a deal to purchase the land of Alaskathis is a period pieceAnn Blythe, a Russian countess, tries to persuade him to sail her and her grandmother to Alaska from San Francisco. Shes engaged to someone else, then engaged to Gregory Peck, then engaged to the first man againit all gets rather confusing, and its not interesting enough to really care about untangling the mess.

Theres a famous boat battle scene from this movie, but I cant imagine anyone in modern audiences finding it exciting. The blue-screen is laughable, but maybe in 1952 audiences were fooled by technology used in the scene. I was almost put to sleep by this movie, and actually groaned at the corniness of the last line of dialogue. Save your time and watch anything else.",1502323200,,1032,4.633879781420765

7863468,5,630415318X,"Lovely Swashbuckling classic, starring Gregory Peck.

Peck plays The Boston Man, a clipper captain, making a living as a seal hunter in Alaska. Minor problem: Alaska isn't american and the activities of The Boston Man is a thorn in the eye of the russian governor. To complicate matters Peck falls head over heels in love with a russian countess - played by Ann Blyth.

She is trying reach Alaska and her uncle, the governor, just two steps ahead of an unwanted fianc and an undesirable marriage, arranged by the Zar himself.

The Boston Man's solution: Crush the competition and buy Alaska.

Also starring Anthony Quinn, as a bit of a pirate and The Boston Man's less succesful seal hunting competition.
