7975288,5,B00007CVSQ,"This movie looks like it was made exclusively to be aired on Cinemax late at night. There are about half a dozen or more explicit sex scenes that border on hardcore. Tiffany Shepis herself is featured in one of them. She plays Nola, a soulful rock singer who joins the Vinyl Dolls but harbors a secret past with her drug dealer boyfriend who also happens to be in town looking for her.
 This is a male fantasy movie where every girl in the band is [easy] but the rock music they play is marginally good at best.",1067385600,12,511,4.268041237113402
