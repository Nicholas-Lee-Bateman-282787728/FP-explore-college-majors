7888688,4,630532025X,"In America, they always try to scare you with horror stories about birth and how ""safe"" an epidural is (even though it is a drug, it does pass through the placenta, and it can cause your baby to be irritable for up to six weeks).  In America, they need to show more videos like this one.  Check out some other great books like Immaculate Deception by Suzanne Arms, and Ina May's Midwifery book.  It truly makes me cry...the things they do to moms and babies in America.",1146614400,,469,4.367816091954023
7888689,3,630532025X,"This is a good ""starter"" video for those who want an in-depth of the ""how's"" of the pregnancy process; but there are better videos out there (see BIRTH DAY).
And for the record, regarding the review which said ""seems to be among the very rare women who are able to give birth without the aid of forceps or an episiotomy."" This is ENTIRELY untrue. Many, many, many women give birth without the aid of forceps or an episiotomy. The reason that they are so often used in this country is that the medical profession rushes the labor process, and doesn't allow a woman's body to do what it needs to do, which negates the need for such medical interventions. Watch Birth Day (or call a doula and ask) if you'd like more information. :)",1081296000,11,729,4.447761194029851
7888690,3,630532025X,"The video was a nice documentary on human conception and birth, with concentration on the female reproductive system.  There are a few graphic shots at the very end of the video, during the actual birth, where ""Phillipa"" seems to be among the very rare women who are able to give birth without the aid of forceps or an episiotomy.  The birth scenes are deceptively quick and painless.  Only about 5 minutes of this video is about birth/delivery, which was rather disappointing.  They do not describe the 3 stages of labor or say how long labor can last, etc..  I also couldn't figure out why they chose a leech and it's host to describe the fetus/mother relationship (yuck).  All in all, this is one of the better videos out there, but I have yet to find one that truly focuses on pregnancy and birth.  This will probably be as close as you can get... If you're expecting your first baby... READ BOOKS instead.",1039392000,10,910,4.580246913580247
7888691,5,630532025X,"This video is VERY graphic, but facinating just the same (not for people with a queasy stomach). As an expecting father, I found the video wonderful for knowing what is going on with my child and wife. I wish there had been  more of the birth, but all of the information about the pregnancy was more  helpful. After all, I'll get to see my child's birth, but I can't see  what's going on inside my wife now! Wonderful information with a good  presentation, especially in terms of the time-lapse photography, inside  shots, and graphics.",951782400,22,536,4.659574468085107
