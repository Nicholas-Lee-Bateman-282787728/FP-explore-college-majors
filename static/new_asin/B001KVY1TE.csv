8316192,5,B001KVY1TE,"If you know Beirut at all, this is a movie that you have to see.  It explores the Lebanese Civil War from the eyes of a teenager - anxious to get away from his French dominated school - and winding up in the midst of the conflict.  You'll witness the stress on his family and his friends.
The actors are able to accurately reflect the character of the Lebanese - and there kindness and generosity in the midst of what became an unholy mess.
It's worth the investment to see the Middle East from the side of its people.",1235260800,4,518,4.222222222222222
