7820023,3,630203518X,"I bought this movie because I'm a Frank Runyeon fan and it's difficult to get anything he's done outside of the soap realms, (which I didn't happen to catch). Yes, I'm probably the only person who didn't catch him on ATWT!

As for the movie, if you don't expect the best storyline or action scenes (or even much sense on occasion), you'll be fine.

Frank does have a nude sex scene in it and it's about all you'll find from one of the most beautiful men in the world.

BTW... last I heard, Frank never got paid for doing this movie!",1283472000,,532,4.247524752475248
7820024,5,630203518X,I remember renting this video in the 1980's at the video store. actor frank runyeon made his feature film debut I was anxious to see it because he was on of my favorite characters on the soap as the world turns. his acting is good and I liked the film very much. It would be nice if they release it on dvd or bluray.,1276473600,,316,3.953125
7820025,4,630203518X,"Sudden Death stars Denise(I'm no)Coward as a innocent victim of a gang rape(if you are a friend of mine you knew where I was going with this)she at first seeks help from the police but alas gets none.  Does she seek help from her friends?  Does she seek psychiatric help??  Does she move to another state???  No she goes and buys a gun!!!  And seeks out the scum with no mercy.  This is a different kind of film then your usual R & R for this has good acting and the rape was not bad(wait! rape is awful what I met to say is it is tone down from say LAST HOUSE and I SPIT)You really root for Denise when she kills men and are happy to see them BLOWN AWAY!!!  As Queen Latifa would say ""YOU GO GIRL""  This seems to be the last thing Denise did which is a shame for she is very good.",1217808000,4,781,3.929936305732484
