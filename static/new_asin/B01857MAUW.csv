7539601,1,B01857MAUW,This is a very amature production. Horrible,1455926400,3,43,5.285714285714286
7539602,1,B01857MAUW,"I purchased this video because I thought it was a video of the song 'all I ask'. that's why it was only $6.99. However when I got it, I realized it was an unauthorized documentary and it was the worst quality I have ever seen in a video. Like somebody already said halfway into the documentary the audio and the visuals went out of sync and about 10 minutes later they went back into sync. The disc menu that tells you the different things that are on the disc was misleading, it did not go to the things it said it went to places within the documentary so when you click on them it looks like you're seeing the same show over and over and over again.  It was very poor quality and I was very disappointed since like others I am a huge massive Adele fan and I know she definitely would have some major issues with this type of thing being sold to her fans. So like the others have said don't waste your money.  I thought the one I had was defective so I contacted Amazon and they sent me another one and the second one did the exact same thing so it's clearly poor workmanship.",1455667200,15,1077,4.148325358851674

7539604,2,B01857MAUW,"I love Adele, but this video is not very good. And the voices don't match with the lips. It has fairly entertaining content. It's a documentary. Maybe it isn't even an authorized documentary.",1455321600,9,191,4.818181818181818

8741498,1,B01857MAUW,Purchased this with the idea that it would be Adele in person in a concert setting or at least music videos... I had no intentions of buying a dvd of s***ty videos put together with robotic voices covering the audio. Highly disappointed.,1468368000,2,237,4.666666666666667

8741501,1,B01857MAUW,"""All I Ask"" is for the few minutes I was able to stomach this awful unauthorized ""documentary"" to be returned back to me. It was ridiculous that in the Biography segment of the disc consisted of a digital voice one might hear from their phone or computer reading off what sounds like a Wikipedia page with a cheap montage of photos of Adele in computer slideshow format. It only gets worse from there. Don't waste your time, not to mention your money!",1463184000,2,451,4.512195121951219
