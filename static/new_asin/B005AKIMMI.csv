We managed to get through all 10 of Shawns intermediate and advanced DVDs in just 2 months, mostly only practicing on Saturdays.  We enjoyed all the videos but especially this advanced volume 2 as they were really able to do exactly what I was hoping for and round out the moves taught in the previous DVDs as well as introduce some really good style tips for leaders and followers plus Shawn exposed some of his secrets to becoming a better leader.  We now have amassed a huge amount of moves for our 2-step quiver and look forward to showcasing them each weekend at our local country dance venue.",1399507200,,691,4.468253968253968
