7209284,2,B00YAZND32,"The film is told with a flashback to a magic act gone bad in 1931. A group of young adults are invited to a party at a magician's house and become locked in. The house is haunted or something, we eventually play 10 little Indians with a group of people that don't get along with each other.

The acting bordered on comical. I think they could have come up with a better soundtrack too. There was a token torso nudity (no face) about in the middle of the film that served no purpose what-so-ever other than to have it in there. Was that supposed to be Mrs. Mesmer?

Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, nudity- thanks whoever you were.  Watch ""Demonic"" 2015 instead.",1446249600,2,654,4.3884297520661155
7209285,1,B00YAZND32,don't have much time or energy to even write a review for this film. Lazy and crappy film making gets a lazy and crappy review. Don't watch this movie it is seriously the worst ever. Nothing fun or redeeming just pure torture that makes no sense. I hate when I spend my movie dollars on horrible crap like this and waste my time. Stay far away movie lovers. This piece of cinephile trash is just plain lousy! I can't wait to forget about this movie forever. Bye Felicia. And bye bye Deaths Door. You were the most awful move I may have ever seen. It made no sense and just sucked.,1445990400,4,580,4.2342342342342345

8717813,1,B00YAZND32,An annoying cast of teenage idiots in a supposedly haunted house. Wish they had killed more of them quicker than they did. Nothing new except the cast. Same old tired plot and the same script written by a 13 year old potty mouth. Ho-hum,1504310400,,236,4.386363636363637
8717814,2,B00YAZND32,"This movie begins in the year 1931.  A magician sets a casket on fire.  The trick backfires and the trapped man screams.  Now the present.  We see two men in a car and a woman putting on make up in front of her mirror.  She calls her friend about a party.  The one man in the car calls someone on the phone while he visits a museum and sees artifacts.  A scary looking black man scares the man away.

When a young man and woman try to walk upstairs of this museum, the same scary black guy waits for them to reach the top of the stairs.  Then he lifts them up by grabbing the top of their heads, making the woman scream.  He drops them to the floor and they leave.  A black and white guy at the party get into a fight and say they want to take it outside but the front door's jammed.  The females of the group argue over... I don't know what.  Silly stuff.  They hear a woman scream in the other room.  Nobody can get out so they begin to panic.  This is the same room where the two guys were about to get into a fight but couldn't due to the jammed door.  3 guys use all their energy to open the door but fall backwards.

The black guy says there's four types of people in this world.  Those who panic in a crisis, those who analyze a crisis but don't do anything and those who exploit a crisis.  And his nerdy friend is in the second category.  The nerdy guy asks the black guy if he's a little bit freaked out but he says he's not.  The group walks around and sees a dead body of a man on the floor beside the stairs.  One guy wonders ""Who'd bring a dead guy in the house!"" but the other guy says it doesn't have a smell so perhaps it's fake.  Just then the scary looking black dude picks up the dead body and carries it away.

The one girl tries to get a phone signal as the group walks around.  They find themselves walking alone.  The one girl sees a shadow on the wall and screams.  The blonde woman and nerdy guy walk together.  As she twists a doorknob he says, after having tried the door himself, ""Don't listen to the guy with the glasses- I only tried it a thousand times Goldilocks!""  The black guy opens the bathroom door and we see a woman tied to a chair surrounded by rats and blood.  Wow, when the one girl panics her friend smacks the heck out of her!  I'm pretty sure I'd calm down too after being smacked that hard.

Soon enough everyone sits around waiting.  Except for Goldilocks.  She's a persistent one.  She tries all the doors.  Someone in the house keeps flipping over an hourglass.  The bathroom lights go off when the one guy from the group takes a leak.  When the lights turn on there's blood in the toilet.  He sneaks out of the room and sees a guillotine chair.  He foolishly puts his head inside of it and something immediately chops him from behind while he sees a head fall on the floor in front of him.  The group all walk to the guillotine.  The black guy insists nothing will happen when the blade comes down.  ""It's just a trick for crying out loud!""

The group relax in another room as a guy and gal get a little frisky if you catch my drift.  The nearby fireplace will keep their nude bodies warm!  Thee nerdy guy says he's had enough.  The black guy says ""I know, you're not used to this much excitement!""  The black guy then trips with blood on his shirt.  He tastes the blood and says it's animal blood- not human blood.  They look at a casket that is meant to bury people alive.  It's part of the prop.  The black guy accuses the guy he almost got into a fight with earlier of killing the other friend in the group.  They accidentally knock out the nerdy guy when he gets caught in between.

Suddenly the dinner bell rings and the one woman of the group freaks out that someone is inside the locked casket right next to them.  The nerdy guy grabs a sharp object but the black guy tells him that's a bad idea because he'd stab the person inside.  ""Just think for once!""  They get the casket open and an attractive lady pops out.  She says she was asleep and doesn't know how she got there.  The black guy insists it's magic.  She remembers a shadow, opens her eyes and sees a black man standing there looking straight at her.  She saw the man fling a gigantic blade.  She tried to scream but couldn't as the blade kept hitting her.

The black guy still thinks this is all a joke but the girl in the casket isn't laughing.  Just then that scary black man from earlier appears in the room.  He grabs one teen by the throat and pushes him into the wall.  He runs after another girl with his hand sticking out ready to grab.  We hear a magician say his greatest trick is to steal time from all his enemies.  We see ghosts walking down the stairs and across rooms.  It's just a dream from the one girl who passed out.  She wakes up and her boyfriend says he did a terrible thing and didn't mean to.  She asks where he went and the boyfriend says he just left her for a little while.  He promises to never do that again.  I guess he cheated on his girlfriend?  He promises he'll do whatever it takes to get them out of here.

A girl sitting on the toilet tries to use her phone but sees weird images on her screen.  The black guy insists what's going on here is a huge trick.  Just then the sound of nails hammering into a bookcase consumes the teens hearing so they cover their ears.  The girl in the casket says ""I can't understand why all this is happening!""  The others say ""There has to be a reason for this"" and ""Why would anyone do this to us!""  The black guy questions why the casket girl didn't cover her ears.

One of the teens heads to the basement.  Another teen catches him by surprise.  They look over the old cobweb-y items used for magic that have been kept down here since forever.  The casket girl sees a shadow of a man walk up the stairs but... it's the black guy from the group, not the super scary black guy. :)  The black guy pretends his hand's stuck in the wall which makes the girls scream.  He finds the deeds to this house in the wall.  The news articles they find show pictures of the magician who used to live here.  Back to the year 1931 we see the magician's wife say ""I don't want to do this!"" before smacking him.  The scary black guy was apparently around back in 1931.  He claps his hands to congratulate them on a trick... the magician just performed with his wife?  Who knows!

The one girl panics when she becomes covered in spider webs.  Upstairs in the bathroom the one girl screams when she sees a pair of legs in the bathtub.  The black guy insists they aren't real legs and nothing we see in the house is real.  ""How do you know?"" says the one teen and the black guy replies ""Is anyone dead?""  The teens want the black guy to prove it by picking up the legs.  He licks the blood off the legs and spits it out.  He's still not convinced.  The nerdy guy says ""Just shut up man!  Look at the facts around you!""  You know so far it really does seem like a big prank is going on here.  The ending and the 30 minute leading up to it doesn't indicate a prank though.

The casket girl and nerdy guy lay down together after he's able to make her laugh.  They start to make out.  The group questions what's going on.  The one guy in the group questions the black guy when he said something about ""Having it all figured out"" and they want to know what he meant by that line.  The black guy refuses to answer on grounds of ""Freedom of speech"".  The one guy says ""Speak freely!""  The black guy says ""One minute you want to kick my butt for not shutting up.  Now you want to kick it for not spilling my guts"".  He says he made it up and doesn't know anything.  The one guy points a gun at the black guy's head.  He tries to grab the gun but is shot.  The shooter defends himself by saying ""I just wanted to scare him"".

Now the group questions if the black guy was right and they just killed an innocent man.  The one girl says there's something wrong with this house, and the blonde haired girl says she's getting out of here no matter what it takes.  The group protects the shooter.  The shooter says ""I didn't kill anyone did you forget?"" when confronted for his actions by another man in the group.  The nerdy guy kills casket girl... I guess.  We only see quick images passing by and never actually see her body.  The rest of the group freaks out over her death.  The nerdy guy is slapped by another guy in the group as the girls scream more.  The group returns to the bathtub where the girl's leg are lying there scrumptiously.  The one guy says to look over the book of the family tree to try and find any information about those who once lived in the house and figure out if anything looks out of place.  *****

We flash back to 1931 again as the magician goes through with his act that involves tying a black magician around chains and nailing him inside a casket to see if he can free himself.  But that's not all- the magician also lights the casket on fire.  In present time the one guy from the group sees the prop of the dead guy that we saw early on in the movie.  You know, the dead guy lying by the stairs.  A girl is trapped nearby and is freed.  They look over the names in the book.  One guy recalls his mother's name.  The reason for the killings in the house and the reason everyone's trapped is to make them all pay for revenge since these teens are all descendants of their mothers and fathers.  Back to 1931 the trapped black magician has trouble escaping his casket.  He gets caught on fire and, while he's able to be set free, he soon dies.  He swears revenge on those responsible as he burns to death.  The one woman he swears revenge on must've been the mother of the blonde girl in the group since, shifting back to the present, she screams an apology.

The lights go off and turn back on as the blonde girl says ""He killed me.  He killed us both.  He bound us both in chairs and sat us across from one another.  We were naked with only a gun in our hands.  He sat rats on us so we'd have to get eaten alive or we'd kill one another before they had gotten to us.  We thought he was dead.  We thought he couldn't get to us.  But he got to us anyways.  His reach is too powerful.  It could come up from out of a grave.  He's not going to let you get away.  He's coming for you next.  He's not going to get tired.  He'll never forgive you.  His hate is unstoppable and he never takes rest"".

The blonde girl points a gun at the nerdy guy and says ""He's not who you think he is"".  The nerdy guy says ""I just want to use the gun- you're the one with the gun"".  The nerdy guy adds ""I'm not going to let him come here and kill us.  I'm with you guys!""  When he turns around the blonde woman shoots him.  He was trying to open the door which would let in the revenge sworn magician from 1931.  The door opens anyway and quickly gets kicked shut by someone in the group.

The blonde girl says she's not going to let him get her.  She then exits through the door.  One guy questions if the blonde woman is a reincarnation of the magician's wife.  The door opens and the blonde woman walks back in.  She says she saw someone named Jumbo and he wonders what took him so long.  The blonde woman insists it's not a trick and to check for themselves.  The one woman wants to go but her boyfriend stops her.  She says she's pregnant and they kiss.  Suddenly he smacks his girlfriend hard across the face for no reason.  The group walks down the hallway where the scary black guy is.  They follow him to a gate and enter.  He takes the teens behind a gate and tries to trap them there, but they free themselves.  They run away as the scary black dude watches them.  They open a casket lid and see the blonde woman.  They open another casket and see their other friend.

We now reach the end and find out what happened to these teens.  The black teen was removed from the living room.  Another guy was pulled from beneath the elevator door.  He was the guy who smacked his girlfriend.  Another one was riddled with hundreds of coffin nails.  The family of one of the girls protects their rights to reveal anything about her.  Another girl was taken from the floor of the guest room shower.  The casket girl was removed from the upstairs bedroom and her severed legs from the bathroom.  The blonde girl had all her bones broken.  I enjoy the credits theme afterwards.  The riff at least.

I was about to give Death's Door a higher rating but the final 30 minutes became *really* confusing.  I have no idea what happened other than the magician's wife was killed back in 1931, the blonde haired girl is apparently the descendant of the wife (or the wife itself reincarnated) and the black magician who was burned alive in the casket seeks revenge on the blonde woman because she's a descendant of the magician's wife.  Besides that the characters aren't really introduced properly and are just thrown out there, and the only reason they eventually become memorable is because they stick together long enough while walking through the rooms and hallways trying to find a way out.  They're slightly more memorable while trying to figure out how they've become trapped/who is trapping them.  The story has this way of being somewhat boring and cliched, and the deaths aren't anything to write home about either.  The story's pretty messy and jumps around a lot.",1501891200,,13337,4.2042755344418055

And indeed, the premise is that several young people are trapped in a house with someone - or something - that will kill them off one by one. That theme has been done to death, and while I am not opposed to watching yet another haunted house film, this film adds nothing new to the genre. The acting, writing, cinematography, and special effects were not executed terribly well. All things considered, I didn't like this film.",1463616000,3,576,4.495238095238095

8717822,2,B00YAZND32,"Deaths Door was a movie that Im afraid reminds me in a bad way of late 90s and early 2000s horror.

We see a cast of folks unlucky and unlikable folks trapped in a place where they are seeing some very scary things, including bad CGI. They walk around, they fight amongst themselves, and then finally things start happening if you are still hanging around at that point to see it for yourself. Tommy Tiny Lister does have a role here, as does Obba Babatund. I don't mind them at all here, but they just aren't enough to save this one. They aren't even in the movie as much as others, but those other names don't seem to even be listed on the IMDB page of the film, which leads you to question how proud they or someone even of the cast the movie has.

Tommy Tiny Lister (The Dark Knight) stars with Obba Babatunde (The Silence of the Lambs) in this suspenseful tale of murder, magic, and revenge. It all begins with an anonymous text inviting a dozen people to a party. The young men and women gather, eat, drink, and have the time of their lives inside the doors of a dilapidated mansion. That is, until its time to go. The front door doesnt open. The back door doesnt open. Doors that once led to familiar rooms now lead to new ones. Some doors open to yet other doors, and some go straight to dead ends. Only one thing is constant: Every door is a trap, and theres only one way out.

I don't know where to start with this one when talking about what I didn't like about it. The CGI can be overlooked because of the budget Im sure it had, but they really used it in silly ways on top of just using it in general here. Im not even sure they use Tiny Lister here as well as they should have. Yeah, the man is a mean looking person overall, but he has charisma and this movie sure could have used some of that to be mixed in here to help breathe a bit more life into it. I know horror isn't all about blood and nudity, but this one sure needed some of that or something to spice things up. Good stuff is teased, but it just never does happen and when it this one ends you are waiting for it to end. It is a hard finish anyway, but you just find yourself trying to push through and it comes with very little reward when you do finish it.",1449705600,2,3893,4.323287671232877
