Her interpretation of the Elgar Concerto will go unmatched for this century and  more to come.  The cello, an extension in her body...as she cradles it and  fills it with emotion.  Elgar himself might  have been moved to tears by  the end of the performance...his masterpiece has found its finest  interpretaion.  Jackie was not only talented, but beautiful and a  down-to-earth person.  Had she lived, she'd be the premiere cellist of the  world over.  HOwever, her recordins with transcend time and continue to  dazzle/bewilder  listeners from coast to coast.  How at such a young age,  any person could have such complete understanding of music.  An icon.",949190400,11,791,5.0
