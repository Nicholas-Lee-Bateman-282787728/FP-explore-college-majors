5666772,4,B00BQNSJZS,"Arcadia takes you through classic road movie fare centering on the coming of age of a young girl struggling to understand her crumbling family.  The further out she travels, driven by her father and accompanied by her older sister and younger brother, the less events are shielded by the simplicity of her childhood and the more you are compelled by Ryan Simpkins' young character in her efforts to understand the secrets that lie beneath her family's dynamic and her own maturing evolution.  The plot may be predictable but as with road trips it's what's in the journey not the destination, and what Arcadia offers lies in its actors' performances and their drawing power as the story plays itself through.",1373328000,,707,4.932773109243698
5666773,5,B00BQNSJZS,"Olivia Silver cautiously expanded her prize winning short film `Little Canyon' into a meticulously crafted full length film, changed the name to ARCADIA , and found a fine cast to direct for this ensemble work. It is sensitively written, directed and acted and should become a cult film for those who love quiet meaningful dramas.

In a New England town Tom (John Hawkes, so brilliant as the quadriplegic virgin in `The Sessions') is gathering his three young children - Caroline (Kendall Toole) Greta (Ryan Simpkins0 and Nat (Ty Simpkins) - into his station wagon to move to California: he has been out of work for six months and landed a job in Arcadia, California. His wife is not joining them on the trip but Tom assures the children she will join them in California. Each of the three children must leave behind something important to them and each takes with them the hope that things will be better in California. Tom does not tell them truthfully why their mother is not with them on the trip - that truth comes out at the end of the film. Caroline handles the concept of the move best, though she leaves behind her boyfriend. Greta is the one who is in that zone of changing from girl to woman: she still carries her toy bunny and her box of photos with her, and on the trip she enters the terrors of puberal changes. Nat is encased in the innocence of childhood and that state is threatened at several points during the trip. The interaction of this four-member family is tense but there is an underlying love that shines through, even though Tom's manner of being both father and mother is not without flaws. ARCADIA is a true coming of age story for all four characters and the sensitivity each of these fine actors brings to the story is magical.

In a time when movies are so concentrated on potty mouth guy films and gal films or shoveling expensive special effects mega pictures to predict the end of mankind, ARCADIA glows with intelligence and finesse. It is quietly one of the finest films of the year. Grady Harp, July 13",1373328000,8,2041,4.573770491803279
5666774,5,B00BQNSJZS,"Arcadia is a touching coming-of-age tale with amazing performances.  John Hawkes is at his best.  Beautifully shot, the film takes you through the most scenic routes of America.  I loved it.  Definitely check it out!",1371427200,,216,5.085714285714285
5666775,4,B00BQNSJZS,"ARCADIA is a small film about coming of age in a broken family.  That could describe any number of films out of Sundance or other indie friendly fests in a given year.  Arcadia rises above the rest.  The emotions on display are handled with a sensitivity not often found outside of literature.  The film handles this coming of age so well, portrays it so accurately that it was given a special award at the berlin film festival, by a jury of kids.  They voted this film the one the most represented what it felt like to be a kid, right now.

John Hawkes is a genius and he gives a taught performance as the dad who is struggling keeping his family together by the barest of threads.  He isn't a geeat dad, and Hawkes seems to know this, and have the character apologize for this sad fact even with his body language.  It should have won an award.

Ryan Simpkins is the girl who the film focuses on, and she is fantastic.

Rent it, buy it, stream it, whatever.  See it.

5666817,4,B00BQNSJZS,"When Tom (John Hawkes) bundles his three children, Caroline (Kendall Toole), Greta (Ryan Elise Simpkins) and Nat (Ty Simpkins) into his car at the break of day, for a three thousand mile road journey to Arcadia, Los Angeles, California, he is promising them a new life and a bright tomorrow.  After being unemployed he has finally managed to find a job in Arcadia and needs the family to relocate.  Mum is noticeable by her absence, but Tom tells the children she will be following later.

There are tensions on the journey and Tom is clearly on edge, as he fights with another motorist and shows other signs of being under pressure, including, at one stage, leaving Greta on a deserted road in the middle of nowhere.  Meanwhile doubts begin to creep in as to what has happened to Mother since she appears to be uncontactable by phone, and Tom's explanations seem increasingly doubtful to the children.

John Hawkes and Ryan Simpkins put in masterful performances and in truth the main action is in the relationship between these two.  As far as Greta is concerned this is a coming of age movie, exemplified symbolically in Walnut Canyon, as her stuff toy is discarded.  The other two main characters are really in supporting roles, but both also deliver very adequate performances.

This is not a fast moving film, but it is very well filmed and the pace is very measured.  The end is not the strongest aspect, but it does tie things up neatly.",1379203200,,1445,4.7023809523809526
5666818,3,B00BQNSJZS,"Well acted and a naturalistic, somewhat believable, script telling how a separated father is caring for his young son and two teen daughters as they drive across the country (East coast to West Coast) for his new job. Supposedly the mom, whom the kids having not seen for most or their lives, is waiting for them. The usual dad vs. kids disagreements appear although in this case dad seems overly heavy handed at times making you question his character. That is one hole that needed to be filled - understanding him. The major hole is that we never see the story from the mom's pov, only from this questionable dad, so we are left with a one-sided storytelling. Final hole is no resolution and since we are 90 minute prisoners of someone's else's tale it would be nice to leave it finished - unless they plan a sequel.",1378857600,,818,4.533783783783784
5666819,5,B00BQNSJZS,"This is a little movie about a family's cross country trip to a new home, but without Mom.  As is almost always the case, John Hawkes' acting is persuasive and amazing.  He always becomes the character he plays and this one is  conflicted but resolute in his belief that he is doing the right thing and that nothing else matters.  The young actress playing Greta is also wonderfully heartbreaking in this role.  Made me think, and made me a bit sad and a bit happy.",1377734400,2,465,4.423529411764706

Greta does not see the need to move cross country and butts heads with father on many occasions. Greta does not understand why her mother is not along for the move. Tom tries to protect Greta from the sad truth about her mother and why she could not come along with them.

5666822,4,B00BQNSJZS,"John Hawkes plays Tom, a man with a new job in Arcadia, California. He takes his children from their beds in the middle of the night and leaves with them on a road trip cross-country to their new destination. He tells them that their mother will be meeting them in California. However, as the road trip progresses, things are not quite as they seem. Tom has an anger problem and is not very straight shooting with his three children. Greta, the twelve year old, is the person with whom we identify most. In a sense, it is through her eyes that we see this movie unfold. She is on the cusp of adolescence and is leaving her childhood behind with every mile that they travel. She counters her dad's comments and it is with her that he gets most angry.

The movie is a steady progress of the life of this family as they move together and apart and then together again. Truth becomes unmasked and forgiveness becomes a viable way to negotiate changes. The movie moves slowly but steadily to fruition in both a melodic and dystonic manner. Overall, I enjoyed it very much. I received a copy for review purposes and appreciate the opportunity to have viewed this movie.",1375228800,3,1163,4.511848341232228
5666823,3,B00BQNSJZS,"This is an interesting film, if not a bit mysterious, since the viewer is not given all the answers. We have a father, two daughters and a son traveling to California, but the mother is missing. He tells them mom will soon be with them, but somehow we know that is not going to happen.

Even with the excellent acting it is hard to relate or even sympathize with the characters, especially with no real addition to the storyline.
The acting is superb by everyone. What is missing is a soundtrack that is even. At points when the actors are talking softly it is hard to discern everything that they are saying which makes one feel they are missing out on part of the plot. There are no subtitles to help out with this problem either.

There is an interesting bonus 20 minute film that is the basis for which the longer movie was created. . There are also bios of the director and actors and a movie trailer.

5666826,4,B00BQNSJZS,"Tom has been unemployed for some time, when he decides to pack his three kids up in his old station wagon and drive to Arcadia in California, where he says he has the best offer ever for a job. This entails a 2,800 mile road trip from New England. First off they leave the dog; he tells the kids that their mom will bring him when she comes.

His eldest daughter Caroline is more upset about leaving her boyfriend behind, Greta who is twelve is having the worst time, questioning everything and having a constant refrain of `when will mom join us'. Little nine year old Nat is just full of verve and seemingly enjoying the adventure with a special promise of seeing the grand Canyon. It is clear that Tom is having problems, with furtive calls on the phone and mood swings that serious anger management might be needed to address. The scenery changes and the atmosphere gets ever charged as pieces of the puzzle that Greta is trying to figure out, start to make themselves tangible through glimpses of evidence and overheard conversation, and still the road goes on.

This is a beautifully simple tale on first glance, then the layers start to get pulled back and you realise that a quietly moving story is developing and that the deep emotion involved with families runs very deep indeed. Director Olivia Silver has made a very moving and engaging film, which is based on her 20 minute short film `Little Canyon' which is also included on this disc. The performances from all are excellent especially John Hawkes as Tom (`Lincoln' and `American Gangster') he comes across as completely believable despite his sometimes erratic and borderline violent behaviour. The kids are great too Ty Simpkins as Nat is terrific as indeed is Ryan Simpkins who at the age of 14 is too talented by half and can only get better with age, I hope.

With a run time of 91 minutes, it is both well balanced and paced, sometimes when a short is made into a feature it can seem to be a bit laboured, but thankfully not in this case as the story has been broadened and embellished, but in a rather good way. Quick mention of the cinematography, which is actually excellent but understated - you only notice the nice touches on subsequent viewing, which is always appreciated. I received a copy for review purposes for which I am grateful as this is a wonderfully accomplished film that I can only recommend.",1374883200,,2384,4.617924528301887
5666827,5,B00BQNSJZS,"Arcadia is a movie to watch! It starts off with the dad (John Hawkes) telling his three children to get in the car for their trip to California. You don't really know the reason behind the trip at first, but you are ready to go along with the journey. I really liked the struggle between the father and the children. It shows how each family has their ups and downs but no matter what you come out the other side. I don't think the film focused too much on the fact that the mother was not in the picture, but rather on the dynamic of the existing family members. The movie really focused on Greta and how she grew in the trip. There were a lot of changes for her and she had to accept many new situations. Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie to watch and to buy. It is simply a movie to relax to and again just go with the journey.",1374883200,,845,4.127272727272727
5666828,4,B00BQNSJZS,"Arcadia is quietly amazing. We get so used to the fast paced, punch-line filled movies from the big studios that it is such a pleasure to watch a movie that just 'is'.

Arcadia is a soft spoken movie about a family (minus mom) driving over 3,000 miles in a beat up and over packed station wagon (with the crock pot precariously balanced between the two kids in the back seat) to their new home and life in Arcadia, California. They leave a bunch of belongings behind with the premise that mom will be joining them soon. We never see mom and she never answers the phone. About halfway through I started to realize that something was not right with dad's story.

Tom (dad) is doing his best, and often failing, at keeping his three kids happy and excited about their new adventures. He is often behind the scenes arguing and the true picture of their family's troubles slowly comes out.

Twelve-year-old Greta is charming, beautiful and commands the screen. Her older sister and younger brother are the perfect compliment to the family dynamic. Throughout their 3,000 mile journey, the kids change, grow up, and realize that what once was important no longer is. Tom does the best he can keeping it all together and you come to like him more and more as the movie progresses.

This is like watching any American family trek across the country. The lines are real, the situations real, nothing is perfect and nothing seems scripted.

A great movie, beautifully shot and acted.",1374710400,,1473,4.6937984496124034
5666829,4,B00BQNSJZS,"I was immediately worried about Harrison, the stuffed rabbit that 12-year-old Greta (Ryan Simpkins) constantly carries around when we meet her at the start of writer-director Olivia Silver's ""Arcadia.""  In the opening minute of this 2013 film it becomes clear that Greta is the focal character, that her stuffed animal is a symbol of her youthful innocence, and that whatever is about to happen, it is not going to be good.  Early one morning her father loads Greta, her older sister and young brother, plus all their wordly possessions, into a dented blue station wagon to drive across the country to California, a new job, and a new life, one in which he promises their absent mother will be joining them.  This sounds like a good thing, but the father's words ring hollow, because Silver is providing subtle clues that create a sense of unease.  Plus, the whole idea of a family driving to the promised land in California reminds me of the Joads in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grapes-of-Wrath/dp/B0000DJZ8R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grapes of Wrath</a>,"" and we all remember how well that worked out.

As Tom, the father, John Hawkes is able to make the mercurical changes from being charming to being on the verge of exploding, similar to what he did in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martha-Marcy-May-Marlene/dp/B006Z7XNVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martha Marcy May Marlene</a>.""  Such characters are well established creatures, but Hawkes is able to pull off both parts of the equation well enough, especially the charming part, that for once I am willing to indulge in the possibility that there might actually be some good in him.  But his constant explosions over everything from the amount of wine in his glass to the cost for visiting the Grand Canyon make both us and Greta wary.

There is sort of Goldilocks and the Three Bears subtext to the interaction between Tom and his kids as he tries to weave his magic.  For Caroline (Kendall Toole) his constant stories and perpetual promises are too little and for Greta they becoming too much and more so by the minute and the mile, while for Nat (Ty Simpkins, Ryan's brother), the youngest and who eats up each and every syllable Dad utters, they are just right.  Greta is the middle child, not just in terms of age, but in terms of making the transition from the innocence of youth represented by Nat to the already world weary Caroiline.

Ryan Simpkins has over a dozen film credits on her resume already (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gardens-of-the-Night/dp/B0020EHE8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gardens of the Night</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherry-Baby/dp/B0018ZCWC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherry Baby</a>,""
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Road/dp/B002DJROQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Road</a>),"" which matters because this movie hinges on her performance as Greta.  I would not be surprised if she has the least amount of dialogue of any of the four family members in that station wagon, because Silver's approach in this film is to show rather than tell, which requires Simpkins to say little but observe much.  We, as the audience, invest her silent looks with significance, but both the character and her creator are loath to provide too many details as to what she is actually thinking, although her absent mother is a major part of the equation, especially as every mile driven seems to be lengthening rather than shortening the distance between them.  Simpkins' performance is on a par with those in her age group that have been nominated for Oscars, such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whale-Rider/dp/B000SOZXJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whale Rider</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beasts-Of-The-Southern-Wild/dp/B00A7JKMA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beasts Of The Southern Wild</a>,"" where the ability to deliver a line takes a secondary importance to being able to evoke authentic feelings in the audience.

What is clear, is that Greta is growing up and that when she gets out of that station wagon in California she will not be the same girl who began that trip.  As you might suspect, her personal Rubicon comes in the latter part of the journey, and involves Harrison.  Silver is able to do much more with the symbolism of that rabbit with that one moment, with which she is able to offer up the sort of lyrical grace note you want to have in a story where you have such great sympathy for a young girl growing up faster than she should have to.

The DVD includes ""Little Canyon,"" the 20 minute short by Silver that was her thesis film and the basis for ""Arcadia.""  My recommendation is to watch this after you see the movie because I think it is more interesting to go back and see the basis for the movie and to consider in retrospect the way Silver fleshed out the narrative and went beyond the original ending, rather than constantly being aware of all that has been added.  Either way, what you will find is that Silver preserves the lyrical essence of the original.

The genesis of these films was an assignment Silver's first year of graduate film school at UCLA where she was asked to sit down and write the first dream or memory that came to mind, and she wrote down a memory of arriving in California after a five day cross-country trip in the family's run-down station wagon.  The importance of memory is established at the start of ""Arcadia,"" and our sympathy for Greta is such that we hope by the time we get to the final credits that she will have some good memories of her family or the trip or just something in her life.

This is an engaging first film, a rough little gem with some nicely polished moments.  This speaks well for Silver's future as a filmmaker, because the history of Hollywood seems to clearly indicate that it is better to establish a foundation upon which to build rather to go super nova with your first effort and have a slim chance of going in any other direction than down.",1374451200,,6241,5.416924664602683

5666831,4,B00BQNSJZS,"This is director Olivia Silver's debut feature film. Silver produced a short film for her thesis based on a memory from her own childhood - pulling into her family driveway after a cross country road trip.

 In Arcadia, Tom wakes his three children very early and piles them into the family station wagon, to start their journey from New England to California. Tom has accepted a new job after being jobless for over six months. They seem ill prepared as they head out, with packing still being thrown together in the last few minutes. Twelve year old Greta grabs her stuffed bunny Harrison and her memory box. Nine year old Nat is doted upon and very attached to Greta. Caroline is older and sits up front with Dad, navigating and talking on the phone. What's missing? Mom. But, Tom promises, Mom will be joining them soon.

 Right from the beginning, we get a sense that something is 'off'. As the journey progresses, Greta continues to question where their mother is and why they can't reach her. Tom keeps deflecting the questions and tries to jolly the kids along, telling stories, making promises and talking about their new house. But the more he tries to pretend nothing is wrong, the worse things get.

 Academy Award nominee John Hawkes's portrayal of  Tom was excellent. Despite his upbeat mood, there is an underlying sense of danger and the feeling that Tom is only barely holding things together. There are several disturbing scenes where he 'loses' it. What is lost is innocence - that of Greta. This trip is a coming of age for her as childhood is left behind and she is forced to confront many truths about her family. Ryan Simpkins was phenomenal and stole the show for me. Nat was played by her brother Ty Simpkins, making the ties between them even more believable.

 I'm sure if I looked closely at the cars, I could put a year on the movie. But I didn't - and I couldn't. The station wagon brought back my own memories of family road trips. Scenes shot from inside the car looking out at the scenery captured the 'real' feeling of the film. Sepia tones, washed out landscapes and tired buildings all echoed the run down, worn out sense that surrounds Tom.

 Silver cleverly manipulates our emotions and then surprised me at the end with a turn I didn't see coming. An excellent story and an unforgiving look at family - and the ties that bind.",1374192000,,2365,4.607142857142857
5666832,5,B00BQNSJZS,"The promotion materials for Arcadia centers around the presence of John Hawkes. Hawkes, who has been working in film since the late 80's, seems to be finally getting his due lately: his turns in Winter's Bone, The Sessions, and Martha Marcy May Marlene have all made really good movies great ones. Here, he's turning in good work again as an imperfect, defensive father doing his best to keep his children sane as they move to California.

Arcadia centers around a father and his three children (two daughters, and a son) as they travel to the eponymous town on the west coast. By and large, the film is a coming of age story wrapped in a family road-trip plot. It's a small budget indie film, but it never feels like aspects of the movie were hindered for the sake of the budget. What matters here is the characters - how they develop across this 3,000 mile road trip and how they interact with one another. There are few diversions along the way, but they serve more as ways to examine how the father-children dynamic working throughout the road trip.

Aside from Hawkes, the performances of the children are really quite good. The youngest child, Nat (played by the excellent Ty Simpkins), has some particularly precocious things to say, but the writing and the performance never lets his interactions come across as trite, contrived, or too on-the-nose. The daughters are good too: Ryan Simpkins' moody teenager never comes across as too angry or unsympathetic, and Kendall Toole plays well as eldest child although she never gets the screen time/lines she deserves.

As a debut (Olivia Silver as writer and director), Arcadia is very tastefully crafted and confident. The story here is simple, and it is well paced and shot. The gritty, handheld camera work is reminiscent of Martha Marcy May Marlene, and it serves to make the film's setting look bleak and timeless. Information is divulged slowly throughout the movie, and doing so slowly changes the way characters are seen. The movie gets better as it goes on, and it earns real pathos in its final moments.

The best parts of Arcadia come from the small details: the middle daughter, in one letter to her mother writes ""no big arguments"", although you have to look to see it; the father goes behind his daughters and locks their car doors when exiting; Caroline quickly ordering meatloaf at a restaurant (the same meal her father orders). The story easily works as a whole, but what makes this movie worth seeing is its performances and its attention to detail. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in independent cinema or anyone who enjoys character studies.

DVD extras:
Arcadia comes with a few nice bonuses: biographies of the main cast, a trailer of the movie, and the short film on which the feature is based. The short film, Little Canyon, is more or less a condensed version of Arcadia. Although the cast (with the exception of Toole) is different, many of the shots and dialog are recreated in the feature-length version.",1373760000,,3003,4.812015503875969
5666833,4,B00BQNSJZS,"To quickly categorize ""Arcadia"" as a either a ""road movie"" or a coming of age story means falling short of the richly textured examination it offers of a family in crisis.

The movie opens with father Tom loading his three kids (9-year old son Nat and two older sisters: 12-year old Greta and late teen Caroline) for a trip in an aging station wagon from the east coast to Arcadia, California. Left behind is their dog and the family's mom. Mom is promised to join them later. The absence of mom becomes a major piece of tension in the movie, and other dogs will appear along the way as reminders of what they have left behind.

Tom is variously philosophical, angry and irrational as he deals with a vague job offer, and intermittently lashes out at his kids, telephone callers, a waitress, en route family friends and a park ranger on their way west. While the children's portion of this story is centered on middle child Greta, each of the three kids face unhappy, revealing and necessary truths about themselves, their parents and their lives during this trip.

""Arcadia"" offers plenty of ambiguity about the state of Tom's professional and marital, and parental competence as he moves his kids west on the cheap.

Any further discussion of plot details could jeopardize enjoyment of this bittersweet story. As with the best books and movies, things and people aren't often what they seem, and sometimes the way they change can surprise us.

This movie is subtle and understated. The road memes are awesomely portrayed, the characters are rich and believable. Olivia Silver has delivered a little low budget magic here as she unpeels layers of disappointment and discovery.

5666835,4,B00BQNSJZS,"This family road movie is more about the journey than the destination. Filled with amazing actors and a subtly moving plot, 'Arcadia' is one step ahead of most independent films.

Tom (Academy Award nominated actor John Hawkes; ""The Sessions"", ""Winter's Bone"") plays the father who abruptly gathers his three children into an old station wagon to travel from New England to Arcadia, California.

Tom has a new job and Mom won't be joining them until later, adding to the mystery. Eldest sister, Caroline (Kendall Toole in a breakout performance) is joined by moody, middle daughter Greta (played with explosive calmness by Ryan Simpkins - (""Revolutionary Road"" and ""Surveillance"", which gave her a Best Actress award at the NYC Film Festival - the first child to ever win). The youngest member of the family is Ty Simpkins (""Iron Man 3"" and Ryan's real little brother).

The journey is full of Tom filling the time exalting an assortment of wild stories, assurances and a great new life. Caroline is slightly removed, having just left her boyfriend behind. Greta is a quietly smoldering pre-teen having her own personal issues and Nat is the young innocent observer. Tom's moods are unexplainable and disturbing, frequently trapping his three children in dangerous and confusing situations.

Although a low budget film that doesn't make an effort to make the cross country scenery seem like anything other than southern California, it focuses on a strong and sophisticated plot.

Director Olivia Silver does a wonderfully balanced and painful job of story-telling. She presents each family member collectively and individually, reacting to sometimes frightening and all too real situations. As an American family situation, this portrayal suggests it is all too common. This film was supplied by Film Movement for review.",1373414400,3,1821,5.243986254295533
