You can't beat the price, and a number of the discs have the original extras as well. Hard to go wrong with this package.

8573713,4,B00BTJYKAW,"If you're starting a collection of classic movies on DVD or just want to revisit some of your favorites, you really can't go wrong with the 20-film ""Best of"" sets from Warner Bros. Released to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the studio's founding, they span the gamut from early to modern, from musical to thriller, and from comedy to romance. The boxes feature many of Hollywood's greatest stars and are offered at relatively low cost. Housed in three plastic cases within a glossy paperboard box, they come with a booklet containing a photo and a brief synopsis for each film. Most of the discs offer commentaries by historians and participants, or making-of featurettes, or additional scenes and outtakes.

This volume focuses on comedy, which is admittedly a tricky thing (on his deathbed in 1833, the English actor Edmund Kean is said to have uttered the immortal bon mot ""Dying is easy; comedy is hard""). Because it's so subjective and personal, what strikes some as hysterical falls flat for others. Yet a majority of these films have stood the test of time for audiences of all kinds.

We begin with the Marx Brothers romp ""A Night At The Opera"" from 1935. Two classic Cary Grant-Katherine Hepburn pairings, ""Bringing Up Baby"" (1938) and ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), are included along with ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944), another Grant vehicle. The directors of these movies, Howard Hawks, George Cukor, and Frank Capra, are legendary.

Warner's next period of great comedy kicked off in 1974 with ""Blazing Saddles,"" Mel Brooks' spoof of the western genre. Many film buff's recall ""The In-Laws"" (1979), a sly gem starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, with much affection, while ""Caddyshack"" (1980), was a broad laugh-fest featuring Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, and Ted Knight. ""Risky Business"" (1983) launched Tom Cruise's career, just as ""Beetlejuice"" (1988) made Michael Keaton a Hollywood A-lister. Likewise, ""Ace Ventura, Pet Detective"" (1994) gave Jim Carrey his first leading role, establishing his goofy persona.

Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal put together a mobster and a shrink for ""Analyze This,"" hitting comedy paydirt in 1999. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson proved a winning combination in the raunchy ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005), aided and abetted by the brilliant Christopher Walken and other top talent, including Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, Jane Seymour, and Bradley Cooper. In ""The Hangover"" (2009), Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis were joined by Heather Graham, Ken Jeong, and boxer Mike Tyson for what I can only describe as completely over-the-top weirdness and vulgarity.

These films are so diverse that you can be sure not all of them will match your tastes. For example, I've always found ""The Long Long Trailer"" inane and ""The Goonies"" juvenile, but on balance this set is great entertainment at a very reasonable price. Recommended!",1387411200,22,2895,5.177350427350428
