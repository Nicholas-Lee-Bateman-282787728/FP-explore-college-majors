8603991,4,B00ECVPOL8,Was introduced to this at an animation film festival. Wanted to give it another watch I was so entertained by it. Like the animation style and colors. Great satire on power and class based systems. Money can buy a lot of things but not necessarily love :-P,1488844800,,256,4.468085106382978
