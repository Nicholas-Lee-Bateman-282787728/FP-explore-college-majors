6588320,3,B00MK8K4OW,"Black Coal, Thin Ice,"" a Chinese thriller that won top prize at the 2014 Berlin Film Festival, is a downbeat noir film with elements borrowed from Chinatown and The Third Man. Zhang (Fan Liao) is an ex-cop traumatized by a brutal shooting he witnessed five years earlier while on the trail of a killer who left chopped-up body parts in piles of coal. Now on the bottle, with a broken marriage behind him, Zhang works as a coal factory security guard and becomes obsessed with a new case: corpses are being discovered chopped up in the same way but with a bizarre new detail  the feet have ice skates attached. With the cooperation of his former police colleagues, Zhang investigates and becomes fascinated with the first victims widow (Lun Mei Gwei).

Director Yinan Diao incorporates many elements of classic film noir into this macabre murder thriller. Zhang is damaged goods as a cop but becomes intrigued by a series of new crimes. His detectives curiosity piqued, he dives in head first in an attempt to solve the case on his own and redeem himself. Set in wintry urban northern China, the movie benefits from production design that contributes significantly to the dark tone by its use of frost, fog, and dim streetlights.

With a pace that tends to plod, Black Coal, Thin Ice uses a gruesome series of crimes as its hook. Once involved, were held by the performances, the numerous allusions to classic Hollywood thrillers, a variation on the femme fatale character, and the moody, evocative cinematography.

There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray release. The unrated film is in Mandarin, with English subtitles.",1443312000,3,1623,4.869565217391305
6588321,5,B00MK8K4OW,"This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Even though, by Western standards, the third act is a bit of an anti-climax. Still, it's a taut, skillfully-photographed mystery. The director has mastered a move I associate his countryman, Hou Hsiou-Hsien: long takes that manage to flip your perspective with a simple bit of staging. As an example, I will spoil the first shot of the film. As first you think the camera is static atop a pile of coal. You hear trucks moving around, and you see coal dumped into frame (along with a body part). Then, a moment later the shadows shift and the camera pans up. You realize the coal pile is not static, but in fact in the back of a giant truck, which is part of a long convoy of coal trucks.

The film, without cheating the believability of the narrative, has many, many more surprises, large and small. Its male and female protagonists are flawed and fascinating. It's decade-long time frame reminded me of other epic detective stories like ZODIAC or TRUE DETECTIVE SEASON ONE, but the mystery has at once more resolution and less. You'll see.

If you like modern noir, this is a definite blind buy.",1437436800,7,1152,4.533653846153846
6588322,4,B00MK8K4OW,"The plot is that two cops who have had their careers ruined, by a case that went horribly wrong, decide to reunite. This they do after a murder that has striking similarities to the one that floored them happens again.

Zhang Zili has lost everything, his wife, the job he loved and has turned to the bottle as he goes through the motions as an underpaid security guard. Then he gets the chance to solve the case that is his nemesis. This is not a police procedural though; this has elements of the heart, base existentialism and even dark humour.

This is from director and writer Yi'nan Diao who brought us `Night Train' and `Uniform'. He comes from a very industrialised part of China and this is generally reflected in his films - and indeed it is here. Also the loneliness that comes from the isolating capacity of industrialised living. This though is a confident and assured piece of film making. Even when I thought a scene or two had stayed going a tad too long, he just reveals why and all of a sudden you are right back on track. In Mandarin and running to around 100 minutes this will appeal to those who appreciate modern Chinese cinema and who like a bit of dark brooding to their crime thrillers.",1437004800,2,1211,4.475113122171946
6588323,3,B00MK8K4OW,"Some films are praised by critics, but receive a mixed response from general audience. Black Coal, Thin Ice is that kind of a film. This is a crime thriller, or a film noir, set in modern-day China, but the writer/director Diao Yinan seems more interested in capturing the peoples lives in his country, than telling the detective story. In other words, this is a film to be admired, not to be enjoyed.

The film starts with the year 1999, when parts of a human body are discovered in different coal factories in North China. Police detective Zhang Zili (Liao Fan) leads the investigation which ends in a fiasco. Five years later, when another dead body is found, Zhang Zili, now a disgraced ex-detective, embarks on investigation and meets a beautiful female clerk Wu Zhizhen (Gwei Lun-Mei) at a laundry.

The complicated (or contrived) storyline itself is that of a typical film noir: the male investigator with a past, a mysterious female or femme fatale, etc. What makes Black Coal, Thin Ice unique is its focus on the mundane life of those who are lonely and not rich living in the drab city. The camera often lingers on the same scene, as if it completely forgot telling the story.

While some of the camerawork are interesting, the overuse of long takes only makes the viewer sleepy. Also, I respect the intention of the director who brings in realism, but what he wants to say about the rich and the poor in China is nothing new and original. Black Coal, Thin Ice is certainly often visually striking, and has its own style, but maybe too much conscious of it.",1425340800,8,1567,4.649819494584838
6588324,2,B00MK8K4OW,"Dull mainland Chinese crime film.  As it opens dismembered body parts are discovered in multiple coal plants across an entire province in China.  Five years later there are two more victims found in a similar way and once all three men are identified they can all be linked to the same woman, an employee in a dry cleaning shop.

The set-up is promising enough but it doesn't seem like Black Coal, Thin Ice is actually meant to be entertaining.  It leans hard on the drama side of crime drama and is generally drab and dull.  Unlike in the west where the crime genre usually features detectives who are very good at their jobs the police here are barely competent.  Several officers die as a result of very dumb mistakes and the ex-detective who ultimately solves the case rarely seems to know what he's doing--at a dinner given in his honor for solving the case he says it was blind luck and that he was mostly stumbling around in the dark--and he really wasn't being modest.

I really don't know what the point of the coda was and don't much care--it was just nice to see the end credits finally come up.  It's possible that people who are fans of mainland Chinese films will find more to appreciate here than I did--I just found the story slow and uninvolving and by the time the police made their final sad arrest I wondered why I wasted an hour and forty nine minutes of my life watching this thing rather than turning it off much earlier.",1422403200,3,1444,4.4638783269961975

Perhaps I've seen too many American/European detective films, and have a preconceived notion of what SHOULD happen (although enjoying all unexpected twists and turns)... and while I don't want something as cut and dry as a CSI episode the elements that make up this film, and the damaged characters need a better jigsaw puzzle of a narrative to work satisfactorily.

And the ending makes no sense... even for an art house sensibility.",1457481600,,619,4.775700934579439
