I highly recommend this movie if you enjoyed Memento, Requiem for a Dream, and/or Inception.  Can't wait to see what these guys do next!",1382400000,4,244,5.368421052631579
5890399,5,B00E4V0GUK,"Roulette: A Film by Erik Kristopher Myers, covers the story of Dean, Richard, and Sunny. Three people from three very different backgrounds who have come together for a deadly game of Russian Roulette and one last session of group therapy.

This is one of those rare films that come along every couple of years. It's haunting, thrilling, and thought provoking. With controversial subject matters that go into the darkest emotions a human can have. You are put in a room with three people who have no reason to live. You'll be gripping the arm rests of your chair up until the final moments of the film. Award winning performances, directing, and writing, are joined with an attention to detail and passion that shows what an art film making really is. You will not regret watching this, and you won't be the same person after it ends.",1377648000,8,834,4.712328767123288

As far as independent films go, Roulette is a masterpiece. From beginning to end, the story takes you on a journey through the lives and minds of three interwoven characters, who possess traits of which we can all identify in one way or another. Sunny, the devout god-fearing good girl, fallen from grace into a life of sin and denial. Richard, the ""normal"" professional who hides behind his personal and marital issues, and spirals into a self-destructive drunken torment. And Dean, the pretty-boy manly-man who is pulled from his perfect life on cloud nine by the wrath of subconsciousness and lies. All are doomed. Or are they? I'll never tell. It's a surprise.

This story is no walk in the park. It's brutal. It's intense. It's disturbing. Some may say ""offensive"". But those are all qualities that make this film a complete gem, and a perfect find for those of us who love and appreciate the art of quality filmmaking. Writer and director Erik Kristopher Myers knows what he is doing. In more ways than one. Everything about Roulette, from the script, to the shot design, to the editing, is done with perfection and incredible attention to detail. It is truly a work of art. And one to behold.

The filmmaking world better be ready for Erik Kristopher Myers. Roulette is a must see. Order it. If you don't, it will come back around to you.",1375660800,5,1488,4.650190114068441
5890401,5,B00E4V0GUK,"A reprint of my review from IMDB for this film...
I love movies. At the theater, at home... Horror, comedy, thriller, action, all kinds.

Like many folks I love the theater experience, but I have a home theater too, so I kinda get it at home, with cheaper popcorn, and the ability to pause the flick while I go to the bathroom.

When I like a film, I see it more than once, each time, I look at it with a little bit of a different perspective... focusing on the music, sound, lighting, cinematography, acting, directing... maybe I can be a little critical, but if I like a film, I want to break it down into its parts and see what made it tick.

So, along came a locally made indie film called ROULETTE. As with most lower budget indie films, I went into it not knowing exactly what to expect. Filmmaker Erik Kristopher Myers boasted that he was trying to make a film on a tiny budget that would look like a 2 million dollar film.

That's a heck of a boast.

Now,I've been fortunate to see this film several times now, at a theater, on a screen at a festival, and on my big screen in my man-cave... and it seems to hold up every time. In fact, it actually seemed to get better.

The film begins with our three principal actors in a support group meeting. Actors Mike Baldwin, Ali Lukowski and Will Haza begin to take us with them on an incredible journey of self-reflection as we enter a ""suicide room"" with them, where the three proceed to flash back on their lives leading up to the support meeting, while playing a drunken game of Russian roulette.

So we start off the film with a bizarre premise, that delves into the humanity and horrors of their lives, eventually converging to a climactic confrontation that shows why the three of them are ultimately connected. I called it a journey, and that's really what the actors deliver here. With award winning performances by both Haza and Lukowski (and it is criminal that there also wasn't one for Baldwin), and surrounded by an amazingly talented supporting cast, you are drawn into their world, and become a part of their lives. At times I hated them, and at times I felt great pity for them, but that is how they were trying to portray the characters, and I believed every moment of their screen time as those three troubled souls.

As for those supporting actors, not one gave me a performance that I could not believe, and they seemed as important to the audience as they were to the main stars... casting in this film was very well done. Stand out amongst the supporting cast would be Jan-David Soutar as Lukowski's boyfriend, such a natural presence on screen, so I expect we will see a lot more of him in the future along with Haza, Lukowski and Baldwin. Well, we SHOULD see more of them... the acting in this film was nothing short of remarkable.

After watching it the first time, I knew there had to be more to this film than just great acting. The story itself moves at a slow pace, and pulls you along with it kicking and screaming. Most filmmakers would not have made a film like that, But Myers managed to craft the film in such a way, that at no time do you become distracted by the pacing, in fact, it helps to make all the events seem more real and believable.

Lighting seemed to play an important role in the film as well. Myers and his team played with color, giving each of the principal characters their own color tone throughout the film, and as their stories intertwined, these colors muted together, culminating in the stark reds of the ""suicide room"" scenes. This was a subtle effect, probably one most audience members would not even notice, but it helped to draw you more into the story, and its eventually finish. It was this type of attention to detail, and an engaging screenplay, that makes a film like Roulette stand up to repeated viewings.

With a moody score by composer Dan Schepleng, we are drawn even deeper into the dark waters of our three stars... No, this isn't a happy movie. It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be a powerful film, and there is where it succeeds. Now, many folks will talk about the ""controversial"" final scene with one of the main characters. It's harsh, brutal and difficult to watch, but like master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock did in the infamous PSYCHO shower scene, I'm betting most audience members are actually ""SEEING"" more than is actually being shown. To actually have the audience members imaginations take over at this point is unheard of, but Myers pulls it off.

This is what indie films could be. At what cost? It took Myers several years to see this project through... plagued with production issues, and trying to perfect even the tiniest detail... in the future one could hope that Myers could get the budget he deserves, so he could bring it to the screen quicker... not with less quality, but frankly, I'd like to see more of what he has in his twisted mind.

So, did he make a 2 million dollar film on a small budget? No. More like 3. Will I watch it again? Most likely. On a scale of Small popcorn to Large popcorn with extra butter:

I give it a Large popcorn with extra butter.",1375056000,7,5121,4.4689507494646685
8601104,5,B00E4V0GUK,Absolutely loved the twists and turns in the movie. Very well done. I love independent films. This film is worth the buy. You think you know what is going to happen and then something changes to make you second guess yourself. I have watched this movie over and over again with different people just to see their reactions and I end up finding things in the movie that I missed the last time I watched it.,1419897600,,405,4.342105263157895
8601105,1,B00E4V0GUK,I will never be able to recover the 113 minutes of my life I wasted watching this film. The acting is wooden and completely without soul or passion. The script is sophomoric. It is really a bad movie. There's nothing more to say. You've been warned.,1416787200,,249,4.434782608695652
8601106,1,B00E4V0GUK,"I have no idea why this movie got such great reviews. The acting is absolutely horrible! And the plot does have a twist - I'll grant you that, but it wasn't worth waiting until the end to find out what it is.

Roulette is basically a story about the choices we make in life and the chances we have for redemption but don't often take. That sounds like a great theme, and it would be if the movie were well-written. Unfortunately, each of the characters was messed up from the start and they just went from bad to worse. I understand that some people might like the fact that the plot has religious undertones - if we do a certain something (I can't say what it is or I'll give away the movie) then we are doomed - but there are too many cliche`s and exaggerated parts of the storyline. And did I mention that the acting is horrible? It is really horrible.

Sorry, but it's thumbs way down for Roulette.",1409356800,,902,4.269005847953216
8601107,1,B00E4V0GUK,"I watched the first 1-2 minute and KNEW immediately that I was watching a film BELOW a ""B-film"". Horrible acting. It's like you're watching the ""actors"" act. It's forced. I threw in the towel in 2 minutes (less)
If you're a serious and discriminating Cinephile, don't buy/rent this movie. Watching ants march across your floor is more quality entertainment. It's at least for real. HORRIBLE",1407196800,2,390,5.015384615384615
8601108,3,B00E4V0GUK,"I didn't watch this movie throughout, caught bits and pieces of it while doing housework in my abode and it seems like it may or may not have been well done, to some extent.  I think the set designs and lighting were OK, worthy of 4 stars, but a big chunk of the dialogue was trite and the actors delivered the lines as if they were reading cue cards while doing it.  And the words didn't sound like they were coming from the actor's mouths.  The ""religious nut""'s actor seemed more convincing as a  Russian Roulette contestant than she did as a Bible-thumper.  Watching the doctor at the ""abortion clinic"" try to ""tell-off"" the Bible thumper was annoying.  She came off as aware that her arguments were weak, perhaps this explains why she assumed the BTRN had no life experience and used her tongue as a poking instrument as she used that as her closing statement.  And Mr. Corporate American Alchoholic couldn't quit whining about how he lost his promotion, and, like the abortion doctor, couldn't deliver his lines as if he was convinced at what he was saying.
The guy in the wheelchair was the only one who seemed convincing during all the whole of what I saw.  His girlfriend / wife / ex-wife's dialogue struck me as incredibly corny.  The character surprised me as she did try to stick with the guy even though I got the impression she eventually had to bail on him (and I wouldn't blame her either; the guy had MS or whatever it was before he proposed to her, so, really, he asked her to agree to take care of a sick man without telling her he was sick...not entirely bait and switch but one does expect to have a few++ years of happiness with their spouse before having to deal with that kind of stuff).
Not a bad film, if I had paid more attention to it and saw the whole thing I'm sure I could go on and on about the plot and the way the lighting and set design complimented it and so on and so forth, but the dialogue and the performances were just too amateurish for my liking.",1392508800,,1989,4.354054054054054
8601109,5,B00E4V0GUK,"I have never seen a film quite like this. All the elements pull you into the film, from the sound, to the story, and of course the characters. Very dark and twisted but worth the viewing. It will leave you speechless and wanting to watch it again and again. Every time I watch it I find something I missed before. I can't wait to see what else they do! Bravo!",1387065600,2,359,4.142857142857143
8601110,4,B00E4V0GUK,"Well written, well acted. LOVED Ali's character and her acting was superb.  Kept me up way too late waiting to see the unexpected and twisted ending. Worth the watch.",1385942400,3,166,4.724137931034483
8601111,5,B00E4V0GUK,"This film is one of the most twisted, thought provoking, emotional rollercoster that I have been on in a long time. Wow! Great job Erik Kristopher Myers and cast!!! I'm glad I made it a part of my collection.",1384905600,3,208,4.358974358974359
8601112,3,B00E4V0GUK,"I believe that all the other reviews to date are reviewing the limited theatrical release.  The Blu-Ray release looks like it was done on recordable media and is not up to usual Blu-ray standards.  The most disturbing part is the lack of audio sync at the beginning of the movie.  It makes the film look like a poorly dubbed version.  The sound track is Dolby 2.0 and the video is 60 Hz.  The only extra is a theatrical trailer.  Technically, there is no reason that this film couldn't have been released on DVD instead.

I enjoy low budget indie productions and like to support emerging film makers. This film has a plot that does hold interest.  Several scenes appeared stilted and the music track became more and more intrusive.  If this was a film school project, I'd say it was a good freshman outing.  The characters were one-sided which was expected.  If you are looking for it, I'd save your money and wait until the DVD comes out at a reduced price.",1384560000,2,958,4.511627906976744
8601113,5,B00E4V0GUK,"A must see!!!
We were able to see this previous to its release.. now excited to buy it and re watch! Great artistic value all around.",1383696000,4,133,4.153846153846154
