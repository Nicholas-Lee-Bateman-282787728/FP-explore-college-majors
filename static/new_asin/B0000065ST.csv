7903836,1,B0000065ST,"People like me who've seen the first one know that this one was nothing but a money making ploy by the movie producers & people at the company. (Artisan Ent.??) THe first one had humor, heart, and that loveable, bumbling Felix & his dog Rambo. The sequel--if you can call it that--is unoriginal, unimaginative, and downright boring. They reused the same theme from the first movie. How unoriginal is that!!!  If there was a 0 on the rating system that would be my real rating for this movie. A BIG FAT 0!!",1091491200,6,505,4.489130434782608
