6196024,5,B00HQ8C9EY,"John Beattie surfed Long Island for over four decades. He's hit the world class spots and all the unknown, come and go breaks that shift with the seasons. He know when it's going to fire and where. This lifetime of local knowledge pays off big in A Hundred Miles to The End as John's camera beautifully captures the best of the Island's waves in a visually stunning homage to surfing for the love of surfing.",1389225600,,408,4.453333333333333
6196025,5,B00HQ8C9EY,"I'm not a surfer...but lived near the ocean many years and enjoyed watching the surfers.  I enjoyed this video very much...very well produced and entertaining..I saw the trailers....which is enspiring me to buy the video.
Jeannie Nemeth....well done John.",1389225600,,255,5.538461538461538
6196026,5,B00HQ8C9EY,"Iv'e Surfed on Long Island for 40 years and this movie really portrays how special the Surf culture is on L.I. Island.  The footage really shows the quality of waves that can be had if your patient and committed. I've surfed all over the world and i'll take a head high day out in Montauk in September over any other wave in the world. ""Home is where the Surf is "" Thanks John for a great movie and awesome Music !
Peace

6196027,5,B00HQ8C9EY,"I don't know if it is the best East Coast surf film or not, it's not for me to say. All I wanted to do when I started out making this film was to stay connected to Surfing. I had a stroke in 2007 and residual weakness keep's me from Surfing. This film was my way of staying connected to the ocean. So you be the judge, follow along as a lifelong surfer rediscovers many of the places he's surfed over the past 5 decades.  From Long Beach to Montauk you'll meet the surfers and see some of the best surf spots in New York. Oh you didn't know that there's surf in New York? Then your in for a nice surprise.
See the trailer here; [...]

8634187,5,B00HQ8C9EY,"Finally someone tells the story of Long Island surfing and it's a great one!

Fantastic (""You have surf on Long Island?"") waves, best I've ever seen on the east coast (or pretty much anywhere, for that matter). Accurately discusses the Long Island surf scene -- just don't tell anyone that the wave quality shown in the film is once-in-a-lifetime only!

Long Island surfers are a tough breed, no doubt about it. Bottom line: great story, great waves and excellent videography from NYC to Montauk.",1399593600,,496,4.892857142857143
8634188,5,B00HQ8C9EY,I heard about this film from my cousins who surfed Long Island growing up. Great footage that shows New York has some serious waves ! And the music is really outstanding - enjoyed it very much. Also liked the $1.99 rental for the week - watched it a couple of times.,1391990400,,266,4.235294117647059

8634190,5,B00HQ8C9EY,EXCELLENT depiction of the Long Island surf culture. 1:30 non-stop minutes of great waves and great wave riders. Make sure you watch this film in a meat locker. It is that hot!,1389312000,,176,4.53125
8634191,5,B00HQ8C9EY,"John did an incredible job of inviting the viewer into a surf culture found nowhere else.  What Long Island lacks in a tropical landscape, it makes up for in the adventure of getting to the surf whether it's by boat, car, or 4x4.  Set 100 miles apart are two of the best breaks on the East coast with scores of fun, crowdless breaks in between.  Must see!",1389225600,,355,4.268656716417911
8634192,5,B00HQ8C9EY,"Saw this at the premier in Sayville last year. A must for every Long Island surfer, and a great one for those out of state. It is proof that NY does get excellent waves, has great surfers and this is very well filmed.",1389225600,,217,4.069767441860465
8634193,5,B00HQ8C9EY,"This is one of the best surf films that I have ever seen. filled with amazing shots, great music and my favorite places on Long Island. John has truly captured the feeling and the characters on the East Coast Surf scene. Truly a classic to add to your collection! ~ Wendy Tarlow",1389225600,,278,4.365384615384615
