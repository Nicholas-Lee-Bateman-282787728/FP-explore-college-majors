Come on!",1425859200,,73,4.538461538461538
8328313,5,B001NY4WZ6,"I was originally in the market for the film An American Rhapsody when I came across this set. An American Rhapsody is a bit of a rare find unless you are willing to spend at least 20 bucks, and I am a very frugal shopper so needless to say I have been shopping around for this film for quite some time. I was so excited to see it was one of the filns included in this set. Girl With a Pearl Earring is also a great inclusion, and it's a movie I don't own. A Good Woman is the third film in this set and I do already own this one and I love it as it is based on a piece by Oscar Wilde. I'm just going to give my other copy to my mom. I know a lot of people probably don't understand why they chose these films to use as a set but I personally think these films show Scarlett Johansson's range of acting ability and her overall talent. I also think it shows her willingness to do small budget indie films that may not be winning her an Oscar but certainly give her a chance to show off her amazing talent. Overall I think this is a great set and a really good deal.",1365379200,8,1063,3.8807339449541285

8328315,4,B001NY4WZ6,"First off, I would give this collection 4 stars no matter what Scarlett Johansson films were in this set. I think all of her movies are awesome and worth watching over and over again. I don't understand why the films in this set were chosen. I don't think they are her best work but they are good non the less. I think movies like: The Island, Lost in Translation, and Match Point would have made a better collection. Even though those weren't the movies chosen, this is still a good collection. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. Girl with a Pearl Earring is very good movie as well as the Good Woman. Scarlett can pull off other time period very well. Not to mention that she is sexy while doing her acting roles. I haven't seen American Rhapsody yet but I'm sure it doesn't fall short. I will definitely be adding this set to my collection of DVDs.",1236902400,10,852,4.33125
