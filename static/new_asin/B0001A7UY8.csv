That means not a single movie critic gave it a positive review. Watching this car-wreck-of-a-movie, you understand why. What a waste of talent. What were they thinking? More to the point, what the heck were they smoking????? This is a true piece of dog poop!  Isn't it interesting that Christopher Guest wanted nothing to do with this. Good move, Chris!!!!!!!!",1127779200,2,525,4.898876404494382
1983071,1,B0001A7UY8,"maybe shearer thinks he is on the money , but after seeing all the evidence all I can call this is dis-information at its finest. Go watch Alex Jone's infiltration of Bohemian Grove first or read up on the grove from historians. Shearer is obviously ignorent although i do like how he tries to take swipes at Mr. Jones",1081987200,4,318,4.406779661016949

8008969,5,B0001A7UY8,"I have read the extremely negative reviews on IMDb and the lackluster reviews right here on amazon. I guess I understand. The humor is sly and dry, and gets funnier with repeated viewings, so this isn't for those who are seeking instant gratification. I also understand that members of a certain political party in this country would not find this funny, as it pokes fun at their values, and at their leaders. Harry Shearer was indeed a guest at the Bohemian Grove, so this movie is more accurate than you might think. Personally, I love it. I have watched it over and over. I totally get it. If you are fans of movies such as the original M.A.S.H, then you might like this one.",1431129600,4,678,4.475806451612903

8008971,5,B0001A7UY8,"I am surprised this movie ever got released; not because it's bad because it isn't; because the Bohemian Grove is still a subject of controversy and world conspiracy. However, this film gives it a very comedic twist with outrageous humor. Enjoy it but you should also be thinking one thing as well; this is what our world leaders do for fun and that scares the heck out of anyone that has seen the Bohemian Grove exposed on YouTube. Seriously, these are the people in charge of nukes and they still are not showing everything that goes on there. Funny yet thought provoking in that way.",1395360000,3,586,4.59047619047619
8008972,5,B0001A7UY8,"I don't understand negative experiences with Teddy Bear's Picnic. I love it. The combination of silly and satire makes for entertainment that is great fun.

Perhaps one seeking Harry Shearer's Le Show bite, are turned off by the slapstick gags, but for me that's part of the movie's charm. It's not a documentary about the Bohemian Club. (I'd like to see such a documentary, also.) Teddy Bear's Picnic is a fictional comedy.

I highly recommend it.

P.S., if you liked Shearer's novel, Not Enough Indians, I bet you'll enjoy Teddy Bear's Picnic. And, if you like the movie, read the novel.",1374451200,,589,4.811881188118812
8008973,3,B0001A7UY8,I expected this movie to be a lot more funny poking fun at the Bohemian Grovers but I was somewhat let down. It did have some truth to it. People really should consider the reality behind this comedy & see  the truth of what goes on behind the scenes at the Bohemian Grove & the powerful people who go there who are the Ruling Elite of our Country & the world!

8008974,4,B0001A7UY8,"Hey! Let's make fun of the idle rich and politicians than run this country! Great fun and great satire from harry Shearer and his warped mind! This film did so-so in the theaters, but has a chieved a cult following thanks to harry Shearer. Get it and be prepared to laugh at all the stereotypes of the idle rich.",1167782400,3,312,4.305084745762712
8008975,4,B0001A7UY8,"""Teddy Bear's Picnic"" is an acquired taste. Of that, there can be no doubt. Harry Shearer injects a subtle sense of mayhem in this clever comedy that pokes fun of people who we have entrusted to run the world around us. From politicians to corporate power brokers, we either tolerate or trust them to ""do the right thing."" When they get together, we suspect the sort of collusion that conspiracy theorists thrive on. Instead, what we get are a bunch of spoiled power-mongers, taking too much advantage of their status in society, and the results are hilarious.

Yes, this is Harry Shearer doing what he does best - a biting satire of a small portion of our society. He has put together an eclectic cast of characters that you won't see assembled in any other movie - worth it for that alone!

If you don't appreciate subtle, borderline intellectual humor - you won't like this. The best jokes will be lost on you. But if you are the type of person who laughed at Dennis Miller's references on Monday Night Football, you should love this.",1139270400,6,1037,4.6
