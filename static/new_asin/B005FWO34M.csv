4686145,5,B005FWO34M,"I loved every minute!  Perfect portrayals of the comic book. The vibe from everyone on the Xmen team, made it a crazy great experience!  Hats off to marvel knights !!  I will buy every single marvel knights dvd that comes out just to support this, so it never ever goes away!! Better than the movies played by real people by far. This is the real Xmen!

Black panther was amazing !
Spiderwoman amazing ! Ironman was great .. If your a marvel fan this is a must to watch . I liked them so much I pre order the dvd's now without even seeing them first..
Thank you for the effort marvel knights!!",1398470400,2,593,4.221238938053097
4686146,5,B005FWO34M,Great collection and I could not be happier with it. I bought my brother one as well and he loved it as well,1390089600,2,108,3.739130434782609
4686147,1,B005FWO34M,"I was very disappointed in the animation. It was discribed as new high tech animation, but it turned out more like card board cut outs.  The black panther was good, and the Loki &Thor computer animation was good, just a lame story, with next to no Thor in it.  I would not recomend this as a bundle, it's a waste of money. You can buy them seperate, so I only recommend the black panther.",1356220800,7,388,4.22972972972973

4686149,5,B005FWO34M,"These motion comics are great! Most people complain because these are not animated movies. Joss wedon really knows his stuff. Its astounding how people lack the necessary imagination to watch these comics. Lets remember that the stories Joss has captured are for those of us who love marvel comics. Thease are for those of us who cant get enough of these action pack imaginotive storylines. If ur into ur cokie cuter movies were u really don't have to pay attention, these r not 4 u.",1336003200,12,483,4.694117647058824
4686150,5,B005FWO34M,"First off, these are motion comics, not animated movies.  Some people don't take responsibility for not understanding what they are purchasing.
These are some of the greatest stories (including Astonishing X-Men by Joss Whedon).
If you don't like motion comics, these aren't for you.  If you don't know what a motion comic is, go to You Tube and search for Motion Comics.  The conversation that begins at about 6:05 in Astonishing X-Men episode 1 is a great example of how fun these stories and style is!
Again, it's sad when those who complain are those who are ignorant, not knowing, about what they are purchasing.
Enjoy!",1327017600,21,624,4.867924528301887
4686151,1,B005FWO34M,"These Motion Comics are LAME LAME LAME.  I do suggest you get the BOOKS these are from.  The books are wonderful.  This animated (and I use the term loosely) crap is an insult.  Seriously, how lazy can you be to sit and watch ""a motion comic"" - just go read the damn comic, you'll have a much better time",1323388800,6,304,4.101694915254237
4686152,5,B005FWO34M,"I love all of these motion comics.  They literally bring the comics to life, but do not expect full animation.  They take the pages straight from the graphic novels, animate limited movement both in, and between the frames, and spruce it up with voice acting and music so it has a cinematic quality.  Like I said, they are literally the comics come to life.  I think this is a great story telling medium and I hope both Marvel and DC continue to release their books in this format.  Highly recommended.",1319414400,22,502,4.533333333333333
4686153,1,B005FWO34M,"I hate these cheap ass movies but thats Marvels style. Why spend money on a quality product when we can put out these crappy ones that we spend no money on. They remind me of those old ""Clutch Cargo and Space Angle"" where they they had a real persons mouth on the character and it kinda floated around the mouth area. Marvel has ruined my enjoyment of watching my favorite superheroes on tv",1316908800,5,390,4.3561643835616435

8470734,5,B005FWO34M,"Lots of ignorant comments about the genre of motion comics. The work is brilliant and creative.  Use your brain for something more than just a hollow opening of `nothingness` to fill with your ignorance, stupidity, and lack of appreciation of another individual`s effort at creativity.  DC did something similar to this with Jonah Hex which I'd say might have been executed slight better than these motion comics  but if you like the motion comics genre you won't be disappointed with this set.",1503878400,,494,5.0

8470742,5,B005FWO34M,"The box is fantastic but until now i couldn't see the movie comics. When i bought them i didn't pay attention about the right region of the blu ray discs: Region B/2 (Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand).

I live in Brazil and here in my country is almost impossible to buy an unblocked bluray player who reads an B/2 disc.

It seems there are only a Pioneer model that plays all the regions: Pioneer BPD-140. Is that correct?
My Sony and Samsung players doesn't read it.",1417046400,6,521,4.6521739130434785
