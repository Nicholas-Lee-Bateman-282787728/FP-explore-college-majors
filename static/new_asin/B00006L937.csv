7971131,5,B00006L937,"When the first time I saw this DVD, I can't help buying it right away and I am glad I have done it. This film captures the 30 memorable MLB moments from 1905 to 2001. For me, this film also serves as a review and expands my knowledge of MLB. Although I am not familiar with every moment, I can still feel moved or excited when watching many of them.

Some of these moments can be seen or mentioned in the movies or TV very often. For example, the Lou Gehrig's ""luckiest man"" speech is imitated in the movie ""Sleepless in Seattle"". The 1975 Carlton Fisk moment is mentioned in the movie ""Good Will Hunting"". The Catch in 1954 by Willie Mays is also mentioned frequently on sports program today. Knowing these moments is indeed helpful in understanding other matters.

Since there are so many moments condensed in such a short time (about 2 hours), each moment just shares a brief mention. For people who want to know more about these moments in addition to those key minutes, they may need to do a search job somewhere.",1180742400,,1018,4.438502673796791
7971132,5,B00006L937,"This DVD holds a VERY special place in my heart.  My mom was around 90 when her cousin visited her for a day.  He asked me if my husband liked baseball.  I answered that he certainly did and that he would be joining us for lunch.

Much time and conversation later, the cousin asked my husband, ""Do you know who Johnny Vandermeer is?""  ""Of course!"" answered my husband, ""He pitched back-to-back 'No Hitters' against the Boston Braves and the Brooklyn Dodgers back in '38.""

A voice piped up from the other end of the table, and my mom asked, ""Isn't that the kid we used to play baseball with every day after school?""  Indeed it was the same ""kid"".  No wonder Mom could hit anything she aimed at.

This is the only available footage of Vandermeer that I know of and I would have loved to see more of him on the DVD.  A little known fact is that he also pitched six no hit innings into the next game.

So, to those who thought there was too much talking and not enough footage, you have a point.  But I challenge you to dig into the history of these older players and introduce your kids to people who played ""for the love of the game"".",1141862400,4,1133,4.21860465116279
7971133,2,B00006L937,"This was a real disappointment because I wanted a DVD to watch with my little leaguer to get him excited about the game and what could be done on the baseball field. He was bored as it was mostly talking heads with very little actual footage of great moments. Lots of behind the scenes and historical reminiscing about great moments....but only a moment or two of actual game footage.
This DVD is not a highlight film...it's a talk show.",1089244800,26,437,4.544303797468355

DVD is the best thing I ever saw",1042761600,9,133,4.826086956521739
7971135,4,B00006L937,"As an avid fan of the game and follower of the history, I was looking forward to this DVD very much. I had seen a bunch of these clips in ESPN, which I thought were very well done. This DVD has some masterful footage ranging from Gehrig's speech to Hubbell's strikeouts to Maris' chase of the Babe into Barry and Number 73. The special features piece is also interesting -- as an example, to hear Billy Ripken and his outtake on Cal coming through in big games, or each of the milestones homeruns that Bonds has reached in his career.
The one tiny piece lacking and again, I say this as an avid fan, was that all the clips have been edited to fit into this DVD. So what you will find is a 9 minute segment is now a 4 minute segment...but hey! to find all 30 memorable moments in one DVD and have about 135 minutes of footage (including the special features) ..makes me give this two thumbs up.
A great gift for a baseball fan, or any sports fan for that matter.",1040169600,54,961,4.2
