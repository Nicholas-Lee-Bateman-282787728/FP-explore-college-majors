8324059,4,B0009E27IK,"This was my first attempt at yoga.  Louise Solomon's approach to teaching is very easy to follow.  I wasn't sore the next day but I did work up a sweat and found the stretches and poses were quite challenging.  Louise has a very soothing voice and I find these workouts to be both a relaxing and an effective way to get into shape.
All the 3 workouts and the relaxation at the end take about an hour & a half.  You can skip the first couple of introductory parts after you have seen them once or twice reducing the time to a little over an hour.  I sometimes only do the first two workouts.",1123632000,,590,4.140350877192983
