8333580,1,B001PKPVOE,"The dance sequence is complicated but not impossible except for the choppy camera work where it kept going to an oblique angle when I was trying to learn the basic steps.  It could have followed the instructor straight on more, especially when she was explaining it!  I have better workouts for cardio.  This one seems like too much trouble.",1508112000,,341,4.745762711864407

8333582,2,B001PKPVOE,"The main workout was a 40 minute dance routine that was a cardio routine.  Not what I was expecting when I bought a DVD to tone my butt, hips and thighs.  I was very disappointed because I have two left feet and had trouble with the routine.  It moved fast, there wasn't a lot of explaining and I just didn't enjoy it at all.  I wasn't a big fan of the instructor either but it would be because I was annoyed at the routine and it just put me in a bad mood but I didn't think the moves were explained well at all.

There was also a 10 minute more traditional lower body workout that would tone your but, hips and thighs but it was short and not very challenging.

There was a 10 minute total body toning bonus that was probably the best part of the DVD that used weights and compound moves to help tone all of your body.

This was not worth the purchase and I don't do this one hardly ever.  If you enjoy a good dance routine to help with cardio you might enjoy this one but it did not provide what I wanted at all.",1446422400,2,1015,3.99009900990099
8333583,1,B001PKPVOE,"First, the dvd has two sections:  A cardio section (along with a bonus workout) and two short toning workouts.

The cardio was very difficult to follow.  I am not a dancer and struggle with dance workouts.  I haven't spent enough time to get it down.

The toning workouts were fun but fairly easy.

If it was just the dvd, I would give it three starts.

My biggest issues is that this is a reissue of Shape Your Butt, Hips and Thighs.  They changed the name and changed th cover but the workout is the same.  (I am not certain which came first).  Now I have both and feel like I was tricked.",1409702400,3,591,4.196428571428571
8333584,5,B001PKPVOE,"I'm not crazy for the cardio segment at the begining, but the toning  segment is excellent! Lisa is a great instructor and if you like her Method and Dance Fit stuff, you'll like this too.",1341187200,3,188,4.371428571428571
8333585,2,B001PKPVOE,"The other reviews pretty well summed it up: a great workout if you can get it. I've now watched it 3 times, and I spend most of the time just jumping around with my own moves because I give up after several tries. Today I had more time and did lots of rewinding to try to get the moves right, so I could get the benefits, which seem like they'll be great eventually. That camera work is sooooo frustrating---focusing on the other dancers' hips when she's just introduced a new foot routine, which you then can't see. If you're looking for an instantly beneficial workout, this isn't it. If you're patient and want a great dance workout, this is it. A few tips: works better if you're NOT doing it on carpet, and, some of the routines seem to be on a four-beat count, and some on a three-beat, but that's just my non-dancer's best guess! Good luck!",1336780800,4,847,4.367088607594937
8333586,3,B001PKPVOE,Not one of my favorites but it can do once in a while. Cardio can be interesting for someone who likes dancing like that...I don't when I workout. Steps sometimes hard to follow but nothing like those FIRM dvds! Really really like 12 min workouts in this one. Especially the ballet one.,1323561600,2,286,4.519230769230769
8333587,2,B001PKPVOE,"This is a somewhat cardio intense workout with a lot of emphasis on lower body toning.  Lisa Wheeler does not do a good job of explaining what she is doing and the few things she does explain the camera actually cuts away so you can't see it.  It took a long time to get a hang of the complicated moves (if I had a dance background maybe it would have been easier, but most of us don't).  It's like the director and Lisa worked together to make this video hard to use.",1271030400,9,468,4.065217391304348
8333588,4,B001PKPVOE,"This DVD was previously released as Shape your Buns Hips and Thighs (2004) with Lisa Wheeler. The first section of the DVD contains a 38 minute cardio dance workout with rather complicated and tricky choreography.  I think the camera angle is bad on certain moves but I was still able to get it despite my two left feet. Once I was familiar with the workout, I was able to enjoy it  and add more intensity (although still not intense enough for me.) The second section of the DVD contains 12 minutes of all-standing lower body toning such as plies, curtsey lunges, and other classic ballet-inspired movements. The third section of the DVD is performed on the floor with a combination of yoga and pilates moves.  I love the toning segments of this DVD more than the cardio. There is a 12 minute total-body toning workout with Tracy York (the same workout found in Shape Sculpt Your Abs previously released as Shape Your Abs). This workout uses compound moves with weights.",1236124800,19,971,4.7
