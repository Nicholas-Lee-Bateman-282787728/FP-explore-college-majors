1805908,4,B00007CVT8,I thought this movie was overall pretty good..  It of course had the typical plot in the slasher flkicks and the acting was not bad either..  I would recommend it to any horror finatic!,1066262400,,185,4.411764705882353
1805909,2,B00007CVT8,"This is a pretty routine slasher pic.  Some college students on Spring Break in Florida start getting bumped off by a masked killer.  The acting is actually a little better than average for a low budget horror film, but the main problem here is the script.  Too many loose ends!  I still don't know what the titular secret was!",1055548800,3,327,4.491525423728813

7975106,2,B00007CVT8,"What were Joseph Lawrence and Chad Allen thinking?  2 of my favorites. How di they get involved in this tedious film. Even as slasher films go this is a pig and I like slasher films. There is usually some sort of something different that will pull you in, good characters good acting or directing....this missed everything. Joseph Lawrence looked sensational totally buff and so did Chad Allen and that is why 2 stars. The acting was awful, the plot tedious the girls were the epitome of bitchiness (why?) toss in Jeff Conaway as a tortured FBI agent who lost his daughter and the usual bigoted Florida cops that arrests the black guy, just because and you have a movie where you care about nobody. They are vapid and ridiculous stereotypes (which most movies have) but these youwere hoping would get chopped into tiny bits. Jeff Conaway was never an actor...so why??? So unless you want to see Jospeh and Chad looking great in tank tops don't bother. Sorry this was so long.",1394323200,,975,4.6686046511627906
7975107,4,B00007CVT8,"I love horror movies and I love low budget straight to video horror movies sometimes those low budget straight to video horror movies are the best kind. I liked the movie though, however It would not be my first choice if I was having freinds over for a night of chillin and watching scary movies. I will say I liked the rave scene. And if you have a bunch of college students showing a little skin thats always a plus as well as Joey Lawerence in the shower with a girl. Joey Lawerence will always be cool no matter what. It was boring at times and kinda slow moving but it had a good enouph story line to keep me interested. If I go to much into charactar detail I might be giving away to much. So I will just say this. I was kinda hoping the big secret would be more shocking than that. I mean the killer was raised by what looked to me like a priest and a mother who looked a little deranged. I mean I guess you can see the connection. But kids who have parents that are really into religion always kinda struggle to fit in and somtimes they do and sometimes they don't I mean do they really become psychotic? Anyway long story short I enjoyed the movie and who knows I may end up buying it.",1327536000,,1195,4.111111111111111
7975108,1,B00007CVT8,"This was one BAD film! Even for a straight to video horror it is bad! The plot is predictable, the death scenes are cornier than any I have ever seen, and the acting is hard to watch. Why does the killer slut EVERYONE'S throat except the HUGE, MUSCULAR black football player(PLAYED BY TJ FROM MR.ROMANCE)? Instead, he always seems to just bash him in the back of the head while he goes and kills other people. Also, watch for the WORST horror movie disguise in ages...Where did they get the mask the killer wears????? Dumb, pointless and predictable. Not even remotely fun or scary.",1118534400,,582,4.605769230769231
7975109,2,B00007CVT8,"I got this movie on sale a couple years ago.  It looked pretty good, but you know how most of that goes.  I really lke movies like Scream, I thought it would be like that, but nope.  This movie was a hundred percent perdictable.  I knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie.  From the first seen you can tell it's gonna suck.  *Spoiler* The first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway, when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out.  The lights flicker (Wow how original) and a person... in a really, really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax.  This is what happens throughout the entire movie.  Don't waste your time or money.  If you really want to see it i would suggest renting it... not worth more than 3.00 anytime!",1113264000,3,762,4.1931034482758625
7975110,4,B00007CVT8,"I thought ,when I bought this movie, that I was buying another slasher flick, of which I am a huge fan. This turned out not to be the case. This was not a horny young victims movie. It actually was well acted and well written. As a black man though, I must say,Oz, the black football quaterback, who was built like Hulk Hogan fought like Richard Simmons. Everytime someone raised their hand he lost conciousness. I did not expect  a grown up performance from Joseph Lawrence. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is more than the average slasher flick. I hope there is a sequal, but not to soon though. Maybe in the interim someone can teach Oz  how to fight. Maybe if we were not saturated with ""teens gone astray only to be cut up in their prime"" movies, this one would have stood out more. I will certainly be watching this dvd again and again. I am also happy that this slasher flick is cleaner than most, not over sexed and over violenced.",1106352000,3,946,4.4

I love this movie omg its so awsome!!! get this video , GOod all round acting and a Reese Whithersspoon lookalike in this movie , ITS AWSOME GET IUT!!!!!!!!",1103673600,,310,4.0
7975112,1,B00007CVT8,"Do you wanna know a secret? I promise you that you could live without ever finding out. This movie's only secret is who the hell was dumb enough to produce it. I would also like to know why anyone who read the script would have signed a contract to star in it. Joey Lawrenece was obviously hard up for some cash or else he wanted to expand his acting into a new genre... bad films. The DVD is so cheap that there aren't even menus. Suspense?... Drama?... There is absoluetly more suspense and drama in movies like Legally Blonde than this one... also you get to see the real Reese Witherspoon and not a girl who was hired because she looked like RW. Also, if the ""hero"" of the movie gets hit in the head one more time... I swear I thought for a minute I was watching an episode of Jackass. The back cover of the DVD is simply incorrect in its summary of the movie. The spoiler doesn't even provide correct info about the plot. As for the rating, there is no 0 star so I had to give it a 1 star. However, this movie's only 1 star qualification was that it was in color and the text on the back of the case was without spelling errors. The only suggestion I can give is not to buy this DVD. However, rent it if you are having trouble falling asleep. This movie will definately put any insomniac to sleep. Beyond horrible, the only thing left that can be said is... ""Que el infierno!""",1096588800,2,1381,4.195488721804511
7975113,1,B00007CVT8,"What a ripoff of ""i know what you did last summer"" and i didn't even like that movie either but at least Jennifer love Hewitt made it easier to look at.
This movie sucks in every way you can think of...acting, story,  casting, and even the cover art on the DVD blows!
Wait! There's more...wanna see the worst killer ever put on screen? Check this loser out, what kind of mask it that? They must of not had enough money in the budget to get something scarier or at least look cooler..Dollar store quality, for sure!
Listen, take my advice..buy the movie because of it's low price and to see Joey lawrence in his worst performance ever but if your really expecting a good horror/suspense movie..please DO NOT waste your time!
REALLY SO BAD THAT IT'S SAD :(",1090195200,,754,4.463768115942029
7975114,2,B00007CVT8,"Joseph Lawrence looks great in his new buffed up bod; the girls are also quite attractive, including the lovely Dorie Barton.  Jeff Conaway looks like he's on Prozac, and we have Chad Allen as the seemingly strange bad boy.  The pacing in the first part of the movie is very slow, and even when it picks up, it's with such erratic plot jumps that it's impossible to keep up with.  By the bloody climax, we're told what the secret is, but what's the big deal?  Manipulative, average acting, and no real surprises.
Rent, don't buy.",1075593600,2,529,4.536842105263158
