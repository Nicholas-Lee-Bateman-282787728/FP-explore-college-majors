5322347,5,B009EOMNSA,I just watched the movie yesterday and it was great.  love the connection between Katrina and Salman.  I am so happy that YashRaj Films chose to make a movie with Salman it was well worth it and I'm sure he feels the same,1349827200,8,221,4.116279069767442
5322348,4,B009EOMNSA,"In my lifetime, there has been only a single actor who could fill movie theaters and drive audiences to hysteria and that was Amitabh in the 70's. Each of his releases were met with frenzy and box office success. Rajneekanth from the south, aslo creates the same excitement but I have heard not expereicned it. In recent years, Salman Khan creates rabid fans and rewrites box office collections with each subsequent film. his streak started with Wanted, and was followed by Dabanng, Ready, Bodyguard. As I write this Ek Tha Tiger has become the second highest grosser in the history of Indian Cinema.
Ek Tha Tiger is about Tiger( Salman Khan), a spy for the RAW unit of Indian Itelligence. his boss gives him an assignment to trail an Indian scientst at the Trinity College in Dublin, who is also being pursued by the ISI for his work on Nuclear research. In Dublin, Tiger meets a music student who is a parttime housekeeper ( Katrina Kaif)at the professors house. He falls in love and Tiger turns in to a pussy cat.
The film is engaging and has a engaging first half, however the pace slackens a bit when the leads fall in love. The action and the plot takes tiger all over the world from Iraq, Turkey, Dublin and Cuba and that makes the film fun to watch.
The direction is adequate and so are the action scenes. Music is very,very mediocre.
Salman Khan kicks major booty and Katrina and him share a lot of chemistry.
I enjoyed the film ( not plot wise but for the the experience of watching it in a crowded movie theater whilst experiencing the Salman hysteria) but still fail to understand the unprecedented euphoria accompanying the film. As I exited the theater, I overheard a conversation between two men. Did you enjoy the film? said one of the men. The other man replied "" The movie was average but I just came to see my brother Salman and sister in law, Katrina"" That probably sums up his Salmans popularity in his legion of fans..

5322374,5,B009EOMNSA,"This 2012 Bollywood film recently caught my attention while I was scrolling through my recommended list on Netflix. Ek Tha Tiger is now not only one of my favorite Hindi films that I've watched, it is also in my top ten favorite movies of all time. It gave me a greater respect and love for Bollywood movies.
Salman Khan is one of the biggest names in the Bollywood film industry. Well known for his muscular physique, he plays the main character, an Indian spy, in Ek Tha Tiger. Alongside Khan is Katrina Kaif, a half-British, half-Indian actress. Though she initially struggled to learn Hindi and Bollywood dance style, she is now one of the more popular actresses in India.
Without a doubt, I fell in love with Ek Tha Tiger. It was a thrilling mix of action with a romantic subplot. While watching, I also learned a lot about the feud between India and Pakistan and how deep the resentment goes. Although the beginning of the movie might seem a little slow to some, I liked how well the emotions and characters were developed. This prolonged development helped the rest of the story flow better.
I loved both the romance and the action scenes. The mixture of dancing and fighting could have been bizarre, but it worked well and flowed nearly flawlessly to me. Even with this dichotomy, all of the details and scenarios seemed to fall into place. Khan fit his character perfectly, both through his muscular physique and through his portrayal of his character's emotions.
On the other hand, Kaif was a little stiff at times. While Khan's character was believably in love with Kaif's character, her character didn't seem nearly as devoted to Khan's character.
The movie was for the most part perfect and as a fan of spy movies, it seemed believable within the genre.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes spy movies like Mr. & Mrs. Smith. I'd also recommend it to men who want to watch an action movie but have girlfriends who want to watch a romantic movie. Ek Tha Tiger is a really good mix for people with two different tastes. The movie is excellent and fans of the actor and actress, or of Bollywood movies, will enjoy",1410220800,2,2134,4.633245382585752

5322378,4,B009EOMNSA,"I chose this movie b/c I love Katrina Kaif. I was hesitant b/c Ive never been a fan of Salmon Khan ( I think he overdoes it with his acting and facial expressions)and that just ruins it. To my surprise, he did well in this movie.

5322380,4,B009EOMNSA,"This is a fun movie.  It has a lot going for it.  There is action, great locations, romance and a hidden twist!  The makers of this movie could easily do a series like the James Bond series.  The only problem is that the movie makers tried to cram too much into this film by way of ""entertainment"" or song and dance.  A small amount of this would have been okay but they go over the top with it causing the movie to drag out a bit too long. This is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating.  But overall it is still a great movie with some great action scenes!  It's worth watching.",1383696000,,591,3.957627118644068
5322381,3,B009EOMNSA,"Standard Bollywood shoot'm up. Typical ""B"" movie good for a Saturday afternoon.  Not one of Khan's best, but not bad either. It had it's moments.",1382918400,,145,4.8
5322382,3,B009EOMNSA,"A dedicated RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) agent Tiger (Salman Khan) is dispatched on a mission to Dublin, where he meets a beautiful girl named Zoya (Katrina Kaif). Zoya warns him not to fall in love with her, though, of course, he does. By the time Tiger learns the reason, he and Zoya find themselves trapped in a web of international espionage.

Well, in fact, ""Ek Tha Tiger"" is a mindless romantic action movie where, like ""The Tourist"" starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, both romance and action try to amaze us, but somehow fail. The beautiful cinematography provides us with an attractive backdrop for the story to unfold, but unfortunately they forgot to provide an interesting story.

The stars are not to be blamed for the slack pace. They both did s great job here. Action scenes (clearly inspired by one recent James Bond film) are decent, but not very special. I'm fine with the obvious use of body doubles, but when action sequences (that are few and far in between) lack creativity and imagination, the film really disappoints.

""Ek Tha Tiger"" is an OK action romance with nice photography. It is regrettable that the filmmakers did little to make its thin story more intriguing.",1368489600,,1202,4.825242718446602

5322389,4,B009EOMNSA,"Action movies are not my favorite genre, but nobody in Hindi film is more watchable in action than Salman.  This was a good movie, but was a little too serious for my taste and lacked the comedy I enjoy - say from Wanted, which is my favorite of Salman's action movies.  Katrina's acting seemed a bit better than usual, so I have to give her credit also for this one.  Still, Salman was the big draw for me.",1357862400,,407,4.1923076923076925

5322392,4,B009EOMNSA,"""Ek Tha Tiger"" is an action packed spy movie about a top secret Indian agent known as Tiger who falls in love with a secret agent from Pakistan.  Salman Khan plays the hero.  Katrina Kaif plays the object of the hero's love.  There is a little singing and dancing, but this is not your typical Bollywood movie.

The movie really is action packed.  There are several fight scenes.  It takes about half the movie for the two main characters to fall in love.  Because they know so much about the Indian and Pakistan secret services, they are chased for much of the second half of the movie.

If you would enjoy a well told, happy, story of the cross of a James Bond movie with Romeo and Juliet then give this movie a try.",1356480000,,718,4.3059701492537314
5322393,2,B009EOMNSA,"From the fact that this movie has done very well at the box office and has had some positive reviews, I feel truly sad for Indian film audiences in that they lack better entertainment options.

I have been very disappointed by the latest batch of ""Bollywood"" movies, but as soon as I saw this movie being available on Netflix, I made myself watch it since I liked what I had seen from the promos and the songs of ""Ek Tha Tiger."" However, as I found out, those were just great marketing ploys and that the movie is nowhere near as good as it's hyped up to be.

The plot has more holes than a rat-infested old house, and the acting and direction are sub-par, at best. An example of the holes in the plot is the romance that develops between the main characters. Tiger meets Zoya, they have some awkward conversations about his age and his not-so-funny jokes, he is shy to ask her out (he's very shy around her despite being a world-class spy?), and after just one date, they both declare that they are very much in love with each other. The characters don't develop and they don't get to know each other, but we are forced to just accept the fact that these two individuals are madly in love and they will go as far as dying and betraying their countries for each other. Despite being a real-life couple, I didn't sense any chemistry between Mr. Khan and Ms. Kaif. Either that chemistry doesn't really exist, or that this film just failed to capture and portray it!

There are more examples of the holey plot points, but as I said, I wouldn't want to waste my time mentioning all of them here. I would just like to end my review with this: If you heard the songs and liked what you heard, you would be right in that the music IS good in this movie. Also, the camera-work is good and I liked the use of different settings and locations. But overall, this is one movie that should have been better written and better directed because all the great music and beautiful locations don't make for a great movie. They might make for good, enjoyable (brief) scenes, but not a whole good movie. Good writing, acting and directing are needed to produce a truly good film and this film, unfortunately, is not one.",1356480000,3,2200,4.413793103448276

5322397,4,B009EOMNSA,"Ahh.. Ek  Tha  Tiger - the long awaited film for me after having enjoyed the CD very much before getting the movie. I wasn't totally, absolutely, out-of-this-world blown away after watching the movie even though Salman was up to expectation  doing his kick-ass cool bit with great screen presence as usual. Katrina was a pleasant surprise to me this time,finally getting to see her stretching some decent acting skills as I've written her off as a fluffy bit of cotton candy in her other movies! Movie started off great with Salman making quite an entrance but it went a bit dull as the story unfolds when they start falling in love. Kabir Khan could have made it more interesting and kick up the tempo along here,but instead it was a bit of a drag until the courting bit was out of the way and the pace went up a few notches when the action resumed. Chemistry between Salman and Katrina is undeniable and I have to remind myself that this is a romance story first and foremost, built around a background of espionage and subterfuge rather than the other way round. If you can get this bit around your head then sit back and enjoy the fantastic sceneries, great song numbers and the euphoria of watching Salman Khan in action. Does this Tiger really roar? It doesn't whimper either.",1351555200,,1282,4.5895196506550215
5322398,4,B009EOMNSA,"I would rate this movie second tier. Very good but not the best. It was a great plot - about half action and about half romance. Both Katrina and Salman handled action and romance scenes equally well. The music video was great, especially Mashallah and Banjaara, but there were not enough songs. I liked the way that they utilized  the music styles  of the localities - Ireland, Cuba and Middle East.

8540640,5,B009EOMNSA,"Never a dull moment in this Hindi love story / action film. It starts off rough to show the character and his line of work; but actually the movie isn't one of those violent sensationalistic films. Based loosely on a true story (it says) really gives substance to this film. Surprisingly, it has quite a few light-hearted moments as it opens further into the film. Both the characters are really loveable in their own way. The unexpected unfolds as we watch.
I only watched this because I've grown quite fond of these two main actors, Salman and Katrina, who have both really gained my respect after seeing many of their films, I decided to give it a try even though I wasn't sure if it was one of those 'macho action films'. Surprisingly, you find that it's most basically a love story with some classically beautiful scenes / moments, which was riveting after a while as it necessarily took on quite dangerous / intelligently-executed maneuvers as the plot develops (especially toward the end) that left me going ""wow, what a story"" by the time it was over.",1513382400,,1059,4.668449197860962
