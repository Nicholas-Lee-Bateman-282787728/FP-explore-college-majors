8133448,1,B000GNOHDC,"I wanted the MOVIE The Young Messiah concerning the life and times of the young Jesus Christ. I am not looking for music. The way it was displayed, it was extremely confusing  concerning the DVD. I don't want Gladys Knight and other singers. The story does NOT have these individuals contained in it. As expected from foreign countries, they are cheating we Americans. IF I purchase ANYTHING from Amazon again, I want a 100% guarantee that I only will be dealing with American suppliers..I have been attempting to submit your 100% refund guarantee.  This is the 3 time that these foreign suppliers have caused me problems.",1496880000,,622,4.8584905660377355

8133451,3,B000GNOHDC,"This was a different type of musical experience, for me. I did enjoy the combination of voices from the different genres. One of the entertainers, featured in this CD, is a family member and it was enjoyable to hear him outside of his usual element.",1354924800,,249,4.555555555555555

It was her best DVD so far, she could sing all the songs even though
her voice is not clear yet.",1320710400,,157,3.388888888888889
8133453,1,B000GNOHDC,"Having been thrilled and uplifted many years ago by the New London Chorale's Young Messiah, I looked forward immensely to this 2006 rendering. I could not have been more disappointed. From the very beginning with Aidan Quinn's pseudo ironic narration this was an out of key production. The Irish Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir were loose and uninspiring and where did they dig up the raucous Visual Ministry Gospel Choir? There are many superb Gospel Choirs in the UK,but this is certainly not one of them. The leads were uninspiring with the exception of the superb Jeffrey Osborne who sadly could not redeem a very poor Show. Chaka Khan in particular was a letdown and epitomised what this production lacked-the sense of worship that this wonderful music by Handel normally brings. The choreography in particular was appalling. Don't waste your money.",1262908800,5,855,5.114285714285714
