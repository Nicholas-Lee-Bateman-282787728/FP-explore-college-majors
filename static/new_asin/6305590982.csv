7893663,4,6305590982,"I'm afraid that I disagree with the previous reviewer.  No, it's not quite as good as before, but is good and solid nevertheless.  I say that the fellow that sounds like Mahalia Jackson was great and took all the time necessary.  And I didn't find his singing mediocre.  Nor did I find Beverly Crawford's singing mediocre (who's far beyond mediocre anyways!) or anybody else's singing mediocre.  But they're were some dry spots in between, but it still takes you back to the old days.",1068163200,,484,4.714285714285714
7893664,5,6305590982,"I have seen the previous videos that have been produced at the Azuza gatherings. They have all been wonderful. This one however takes it all a step further. There is such power and sheer electricity in this musical  presentation. This is much more than ""performance"". It is a  display of culture. It is a revelation of the spiritual history of an  oppressed people who have been abased and now lifted up by the hand of God.  As an African American currently living in the Republic of South Africa, I  am excited to have these videos as a part of my collection. I never fail to  show them to my South African friends of the many different peoples of this  nation. I can not only tell them about the worship of God from my cultural  perspective, I can show them, live! This video has not failed to inspire  and bless them all. I highly recommend it. It covers a wide range of the  African American musical spiritual history.",954979200,7,922,4.467065868263473
