4568917,5,B0054JELS4,"I missed some of the seasons due to not being able to get the channel that it came on, so there was alot that I missed, so when I saw that all 8 seasons were available, I knew that I just had to get it. Am so glad that I did, this has been one of my all time favorite shows since it came on the air. I just really hope that they don't ever cancel it---that would be a big mistake for cbs. It seems like they like to take their good shows & just ruin them.
  I hope that this shows keeps going on for a long time. I love Gibbs, Abby, Ziva, Tony, Tim & the rest of the gang. The characters all give their best each & every episode. I think that the producers have picked the right people to play the right parts. Its a fantastic cast.
 I will be able to enjoy all seasons for a very long time. They will get watched & watched often. If you haven't gotten this collection of series then you really should get it. :-)",1317513600,16,913,3.871657754010695

4568919,5,B0054JELS4,I love the series.  The acting and writing are superb along with the character fit.  A little pricey but worth it not to have the show interrupted with inane commercials.  I won't buy season 10 or 11 since Bishop was introduced.  Not the actress but the writing and the character portrayal fell way short.  It seems like they are trying to kill off the show.,1434585600,,358,4.446153846153846

4568921,5,B0054JELS4,"The rating is for the series itself. NCIS, if you haven't heard, is and has been the #1 drama on TV for ages, and with good reason. The cast and their chemistry are superb, the individual episodes and story arcs and engaging, and they always, always win. It's great mental popcorn.

The product itself is fine, standard DVDs in set boxes. Nothing spectacular, but no flaws either.",1425513600,,380,4.6716417910447765

4568932,3,B0054JELS4,"UPDATED REVIEW 2/26/2014.  HA, another Bishop sighting last night.  I think they were trying to show her character had some defense skills.  But for real, both Kate and Ziva would have had her on the ground in 5 seconds.  The came the bumbling investigation for truck accident.  DA.  One point of this episode, it would be an easy out for the character with the shooting.  Sad but true.  We have had 10 out standing seasons of NCIS.  I fear we will see the decay in season 11.  Maybe a decade is long enough.  Updated Review 2/24/2014.  Just finished watching the 2/18/2014 episode and as usual, it was quality NCIS.  No one sitting on the desks or on the floor.  Just the 3 person team, minus Ziva, defending the free world.  Thanks for the re-run.  Updated Review 2/11/2014.  What could be the last ""A+"" NCIS show was aired tonight with a Ziva sighting?  Tony did look like a bum for a while, but he finally found a shaver.  I suppose we will be back to the ""C+"" rated shows soon with Bishop.  Too bad the producers had to contaminate the show.",1398988800,,1046,4.405263157894737
4568933,1,B0054JELS4,I love the NCIS series. That is NOT the problem. The problem is the quality of the DVD. It is NOT good at all. One DVD was missing one of the shows. Other DVD's have many places where the picture jumps. I believe that they were recorded on second hand DVD's. I was truly disappointed in the quality of the videos.,1398643200,,313,4.147540983606557

4568955,5,B0054JELS4,"My Dad once said It's a damn good actor or actress that can make you love them or hate them (Characters). NCIS Has characters you will love enough to actually be depressed when they are lost all the way to characters you absolutely cheer when they get theirs. Good story lines, great casting, compelling characters skillfully portrayed.

There were a few politically correct episodes that were a let down. Thankfully, they were very few. There were some tendencies of some characters that are more comic book than anything approaching reality (Who can ingest that much caffeine? Really!) I'm glad I bought the disc set. I would have been bonkers waiting a week (Or season) to find out what happens next.

Our purchase of NCIS season 1-8 occurred in June 2012 through this venue. Due to changes in our life we were not able to start viewing the collection until fall/winter. When we started to view Season 6 the following occurred: Disc 1 all episodes played fine. Disc 2 through 6 did not show image or sound. Needless to say we feel we have been taken. I am concerned that the remaining seasons are not of a high quality. We are most unsure of ordering successive season episodes through this venue again. We cannot assign a star as half of the product is good, part is not, and the remaining has not been viewed. From what I have read there seems to be no solution offered now.

4568970,3,B0054JELS4,"I really liked the season one disks until I got to the last disk. The last episode on disk 3 had some skipping in it. I removed the disk and examined it for dirt and obvious damage. The disk was totally clean.  So I think that disk has a bad transfer. I'll be watching them in sequence to look for more.  The few drop outs in disk 3 season 1 is not too bad but if more skip I'll be returning them.

Update: unfortunately I've gotten up to season 7 in the set and I've found more bad transfers. Basically the defect is in the polycarbonate material and for some reason tends to be azimuthal and not radial. If you flip it over and have the same issue, the plastic looks uneven and distorted and the data layer is a slightly different color.
This is the worst kind of damage to the disk since it's hard for the player to get past it. Radial errors only occur a short moment per rotation and the player can hide them. I waited too long to return mine, the amazon return page says it's too late for me.",1357948800,,998,4.107692307692307

I had purchased a Sony Blu-Ray player hoping to use it to stream Netflix from my computer, but the Blu-Ray player I bought does not support CC. Closed captioning is different from subtitles (like foreign movies have). CC is for people who are hard of hearing, as I am, and need CC to enjoy programs. Many of Netflix's movies have CC available, but It appears from what I've read that the Blu-Ray player you are using also has to support CC and many don't. I cancelled Netflix until I am able to determine which Blu-Ray player to buy. The website [...] lists some possibilities and also says that Xboxes can show movies and DVDs with CC.

If you know for sure which makes and models of wireless Blu-Ray players have the CC feature, please post this info as I would like to sign up for Netflix again to get movies.",1353715200,,917,4.524096385542169

4568990,1,B0054JELS4,"I ordered the 1-8 set through a non-Amazon seller. These were advertised as in new condition, but upon arrival, it was clear these were knock-offs. The print quality of the dvd packaging and insert was poor, like as from a 15 year old inkjet printer on draft mode. The discs themselves appeared to all be factory pressed with silkscreen/full color printing/artwork. However, the episodes/content of the discs were remastered to fit (lessened quality) on a single DVD layer AND to include 'engrish' and Chinese subtitles. I verified the remastering by ordering a disc through Netflix to check contents...no Chinese subtitles and dual layer DVD.

I reported this to AMAZON and contacted the seller for a full refund. It's a fantastic series, but just make sure you are getting these through a legitimate party to ensure you are getting what you are paying for and that you don't have any of the playback issues reported by other users.",1342569600,14,933,4.942675159235669

Season 4 is still my favorite :-P  I still hope they outlast JAG but I think when they do go out, they gotta go out big like someone would have to die to end this show.

i bought the set which contained seasons 1-8 but this goes for all the seasons separate or otherwise.  from the first episode through the season 8 this show has been consistently well written, acted and produced & has had very few episodes that were below average.  i haven't season any of season 9 which is currently airing now but i can tell you this show is always great and never disappoints.  these dvd sets are all pretty much designed and set up the same with the exception of season 7 which the case is slightly different.  the average amount of extras you normally see on dvds.  the dvd menus are easy to navigate but they are slightly better as the seasons came out.",1334448000,,718,4.51937984496124

Last year, my wife started watching the re-runs and was a little confused (they are almost never in any particular order) so I suggested that we get the set.  Well, she bought me season one and when we finished watching that (in less than one month) she said, ""What am I going to do now - I can't go back to watching the re-runs"" (I'm sure she would if she had to).  I ordered the complete set (Seasons 1-8) and she was happy when they arrived.  Now, when it is not nice outside, we can continue watching.",1333497600,,607,4.252173913043478

Lucky me! One day this was the Deal of the Day! I snapped it up and gave it to him for his birthday.  I know I will have to buy the next season soon, but the price I paid for this was astounding, so the savings will be applied to the upcoming seasons as they are released. The acting is wonderful, and I even  spend a few minutes catching some viewing.  The quality of production of the DVDs is top grade, with each season in its own case, with notes of the show, including original air date, a brief synopsis, commentary from cast members, subtitles and optimized for today's larger TV screens.

Mark Harmon is a revelation as Gibbs, the supporting cast is an ansemble of very good actors who compliment each other in the most dramatic, sometimes quirky, sometimes hilarious ways. David McCallum is still sexy while having an acidic, tonque in cheek sense of humor. My only quibble with the cast is Tony DiNozzo (as protrayed by Michael Weatherly).

I've cleaned the discs, cleaned the disc player with one of those DVD discs with the small microscopic brushes, but they still have problems.  Of the five players we have in the house, those discs do not play on a Samsung Blu-Ray player (with updated firmware) and a Sony Blu-Ray player.  Since I ordered the series early for Christmas, I missed the ""window"" for returning them, so, buyer beware of this issue.

NOTE:  I noticed that Amazon had this same special a few days ago (May 2012).  I would suggest that anyone buying the set play all of the discs ASAP, and return the set if any do not load correctly.

I had forgotten how much Tony and Kate bothered me with their ridiculous bickering and banter. Surprised when I re-watched to find out the pain is over after the first two seasons, felt longer in real time as I watched over the years. This next issue was inserting Lauren Holly as Gibbs old girlfriend and now Superior as The Director at NCIS. Her stiff acting and delivery was another hurdle to jump. Pointless to the weekly plots, she constantly intimates their past  ""sexual"" relationship. We all know Gibbs is a very attractive, mysterious man with only one true love and three mystery ex-wives that followed. Thankfully, Holly too was gone... The cast headed by Mark Harmon, David McCallum, Cote de Pablo, Pauley Perrette, Sean Murray, and even the irritating Michael Weatherly are the recipe of great series TV.

8456751,1,B0054JELS4,"I love NCIS, but suspect this product may have been bootlegged because the quality is so poor. Almost none of the commentaries work, and several special features listed in the menu don't appear to be there either. Some of the disks skip or don't load properly. Unfortunately I didn't play them soon enough to return them, and the product is no longer available.  I don't recommend buying from this seller.",1453766400,,405,4.785714285714286
