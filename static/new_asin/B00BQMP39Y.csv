8572715,2,B00BQMP39Y,"I picked this up cheap just to see DeForest Kelley in his pre-Star Trek days, and for that purpose, it was moderately successful. Unfortunately the movie itself is just wall-to-wall clap-trap about the importance of God in your life. The message was not for me, but De Kelley will always be a favorite of mine.",1487548800,,310,4.654545454545454
