8078798,5,B000AL6XWI,"First I have to say that to see a review criticizing(sorry my friend no offense) real footage in any documentary and referencing this series to be of no entertainment value is just sad and also is giving this great series a very very bad name...First off besides the black and white footage which is of the most importance to me because those are the actual men you see dieing in front of your eyes for this country...Well anyway all else aside they all have real veterans and actual recreations of the battles themselves, which I'm not a huge fan of recreations at all but to see the veterans tell you what they went through including very detailed information on strategy to take each objective is just amazing...You see the feeling in their eyes as they tell you how they lost their brothers yet had to fight on and take an objective even though the unit may have lost 3 of 4 men just to take a pillbox..If you want history and realism then this is a series and a very informative tool on WW2, but if you want entertainment and not fact go rent a movie",1322870400,2,1055,4.387755102040816
8078799,3,B000AL6XWI,"Then this DVD is for you. Not a lot of fluff here. They pretty much used real footage and compiled it as a documentary. To me it was a bit on the boring side. I can only take so much old black and white footage with dry narration before I begin to lose interest. It is good as a tool for knowledge, it is poor as a piece of entertainment, hence the ""ok"" rating.",1178841600,2,361,3.891891891891892
8078800,5,B000AL6XWI,"If you and your sweetie have a hankering to sit down to a Friday night horror movie, Mr. Hell is a must for your list. It's not so bloody that  it'll turn your date off, but scary enough to keep her jumping into your arms. And you might jump into her arms as well, if you are like me, who is spooked by threats to your eyes. This is classic Steven KIng territory, picking phobias most of us have. I won't give away the plot, except to say it involves stealing souls via plucked out eyes. But I will say it has some of the funniest scenes I've encountered in horror movies - where humor is a must. For example: when the bad guy bends over a sink washing out stollen eyeballs while humming, ""Three Blind Mice."" Like the very best ""grindhouse"" features, Mr. Hell features super writing and clever dialogue that lifts the film up to the very top of its genre.",1177545600,2,855,4.245398773006135
8078801,1,B000AL6XWI,"Sound is so bad, of such poor quality that this film should be sub-titled.  Only able to hear about 2/3 of the film.  I'm going to return mine to Amazon for a refund.  Do not buy it!",1151452800,,182,3.864864864864865
8078802,5,B000AL6XWI,"This is an entertaining movie! The title is clever and the plot line was good for this genre of movie. This one has something for just about everyone...scares, action, gore, and humor mixed in. I was also surprised by the quality of the stunts...falls, fire, explosions, fights...that rival much larger budget movies.
NOTE ABOUT THE CAST Contrary to the previous reviewer, Tina Cohen is not the lead. The lead is veteran actress Tracy Scoggins, supported by Pavan Grover and Danny Kamin. If he had paid attention, Tina Cohen was far down on the credits!",1146614400,2,553,4.8936170212765955
8078803,1,B000AL6XWI,"The plot, what there is of it, concerns a ""secret"" bio weapons lab where the head doctor had been killed some years earlier by a supernatural serial killer named Mr. Hell who steals peoples souls by removing their eyes.  Now some 15 years later the doctor's daughter has returned to the lab only to find that the killer is still there as well.  Add to that there is a sub-plot about some mercenaries who are searching the lab for a deadly bacteria formula ala Resident Evil.  Ok...It's really hard to take seriously a film called ""Mr. Hell"" so it's got one strike against it right from the word go.  This is one of those films where it's the very first movie for much of the cast.  This, of course, is yet another bad sign.  In fact the lead actress Tina Cohen doubles as set decorator!  Really there is little redeeming about the film.  I supposed the basic plot was OK, but then again, the basic premise is usually pretty good in most films, it's the execution of the plot where many low-budget horror films normally fail and ""Mr. Hell"" is no different.  The acting is terrible...the delivery is stunted and the scripting is no better.  The special effects aren't bad for what they had to work with but that may be about the only positive thing I can say.  Just terrible on every level and yet another low-budget horror piece of junk clogging the rental shelves.  Avoid!",1146182400,,1372,4.510121457489879
