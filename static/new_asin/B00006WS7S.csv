7973311,1,B00006WS7S,"Perfect... if you've been living under a rock. Extremely disappointing, basic and just plain boring.  I runed it twice because I could not believe that was it, I though maybe my DVD had skipped or something.

I though it would give information on tableware and how to use it: none.

I though it would show beautiful table settings: none -except for a shot of a pinecone place card holder...dah!

As for working with a caterer, she actually refers you, in all seriousness, to the phone book!

I'M SO UPSET I SPENT ACTUAL $$ ON THIS!",1157587200,10,531,4.5473684210526315
7973312,5,B00006WS7S,"This beautifully filmed video picks up where Ms. Kern's first video, ""American Dining & Entertaining Etiquette; Manners for the Table,"" leaves off.  In this video, not only is actual food on the plates so Ms. Kern can show us how to eat our food but we are also informed how the waiters, or in this case, her caterers are to serve the meal properly.
One of my pet peeves when I am dining out at a restaurant is that the waiter will start taking plates from the table before everyone at the table has finished.  Ms. Kern says that is a definite , ""No, no!""
She also states that the water that is served at the table should be chilled but that no ice cubes should be added.  This is a new one on me but I like that idea because I have occasionally spilled water on my dress when the water glass is so loaded with ice cubes.  Take note waiters!!!  No ice cubes!
This video is as helpful and informative as Ms. Kern's first video.  I hope she will make more videos and perhaps even publish some books.  I enjoyed seeing her on the new NBC daytime reality show, ""Starting Over,"" as well as on the PBS show, ""For Your Home."" I look forward to seeing her on other shows in 2004.  I heard that she will be on the ""Emeril live!"" show and perhaps even have her own show.  I hope so; we need more etiquette in this world.",1072656000,,1310,4.166666666666667
7973313,5,B00006WS7S,"This video is so helpful for someone like me who grew up in a family where every meal was grab and gobble!  We never sat down to a formal meal, both of my parents worked and they never entertained except in a 'pizzas and beer' kind of way.
Now that I am a professional and live in a lovely home, my husband and I have wanted to entertain our friends but neither of us knew where to begin.  This video will show the viewer how to give a beautiful party in his/her own home.  The party that is depicted is a holiday party but the advice Ms. Kern gives could be applied towards giving any kind of a formal party.
I recommend this video as well as Ms. Kern's other video, ""American Dining & Entertaining Etiquette; Manners for the Table.""  This new DVD goes a step further that her first video in that it shows actual food on the plates and talks about how it should be served to guests.
For Ruth Kern's party, which was the holiday party for her husband's Chicago office staff and their spouses or friends, she hired a full catering staff to help her but this isn't necessary. If you have children or friends who can help take coats, park cars, cook, serve and/or bartend, a full catering service wouldn't be needed.  It would also be less expensive to pay your kids to help and it is always nice to see the couple's children dressed up and helping at a party.  Good training for them too.
I really liked the idea of having a piano player entertain during the dinner and Ms. Kern's recommendation that she play quietly during dinner so that guests can converse is definitely a good one!  How often have you been at a dinner and the band plays so loudly, no one can talk?  Everyone giving any kind of a party should see this video and tell the entertainment to play quietly during the dinner hour!!!!
Congratulations, Ms. Kern, on another beautiful video well done and very helpful!",1062633600,7,1878,4.39193083573487
