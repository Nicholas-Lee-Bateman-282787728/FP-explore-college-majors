8331348,3,B001OSC4B0,The one redeeming value to the movie was the gratuitous sex scenes and bare chested men.  Other than that kind of a yawner.,1378339200,,123,4.3478260869565215

8331350,1,B001OSC4B0,"For some reason, I seem to remember liking David DeCoteau's ""Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-Rama"", but I suppose ""like"" is a relative term, considering the cheesiness and camp factor of that low-budget endeavor, and too, it was the eighties, for whatever that's worth.  I believe DeCoteau is also responsible for at least one of the films in the ""Puppet Master"" series, some of which I actually liked, as well.  Aside from these films, I can't swear that I've ever seen another movie from this director, that is, until I came across his abomination of Edgar Allen Poe's classic, ""The Raven"".  What can I say, I liked the cover and had the idea that even if the story wasn't that great, there existed the possibility that there would be copious nudity. Besides, the idea of a gay take on Poe intrigued me so I ordered it from Amazon.  Well, let me just say that, as the title of this review states, Poe must be turning in his grave.  There have been dozens of movies (of varying quality) taken from Poe's work, the best of which came, arguably, from veteran B-movie director, Roger Corman.  The worst, also arguably, came from Mr. Corman.  Until now.  All else pales in comparison to Mr. DeCoteau's atrocity.

The main thing you should know is that about the only thing that this movie has in common with Poe's work is the title, and a narrator reciting the poem from a record player.  There are a group of nubile young men and one young woman who arrive at a country estate to have a party.  The spoiled brat who seems to be in charge of the shenanigans is named Roderick (as in Usher, from a completely different work by Poe). There's also a sinister figure dressed in black and wearing a raven's mask who shows up at the house for some discreet butchery, which goes completely unnoticed by the clueless cast, even as their group dwindles.  None of the boys seem to be too interested in the lone female amongst them--they're all too busy trying to get into each other's designer underwear.  Though not really because it's all a tease.  There's no real skin on display, at least not enough to generate any interest, and the characters are all so unlikeable, their dialogue so banal and boring, that when the killer starts picking them off, you wonder what took him so long. The murders themselves are tame compared to most other films of this genre, and the suspense is virtually non-existant.

I really hated this movie and actually forced myself to sit through it twice (though not in the same week) just to make sure it was as bad as I thought.  The second time, it actually seemed worse, and also endless. Adult film director Michael Lucas upended film classics ""Dangerous Liasons"" and ""La Dolce Vita"" and made them into modern gay porno classics.  Maybe that's what DeCoteau should have done with ""The Raven"" (and probably ""The Pit & the Pendulum"", which I refuse to see).  It couldn't be any more boring than this mess.",1334448000,,2933,4.629343629343629
8331351,5,B001OSC4B0,"I am not a particular fan of horror, but the Poe basis of this movie was enough for me to give it a try.  Great music, cute bodies, acceptable ""gore"", and a twisted plot.  In fact, this first foray into David Decoteau's films was rewarding enough for me to order his other Poe-based movies:  Pit And The Pendulum, and Fall Of The House of Usher.  One question: is Pembroke in the pool and Pembroke watching the silent film the same actor??",1315180800,,439,4.382716049382716
8331352,2,B001OSC4B0,"First of all, not every film pleases everyone.  That being said I did not like it as much as some other films I've seen.  Let's just say it was not my cup of tea and leave it at that.",1249430400,,183,3.6666666666666665
8331353,1,B001OSC4B0,What an awful horror flim that seemd to go no where. The acting is so bad and the plot is silly.,1243468800,,96,3.619047619047619
8331354,5,B001OSC4B0,"As always, director David DeCoteau delivers a beautiful looking, highly imaginative film.  This one is a bit more subdued than usual with an economy of camera momvement and few flash cuts or editing tricks.  Instead of the ever swaying/tilting camera angles David has used so frequently in his recent films, we are given strategically placed actors in static shots that create stunning tableaux.  This film at times is more like flipping through a photo album than watching a motion picture.  The effect is gorgeous and appropriate for the story.  The film features music by Richard Band and Full Moon fans will recognize many of his signature melodies in this film.  It works beautifully.  /  The cast is somewhat less GQ than the usual group of actors in a DeCoteau film and I found that to be a welcome change.  /  The script by longtime Decoteau collaborator Mathew Jason Walsh is fairly complex (I'm not sure what the Druids had to do with all this but somehow they were mentioned) and the use of the Poe poem and the Raven motif is quite clever. / The film was shot on Super16 and at times looks a little grainy but again, I thought this was appropriate for the material.  There are a few moments of poor ADR work but they don't distract too much.  /  As the story moves back and forth between present day and the past, a beautiful sepia tone is used to distingish the time periods. / The DVD includes an informative director/producer commentary track and a short photo gallery. The transfer looks to be faithful to the source material and the 5.1 soundtrack is sparkling (Richard Band's music has never sounded better).  All in all this is a wonderful, wildly erotic, elegant little masterpiece from one of the most innovative and talented independent directors working today.",1242086400,5,1783,4.746753246753247
8331355,4,B001OSC4B0,"David,  MUCH BETTER
production values were great. there are some really good actors in south africa. nice bodies, but still a little to quick to kill them off. not near enough viewing time, but overall this was good.",1240272000,4,216,4.684210526315789
