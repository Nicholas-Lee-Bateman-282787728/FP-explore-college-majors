8447915,5,B004Y4RM9U,"Episodes 193 to 224 feature on this boxset which sees the end of one of the most popular charcters in the series Vera Bennett (played by Fiona Spence). The set also features numerous extras with Fiona introducing several episodes and reminiscing on her era on the show.
Vera (nicknamed Vinegar Tits by the inhabitants of Wentworth) falls in and out of love, applies for a prison governorship, gets held at gunpoint, gets shot at, sobs her heart out to Meg Morris (Elspeth Ballantyne) and overhears reminders of what her colleagues and the prisoners really think of her. Elsewhere we experience Bea Smith (Val Lehman) at the hands of Officer Roberts (the late Gerda Nicolson who will appear in volume 12 onwards as a different character) as she is transferred to Barnhurst. Here we also meet Tracey Morris (Sue Devine) once again and we are introduced to Marie Winter (Maggie Millar). Another old face Mum Brooks (Mary Ward) reappears on the scene. Judy Bryant's (Betty Bobbitt) past (Susannah Fowle) reappears at Wentworth too. The ex-wife of new prison officer Terry Harrison (Brian Hannan) turns up in Wentworth and then she's soon out and gone, for good! Jim Fletcher (Gerard Maguire) is governor following Erica Davidson's (Patsy King) time away from the prison. The women also start getting fit in order to help out new prisoner Michelle Parkes (Nina Landis). Michelle herself finds herself in the need of help from Amelia Humber (Myrtle Woods). Lizzie Birdsworth (Sheila Florance) becomes engaged to Colleen Powell's (Judith McGrath) neighbour Sid (Edward Hepple). We also meet the snooty Alison Page (Fay Kelton) who has trouble adjusting to life behind bars.
This set features episodes first screened in Australia between May and September 1981.
Enjoy the last of Vera! Apart from the recap in episode 225 and a brief flashback of her in an episode in the 500's that's Vera done!
