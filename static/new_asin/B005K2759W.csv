Seen to be Set in modern-day New Delhi in India, it tells the story of a poor Autorickshaw driver, 'Amal Kumar' portrayed by Rupinder Nagra a less known actor from Canada. The movie is actually an emotionally rewarding  drama that centers around a poor autorickshaw driver, 'Amal' who is shown as hardworking sweet-natured autorickshaw driver who charges customer by the fare meter accurately.

There is the lady store merchant character by name 'Pooja' protrayed by Koel Purie who has also acted in a friendly and peaceable manner complimenting the righteousness depicted by the poor autorickshaw driver. I think Koel acted nicely. Rupinder's performance is also very good. The movie is also centered around G.K. Jayaram Played by none other than Naseeruddin Shah who is shown as old man who has been wandering the streets of New Delhi searching for an honest man. While Naseeruddin Shah's presence in the movie is short but as usual his acting is always very good.

Without giving out too much of the story, I can tell you that when G.K. Jayaram meets Amal the story unfolds and rest of the movie shows that Amal's hardworking righteousness nature will help him achieve all his little goals in life. A beautiful story and drama.

Rating it respectfully with four stars!",1528761600,,1447,4.893877551020408

8476416,5,B005K2759W,"Amazon.com customers should know that Amal is available at Amazon.ca in zone 1 format. It is in fact a joint Indian and Canadian film. It is very strange that at the moment Amazon/com indicates that it is only available as an Australian import in PAL. So I put my review here as a service to those who might otherwise miss this interesting film because they only have an American DVD player. And what you want to know about most is the film.

Good solid foreign film. Interesting side of New Dehli. It keeps you guessing. In the end it ties together nicely with only a little soul searching. The extras are not bad and are worth watching. Amal may seem bland, but the extras assure us that this aspect of him is not unusual in India where people may focus very closely on survival.

Give it a try if only for a glimpse of the less glamorous and less exotic side of India. But also a story with interesting angles to ponder.
