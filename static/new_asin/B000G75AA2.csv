8129245,4,B000G75AA2,"This movie is in Spanish with no subtitles and utilizes a plot device used in many Mexican comedies filmed in the 1980's. It involves three or four story lines running at the same time. Each story line involves its own set of characters and none of these groups of characters ever meet anyone in the other story lines. It's difficult to determine which one is the main plot because most of them are given equal time throughout the movie. The only common thread tying these different plots together is that each subplot begins in a nightclub called ""LAS CARINOSAS"" and moves on from there. Various musical acts are performed at the nightclub as the camera jumps back and forth among the different comedic story lines.

  The movie contains tons of frontal female nudity from the chorus girls' dressing room as well as from each of the leading ladies in each individual story line.

  ""A well to do architect (Jorge Rivero) impersonates a poor man in  order to win the love of a night club entertainer (Isela Vega).""

  "" A beautiful woman (Sasha Montenegro) fools around with another man (Rafael Inclan) because her husband ignores her.""

  ""  A character resembling Lou Costello acts silly throughout the movie with Carmen Salinas.""

The visual quality of the DVD is very good but the comedy is a little dated and sophomoric. The only redeeming quality (for the guys)is the numerous times the actresses walk around absolutely, totally naked. (Hence the 4 stars.)",1178928000,19,1462,4.838709677419355
