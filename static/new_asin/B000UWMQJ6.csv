8215331,5,B000UWMQJ6,"Great documentary with some re-enactments spliced in with actual audio and visual recordings from radio and TV news broadcasts about  the super cell outbreak that devastated Xenia, Ohio as well as Brandenburg and Louisville, Ky and Madison, Indiana (among other places). However, I must say that the date on the title is incorrect as the super cell outbreak took place on April 3, 1974 and not 1978 as the title suggests.  This a manufactured on demand DVD-R!",1391644800,,459,4.9480519480519485
8215332,5,B000UWMQJ6,This was a very good depiction of the tornadoes in 1978. We lived close to Xenia in 1978 and saw some of the devastation.,1359331200,,121,4.083333333333333
8215333,5,B000UWMQJ6,"This is a great piece of work regarding the April 3, 1974 ""Super Outbreak"" of tornadoes and severe weather which struck many states, but hit Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Alabama quite hard.  In fact, this DVD highlights Xenia, Ohio, Brandenburg, Kentucky, and Limestone County, Alabama.

It is done in narrative form interspersed with victims of the tragedy speaking in their own words about their experiences.  One of the major heroes of the day was weatherman Gil Whitney of WHIO-7 in Dayton who accurately alerted the town of Xenia about the approaching tornado.  I only wish they had given some more time to him and the bulletins he issued.  Another hero was Bob Stewart, the Xenia, Ohio, city manager whose quick thinking and organizational skills helped pick up the broken and half demolished town and start the long rebuilding process.

This is a re-enactment but a very good one. If you are interested in weather or weather-related events, you should get this.

P.S. (One thing to note is that this DVD runs about 20-25 minutes long. Still, it is very interesting.)",1255219200,4,1073,4.927777777777778
