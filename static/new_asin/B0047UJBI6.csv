This Has to be the worst garbage all around I've seen in at least a year!! I gave it a full half hour of viewing before I couldn't take it anymore and turned it off. In the first half hour NOTHING happened. No tension, nothing really interesting, etc. I could tell the writer, director, actors, producer were trying to build up to something but what I don't know.

4285515,4,B0047UJBI6,"The British films about gangsters, have their own profile. The last giant film I remember is from 1980, ""The long good Friday"" that somehow represented the British answer to ""The Godfather"".

In this opportunity, we assist to the tragedy of a decadent and crumbling empire that is about to end, and how the wild instinct of preservation and survival simply ignores (like in most of cases happen) transforms this wealthy clan in a huge bloody swamp.

Filmed according the rules of cinema verite, still accent the anguish and the inner demons that nestle beneath their souls.

Good film but never a great one!",1313193600,2,607,4.87378640776699
4285516,1,B0047UJBI6,"Question: What do you get when you take a Guy Ritchie type crime story with the pacing of a Jim Jarmusch film and have it directed by Kevin Smith?

Answer: You a get film about a bunch of criminal Brits who sit around the house talking about stuff.

However, despite the talent of the influence and the quote on the DVD cover proclaiming the film to be ""profanely funny,"" Down Terrace is a boring blunder that fails almost every step of the way.

It's also worth noting that the director contact me regarding my review. Despite my bad review he was a very nice guy.",1306108800,3,599,4.321428571428571
4285517,4,B0047UJBI6,"DOWN TERRACE is a real treat:  An understated British gangster flick mixing hilarious dysfunctional family drama with pitch-black crime movie brutality.  Before discussing content, it must be noted that the accompanying music track is ridiculously amazing.  The fact that no soundtrack recording has been released saddens more than the ultra-grim tale itself.  When Bob Hill's character strums his acoustic to a hearty rendition of ""Spanish Ladies,"" for a moment, you think he's a nice guy.  For a moment.  Starring a real-life father and son, DT will make you feel better about any minor grievance within the family unit.  Actually, ""Dysfunctional"" is too kind a description for directly to HELL is where these folks are a-goin'.

Our story begins with Bill and Karl just released from a brief jail detention. A jolly welcome home party ensues, but it's easy to tell that darkness is fast approaching.  Apparently, Bill and Karl run a nightclub, but only as a cover for their underworld crime syndicate division.  The old reliable ""Snitch In Our Midst"" plot device is revealed to be the reason for the jail time.  As our anti-heroes seek the traitor, you will not believe the behavior on display.

Violent yet minimally bloody, DOWN TERRACE could be the quietest Hooligan cinema ever imagined.  The emotional wallop, however, will leave you knackered.",1303084800,3,1352,5.146788990825688
4285518,3,B0047UJBI6,"Think Coen Brothers meets a KEN LOACH movie and you'll get the jist. Small budget but Great Acting finds this quirky British story of a Father & Son just out of a short stint in Jail. Someone close to them & their nefarious family business has ratted them out to the police. The family's downward spiral of paranoia adds to an ever increasing body count. Real Life Father & Son actors are fabulous. Mom is outstanding & a regular in several of Edgar Wright TV & Movie projects. Docked 1-Star 'cuz the tone's not even throughout the film. Instead of balancing the Comedy w/Drama...The 1st hour of film has more funny offbeat humor while the last 20 or 30 mins offer very little brevity. A couple of neat turns you don't see coming. Worth a rent if you like quirky, talky British Crime Comedy/Dramas. Definitely lighter but along the same lines as Sexy Beast, Bronson or 40 inch Chest.",1302480000,,883,4.559748427672956

8418355,2,B0047UJBI6,"If this is comedy it is as black as it gets as I never got a single chuckle out of it. It is well acted and shot in clever way. It would have been better if this story that runs like a train wreck had a little light along the tunnel so that I might at least be able to say I saw something interesting. I am not anti violence in movies and I love stories that give unique perspectives about hard topics, but Down Terrace is like your hearing a story told by several drugged people through a wall.  Without much ado the characters come to the conclusion to kill each other and seemingly with little care about the corpse, the neighbors, or the police for that matter. I backed up the movie to see if I had missed something, but had not. A lot is left out and yet there is only one of what I could call a clever surprise that happens at the end.",1482796800,,842,4.011904761904762

8418360,4,B0047UJBI6,"Set in a mundane suburban area of Kent, DOWN TERRACE is the blackest of black comedies involving a family headed by Bill (Robin Hill) who in collaboration with his son Karl (Robin Hill) tries to discover the identity of an informant who shopped them to the police and thereby confined them to prison.  There are several suspects among their intimate group, notably Eric (David Schaal), Garvey (Tony Way), and Councillor Berman (Mark Garvey).  Meanwhile Eric and his wife Maggie (Julia Deakin) object to Karl's continuing relationship with Valda (Kerry Peacock).

Ably performed in semi-improvised style by a first-rate cast, Ben Wheatley's film emphasizes the culture of mistrust that permeates this so-called close network of criminals.  Although professing loyalty to one another through frequent hugs and epithets (""You know I love you""), it's clear that no one really can rely on anyone else to be truthful either in their behavior or their responses to one another.  This is a dog-eat-dog community in which only the fittest can survive.  There are some gory moments in the film, but they are handled with such panache that we understand Wheatley""s purpose in including them - in a world where 'good' and 'evil' no longer exist, every behavioral move can be seen as absurd, even comic.

Tautly filmed with an astute use of close-up, pans and two-shots in tight spaces, DOWN TERRACE is a low (or perhaps) no-budget piece of work that nonetheless confirms the director's mastery of cinematic form.  Highly recommended.",1422403200,,1521,5.129554655870446
8418361,5,B0047UJBI6,This a gritty and darkly humorous crime drama that delivers its body blows with the force of a Greek tragedy. It makes Goodfellas look like My Blue Heaven.

8418362,3,B0047UJBI6,"Down Terrace (Ben Wheatley, 2009)

Netflix, in their inimitable quest for complete inaccuracy, lists Down Terrace as a comedy. If you can see, say, The Homecoming as a comedy, maybe. (I was going to use Endgame, but there's enough farce in there that it actually does work as a comedy.) I found it one of the bleakest movies I have seen so far this year, a movie so far removed from the comedy world that I'm not even sure they inhabit the same planet. This is a movie about, as another review of the film that I read recently put it so very well, unlikable people doing unlikable things; that is as good a summary as anything I could come up with.

While the film is essentially plotless, I'll go with Netflix's summary, since that is at least a subplot here, but with a whole lot of clarification. Bill and Karl (real-life father-and-son team, and Wheatley regulars, Robert and Robin Hill) are small-time gangsters, Bill a drug dealer and Karl a runner, who have just narrowly escaped a long prison sentence. Their mole in the home office, David Berman (The World's End's Mark Kemper), tells them from the first time wee see him that somewhere in their organization is a mole who's been telling the police all about their business, as well as providing the coppers with an extensive list of contacts. The movie takes place over the two weeks after the charges have been dismissed. Ostensibly, it is about Bill, Karl, and Bill's wife Maggie (Shaun of the Dead's Julia Deakin) shaking down their friends and acquaintances in order to find out who the informant is, but so little screen time is spent on the actual mystery of the informant's identity that it is, in essence, a subplot at best. There's also a great deal of stuff about Karl and his girlfriend Valda (Kerry Peacock in her only screen appearance to date), pregnant with Karl's child (or is it? Bill is unconvinced throughout the film), who is trying to convince Karl to ditch the criminal life and go straight; Maggie's brother Eric (Mr. Nobody's David Schaal), the organization's enforcer; Bill's obsession with the blues, and his weekly musical get-togethers; Pringle (Kill List's Michael Smiley), an outside wet-work contractor; and a number of other threads, including the entire clan's taste for getting high on their own supply (while the drug in question is never identifiedEric calls it double bubble in an early scenethe most believable speculation I've seen on IMDB is that the entire gang are hooked on Solpadol, which for those of you reading this in America is the British equivalent of Tylenol with codeine).

The good parts about the movie are (a) Wheatley and Hill (Robin, not Robert)'s script, with its strong emphasis on well-drawn and believable characters in almost entirely unrealistic situations and (b) playing spot-the-theme-that-cropped-up-again-in-Kill List. (As if (a) didn't already have you doing so.) Not only is it not a comedy, but after reading that attempt at a synopsis, you might think this is a gangster film in the longstanding British gangster film tradition; not at all, except if you turn your head and squint just right. This is a slice-of-life film that happens to include unsavory characters who occasionally do very violent things. But this is a movie far more interested in the dynamics of this family than it is with the organization to which they all belong. The bad thing about the movie is that almost by definition, any attempt to summarize the movie either by pigeonholing it into a genre or attempting to summarize it in a sentence or two is inevitably going to be a great letdown for people who take those genres and synopses on faith; you are guaranteed to get something very different than you actually got. (Kill List had this same problem, but there it very much felt like subterfuge on Wheatley's part, whereas here it feels far more like Netflix incompetence. (To be fair, every other site on which I've seen a synopsisIMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Mubi, etc.all suffer the same attempt to summarize, and I probably shouldn't be picking specifically on Netflix for this one.) It also, by focusing so obsessively on characters that it almost ignores plot, decides to be a little lax about tying up some of (okay, all of) its loose ends; the viewer will have far more questions after the final frame than after the first ten minutes.  This is not always a bad thing, but they're not the kind of questions that are going to get you over to the pub afterwards involved in impassioned discussion until closing time, they're more okay, that scene ended up being irrelevant, let's not follow it up. So all that saidif you liked Kill List (I still haven't seen Wheatley's other two extant films as of this writing, though I will have seen both by next Sunday morning), it's worth going back and checking this one out to see where Wheatley came from. But watch that one first. ** ",1397692800,,4887,4.792408066429418
