This is the starting point of a careful revenge from the inner depths from her soul against Labourdette and her mother.
The script is overknown. But in hands of Bresson it became in another masterpiece in his career.
Bresson was a man concerned around the huge possibilities of visual expressions; so you may consider all his films as mude films with unnecesary subtitles.
Bresson belongs to a reduced category of giants filmakers such as Dryer, Murnau or Renoir but gifted of poetic atmosphere since the opening sequences of any of his previous or next films.
If you 're really interested in his filmography you'll find out such hidden treasures that you'll convince by yourself that Bresson is not  only enoughly known even today, but he's a genius in the caleidoscopic sense of the word.
The minimalism is a concept that I disagree in Bresson's case. His spiritual concerns hardly may be entitled ; the genius is always contemporean and that is why he escapes to any reduced category.
This film must have been a true revelation in its age. Jean Delanoy for instance won a deserved triumph in Cannes with the Pastoral Symphony, for instance , but you feel that Delanoy is in a lineal level ; he's just a storyteller without the bliss of Bresson.

1828024,3,B000087EY6,"Robert Bresson's second movie DAMES DU BOIS DE BOULOGNE is a precise, minimalist melodrama of revenge and redemption.

Hoping to get a commitment from her long time upper class lover, a high society woman stages a phoney break up. To her shock, her lover agrees.  Filled with jealousy and hate, she manipulates circumstances to get him to fall in love with a pretty but poor cabaret dancer who entertains men on the side (to support her needy family).  The dastardly plan leads to an expected public disgrace.

What is unexpected is the moral descent of one woman and the redemption of a fallen woman. Interesting moral fable and not typical of Bresson's later films.

For specialized tastes and true videophiles.",1053216000,3,713,4.908333333333333

When I first saw this film about ten years ago, it immediately went to the top of my list of best pictures you never heard of. Happily, Les Dames is at least somewhat better known these days, with much of the credit for its increased familiarity going to the present Criterion version. The story itself is pitifully thin: a beautiful society woman plots revenge on a boyfriend who has jilted her for another woman. Never mind that she had already dumped him, sort of. Such are the vagaries of Hell Hath No Fury, and thats basically our story line here.

And for all the multi-textured riches that director Robert Bresson and cinematographer Philippe Agostini tease from such limited material, Les Dames is ultimately about atmosphere and character. Indeed, with one notable exception the stars of the film are its irresistible black and white look and the Paris locales. Speaking of Paris, Id be interested in the films production history. It was released in 1945, only a year after the Liberation, and was apparently filmed at least in part during the Occupation, but theres not the slightest hint of the War.

There are good performances throughout. Though not a particularly memorable actor, Paul Bernard is competent and sympathetic as he glides through the role of the smitten playboy. Cary Grant lite, if you will. The wonderfully luminous Elina Labourdette gives an affecting, understated performance as the virtuous heroine with a shady past. An added bonus is that she performs her dance numbers with convincing, light-footed panache. The character of Agns is depicted as a celebrated nightclub dancer with lots of male suitors. In the context of the movie this may  or may not  be the familiar 1940s euphemism for a prostitute. The story line is a little murky and much is left open to interpretation.

But ultimately the movie belongs to the intense, elegantly sinister Maria Casars as the spiteful Hlne. With her thick, flowing black locks, Madame Grs and Schiaparelli wardrobe (dark tones, please), somnambulist movements and inscrutable features, shes the very embodiment of the noir spider woman. Apparently she was a legend on the Paris stage in the Forties and Fifties but alas made few films, and were the poorer for it.

But is Les Dames film noir? Well, maybe. Theres no crime, strictly speaking, but the maliciousness of the Casars character borders on the criminal. Les Dames also has the requisite smoky look, along with themes of obsession and betrayal, and, crucially, a formidable femme fatale. Then again, one could just as easily describe it as a comedy of manners where drawing room melodrama meets offbeat love story, all done in an eminently Forties style.

Whatever its genre, Les Dames is a terrific film: multilayered, subtle and strangely haunting, with a great cast, score and visuals. One caution: it has a restrained, quintessentially European tone and pacing (i.e. its slow). Thus if your tastes tend to car chases, fiery conflagrations, and brutal hand-to-hand fights, better pass this one by.",1497312000,,3086,5.015625

7979394,5,B000087EY6,"For years, I have heard of Bresson's films; many praises for them, notably from directors like Michael Haneke. I even saw some excerpts of Bresson's movies on the Web like Mouchette and the result impressed me. But I unfortunately never had the chance or opportunity to watch one of his movies. Until I found a copy of ""Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne"", with dialogues written by Jean Cocteau, artist I love and whose collaboration sparked my curiosity. The end result was that I now have a bigger interest to watch Bresson's films, even though I know they differ quite greatly from this one as he never employed actors again; using only non-professionals for the rest of his life.

This movie is an excellent adaptation of a novella contained inside ""Jacques le Fataliste"", an excellent novel of disgression I read at University. The story, set in the forties after the war although the movie was shot during it, concerns an upper class woman who schemes a liaison between Jean, her naive and good-willed ex-lover, and Agns, a cabaret dancer whose mother has led her into a life of prostitution with her male spectators. Of its adaptation, it is important to know that Cocteau improved the dialogues, making them more romantic and emotional than in the original story. But as Truffaut also pinpointed out in a review he wrote, and which Criterion offers inside a leaflet, the major improvement concern Agns, whom Bresson and Cocteau made her simple and innocent; and her dilemmas and pains more accessible to us than in the original novel.

As for Jean-Jacques Grunnenwald, his music is wonderful, dramatic and Bresson uses it very sparingly. Making its presence more powerful for the audience and leaving out any risks for pleonasms in critical scenes. Indeed, Bresson allows the actors, the angles, and lighting the chance to speak for themselves and tell the story; and he does not let too much dialogues overdrown the film. One particular shot I like is the final confrontation between Jean and Hlne as his car constantly encounters Hlne while he tries to drive away from a parking. Her presence and looks tells all of her success with the trap she cast on her ex-lover. Leaving us with a movie with wonderful performances for all the actors. Notably Maria Casars as the manipulative Hlne. By the way, I thought lina Labourdette's dance work was stunning. Both in the bar scene and the apartment; where Grunnenwald music was perfect for the first, splendid for the second.

Criterion did a great job restoring the film. The sound comes out in a Monaural effect, and the images have been restored from the usual scratches, stains, dirts, and such. But it is important to know that some shots may have a green tinge for a few images before they become black-and-white, and some images may have some quick little jumps, grains and other scratches. Some images might even look a little blurry for some scenes or shake a little; though I wonder if it isn't due to some technical difficulties at the time of the film's production. Now let's be clear, Criterion did a wonderful job with their restoration and the movie's comfortable to watch. But I wonder if one day, they might have the chance to find other film rolls of ""Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne"". Ones Criterion could use to offer a sharper restoration of the movie. Either on a new DVD or a Blu-Ray with more bonus features like some deleted scenes or interviews too.

In the end, I was very happy with this movie and encourage anybody to watch this wonderful collaboration between Cocteau and Bresson.",1415836800,2,3558,4.799347471451876
7979395,5,B000087EY6,"LES DAMES DU BOIS DE BOULOGNE, (1945). In this black and white 86 minute classic of French cinema, admired director Robert Bresson follows the cruel machinations of rich and beautiful Parisian socialite Hlne (Mara Casares,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Les-Enfants-Du-Paradis/dp/B000I2IWW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Les Enfants Du Paradis</a>), a femme fatale who decides to destroy her shallow former beau Jean (Paul Bernard) after he admits he has lost interest in her. She is fueled by vengeance as she orchestrates a remarkably expensive scheme to trick Jean into marrying a ""cabaret dancer"" (Elina Labourdette). The film is an updated but reasonably accurate adaptation of the story of Madame de La Pommeraye from 18th century French author Denis Diderot's novel JACQUES LE FATALISTE. Famed French author/filmmaker Jean Cocteau, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-The-Beast-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00007L4I6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and The Beast (The Criterion Collection)</a>, 1946;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orpheus-Criterion-Collection/dp/B005152C82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orpheus (Criterion Collection)</a>, 1949), contributed  the film's lyrical dialog.

This is a classic love triangle, but Bresson, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Man-Escaped/dp/B00C9VAL70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Man Escaped</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pickpocket-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000BB14IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pickpocket (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;), who, early in his career, has not yet fully developed his minimal storytelling style, does show some minimalist touches in  telling  its story, increasing its impact.  All four lead actors -and in his future work, Bresson was seldom to work with professional actors--deliver fully-inhabited performances.  Moreover, the director does seem to have been largely un-minimalist in the film's making. Interiors are well-decorated and luxurious; the women's wardrobes are ample and elegant, attributed to well-known French designers Gres and Schiaparelli. Cinematography, by Philip Agostini (creator of the memorable looks of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essential-Art-House-Le-Jour-se-Lve/dp/B002E01M9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essential Art House: Le Jour se Lve</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rififi-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005A8TX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rififi (The Criterion Collection)</a>), is outstanding: the picture is visually beautiful. Soundtrack, which Bresson would rarely use later,  is by Jean-Jacques Grunenwald. Perhaps most notably, Bresson has also given the film a more-or-less happy Hollywood ending: after the wedding Helene cannot resist telling Jean about his new wife's secret past. But this malicious exposure will be followed by more surprises.

LES DAMES is a brisk and beautiful treatment, by a greatly gifted director, of an old and interesting story. Worth seeing even if you're not particularly a Bressonian, if you've the tolerance for black and white and subtitles.",1379721600,4,3314,8.186111111111112
7979396,5,B000087EY6,"Robert Bresson moved on from using name actors after this 1945 movie.  However this is an excellent movie, a collaboration with Jean Cocteau and based on a story by Denis Diderot.  I've watched it at least ten times and I never regret it.  Maria Casares and Elina Labourdet are so good.  It could've been a Greta Garbo movie as the liner notes state, but it's all Robert Bresson with the tensions of the opulence of Catholicism combined with the sparseness of Calvinism that his Jansenist background suggests.",1313452800,,509,4.816091954022989
7979397,4,B000087EY6,"At the time of writing, there are already 10 reviews of this DVD in the file, so a detailed analysis is unnecessary. Instead, I prefer to critique some of the earlier comments in light of my own perception of the film. Firstly, I could not fault the quality of the transfer, but I did consider the paucity of extras somewhat ungenerous. Secondly, I think that it is pure hyperbole to call this film a ""masterpiece"". Stylistically, it drifts between a period piece and film noire. It is a collaboration between a man of images (Bresson) and a man of words (Cocteau), and it seems that the latter wins out; his dialogue is quite brilliant: full of ideas and insights expressed in a direct and economical manner, although some of it is shaped in set pieces that create the vocal feel of a stage play rather than a movie. For a relative novice, Bresson's contribution is impressive: lean, elegant, austere, and on occasions sensuous, with just the right pacing to keep the tension high while allowing the twists and turns of the plot to sink in. His technical crew do marvellous work, lighting and shading the imagery in an exciting and poetic fashion.

Praise for the actors has been justifiably abundant, but in my view Paul Bernard represents a weak link. His hysterical and effeminate portrayal of the hapless Jean is no match for the steely razor-sharp Helene of Maria Casares, more in the mould of her Death in Orpheus than her Nathalie in Les Enfants du Paradis. But this leads to a very one-sided battle. The literary source of the film ( Diderot) overlaps that of Les Liaisons Dangereuses ( Leclos ). There are clear similarities in the seduction of a young girl planned by a couple of lovers whose affair is going sour, and they are the real protagonists rather than the agent and the object of seduction. The two film versions of the second that I have seen succeeded convincingly because the male characters ( Gerard Phillipe and John Malkovich ) were strong enough actors to stand up to Jeanne Moreau and Glen Close respectively. Not here, where Casares has it all her own way. The final point I want to make is the difficulty in accepting that the angelic Agnes was practicing as a prostitute. No visual evidence to this effect is presented, and her character as revealed to us would seem to rule this out. Why then her deep sense of shame? Were her vaudeville performances alone the cause of such remorse or was simply appearing on stage in Paris in the late 18th Century sufficient to be branded a whore? The modern dress adaptation of the parable conditions us to expect a more contemporary moral code, so that her behaviour appears silly and hysterical by our standards. Bresson and Cocteau should have dealt with this more convincingly. No masterpiece, but a fascinating psychodrama that has some of the characteristics of one.",1308700800,4,2842,4.729838709677419
7979398,5,B000087EY6,"This movie was set up in a way for me to not appreciate it. Based on the anecdotes I read about it how it flopped commerically and critically, I was not interested in seeing this so urgently. But eventually I got around to it and I'm so glad that I did!
I consider this to be one of Bresson's best!

Yes, the ending was sort of lame especially coming from a Bresson film and dialogue writings from Jean Cocteau, but that is simply a minor misstep! Overall, the story is tight and you get great acting performances especially from the thespian who plays the role of Helene.
This movie reminds me of one of those old Hollywood films from the golden age with the exception only that this one has a more European flair which makes the melodrama actually more digestable.

I'd recommend this onee.",1248998400,2,792,4.455172413793103
7979399,5,B000087EY6,"`Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne' was directed in 1945 by: Robert Bresson (Diary Of A Country Priest, 1950; A Man Escaped,1956; Pickpocket, 1959; Au Hasard Balthazzar, 1966) The screenplay was adapted from the Denis Diderot short story `Jacques The Fatalist' by poet, artist and director Jean Cocteau (La Belle Et La Bete, 1946; Orphee, 1949). This seems an odd coupling because their work as directors is in complete contrast and because of the dialogue it makes this film feels more like a Cocteau film. This is however was only Bresson's second film and what would be determined as Bressonian, his lack of theatre and visually austere style, would only be developed in his subsequent the film of the 1950s.

Bresson used actors (he would later use non-professional or `models') in this film the most notable being Maria Caseras (Le Enfants Du Paradis, 1945; Orphee,1949) whom astute critics at the time compared to Joan Crawford who had just starred in `Mildred Pierce' (1945,Curtiz) and the following years `Possessed' (1946, Bernhardt). It is that manipulative femme fatale role that is the defining quality of this, which could be considered, French film noir.

Cinematography was by Philippe Agostini who had shot the now famous poetic realist `La Jour Se Leve' (1939, Carne) a cinematic movement that was instrumental in the development of American film noir. He would later work on `Le Plaisir' (1952, Ophuls) and `Riffifi' (1955, Dassin) both being stylistically brilliant films.

`Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne' may in the end be good Cocteau but not so good Bresson.",1176595200,8,1576,5.077220077220077
7979400,5,B000087EY6,"This film is mesmerizing in its air of mystery and dark passions, done by Bresson obviously under Cocteau influence - the image of Cocteau's Orpheus immediately conjures up, with Maria Casares' dangerous beauty captivating from the first moments...

I love so much that the whole dry and moralistic spirit of the book which is the source of the story - ""Jacques le Fataliste"" by Denis Diderot - is gone. The book would speak at length about religion and virtue, in 18th century fashion, while here Cocteau left only the essence of love - passions of desire, of pursuit of happiness, of jealousy and revenge...

And perhaps the message is that once love is gone, it cannot be won back by evil, and even revenge could boomerang and hurt  the perpetrator.

It is overall an incomparable film.",1137715200,3,789,4.779411764705882

The film seems loose in the gate and therefore the picture is very instable; it's jumping a lot, which is very irritating. Also, there is some noise present in the background.

So although Criterion did clean up the print quite much, this effort is in vain due to the imperfect transfer. I wonder why nobody has noticed this at Criterion? And its a problem which could have been corrected quite easily....

Considering the high price Criterion asks for this title: don't buy it!",1102550400,7,598,4.796116504854369
