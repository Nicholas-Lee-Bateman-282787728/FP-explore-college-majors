1246001,1,B00001PE6J,Congratulations on releasing a game that doesn't work on all blu-ray players.  That's a terrific business decision!,1267574400,,115,5.764705882352941
1246002,5,B00001PE6J,"After being pushed back almost a year from it's original release date, ""Dragon's Lair II: TimeWarp"" FINALLY sees the light of day.  The animation is flawless and is even better than the original arcade version was as far as smoothness and color use.  I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  There are no annoying pauses in between the moves much like ""Dragon's Lair"" and ""Space Ace"".  There's even a ""Director's Cut"" of the final sequence of scenes that can be played as part of the actual game.  Finally for those of us that cannot afford to buy an arcade cabinet of our own, or track down all the necessary equipment (the right laserdisc player model and original laserdisc) to play on our PC's, we too can enjoy this faithful translation of an arcade classic in the comfort of our own homes!  All in all the only bad thing was the loooong delay of a release date.  Way to go Digital Leisure! Oh, and in case you're wondering I am using a 60 GB PS3 to play it and I have no firmware or hardware issues at all.  AAA+++!!!",1246665600,6,1027,4.454545454545454
1246003,5,B00001PE6J,"This is a nice change of pace for a Dragon's Lair sequel. The game play is pretty good if you play this on a Playstation.

Using the TV remote is less fun.

It also has an option where you can just ""watch"" the game.",1197244800,,215,3.8636363636363638
1246004,3,B00001PE6J,"Dragons Lair for the Playstation 2 (PS2) plays ok for a re-hash.

If you _LOVED_ this game back in the 1980's when it came out, then you'll like going down memory lane by playing this game.

If you never played this game, I doubt you'll get much out of it.

I've seen people refer to this as a ""twitch"" game. Meaning that you have to press the button at the RIGHT moment to make your action count. Too early, or too late, and Dirk-the-Daring (your character) will lose a life. Don't get me wrong, a twitch game isn't bad, but when you compare the common actions of modern video games (i.e. moving a character in any direction on screen) to the ""pre-designed scenes"" of Dragons Lair, there isn't any comparison.

For those unaware of the Dragons Lair theme...

  Up until this game, video game graphics were limited to moving a 'sprite' (pac-man character, or spaceship etc) around the screen. Dragons Lair hired Don Bluth (a Senior Animation man from Walt Disney Animation Studios ) to draw/animate short scenes of animation.

  Imagine a cartoon character walking down a path. The animation sequence takes him to a ""decision point"", perhaps a ""Y"" fork in the road. At THAT point, you move the joystick left-right to decide which path the character takes. The animation changes at that point to show you going down in that direction. If it was 'correct' you get by the danger of that scene, and can then continue gameplay. If you choose wrong, the animation changes to show the character being 'killed' by that particular danger.

Forward/Back/Left/Right/Sword, those are the only 'commands', and most decision points only have 2-3 active anyway (i.e. my ""Y"" fork example only uses left/right.

As you can see, by todays standards, this isn't very exciting. But by 1980's standards, it was an entirely new direction for videogames to follow!

I love playing this game for the nostalgia effect (I actually beat the game on 2 lives in the arcade in the 80's!! and I didn't get to use my remaining 3rd life to play again on the same quarter!<frown><smile>)

Compare the gameplay of Dragons Lair, to a popular current game, and the current one has blood/guts/kicks/punches/ etc.

Like I said above, Get this if you like this kind of game.",1152662400,7,2234,4.751295336787565
1246005,5,B00001PE6J,"I purchased the three games (DL, DLII, Space Ace) at Electronics Boutique for [price] each new.  They say ""X-Box Compatible"" and ""Playstsation 2 Compatible"" but there is no difference between these discs and the DVD versions, only the packaging is different.  Can't wait for DL 3-D to come out, and I hear rumors of an animated film in the works?",1027555200,,346,4.75
1246006,5,B00001PE6J,"I've played literally every version of Dragon's Lair in existence (even the old coleco versions). And by far the DVD versions are the best. It still might not be as perfect as the original laser disc version, as far as timing of the moves go, its real close and I found myself just watching the full length movie anyway. I never realized how much of an improvement in animation and detail there was for Lair 2. Each level also has a barrage of moves, sometimes one every second. Excellent job.",996278400,,493,4.488888888888889
1246007,5,B00001PE6J,"OK, let's start by mentioning that there are TWO versions of this DVD.  There is a DVD-ROM version which requires Windows 95/98 to run, and there is THIS version (called DVD-VIDEO) which does NOT require a computer to run.  Both versions are manufactured by Digital Leisure.
Here is the scoop on both versions...
DVD-ROM version:
 -Requires Windows 95/98 to run. (I don't know if it will work with Windows 2000 or Windows Me)
 -Has smoother game play.  From what I have heard from other people, the game play on this version is practically flawless.
 -I don't think that this version has the ""watch"" feature, which lets you view the entire animation without actually playing the game.

DVD-VIDEO Version:
 -Does NOT require a computer to run.
 -When I use this on my Sony DVD player that is hooked to my TV, the game play is painful.  There are 2-3 second gaps between moves that makes the game almost unbearable.  However, when I play this on my computer's DVD drive, the game play is quite good.  There are still gaps between moves, but only about 1/4 of a second or so.
 -Has a ""watch"" feature that lets you view the entire animation without playing it.  This is very cool!
 -Works on MOST DVD players, except some Toshiba models.

WHY I BOUGHT THIS VERSION:
 Even though the game play is better on the DVD-ROM version, I decided to buy the DVD-VIDEO version for a couple of reasons...
 -The ""watch"" feature was important to me.  I wanted the ability to just sit back and take in the whole beautiful animation without having to do sword, left, left, sword, etc.
 -I wanted this purchase to last.  In other words, I didn't want to be forced to buy a new version of this product when I switch my computer system over to Windows 2000 (or whatever Bill Gates comes up with next).

ABOUT THE ACTUAL GAME:
 Think of it as Dragon's Lair meets Alice in Wonderland meets Time Machine.  It is VERY bizzare, but VERY cool.  If you were a fan of the original Dragon's Lair, then you will probably love this.  The animation looks exactly like it did in the arcade.  I am hooked on it.",992390400,23,2074,4.520215633423181
1246008,4,B00001PE6J,"I don't believe this was ever made for the arcade.  It is the sequel to Dragon's Lair which WAS made for the arcade way back in 1983.  The animation is outstanding and while the game is mostly luck, it's fun none  the less.  It even has some nice special features just like movie DVD's.  Enjoy!",960681600,3,294,4.2727272727272725

7914669,4,B00001PE6J,"I need to re-echo my sentiments from my Dragon's Lair blu-ray and Space Ace blu-ray reviews.  Digital Leisure redeemed themselves several times over from the junky DVD version of this game with the blu-ray version of Dragon's Lair II: Timewarp.  Just like the other two games, the 1080p video of this game is nothing short of amazing, the characters and the details in the scenes and level designs just pop and are just beautiful to look at.  The 5.1 channel surround sound is just awesome.  The 2 second pause between moves that plauged the DVD version of this game are gone and even the ""move accepted tone"" (beep) is back.  You do get some of the standard features and extras: new interviews with Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, a watch feature, a watch feature with commentary with Don Bluth and Gary Goldman but new to this game are storyboards from the deleted Pirate Ship scene and you can choose a ""director's cut"" ending that slightly changes the showdown with the evil wizard Mordroc and the ending.  And you can also choose between 5 and infinite lives.

I am playing this game on a Samsung blu-ray home theater model number HT-E5500W and haven't experienced any problems.  I'm not sure why PS3 owners are having issues but the disk plays just fine and is glitch-free on my Samsung blu-ray home theater in a box system.

The reason this game falls short of a 5 star review (and it is just shy, I would give it 4.5 stars) is there is a slight problem with the timing of the moves.  Every move in this game is ""flashed.""  If you played Dragon's Lair, sometimes portions of the room or Dirk's sword would ""flash"" to hint at what the next move was, well every single move in Dragon's Lair II: Timewarp is ""flashed.""  The problem is the move needs to be made just BEFORE the ""flash"" occurs or the split second when the ""flash"" begins.  So if you don't know the next move before you need to make it, you're dead.  This is a little irritating since I finished this game on both DVD and on the outstanding Nintendo Wii version.

This is not a flaw but I do have to warn people that completing Dragon's Lair II: Timewarp is a HUGE undertaking.  In the interview with Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, Don Bluth said that people told him the original Dragon's Lair was too easy so he set out to make Dragon's Lair II: Timewarp harder.  The problem is, he went WAY OVERBOARD!  It takes 312 moves to complete Dragon's Lair II: Timewarp!  Yes, you read that right, 312 moves!  So if you don't have the time to invest in this or you have a low frustration level you might want to skip this game (especially when the moves need to be made a little bit before the ""flashes"" because this is going to cause you to die A LOT and you will have to start the very long scenes over again just to get back to the move you died on to follow the ""flash."")  You might want to watch this game being played on a website I can't mention due to Amazon's restrictions, but you know the one I mean and watch the tremendous number of moves that need to be made to make sure you can invest the time it takes to complete this game.  I am not kidding, this game is super hard!

Other than that one complaint and the sheer number of moves and time that needs to be put into this game to complete it; Dragon's Lair II: Timewarp is very well done.  Even though I only played this one a few times in the arcade (this game wasn't as widely released as the original Dragon's Lair and Space Ace) I still feel a strong sense of nostalgia when I play this game.  I feel like I'm back in the arcades of the 80s again.  Ah the memories.  Thank you Digital Leisure for redeeming yourselves from the junky DVD version with this blu-ray version of Dragon's Lair II: Timewarp!",1343606400,,3725,4.353111432706223

7914671,1,B00001PE6J,"It's not trivial to get over the bug, it's frustrating and ruins the whole experience!

DO NOT BUY this, I repeat!

I've played the original Dragon's Lair Blu-ray lots of times and I'm very happy with the quality, but DL II: Time Warp Blu-ray is a complete waste of money.
I seriously can't believe how something so badly tested can get out to the market like this!

I wish Digital Leisure would replace my copy with a working one, because this is ridiculous!",1309824000,2,459,4.506024096385542
7914672,1,B00001PE6J,Bought this thinking its a PS3 game for the Blu Ray- its not. A cheesey game to use on any blu ray player using the DVD remote.,1293148800,,127,3.740740740740741
