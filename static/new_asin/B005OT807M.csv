BEST EVER moon movie i have EVER SEEN.

When we colonize the moon we will need to see this film first.",1394323200,,112,4.045454545454546
4854619,1,B005OT807M,"Where are Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing when you really need them? Hammer Films' big-budget foray into the ""space cowboy"" genre never takes off. Strictly drive-in fodder, ""Moon Zero Two"" (1969) opens with a dreadful animated credit sequence and maintains its cheesy weirdness. If you can survive the 100-minute running time, you will find some unintentional laughs.",1383868800,6,369,5.491228070175438
4854620,5,B005OT807M,"I have nothing bad to say about this movie. Other than the fact it is an on demand DVD, meaning it has NO special features (even though the two principals, James Olson and Catherine Schell are still alive to provide an interview and commentary track, and any number of film historians would take about $50 and a shot of scotch to review it).
The plot concerns Olson's Capt. William H. Kemp, an aging astronaut-hero who runs a space salvage operation on the moon where he scratches out every buck for survival. He gets involved with (the stunningly lovely) Schell's Clementine Taplin, who is trying to find a lost miner brother on the far side of the moon. Throw in a no nonsense, do anything for a Lunar Dollar businessman and an asteroid made of sapphire and there is the standard action conflict.
This movie has been described as a Space Western, and I see the tropes and along with what would be called homage today - six shooter, bad guy vs. good guy, aging hero, and show downs. But the same plot devices are used in Robin Hood, Ivanhoe, Ben Hur, Hornblower etc., and were long before Akira Kurosawa provided a shorthand for lazy film critics.  This film is closer to ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" than ""Seven Samurai.""
And it gets the science and technology of the moon down right, and explains it in a way that even Kubrick could have learned from on 2001 - make it simple and don't drag it out.
The science is pretty bang on. That is the problem with a lot of 60s productions about space, they were slightly a notch above the bug eyed monster craze of the 50s in terms of believable science. But audiences were savy by 1969/1970 having been exposed to coverage of the real NASA lunar program and other space exploration efforts.
I would say this movie owes a little to Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's ""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"" and the then in production television show ""UFO,"" in terms of realism and look.
Stylistic look, with props that make sense, and good looking 60s women in future clothes. It all makes one long for the future we were promised but never realized in the late 60s. Now, where is my food in a pill and hover car?",1373155200,21,2153,4.464467005076142
4854621,4,B005OT807M,"Been looking for a long time to get a copy of this much under rated sci-fi movie.  When it was new and I ran it for the first time as a projectionist in a theater, I thought it was going to be a silly cartoon.  Ended up being a good drama with a few ""silly"" parts.  I would tell anyone to buy if looking for this movie.",1361404800,,319,3.7313432835820897
4854622,2,B005OT807M,"I guess this is what we all have to look forward to. All films from the past are going to be DVD-R's, I suppose it is the only way that the very poor Warner Bros. can afford to release these old films. I just wish that they wouldn't charge so much for a dvd-r",1356912000,11,259,3.814814814814815
4854623,4,B005OT807M,"This certainly isn't a ""great"" sci-fi movie but for it's time it was pretty good.  I remembered it from years ago and had been looking for it originally on VHS then on DVD and finally found it and bought it.  It's a fun watch!",1354665600,,226,4.113636363636363
4854624,3,B005OT807M,"Lesser British hammer film with a good story line but low production values, so-so fx and unfortunately acting. One plus...the women are beautiful.",1339286400,5,147,5.434782608695652
4854625,5,B005OT807M,"Absolutely love this version, great picture quality too.  I've waited more than 25 years to see this movie again since I first saw it on TV and I was not disappointed !  I have the MOON ZERO TWO theme song (sung by Julie Driscoll) in my head since the first time I heard it and i absolutely love it!  Great entertainment and fun movie.",1338940800,11,335,4.203125
4854626,5,B005OT807M,"I have been wanting to see this film since I first heard of it back in 1977. My primary reason was due to the fact that one of the leads is actress Catherine Schell, who appeared as the character Maya in the second season of the British Sci-Fi TV series ""Space:1999"". Not that she's a great actress but, material for that series was very hard to come by here in the USA so, this would have been a nice little bonus. As far as this being ""serious"" sci-fi, forget it. It falls squarely in the category occupied by such notorious 60s sci-fi as ""Barbarella"", although it's not quite as outrageous. Special fx are decent, acting is (unintentionally) comic & the music? Well, it sounds like Herb Alpert & his Tijuana Brass did the score. If you're a fan of ""bad"" sci-fi as I am, then this will be a treat. If you're looking for a ""2001""-like experience, keep looking. It ain't here...",1327017600,21,878,4.425925925925926
4854637,4,B005OT807M,"Fun movie for the time. You could do what he producers of the first Airplane comedy did, and that was to buy an existing movie , and make a comedy around it. This movie would be perfect for that. Some nice shots. Hooky as can be, but fun.",1440374400,,238,3.9791666666666665

4854639,4,B005OT807M,"This is another space western complete with saloon brawl and moon canyon gunfight!
Being something of an old scifi aficionado I was surprised that I hadn't heard of this film before. Hammer clearly put a fair amount of money into it and I think the overall art direction and production value is quite good for its time.
I liked Olsen's performance as the wry astronaut - I've seen him elsewhere and that style seems to be his forte. Catherina Von Schell had little to do but looked nice doing it - except for the wig that is.
My only gripes would be the overbearing soundtrack and the introductory cartoon which is silly, has an ugly art style and doesn't fit the film.

a nice film for a rainy saturday afternoon.",1433548800,3,714,4.492307692307692

4854641,5,B005OT807M,"If you are Capt. Kemp, then you are an intrepid explorer - you were the first to Mars, others had explored Venus, and now you long to be the first to Mercury, but the Corporation is done with exploration; now they fly only passenger and cargo flights.  Since then, you have been eking out a living flying an old ship that's ready for the scrap yard.  So when a very rich man wishes to charter your ship for enough money for a new ship - you accept the offer from Mr. Hubbard. . . .

If you are Mr. Hubbard, then you don't care what others think - you smile behind your monocle at the thought that others call you unsavory, with your chain-decorated girls and trigger-happy henchmen.  When Kemp's two flights to the asteroid are completed, you'll be the richest man in the Solar System!  You have made sure that Kemp only learns what he needs to know.  What you don't know is that your scheme is about to unravel when Kemp meets Miss Clementine. . . .

If you are Miss Clementine, then you are concerned about your brother Wally;  he didn't meet you at Moon Port and there is no way to contact him as the communications satellite is down.  You ask Kemp to help you get to your brother's exploratory mine in far-side crater Spectacle - he is willing and you are so grateful.  Later, when he is driving you through the lunar night over the grey, lifeless landscape, you can't quiet quell your sense of foreboding. . . .

Science: good, but not perfect - in one conversation, planets are referred to as stars.

Extra: ""Moon Zero Two"" trailer.

DVD - 2011.  Picture sharpness, contrast, and color: good to excellent.  Sound volume low, clear.  Subtitles: none.",1426118400,7,1655,4.4485049833887045
4854642,3,B005OT807M,"Actually, I like this movie. It's a western in space, about claim jumpers...so you know the plot already. I'd seen it before a few times, back in the early/mid-70s, but I had forgotten this: it's so very 60s it's funny to watch. Keep your expectations low, and it'll be fun.",1420243200,,274,4.5

4854644,4,B005OT807M,"I bought this directly from the WB archive site, but it came new yet scratched... I tested it and it played so I didn't ask for another copy. This movies is very enjoyable, cheesy... dated, but I like the 60's style of visuals and corny music. The story is hokey, Catherine Schell is gorgeous and the plot is amusing enough; once famous space explorer William Kemp now a hired hand on a mission to crash a valuable asteroid laden with sapphire into the moon at the behest of a criminal moon tycoon.",1416268800,,498,4.423913043478261

4854646,5,B005OT807M,"I'll be honest, I didn't know quite what to expect from this movie.  I'd only seen brief clips on YouTube.  But Moon Zero Two was exceptionally good.  The acting and writing were both top notch, with an excellent plot and well developed characters who got some very good lines.  The special effects are dated, obviously, but very good for the time with excellent models.  What I was most surprised by was the solid core of science behind the movie.  Someone had clearly done their research for the film.  It even predicted the discovery of ice on the moon many decades before we learned of it.  Also, the only undeveloped technology from the movie was artificial gravity, a standard of space operas for generations.  The rest (moon colony, mining on the moon, trips to other worlds in our system) are things our civilization could do if we had the political will and economic necessity.  You won't get much in the way of extras, and the beginning animation is a bit weird, but otherwise you're looking at good entertainment at a reasonable price.",1408579200,6,1046,4.7292817679558015

8481901,5,B005OT807M,Moon Zero Two is a almost forgotten SciFi film and I remember seeing it in the theater in Fairbanks Alaska when it came out.
