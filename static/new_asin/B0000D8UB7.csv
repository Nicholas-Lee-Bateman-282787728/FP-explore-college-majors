I'm not one to throw money around, so ordering the rest of the series says very good things about the first two volumes. I've also watched many, many mixed martial art bouts, and Adam's teachings seem right in line with the pros' techniques. Also, I just noticed for the first time that Adam has won Jui Jitsu tournaments, not to mention mixed martial art tournaments, so you can bet you're getting the same instruction that the pros are getting.

I'm very curious about the two posts that gave only two stars. One of them sounds like an advertisement for a book, and the other seems completely misguided... for example, regarding the ridiculous comment about roundhouse kicks. The fact is, UFC and other mixed martial artists get knocked out by roundhouse kicks to the head all the time, and if you're in a situation on the streets where a roundhouse kick to the head is not practical, then you use another type kick, punch, takedown, etc, taught by Adam... very strange post, indeed.

Now back to volumes 1 and 2. Volume 1 is Muay Thai boxing techniques, along with some other moves... very thorough. If I recall correctly, each move in volume 2 is demonstrated about five times throwing around a ""live"" partner. The 3rd and 4th times are in fast motion such as if you were in a real fight, and the fifth time is in slow motion. The first couple of times he is carefully walking you through the move while explaining the details. Trust me, you won't be left wondering how to do the move in either video. Another thing I liked was how many grappling moves were demonstrated in volume 2. There definitely is a lot to absorb. Adam speaks very clearly, and the quality of video is excellent. I got the feeling that he really wanted you to ""get"" it (the moves).

I think you can safely spend your money with the first two videos. Again, the other three are on order, but I'm confident that I'll be very pleased with them, otherwise, I wouldn't be ordering them, or bothering with this review (actually the two star posts angered me because I thought they were very unfair, so I felt especially compelled to write this review).",1232150400,2,2210,4.547738693467337
8000063,5,B0000D8UB7,"Within the first 10 seconds of this DVD you can tell it is worth the money, but my absolute favorite thing about the production is that the host wears a microphone so you can actually understand what he's saying; honestly it makes a world of difference.  Also, he warns you about what moves you can expect to find on the street or at a bar in the real world and how to counter them.",1187654400,,382,4.162162162162162
8000064,2,B0000D8UB7,"Have a look at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0834804441/002-0312612-5340014?v=glance&n=283155 or just Google the word ""Hapkido technique book"" OR isbn 0834804441

This is just a fantastic book that has step by step illustrations on everything. Starts with philosophy (short & sweet) then starts with the basic stances, punches and blocks (white belt stuff) then moves all the way through to weapons training and defence. There's a whole section devoted to the use of 'conventional weapons' like brooms, forks, books, etc. very useful in teaching our relatives the ""Basics"" on how to defend themselves without having to spend several years in martial arts training. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone.",1137888000,,704,5.769230769230769
8000065,2,B0000D8UB7,"I'm sure Hutch is a real bad dude but his home video of ""basic"" movies is worth maybe 10 dollars at best.  His commentary and script seemed thrown together in no real order.  Plus, it would be helpfull to know correct ways to punch and stand rather than how to round house someone to the head.  Come on now, no REAL person is going to try a kick to someones face.  As soon as you do, yo can expect to get bull-dogged to the floor and have your face pounded in.  Most people will come at you flailing; swinging wild punches and going for holds and take downs.  No offense to Hutch but maybe the basic principles he teaches will help a bit, but it's not really anything phenominal.  Save your money folks. I think I am going to try a book to help me improve my fighting next time. Anyone know of some good ones?",1124150400,2,809,4.147435897435898
8000066,5,B0000D8UB7,"Having bought all 5 DVDs in Adam ""Pitt Bull"" Series this is another top notch lesson to complete your fight game. He breaks down each move so you can master it quickly without hesitation. I really like the reversals and escapes from dangerous groundfighting positions, this is what will really gives you the advantage should a street fight go to the ground. Most people don't have a clue how to grapple or fight on the ground. As Adam says 95% of all street fights end up on the ground! Everyone will benefit from this ground fighting DVD.",1077062400,5,539,4.56701030927835
