4719179,5,B005KSOJOA,"With the re-release of the Sailor Moon comics, I've been keeping an eye open for the TV series. That has been rather difficult, seeing as no one owns the rights in the U.S. One season alone goes for $200 dollars, most times even more than that. So when I saw this, I thought it was too good to be true. All five seasons, plus the three movies, for $250? AND you get the uncut Japanese version too? There had to be a catch.
No catch. This item is exactly what it's listed as. You get all four seasons of the English version and their Japanese counterparts (seasons 1 and 2 have two separate boxes, one for English, one for Japanese then the other seasons only come in one case, with the ability to switch between English and Japanese). What's super exciting is that you also get Season 5, which I had no idea existed until a bit ago. This season was never done in English, but it does come with subtitles. This is what I'm looking forward to the most, as I've never seen it. You also get all three movies.

A note: Season 1, 2, and 4 come in those twice-as-big DVD cases, while seasons 3 and 5 do not. Season 5 I can understand, since it's only in Japanese, but I thought it odd that season 3 comes in a regular DVD box, then it switches back to the big box for season 4.

Finally, something must be said about this seller's customer service. I ordered my set back at the end of January, and as soon as I got my tracking number, every day I would check it to see where it was. Something went wrong, however, and it never arrived at a UPS location. Concerned--it is a lot of money--I contacted the seller, expecting to hear back in a few days. I was contacted that very same day with an apology. They said they would call UPS to find out what happened, and if they had to, would ship a new one. Two days later (it had been over the weekend, so stuff was closed), I got an e-mail saying, ""New order on it's way. Here's the tracking number. Delivery tomorrow!"" And sure enough, I got it the next day. This seller spares no expense in making sure that their customers are satisfied.

If you are a fan of Sailor Moon, but, like me, never got a chance to own it because the rights were lost in the U.S. before you had a chance to buy it, then this is the way to go. The title ""Sailor Moon: The Ultimate Uncut Collection"" is well deserved. Pick it up.",1328745600,22,2343,4.179203539823009
4719180,5,B005KSOJOA,"If you are a true Sailor Moon fan, then I would definitely recommend the Sailor Moon Ultimate Uncut Collection, which includes 8 box sets containing the English dubbed episodes, original Japanese episodes, and all three movies. So far I've only gotten through seasons 1 & 2, but I feel my purchase was worth every penny. I've been looking for the entire series for a long, long time, and when I saw I could not only get the English dubbed version, but the original Japanese version, AND all three Sailor Moon movies in one set for only $250, I thought it was too good to be true. My expectations were definitely met far and beyond. The visual and audio quality is AWESOME. Just as I remembered it when I watched it as a little girl. The English dubbed version is exactly what it was when it aired back in the 90's. This is the first time that I've ever seen any of the original Japanese episodes, but I'm definitely glad I have them. It's very, very interesting to watch an English episode, and then pop in the Japanese version right after. The English version of Sailor Moon, I believe, is poorly scripted/cheesy a lot of the time (I still love it!), and I've noticed, and have read, that the Japanese version is much more adult and dark. I definitely agree with this and actually prefer the Japanese script compared to the English. Also, they have noticeably edited or completely removed certain episodes out of the English airings that weren't seen on U.S. cable. You can view the unedited and missing episodes when watching the Japanese version. These were obviously cut/edited because of either too much violence or sexual undertones. I don't think these episodes would be too inappropriate if they were aired on cable today, but I suppose back in the 90's television wasn't what it is today. One thing I do have to say that I'm not a big fan of with regards to the Japanese version is the music. Reminds me of bad 80's elevator music. I very much prefer the English soundtrack. The Japanese voices are also hard to get use to after growing up with the English voices (even if Sailor Moon's voice is just awful in Season 3 and 4, yuck!), but honestly the script is so good in the Japanese version you hardly even notice it and get wrapped up in the storyline.  I haven't watched all of season 5 (which is strictly Japanese language with English subtitles), but as said in other reviews I've read, the visual quality is not as excellent as with the other seasons, but it is still very good. I've been lead to believe that this season may or may not be a bootleg because it was never aired in the U.S., but if it is a bootleg, it's a very good one. I'm glad I have this considering I've never been able to watch these episodes. All in all I am crazy happy with this set. So far I haven't had too many problems while watching them, except maybe a skip or two on what I've watched so far of Season 5. They have played great on my old TV, but as I've said, I've only watched the first two Seasons of the English dubbed, and a few episodes of the Japanese version.  If you are a true Sailor Moon fan I definitely recommend this set or any set from the KGY-LLC/Animage seller. Also, if there is a problem with discs that are damaged or missing, supposedly this seller offers a warranty, which I received in my package.

Happy Sailor Mooning!",1328400000,28,3339,4.4526143790849675
4719181,5,B005KSOJOA,SO I bought the ultimate boxset as part of my collection and I am very pleased and happy with it. the seller is very prompt in answering my questions - i know I am a pain in the head. hehehe The DVDs are great...... I am so happy with it. :),1326758400,10,241,3.7450980392156863
4719182,5,B005KSOJOA,"Nice quality, but I was disappointed that the episodes that were cut in season 2 for the english version are NOT in the Season 2 Japanese version, also on the description of The Sailor Moon Movies it says ""Nerptune"" instead of Neptune. I didn't mind it saying Nerptune but I was very disappointed that the episodes that were cut were not in the Japanese version. Other than that great quality, deliver, and seller.

4719183,3,B005KSOJOA,"It looks pretty legit with the nice box set and cases along with the artwork on the DVDs. My only complaints are that the DVDs have a strong annoying smell since it's not original and are just copies and that the credits have a blur on top of season 3. Also, it's overpriced for something not original. But hey, it's hard to find this kinda set and they do give you lifetime warranty for your DVDs.",1406505600,,398,4.25

I had seen all the aired in English episodes but never the last season, Sailor stars. I am halfway through the Sailor Stars episodes now and I LOVE it. I recommend this set to anyone who loves sailor moon as much as I do. Well worth the cost, and it even arrived earlier than expected.

That's right my fellow Sailor Moon fans, we will finally get to see all five seasons, uncut and dubbed (or rewatch subbed). No more gender swaps! Original names! Relationships won't be changed! (Namely, two ""cousins"" will not be... uh, cousins, anymore) ;) It's being released in the fall, I highly recommend waiting!

As for this product here, I still love it. I grew up with the dub and still love it, despite the flaws. There ARE many good things about it, though the original sub still is the best. :)",1401062400,7,645,4.649122807017544

4719191,5,B005KSOJOA,"I was a little skeptical when I scanned the discs and they are region free with no CSS encoding.  That almost always means it is a pirated version.  In this case, if this is a pirated version, I say let them pirate everything!  The transfers to DVD are beautifully done and the audio is spot on as well (limited to 2.0 due to the age of the show, not their fault).  The cases are top quality and the disc labels are beautiful as well.  They even come with inserts listing each episode by number.

My only complaint is that the episodes on the disc (in the disc menu) are NOT labeled.  They appear in a circle around the outside of the menu, with a picture in the center.  They actually go from top to bottom on the left, then start at the top again and go from top to bottom on the right.  Once you know, it is easy to go in order.

These also have a lifetime warranty, so a free replacement will be sent if you have an unfortunate incident.

I could not be more pleased.",1396224000,4,971,4.111702127659575
4719192,4,B005KSOJOA,Have been a sailor moon fan for years and was really excited when I found the complete series with the movies. I got my copy last night and I wasn't disappointed. though I wish that the quality of the movie was updated I know that that is not the seller but the company that makes the video is responsible (quality is of original series quality) the nice touch to this is that there is a lifetime warranty for the disks so if one accidentally gets scratched or broken I can get them replaced. the only other negitive thing I can say about these is the waiting time to get them seemed a bit long but well worth the wait.,1395187200,3,619,4.2100840336134455
4719193,4,B005KSOJOA,I have enjoyed re-watching the DVD's with my daughter so much! I was overjoyed when it came earlier than expected. The only downside is that after some very light use I've noticed that the DVD cases are rather flimsy and the part that holds the DVD's in will break off very easily. I bought my own cases for them and simply replaced the paper cover. This is why I give it only 4 stars. The quality of the shows are great though! Especially for it to be an anime that's several years old!,1393891200,2,487,4.247311827956989
4719194,4,B005KSOJOA,"I have wanted these DVDs for quite some time now. I have held off for expense purposes, mostly...and the contemplations of whether or not I was ready to cross over into THAT threshold of nerdiness: becoming THAT girl who has an entire anime series on DVD. But with the reasonable pricing of this DVD collection set in Diamond remaster format, I had to just say ""forget it: all aboard the nerd express!""

4719196,5,B005KSOJOA,"My girlfriend grew up on this show. I was determined to find her a set that included, at the very least, all the seasons in English that aired in America. I look everywhere and quickly realized half of the collections available were bad quality imports from China or Malaysia. Some Europeans imports were good but wouldn't play on our DVD player so what could we do?

I kept searching!

I ended up ordering three different collections and only kept the one I thought was best value for money.  I chose this one and here's why:
-The new 2013 edition now includes a beautiful full color glossy inlay card that lists all the episodes per disc. Very useful.
-The DVD boxsets are beautiful and glossy as well (without any smell, which is common with cheap imports)
-The discs holders are of high quality. Not a single disc, out of the fifty, arrived scratched or undone. Three years ago I bought a Battlestar Galactica collection and the discs came in paper sleeves... my discs arrived loose all over the box, and I had paid 200$ for it, and it was manufactured in America! So you gotta do your homework people.
-The boxsets are collectible and there's a coherent design that makes them look like an actual collection if placed on a bookshelf.

But ultimately what really matters is the quality of the sound and the image and I was thoroughly impressed. Keeping in mind that this is a show from the early 90s and that it's been twenty years since it first aired, the show stills holds up in the look department. The animations are relatively crisp even at 1080p resolution (upconverted). The sound is without artifacts and is clear as well.

People might rise their eyebrow at the price but this collection includes EIGHT boxsets. That's five seasons, UNCUT, three movies, in both English and Japanese audio, with perfect grammar in the subtitles. Fifty discs overall. It's a lot of material.

Thanks for this, my girl is the happiest gal on the Earth! And the Moon! :)",1385424000,67,1964,4.661849710982659
4719197,5,B005KSOJOA,"I really enjoyed viewing the whole series.  I'm grateful to the previous viewers who advised the Ultimate Collection as the best way to go - it is WELL worth the price.  After viewing the English-dubbed version, I viewed the Japanese with the subtitles - WOW how the story subtly changed!!!  I don't think I will ever go back to the English version again.
Only drawback is the that the subtitles go missing frequently in Season 5, but only occasionally in the other seasons.  I am hoping this is an error and is corrected on other disks.  I'll be giving that a try.  I did note a disk problem with Season 1 and requested a replacement.  The wrong disk was sent...still they did live up to the warranty, so I'll try again.

Truly loved this series!!!",1381536000,5,749,4.496296296296296
4719198,5,B005KSOJOA,"I've been a Sailor Moon fan for about 10 years now.  I started watching it during the mornings while getting ready for school, and I fell in love with it, even with all the cheesey ""sailor says"" endings.

I only gave it 4 stars because the only problem I had with the product was sailor moon season 5 (sailor stars). Either subtitles didn't show, or they'd show up faster than they should've, and it looked like a scene may have gotten cut off on one episode.

4719200,5,B005KSOJOA,"So--this is an amazing view. It MIGHT NOT be legal--COULD BE pirated...but the quality of the viewing is still 5 stars...If the money doesnt go to the original people OH WELL. If they never authorized it to come to the states OH WELL. We still get it--and considering the 5 season is ONLY in Japanese and not in english--makes me think that it might not be bogus/fake. It plays great.  You get all the seasons plus the 1st two season in japanese uncut AND all three movies. And the truth is--all that, it WOULD cost around 250. Its a show thats been out of print for a LONG time and are considered collectors items.  You MIGHT be able to find them cheaper--but WHERE? get it. Its worth it",1345680000,8,688,4.3671875

This compilation is bootlegged, and completely illegal.  As of March 16, 2012, you cannot buy new versions of the Sailor Moon anime legally anywhere in the United States.  Toei animation still holds the license for it, and it is NOT selling copies in the United States.

Many reviewers have stated that Season 5 may or may not be a bootleg.  I can promise you, IT IS A BOOTLEG.  The fifth season of Sailor Moon anime has never, ever, EVER been released legally in the United States.

I have searched every single distributor of legal anime in the US, and none of them hold a license to distribute this show on DVD.  Buying these bootleg copies does not give any money back to the industry we love, nor do any of the creators get credit for the purchase.  With the popularity of the re-release of the manga series, we are bound to get a re-release eventually, and it certainly won't cost us $250!

Season 1 seems to have been taken from the ADV discs as there is the ADV ""10th anniversary"" logo at the start. Season 5 is a step down in quality I don't know where this came from. why this seller decides to use 50 DVDs for this set is inexplicable as they would surely fit on less discs without any quality loss. They are already low resolution, have washed out colour and and lack detail.  The subtitles seem good.
