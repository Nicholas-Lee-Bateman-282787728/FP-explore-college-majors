5462362,5,B00AO05AGA,"What happens when you accidentally sign yourself up for a death match against six other players with only one ally to rely upon? You get the premise for this show. Fate Stay Night (FSN) is a modern classic for anime fans. The series started out as a visual novel game by Type Moon, but became popular enough to spawn this anime series, as well as a prequel series called Fate Zero.

As mentioned above, the main character, Shiro Emiya, discovers that he is in the middle of the Holy Grail War, a war of mages and their summoned spirits to win a prize that even King Arthur would be envious of. The mages are called masters and the spirits that they summon are called servants. The servants are actually the spirits of mythological or historical people. There are many rules to the Holy Grail War that are explained throughout the show, kind of like Future Diary or Eden of the East; however some of the rules do seem conveniently made up to convenience the plot or that particular episode.

Arguably the most popular character in this franchise is the character called Saber. She is the blond haired girl on the cover wearing blue and white. She is the main character's servant, and as her name implies, she is very skilled with a sword. Saber ends up living with Shiro at his very large residence, which he inherited from his late foster father. He also has a few other house guests including one of his rivals in the game, Rin Tohsaka. She is the master of a servant called Archer, a powerful man who is not only skilled with a bow, but knives and swords.

All of the servants in the game are named after a character class like in a video game. Examples are caster, berserker, lancer, and others. The fight scenes against the different servants are very impressive. In fact, all the characters look very good too, and the backgrounds, especially the school setting at sunset looks very nice. For a show from 2006, it looks like it could of been made recently, much like the anime, Shakugan no Shana. Although it is true that the movie feature, FSN Unlimited Blade Works and the prequel, Fate Zero, look even better than this series, but this is still a good show.

Magic, fighting, some comedy, a sense of justice, complicated family histories, good looking characters, and plot twists are what entail this series. This new DVD collection from Sentai Filmworks retains the previous English dub cast, but lacks any real special features besides the songs and trailers, which are on any and every anime DVD. All 24 episodes are included on 4 discs in this collection. It does not take up any more shelf space than a normal DVD case would, which is always nice.",1381017600,5,2660,4.593684210526316
5462363,5,B00AO05AGA,loved the whole series all good things must comes to a end im still watching fate and zero series one of the best better yet best animes ever made,1378684800,,146,4.068965517241379
5462364,5,B00AO05AGA,i was glued to screen the hole time i watched this one.it starts out good and has good ending.if looking for good action anime.then this is the one.,1370822400,,148,4.321428571428571
5462365,1,B00AO05AGA,"I love the series, and when I found that this was coming out to DVD within a good price range, I bought this right away.

But I can't WATCH this thing on anything but our ten year old DVD player. My desktop won't play it. My blu-ray/DVD player won't play it. The only thing I haven't tried it on yet is the PS3, but I have doubts about that.

The DVD box and all the disks claim it's a Region 1, so it SHOULD work. But it doesn't. What good are DVDs I can't watch?",1364947200,3,464,3.873684210526316
5462366,5,B00AO05AGA,"I bought this at a local store.  I wanted to save for the Blue Ray version, but it was an impulse buy and cheaper.  50 for half a 24 season is a little too much without any extra feature like a making of or any commentary.

So this box had the 24 episodes of the series and a clean opening and closing song sections and previews for other shows.

The quality is at least as good as the old DVDs and the sound is also good.
This series is a little slow to start because it was based of a Visual Novel game called Fate/Stay Night. Visual Novels are like those old ""choose your own  adventure"" novels where the choices you make create different events and ultimately very different endings.  The difference is Japanese Visual Novels have music, voice acting, images, text and the occasional video and other little extra added to make it more interesting.  Another example of an Anime made from a visual novel would be Stiens, Gate another show that starts slow but ends up in spectacular story telling and action near the end of the series.  For both shows I can say the slow first half's are well worth the awesome and interesting endings that are the latter half of the shows.  I mean most shows start hot and then get crappy, but these start OK and then end up with a incredible ending.

Fate/stay night was a fan favorite and cult classic for the Visual Novels and has made lots of money.  While the original game hasn't been officially released in the US fans have found ways to play it and it was awesome.  There are 3 main paths and 15 dead end paths at least.  Each major path reveals a different amount of information and unlocks a another path if you play it though.  Real replay value.

This anime fallows the first common path Fate.  Here Shirou learns about the tragedy that destroyed his former life and scared his city and the responsibility and the cost of being a here and balancing the lives of the innocent against those that can be saved.  He must participate in a war with seven magi with skills and powers in a war that has an ultimate wish granting device called the Holy Grail.  This war is fought using re-embodied souls of ancient heroes brought back to life temporarily by the Holy Grail and these heroes fight and kill for that prize to have their wishes granted.  The seven heroes are the seven servants of the seven magi.  Only one pair can remain at the end to claim the prize.

But the other servants must be sacrificed in order for the Grail to appear. There are however several things very different about this grail war that has occurred in this Fuyuki city 4 times before.  The last grain war cost Shirou his family and his memories, the next may claim the world.  He must fight to save the innocent and find out what it what it means to save some one and what it means to be a hero.

There is also another DVD following the second path called ""Unlimited Blade Works"" following shirou and other characters revealing more about Shirou and his future path beyond the grail war.  Its only a movie instead of a whole series so it is confusing if you haven't watch the anime TV series first.  So buy the TV anime and then the movie and you'll enjoy both more.  In fact after getting Unlimited Blade Works go back and re watch the anime and you'll see hints of what was revealed in the movie that you didn't notice or guess at when you watched the anime by itself, I know I sure did.",1364169600,12,3410,4.362916006339145
5462367,5,B00AO05AGA,"Confused Shopper...

So, if buying the blu-ray releases.. which ones do you buy in order to have the Complete series?

There is too many versions available and lack good info to tell them apart.  I don't want to buy a lot of them versions that end up being a lot of duplication's, would rather buy ""the complete series"".

If I were to buy:
  (1) Fate/Stay Night: Collection 1 [Blu-ray]
-- & --
  (2) Fate/Stay Night: Collection 2 [Blu-ray]

Is that the exact same thing as just buying this:
 => Fate / Stay Night TV: Complete Collection [Blu-ray] --- Right?

If so, then to get them all, I would just need to get that ""Complete Collection"" and then just
add: => Fate / Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works [Blu-ray] -- Right?",1488067200,,722,4.476923076923077

5462369,5,B00AO05AGA,"While this adaptation isn't completely faithful to the original visual novel, as a standalone anime it has a certain magic about it that the widely acclaimed ufotable productions can't quite match. Of particular note are the Kenji Kawai soundtrack and excellent Japanese voice actors. In short, this anime is immensely enjoyable and I highly recommend it, especially to fans of Saber. Those new to the Fate series may wish to watch this after playing the VN and/or watching Unlimited Blade Works (ufotable 2015).",1486857600,4,512,5.180722891566265

5462373,5,B00AO05AGA,"Many Fate fans will tell you how terrible this show, is but they're dead wrong. The character interaction in this show is amazing and, in my opinion, better than the other Fate anime. It really brings out the positive and negative traits of the characters, and makes them feel more human. There is also plenty of character development. Saber in particular is a much stronger and more admirable female lead in this, instead of the doormat she came off as in Fate/Zero. Musically, the soundtrack is amazing, and the songs really give off that honorable Knightly feel to complement Saber's dignity and knighthood. I also like the character designs and their expressions instead of that 'glassy' eyed look they have in Fate Zero anime.

The show does start off with a lot of information presented to you, but that's done to break down the plot inform the viewer of the general rules of the Holy Grail war.

Do yourself a favor and pick up this anime!",1475193600,,946,4.692771084337349

What I will say is that as the pioneer to the entire Fate franchise, this was a good start. I always like to get the ""bad"" ending before I go on to the ""true"" or ""good"" ending, which is what it feels like moving on from this iteration to the UBW and Zero series.

Anyway, the DVDs are all in a single case, with each DVD in its own holder. The DVD quality is good and the animation is, though dated, still acceptable. At least it's not Akira-level anime lol.",1472342400,,578,4.115044247787611

5462385,1,B00AO05AGA,"By far one of the worst Anime I have ever watched. It has plenty of interesting ideas and concepts, but no real character development or interests. A major waste of time. Fate/Zero is by and large a much improved version of Fate/stay night. Completely with fleshed out characters, a plot and development to go along with each character. FSN just has none of these things. The characters are reduced to being nothing more than your standard Harem/High School garbage. Watch Fate/Zero and have a new understanding of what real art is and how to tell a story with riveting characters. Watch FSN to be bored out of your mind.",1454889600,,621,4.706422018348624
5462386,2,B00AO05AGA,"This is not what I thought I was getting. My intent was to have the show that streamed on Netflix for my collection. However, not being aware that there are actually TWO incarnations of the series, I purchased this with high hopes. This is the original 2006 Series re-mastered for Blue-Ray. But it is a completely different telling of the same story. It lacks the same impact as the 2014 incarnation being shown on Netflix (Fate: Stay Night- Ultimate Blade Works: The Series, not to be confused with the 105 min Ultimate Blade Works OVA). Character development in this version is rushed and un- interesting. The animation, while re-mastered, is adequate at best. If you are looking for the Netflix version, this is not it, and really not worth it. This version does more damage to the Fate: Stay Night story line than help it. Honestly, had I seen this version I never would have become a fan of the series in the first place. As a fan of anime, I found myself ultimately disappointed with this and feel slightly regretful that I did not do more research about the show prior to my purchase. I guess I will just have to wait for Ultimate Blade Works: The Series to come out...Then I'll be happy.....",1453680000,7,1199,4.5813953488372094
5462387,5,B00AO05AGA,"Reviews etc online say not to bother with this Fate series, and just to watch the Ufotable ones. Do not listen to them, this is a gem!

A lot of people will tell you that Fate/Zero, and Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Bladeworks, made by Ufotable, are far better, and as far as production quality is concerned, sure they are, they're beautiful. I actually watched the two of them first, before I knew this anime by studio DEEN existed. But  I watched all of this one in two sittings, and positively love it. Maybe it's because I am team Saber vs. team Rin, but that is just my taste. This one definitely seems to have a little bit more of a visual novel feel to me, with maybe more use of still images. The overall feel of the anime was less heavy I felt than the two newer ones were, but the ending had a much more impactful feels-heavy effect on me. Musically, I think that this one has a little bit more and more frequently used ""light-hearted"" type music but that may be my memory.

Anyways, I absolutely love this anime and bought it immediately after I finished watching it. Came quickly enough in the mail, though unfortunately the blu-ray case was a little cracked in the corner, but I don't even care enough about that to detract in my review. Five stars all the way. Should buy if you have any doubt, haha if you like anime and have any interest in this, go for it, I strongly approve of the decision.",1452988800,12,1405,4.354961832061068
5462388,3,B00AO05AGA,"I bought this thinking it was one thing and it was something completely different. So let me clarify here- this is the first collection in this series (it is NOT the one that's streamed through Netflix). Because it's the first the animation is good but not as good as the newer series releases. This series is modeled after a video game that I have never played and because I haven't- I find it a bit confusing. It's broken down into three series- this one, Fate Stay Nighte ZERO and finally Fate Stay Night UNLIMITED BLADE WORKS. The story arcs are based on different decisions or stories that are video game playable.

So after my initial disappointment that this was not what I thought it was, I have to admit it has it's own good-albeit different-story. I think because it's the original it's worth giving a shot and if you can watch it before the newer stuff you may not mind that the battling scenes are not as flashy or extravagant. I'll warn you once again the story is complicated, even after watching everything I still have unanswered questions, but that's what also makes it intriguing.

Basically this series is about magi that enter into a holy grail war. For the war each magi is assigned a fighter (archer, rider, saber etc) This story focuses on Shiro whereas the unlimited story focuses more on Rin but both characters are very connected to one another's story. The voice actor in this particular DVD set is superior to the one in unlimited, I just can't get over that the unlimited set uses the same voice actor that plays Kirito in SAO, for me it just doesn't work as well. The series itself really struggles with the question of how to save others without killing those that threaten that safety. I know I am not explaining the plot great but I think it's one you need to watch for yourself. I found this set worth watching and it took awhile but definitely grew on me after the initial shock/disappointment of it not being the unlimited set I initially thought it was. Also just to clarify there is a movie out as well for this series, I have not watched it yet so just be careful when making a purchase that you are getting what you want. It would have been helpful if they had not kept the titles so similar because it really gets confusing when purchasing.",1448841600,3,2281,4.520581113801453

5462407,3,B00AO05AGA,"First things first; watch this before Fate/Zero. Trust me. Quite honestly, Fate/Stay Night is a disappointment, to say the least. It could have been executed a lot better (and it is, apparently, in Unlimited Blade Works), but, for a franchise experiment, it works out passably. The animation is lackluster, but sometimes the fight scenes can become a spectacle; the producers put the budget where it matters. The music is less than terrific, but the 2nd opening at least starts off the second half of the series on a decently high note. The plot is simple, yet entertaining. I would not expect anything deeper than the revelation that ""People die when they are killed,"" because that's about as intellectual as things get. The characters are forgettable, save Saber because...well, because of who she is historically. Thus lies the best factor of this series: the premise. There is just something about historical figures of different ""classes"" pairing up with mages and duking it out for the wish-granting grail that is attention-worthy from the get-go. You have no idea who will defeat whom, and the reasoning behind this whole ""Grail War"" and its absurd rules is intriguing in of itself.  Sadly, though, the anime screeches to a grinding halt and ends in a far messier and anti-climactic way than one might expect, ruining any hopes of redeeming itself with impressive final thoughts. Once again, Anime producers pull the ""Evil Catholic Church"" card, which I have grown tired of, but I forgive it because the situation is expounded upon rather well in Fate/Zero. If you haven't noticed, Fate/Zero blows this series away. So, is Fate/Stay Night worth watching? Yes, because it is a good introduction into the world Fate/Zero perfects. Is it worth buying? Probably only to the avid Fate fan. I recommend one watches Fate/Stay Night as a low-budget prologue for the high-budget Fate/Zero so that one can become accustomed to the world and characters; take my word as you see fit.",1421280000,,1978,5.0121580547112465

The series is a nice mix of fantasy violence, romance, and humor, with very little fanservice and profanity. Overall, a good series if not a little slow paced at times.

5462414,2,B00AO05AGA,"I watched Fate/Zero before watching this, and I wish it had been the other way around. In fact, it might be better to avoid this and only watch Fate/Zero (which is AWESOME). The main character in this series is beyond annoying almost all the time for so many reasons. There are a lot of great animes that incorporate humor well into action driven dramas, but the humor in this just seems goofy and misplaced. The action scenes are lackluster for the most part, and the character development is weak.",1389571200,,499,4.617977528089888
5462415,4,B00AO05AGA,"I gave a four star rating simply because this anime is very different from the fate zero series. Which was beautifully written with very in depth characters that you could really get into. Didnt matter if they died you got to enjoy them for who they were.
 Ith this series however I feel that they changed the focus from developing the characters depth and feel to just developing one character. The master Shiro Emiya. So I feel that the show in general lacked the  feeling of getting to know who the players were. And instead focused only on the game itself.
 The show also took about 5 episodes to really draw me in. But I think it was due to the previous issue. Has I not watched the prequel first I probably wouldn't feel that way.
 Ok so the cons are out of the way. The artwork was beautiful (barring the less than amazing dragon cgi section). The game itself was played out well. And once you get into it the story is fairly captivating. I really did enjoy it overall.
 This is definitely a main character show. Yes he has a team but all in all it focuses on one guy. But for many anime watchers that's a good thing. Especially for those that like to know who they are rooting for. Hopefully this review was helpful. And I do hope that if you decide to purchase this series, you enjoy it as much as I ultimately did.",1388188800,,1324,4.301204819277109

Soundtracks not as impressive as the other Fate Zero or UBW tv adaptations. But with Saber as the heroine, you can't go wrong :)",1530748800,,270,4.313725490196078

8555037,5,B00AO05AGA,"One of my favorite anime of all time. For those who are new to the Fate/Stay Night series, Fate/Zero is the prequel to this story. Then it goes Fate/Stay Night, which is the official and canon route. Then you got Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel, which are the neutral and bad routes to the Visual Novel, made into an anime. Hope this helps.

8555042,4,B00AO05AGA,"The complete first Fate series in one solid (affordable) collection. Unlike too many other offers on Amazon, this DVD of the original Fate/Stay Night was reasonably prices and arrived in perfect condition. First things first, do not confuse this collection with either Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night:  Unlimited Blade Works. Zero was a prequel series that is amazing and does a great job tying up the loose ends of this series and fleshes out the backstory of many characters who appear here. Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works is a second take on THIS series. After the anime rights passed to a second company they published and released Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works to retell and replace this show with a higher budget and an expanded number of episodes.

The Fate series is based around a recurring war between magicians over the legendary Holy Grail. Every few years the Grail appears to grant a magus a powerful wish. Seven mages are selected to duel each other (to the death if they so choose) for the right to claim the Grail and its wish. For the sake of the duel, each magus summons a Servant:  powerful figures of myth or history who fight on their masters' behalves. The Servants each fall into a specific class depending on the weapons or fighting styles they use. Fate/Stay Night specifically follows main character Emiya who was raised by a powerful mage and unwittingly gets dragged into the new Holy Grail war. A mage of growing power, Emiya accidentally summons Saber, one of the most powerful Servants, to fight for him and manages to ally himself with Rin: one of his classmates at school who is herself an adept mage involved in the Holy Grail War.

The original series is still an old favorite of mine, though you can see (in comparison to Fate/Zero or the Unlimited Blade Works reboot) the original publisher's limited budget in effect during certain action scenes where fights are not fully animated out but feature quick jump cuts to static images of characters swinging weapons or blocking attacks. The series also has a much stronger romantic vibe due to the first Fate visual novel games being part-adult oriented dating sims. Thus the onus in this show is highly focused on main character Emiya's feelings for Saber and his nearly harem anime-esque interactions with other characters like Rin or Sakura. Despite the fact that Fate/Zero and the reboot are stronger series, in my opinion, this original show is still worth watching as it is a great mash up of rom-com and fantasy. Fans will definitely want to pick up this series, though you should absolutely watch the more action/horror oriented Fate/Zero prequel or the expanded budget reboot (the latter also gave a more prominent role to the mysterious and antagonistic Archer who gets written out of the original series a bit too quickly). Sadly, both of the newer shows are also extremely hard to find on DVD or Blu-Ray for an affordable price. You're best bet is to check them out on Netflix or Crunchyroll.",1493424000,11,3000,4.853515625
