7872307,4,6304474393,"This video is a great introduction to the ecology of the rainforest. The soundtrack is good (although nap-inspiring in some places). The camera work is top notch (it is National Geographic after all). The narration is engaging, but a little over-dramatic in places. The only gripe I have is the ""save the rainforest"" bit at the end of the tape. It is as annoying as it is unnecessary. Most people I know could live without more eco-preaching.",1194134400,2,442,4.753246753246753
