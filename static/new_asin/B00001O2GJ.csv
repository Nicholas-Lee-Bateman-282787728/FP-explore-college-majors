7914567,5,B00001O2GJ,"I absolutely love my set, contrary to other reviews i've read on here, the quality is great, sound quality is great, and overall i am extremely satisfied with the price as these are hard to find on DVD.  This is a must-have for any Marx Brothers Fan!",1140220800,,250,4.319148936170213
7914568,5,B00001O2GJ,"I was lucky enough to get these DVDs during the monkey business stating that these films were being re-released.  And the price went down from $700 to $200-$300.  Still pretty expensive, but well worth it for any true Marx Brother's fan.  They're only being released in the non-USA (PAL) version.  And I think many (including myself) were confused by the new 5 DVD set that's coming out in Nov.  I was hoping that this set would include 5 of their movies, but it's just a documentary type film (one that I'm eager to see).  To sum this all up, I give this DVD set 10 stars....5 more than the amazon rating system allows.",1067990400,2,620,4.442477876106195
7914569,1,B00001O2GJ,"As usual, you have some people trying to rip you off here, charging $305 for 3 DVDs.  And they probably call themselves fans of American comedy.  Ha!
There's a 5 DVD ""Marx Bros Collection"" coming out in November 03, and the price will be about $25.  So preorder it, and spend the other $280 on your kids!",1066089600,30,304,4.298245614035087
7914570,5,B00001O2GJ,"This is a high quality copy of three Max Brothers classics.  A Night at the Opera, and A Day at the Races would have properly complete the collection but they were from a different studio. At the time of my purchase neither was available on DVD.  These are great movies for the hollidays for those people who are tired of Christmas Story or It a wonderful life.",1005868800,2,361,4.373134328358209
7914571,5,B00001O2GJ,"Sorry about the tacky title.  In any case, the Marx Brothers are hilarious to people of all ages.  When I was a kid I watched these all on VHS because of Harp- and Chic- o's funny slapstick actions.  Now, as a college student lashing out against society, I watch it for Groucho's incredible, biting brilliance.
A Night At the Opera is brilliant.  It has been a long time since I've seen it, though.  One of my favorite lines ever is in there: Groucho and Chico are arguing about contracts and get to a clause about how if one side becomes insane, it shall be void.  ""Yeah, that's the insanity claus"" says Groucho.  ""You can't fool me!"" replies Chico.  ""There ain't no Sanity Claus!""  (Say it out loud.)
Duck Soup is my favorite comedy ever.  It is full of the same brilliance and only too short.  Groucho plays the perfect leader, Chico and Harpo kind of vaguely play spies in some hilarious episodes.  It's funny.  Trust me.
And now, I must ask, ""WHY HAVE THEY DISCONTINUED THIS?""  Surely this is some kind of horrible joke!  Please recontinue it soon!",1000512000,,1053,4.526595744680851
7914572,4,B00001O2GJ,"The quality is as good as I would expect it to be. When you consider that these films were made in and around 1930- it's quite good. They're as good as I could expect to see on TV.
My only issue is that the sound is at a level that's lower than what I use for normal TV channels so I have to crank it up a bit and then it's fine.
Ignore the other reviews about the picture quality- it's fine.",971654400,4,392,3.792682926829268
7914573,1,B00001O2GJ,"Five stars for the films, no doubt about that. But even if I consider the age of these flicks, the DVD-quality is the WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!
  At times you can hardly make out what is happening on screen. I think they  have used an old video taped version, cut out the commercials and  transferred the film to DVD.
 Shame on the makers of these DVD's! My  advice is not to buy them: they are too expensive for what they offer.",941155200,158,429,4.170731707317073
