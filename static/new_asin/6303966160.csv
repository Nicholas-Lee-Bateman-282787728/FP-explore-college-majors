7859737,3,6303966160,"I bought this tape because I wanted to see again the wonderful long program put together by T&D ""Let's Face the Music and Dance"". The tape begins with the beautful ""Bolero"" The show continues with an ""unusual"" choice of music and rather scrappy skating. The lighting and sound left much to be desired. I sat through it waiting for the finale.  As I watched T&D skate I thought, ""if they had skated like this at Lillihammer the judges' scores would have been correct.""",1116460800,10,467,4.626506024096385
