6005510,5,B00FL97FK8,"A touching tribute, with sophisticated storytelling and production. The multidimensional approach, with graphic art, combat footage, first-person accounts, is very effective and moving.",1391817600,2,185,7.086956521739131
6005511,5,B00FL97FK8,"I learned about this video documentary through the Coalition of Families of Korean & Cold War POW/MIAs.  Since my father is a Korean War MIA, and since the proceeds from the sales were going to a good cause, I decided to order this DVD.  I didn't expect much from the DVD, but after viewing it, what I thought would be a run-of-the-mill documentary turned out to be a professionally written, produced, directed and an utterly heart-rendering tribute to Korean War Vets from all services!  Named in honor of the grandfather of the documentary's filmmaker, Conor Timmis, who served in the Korean War, this documentary is one of the best I've seen.  It honors Korean War vets, both living and dead, from each United States service, including African Americans, Chinese Americans and Native Americans who served with distinction.  As a tribute to Korean War veterans everywhere, including my own father who was declared KIA at the end of hostilities ""for the good of the US government"", I strongly recommend this DVD.",1388102400,7,1013,4.935294117647059
6005512,5,B00FL97FK8,"The film captures stories told by the veterans who were actually there.  It is very real and shows some stories and aspects that are not normally shown to the public.  Overall fantastic film that reminds us of the great men and women, American and Korean, that fought during the Korean War.",1387152000,3,290,4.666666666666667

6005535,5,B00FL97FK8,"A very good, limited budget documentary/homage to the soldiers of the Korean War. If you know any history about this war you will recognize and enjoy seeing these medal of honor recipients in person and hearing a small part of their lives. Ignore the 1 star votes. Those same idiots think Call of Duty is really war and mommy's basement is the battlefield.",1480032000,,356,4.666666666666667
6005536,5,B00FL97FK8,I feel that this was an excellent documentary to honor thos who fought and died in the forgotten Korean Conflict?....War! It had a great flow and gave me even greater insight into this important event in US history. Thanks for remembering these American heroes.,1479168000,,261,4.954545454545454

6005542,5,B00FL97FK8,Wow what an amazing tribute to those who fought in the Korean War! This DVD was packed with facts and reenactments of heroic and memorable events. There was factual evidence to back up all stories and those who fought in this war to tell (relive) the stories. The best part of all was the connection to the director. Most documentaries leave out personal stories but Conor Timmis did an phenomenal job of memorializing his fallen family members without taking light from the veterans shown. The one on one interviews with the families of the fallen and the veterans were heart wrenching yet wonderful. They all fought (or family members fought) in a war that isn't well remembered but this DVD helps to commemorate those who gave their lives for this country. All proceeds go to the Coalition of Families of Korean and Cold War POW/MIA's which will help those who helped make this DVD come to life. Truly amazing directing and film making.,1464739200,,939,4.766871165644171
6005563,5,B00FL97FK8,"As a Korean War veteran, I thought the profiles were very good to excellent. And I was particularly taken by the heartfelt gratitude expressed by the young Korean-American woman at the end of the movie for the sacrifices of Americans in saving South Korea as a democratic nation.",1461110400,2,279,4.833333333333333

6005565,5,B00FL97FK8,"Wonderful tribute to all Korean War Veterans - with its interesting vignettes of a cross-section of troops of various ethnicities.  I was pleasantly surprised, as war documentaries typically bore me, but this documentary gives the forgotten war a human perspective. Highly recommend!  And Never Forget!",1406937600,,302,5.688888888888889
6005566,1,B00FL97FK8,"Sucks, Slow as hell! Should have done more research and told a told a story about a real fighting man.",1403395200,,102,4.15
6005567,5,B00FL97FK8,"A good documentary and tribute to the veterans who served.  I really liked that it was mostly interviews, and they are very personal and from the people who lived it.  It's really great to have the interviews focus on the veterans and let them tell their stories.  And there are some really incredible and stunning stories.  I thought it was great that these veterans have a chance to tell us what they experienced, that their stories are recorded in their own words, preserved for history.  It's important that they have a chance to talk about what they experienced, and say what they want to say.

This is NOT a cheesy ""mockumentary"" or over-dramatized piece of schlock, like you see on the History Channel now (ancient history war re-enactments that are largely made-up guesstimations or alien astronaut crackpot stuff).  This is a really well done piece of work, letting the veterans (and others who lived through the Korean War, widows, etc) talk about what they experienced.  It's very moving.

Some of the stories are very sad, and talk about tragedies and horrors experienced, but it's very honest.  And there are really inspirational stories as well.

I would recommend this to anyone who is considering watching it.",1402704000,,1225,4.926829268292683
6005568,5,B00FL97FK8,"Filmmaker Conor Timmis sets out on a year long journey to commemorate the 60th anniversary of The Korean War.
This documentary visits the Heros and Families through various interviews with Veterans and there personal
storys, named in honor of Timmis's late Grandfather the film is held together with genius motion comic cut scenes 'a far better trade than a live action
reconstruction' the haunting soundtrack and narration by Mark Hamill (Star Wars) are just an addition to the accounts of the Directors story and with a low
budget it is plain to see that a lot of hard work and dedication has gone into making this documentary, if you have some or little knowledge of the Korean war
it's still a must see and well worth the purchase.",1402617600,,735,4.75
6005569,5,B00FL97FK8,Wonderfully and tastefully done.  The interviews were excellent and animations got the point across.  I liked the idea that he looked into the minority service members as this was the first military operation with an integrated armed services.  Well worth the money and to share with others.,1402012800,2,291,5.148936170212766
6005570,2,B00FL97FK8,"Did't meet my taste. Found it tedious. That said it comes down to Red car or green,matter of taste I suppose.",1402012800,,109,4.238095238095238
6005571,1,B00FL97FK8,"It was a poorly edited filmed. I appreciated the interviews and the veterans involved- look up Tibor rubins. The insight from these men was a great look on the everyday life and the consequences of war. However, The film was more about the man making it. I was looking forward to spending Memorial Day weekend remembering the soldiers, not a numbnut director. God bless our troops",1400976000,,380,4.7727272727272725
6005572,5,B00FL97FK8,A good movie dedicated to the veterans of the forgotten war. This one has many stories from across our nation that must be heard. check it out.,1395187200,2,143,4.333333333333333
8616648,3,B00FL97FK8,"Enjoyed it, but could have been better.  Would love to see a documentary rememorizing the service of veterans of the Korean ""Cold War"".  There are many more tales of heroism and sacrafice by Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines from after the armistace was signed and well into the late 20th century.  Let's tell their stories too and not forget their service and sacrifices.",1513468800,,376,4.936507936507937

8616650,5,B00FL97FK8,"I'm so glad I watched this!  My grandfather fought in the Korean War, and there are many quality documentaries about that conflict.  This one is definitely unique in that it focuses on several American veterans of that war.  The stories are personal and quite moving.  Thank-you.",1498867200,,279,5.0
8616651,5,B00FL97FK8,"I got this video as a gift. And to be honest, it took me a while to watch it.  This is not a standard war documentary but a memoir/quest of a family member seeking to understand from other Korean War Veterans what is was like. Mix in some color graphics novel images to help tell the ancestor's story and you have ""Finnigan's War.""  For me the mix works in telling the story. The interviews of the veterans is the key to this video.

I have shown this video to my grandchildren and it held their attention. I believe adults and teenagers looking to better understand the Korean War should watch this video.",1496361600,,606,4.392857142857143
8616652,5,B00FL97FK8,"Brought tears to my eyes for many reasons.  Yes, thank you, all of you who served in the Korean War!  This was a beautiful, touching tribute brought to you and for you from a younger generation who sees the sacrifice you made.  Thank you, all you brave soldiers!",1487289600,,262,4.416666666666667
8616653,3,B00FL97FK8,"I love the veterans interviews, but the story seems to minimize the Marine Corps presence and actions during the war.  It truly makes you feel guilty for not honoring these brave warriors, who fought in Korea, in the way that they deserve!",1486339200,,239,4.690476190476191

8616657,5,B00FL97FK8,"I viewed Finnigan's War and was quickly transported back in time to July, 1950, when the telegram arrived informing my family that my brother had been killed at Taejon, Korea.  I had just turned 3 years old and still recall that moment in time.  I will never forget the screaming, shrieking and pandemonium that followed.  My unhealed wound surfaced, I relived that moment, and the sounds of hurt involuntarily escaped my lips.  I wept as the movie played on.

This is a far cry from the traditional Hollywood war movie.  Watch and enter into the Korean War.  See what happened, learn of real men and what they did.  Come to know the cost of War and what followed.",1481673600,,664,4.567796610169491
