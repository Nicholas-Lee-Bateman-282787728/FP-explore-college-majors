8631462,1,B004EL5X5I,This video does not explain several major areas in taxidermy.  It never once tells you anything about what type of adhesive to use on the form to glue the hide which is a major step in all taxidermy.  It fails to tell the viewer to split the tail to salt otherwise you are left with a tail that will not get any salt or tan and will surely slip later on. It also never really goes in to any depth on hair patterns he just vaguely mentions it here and there.,1517875200,,457,4.010989010989011
