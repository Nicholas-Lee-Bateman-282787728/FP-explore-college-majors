As a fan of 2011's Oscar winning foreign language film, ""A Separation,"" I was eager to see director Asghar Farhadi's follow-up.  Like his previous film, ""The Past (Le pass)"" deals with family matters of a similar nature.

Set in a non-descript section of  Paris, Iranian national Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) is returning from Tehran after 4 years to sign divorce papers with his estranged wife Marie (Berenice Bejo).  Surprisingly she has offered him accommodations at her (and his former) house rather than get a hotel.  Their reunion restarts squabbles and bickering that remind each of why their marriage fell apart.

Although they never had children together, Ahmad was stepfather to Lucie (Pauline Burlet), now 16 and defiant of her mother.  There is also a younger sister of about 8.  A young boy of about 9 named Fouad (Elyes Aguis) is also living there.  He is the son of an Arab named Samir (Tahar Rahim) and both are currently living with Marie.  This arrangement and Ahmad's invite certainly seems a bit awkward at best, but Ahmad goes along with it.  Especially after Marie asks him to find out what is bothering Lucie.  Why she stays out until late at night, skips school and rebels against Marie?

Complicating matters further, Samir is still married.  But his wife is in a coma as the result of a suicide attempt.  The why is the central theme of the film.  But this is more than a boilerplate drama.  There is tension and more than a little bit of mystery as the film plays out.  As Ahmad says several times during the movie, it's all a misunderstanding.

For me, the story is more about the children than it is about the adults.  Their actions have serious ramifications on the kids and Farhadi isn't shy about exposing that element.  The kids aren't there just because they are part of the family; they have their own personalities and crosses to bear.  Shot frequently with hand held cameras, the photography feels at times like we're watching a documentary and I think that is the idea.  The film runs a tad long, but is certainly a compelling film.  The actors are truly excellent and that includes some remarkable performances from the younger ones.  See it.",1392595200,,2216,4.7631578947368425
8585278,5,B00CRF4RZA,"B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo plays Marie, a Parisian woman who has unresolved relationships with two Arab men. Her present husband has just returned to France from Iran to see to the finalization of her divorce. They have been separated for several years since he felt the need to return to Iran. He is her second husband.  She had two daughters with a first husband. He was not Arab and her daughters almost look Nordic next to everyone else. The mother is now involved with another Arab man, living in Paris, and wants to marry him. Neither her daughters nor his son are reacting well to all of this domestic upheaval, especially since his wife is in a coma in a nearby hospital. This coma keeps intruding into the story and for good reason.

Tahar Rahim as the Iranian husband is the most likable of all of these characters but that may be because the worst thing he's done is move back to Iran.  As the story unfolds, this is very minor indeed compared to everyone else's acts in the past. Marie and her soon-to-be husband really start to grate on your nerves and then you start finding out more and more about them.

This director and writer has a wonderful understanding of the complexity of human relationships and families.  This is what all of his films are about.  He carefully builds a story around these complex personalities, nuances them with every fine detail imaginable and then brings an emotional powerhouse down on everyone in the 11th hour.
