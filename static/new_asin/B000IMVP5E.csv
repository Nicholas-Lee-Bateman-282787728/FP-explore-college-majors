8146399,1,B000IMVP5E,"The DVD would not load, nor play. I purchased it for class, and students were not able to watch. I was fortunate to find a much abridged news clip that I showed instead. Very disappointed.",1436313600,,188,4.4
8146400,1,B000IMVP5E,There is no sound on this dvd. I was stupid as I had ordered it before and the entire tape had nothing on it.  This time you can see it but there is no sound. Do not order it.,1402531200,,175,3.4871794871794872
8146401,4,B000IMVP5E,I almost forgot what it meant to have a national news network devote so much time to thoughtful discussion on a major issue. We have lost so much in the 24 hour news cycle that focuses on talking points and entertainment reporting.,1395446400,2,231,4.523809523809524
8146402,5,B000IMVP5E,"This product is a compilation of two ""Nightline"" segments concerning Ryan White, the first filmed in 1988 and the second in 1990. Both are very illuminating and insightful, providing a deep look into Ryan's struggles and triumphs, as well as his daily life. While the first is a simple taped interview with him, his mother and a schoolfriend, the second one is particularly good: it shows Ryan at a Q&A session with sixth-graders, and shows how honestly and openly he answered their questions about his experiences. A real treasure - along with his own book, titled ""Ryan White: My Own Story"".
One aspect to note about this product - if you are buying from overseas - is that this DVD is coded for region 1, due to being manufactured in the USA. It did not work on my region 4 DVD player, but did on my (probably) region-free computer DVD drive. As a result, if you do not have a multi-region enabled DVD or Blu-ray player, I would recommend trying it on your computer to see if it works on there.
Although I believe that the DVD itself is excellent, when it arrived the DVD case was badly dented, scratched and cracked. Amazon should definitely pack DVDs and the like in much more sturdy packaging, so that they are not damaged in transit.",1360281600,2,1240,4.565022421524664
8146403,5,B000IMVP5E,"This has to be the best thing I have ever bought. Very informative and inspirational.  Please buy this, it is certainly worth the money.",1329436800,2,136,4.666666666666667
8146404,4,B000IMVP5E,This video is well done for it's time. This was a courageous young man who taught us all a lot. I use this in training my nursing assistant students.,1266105600,2,149,4.172413793103448
8146405,1,B000IMVP5E,"At roughly the 6:30 mark, the DVD fades to black in the middle of a segment and never comes back on. I returned the first one purchased, and the second one did the same thing. In looking at the other reviews, I'm not the only person to experience this. Customer service was wonderful in terms of the return; however, I strongly suspect this batch of DVD's is flawed. I purchased this for classroom use and think it would have been an excellent teaching tool had it worked.",1257120000,2,472,4.436781609195402
8146406,1,B000IMVP5E,I purchased one copy and it didn't work so I returned it and got another. The second copy didn't work either. Both played for about 7 minutes and then played a black screen.,1203465600,5,173,4.2727272727272725
