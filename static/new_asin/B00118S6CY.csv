3063279,5,B00118S6CY,"It is refershing that another country makes the first gay movie with the endorsement of a professional sports team.

Tom Cavanaugh plays Eric, an injured professional hockey player. Sam his lawyer and partner is played by Ben Shenkman. Scot, the orphaned young boy, played by Noah Bernett, is the son of one of Billy (Sam's brother) many girlfriends who dies of a drug overdose and leaves custody of Scot to Billy.

While trying to locate Billy (who happens to be in Brazil), the court dumps custody of Scot to Sam and Eric. Eric is very closeted and masculine about his approach to being gay because he is a sports host on a local TV station. Scot, on the hand, is as effeminated as you can be, emulating the only memory of his mother. Scot disrupts Eric and Sam lives with his funny eccentricities.

The morals of the story are basically that gay parents can be good parents and that you don't need to hide or pretend who you are beacuse that what is the world wants you to be, because deep down inside, everybody knows.

The movie is charming, the kids from Scot's school are lovable (except for the abnoxious kid from across the street, but even with his bigotry, you learn to accept him.) The friends and relatives of Eric and Sam are all understanding and good company. And best of all I love the transformation Eric goes through when Scot comes into his life. Oh yes, Scot is delightful, good acting on all parts.",1242259200,3,1420,4.53515625

unlike most ""gay"" movies, this one is super clean, you won't be embarrassed to show it to your grandmother!  the story is heartwarming, funny, sometimes sad, but very uplifting, shows how opening your heart to change can make life better for everyone around you. TOTALLY different adapatation from the book...i must say i enjoyed the movie better then the book! the screenplay should be published as the updated version! this is a movie the gay community should be very proud of....there is a lesson in this film for everyone who watches it!

3063283,5,B00118S6CY,"Breakfast With Scot is a 2007 film from Canada, that stars Tom Cavanagh as Eric, Ben Shenkman as Sam and Noah Bernett as Scot. It is rare to find such an insightful work that deals with the stereotypes of gay culture. Eric is an ex hockey player and Sam is a lawyer, they are a very conservative couple. Scot recently orphaned after his mother dies from an overdose, is unexpectedly dropped into their lives. He is very flamboyant and the total opposite of his new caregivers. While very funny this gem is also heartwarming, believable and thought provoking. As the story unfolds the three realize that acceptance and love are the glue that binds a family and overcomes all obstacles. Excellent writing, cinematography and casting make this film a must see and earn it the perfect score of a 10. Bravo to Mr. Lynd and the talented cast!",1425945600,,836,4.655405405405405

3063285,2,B00118S6CY,"The film was dull and contrived. I purchased it for the lead  actor Tom Cavanaugh. He was stiff and never into the part. The film skirted around the
fact that they were homosexuals. Not that I am looking for a movie that was based on that premise. However lets not be so coy.
The boy was stiff and never really into the part.

3063287,2,B00118S6CY,"This movie kind of made me mad. Perhaps films of the subject matter have come far but this 7 year old movie feels like it was made in the 90s with the cowardice of the 80s. It's dated, cliche and trite as a late 90s television sitcom/dramedy, which it looks like too. One can see what's coming after the opening scene. People including a guy that doesn't like kids, abruptly get a kid - with issues. Hilarity ensues, lessons are learned in the final 3rd and everyone wraps up to a happily ever after in the last 10 mins. The twist is that the people getting the kid are a closeted gay couple and the kid is a pre-teen gender bending boy. Trust me the theme sounds deeper than this movie is. The film tip-toes gingerly around gay themes, other than a few mentions and innuendos there's barely a sign that the couple have a romantic or physical relationship. Cavanagh's charm and wit didn't come through this more brusque and ashamed character. Perhaps because his character was awkward about himself, Cavanaugh feels out of place in the film. The play on sexual-emotional identity, gender norms, coming out and acceptance are all relevant but played by outdated family comedy style numbers that didn't work for me. The characters felt one dimensional and the comedic elements staged. Cussing kids and shame aren't funny here. Uptick to 2 stars because the happy ending (I saw coming from a mile away) still f'ing made me smile. The main actors are decent and the boy playing the kid is good even if they do overuse his ONE particularly effective facial expression. Maybe inexperienced conventional people might see this highly inoffensive light-hearted movie which could lead them to some progressive thinking afterwards.",1422662400,,1720,4.8141891891891895

Tom Cavanagh is adorkable as always.

 I feel like this is definitely made for families, or people who are uncomfortable with homosexual couples raising kids, in mind.  The title and the breakfasts together in the film seemed like a last minute decision added to get a cutesy name, it wasn't necessarily sucessful at showing a progression of their family relationship...the rest of the storyline took care of that.",1408406400,,678,4.9035087719298245

A simple story of two gay men unexpectedly raising of a young boy is a story of acceptance
on both sides the young Scot who is very comfortable in who he is as a young flamboyant boy learning to live with to gay young men who aren't sure how to handle him,but a love story in learning that we are all different and love and acceptance comes when you least expect it...

3063299,4,B00118S6CY,"You sure have to be in Canada for social services to entrust a boy under ten to a gay couple. But that sounds so natural that no one can complain, except the bigots and there are not very many around.

The child, Scot, should be pitied through and through. The son of a father he does not know, raised by his mother as a girl, his mother dying of an overdose, or in an accident, no one seems to really know or want to know, abandoned by the second man of his mother to whom she had willed the boy along with her comfortable life insurance. The boy is trapped. But no pity please: we've run out of tissues.

Luckily the stepfather being in Brazil, the boy, Scot, has to be entrusted to someone and that's the brother of that ""Brazilian"" stepfather, the brother and his boyfriend.

The film is funny because of the disturbance it introduces into the daily life of these two men who have to learn how to take care of a child, of a boy: take him to school, make him socialize, introduce him to sports and the neighbors, teach him how to fight to defend himself and his reputation when he is accused of being gay (with a nice little ugly word for it) and when the men who are taking care of him are also accused of being gay (with another nice little ugly word for it).

Then the film becomes interesting because the boy, Scot, little by little gets tricked and then trapped in his new life without actually denying what he is or what he feels. He learns how not to kiss everyone, especially the boys, or how not to hug everybody, especially the boys, for no reason whatsoever.

Then the rest you'll have to discover. The ending is slightly mushy because the director wants it to be pink and nice, but it is so improbable that we have to suspend our disbelief so much we get vertigo. But that's all right provided you accept the idea that it is supposed to teach the bigots a lesson. But does it really?

Entertaining though maybe too rosy to be true. But at times in life we need to believe a dream can be true. So enjoy the fun and relax in the entertaining cinematographic Jacuzzi. And don't you take advantage of the situation: there are little boys watching. So keep your hands on the edge of the pool.

3063300,4,B00118S6CY,"Good production values. This is not one of those gay movies produced on a small budget or at least it didn't look like it. The acting was top notch all around. Direction was good. The story was good except for one small point... and it might be considered a spoiler.

SPOILER POSSIBLY: If you read the review, you know most of the story and how the gay couple are closeted in public. What I found weird is how they seem closeted in private. And maybe this is part of Eric's journey of growth. But I found it hard to believe that the only gay thing they do together is ""maybe"" have sex (and I'm not even sure how affectionate that would be). I mean, this couple did not seem like a couple. That was the one thing that struck me odd about the movie. Overall, tho well done and I did like the main storyline of not conforming to gender roles and acceptance.",1324166400,,854,4.2392638036809815

3063302,4,B00118S6CY,"The plot can be seen encapsulated on the DVD box cover. Scot is, by all appearances, as camp as Christmas and comes to live with a discreetly gay couple, creating mayhem as he lives his outrageous normal self, rocking the boat vigorously as he does so. I loved it, and you cannot but warm to the exceptional gusto with which Scot is played. Eric too, as the closet gay former ice hockey jock now a sports commentator, is well played. His partner's character is only lightly sketched. Yes, there are stereotypes, and you have to suspend disbelief in places (the kid would have been torn limb from limb in seconds at school in real life). But you have to have a heart of stone not to smile, at the very least, at the final scenes.

My only carp is that the DVD I bought had no extras (apart from the film trailer which pretty well sets out the entire plot) and no subtitles for the hard of hearing, which I find desirable if, like me, you find it hard to pick out exactly what actors are saying.",1306195200,,993,4.310160427807487
3063303,5,B00118S6CY,"Didn't know what to expect at first.  I enjoy light hearted movies, and this one tops my list at the moment.  There are quite a few unexpected moments, both tender and funny.  The editing is great, the storyline flows well, there's no choppiness - nothing out of place.  The gay couple was devoid of stereo-typing, which was refreshing.  They were were portrayed as an ordinary, every day life couple, who just happen to be gay.  No big deal, just a normal couple.  ""Scot"" gave an incredible performance, as did his unexpected temporary guardians.  A sequel in a few years time would be a great idea, as a continuation of the story.

I understand that the one guy had a problem with public displays of affection, but there were few private displays of affection, almost like they were afraid to show two men affectionate towards each other. Tom Cavanagh is adorable and could be sexy, but not in this film. Also, as a gay parent of a gay son, I have some connection to the story and I felt that some of the action was a bit forced and not realistic, but put there to move the plot along.

3063308,3,B00118S6CY,"I hate to be a spoilsport after all the glowing reviews, but while I enjoyed many
moments, especially the ending sequence, I was put off somewhat by the sitcom
like mood and direction, which undercut the importance of the subject matter.  I
learned about this film as a result of purchasing another gay themed film, ""A Very
Serious Person"", starring Polly Bergen, Charles Busch, and P.J.Verhoest, which
in my view is a far better film dealing with many of the same issues.  And it is
also comedic, but it rarely descends into all-out sitcom style.  Here, a gay male
couple, one a former aggressive hockey player, and the other a lawyer (changed
occupations from the book) become temporary caretakers of the hockey player's
brother's girlfriend's 11 year old son after she dies from a drug overdose.  Of
course neither of the men wanted kids, but they were not expecting a flamboyantly
effeminate boy who loves jewelry and fancy frilly clothes and such.  And you know
that they eventually will wind up keeping the boy, especially when the hockey
player, Eric's, brother is early on revealed as a playboy jerk.  About midway
through, the boy, Sam, well played by Noah Bernett, hoping to win over Eric, agrees
to join up for junior hockey, which of course ultimately doesn't work, and leads
to everyone learning to accept everyone as is.  The use of the real Toronto Maple
Leaf Venue lends some much needed reality, as too many scenes fail to deliver
or go far enough to really deal with the underlying issues realistically, preferring
instead to go for broad or easy laughs or changing the subject completely.  This
had all the ingredients for a great film, but instead settled for a shallow, if
still mostly enjoyable movie.  I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it nearly
as much as I had expected.",1283126400,2,1798,4.755627009646302

Since Scot, the young boy, is obviously gay, to be sent to live with a gay couple could be considered a wise move.

3063316,5,B00118S6CY,"This movie completely charmed me. I bought it because I'm a sucker for anything Canada/hockey-related, but loved it because of the characters, especially Eric (Tom Cavanagh) and Scot (Noah Bernett).

Eric and Sam (Ben Shenkman) are a happy, low-key gay couple.  Eric is an ex-Toronto Maple Leaf tough guy with a new career as a sportscaster, and generally keeps his orientation a secret except from close friends and family.  Sam, a lawyer, would be more comfortable being out publicly, but humors Eric. Their lives are turned upside down when they are given temporary guardianship of ""Sam's brother's dead ex-girlfriend's son,"" Scot.

11-year-old Scot is more flamboyant than either of the men, favoring pink sweater vests, charm bracelets, sparkly headbands and singing Christmas carols at the top of his lungs when he's upset.

Eric ends up being the one to (reluctantly) spend more time with Scot, by virtue of having the more flexible work schedule, and his patience is sorely tested. Scot tends to introduce Eric to strangers by saying ""This is Eric. He's gay"" and twirls in front of mirrors at the mall trying on clothes.  Eric, predictably uncomfortable with both his own orientation being known and with Scot's obvious swishiness, still instinctively stands up for Scot.

Tom Cavanagh as Eric is both very funny and sweet, his exasperation with Scot obvious but his affection for the kid growing despite himself.  Eric has a few missteps along the way as he tries a little too successfully to mold Scot into something ""less gay"", but eventually comes around to the viewpoint that Scot--and he himself--should just be true to themselves.

It's nice to see a gay couple portrayed as just...normal.  Not dumb stereotypes (Will & Grace) or tragically tormented (Brokeback Mountain) or borderline softcore porn (Queer As Folk), but just a functional family unit going about their lives.

And huge props to the National Hockey League and Toronto Maple Leafs to allow their names and logos to be used in a gay-themed movie.  Somehow I doubt we'll be seeing the Yankees or Packers do anything similar any time soon.",1269993600,32,2116,5.0488505747126435
3063317,5,B00118S6CY,"I fell in love with this movie long before the first viewing ended. The story is a bit formulaic at times, so events are predictable, but the characters are so well portrayed, and situations so unique, that it feels fresh.

Eric and Sam are a happy, childless, gay couple. Eric was once a professional hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs (this is the first gay-themed film where a professional sports team allowed the use of their logo). After a serious injury, he retired as a player, settled in with Sam, and got a job as a sportscaster on TV. Eric keeps his relationship and orientation a secret, except from family and friends, and Sam humors him. One day, they find out that Sam's brother Billy gained custody of 11-year-old Scot when the Scot's mother died of an overdose. Billy had dated the mother (Julia) previously, and Julia had never updated her will. Since Billy is nowhere to be found (he's horribly irresponsible), Child Services places Scot with Sam and Eric for a short while. To complicate matters, Scot turns out to be flamboyant and effeminate. While Eric tries to keep his sexuality a secret, Scot draws attention to it, especially since he introduces Eric to people as ""This is Eric. He's watching over me. He's gay."" Keep in mind that Eric is not only a former hockey player, but a former, good, professional hockey player who was a great fighter too.

Tom Cavanagh plays Eric wonderfully well. He's interesting and fun to watch, he gives Eric a great personality, has good comedic timing, and shows his chops with the dramatic scenes. It's a joy to watch Eric gradually go from ambivalence to fatherhood through the course of the film. Noah Bernett is great as Scot (with only one ""T"", since it stops there). Scot exhibits many stereotypical gay characteristics (to an extreme), his actual sexuality is wisely never explored (making the character even more interesting), he's flamboyant, honest, talkative, exuberant, inquisitive... a smorgasbord of characteristics. And Noah Bernett manages to tie it all together and make Scot seem real.

The movie has a nice pace to it. There are ample comic moments with good dramatic moments mingled throughout. The characters are incredibly charismatic, and the overall tone of the movie is very enjoyable. Direction could have been a tad tighter though as some moments didn't play out to their fully potential, but was still good. Though Scot is the most visible character in the movie, the real story is in Eric. Here we have someone who simply wasn't comfortable with having the ""gay"" label attached to him. As he learned to accept Scot, he learned to accept himself. In a sense, it's a coming-out story, but executed so sublimely as to not feel that way. The movie doesn't have a ""political"" feel to it, and doesn't even really come off as a ""gay"" movie. It's just feel-good fun movie. The kind where you can start it at any point, sit back, and enjoy.",1269907200,2,2926,4.801587301587301

It's a joy to watch Eric gradually go from ambivalence to fatherhood through the course of the film. Noah Bernett is great as Scot (with only one ""T"", since it stops there). Scot exhibits many stereotypical gay characteristics (to an extreme), his actual sexuality is wisely never explored (making the character even more interesting), he's flamboyant, honest, talkative, exuberant, inquisitive... a smorgasbord of characteristics. And Noah Bernett manages to tie it all together and make Scot seem real.

The movie has a nice pace to it. There are ample comic moments with good dramatic moments mingled throughout. The characters are incredibly charismatic, and the overall tone of the movie is very enjoyable. Direction could have been a tad tighter though as some moments didn't play out to their fully potential, but was still good. Though Scot is the most visible character in the movie, the real story is in Eric. Here we have someone who simply wasn't comfortable with having the ""gay"" label attached to him. As he learned to accept Scot, he learned to accept himself. In a sense, it's a coming-out story, but executed so sublimely as to not feel that way. The movie doesn't have a ""political"" feel to it, and doesn't even really come off as a ""gay"" movie. It's just feel-good fun movie. The kind where you can start it at any point, sit back, and enjoy.",1269820800,12,2926,4.801587301587301

3297776,5,B00118S6CY,"It is refershing that another country makes the first gay movie with the endorsement of a professional sports team.

Tom Cavanaugh plays Eric, an injured professional hockey player. Sam his lawyer and partner is played by Ben Shenkman. Scot, the orphaned young boy, played by Noah Bernett, is the son of one of Billy (Sam's brother) many girlfriends who dies of a drug overdose and leaves custody of Scot to Billy.

While trying to locate Billy (who happens to be in Brazil), the court dumps custody of Scot to Sam and Eric. Eric is very closeted and masculine about his approach to being gay because he is a sports host on a local TV station. Scot, on the hand, is as effeminated as you can be, emulating the only memory of his mother. Scot disrupts Eric and Sam lives with his funny eccentricities.

The morals of the story are basically that gay parents can be good parents and that you don't need to hide or pretend who you are beacuse that what is the world wants you to be, because deep down inside, everybody knows.

The movie is charming, the kids from Scot's school are lovable (except for the abnoxious kid from across the street, but even with his bigotry, you learn to accept him.) The friends and relatives of Eric and Sam are all understanding and good company. And best of all I love the transformation Eric goes through when Scot comes into his life.

It's dated, cliche and trite as a late 90s television sitcom/dramedy, which it looks like too. One can see what's coming after the opening scene. People including a guy that doesn't like kids, abruptly get a kid - with issues. Hilarity ensues, lessons are learned in the final 3rd and everyone wraps up to a happily ever after in the last 10 mins. The twist is that the people getting the kid are a closeted gay couple and the kid is a pre-teen gender bending boy. Trust me the theme sounds deeper than this movie is. The film tip-toes gingerly around gay themes, other than a few mentions and innuendos there's barely a sign that the couple have a romantic or physical relationship. Cavanagh's charm and wit didn't come through this more brusque and ashamed character. Perhaps because his character was awkward about himself, Cavanaugh feels out of place in the film. The play on sexual-emotional identity, gender norms, coming out and acceptance are all relevant but played by outdated family comedy style numbers that didn't work for me. The characters felt one dimensional and the comedic elements staged. Cussing kids and shame aren't funny here. Uptick to 2 stars because the happy ending (I saw coming from a mile away) still f'ing made me smile. The main actors are decent and the boy playing the kid is good even if they do overuse his ONE particularly effective facial expression.

 I feel like this is definitely made for families, or people who are uncomfortable with homosexual couples raising kids, in mind.

3297796,4,B00118S6CY,"You sure have to be in Canada for social services to entrust a boy under ten to a gay couple. But that sounds so natural that no one can complain, except the bigots and there are not very many around.

The child, Scot, should be pitied through and through. The son of a father he does not know, raised by his mother as a girl, his mother dying of an overdose, or in an accident, no one seems to really know or want to know, abandoned by the second man of his mother to whom she had willed the boy along with her comfortable life insurance. The boy is trapped. But no pity please: we've run out of tissues.

Luckily the stepfather being in Brazil, the boy, Scot, has to be entrusted to someone and that's the brother of that ""Brazilian"" stepfather, the brother and his boyfriend.

The film is funny because of the disturbance it introduces into the daily life of these two men who have to learn how to take care of a child, of a boy: take him to school, make him socialize, introduce him to sports and the neighbors, teach him how to fight to defend himself and his reputation when he is accused of being gay (with a nice little ugly word for it) and when the men who are taking care of him are also accused of being gay (with another nice little ugly word for it).

Then the film becomes interesting because the boy, Scot, little by little gets tricked and then trapped in his new life without actually denying what he is or what he feels. He learns how not to kiss everyone, especially the boys, or how not to hug everybody, especially the boys, for no reason whatsoever.

Then the rest you'll have to discover. The ending is slightly mushy because the director wants it to be pink and nice, but it is so improbable that we have to suspend our disbelief so much we get vertigo. But that's all right provided you accept the idea that it is supposed to teach the bigots a lesson. But does it really?

Entertaining though maybe too rosy to be true. But at times in life we need to believe a dream can be true. So enjoy the fun and relax in the entertaining cinematographic Jacuzzi. And don't you take advantage of the situation: there are little boys watching. So keep your hands on the edge of the pool.

moments, especially the ending sequence, I was put off somewhat by the sitcom
like mood and direction, which undercut the importance of the subject matter.  I
learned about this film as a result of purchasing another gay themed film, ""A Very
Serious Person"", starring Polly Bergen, Charles Busch, and P.J.Verhoest, which
in my view is a far better film dealing with many of the same issues.  And it is
also comedic, but it rarely descends into all-out sitcom style.  Here, a gay male
couple, one a former aggressive hockey player, and the other a lawyer (changed
occupations from the book) become temporary caretakers of the hockey player's
brother's girlfriend's 11 year old son after she dies from a drug overdose.  Of
course neither of the men wanted kids, but they were not expecting a flamboyantly
effeminate boy who loves jewelry and fancy frilly clothes and such.  And you know
that they eventually will wind up keeping the boy, especially when the hockey
player, Eric's, brother is early on revealed as a playboy jerk.  About midway
through, the boy, Sam, well played by Noah Bernett, hoping to win over Eric, agrees
to join up for junior hockey, which of course ultimately doesn't work, and leads
to everyone learning to accept everyone as is.  The use of the real Toronto Maple
Leaf Venue lends some much needed reality, as too many scenes fail to deliver
or go far enough to really deal with the underlying issues realistically, preferring
instead to go for broad or easy laughs or changing the subject completely.  This
had all the ingredients for a great film, but instead settled for a shallow, if
still mostly enjoyable movie.  I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it nearly

3297813,5,B00118S6CY,"This movie completely charmed me. I bought it because I'm a sucker for anything Canada/hockey-related, but loved it because of the characters, especially Eric (Tom Cavanagh) and Scot (Noah Bernett).

Eric and Sam (Ben Shenkman) are a happy, low-key gay couple.  Eric is an ex-Toronto Maple Leaf tough guy with a new career as a sportscaster, and generally keeps his orientation a secret except from close friends and family.  Sam, a lawyer, would be more comfortable being out publicly, but humors Eric. Their lives are turned upside down when they are given temporary guardianship of ""Sam's brother's dead ex-girlfriend's son,"" Scot.

11-year-old Scot is more flamboyant than either of the men, favoring pink sweater vests, charm bracelets, sparkly headbands and singing Christmas carols at the top of his lungs when he's upset.

Eric ends up being the one to (reluctantly) spend more time with Scot, by virtue of having the more flexible work schedule, and his patience is sorely tested. Scot tends to introduce Eric to strangers by saying ""This is Eric. He's gay"" and twirls in front of mirrors at the mall trying on clothes.  Eric, predictably uncomfortable with both his own orientation being known and with Scot's obvious swishiness, still instinctively stands up for Scot.

Tom Cavanagh as Eric is both very funny and sweet, his exasperation with Scot obvious but his affection for the kid growing despite himself.  Eric has a few missteps along the way as he tries a little too successfully to mold Scot into something ""less gay"", but eventually comes around to the viewpoint that Scot--and he himself--should just be true to themselves.

It's nice to see a gay couple portrayed as just...normal.  Not dumb stereotypes (Will & Grace) or tragically tormented (Brokeback Mountain) or borderline softcore porn (Queer As Folk), but just a functional family unit going about their lives.

And huge props to the National Hockey League and Toronto Maple Leafs to allow their names and logos to be used in a gay-themed movie.  Somehow I doubt we'll be seeing the Yankees or Packers do anything similar any time soon.",1269993600,32,2116,5.0488505747126435

Eric was once a professional hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs (this is the first gay-themed film where a professional sports team allowed the use of their logo). After a serious injury, he retired as a player, settled in with Sam, and got a job as a sportscaster on TV. Eric keeps his relationship and orientation a secret, except from family and friends, and Sam humors him. One day, they find out that Sam's brother Billy gained custody of 11-year-old Scot when the Scot's mother died of an overdose. Billy had dated the mother (Julia) previously, and Julia had never updated her will. Since Billy is nowhere to be found (he's horribly irresponsible), Child Services places Scot with Sam and Eric for a short while. To complicate matters, Scot turns out to be flamboyant and effeminate. While Eric tries to keep his sexuality a secret, Scot draws attention to it, especially since he introduces Eric to people as ""This is Eric. He's watching over me. He's gay."" Keep in mind that Eric is not only a former hockey player, but a former, good, professional hockey player who was a great fighter too.

Tom Cavanagh plays Eric wonderfully well. He's interesting and fun to watch, he gives Eric a great personality, has good comedic timing, and shows his chops with the dramatic scenes. It's a joy to watch Eric gradually go from ambivalence to fatherhood through the course of the film. Noah Bernett is great as Scot (with only one ""T"", since it stops there). Scot exhibits many stereotypical gay characteristics (to an extreme), his actual sexuality is wisely never explored (making the character even more interesting), he's flamboyant, honest, talkative, exuberant, inquisitive... a smorgasbord of characteristics. And Noah Bernett manages to tie it all together and make Scot seem real.

The movie has a nice pace to it. There are ample comic moments with good dramatic moments mingled throughout. The characters are incredibly charismatic, and the overall tone of the movie is very enjoyable. Direction could have been a tad tighter though as some moments didn't play out to their fully potential, but was still good. Though Scot is the most visible character in the movie, the real story is in Eric. Here we have someone who simply wasn't comfortable with having the ""gay"" label attached to him. As he learned to accept Scot, he learned to accept himself. In a sense, it's a coming-out story, but executed so sublimely as to not feel that way. The movie doesn't have a ""political"" feel to it, and doesn't even really come off as a ""gay"" movie. It's just feel-good fun movie. The kind where you can start it at any point, sit back, and enjoy.",1269907200,2,2926,4.801587301587301

3297817,5,B00118S6CY,"This is a beautiful story that is touching, hilarious, dramatic, and makes us look at things in ways we haven't before.  I'm a huge Tom Cavanaugh fan and he is excellent in his role of an ex-hockey player/sportscaster who for seemingly obvious reasons can't come out of the closet. His and his partner's quiet, enjoyable life turns upside down in a sudden turn of events, and watching all of the characters come to grips with it is a lot of fun and has a lot of heart.  Serious kudos go out to the kid playing ""Scot (with one t)"" who is just the most endearing, honest, and open young actor.  You seriously do not want this movie to ever end.  My mom loved it too (we saw it at a film festival together) and had to have her own copy and it has been watched quite a few times.  Every time as wonderful as the first.",1246060800,2,814,4.1923076923076925

Tom and his partner made it clear that you don't have to wear you gay membership badge to be gay at all, infact in the beginning of the movie, he was always trying to insinuate that his private life is what it is, private. Scot was just a little mess but adorable too. I loved it.",1242604800,2,376,4.164383561643835

8241019,2,B00118S6CY,Two straight actors who barely show any on screen affection pretend to be a gay couple in name only.  The young actor is the only thing watchable in this after school made for t.v. special. Blah!,1505260800,,195,4.416666666666667
8241020,4,B00118S6CY,"Brimming with a bubbly and capable cast, ""Breakfast with Scot"" is just what you may need to lift your spirits, especially around Christmas.  Although on-screen couple and main characters Tom Cavanagh (""Eric"") and Ben Shenkman (""Sam"") look like they could be related, there's an undeniable pervading charm here when we discover that Sam's brother Billy's (Colin Collingham) ex-girlfriend passes, leaving custody of young Scot (Noah Bernett) in her will to ever-absent non-biological father figure Billy and therefore forwarding temporary custody of Scot to Sam, basically an uncle figure, and Eric.  Familiar-looking faces abound:  Cunningham bares a striking resemblance to 1980's fleeting movie star Pauley Shore; the actress who plays the school principal looks like Cloris Leachman; and I hardly recognized now-grown Megan Follows (TV's ""Anne of Green Gables"") as a Child Protective Services rep here.  There are minor weak links, however, like the young actor who plays ""Joey Morita,"" who, respectfully, obviously lacks acting experience, seemingly requiring quite an effort to recite his lines.  Moreover, there's some unnecessary foul language (mostly by minors) and the movie itself could be construed as perpetuating homosexual stereotypes in that Scot is gay; therefore, the movie-makers apparently felt that he must be portrayed as effeminate, poodle belt and all (then again, the leads go against type).  And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see how this will end (especially in movie land), but you truly come to care for virtually every character (even Joey) because each has a personality distinctly their own and you truly want Scot to be happy as the film reaches its expected feel-good conclusion as part of its better-world scenario, in a well-made movie that teaches tolerance and acceptance, with dashes of drama and wit, from our friends in Canada.  Another good sign:  It improves with each viewing.",1482796800,,1926,5.418060200668896

8241025,5,B00118S6CY,"A very heart warming story of a boy, Scot, who becomes the ward of two gay men. One of the men is the brother of Scot's late mother's boyfriend, who is ""unavailable"". By default the two men become Scot's guardians. Scot happens to be gay also, flamboyantly so. The other gay man in the relationship is a professional hockey player. At first he's put off by Scot's effiminate mannerisms. But he takes Scot under his wing and teaches him how to play hockey. Scot learns to play the game very well. He's still flamboyant but has developed a ""butch"" side to him as well.

I won't give away the ending. Suffice to say the movie ends very happily.",1426550400,,641,4.432203389830509
