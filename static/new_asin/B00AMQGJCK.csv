5451648,5,B00AMQGJCK,"Fans of Karel Riesz will want to own Who'll Stop The Rain, an underrated and under-appreciated Vietnam-era drama.  Riesz, who wrote THE book on film editing, shows off his cutting skills here, and for that the DVD-R is worth buying.  But, the real reason to buy this DVD is for Nick Nolte's hair.  That's right.  In not a single successive shot does his hair remain the same as in the previous, with some AMAZING coifs.  This is an important addition to the Vietnam movie canon, as well as Riesz's filmography.  Amazon does it again with their burn-to-order service!",1433289600,2,566,4.724489795918367

5451653,5,B00AMQGJCK,I have both these movies(Rush and Who'll Stop The Rain) in my collection of films. Both are great movies at their time and still great movies now to watch.

Just nice set of movies to have in your own collection of films.,1388534400,,334,4.075757575757576
5451654,5,B00AMQGJCK,"Admittedly I have not yet watched ""Rush"".  I ordered this because I wanted ""Who'll Stop the Rain"".  I saw it in the theater when it first came out and loved it.  I have already watched it twice and it is still absolutely epic.  Another great product at a great price from Amazon.",1381795200,6,279,4.3076923076923075

8554033,4,B00AMQGJCK,Mainly bought this for Who'll Stop the Rain which I used to watch on cable many years ago. I'd seen Rush also a good very gritty film. Jennifer Jason Leigh is an all time favorite of mine so that was even better.  Back to Rain it's a solid thriller with friendship the main plot device driving the films narrative. Nick Nolte is great as the man entangled in an illegal drugs run started by his friend played by Michael Moriarty.  When unsavory thugs come looking fir the drugs Nick ends up fleeing with Michael's wife played by Tuesday Weld. Weld is very good in her role as the most reluctant participant in this story. Lots of intense action and a sad ending I won't spoil for you. Nice idea packaging 2 drug centered film together and it's a very worthwhile purchase.,1518307200,,771,4.460992907801418
