8656010,5,B00K5KO7ZO,I love this fun workout! It works you out while you are dancing! It is fun and you get a variety of different moves to learn and enjoy while increasing your heart rate and working out your muscles. The instructor really pushes you and motivtes you to make it to the final stretch. I look forward to dancing to this dvd and getting my cardio in for the day. I would highly recommend.,1428969600,,382,4.2465753424657535
