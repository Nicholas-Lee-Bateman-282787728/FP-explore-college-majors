8479395,1,B005MJCB0G,"This is far from being the ultimate collection. It contains the two WWE releases of the revived DX that started in the mid 2000's or so. As well as the story of Triple-H and HBK in two documentaries not done well at all. So, where is the original DX release? Why was that not included? And when is WWE going to finally release a proper DX video that tells the story from start to finish, not a highlight reel, or play by play of everything that has happened since the revival. This is by far, NOT the best of DX. How can the nWo who did 4 things in history before messing everything up get a 3 disc release? Yet DX fans have been asking for about 10 years now when they will be getting a decent DX release with the complete history, not just parts of it.",1370476800,2,754,4.101351351351352
8479396,4,B005MJCB0G,"This is a special collectors pack where various past DVD sets are put together as one with a common theme & in this case, it's the group of D-Generation X of Shawn Michaels & Triple H.  It should be noted that these are the regular versions of the DVD sets & not the Blu-Ray.

The New & Improved DX:
This is an anthology of matches & segments that follow the reunion of Shawn Michaels & Triple H as D-Generation X back in 2006.  Throughout the DVD set, you don't actually hear from DX themselves but others such as Mr. McMahon, Spirit Squad, John Cena, and others but they are all ""in character.""  Various matches include their tag matches matches against Spirit Squad (Vengeance, Saturday Night's Main Event, The McMahons (SummerSlam) & Big Show (ECW) including their Hell In A Cell match (Unforgiven), Rated RKO (Cyber Sunday), William Regal & Mr. Kennedy & Finlay, Lance Cade & Trevor Murdock, and their ""Team DX vs. Team Rated RKO"" Survivor Series elimination match.  DX also had singles matches on this set against Shane McMahon, Mr. McMahon, Umaga, and Randy Orton.

The backstage segments & promos shown include the official DX reunion, their impersonations of the McMahons, the night DX was banned from RAW, DX leaving their mark on everything Vince owned, the night they took over RAW, Rated RKO's impression of DX, their confrontation with Eric Bischoff, the night Jonathan Coachman put a bounty on DX, and the commercials for New Year's Revolution & SummerSlam in the DVD extras.

DX - One Last Stand:
This set chronicles the final run of DX from 2009 to early 2010 (under the persona of ""The DX Army""), which also just also happened to be the final year of Shawn Michaels' wrestling career, through various matches & promos & backstage segments with Shawn & Triple H hosting the set ""in character"" while walking through a military base.  Various matches include their battles against Legacy (SummerSlam & Hell In A Cell), Randy Orton & Chris Masters, JeriShow (T.L.C. & 3 matches on RAW), Hart Dynasty (RAW & SmackDown), Big Show & Chavo Guerrero, a triple threat match against ShowMiz & Straight Edge Society, and a six man tag with Hornswoggle vs. ShowMiz & actor Jon Heder.

All the segments involving Hornswoggle leading up to him becoming the DX mascot are included along with other ones such as Triple H finding Shawn leading to the reformation of the group once again, DX interacting with the RAW Guest Host (Bob Barker, Ozzy Ozborne, Mike Tyson, Jon Heder & Don Johnson) & other stars (Vince McMahon's birthday party, Dusty Rhodes, Santino Marella).  The biggest highlight of this set though is that you get the complete unedited retirement speech from Shawn Michaels the night after WrestleMania.

Triple H: King Of Kings
This was the last solo set on Triple H released back in 2008 which was in the format of an anthology hosted by Triple H showcasing his matches with comments in between on various incidents such as getting started in the business, time in WCW, Chyna, the curtain call, King Of The Ring including a funny story about the ""crown"" itself, the evolution (no pun intended) of his character, his quad injury, Shawn's return, Ric Flair, Batista, Edge & John Cena amongst other things. Hidden extras also include an early Hunter Hearst Helmsley vignette & one of the ""We Can Re-Build Him"" video packages leading to his return at SummerSlam '07.
Various matches include his RAW debut in 1995, his first championship victory against Intercontinental Champion Marc Mero, King Of The Ring finals against Mankind that (King Of The Ring '97), a European Title defense against Owen Hart (WrestleMania XIV), his first WWE Championship win against Mankind, a No Holds Barred match against Steve Austin (No Mercy '99), two Hell In A Cell matches against Cactus Jack (No Way Out '00) & Batista (Vengeance '05), 3 Stages Of Hell Match against Shawn Michaels (Armageddon '02), Last Man Standing Match vs. Ric Flair (Survivor Series '05), and a triple threat match against John Cena & Edge (Backlash '06) with his first wrestling match in 1992 & the Hog Pen match against Henry Godwinn (""In Your House"" Dec. '95) included in the DVD extras.

Shawn Michaels: My Journey
This is the final (to date) Shawn Michaels DVD set that is in the same as Triple H's where the only person you'll hear from is the profiled wrestler himself, which is Shawn in this case (with Michael Cole interviewing him), while also watching a series of his high profile bouts along with some rare & forgotten ones. Some of subjects you'll hear Shawn talk about in between matches include his early career in World Class & AWA, who intimidated him when he first game to WWE, analyzing the tag team division during his time as part of the Rockers, how he felt he was able to have good matches with anyone, how he didn't like the ""Boyhood Dream"" story behind his first title reign, what memories made him say ""I'm sorry"" to Michael Cole, the blowup he had at the WrestleMania XIV press conference, his relationships with certain wrestlers, the one person that made him go ""I'm going to have to train harder than I usually do"", his relationship with the fans in Canada, and his personal life such as his children.
Various matches include a match from World Class Championship Wrestling vs. One Man Gang, his AWA matches with Marty Jannetty as the Midnight Rockers against Nasty Boys along with Buddy Rose & Doug Summers, tag matches as part of the Rockers against Brain Busters & Hart Foundation, an Intercontinental Title match vs. Bret Hart, European Championship Match vs. British Bulldog (One Night Only '97), two matches vs. Undertaker (WrestleMania 25) including the casket match that injured his back so bad that he had to retire (Royal Rumble '98), two matches vs. Chris Jericho (WrestleMania XIX & Unforgiven '08), Ric Flair (Bad Blood '03), Kurt Angle (WrestleMania 21), and two matches against Randy Orton (Survivor Series '07) including a fatal four way that also featured John Cena & Edge (Backlash '07).  Also included are various matches matches from ""RAW"" against British Bulldog (Mar. '95), Sid (Sept. '95), 1-2-3 Kid (Mar. '96), Mankind (Sept. '97), his Boot Camp Match vs. Triple H from the Tribute To The Troops show (Dec. '05), and a heel promo he did in Montreal during his feud against Hulk Hogan in August of 2005.

The two DX DVD's were more about just following DX through the two runs in WWE as a team with some quality matches (but not many) being mixed in with some funny backstage skits & promos (depending on your sense of humor).  The solo sets on Shawn & Triple H were more about quality as far as in-ring action & classic matches go.  Your getting four different DVD sets (11 disc total) for a cheaper price than you would get buying each set individually so your a fan of DX then this is a no-brainer if you already don't have the sets but if you have a heavy preference of having high quality matches over sets that are more about comedy skits & following storylines & promos then I would suggest buying the two sets separately (both DX ones or HHH & HBK's solo sets) that would appeal to your preference.",1322092800,,7129,4.755663430420712
