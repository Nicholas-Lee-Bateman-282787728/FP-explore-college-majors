8179233,5,B000NLBYYM,"I have been doing the yamuna body rolling total body routine which includes the Back, abdomen, upper chest and shoulders and got the leg rolling tape also...
I have the red, green and yellow balls as well as the foot savers.
I also have the book and picked up the sideline routine from it.
These workouts are great for stretching and toning. Also if I do before bed I sleep really well.
I learned from the books and tapes, have never taken the classes. There is a learning curve. At first I was tentative and tense and didn't get as much out of it. Follow the instructions and master one routine fully before trying the others.
Now am thinking of getting the sideline and more advanced ab routine tapes...",1231286400,,705,4.4728682170542635
