8760802,4,B01FHTHJKW,"Very good pair of so-bad-it's-good (actually bad) low-budget late 50's early 60's horror flicks.
Monstrosity (aka The Atomic Brain) is about a rich old woman who has hired a Dr. Frankenstein-type scientist to transplant her brain into a beautiful young body.  Of course everything hits the fan.
Teenage Zombies is about a gaggle of teens who end up on an isolated island being used by bad guys planning to take over the USA by zombiefying everyone.  Some of the music is taken from the film It! The Terror from Beyond Space.
The quality of Monstrosity is very good, but the Something Weird DVD release (under the title The Atomic Brain) is pretty similar in quality.  Also the SW version has a lot of extras.  Teenage Zombies is very good quality, better than the older Retromedia single DVD release from several years before.  This Double Feature has some extras for Teenage Zombies.
Recommended for fans of the genre.",1491696000,2,919,4.828025477707007
