8679821,1,B00NQGGFUY,"""Until there is Biblical authority, there has to be some controlling authority in our society and there is none.""
-Pat Robertson

Actually, Pat, there is controlling authority in our society. It's called constitutional government. It isn't the kind of authoritarian control you advocate, because democracy and civil rights are meant to protect us from authoritarian control. If you want to be governed by Biblical authority, that's your right. But it isn't your right to impose your own version of ""controlling authority"" on the rest of us.",1507334400,,540,5.27906976744186
