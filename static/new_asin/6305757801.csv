7894607,3,6305757801,"This video was mediocre, if anything. It was also very disappointing. There is absolutely NO music of theirs on this tape, and NO interviews with the band, which is really pathetic. I was very upset after I watched the  whole tape and saw none. Basically this video captures interviews with  people that worked with Limp Bizkit before/after/during their fame. There  are interviews with the manager of the place Fred was a tattoo artist,  there is an interview with the head of the Milk Bar, the place they first  played. There's lots of interviews with fans, and also an interview with  Fred's ex girlfriend! But she looks so young, it's as if she couldn't even  have been his girlfriend!",957571200,16,689,4.788135593220339
