If you enjoy the ocean surf and sea birds this makes you feel as tho' your there while living in the mid-west. It would be great for people with sleep problems. I love the sea side, but only get to go there every two years or so. Now I can get the sounds and sights of the ocean any time. It also brings to mind pleasant memories I've made while at the sea side.
