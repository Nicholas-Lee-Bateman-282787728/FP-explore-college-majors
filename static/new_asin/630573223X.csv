It reflects the pure love that croosing the different of society's class amoung them. I feel the leading actress(led by Wu Chien Lien)'s performance is pure and so natural which can make audiences believe and feel in her role about this kind of love.
This movie is really much worthy for people whom believe in love.",1069977600,,418,4.739726027397261
7893751,1,630573223X,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers saw in this film.  From the overly dramatic soundtrack (that virtually beats you into submission and overstates what's happening in the movie) to the slow script, to the predictable ending, this was a real stinker.  Being a die hard HK movie buff I had to fight my desire to turn this off mid way through the movie.  And this coming from an Andy Lau fan.  I did enjoy the main characters and the acting from them was pretty good. Having said that, every thing else about the movie stunk.  Unless you like bloody noses (the bloody nose of all movie bloody noses) don't waste your money on this one.",1013904000,,635,4.439655172413793
7893752,3,630573223X,"Supposed to be a classic.  It's not all bad, but is highly predictable and overdramatic.  If you can except it for what it is, it does what it means to.",1010534400,,152,4.033333333333333
7893753,5,630573223X,"I first saw this movie on a local 'foreign movies' channel. Not being able to get hold of the name of the movie... i spent many long months trying to find its title and in eventually doing that, i had to go on another search to find stores that actually stocked this movie. Quite simply... this is a truely great movie. The characters really grow on you, and the story is quite emotionally involving. Its the sort of movie that keeps you up at nights because you just cant escape the glowy feeling that almost attatches itself to you. This movie is pretty much perfect. Buy it and you won't regret it.",990230400,5,601,4.375
7893754,5,630573223X,"This movie was so incredibly romantic.  If you don't mind watching some blood and gore (after all, the main character in the movie is a member of the triad and lives a tough lifestyle)-- this is the movie to watch.  The  love that develops between Wah Dee and JoJo from the moment they cross  paths until the ending is so beautiful, it will linger with you for a long  time.",953078400,2,374,4.285714285714286
7893755,5,630573223X,"Andy Lau has specialised in his clueless triad roles, but this is the rare one that really hits the mark. Instead of just being the aimless brute he has sometimes portrayed, Moment of Romance really gives him an excellent  chance to shine.  The plot follows Wah Dee as he is persuaded to be a  getaway driver for the dangerous Trumpet (Tommy Wong). After the police  stumble upon the robbery, Wah Dee uses an innocent girl as a hostage to  ensure the safe escape of himself and his contemparies. Trumpet insists  that she could identify them and should be killed. Dee, however, preserves  her and a bond develops between them. However, with Trumpet seeking to take  over the gang, Wah Dee is soon in danger alongside his new-found love.  This film really touches the heart with its skillful development of the  characters and the gradual love between the doomed lovers. Wu Chien Lien is  innocence personified and her performance really lingers in the memory.  Unmissible.",951436800,9,972,4.859756097560975
