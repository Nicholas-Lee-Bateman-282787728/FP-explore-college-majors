3174718,5,B0017PB5W4,"This film was creepy as hell! I got goosebumps on more then one occasion. The dark tone of the film really grabs you and sucks you in. Props to the writer/director Sean Tretta on this film as it really is a cut above any lame ghost TV series or lousy haunting film.

True evil comes from those who claim to have such a righteous existence. Right-wing conservative Christians are far scarier than any monster or psychopath fictionally created for a film. Real life ""evil"" stems from those who try to impose their, or god's, will onto others. That is what is so unsettling about this film, the fact that this evil lives on your street, in your town, and you cannot escape it.

Check out Mr. Tretta's new film ""The Death Factory Bloodletting"" due out early 09'. A simple Google search will bring plenty of information. GREAT FLICK!!!",1215993600,6,830,4.601351351351352
3174719,1,B0017PB5W4,"This story begins promisingly with a young parapsychologist leaving her home in Salem, Oregon and driving to Arizona to investigate a supposedly haunted house.  She gets the scoop from a relative who briefly relates the story of the slain Mastersons. We already know about the killings because of an attention-grabbing opening sequence. The lady doc and three accomplices settle in for the spooky doings.  The other three ghost hunters are a TV cameraman with a bunch of equipment that seems to break down in key places, an ethnic newspaper woman from the town, and an apparently eccentric young woman who is having problems with her periods.
With the introduction of the young woman, problems begin with the storyline.  She is supposedly an ardent Christian because she carries her Bible around and keeps saying that the Mastersons were good people and the ghost hunters are wretched vile heathens trying to tear their image apart.
As the apparitions become more noticeable and the living characters become more irritable from lack of sleep, we learn through visions and accidental discoveries that the Masterson family was truly disturbed.  In a lengthy explanatory passage at the end, the ""whole story"" is brought out.  Whether you accept it or not depends on your reaction to the movie to this point.
This movie plays as a combination of Blair Witch, The Exorcist, and Casper the Friendly Ghost.  I did not get the creepy disembodied feeling that these other-worldly apparitions were truly harmful, although one of them has a problem with anger management.  We know pretty much what happened because of the opening sequence.  This leaves us focusing on the people in the present, and they are not a promising lot.
The young woman parapsychologist follows the time honored pattern of the spiritual guru who has all the answers.  She sometimes sounds like the diminutive exorcist in Spielberg's ""Poltergeist.""  The TV cameraman smokes a lot and often says, ""You better come down and see this,"" and ""My battery just went dead."" He is the only male in an otherwise entirely female drama. He is much more interesting when he is looking through his camera than when the camera is on him. The ethnic news reporter is there for her filthy language and arguments with the young Christian zealot. The real problem, however, is this crazy young woman who is supposed to represent the church that the Mastersons attended.  She is vacuous, irritating and purposeless, but as the movie progresses, she steals center-stage from the ghost hunters.  Trouble is, there really isn't anything ""in"" this character except her lunatic-fringe Christian diatribes.
It may be true in this politically correct world that ethnic minorities and the mentally and physically challenged are not proper objects of ridicule.  This seems to leave Christians as fair game.  In an adaptation of one of Stephen King's novels (The Fog), the chief antagonist is another Bible-spouting fanatic.  As we learn in the Masterson saga, the lord of the manor is a hypocritical sex-fiend, and his wife is a repressed, neurotic psycho who makes love with her head in a box.  However, these revelations, which should carry some conviction and drama, seem to be thrown in just to make the movie more lurid.  Yeah, yeah:  Christians are all a bunch of hypocrites.  (And they tend to agree and say, ""There's always room for one more!) So what?  Is this the purpose of the movie:  Christian bashing?  It's the old wacko, hypocritical, Bible-thumping, fire-and-brimstone caricature that's been around since the Pilgrims landed.
Therefore, I believe that the central aspect of the movie, the damn-the-hypocritical Christians, is lame,easy, soft, cheesy, unconvincing, you name it.  It's always easier to stereotype people rather than create real, three-dimensional characters.  The movie takes an easy way out.
We become involved with characters when we understand them and identify with them.  Caricatures are just that:  two dimensional targets which pander to people's prejudices.
This house is supposedly one of the ten most haunted houses in America.  This movie is haunted by bad acting, poor character development, stereotyping and aimlessness.  The so-called explanation doesn't really explain anything.  And why isn't this key character wandering around the house?  She should feel right at home with the other crazy, two-dimensional fanatics.",1215734400,8,4400,5.2

the plot

In Queen Creek, Arizona, the family of Minister Joseph Masterson was murdered inside their home on the night of October 10th, 1982. The murder was carried out by Mary Beth, the wife of Joseph Masterson. Police investigations officially state the murders are unsolved, due mainly to the suicide note left by Mary Beth claiming this to be true.

Almost twenty years later to the day, nephew of Minister Joseph, Seth Masterson decided to hire a paranormal expert to investigate whether this house was haunted. There have been reports from the maid who dusts once a month at the Masterson house, as well as a gardener of ghost sitings. He offered Carter Simms $5000 to investigate the house and report her findings either way. Unbeknownst to Carter, she was to be accompanied by a videographer named Colin Green, a journalist name Yvette Sandoval and an overseer from the church where Minister Joseph used to work, her name is Mary Young Mortenson. Her position here was to make sure that the good name of the church or the good Masterson name were not speciously misrepresented by the heathen ghost hunter.

Carter Simms arrived in Arizona and went into the home on October 17th, 2002. She used her paranormal electronic measuring devices as well as Colins handheld and stationary cameras in order to find proof of any paranormal activity. Even on the first night, they found some evidence to support a haunting. In one room, the temperature was unexplainably 20 degrees cooler and there were chairs moving by themselves. The next day they reviewed their audio and video recordings which led to further evidence of ghosts occupying this residence.

Somehow, they still needed proof to gather. This turned into a murder investigation of Mary Beth Masterson as the ghastly pieces of evidence kept piling on. Very creepy happenings were experienced by all three of the professional guests, and there seemed to be something almost as creepy about the church girl Mary Young. We know what happens to Carter Simms from the movie title, but how and why will Carter Simms lose her life in this haunted house? Find out when you watch Death of a Ghost Hunter.

the breakdown

Going into this film, I imagined it to be almost a waste of time. A low-budgeted indie that will fall short to impress and worse than this, fail to scare me. About ten minutes into the movie, I was smug with confirmation. The brainless incidental music contrasted with Patti Tindalls (the actress who plays the lead  Carter Simms) voice over narration had the smack of amateur as far as the audio was concerned as well as the presentation. Yet, as the cast fully assembled into the haunted house, it began coming together. Sure, there was still the sound of stupid music (provided by the writer Mike Marsh) that constantly played in the background, but even this started making sense as the film progressed. The music is a blatant rip-off of the slightly more effective soundtrack of 1978s Halloween, which the music was coincidentally penned by film writer John Carpenter.

As far as ripping off other films, its pretty blatant as far as having connections to movies like Amityville Horror, and it even goes so far as deliberately quoting Poltergeist, The Exorcist and Blair Witch Project. The independent, low-budget aspect of the film certainly recalls Blair Witch, but they still managed to offer up some effective special effects. The ghostly beings may raise the hair on your arms in the same way it had done to mine. Despite the title there was also a bit of unpredictability, and the film also exudes an aura of danger within the house and the history of the murders.

This being said, there was some trouble with the writing. Not with the story mostly, but with the mundane conversations between the four characters. The very liberal-minded writers Mike Marsh and Sean Tretta made every Christian character in the film a villain. Mary Young is the typical Hollywood-invented, closed-minded Christian individual with tendencies toward overt bigotry toward anyone who isn't Christian or Caucasian. She even comments about the neighborhood going downhill as there were more blacks moving into the area. Please, Louise! I expect a little more open-mindedness from my independent films, I mean come on, this isn't a Stephen King flick for goodness sakes! Then again, the mindset of the country at the time of release in 2007 was very anti-Bush who in some ways epitomizes these characteristics. Had this been a bit different if it were released today when the country is waking up to what progressivism really is, remains to be seen.

For a low budget movie, Im guessing that most of the monies went into a couple of nude scenes from at least three actresses. Lindsay Page, April Hinojosa, and Sarah Lawton each practically bared all for the film. This film was not rated, I guess because it went straight to video, and aside from the nudity there is plenty of profanity throughout the movie. Saving some money may have went into casting music director/script writer Mike Marsh in the role of videographer Colin Green. Mike Marsh had some really funny one-liners much in the way Hud had in Cloverfield (who was also videographer by the way) which was released about a year later.

The ending was what sealed the deal for me. Not only was I scared, but now the film actually gave me chills. An imaginative twist was placed at the end which surprised me at least, and effected me in a truly creepy way. So despite the spotty acting, the usual characterization assassinations, and the shoddy music, this film does what it promises, it scares you  the viewer. Take a chance and check this out, my guess is that you're probably going to like it  if you're a horror movie fan that is.

3174728,3,B0017PB5W4,"Most important thing to know about this movie is that despite the poor acting in parts, and the sound being too quiet or too loud at times, the movie can be enjoyed for the story it tells. At first I wanted to find something else to watch cause the acting was pretty bad at times, but fairly quickly I decided to give it a shot because a few things piqued my interest and in the end I was glad I did. If they had a larger budget I imagine this movie would be very well received, and even cutting out a few scenes could get rid of the really hideous acting.

Bottom line is if you're a fan of the genre and the style then give it a go and focus on the narrative, just let it tell you the story without any expectations and you should enjoy it. One other thing of note, the sound isn't well equalized, some parts the volume is too low to hear anything so you turn it up, only to find that a few seconds later there's a loud part that gets way too loud. Just keep the remote handy to adjust the volume when needed.

3174737,2,B0017PB5W4,"Death of a Ghost Hunter (Sean Tretta, 2007)

I really wanted to like Death of a Ghost Hunter, the first feature from Sean Tretta; the next year, he released The Death Factory Bloodletting, a slasher flick that never takes itself too seriously and ends up being a stupidly good time because of it. This movie, however, does not have that same attribute, while richly needing it; while it does have a few good-but-predictable twists, Tretta was still finding his cinematic feet here, and the end result is somewhat less than it should have been.

Death of a Ghost Hunter is the story of Carter Simms (Machined's Patti Tindall), a paranormal investigator who's been hired to check out a house notorious for the mass murder of the family who lived there twenty years ago. When she and her cameraman Colin (Mike Marsh, who returned for The Death Factory Bloodletting) arrive, they discover an unpleasant surprise waiting for them in the form of Yvette (The Devil's Playhouse's Davina Joy), an investigative reporter who's as interested to get the full story on Carter Simms as she is to find out whether the house is haunted. As if that's not enough, a spiritual advisor, Mary (Lindsay Page in her only screen appearance to date), shows up later the first night to do some Bible-thumping. It's a motley crew indeed, almost as if the homeowner hand-picked these folks to play off one another. (You saw this more recently in Episode 50.) When creepy things start happening, the crew try to get to the bottom of what actually happened in the house and whether there are ghosts haunting it.

There are some very interesting pieces to this plot (warning: the backstory of the house ends up containing a lot of triggering stuff), and Tretta, in his first collaboration with screenwriter Mike Marsh, had some good ideas about where to go. Both of those upsides were hamstrung by the obviously low budget they were working with and the caliber of some of the acting (there's a reason, one assumes, Page has only ever appeared in one movie). Given that Tretta has since shown himself capable of better when he's got even a slightly larger budget, it might be an interesting exercise for, say, Megan Ellison to toss fifty grand at him and see what a remake of this would look like with some professional actors (and a few better effects). What's here is heavy on potential, light on execution. **",1400457600,2,2381,4.760290556900727

So, that part of the script is dumb. Why the writer couldn't just have had a whole team investigate is beyond me. It would, for me, have made the whole thing more believable.

The acting is bad. Probably the best actor is the video guy. The lead actress is so bad, it makes the whole film suffer. I understand this is a ""mockumentary,"" but still, using some better actors wouldn't have hurt. Again, this movie would have benefited by having as part of the premise, a paranormal investigative team. The worst actress is the ""writer,"" and what is she doing there, anyway? The screenwriter could have at least made her an assistant to the video guy, or something.

I could go on, but I'm pretty much just echoing what others have said.

Next, the sound was just horrible.  I could barely hear the dialogue, but when music played or when the characters were outside the sound level jumped up annoyingly.

The story is extremely predicable and one of the characters did not fool me at all as to who she was.

One reviewer believes that nobody else has ever thought of this concept. Well, either that is not true, or else it is but it was executed so poorly that the predictability factor ruined the entire story.

I was able to sit thru it somehow, so that is worth at least one star to me, but in the end I think it was more because I don't believe in bailing out on a movie I begin to watch.

3174755,3,B0017PB5W4,"A team of four are investigating a haunted house. Carter (Patti Tindall) is a skeptical ghost hunter who leads the group. Her tools are a digital thermometer, EMF detector (great at detecting nuclear blasts), sound recorder, and irritating first person narration filled with creative 101 phrases such as ""ominous foreboding"" and ""retain the darkness."" Colin (Mike Marsh- writer, producer, and composer of said film) is the bald camera man who gives himself a ""7"" out of ""10"" or at least those are the words he wrote for reporter Yvette (Davina Joy, who remarkably still had a career after this film). The creepy Mary Young tags along as a representative of the church.

The official story of the house is that someone killed the family, then mom coming home finding them dead, commits suicide in grief as per her note. We know that mom is the killer from the opening grainy film...but the ""why"" provides the twist.

For those who like the ""Paranormal Activity"" series or someone who likes to see a skeptic put in their place, this film fits your needs. The acting left much to be desired. Patti Tindall read her lines horribly. The frequent close ups of her face didn't add anything to the film, but may be a clue as to the director's love interest. The music composed by Mike Marsh for the film was trite and cliche horror stuff, that should not have been used, leading me to believe the director swings both ways.

The film had a good slow build up which held my interest, but at times the green night time camera became too much. Decent for a low budget production. I was not overly fond of the ""Paranormal"" series and would place it on par with them.

Some real character development would have made it a better film, as would tighter editing. All that said, even at its worst, it's not as embarrassingly bad as Ghost Hunters (""whoa, dude - did you hear that?""). Once they catch the first images on video, I got sucked in. I liked the bit where Davina Joy and Marsh have fun with references to other horror films, including Blair Witch.

3174760,5,B0017PB5W4,"Creepy as hell.  Those are the ""three little words"" that every horror film aspires to achieve.  Very few succeed - especially in this horror fanatic's opinion - but Death of a Ghost Hunter earns this proclamation from my lips (and fingers).  It isn't a perfect film by any means, and some of my fellow horror enthusiasts have criticized it rather heavily, but this is the creepiest film I've seen since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rec/dp/B0028DRGDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">[Rec</a>].  Not surprisingly, Death of a Ghost Hunter is a low-budget labor of love - I shudder to think just how badly Hollywood would have ruined it.  I actually see some of the movie's weaknesses, as pointed out by others, as strengths.  For instance, critics love to point out that the film was shot in a mere nine days, as if the secret of cinematic success is to spend a hundred million dollars over the course of nine months while pampering ""stars"" who might deign to come out of their trailers once or twice a day to actually shoot something.  Death of a Ghost Hunter is all about atmosphere, and I have to believe that such a tight shooting schedule helped cast and crew remain focused at all times on the task at hand and helped maintain that all-important atmosphere throughout.  This is a tight film - in terms of the production as well as the story itself - and I see that as a good thing.  Sure, the acting isn't top-notch in every scene, some of the dialogue could have benefited from some retooling, and the last part of the film is justifiably open for debate, but this film registers abnormally high on my creepiness meter, and a horror fan can hardly ask for more than that.

The story is presented as a documentary account/recreation of ghost hunter Carter Simms' investigation of the Masterson house in Arizona - an investigation which, as we are told from the outset, resulted in Simms' death.  The house itself has been preserved almost untouched for the past twenty years, ever since the Masterson family (a minister, his wife, and their two children) were brutally murdered within its walls.  The house's current owner offers Simms five grand to investigate the goings-on there, and she is only too happy to oblige - even though it means working alongside a videographer and a newspaper reporter.  While Simms prefers to work alone, her new little trio works together fairly well.  The fourth member of this rag-tag team is a problem, though.  Mary Young Mortensen, a member of the church Mr. Masterson founded, is there to make sure the good name of the Mortensen family isn't besmirched.  It's a very fundamentalist church, and Mary herself is the worst kind of Christian - exceedingly judgmental and all too quick to condemn others.  Some Christian viewers may be offended by such a stereotypical portrayal of this Bible-thumper extraordinaire.  As a fundamentalist myself, I know she is in no way representative of my beliefs and practices, though, so it really doesn't bother me personally.  As far as the ghost hunting itself goes, truly dramatic things are observed and experienced the very first night, setting the stage for one intensive and eye-opening investigation that plays out in a way that Carter Simms could never have foreseen.

Despite all of the bad reviews this film has gotten, I personally consider it one of the best haunting-based movies I've ever seen.  I say this as a pretty seasoned horror veteran who has been watching every horror film I can get my hands on for over a quarter of a century.  Yes, I will acknowledge the fact that this film has some flaws (particularly in the acting department), most of which are a direct result of the movie's low budget.  Given the resources at hand (according to my research, the film was made with a paltry budget of just ten thousand dollars), though, Death of a Ghost Hunter succeeds triumphantly.  The cinematography is amazing and the low-CGI special effects work exceedingly well.  The rapid-flash blending of past and present is presented much more effectively than what you will find in most large-budget horror films, and the ghostly manifestations presented throughout the course of the film include some of the creepiest shots I've ever seen.  That all speaks to one heck of a good directing job.  The early and late exposition scenes may run a tad long for some viewers, but everything in between is tightly shot by a director who really knows how to build tension, suspense, and atmosphere.  If this movie is any indication, it's just a matter of time before Sean Tretta is a household name among horror fans.  I know there are a lot of bad reviews of this film out there, but I would just ask you to give this film a chance.  It's one of the best low-budget horror films I've ever seen.",1289260800,10,4816,4.873619631901841
3174761,5,B0017PB5W4,"It is hard to find good horror movies, so I was very pleased to run across this one. The story is of a team of Ghost Hunters who take a job with one very haunted house. The movie is done on a tight budget but they make it work for them. The story works on two levels of horror which is nice and adds to the realistic feel of the film. There are one or two of the actors that are not very convincing but overall it still works.

3174762,2,B0017PB5W4,"OK I did like the Movie. But! This is the important part
The acting is really bad, I mean really, really bad. Very transparent and amateur in delivery and dialogue.
The sound man should be fined for his lack of professionalism.
Seriously huge swings from the lowest level when it is required to follow the plot line, to ""LOUD sound effects in a possible attempt to instill fear?"" Sound does have an impact on people and you. Making the movie be something you can follow is kind of important the audio completely ruined this.
Can a movie be scary with amateur lame acting?
Yes. The folks who made the movie got the hard part right! The story even though it is 100% Fabricated and has some glaring errors, it is truly compelling and scary. If I made the movie I would remaster the audio and edit out some of the 1st grader level acting. This has great potential and is compelling, but it is far from great. Just OK, but worth a look if you are into the ghost thing or into getting thrills from scary flicks. It even has a comedy result if you want to mock the crappy acting the weak dialogue and the audio issues which may be some of the worst I have ever experienced in any movie I have ever encountered. The sound guy needs to be banned from ever working in the entertainment field again.",1284854400,2,1288,4.348547717842323
3174763,3,B0017PB5W4,"The opening montage of GHOST HUNTER seemed like a dreadful repetition of PARANORMAL ENTITY: Handheld camera, scratchy film with forensic appearing pretensions, less than professional actors, very low budget, etc. Then after a couple minutes (this was even before the opening credits) the action in the montage took on a more horrific hue: Woman drowns baby with cross in a bathtub, then blows her brains out. I have a particular aversion to violence directed at children & animals, and remember thinking: This better be damn good...

Then about 20 minutes into the actual story, I thought that what was unfolding was pretty interesting. Then I got sucked right into the plot & remained there until the bloody end, with even more horrific content than the first.

The only thing that really bothered me was the unevenness of the sound. This seemed to amend itself after the first half of the move, still it's a close to fatal flaw.

The acting was better than expected, but what really impressed me was the directing & script. True, the script is reminiscent of THE HAUNT, POLTERGEIST, etc, but it had originality all its own. For example, the spectral effects were well conceived. Nothing too over the top, many scenes were subtle & made the scary effect all that more affective. The full Monte effects of the ghosts were really good; sort of cubist conception with blending layers with a multidimensional dimensional appearance. 5 Stars for the ghosts!

GHOST HUNTER indicates real talent & I hope the project has encouraged all involved to further creativity.

This is all I want to say because I don't want to spoil the story. Recommended for rental & archival/horror archival purchase.

3174766,3,B0017PB5W4,"When I rented this, I had pretty low expectations. Then after the first 10 minutes or so, I lowered them still. The up sides to this movie: good plot line with unexpected ending and some good creepy moments. The downsides: the acting is just awful. The lead that narrates at times is obviously reading as she speaks so it loses its sincerity. Though her performance did pick up as the movie went on. The supporting characters need some help. The woman playing the journalist couldn't be worse. During her ""dramatic"" moments, I could see her reciting them in front of the bathroom mirror and had no spontaneity and were completely disingenuous and thoroughly contrived. I suspect I won't be seeing her nominated for an oscar any time in the near future.

In the end, I was rather surprised that I liked it as well as I did. It lacks a lot of special effects, but personally I think it adds to realism of a ghost story. One other complaint, and this is minor and easy enough to overcome, was the sets. It is supposed to take place in a house that hasn't been touched since about 1984 furnishings and all. No one but a cleaning lady has been inside in 25 years. But the structure, design and decor are all clearly much more modern than that making it difficult at times to get into for me since I tend to notice those kinds of little details. Obviously it was a budgetary problem, but there are enough houses out there lacking in updates that I think the director/producer could have done better.",1275091200,,1493,4.509225092250922
3174767,2,B0017PB5W4,"It is understood that this is a low-budget movie, but surprisingly the filmography doesn't seem to make that apparent.  It's when you get begin to meet the actors and get deeper into the plot that you soon discover why this movie isn't even close to ""Paranormal Activity"" when it comes to low-budget palpable suspense and anticipation.  The audio and soundtrack failed to carry any level of heightened suspense.  Perhaps this would have greatly benefited from having been viewed in ""first-person"" camera mode (like ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield"").

Starting with the characters, they were hardly believable, and it was very apparent the actors were not true to the characters that I'm sure the writers had envisioned.  The most true character, surprisingly, was Yvette Sandavol, played by Davina Joy.  Yvette, a writer for the local paper, was by far the most believable character.  Carter Simms, played by Patti Tindall, never seemed to live up to the essence of her character.  She was initially portrayed as a headstrong woman on a mission,  determined to accomplish what she'd been tasked with by the home's owner.  She was easily thrown off her game by a whacked-out Christian fundamentalist named Mary Young Mortenson (played by Lindsay Page), who overplayed the part and was almost unwatchable.  One scene showed the two in a contrived melee in which Mary Young ended up pinned on the floor by Carter Simms.  Mike Marsh played the part of Colin Green, a video producer and friend of the home's owner.  It's clear that Mike should stick to writing, and leave the acting to other aspiring actors looking to work their way up from the low-budget realm.

The special effects (yes, there are some) fail to create the feeling of suspense and anticipation of other low-budget horror flicks.  The scene transitions hardly curdle one's blood; they were very flat and ho-hum.  The scenes including the ghosts from the children murdered in the home almost make you sick and thankful that none of the events in this story actually took place.  There were a few parts that did leave me wondering what would happen next, but each time the anticipation was dampened by another flat and overdone ghost scene.  In watching this movie, I really wanted it to play out and create a sense of true fear inside of me, but each time I was left with that feeling of ""that's it?"".

PLOT SPOILER:
The events in the house on which the ghost story took place were patently ridiculous and hardly believable.  A disturbed Christian family man brings home another woman, chains her up in his garage, and impregnates her.  The woman delivers the baby, and somehow this drives his wife to murder the entire family, including the woman as she's clutching her newborn baby.  The scenes depicting the murder of the children (which are taboo in even the most graphic of horror flicks) are very disturbing, and once again I would remind myself that none of this was based on any actual events.  The newborn is then placed in a bathtub of running water, with the intent to drown it.  The wife proceeds to commit suicide by placing a revolver inside of her mouth. A crucifix that she placed with the baby inside of the bathtub had managed to wedge the drain plug open, thus saving the baby from drowning.  The baby was later discovered by a police officer and was eventually adopted by that same man.  The baby turned out to be Mary Young Mortenson, who became deranged and destined to carry out the same murders including her very own demise in the same way the original murders were committed 20 years earlier.

This wasn't the worst horror flick I'd ever seen, but it did disappoint me.  Even with the ""B-movie"" type classification, I had high hopes.  I should have watched this BEFORE ""Paranormal Activity"", and perhaps my standards would have been more reasonable.  It reminded me of the time as a kid when I saw ""Amityville 3D""- a horrifying train-wreck of a horror-movie- where I went in expecting so much but left the theater feeling let down.

First off, this is not based on a true story what so ever, that is just the excuse for a low budget, bad acting film that is a mess. It starts off like it's going to be a documentary, or a re-cap of what was found in the woman's investigation journal.

Then it goes into really bad acting, some seen it before effects, and takes pages from movies like Blair Witch, Last Broadcast and such movies. I was starting to overlook the acting and confusing plot, but by the end of this film it was just getting so stupid I had to turn it off... mainly cause of the fact that from the beginning of the film I knew that the captions trying to tell you this really happened, or was based on a true event, was complete B.S. and it's ending was an attempt to try and write something clever and interesting but falls flat.

But above all that, what I hated the most of this film was having a headache trying to follow it because of the terrible audio.

That is what is so unsettling about this film, the fact that this evil lives on your street, in your town, and you cannot escape it.

3409216,1,B0017PB5W4,"This story begins promisingly with a young parapsychologist leaving her home in Salem, Oregon and driving to Arizona to investigate a supposedly haunted house.  She gets the scoop from a relative who briefly relates the story of the slain Mastersons. We already know about the killings because of an attention-grabbing opening sequence. The lady doc and three accomplices settle in for the spooky doings.  The other three ghost hunters are a TV cameraman with a bunch of equipment that seems to break down in key places, an ethnic newspaper woman from the town, and an apparently eccentric young woman who is having problems with her periods.
With the introduction of the young woman, problems begin with the storyline.  She is supposedly an ardent Christian because she carries her Bible around and keeps saying that the Mastersons were good people and the ghost hunters are wretched vile heathens trying to tear their image apart.
As the apparitions become more noticeable and the living characters become more irritable from lack of sleep, we learn through visions and accidental discoveries that the Masterson family was truly disturbed.  In a lengthy explanatory passage at the end, the ""whole story"" is brought out.  Whether you accept it or not depends on your reaction to the movie to this point.
This movie plays as a combination of Blair Witch, The Exorcist, and Casper the Friendly Ghost.  I did not get the creepy disembodied feeling that these other-worldly apparitions were truly harmful, although one of them has a problem with anger management.  We know pretty much what happened because of the opening sequence.  This leaves us focusing on the people in the present, and they are not a promising lot.
The young woman parapsychologist follows the time honored pattern of the spiritual guru who has all the answers.  She sometimes sounds like the diminutive exorcist in Spielberg's ""Poltergeist.""  The TV cameraman smokes a lot and often says, ""You better come down and see this,"" and ""My battery just went dead."" He is the only male in an otherwise entirely female drama. He is much more interesting when he is looking through his camera than when the camera is on him. The ethnic news reporter is there for her filthy language and arguments with the young Christian zealot. The real problem, however, is this crazy young woman who is supposed to represent the church that the Mastersons attended.  She is vacuous, irritating and purposeless, but as the movie progresses, she steals center-stage from the ghost hunters.  Trouble is, there really isn't anything ""in"" this character except her lunatic-fringe Christian diatribes.
It may be true in this politically correct world that ethnic minorities and the mentally and physically challenged are not proper objects of ridicule.  This seems to leave Christians as fair game.  In an adaptation of one of Stephen King's novels (The Fog), the chief antagonist is another Bible-spouting fanatic.  As we learn in the Masterson saga, the lord of the manor is a hypocritical sex-fiend, and his wife is a repressed, neurotic psycho who makes love with her head in a box.  However, these revelations, which should carry some conviction and drama, seem to be thrown in just to make the movie more lurid.  Yeah, yeah:  Christians are all a bunch of hypocrites.  (And they tend to agree and say, ""There's always room for one more!) So what?  Is this the purpose of the movie:  Christian bashing?  It's the old wacko, hypocritical, Bible-thumping, fire-and-brimstone caricature that's been around since the Pilgrims landed.
Therefore, I believe that the central aspect of the movie, the damn-the-hypocritical Christians, is lame,easy, soft, cheesy, unconvincing, you name it.  It's always easier to stereotype people rather than create real, three-dimensional characters.  The movie takes an easy way out.
We become involved with characters when we understand them and identify with them.  Caricatures are just that:  two dimensional targets which pander to people's prejudices.
This house is supposedly one of the ten most haunted houses in America.  This movie is haunted by bad acting, poor character development, stereotyping and aimlessness.  The so-called explanation doesn't really explain anything.  And why isn't this key character wandering around the house?  She should feel right at home with the other crazy, two-dimensional fanatics.",1215734400,8,4400,5.2

the plot

In Queen Creek, Arizona, the family of Minister Joseph Masterson was murdered inside their home on the night of October 10th, 1982. The murder was carried out by Mary Beth, the wife of Joseph Masterson. Police investigations officially state the murders are unsolved, due mainly to the suicide note left by Mary Beth claiming this to be true.

Almost twenty years later to the day, nephew of Minister Joseph, Seth Masterson decided to hire a paranormal expert to investigate whether this house was haunted. There have been reports from the maid who dusts once a month at the Masterson house, as well as a gardener of ghost sitings. He offered Carter Simms $5000 to investigate the house and report her findings either way. Unbeknownst to Carter, she was to be accompanied by a videographer named Colin Green, a journalist name Yvette Sandoval and an overseer from the church where Minister Joseph used to work, her name is Mary Young Mortenson. Her position here was to make sure that the good name of the church or the good Masterson name were not speciously misrepresented by the heathen ghost hunter.

Carter Simms arrived in Arizona and went into the home on October 17th, 2002. She used her paranormal electronic measuring devices as well as Colins handheld and stationary cameras in order to find proof of any paranormal activity. Even on the first night, they found some evidence to support a haunting. In one room, the temperature was unexplainably 20 degrees cooler and there were chairs moving by themselves. The next day they reviewed their audio and video recordings which led to further evidence of ghosts occupying this residence.

Somehow, they still needed proof to gather. This turned into a murder investigation of Mary Beth Masterson as the ghastly pieces of evidence kept piling on. Very creepy happenings were experienced by all three of the professional guests, and there seemed to be something almost as creepy about the church girl Mary Young. We know what happens to Carter Simms from the movie title, but how and why will Carter Simms lose her life in this haunted house? Find out when you watch Death of a Ghost Hunter.

the breakdown

Going into this film, I imagined it to be almost a waste of time. A low-budgeted indie that will fall short to impress and worse than this, fail to scare me. About ten minutes into the movie, I was smug with confirmation. The brainless incidental music contrasted with Patti Tindalls (the actress who plays the lead  Carter Simms) voice over narration had the smack of amateur as far as the audio was concerned as well as the presentation. Yet, as the cast fully assembled into the haunted house, it began coming together. Sure, there was still the sound of stupid music (provided by the writer Mike Marsh) that constantly played in the background, but even this started making sense as the film progressed. The music is a blatant rip-off of the slightly more effective soundtrack of 1978s Halloween, which the music was coincidentally penned by film writer John Carpenter.

As far as ripping off other films, its pretty blatant as far as having connections to movies like Amityville Horror, and it even goes so far as deliberately quoting Poltergeist, The Exorcist and Blair Witch Project. The independent, low-budget aspect of the film certainly recalls Blair Witch, but they still managed to offer up some effective special effects. The ghostly beings may raise the hair on your arms in the same way it had done to mine. Despite the title there was also a bit of unpredictability, and the film also exudes an aura of danger within the house and the history of the murders.

This being said, there was some trouble with the writing. Not with the story mostly, but with the mundane conversations between the four characters. The very liberal-minded writers Mike Marsh and Sean Tretta made every Christian character in the film a villain. Mary Young is the typical Hollywood-invented, closed-minded Christian individual with tendencies toward overt bigotry toward anyone who isn't Christian or Caucasian. She even comments about the neighborhood going downhill as there were more blacks moving into the area. Please, Louise! I expect a little more open-mindedness from my independent films, I mean come on, this isn't a Stephen King flick for goodness sakes! Then again, the mindset of the country at the time of release in 2007 was very anti-Bush who in some ways epitomizes these characteristics. Had this been a bit different if it were released today when the country is waking up to what progressivism really is, remains to be seen.

For a low budget movie, Im guessing that most of the monies went into a couple of nude scenes from at least three actresses. Lindsay Page, April Hinojosa, and Sarah Lawton each practically bared all for the film. This film was not rated, I guess because it went straight to video, and aside from the nudity there is plenty of profanity throughout the movie. Saving some money may have went into casting music director/script writer Mike Marsh in the role of videographer Colin Green. Mike Marsh had some really funny one-liners much in the way Hud had in Cloverfield (who was also videographer by the way) which was released about a year later.

The ending was what sealed the deal for me. Not only was I scared, but now the film actually gave me chills. An imaginative twist was placed at the end which surprised me at least, and effected me in a truly creepy way. So despite the spotty acting, the usual characterization assassinations, and the shoddy music, this film does what it promises, it scares you  the viewer. Take a chance and check this out, my guess is that you're probably going to like it  if you're a horror movie fan that is.

If they had a larger budget I imagine this movie would be very well received, and even cutting out a few scenes could get rid of the really hideous acting.

Bottom line is if you're a fan of the genre and the style then give it a go and focus on the narrative, just let it tell you the story without any expectations and you should enjoy it. One other thing of note, the sound isn't well equalized, some parts the volume is too low to hear anything so you turn it up, only to find that a few seconds later there's a loud part that gets way too loud. Just keep the remote handy to adjust the volume when needed.

3409234,2,B0017PB5W4,"Death of a Ghost Hunter (Sean Tretta, 2007)

I really wanted to like Death of a Ghost Hunter, the first feature from Sean Tretta; the next year, he released The Death Factory Bloodletting, a slasher flick that never takes itself too seriously and ends up being a stupidly good time because of it. This movie, however, does not have that same attribute, while richly needing it; while it does have a few good-but-predictable twists, Tretta was still finding his cinematic feet here, and the end result is somewhat less than it should have been.

Death of a Ghost Hunter is the story of Carter Simms (Machined's Patti Tindall), a paranormal investigator who's been hired to check out a house notorious for the mass murder of the family who lived there twenty years ago. When she and her cameraman Colin (Mike Marsh, who returned for The Death Factory Bloodletting) arrive, they discover an unpleasant surprise waiting for them in the form of Yvette (The Devil's Playhouse's Davina Joy), an investigative reporter who's as interested to get the full story on Carter Simms as she is to find out whether the house is haunted. As if that's not enough, a spiritual advisor, Mary (Lindsay Page in her only screen appearance to date), shows up later the first night to do some Bible-thumping. It's a motley crew indeed, almost as if the homeowner hand-picked these folks to play off one another. (You saw this more recently in Episode 50.) When creepy things start happening, the crew try to get to the bottom of what actually happened in the house and whether there are ghosts haunting it.

There are some very interesting pieces to this plot (warning: the backstory of the house ends up containing a lot of triggering stuff), and Tretta, in his first collaboration with screenwriter Mike Marsh, had some good ideas about where to go. Both of those upsides were hamstrung by the obviously low budget they were working with and the caliber of some of the acting (there's a reason, one assumes, Page has only ever appeared in one movie). Given that Tretta has since shown himself capable of better when he's got even a slightly larger budget, it might be an interesting exercise for, say, Megan Ellison to toss fifty grand at him and see what a remake of this would look like with some professional actors (and a few better effects). What's here is heavy on potential, light on execution. **",1400457600,2,2381,4.760290556900727

So, that part of the script is dumb. Why the writer couldn't just have had a whole team investigate is beyond me. It would, for me, have made the whole thing more believable.

The acting is bad. Probably the best actor is the video guy. The lead actress is so bad, it makes the whole film suffer. I understand this is a ""mockumentary,"" but still, using some better actors wouldn't have hurt. Again, this movie would have benefited by having as part of the premise, a paranormal investigative team. The worst actress is the ""writer,"" and what is she doing there, anyway? The screenwriter could have at least made her an assistant to the video guy, or something.

I could go on, but I'm pretty much just echoing what others have said.

Next, the sound was just horrible.  I could barely hear the dialogue, but when music played or when the characters were outside the sound level jumped up annoyingly.

The story is extremely predicable and one of the characters did not fool me at all as to who she was.

One reviewer believes that nobody else has ever thought of this concept. Well, either that is not true, or else it is but it was executed so poorly that the predictability factor ruined the entire story.

Her tools are a digital thermometer, EMF detector (great at detecting nuclear blasts), sound recorder, and irritating first person narration filled with creative 101 phrases such as ""ominous foreboding"" and ""retain the darkness."" Colin (Mike Marsh- writer, producer, and composer of said film) is the bald camera man who gives himself a ""7"" out of ""10"" or at least those are the words he wrote for reporter Yvette (Davina Joy, who remarkably still had a career after this film). The creepy Mary Young tags along as a representative of the church.

The official story of the house is that someone killed the family, then mom coming home finding them dead, commits suicide in grief as per her note. We know that mom is the killer from the opening grainy film...but the ""why"" provides the twist.

For those who like the ""Paranormal Activity"" series or someone who likes to see a skeptic put in their place, this film fits your needs. The acting left much to be desired. Patti Tindall read her lines horribly. The frequent close ups of her face didn't add anything to the film, but may be a clue as to the director's love interest. The music composed by Mike Marsh for the film was trite and cliche horror stuff, that should not have been used, leading me to believe the director swings both ways.

The film had a good slow build up which held my interest, but at times the green night time camera became too much. Decent for a low budget production. I was not overly fond of the ""Paranormal"" series and would place it on par with them.

I liked the bit where Davina Joy and Marsh have fun with references to other horror films, including Blair Witch.

3409257,5,B0017PB5W4,"Creepy as hell.  Those are the ""three little words"" that every horror film aspires to achieve.  Very few succeed - especially in this horror fanatic's opinion - but Death of a Ghost Hunter earns this proclamation from my lips (and fingers).  It isn't a perfect film by any means, and some of my fellow horror enthusiasts have criticized it rather heavily, but this is the creepiest film I've seen since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rec/dp/B0028DRGDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">[Rec</a>].  Not surprisingly, Death of a Ghost Hunter is a low-budget labor of love - I shudder to think just how badly Hollywood would have ruined it.  I actually see some of the movie's weaknesses, as pointed out by others, as strengths.  For instance, critics love to point out that the film was shot in a mere nine days, as if the secret of cinematic success is to spend a hundred million dollars over the course of nine months while pampering ""stars"" who might deign to come out of their trailers once or twice a day to actually shoot something.  Death of a Ghost Hunter is all about atmosphere, and I have to believe that such a tight shooting schedule helped cast and crew remain focused at all times on the task at hand and helped maintain that all-important atmosphere throughout.  This is a tight film - in terms of the production as well as the story itself - and I see that as a good thing.  Sure, the acting isn't top-notch in every scene, some of the dialogue could have benefited from some retooling, and the last part of the film is justifiably open for debate, but this film registers abnormally high on my creepiness meter, and a horror fan can hardly ask for more than that.

The story is presented as a documentary account/recreation of ghost hunter Carter Simms' investigation of the Masterson house in Arizona - an investigation which, as we are told from the outset, resulted in Simms' death.  The house itself has been preserved almost untouched for the past twenty years, ever since the Masterson family (a minister, his wife, and their two children) were brutally murdered within its walls.  The house's current owner offers Simms five grand to investigate the goings-on there, and she is only too happy to oblige - even though it means working alongside a videographer and a newspaper reporter.  While Simms prefers to work alone, her new little trio works together fairly well.  The fourth member of this rag-tag team is a problem, though.  Mary Young Mortensen, a member of the church Mr. Masterson founded, is there to make sure the good name of the Mortensen family isn't besmirched.  It's a very fundamentalist church, and Mary herself is the worst kind of Christian - exceedingly judgmental and all too quick to condemn others.  Some Christian viewers may be offended by such a stereotypical portrayal of this Bible-thumper extraordinaire.  As a fundamentalist myself, I know she is in no way representative of my beliefs and practices, though, so it really doesn't bother me personally.  As far as the ghost hunting itself goes, truly dramatic things are observed and experienced the very first night, setting the stage for one intensive and eye-opening investigation that plays out in a way that Carter Simms could never have foreseen.

Despite all of the bad reviews this film has gotten, I personally consider it one of the best haunting-based movies I've ever seen.  I say this as a pretty seasoned horror veteran who has been watching every horror film I can get my hands on for over a quarter of a century.  Yes, I will acknowledge the fact that this film has some flaws (particularly in the acting department), most of which are a direct result of the movie's low budget.  Given the resources at hand (according to my research, the film was made with a paltry budget of just ten thousand dollars), though, Death of a Ghost Hunter succeeds triumphantly.  The cinematography is amazing and the low-CGI special effects work exceedingly well.  The rapid-flash blending of past and present is presented much more effectively than what you will find in most large-budget horror films, and the ghostly manifestations presented throughout the course of the film include some of the creepiest shots I've ever seen.  That all speaks to one heck of a good directing job.  The early and late exposition scenes may run a tad long for some viewers, but everything in between is tightly shot by a director who really knows how to build tension, suspense, and atmosphere.  If this movie is any indication, it's just a matter of time before Sean Tretta is a household name among horror fans.  I know there are a lot of bad reviews of this film out there, but I would just ask you to give this film a chance.  It's one of the best low-budget horror films I've ever seen.",1289260800,10,4816,4.873619631901841
3409258,5,B0017PB5W4,"It is hard to find good horror movies, so I was very pleased to run across this one. The story is of a team of Ghost Hunters who take a job with one very haunted house. The movie is done on a tight budget but they make it work for them. The story works on two levels of horror which is nice and adds to the realistic feel of the film. There are one or two of the actors that are not very convincing but overall it still works.

3409259,2,B0017PB5W4,"OK I did like the Movie. But! This is the important part
The acting is really bad, I mean really, really bad. Very transparent and amateur in delivery and dialogue.
The sound man should be fined for his lack of professionalism.
Seriously huge swings from the lowest level when it is required to follow the plot line, to ""LOUD sound effects in a possible attempt to instill fear?"" Sound does have an impact on people and you. Making the movie be something you can follow is kind of important the audio completely ruined this.
Can a movie be scary with amateur lame acting?
Yes. The folks who made the movie got the hard part right! The story even though it is 100% Fabricated and has some glaring errors, it is truly compelling and scary. If I made the movie I would remaster the audio and edit out some of the 1st grader level acting. This has great potential and is compelling, but it is far from great. Just OK, but worth a look if you are into the ghost thing or into getting thrills from scary flicks. It even has a comedy result if you want to mock the crappy acting the weak dialogue and the audio issues which may be some of the worst I have ever experienced in any movie I have ever encountered. The sound guy needs to be banned from ever working in the entertainment field again.",1284854400,2,1288,4.348547717842323
3409260,3,B0017PB5W4,"The opening montage of GHOST HUNTER seemed like a dreadful repetition of PARANORMAL ENTITY: Handheld camera, scratchy film with forensic appearing pretensions, less than professional actors, very low budget, etc. Then after a couple minutes (this was even before the opening credits) the action in the montage took on a more horrific hue: Woman drowns baby with cross in a bathtub, then blows her brains out. I have a particular aversion to violence directed at children & animals, and remember thinking: This better be damn good...

Then about 20 minutes into the actual story, I thought that what was unfolding was pretty interesting. Then I got sucked right into the plot & remained there until the bloody end, with even more horrific content than the first.

The only thing that really bothered me was the unevenness of the sound. This seemed to amend itself after the first half of the move, still it's a close to fatal flaw.

The acting was better than expected, but what really impressed me was the directing & script. True, the script is reminiscent of THE HAUNT, POLTERGEIST, etc, but it had originality all its own. For example, the spectral effects were well conceived. Nothing too over the top, many scenes were subtle & made the scary effect all that more affective. The full Monte effects of the ghosts were really good; sort of cubist conception with blending layers with a multidimensional dimensional appearance. 5 Stars for the ghosts!

GHOST HUNTER indicates real talent & I hope the project has encouraged all involved to further creativity.

This is all I want to say because I don't want to spoil the story. Recommended for rental & archival/horror archival purchase.

3409263,3,B0017PB5W4,"When I rented this, I had pretty low expectations. Then after the first 10 minutes or so, I lowered them still. The up sides to this movie: good plot line with unexpected ending and some good creepy moments. The downsides: the acting is just awful. The lead that narrates at times is obviously reading as she speaks so it loses its sincerity. Though her performance did pick up as the movie went on. The supporting characters need some help. The woman playing the journalist couldn't be worse. During her ""dramatic"" moments, I could see her reciting them in front of the bathroom mirror and had no spontaneity and were completely disingenuous and thoroughly contrived. I suspect I won't be seeing her nominated for an oscar any time in the near future.

In the end, I was rather surprised that I liked it as well as I did. It lacks a lot of special effects, but personally I think it adds to realism of a ghost story. One other complaint, and this is minor and easy enough to overcome, was the sets. It is supposed to take place in a house that hasn't been touched since about 1984 furnishings and all. No one but a cleaning lady has been inside in 25 years. But the structure, design and decor are all clearly much more modern than that making it difficult at times to get into for me since I tend to notice those kinds of little details. Obviously it was a budgetary problem, but there are enough houses out there lacking in updates that I think the director/producer could have done better.",1275091200,,1493,4.509225092250922
3409264,2,B0017PB5W4,"It is understood that this is a low-budget movie, but surprisingly the filmography doesn't seem to make that apparent.  It's when you get begin to meet the actors and get deeper into the plot that you soon discover why this movie isn't even close to ""Paranormal Activity"" when it comes to low-budget palpable suspense and anticipation.  The audio and soundtrack failed to carry any level of heightened suspense.  Perhaps this would have greatly benefited from having been viewed in ""first-person"" camera mode (like ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield"").

Starting with the characters, they were hardly believable, and it was very apparent the actors were not true to the characters that I'm sure the writers had envisioned.  The most true character, surprisingly, was Yvette Sandavol, played by Davina Joy.  Yvette, a writer for the local paper, was by far the most believable character.  Carter Simms, played by Patti Tindall, never seemed to live up to the essence of her character.  She was initially portrayed as a headstrong woman on a mission,  determined to accomplish what she'd been tasked with by the home's owner.  She was easily thrown off her game by a whacked-out Christian fundamentalist named Mary Young Mortenson (played by Lindsay Page), who overplayed the part and was almost unwatchable.  One scene showed the two in a contrived melee in which Mary Young ended up pinned on the floor by Carter Simms.  Mike Marsh played the part of Colin Green, a video producer and friend of the home's owner.  It's clear that Mike should stick to writing, and leave the acting to other aspiring actors looking to work their way up from the low-budget realm.

The special effects (yes, there are some) fail to create the feeling of suspense and anticipation of other low-budget horror flicks.  The scene transitions hardly curdle one's blood; they were very flat and ho-hum.  The scenes including the ghosts from the children murdered in the home almost make you sick and thankful that none of the events in this story actually took place.  There were a few parts that did leave me wondering what would happen next, but each time the anticipation was dampened by another flat and overdone ghost scene.  In watching this movie, I really wanted it to play out and create a sense of true fear inside of me, but each time I was left with that feeling of ""that's it?"".

PLOT SPOILER:
The events in the house on which the ghost story took place were patently ridiculous and hardly believable.  A disturbed Christian family man brings home another woman, chains her up in his garage, and impregnates her.  The woman delivers the baby, and somehow this drives his wife to murder the entire family, including the woman as she's clutching her newborn baby.  The scenes depicting the murder of the children (which are taboo in even the most graphic of horror flicks) are very disturbing, and once again I would remind myself that none of this was based on any actual events.  The newborn is then placed in a bathtub of running water, with the intent to drown it.  The wife proceeds to commit suicide by placing a revolver inside of her mouth. A crucifix that she placed with the baby inside of the bathtub had managed to wedge the drain plug open, thus saving the baby from drowning.  The baby was later discovered by a police officer and was eventually adopted by that same man.  The baby turned out to be Mary Young Mortenson, who became deranged and destined to carry out the same murders including her very own demise in the same way the original murders were committed 20 years earlier.

This wasn't the worst horror flick I'd ever seen, but it did disappoint me.  Even with the ""B-movie"" type classification, I had high hopes.  I should have watched this BEFORE ""Paranormal Activity"", and perhaps my standards would have been more reasonable.  It reminded me of the time as a kid when I saw ""Amityville 3D""- a horrifying train-wreck of a horror-movie- where I went in expecting so much but left the theater feeling let down.

First off, this is not based on a true story what so ever, that is just the excuse for a low budget, bad acting film that is a mess. It starts off like it's going to be a documentary, or a re-cap of what was found in the woman's investigation journal.

Then it goes into really bad acting, some seen it before effects, and takes pages from movies like Blair Witch, Last Broadcast and such movies. I was starting to overlook the acting and confusing plot, but by the end of this film it was just getting so stupid I had to turn it off... mainly cause of the fact that from the beginning of the film I knew that the captions trying to tell you this really happened, or was based on a true event, was complete B.S. and it's ending was an attempt to try and write something clever and interesting but falls flat.

But above all that, what I hated the most of this film was having a headache trying to follow it because of the terrible audio.

Except for the ""Christian"", who is portrayed in the usual stereotypical way, and is not likable (have you noticed that only Christians--and white males, for that matter-- are the only groups which it is still politically correct to dump on unreservedly?)  Anyway, like I said, the film starts out bearably enough, because the approach is more clinical than is usually seen in this type film.  They set up shop in a house (nice, plain suburban home--no spooky points for setting) where a family was murdered some years before.  Through several nights they document various ghostly, supernatural occurrences, which ultimately reveal what actually happened in the house all those years ago.

And here the film degenerates into really bottom-of-the-barrel mode.  A few more actors are introduced (in flashbacks revealing what happened all those years ago), and they are pitifully bad.  The story is one you guessed from the very beginning (but hoped maybe they'd come up with something different, and thus surprise you, but didn't).  So the story ended up holding no surprises, and you've just sat through some abysmal acting and lame, well-worn scenarios for nothing.  Don't make the mistake I did, by watching the whole thing.

Hardly any gore, no real sex (just a suggestion once), minimal bad language, actually some brief nudity (boob shots).  All of which is fine by me, but just letting you know.",1525046400,,1825,5.101010101010101

8266785,1,B0017PB5W4,"This is an odd little film, further oddened by the fact that apparently it wasn't properly transferred to Amazon Prime in terms of aspect ratio, because it's supposed to be in widescreen, but for some reason comes out in full screen, with the black bars on top and bottom, so it's only taking up like 2/3rds of the screen.

At first I thought it was supposed to be in full screen, as it begins with an inexplicable murder sequence set in 1982 yet supposedly filmed on some kind of 1950s or 60s style reel camera. As the camera repeatedly cuts to multiple shots, including some impossible ones like several feet behind a solid wall, it's increasingly unclear what the point of this footage is or what it's supposed to be in-universe. No mention of this footage is made ever again and it's completely unnecessary. They could have used it the way they do later on, splicing fragments and clips in like ""visions"".

Once it gets to the real film itself, it turns to a more conventional camera, though with a rather odd framerate that, mixed with its introductory style, makes it look and feel like a Forensic Files-style re-enactment documentary. They go with this style for about 20 minutes before dropping it and going for a purely conventional style movie... but continuing in the odd framerate/shooting style of a true crime re-enactment, complete with a solitary piece of repetitive music that is used and re-used in every spooky scene that sounds like it was pecked out on a casio keyboard.

the film itself covers a paranormal investigator named Carter who is investigating a house owned by an inexplicably successful 28-year old who inherited it from his father, who in turn inherited it from his brother who was murdered with his children by his wife, who then apparently drowns a baby. This is the murder we see at the beginning of the film.

Inexplicably, the guy wants her to work with two other people; a cameraguy friend of his, and a writer. Once they all meet and come to the house, they're met up with a woman, Mary Young Mortenson, for whom I give credit to the actor for not portraying in the stereotypical uptight Christian conservative zealot but making her somewhat believable, willing to curse and talk about guys and actually be reasonable when confronted with non religious people instead of constantly jabbering about god.

The flip side of this potentially ""realistic"" portrayal is that it may just be so terribly written and acted that it is only accidentally believable. The acting is indeed terrible, yet ironically it is about the exact same caliber of stilted, awkwardly wooden acting that you get from true crime documentary re-enactments. If that were the intention, it would better explain the bad acting, while throwing in the potential mystery of what the hell happened in the editing room to edit out the ""documentary style"".

The plot is a boring foray into this group scouting out a supposedly haunting house and experiencing spooky ghosty events using some of the worst little visual effects and clumsily spliced in backmasked audio.

Virtually nothing happens other than some scattered, unconvincing ""ghost"" appearances while the people involved all bicker and fight constantly, mostly with Mary Young. These encounters are hilarious for all the wrong reasons, and culminate in the obvious revelation that Mary Young was not originally invited by the owner of the house as she'd said, but just a crackpot member of the murder victim's church who occasionally shows cult-like devotion to him and his memory.

While the group finds mounting evidence that the original man of the house was a bad and devious man, Mary Young refuses to hear of it and has a freakout that leads to her leaving. She then calls in to a religious radio show complaining about them, and then comes back to wear a weird religious box-helmet thing, then kill them all, or something. It's not entirely clear what was happening.

After that, we get an extremely long sequence, filmed even more in true crime documentary re-enactment style, with Mary Young's voice-over narration. Turns out the original man of the house was a very bad man, as he takes in a moronic couple's teenage daughter who they say has been a ""whore"", and chains her up in the attic and rapes her repeatedly over several weeks. The wife is fully aware of all this, and the husband also has sex with her, while making her wear the religious box-helmet contraption. The girl gets pregnant and gives birth, and the wife finally loses it and the murder we saw at the beginning is revealed in full, and it's then revealed the baby didn't drown in the bathtub and was rescued by a police cop named Mortenson, and it's revealed that baby was Mary Young Mortenson, who then comes out of the narration and kills herself in the same way as the wife did.

Rather than ending now, the film goes on painfully to apparently show Carter as a ghost in the house now, and by this point the story has long since ended and what unfolds here is a sad epilogue to a poorly-made film lamenting the fate of a character no one cares about.",1521158400,,5094,4.76530612244898

The acting is contrived and forced.  ""MaryJane"" in the movie is nothing more than a cliche... and a really bad and cliche at that.
I've seen worse movie, but I don't recommend anyone else watching this.  It was just bad... all over.
Oh, and as an added bonus, this movie has what HAS to be the worst ever fight between two females in the movie. You have been warned!",1512518400,,536,4.383838383838384
