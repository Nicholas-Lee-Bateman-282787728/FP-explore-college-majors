8326106,5,B0014SQ4IO,"I lived in Slovenia for 3 years.  I had certainly understood bits and pieces of this conflict.  No one has put it together is such a way as this.  The interviews for this documentary are juxtaposed side by side with key players telling slightly different versions of certain events.  The a priori understanding is that the Serbs were mostly responsible for causing this war, but it is even-handed in its portrayal as events unfold.  The footage of battles was also impressive.  I would heartily recommend to anyone interested in the Balkans.",1309132800,2,541,4.8901098901098905
