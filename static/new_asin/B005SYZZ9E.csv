4887815,5,B005SYZZ9E,"This film, for me, has it all -- intrigue, romance, humor, the Italian countryside, Rossano Brazzi, and one hell of a dilemma: a mother, whose dearest wish is oddly granted -- a little girl who will never grow up and leave her (because she can't -- kicked in the head by a horse -- a 26-year-old woman trapped at the mental age of ten), and whether to give this precious daughter to the darling young man who has unexpectedly fallen in love with her.  Mother travels around Italy with the girl in order to avoid her husband's wishes: to institutionalize the poor little thing so that he and his wife can finally have a marriage.  Of course, Mom's not having it, so she simply avoids going home.  A rather odd series of events happen to bring the young Italian man to Clara (Yvette Mimieux), and he falls hopelessly in love with her.  The incredible thing is that he loves her exactly as she is, and so does his family.  Clara's mother, Mrs. Johnson (played perfectly by Olivia de Havilland) knows the relationship is inappropriate, and knows it's up to her to end it, but finds herself in a quandary when her husband shows up, tired of waiting for her and ready to take his family back to the states.  His wife tells him she needs time to help Clara adjust, so he goes home without her.  Fabrizio, the young Italian man (played by, believe it or not, George Hamilton!  And he was great!) thinks he's been rejected because he's Italian, so his father (Rossano Brazzi) takes over the duty of charming Clara's mother and showing her how much they all love Clara.  This throws Mrs. Johnson into a moral conundrum -- let the girl marry the young man and never tell the family about her, or take her home, where her life will virtually be over -- but the outcome is brilliant.  You will get out of your seat and cheer.  YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM.  IT CAN'T BE EXPLAINED IN WORDS.  It must be experienced.  The only two films that I might possibly love as much are CASABLANCA and TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT, but in spite of the thousands of films I've seen, when I'm watching this one, I can't remember loving any of the others even close to the same.  Where, oh where, is the DVD?  (And PLEASE, PLEASE digitally restore it!)  Once you see it, you'll need to go to Firenze.  You won't be able to help yourself.",1204588800,66,2294,4.395734597156398

I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that's only good for around 5 - 7 years.

4887846,3,B005SYZZ9E,"A wealthy American woman (de Havilland) takes her sweet but brain-damaged daughter (Mimieux) to Italy, where a local man (Hamilton) attaches himself to them and immediately falls for the girl.

I enjoyed Olivia de Havilland's fine performance as the elegant, over-protective mother. Yvette Mimieux was perfectly cast as the fragile and beautiful woman who will never grow up.  On the other hand, I couldn't buy George Hamilton as an Italian stud-muffin; he looked ridiculous and the love-at-first-sight plot was unbelievable.

While the scenery of Florence was lovely, the print quality was very poor and almost unwatchable.  A time capsule from Hollywood in 1962, when tourists wore hats and gloves and Italian men were always on the make, this is just an okay film.",1429142400,2,767,5.211382113821138

4887852,3,B005SYZZ9E,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I am not aware of many 10 year olds who persuade such true affection from all around them, a joie de vivre, a profound knowledge of the Italian language and tremendous ease and comfort in a foreign country. I consider these aspects most appealing, mature, and far ahead of most young women I know here in the states.

Retarded? If you actually know someone who is afflicted with mental regression you observe that even simple comprehension is extremely limited and a very narrow hope for a semblance of normal life, i.e. married with children.

I was insulted that they could buy off the Catholic Church to speed up the marriage without conversion and the emphasis on the dowry and general concept of Italian ignorance. However, having visited that country and inheriting Napolitan blood I agree, superficial is the captivating summary save for the great artists.

Perhaps this situation would prove workable given the supposition of money takes care of responsibilities and joy lasts just a bit longer with limited stress.

Italian men tend to be lustful wanderers and fortunately she may never notice his attentions elsewhere. Ignorance is most blissful and we root for this couple to pursue happiness for a lifetime. I chose to leave it at that and mother and father could resume their life together, smoking till death soon to part.

The backdrop was magnificent of Florence, Venice, Rome and carried the weaker moments of the film. Hamilton's accent is so inferior to Mimieux's that is was laughable but delightful to see him sans smug smile and ubiquitous tan.

High recommend for Olivia fans, her performance was subtle, sweet, demur but valiantly hopeful. Love is a many splendid thing and this film tempts to prove it is available to all who seek it.",1421107200,,1801,4.924092409240924
4887853,5,B005SYZZ9E,"The best ""chick flick"".  A true love story, full of sweet innocence. By today's standards, it's sappy, but it transports the viewer to a ""kinder, gentler"" time.

I can't understand why Amazon uses such a bad version on their Instant Video streaming, when a terrific version is being sold by the Warner Archives.  That version is fully widescreen, with 16x9 anamorphic video and beautiful vibrant colors.

4887858,3,B005SYZZ9E,"This is beautifully produced, filmed and acted but I find the deception at the heart of the movie's resolution to be very troubling.  I'm not
certain that the male lead, played surprisingly well by George Hamilton, is aware of how backward intellectually the Yvette Mimieux character is.  Also I'm not certain that the daughter is prepared for what awaits her in married life.  It's a feel good romantic comedy-drama that is unfortunately for my taste a bit too shallow.  These issues could have been addressed in a more mature fashion with the same ending, and having been addressed would have been a more satisfying conclusion.",1415836800,3,629,4.961904761904762
4887859,5,B005SYZZ9E,"The sanctity and strength of the heart
Someone somewhere said or wrote: ""Make big decisions with your heart; leave the small ones to your head.""  And so it goes.  Rich American mother and daughter on Italian holiday are trumped by life's priorities, in this case: love.  Plenty of movies in the genre (The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, The Godfather, Under the Tuscan Sun which  usually produce the delight of  watching American cultural pretenses shattered by the operatic Italian psyche.  Ah, the sheer drama!  The conflict:  a classic dilemma:  safe way versus happy risky way.  So, smile throughout this movie, clearly enjoyed by the actors,  but will you be touched or miss the closing scene?  On the church steps in her wedding dress, the bride reaches down and.............?  And if the altar of love is about anything, it's about surrendering to the triumph of two becoming one, yet not losing individuality.  A worthy watch that even a jaundiced teenager will grudgingly remember on their 25th wedding anniversary.",1414713600,,1021,5.0359281437125745

It's packed with excellent performances from the entire cast especially from Yvette Mimieux who plays the daughter of Olivia DeHavilland's character. George Hamilton who is American, plays a very convincing Italian in this movie. The story is very touching, well written and directed by Guy Green. It has it's moments of comedy, romance and dramaticism. It's a shame this movie didn't do better at the Box Office.

4887894,5,B005SYZZ9E,"I have just seen the REMASTERED EDITION (from Warner Archives) of the recent DVD for LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA which came out a few months ago.

Olivia de Havilland is a worried mother travelling through scenic Italian locations with daughter Yvette Mimieux, who is mentally retarded. When a young Italian starts courting her daughter and showing up in the most unlikely places, de Havilland's predicament becomes apparent. Should she tell the truth or let her daughter marry the rather simple-minded Italian boy? It's a predicament that is nicely solved by the time we get to the fadeout with de Havilland declaring: ""I did the right thing...I know I did.""

Under Guy Green's direction, and photographed with gorgeous images of Italy's landmarks in Rome and Florence, the latest DVD transfer of ""Light in the Piazza"" is a sight to behold. And the intimate story of a mother's wish to find happiness for her daughter rather than giving in to the idea of shutting her away, is told with a good deal of humor and charm thanks to splendid performances from the stars and an intelligent script.

The Epstein brothers have given the screenplay some grace and humor--and de Havilland is superb as the doting mother. Rosanno Brazzi adds his brand of charm to the boy's father and there is a light touch of romance between him and de Havilland.

George Hamilton is surprisingly convincing and utterly charming as the smitten Italian youth, Yvette Mimieux shines as the girl and Barry Sullivan does what he can with the thankless role of her stubborn father who would rather see her placed in an institution. All of it is nicely photographed in Italian locales and in wide-screen Technicolor (see the letterbox version if you can).

This unappreciated film is a minor gem--poignant, touching and humorous. Olivia de Havilland, decked out in a Christian Dior wardrobe, is very attractive in one of her best mature roles. Her chemistry with Rossano Brazzi is so strong that you wish more had been made of the romantic feelings developing between them, but all of their scenes together are expertly played with fine nuances.

Like fine wine, it gets better with time.",1325894400,26,2149,4.90633608815427

I still have my old VHS copied off the TV and it's NOT grainy.  I recorded it without commercials, and I can live with that until a truly re-mastered or digitally restored DVD comes out.  For $18 I expect a product worth adding to my collection.",1323648000,4,432,4.584415584415584

the Story is wonderful and Yvette Mimieux plays her part wonderful.

Well, I like very much George Hamilton.. but here I'm disappointed of his acting. With his suits he wear he looks to much american and his acting as an italian young man is terrible.

DVD: the Picture quality is not so good in any few scenes but acceptable.

Subtitles: none

Trivia: on a point when Mrs. Johnson crossing the street befor she enter the consulate, we can see clearly people where watching the filming.

4887897,4,B005SYZZ9E,"I'm a screenwriter.  I've seen a LOT of movies.  Most of what was worth seeing since the 70's and everything I missed as a child and before.  I'm as familiar with 40's Bette Davis as I am with Lars Von Trier (thanks TCM).  And so after all these stories and directors and years of research --

-- I've discovered two of my favorite films are by a director I had never heard of.  That likely goes for you too.  His name is Guy Green.  His two best I've seen are Sidney Poitier's A PATCH OF BLUE and the charming feature LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA.  Both stories are about a young love... an impossible love... where love conquers all.  Sure, old school melodrama, but if the very words 'Harry Potter' make you sick at modern cinema, you've just found two gems for your jewelry box.

I won't say anything more about this movie but to say it's the type of movie you can watch with a child or grandmother in the room and never flinch once.  That said, it's charming beyond words, and wall to wall eye and heart candy.  Don't fear it's some sappy Hallmark Hall Of Fame silliness.  There are adult issues... and they're handled in an admirably adult way.

The reason I offer this new 'remastered' DVD only 3.7 stars is that it isn't remastered in the slightest.  If I'm wrong, if it actually is remastered, the original print must have been used toilet paper.  This faded speckled mess of a print is an education in the difference between remastering and restoring a classic film.

LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA is not only deserving of a restoration... but a re-release.  It's that good.",1322697600,4,1565,4.447183098591549

This is obviously remastered and is lovely with all the scenes of Italy. Its just a lovely story and very well acted throughout. Really perfectly cast. I don't particularly care for Barry Sullivan but he plays a not so nice guy so I didn't mind him in this. Good casting. For anyone who hasn't seen it I would recommend that they order it as its a ""keeper"".",1321056000,3,503,4.142857142857143
4887900,5,B005SYZZ9E,"Based on Elizabeth Spencer's novella, ""Light in the Piazza"", is a tender, poignant tale about a mildly mentally impaired young woman, who travels to Italy with her mother, in the 1960's, and finds love. This film is heartwarming, romantic, and inspiring. Despite the subject matter it is not a heavy movie. The majority of the film is very upbeat, even humorous, at times. Yvette Mimieux gives an endearing performance as the sweet, joyfull and childlike Clara Johnson. Olivia de Havilland is very convincing as her loving but conflicted mother, Meg. And a young George Hamilton delivers what is perhaps his finest performance ever, as the charming and sensitive Italian boy, Fabrizio, who falls madly in love with Clara. It's a beautiful film that you'll never forget.

4887902,5,B005SYZZ9E,I can't add much to what the others have said. This movie has it all. From the very beginning I was interested and enjoyed it. The acting was excellent and Italy was beautiful. This may be one of the top ten best movies I've ever seen. This movie deserves restoration and transfer to DVD.,1270771200,5,288,4.351851851851852
4887903,5,B005SYZZ9E,"This movie has everything - Olivia de Havilland, Rossano Brazzi, beautiful young people in love and Florence, Italy in a starring role.  The pathos, humor and romance in this movie will stay with you a while. The unexpected twists elevate this movie from almost all others of this genre.

What I don't get is why this movie is unavailable on DVD.  Its themes are so relevant today - especially with autism out on the rise. This movie is not about autism, but brings up salient issues about what to do with an adult special needs child. It bring up such issues as the dreams you have for your child, when and if you should abandon those dreams, and what to do if you and your spouse don't agree on a certain course of action.  The speech Olivia de Hallivand gives her husband in the course a conversation in Rome made me want to cry and stand up and cheer at the same time.  And I don't say that often.  It also shows the isolation one feels as a parent of a special needs  child when making life-altering decisions.

While all this is a theme in the movie, let me stress that this movie is lighthearted, fun and full of romance.  Some of it in unexpected places.

The true miracle of this movie is that they were able to pull all of this off.",1252108800,7,1242,4.291845493562231
4887904,4,B005SYZZ9E,"I saw this movie on TCM a week ago. While I enjoyed the movie and performances were good, story and plot pretty good, what I really enjoyed was the back drop of the movie, Florence, Italy. If you have ever visited Florence, you will be delighted in this movie. Much of the movie takes place outside and very familiar places in Florence. I plan on buying the dvd when it becomes available. You don't find many movies that have Florence as the back drop, let alone show you many of the famous places in Florence.",1223942400,7,510,4.378947368421053
4887905,4,B005SYZZ9E,"""Light in the Piazza"" (1962) stars Olivia de Havilland as a protective American mother travelling with her beautiful daughter (Clara, played by Yvette Mimieux) through Italy.  When they stop in Florence, they meet the charming Fabrizio (George Hamilton), who attempts to date Clara.  However, as the couple fall in love, de Havilland seems determined to stop their blossoming romance.  Gradually, the reasons behind de Havilland's protectiveness are revealed, which allows the movie to explore some interesting questions about why people fall in love, who has the right to love, and what parents should want for their children.

The movie was adapted from a novella by southern author, Elizabeth Spencer, and directed by Guy Green (""A Patch of Blue"").  Overall, ""Light in the Piazza"" is a solid and interesting drama that provides Olivia de Havilland with one of her best late-career roles.  Yvette Mimieux is also very good as the simple Clara, nicely capturing the character's innocence and adolescent-like yearnings.  As noted earlier, the movie tackles some interesting moral questions; unfortunately, the end product is too glossy to add much to a serious debate.  However, the film is a nice example of the type of slick ""issues"" melodramas popular in the 1950s and 1960s; it's not on par with the work of Douglas Sirk (""Imitation of Life"") but may appeal to the same audience.

As of September 2008, ""Light in the Piazza"" has not been released on DVD, which is puzzling considering that it was successfully adapted into a musical stage production that won the Tony for Best Score in 2005.  Hopefully, ""Light in the Piazza"" will get the attention it deserves via a DVD release.",1221523200,22,1683,5.087272727272727
