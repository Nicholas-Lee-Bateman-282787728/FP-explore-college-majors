Manet uses a lot of very vivid colors including black in his painting and some of the images especially Olympia comes out so dark it is almost all black.  Too bad, I so looked forward to this movie.  The information was fairly ok though. I will look at it again anyway.  For good Manet images go to Rosamund Bernier Impressionists series on four videos, especially the one entitled Modern Art and Modern Manners.  These videos are all available used or new on Amazon or Barnes and Noble.  I hope someday someone will make a really well done retrospective on DVD of Manet's work",1103846400,11,748,4.586466165413534

All this gives a feel of a very low budget movie

this of course doesn't make it a cheap one to buy.",1103846400,11,350,4.132352941176471
