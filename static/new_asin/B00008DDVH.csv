1835500,2,B00008DDVH,"In order to do this workout, you must be very coordinated, able to move quickly, and able to look past the distorted variation of hula dancing.  You can get a good workout (if you can keep up) but if you're interested in learning hula, this is not the right video.  The movement in this video is very fast, rigid, and down right ugly.  True traditional hula is a graceful, beautiful expression of mind, body, and spirit that can provide a spiritual and physical workout when performed properly.",1062720000,11,494,4.655172413793103
1835601,4,B00008DDVH,I like this hula series with this particular instructor because she is easy to follow. The landscape scenery is nice and the music is soothing. As for the weight loss I can't say at this point because I haven't been doing it lately but I'll update this review when I dedicate myself to it.,1368576000,,289,4.37037037037037
1835602,4,B00008DDVH,"It's not quite what I expected, but I can do most of the moves even with my bad hip. Love the music and the titles to the dances.

Would think, however, it would be more for an intermediate dancer than a beginner.",1364342400,,213,4.071428571428571
1835603,4,B00008DDVH,This was challenging and a lot of fun. I love to dance so it didn't feel like exercise and I really felt like I had had a great workout afterwards and the next day! Would recommend!,1359763200,,181,4.055555555555555
1835604,4,B00008DDVH,This was a great purchase easy to follow instructions and fun to work out with especially alone or with a group.,1357776000,,112,4.380952380952381
1835605,5,B00008DDVH,Absoutly worth it. If you do it rigt and faithfully wworkout . It does work really really good. And at the same time learn how to hula!! CCHIIIOOOO,1353628800,,147,4.285714285714286
1835606,5,B00008DDVH,I received this product in a few days from purchase.  I had this product in vhs and am glad to have it on dvd.  I was in great condition.,1352073600,,137,3.689655172413793
1835607,5,B00008DDVH,"Very enjoyable. Tougher than it looks, but lots of fun. My sister and I are getting fit and laughing alot.",1346284800,,106,4.35
1835608,5,B00008DDVH,"This little lady sure knows how to move her hips. My wife and I tried it too, the full first CD at once. Result, lots of fun, sweaty clothing and three days of muscle pain! After a few monts, our muscles became visible again! No pain, no gain. You should try it!",1321747200,,262,4.0576923076923075
1835609,4,B00008DDVH,"Kili is a very good instructor, especially for an overweight, out of shape novice.  My only objection is that there are lots of close-up shots where you can't see her entire body in motion.  I'm sure that was to create interest in the video, but it's annoying.  Hawaii is beautiful scenery; no reason to cut off her head or her feet.",1316649600,3,333,4.426229508196721
1835610,3,B00008DDVH,I enjoyed this entire series. The setting is beautiful and it is extremely easy to follow.  Very detailed in instructing you how to move along with the music.,1296518400,,158,4.642857142857143
1835745,5,B00008DDVH,just got to say this is the best for us hawaiians that moved away from home its a great way to keep that hula in our lives. but for all that don't or haven't done this before this is a very hard workout your hips will burn and you might now be able to walk for a couple of days cause hula is all about the hips and no matter what you doing  in this video your hips will be moving the whole time. i love this video a way to dance with nice motions and a way to keep your body in shape. love it.,1284422400,6,493,3.650943396226415
1835746,2,B00008DDVH,"I own 2 other workouts by Kali that are wonderful and have really nice traditional style drumming.
These DVD's have some horribly cheesy music that in my opinion would make Don Ho sick.
Hope the workouts are decent, honestly I haven't had the guts to try them yet - it is really that hokey.",1281571200,,290,4.388888888888889
1835747,4,B00008DDVH,This was a fantastic buy except for the fact that 1 of the 2 disks skips. The workout had me sweating after the warm up. It's a fun and different way to get exercise. I enjoyed it very much. I would recommend for those who can keep up I do think it goes very quickly and isn't great for people who need to go through it multiple times before moving on.,1278892800,,352,3.971830985915493
1835748,5,B00008DDVH,"For those who want to get some exercise in a unique way.  The women in this DVD are really shapely and trim and it makes you want to be that way too.  The cardio effect is plenty for the average women and boy is it great for low back problems.  I like it so much I have just purchased the Tahitian Cardio workout by the same group.  Use this on days after a more aerobic workout for a nice, elegant change of pace.  The background drum music is great on this DVD.  Recommended!",1275609600,3,477,4.075268817204301
1835749,5,B00008DDVH,So much fun!!!!  Very easy moves that actually make you feel like you worked out!!  great dvd!,1250467200,,94,4.470588235294118
1835750,4,B00008DDVH,"1: To get full benifit from these DVDs I recomend buying an aerobic dance DVD and learning all the moves they do, then mentally subtracting them from Kili's routine so you have a more-or-less authentic version of hula technique.

2: Although the music is cheesey (a lot) it is authentic Hawaiian... post Elvis.  If you can stand it, the music gives clues to how the arms function in relation to lyrics although the tune is more American '60s pop than Island ballad.  Kili's other DVDs (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Island-Girl-Dance-Fitness-Workout-for-Beginners-Cardio-Hula/dp/B0002ILKBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Island Girl Dance Fitness Workout for Beginners: Cardio Hula</a>) use drum choruses and the story-telling gets lost without context.

3: Kili is filming in Hawaii.  Its 80* or so, her muscles won't need to warm up or cool down as much as those of us who spend our Wisconson winters dreaming of tropical dance parties.  Run those sections twice.",1178668800,5,1001,5.775510204081633
1835751,3,B00008DDVH,"Most of the moves were authentic, her style of teaching was great & easy to follow, the workout style/use of time was great, but the dance routine itself was a bit silly w/cutsy 60s music & added 60s american dance moves but still have a lot of authetic hula dancing.

Her new ""Island Girl"" hula workouts are more authentic. Just like her other ones, you get a great workout, your abs burn, your hips, legs get a nice workout. It's all authentic dance moves with some added quick squats, etc. added in so you barely notice it for adding toning. The authentic drum Hawaiian music is beautiful & does keep you stimulted too keep going just like a dance/rock beat would.

I had no trouble following & learning the steps, there are plenty of dance DVDs that I have had trouble with, but she breaks everything down well & shows it slowly several times before speeding it up. She even cues YOUR left & right, not hers.

There's a trailer for her ""Hula Workout"" DVDs & another authentic Hula workout like this called ""Island Girl: Hula Abs & Buns"" at collagevideo.com",1151452800,5,1060,4.539267015706806
1835752,1,B00008DDVH,"I bought this series for something extra and fun to add to my workouts but what I got was an annoying dvd that I never use.

The workout is not exactly low impact but it also doesnt get your heartrate up enough to really be effective. The music is bad, the production is bad and the instructor is really annoying.

Skip it.",1092700800,14,323,4.193548387096774
1835753,1,B00008DDVH,"I should have listened to the other reviewers and avoided these DVDs -- Truly disappointing.
The routines are not graceful or traditional unless you consider jump-steps and can-can kicks elements of hula.
My score ... ""ewww"" and ""yuk"" to both DVDs.",1089072000,18,248,5.073170731707317
1835754,1,B00008DDVH,"Cheesy to the max and not truly low-impact (unless you consider hopping and jumping low-impact). You learn a tacky, boring routine rather than any traditional hula...don't waste your money, I wish I could've gotten a refund but since I opened it to use it, was ""not returnable"" at least not for full purchase price.",1084492800,14,315,4.851851851851852
7981716,5,B00008DDVH,Great way to learn the Hula and get a great workout at the same time. I would highly recommend this product.,1513382400,,108,4.190476190476191
7981717,5,B00008DDVH,"This is a great 2-DVD set!  I don't know how there are a few who are critical of the workout, and her. She is a wonderful, graceful dancer and taught the sequence well; not to mention the beautiful views.",1498435200,2,204,4.230769230769231

7981720,5,B00008DDVH,This is a great workout. I have lost a lot weight from it and I love the dances.,1467072000,,80,3.5
7981721,1,B00008DDVH,It says its for beginners but it's not. Once she gets into it she goes to fast and puts to many moves together to fast. I found it very hard to keep up...used it once. She is a beautiful dancer though.,1450396800,,201,3.926829268292683
7981722,5,B00008DDVH,great workout,1404432000,,13,6.0
7981723,4,B00008DDVH,"I love this hula workout!  I sing the tune, ""Hula Rock Mama,"" and do the dance anywhere and everywhere, including on a Sunset Dinner cruise in Key West!  The instructions for hip circles were the best breakdown that I've ever seen.  People should not expect to master the hip movements immediately.  I've studied belly dance, and even at the end of a year of study, there wasn't the hip definition I wanted.  But I got it about three months after beginning the hula program!  Really, these basic hula steps are a great start! Put a scarf around your hips for maximum enjoyment of your hip motions.",1378166400,,597,4.584905660377358
7981724,5,B00008DDVH,"This 2-DVD box set is a Hula Workout set that features a variety of hula and Polynesian dance moves, all performed by world-reknowned hula dancer ""Kili"". The special features includes two special hula performances by ""Kili"", as well as previews of other NaturalJourneys DVD titles, like Bellytwins and Suhaila's bellydance DVD's. This is perfect for any hula fan.",1372118400,,363,5.275862068965517
7981725,5,B00008DDVH,"I loved this two set DVD. I had already purchased 'Island Girl Dance Fitness Workout for Beginners Hula Abs and Buns' and gave it a 5 star too. I still workout to it.

Kili teaches us routines slowly, incorporating the key movements of the hula with her exercise workout. By the end of the DVD, we've learned an entire routine while toning our bodies.

I am soon to be 63 and I now have some health problems, so I no longer can do stressful aerobics, plus I'd begun to have hip problems. Sometimes it got bad enough that I had to use a cane. Walking or light jogging hurt my hip even more.

BUT - here's the best part of Kili workouts - my hip no longer hurts. How great is that? However, a word of caution - definitely check with your doctor if you have any health problems or hip problems before starting and type of exercise or dance fitness.

I must say, I don't understand the low ratings that complain of Kili not being traditional. Did they want a workout or to learn the traditional hula dances, and which tradional hula are they talking about? Kili's style is basic hula (auana style) including all the movements you would learn in a hula class - a modern-day hula class.

Thanks to Kili's training, I now have begun to learn hula dancing in the style taught with Western influence music and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.

As for the spiritual aspect, in no way does Kili ever insult the spiritual side of hula. I can't help but wonder if those reviewers wanted to learn the traditional spiritual with chants. If that's what they wanted, why buy a dance fitness workout? Have they ever watched true kahiko?

Kili, I absolutely LOVE your workouts. Ignore the bad reviews and keep on teaching us how to tone and lose weight by the wonderful, graceful, gentle art of hula.

As for me, I will continue to purchase Kili DVD's!",1370131200,7,1828,4.452095808383233
