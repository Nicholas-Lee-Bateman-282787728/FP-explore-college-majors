1968666,2,B00013A0E2,"After watching this DVD, I can safely say that with the exception of couples massage in the privacy of your own home, that most (if not all) regulated states would never allow the routine shown to be done for the public.  The draping was horrible, one of the therapists had long hair that wasn't tied back (was touching the client's skin),and some of the longer strokes down the back and up the legs were extended underneath the towel/blanket.  The Esalen Institute is based in California where there obviously aren't strict ethical boundries established...as say in..NY where I'm licensed.  A few of the strokes might be adapted for massage to the public however.  The only good thing I can really comment on is the scenery...if you're thinking about designing a garden or deck to do outdoor massage, you might get some decorating ideas.  All in all, I'd rate it a 2 out of 5 stars.",1076803200,26,883,4.707792207792208
1968667,3,B00013A0E2,"I feel somewhat disappointed of the DVD because it fell sort of my expectations. As a keen Lomi Lomi connoisseur, when I saw the trailer of Esalen, I was immediately thrilled by the concept of ""the quality of touch"". I enjoy integrating new techniques in my routines as I easily get bored doing the same thing all over a couple of times a day every day. The production of the Esalen DVD looked great, the setting totally fit the spirit they talked about in the trailer. I was hooked.

One thing I was right about: there isn't a better place to shoot a massage video, than Big Sur. The setting is very beautiful and relaxing and chosen with taste. In the first several minutes we are introduced the essence of Esalen massage and some general fundamentals. We are told that what sets it apart from other styles of massage is the attitude and the gentle care we put in our work. What I did not expect to learn is that it's totally free-style.

The way they decide to make it was include short segments of many practitioners talking about their interpretation of Esalen while showing various moves. I did not count but I believe there were at least 10 of them. So it's a full body massage and one therapist picks up where the previous one has left off. It's an interesting approach and obviously the idea was to show diversity and most of all to emphasize on personal approach and customization. However, I have some objections to this:

1. Watching so many people within 70 minutes was confusing to me. I believe they would have achieved more clarity if only 3 or 4 of them took turns speaking in the whole video.

2. There was nothing on the technical side of the massage. While I fully understand that they wanted to lay stress elsewhere, I did hope that they would actually *teach* some of what they showed. I saw several awesome moves but when I tried to apply them, the lack of instruction of how they are actually done made it very difficult for me. This is especially true for the side-lying position. They say ""when you watch the DVD all over many times, you'll get the hang of them"".  But then again there are so many routines uploaded everywhere on the Internet.

3. I wish the practitioners on the DVD would at least show us a favorite `trick' of theirs or a signature move and break it down. Most times the camera is focused on what the hands are doing and we hear the voiceover but what about the posture and body mechanics?

4. The 10 and 20 minute routines are no routines in fact. They are excerpts from the full body massage. Nothing extra at all is added.

5. On the jewelcase it is said that ""you'll be able to view the video (...) and at the same time give an Esalen massage to your husband, wife, friend or lover"". Indeed, after viewing it I strongly believe it is geared towards massage therapists working on their intimate partners, rather than on clients. If this is the case/intention, I wish it had been more explicitly stated.

On a side note here, I don't agree with some of the other reviewers here on the subject of nudity in the DVD. It is our duty as massage therapists to inform our clients of the modalities of bodywork we practice and let them have their informed choice. I firmly believe that more conservative clients would always rather go for Swedish, than Esalen. We shouldn't worry about violating their privacy if they confirm they are comfortable with this modality in general and with minimal draping.

I am giving only 3 stars to this otherwise wonderful video because it fails to instruct. It's a carefully chosen setting and obviously an expensive production to make the way they did. This, however, has made the end product quite costly. I have a small collection of similarly priced massage videos most of which by Real Bodywork. It is the comparison to informative approach I saw there that made me determined to shave off the second star as well. If your primary goal when purchasing a massage video is to get detailed instruction with a breakdown, this may not be the right choice for you.

Nonetheless, I would like to recommend this video to:

-- MTs looking for a less formal approach to giving a massage to their spouses/SOs.
-- MTs interested in a more spiritual approach to treating their clients.
-- Anyone who's been at the EI and taken classes there. This is the perfect companion and a great reference to go by.",1233014400,14,4370,4.538754764930115
1968668,5,B00013A0E2,"I recently spent ten days at Esalen and enjoyed four wonderful massages. I wanted to reconnect to the Esalen energy and found this DVD.

It is wonderful, to see the Esalen and to re-experience the peaceful energry of the Esalen massage! This DVD is practical and easy to watch and learn. It is so peaceful I fell asleep before the end.

I highly recommend this DVD!",1226275200,,365,4.515151515151516
1968669,5,B00013A0E2,"5 stars because it's comprehensive and the only thing I wish it had was maybe an opportunity to listen to the way an Esalen massage practitioner would introduce this form of massage to a client for the first time, including some of the words he/she may say to client at the beginning and again at the end.

I personally have not been to Esalen, but have had massage from one trained there. The draping used was similar to that in the dvd here, and the LMT practiced in California. I was comfortable with the draping but again as another reviewer mentioned, as long as the therapist communicates with the client and is clear as to the client's preference, there is leeway for a variety of draping styles.

The dvd has a full 75 minute viewing option, as well as shorter mini sessions which cut to just the head/neck/shoulders and also the back sections of the same video in 10 and 20 minute sessions.

The music in the video is very nice: Michael Benghiat - check At Peace Music out!

I found it to be skillfully edited and some of the suggestions that resonated with me as a licensed massage therapist the most were:

-approach each massage with mindfulness
-the quality of attitude is more important than doing ""a routine"", and whenever one finds that he/she is ""planning"" the next move, the Esalen suggestion is to pause in your mind and refocus on the client and the moment at hand. Planning results in a mechanistic type of massage and believe it that your client will be able to tell the difference.
- alternate between long continuous strokes and smaller detail work to keep the massage flowing but not predictable, because if the client is able to predict your next move, it keeps them in their minds, while the practice of Esalen technique and the (unplanned) feeling of the massage will allow the client to fully relax, mind and body.

Highly recommended - but those who buy this DVD need to be open to the type of massage and mindfulness that is represented here. You probably know if that is you or not.",1224115200,4,2014,4.565096952908587
1968670,5,B00013A0E2,"I am a licensed massage therapist and I have learned much from this video. It's also a great video for someone who wants to give a massage to their loved one and is not a professional. The scenery is gorgeous and you can easily see the moves the therapists are doing. I hope to someday go to Big Sur, CA and get to experience the Esalen massage myself. Be forewarned, there is some nudity in this video. This massage technique involves long, continuous strokes unimpeded by a drape, sheet, or clothing. This is a very relaxing feeling and something everyone should have the pleasure of experiencing. I highly recommend this video.",1221177600,5,630,4.684684684684685
1968671,5,B00013A0E2,"This is an excellent dvd covering Esalen massage. The setting of the dvd is at Esalen Institute in Big Sur, CA and is quite picturesque with the ocean and rugged coastline in the background. Esalen massage is a beautiful heart-centered experience characterized by an almost meditative masseuse/client connection. This is done with the use of long flowing strokes, thoughtful pauses between transitions to allow the client to absorb the experience, and the use of intuition to tailor each session to the client's needs at that time. Yes, the draping as demonstrated on the dvd is much more casual than ""standard"" massages, but the draping can and should be adjusted to client preference/comfort, that is just common sense. No, it is not meant to be ""erotic"" massage but it certainly would be a great massage technique for couples. Even better than the dvd though would be to go to the Esalen site, sign up for a weekend or 5 day massage class, and experience Esalen in person.",1202601600,6,975,4.879518072289157

1968673,5,B00013A0E2,"The Esalen Massage Video DVD was filmed on location at the Esalen Institute. Esalen is located at the coastal center of the breathtakingly beautiful, rugged Big Sur region of California. Some indoor and several outdoor spots are shown with demonstrations on massage tables in the Huxley meeting room, at the cliff-side Hot Springs Bathhouse overlooking and forty feet above the Pacific Ocean on both the ground floor and the upper deck, on the cliff-edge swimming pool deck one hundred feet above the ocean surf, similarly on the nearby spacious luxuriant lawn, and within one of the lush gardens on this harmonious landscape rendering of the wild and the manicured. In this exquisite production, there are many spectacular scenes taken from a helicopter, as well as still pictures of Esalen's founders: Michael Murphy and Richard Price, and noted early Esalen presenters: Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Ida Rolf, Joseph Campbell, Sam Keen, Christine Stewart Price, and others; a fleeting view of the rustic redwood Lodge, views of the cascading Hot Springs Creek with redwood trees on its banks, a favorite charming meditation spot: the landing on the stairway from the Big House to the beach, and of other awe-inspiring spots on this magical property.

In this 85-minute production, nearly all thirty-six members of the Esalen Massage Crew appear, if not as givers, then as receivers, with some as both. Twenty-two, as givers, appear with first names on the screen, with ten as commentators supplementing the mellifluous, informative voice-over that guides the viewer through the total body massage. The world-famous classic Esalen massage moves are demonstrated in stepwise fashion with amazing grace and beauty. The idea of producing an instructional massage video at Esalen dates to at least February 1977, but not until May 1997 was such a product released. The viewer is completely captivated by the presentation in the same way as actually being at Esalen, for both are works of art. Delightful to the eye and uplifting to the spirit, one never tires of repeated viewings.

Said of this award-winning best-selling video production - ""gorgeous, wonderful, beautiful, enlightening, the next best thing to learning at Esalen, the best instructional video on the market, for beginners and professionals alike!""",1158019200,10,2308,5.286103542234333
1968674,4,B00013A0E2,"The video is great and I have incorporated the towel draping in my practice.  Yes i am a CMT with over 1,000 hours of training and have my practice in Colorado.  Most of my clients really love just having a towel including the women and i do get a few who are uncomfortable and we go with a sheet.  The reason for a towel is to make the broad long strokes and not have anything in the way.  If you people who are CMT's or LMT's find that sexual then you need to change professions.  as for being close to the private area, have you ever done adductor work?  You get closer to the private area with adductor work or even lower abs work than you do with Esalen Massage.",1122249600,24,667,4.092307692307692
1968675,2,B00013A0E2,"It's tough to rate this one because I was specifically looking for intimate massage.  The setting is breathtaking, but the presentation is more professional how-to or ""travel destination"".  Nothing intimate or arousing for two people in the privacy of their own home, but they may consider actually going to Esalen for a getaway.",1106870400,3,329,5.188679245283019
1968676,5,B00013A0E2,"I own the Esalen Massage VHS tape and I just bought the Esalen DVD -- it's fantastic.  I use the remote all the time to go to specific parts of the body - and I speak english, but it's also got spanish and german soundtracks. Although the above review comments about draping and hair touching clients is true enough -- I also know from having been to Esalen that all the clients in the video were fellow massage therapists of the folks who were doing the work! So they were all friends. But it's also true that the Esalen Massage DVD is used in a lot of massage schools around the country because massage teachers like the  blending of massage techniques into one, whole body massage. I know  that some massage schools focus heavily on one particular approach, and that often inhibits therapists from developing massage styles that are creative and constantly evolving in order to help their clients. I tell friends that the Esalen DVD is great for couples who want to learn the basics of massage-ing each other -- you can turn it on and follow along. And I'm sure massage school instructors are quick to yell - and don't EVER drape like THAT! But it's a great tool for learning massage without getting bogged down in any particular technique. I wish I could have been one of the lucky ones on the table.",1091059200,31,1304,4.516949152542373

8005847,5,B00013A0E2,very beautiful and inspiring movie. They make it look effortless. A truly holistic approach to massage and you can see that they massage from the heart and with much joy.

The filming of this DVD is fantastic, beautiful location in Hawaii and a good mix of close ups and wide shots to show both the client and the massage therapist.  I watch this video to stay inspired.

Actually, my husband treated me first with an Esalen Massage after viewing the program.  It was wonderful!  Every couple should do this religiously.  It keeps your souls connected.

8005852,5,B00013A0E2,I am a massage therapist.  My teacher showed me the video and I had to incorporate Esalen into my library.  The techniques used in this video are like none other I've ever seen.

8005853,4,B00013A0E2,"I just finished the 28 day massage intensive at Esalen.  I have had the opportunity to watch the video as well as work with some of the people who are practicing in it.  I must say that although the massage style and intent has changed very little since the time of filming, much of the practical elements such as draping and even practitioner apparel have changed with the times.  I think it is a wonderful display of the care and intentions put forth in the craft, but I think it may be time for the staff to create a new video.  As our culture moves forward and times change, so do our impressions of what we see and experience.  So when I see hair styles and even film styles from the past I input the general emotion and cultural intelligence of the time.  If I see someone dancing to Disco with big hair, I think easy sex and cocaine.  When I see minimal draping and big hair, without the backing information and experience I have from being there, I might get the wrong impression.  I can say from experience that the philosophy and intent of everything I learned from Esalen is about care.  Although some elements of the massage style are sensual, there is nothing sexual at all about the craft being taught on the video.  So for you CMT's and bodyworkers out there who have not seen the video I highly recommend this DVD.  For those of you looking for something to improve foreplay and your sex lives, I think there is more useful material out there (I think Penthouse put one out).  Finally, If anyone from the Esalen staff is reading this review, I would encourage you all to produce a contemporary version of the video.  You deserve to give all of the wonderful work you have done over the years some up-to-date justice.",1261526400,7,1732,4.443037974683544
8005854,5,B00013A0E2,"I'm a male Certified Esalen Massage Practitioner with a practice in California, and it's apparent from reading the other reviews that there's a good deal of misunderstanding about the way Esalen Massage is practiced out here.

First, the draping used in this DVD is not typical of the way that I work, nor is it typical of the approach used by any other bodyworker I know. And in Esalen Massage training, held outside of Esalen, standard draping techniques are taught. I'm not opposed to giving a session with a more flexible approach to modesty issues, with a lover or friend, or with another bodyworker, but when dealing with the general public such an approach would be not just inconsiderate and unethical, it would be professional suicide.

In the many trips I've taken to Esalen, most often to watch the therapists work, I have yet to see a recipient draped as liberally as is shown on the DVD. The only ""marginal"" situations I have witnessed were the few occasions where members of the staff worked on each other, and even then draping was always used. At no time have I ever seen anything remotely improper in all the sessions I've observed.

The Esalen Massage DVD shows members of the staff working on each other: these are people who have reached a heightened comfort level with their own bodies and the bodies of others, and it's reasonable to understand that the liberal approach used by them in this context is not typical of the way the work is done outside of Esalen. After all, this DVD is not presented as a How-To for working with the general public. It was created years before Esalen Massage was first taught outside of Esalen, and was intended largely for people who were unfamiliar with the style and wanted to expand their approach to bodywork. And for that purpose it's very successful.

One reviewer suggested that ""there obviously aren't strict ethical boundaries established"" in California. That's both unfair and inaccurate. The city where I'm licensed is typical and has regulations as long as your arm, covering everything from draping to proper attire to exchange of gratuities. Some cities require national certification, which tends to eliminate all but the most dedicated practitioners, and one has to take an assortment of medical tests to become licensed. I should add that as a male practitioner in a female-dominated industry I have had to be especially careful of boundary issues. It's hard enough to get female clients on my table because of trust issues, and the last thing I want to do is give them a reason to not come back.

I was taught during Esalen training, and I think it's excellent advice for all therapists, to always communicate well with the client. If you're not sure about something, ask! The only time I don't ask is when the issue concerns draping a female client, because some clients will be suspicious of the question itself. So I utilize standard draping techniques as a matter of course. If I've worked for some time with a client then sometimes the issue comes up in conversation organically. If it doesn't, I'm not going to mention it. I honor the client by communicating openly and giving them space to ask for what they want; if they don't ask, then that's their decision. I believe that because comfort levels vary so widely one has to be somewhat flexible, but at no time would I ever risk creating discomfort or fear in my clients.

I have a collection of instructional massage DVD's and tapes, and while I use many of them for technique, I use the Esalen DVD for inspiration. It offers a glimpse of a more profound approach to bodywork, and for myself and many other practitioners (as well as our clients!) it's proven to be a path to a deeper, more rewarding experience.",1249948800,27,3743,4.759630200308166
