8200473,4,B000RG17V8,"Having spent 50 years in martial arts in the study of Judo, Tae Kwon Do and Modern Arnis I have see attempts to document moves in video. This does a good job. Grand Master park is one of the best, this only problem is not with the Tae Kwon Do, it is knowing how to produce a video. The video scripting could have been better.",1392768000,,325,4.015384615384615
8200474,3,B000RG17V8,"GM Park is a great Master of Taekwon Do. I have the entire dvd series. I do not think however people expect to see his students when they buy the pattern  DVDs. I imagine people expecting to see him performing patterns or at least high ranking students. In the points he intervenes however he explains well and you can see how great he is. There are much better dvds out there on patterns. Anyway, do not expect to learn patterns from DVD .You should try to get a qualified instructor to  be taught and trained meticulously!",1313971200,2,524,4.447916666666667
8200475,5,B000RG17V8,This DVD only describes the basic kicks some mid-air/flying but Id like to see some more advanced kicks. But totally recommend this to the ITF Taekwon-DO practicioner.,1220918400,,167,5.222222222222222
