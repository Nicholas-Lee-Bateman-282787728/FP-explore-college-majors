7481421,5,B016YZNM0O,A beautiful and funny story about two boys being boys.,1483315200,,54,4.5
7481422,4,B016YZNM0O,"Very touching film illustrating both the difficulties of being ""different"" to your peers and how to overcome the hurt that can follow - and how with some ingenuity and a good friend you can mature and more fully understand the life that surrounds you and can open up to you.  Beautifully filmed and acted.  Very high rating.  4 1/2 stars.",1483315200,4,338,4.6
7481423,5,B016YZNM0O,"Saw it in NYC earlier this year and watched it again. Very ""French"" and very good ... idiosyncratic, no sex, no violence, just a really good story.",1482969600,,147,4.481481481481482
7481424,5,B016YZNM0O,"It's a marvelous movie, highly recommended.

BUT, ZERO STARS for the Amazon app on my TV--almost ruins everything I watch through it.  If you are the type to use FastForward and Rewind extensively, the lack of any visuals of where you are in the movie, beyond the time code, will drive you crazy.  There are delays before the time begins to move and where it stops when you quit pushing the button.",1482192000,,398,4.5
7481425,4,B016YZNM0O,"Charming, discursive, original French road movie about two misunderstood adolescents.  Clever quirky characters and situations.  Drags in a few spots.  Older kids and adults should enjoy this one. Beautiful sunny location photography.",1481328000,,234,6.25
7481426,5,B016YZNM0O,"Great Fun. French or American, building a soapbox motor car or a tree house retreat were the adventuress escapes that many of us as young boys attempted to live out. Microbe and Gasoline brings it to life.",1477353600,,205,4.5675675675675675
7481427,4,B016YZNM0O,"Daniel Guret (Ange Dargent) is already 14, but he hasn't quite made it through puberty. A slender boy with a small frame, fine features, a long mop of a hairdo, and a falsetto voice, the hero of Microbe & Gasoline, from French director Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), is often mistaken for a girl.

Nicknamed Microbe by his schoolmates, he carries around a lot of shame. He seems to have few friends, and while he fantasizes incessantly about his classmate Laura (Diane Besnier), he's too afraid to ask her out.

Daniel's life changes when he befriends transfer student Tho (Thophile Baquet), a supremely confident nonconformist from a poor family. A gifted mechanic who helps his dad fix engines before school, he shrugs off bullies who taunt him for smelling like gasoline.

Outsiders both, Daniel and Tho are prototypical Gondry heroes. But here the indie auteur forgoes his visual pyrotechnics and experimental narrative style to tell a straightforward and delightful coming-of-age yarn.

The first half is a deftly drawn character study that looks at the two schoolboys' relationships with their families and peers. They bond over their mutual hatred for bourgeois life in the small city of Versailles (""We can't blossom,"" Tho complains). Dreaming of escape, they spend their free time building a motor home from scratch.

Once summer vacation starts, they run away, with grand plans of taking a road trip across France in their monstrous creation - it's kind of a ramshackle toolshed on wheels powered by a lawn mower engine.

They have great adventures: They're taken in by a creepy dentist who insists on fixing their smiles, and they get into a violent confrontation with a French-Korean street gang.

Dargent and Baquet are terrific, delivering incredibly relaxed performances as two kids with exceptional intelligence and a burning passion for life. And it's clear they're still kids. Filled with misconceptions about life, about sex, and about adulthood, they spend hours giving each other absurd dating advice.

A cross between Franois Truffaut's sometimes-harrowing dramas about childhood and a Steven Spielberg fantasy, Gondry's film abounds with sentiment - without falling prey to sentimentality.",1477353600,3,2236,5.27887323943662
7481428,5,B016YZNM0O,"""On the road' slowly, with two French teens: better than Kerouac",1477267200,,64,4.909090909090909
8737588,4,B016YZNM0O,"This coming of age film about two boys discovering themselves and their friendship is beautifully acted by  Ange Dargent and Thophile Baquet.  They are Daniel and Tho, or better known as Microbe and Gasoline.

They are 8th graders who don't quite fit the norm.  Microbe is artistic and Gasoline is more mechanical.  They are bored with their lives and their oppressive parents and decide to travel to the Massif Central, where Theo spent a year in school many years ago. They design their own housecar on a lawnmower's engine.

The best part of the film is the conversation between the two boys.  Their incidents along the way are both amusing and thought-provoking, but the adventure does lose its luster 20 minutes before the end.  They return home to start school again.  Will the two reunite?",1524873600,,796,4.837037037037037

I was captivated by their friendship and adventure and loved listening to their philosophical and rather funny conversations. I like to think that they were reunited and remained friends for life!",1500508800,,347,5.196428571428571

8737594,4,B016YZNM0O,"It was great, reminds me of the song:  ""You can't always get what you want""  Loved the story, reminded me somewhat of my boyhood.  Great job of production, good story telling and filming.  I really liked the ending,  c'est la vie!",1486166400,,230,4.512195121951219
8737595,4,B016YZNM0O,A slice of adolescence accurately taken from just about every awkward young teenage boy's life.
