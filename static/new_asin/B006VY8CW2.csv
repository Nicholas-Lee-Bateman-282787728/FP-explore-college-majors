8505232,3,B006VY8CW2,It wasn't as good as I thought it would be but it was a pretty good movie. It's something I would borrow not buy.,1363392000,,113,3.75
8505233,2,B006VY8CW2,"Despite the name of the movie, you won't be shown that much actual gambling. In fact, if you wanted to see a gambling movie about gambling and how that works this isn't at all it. You could count the actual amount of gambling that is going on in the whole movie, and it would be about 8 or 9 minutes! This is one and half hour movie, so this movie is definitely NOT about ""the odds"" of gambling. This movie about the affects of gambling. I thought the movie could had been named better, maybe ""Desson"". Why? Because all you'll sees in the whole movie is Desson. There is not one single time where you won't see Desson.

So, the movie is about Desson, a high school student, that lost a large amount money in illegal High School gambling. The movie starts off like your typical movie where you see Desson helping out his best friend Barry from a bad situation. He then meets his high school female love, Heather. And there's a gambling ring leader, Paul. Then, you continued to see and get to know more about the characters and other characters.

As the movie progresses, Barry body is found dead and now Desson on the hunt to find out who did it. As everyday passes, Desson gets closer and closer to the truth with Barry's murder mystery. By finding out small clues and talking to people, Desson will find out what really happened to Barry.

Towards the end of the movie, you find out more and more about Desson life and maybe Desson isn't the guy, you may have thought he was. At the climax of the movie, Desson actually has a deep dark secret that he hasn't told anyone, even his decease best friend, didn't know about it.

I though this movie had a lot going for it, the story and the characters. But, the movie does fall short on some aspects. Many times, the slow/boring moments and this drag brought down the movie. The movie should had found a way to sped up the movie more, I found myself just waiting for something really interesting to happen. I thought Desson should actually find out more information every time, so he would go on to the next clue scene sooner. Maybe this would have sped up the movie more.

***Spoilers Below***

I didn't like how the movie wanted to do too much with the characters. I believe that the movie wanted to go somewhere with Paul and Terry relationship more, but the movie was all ready dragging out. I believe Terry is actually Paul's Dad because Paul calls him Dad at the end. This would allow more scenes to tell between Terry and Paul, but this wasn't needed and in fact, Paul should had never even said Dad at the end of the movie. Leaves the viewers wondering more about what happened to Terry after the movie and Paul.

The ending itself I didn't like either. The ending doesn't exactly tell you what happens with Desson. He does find the killer of Barry, and he does go to Jail that's good. But, then it goes off and shows the audience that Desson still has a bunch of money from the Terry. Then, it shows that Desson also has a Barry's Cell. So, it is unclear what happens with Desson and the money because then the credit starts. There must be around thousands of dollars in his hands. You see Desson smiling at the end, but what does that mean? Will he keep on gambling? Will he turn in the money to the police? Will he give the money to his Dad? Maybe to Barry's family? Maybe he used the money to rent out an apartment?

It is possible that Desson will give the money to Heather for her gambling debt, but there is too much money there not to be left over. But, it is possible Heather doesn't even have a debt anymore because Paul got in trouble with the cops too and he can't collect money, if he goes to jail. I don't know. This movie just didn't give any clue to what would happen to the money. I feel the movie should not have just dumped the ending like that because it brings down the movie story by leaving the viewer with questions.",1350518400,,3895,4.34065934065934
8505234,4,B006VY8CW2,"Tyler Johnston's character deals with the suicide of his friend Barry (Calum Worthy) in the first act, but refuses to believe it, and instead comes to the conclusion he must have won big from the wrong people. Luckily, the chemistry with these characters carries you through the rest of the movie superbly, as it casts notable actors with up-and-coming talent. The great thing about it is once you get attached to a character, or think you have them figured out; you turn out to be completely wrong, which is something I love in a film. Definitely worth taking a chance on.",1333497600,,573,4.683168316831683
8505235,2,B006VY8CW2,"""I think Barry went there last night and I think he won some money."" When Desson (Johnston - who looks just like a young Tom Cruise) finds his best friend Barry hanging by a rope in his garage he is stunned. Desson remembers debts that Barry owed and begins to think that his friend didn't kill himself but was murdered and has a few suspects in mind. He joins in an underground poker game to try and flush out the murderer. This is a movie that had a really good premise and I had pretty high expectations for it. I know it was another B movie but I was actually interested in seeing how they pulled it off. The first half hour was pretty entertaining but then it slowly started to drag and was hard to stay interested in toward the end. The idea and plot is almost nothing like what I expected. The general idea was there but I was expecting something different then what this was. I know it seems like I'm repeating myself but I was really disappointed by this movie. Overall, it was OK but I was expecting more of a thriller mystery I guess. I give it a B-.",1333065600,,1061,4.205882352941177
