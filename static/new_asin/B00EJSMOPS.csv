5923794,5,B00EJSMOPS,"It is cool going back to 1972, and seeing the Dodge Challenger and other cool cars from that era.  I was 9 years old back in 1972, and was cool revisiting that era.  This show changed television forever.  It came at a time when there was a lot of racial unrest in the country and it showed that a black man (Lincoln Hayes) could be friends with a white man (Peter Cochrane) and a white woman (Julie Barnes) I think it had a great deal to change the way people look at the races.  Room 222 also aired during the same era, also changed the hearts and minds of many Americans.

The Mod Squad and Room 222 dealt with real issues, and did not sugar coat life like the Brady Bunch and other shows from that era.

That is why it is still as relevant today, as it was 40 years ago.",1389398400,,773,4.052631578947368
5923795,3,B00EJSMOPS,"On the mod squad set, they do not much with the editing. especially if you compared the volumes that you were initially sold by CBS. They play as well as they are going to. Especially in the opening credits. Also the sound could of be remastered.",1389312000,,246,4.369565217391305
5923796,5,B00EJSMOPS,"This brings back so many memories, this season of the Mod Squad was one of the best, always keeps you in suspense as what will happen next. I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone who was a fan of the Mod Squad.",1389052800,,215,4.023255813953488
5923797,5,B00EJSMOPS,Great TV show when I was a kid. I still enjoy watching it Today !!! A 5 star rating at that !!!,1388448000,,95,3.3636363636363638
5923798,5,B00EJSMOPS,"An under-rated show ... with varied plot-lines and pretty fair acting by the main stars. Could be a bit 'campy' ... and most episodes ended with a rock 'em sock 'em fist fight pitting the good guys Pete & Linc against the bad guys for that week.
I'm pleased that Seasons 3 & 4 have finally been released, and undoubtedly Season 5 wil follow.",1388275200,,341,4.34375
5923799,5,B00EJSMOPS,"Finallly able to purchase. Some old imperfections in quality of episodes, but it just makes me feel like I am watching it on our old console tv again.",1387411200,,150,4.392857142857143
5923800,4,B00EJSMOPS,"The Mod Squad was maybe my favorite TV show when I was in college.  The DVDs are well done, considering the age of the material (40 years, after all).  I gave 4 stars -- I would have given 5 if there were any extras on the discs.  This is true for all of the seasons, by the way.  Since the three principals ( Peggy Lipton, MIchael Cole, and Peggy Lipton) are still alive, how hard would it have been to get interviews or commentaries?

Until this year, I thought The Mod Squad on DVD was going to die with Season 2.  I understand a set of ALL 5 seasons is coming (soon?) but nothing is said about Season 5.  I hope they will release a separate Season 5.  I already had Seasons 1 & 2 when I learned about Seasons 3 & 4 and the Complete Set, so I didn't want to buy the latter and double up on S1 and S2.  I hope I am not stuck without S5.",1386288000,,838,3.8823529411764706

5923802,5,B00EJSMOPS,"I can't say enough about this show. It was cutting edge for it's time,just timeless. Michael,Clarence,Peggy were simply outstanding. They represented what was cool in america at the time. I never missed the show. The actors gelled well together you could see the chemistry.
Aron spelling and Danny Thomas Jr knew what they were doing when they put this show on the air. Ijust loved it!!!",1380931200,3,387,4.878787878787879
