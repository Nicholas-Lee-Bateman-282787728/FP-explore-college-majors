The network ceased broadcasting in 2006 and was the predecessor to The CW. The final series to debut on The WB was a wonderful, light hearted comedy-drama called Pepper Dennis.

From the very first episode I fell in love with all the characters and became hooked on watching their wild and sometimes zany adventures.

Rebecca Romijn (Mystique in the original X-Men trilogy and Eve in The Librarians) stars as Pepper Dennis, a feisty, independent TV reporter with dreams of becoming a news anchor. Josh Hopkins (Ally McBeal, Cougar Town) stars as Charlie Babcock, an often egocentric scoundrel and TV news anchor. Other stars include Rider Strong, Brooke Burns and Lindsay Price.

TV classics such as Remington Steele and Moonlighting built up viewer anticipation by teasing the question of whether or not there would be a meaningful romance between the main characters (Remington and Laura / David and Maddie). I was immediately reminded of those famous TV relationships when watching the  interplay between Pepper and Charlie. Strangely enough, actor James Read(from Remington Steele) appears in Pepper Dennis as Wes Brinkman. A nice surprise!

Unfortunately there are only 13 episodes of Pepper Dennis. When The WB ceased operations they chose not to transition the series over to The CW.

Thankfully the final episode offers partial resolution for some plot elements, but this series ended far too soon. There was so much more life in all of the characters, especially Pepper and Charlie.

I loved this series. It should definitely be released on DVD or at least available for streaming/on demand.

Note: This Amazon product listing is for a special promotional DVD that contained the pilot and episode 1. The full series has never officially been released.",1499904000,2,1888,5.147058823529412
