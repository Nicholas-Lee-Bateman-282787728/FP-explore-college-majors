Rathbone plays a great Holmes but I think Jeremy Brett actually plays him more true to Doyle's characterisation. I still like to watch Basil do it though.
This one is in my library to stay. Thank God someone saved these  before they really got bad.",1011657600,2,465,4.284090909090909
7946416,4,B00005N5RW,"Legendary Sherlock Holmes

In the 1940's Hollywood produced fourteen movies that featured Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. The first two, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, were set in the late 19th century. The next twelve movies were set in modern times and supported the Allied war effort. The copyrights expired on four of these movies. Each movie is on one DVD, unlike some other collections. For more details read the individual reviews for each movie. The best movies are based on the original stories.

Sherlock Holmes Dressed To Kill (1946) tells about the theft of music boxes. What is so important about these items? Do they contain a valuable secret? Holmes solved the crimes and the secret.

Sherlock Holmes The Woman in Green (1945) tells about the murders of women by a serial killer. Holmes solved the crimes.

Sherlock Holmes Terror By Night (1946) tells about a murder and the theft of a valuable diamond. Holmes solved the first and recovers the second.",1470009600,,1044,4.9147727272727275
7946417,5,B00005N5RW,I really enjoy this video.  It is exciting.  The sound quality is not the greatest but the picture quality is fine. Dressed To Kill / The Woman In Green are great movies.  I just started watching some of Terror By Night and it looks so good so far.,1191110400,,248,4.125
7946418,4,B00005N5RW,"This DVD brings back these three movies exactly as I remember them.  I was not yet born when these movies debuted on the silver screen, however...my memories of these movies is from when I was a child, watching them on late-night television with my grandmother.  Since then, I have been a fan of Basil Rathbone and enjoy his rendition of the infamous resident of 221B Baker Street.  These movies are original material (as opposed to, say, The Hound of Baskervilles which is adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writings) but still capture the epitome of Sherlock Holmes.
The quality of the reproduction certainly is not perfect.  However, if you remember watching these movies on television as I do, then you will be familiar with the quality of the film.  The sound is a little scratchy, and the picture is a little grainy, but the movies are viewable and very much enjoyable.  If you remember these movies, you will not be disappointed by this DVD.  If, however, you are looking for adaptations of original Conan Doyle material, you may wish to look to the Jeremy Brett renditions.",1022716800,28,1084,4.795698924731183
7946419,4,B00005N5RW,"Many people, especially those who grew up during the 1930s and 1940s, have fond memories of Basil Rathbone's famous Sherlock Holmes series.  My own exposure to the popular series came in the 1970s, when I encountered them on the late-late show; ""The Scarlet Claw"" was a particular favorite.  Unfortunately, few of these films have ever been released to the home market in either VHS or DVD, and those that have reflect their need for serious restoration.  This is particularly true of the films seen here. Although not unbearably fuzzy, the pictures are far from being crisp and clean, and the sound is occasionally problematic.
DRESSED TO KILL finds Holmes investigating three mysterious music boxes--and events quickly turn to murder.  Of the three films, this is the weakest: the story is very slow to start and it never really achieves a good pace; the sound quality is also very, very poor in spots.  THE LADY IN GREEN concerns Holmes' investigation into several murders that seem to be the work of a serial killer, and although the film elements remain problematic this film is quite a bit more enjoyable than the first.  The third and final film, TERROR BY NIGHT, is easily the best of the three in both story and elements, setting a cracking pace with its story of murder and a diamond theft onboard an Edinburg-bound train.
Film restoration issues aside, Rathbone's Holmes has held up extremely well over time.  As interpreted here, Holmes is sometimes as much action hero as he is thinking machine, and Rathbone plays him with a snappy clip, dry humor, and enough intensity to suggest untold depths.  He is well matched by Nigel Bruce, whose truly dunderheaded Dr. Watson nonetheless has considerable wit and charm.  The stories and scripts are pure formula, of course, and the supporting casts and production values quite mild--but Rathbone and Bruce's performances and chemistry have more than enough charm to gloss over these inadequacies.  Not every one will enjoy these films, for they have a naive quality that many may consider unsophistocated to the point of absurdity, but fans of the series would rather fight than switch.  Just bear in mind the quality issues, don't expect too much, and you'll have a very good time.",1017100800,24,2238,4.941333333333334
7946420,5,B00005N5RW,"I adore every one of the old Holmes/Watson films with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. I thought they were perfect for the parts, and Nigel Bruce was just an endearing Watson. If you are into the Master, and don't take yourself too seriously, these are fun to watch. I only wish that there were more of them for us to enjoy. On the down side, do not expect great quality from these films because it isn't there. Sadly, these are falling apart, so there may not be any more of them in the future, unless someone makes an investment, and restores them. Even though they are only ""acceptable"" visually, these are wonderful slices of cinematic entertainment. Rathbone's arch, tongue in cheek Holmes, and Bruce's endearing, bumbling, and smug Watson are too good to pass up. I watched these as a child, and so for me, there are no other actors who could come close to these guys. Watching Watson bumble around, gives you an understanding of what an upper class twit is, and how they lost the empire!",1015804800,4,993,4.584269662921348
7946421,3,B00005N5RW,"Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Holmes, while less mercurial and intense than Jeremy Brett's, has stood up well over the years.  Unfortunately, Nigel Bruce's characterization of Watson as a lovable dolt has not. Also, the production values are far below the earlier ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" not to mention those of the modern BBC productions.  Nevertheless, I found these fun to watch.
My favorites in this set are ""Dressed to Kill"" and ""The Woman in Green"". Both are original stories that transpose the Holmes and Watson characters to the 20th century. In each, Holmes matches wits with a wily femme fatale, as in ""A Scandal in Bohemia"".
The DVD transfer is acceptable, but well below the quality one might hope for.",1015545600,8,758,5.007936507936508
7946422,1,B00005N5RW,"The quality of the reproduction on this DVD is appalling and I've had to return this disc as it is unwatchable! Your other reviewers seem to think that the low price more than compensates for the lack of quality!? This disc is an insult to three 'classic' films!
This disc is really very poor and it's cost me a lot of good money in returning it!",1014681600,9,346,4.257575757575758
7946423,5,B00005N5RW,"The price / quality ratio is here perfectly balanced. The pic / sound quality is definitely not very good, but then, I have never seen any of the Rathbone's Holmes series in any sharper image;...
By the way, if you are not familiar, the films themselves are quite stupid, with little bearing to the literary Holmes. Still, they are quite moody as such.",1012176000,,352,4.603174603174603
7946424,5,B00005N5RW,"A train is speeding from London to Scotland, a murderer is on board, and someone has just stolen famous the Star of Rhodesia. A bizarre series of murders, a secret society of hypnotists, and professor Moriarty is the prime suspectsuspect.  Musical boxes containg hidden codes, their owners turning up dead, and the prime suspect is already behind bars.  The plots are fantastic, the villians so colorful, the chemistry so perfect . . . the deduction so inevitable -- it could only be Holmes and Watson as portrayed by the incomparable Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.  These are three of the better known entries in the series of fourteen films Rathbone and Bruce made together.  The prints are good, the sound clear, and the DVD quality is a slight improvement over the VHS versions.  The bonus material on this DVD isn't as extensive as any fan of the series will hope for -- There is scene access -- bios of the stars and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - Selected filmographies -- a few background stills -- original poster art is reproduced on the package, and some interesting trivia is included.  Still, it's a treat having these films on DVD, and lets hope the rest of their classic films make it onto this format.",1011916800,4,1212,4.693396226415095
