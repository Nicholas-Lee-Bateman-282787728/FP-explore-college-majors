8299871,4,B001EXWAMI,"This is a propaganda video with two primary goals. The first (1) goal is to make the American government look human and considerate while putting many of its own citizens into internment camps. The second (2) goal is to influence how Americans captured overseas by the enemy might be treated, based on how America treats those they see as potential enemies.

It's highly unlikely those put into interment camps against their will, did so cheerfully, as the video implies. Many of the Japanese interned were American citizens that knew their constitutional rights were being violated. However, based on how all sides treated those they saw as the enemy, potential enemy or undesirable, the treatment of Japanese people in America was humane, and far from the treatment of those during the Nanking Massacre or those forcefully put into the German Internment/Extermination camps.

Some might say ""What about Hiroshima and Nagasaki?"" My reply would be ""During WWII, if the Japanese or Germans had a read-to-go nuclear bomb, without hesitation, they surely would have used it.""

War is never politically correct. The best we can hope for is that those most considerate of the rights of others win, which is what happened with World War II.",1438992000,,1234,5.068965517241379
8299872,5,B001EXWAMI,"The ""editorial review"" up above is just plain factually wrong.  Of the ADULTS, more than half were NOT U.S. citizens, which creates a problem in a war zone.  They were ""enemy aliens"" and every nation on the planet has always segregated those in times of war.  About 50,000 did not speak English.  Many thousands refused to sign a loyalty oath, or renounce allegiance to the emporer.  Several thousands of the Japanese-Americans renounced their U.S. citizenship (and were returned to Japan at the end of the war).

It was to their advantage and their own safety to be removed from a potential (and expected) combat zone.  There had already been at least two murders of ethnic Japanese in California in December 1941.  There had been a major spy ring bust just the prior summer in 1941, which included both non-citizens (aliens) and Japanese -American citizen members.  The Niihau Incident itself, at Pearl Harbor, gives proof that loyalty and disloyalty were unknown.  FBI Director Hoover is on record stating that he did not have the resources to investigate 112,000 people along the U.S. west coast, one by one under the emergency war-time conditions.

At the time, FDR could not disclose that the MAGIC intelligence intercepts went into his decision for Executive Order 9066, which did not even mention the word ""Japanese,"" but gave the Western Defense Zone commander the authority to ""exclude"" and remove anyone he deemed necessary.  We now have a more complete picture of the network of Japanese espionage on the west coast.  The book by David Lowman, _MAGIC: The Untold Story_ is highly recommended.

The constitutionality of the emergency, war-time decision was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.  The entire legal position is well documented in the War Relocation Authority (WRA)'s own final reports published in 1946.",1390089600,,1824,5.073825503355705
