2200157,4,B000742G0G,"I am really sick of the many negative reviews this documentary has been given. In case you didn't know The History Channel is a channel that makes it's shows for the GENERAL AUDIENCE. It is not a channel made for historians only. I love history, and I love studying it. Yes, the show was a bit short and I do not like the fact that they didn't talk much about the war on the frontier (especially how they only briefly mentioned the capture of Fort Mackinac in Michigan.) But for god's sake! If they made this show into an 8 hour long historian's dissertation they would first run out of money, and two only attract historians. I think that shows like these are supposed to be used as staring points in terms of getting into history. So, I recommend this show for new history buffs, new  amateur historians, the general public, and grade school and high school classrooms.",1151280000,25,871,4.512658227848101
2200158,5,B000742G0G,"I purchased this to view with my students while discussing the War of 1812.  It did a fantastic job of laying out the second war with Britain and its implications.  The students were able to listen to noted historians on the subject, and view ""film footage"" created to re-enact the various major moments of the war.

The film did an admirable job of laying out the blunders and lack of good judgement that was often associated with this particular war.  It also brought into its story the creation of the poem ""The Battle of Fort McHenry"" written by young lawyer (Francis Scott Key) that would later become our national anthem, and the unforgetable battle of New Orleans that made Andrew Jackson an icon and helped to push our country into the ""Era of Good Feelings"".

Well written and interesting.  There were a few ""dry spots"" but they did not last over long.  Great for someone who is studying this particular aspect of American History.",1142035200,62,940,4.695121951219512
2200159,2,B000742G0G,"Neither side in the 1812-1815 war emerged victorious, although you might think one side did from watching this documentary.  The US came close to defeat several times and it was only the occasional victory (Fort McHenry) that saved the US. Had the US navy not secured victories in the northern lakes, then the US army would have been in serious trouble.

With Napoleon defeated, Great Britain started to transfer large amounts of ships and experienced troops to America. There was no opposing great power like France, Spain or Holland to come to it's aid this time. Had the war not ended, then there is every chance the United States would have gone bankrupt and lost some of the states. New England was close to breaking away.

The Treaty of Ghent ended the war but resolved none of the issues that started it. This documentary is interesting for some of the details, but the overall slant is biased and could have provided so much more details.

Not sure why Ironclads are on the dvd since all ships were still made of wood in 1815.",1128038400,20,1034,4.633879781420765
2200160,2,B000742G0G,"I've studied this war a bit and read some interesting books on the topic by some of the top historians, and I have to say that the producers of this film did not try very hard to fit in some key details in the time slot they alloted for this documentary.  Many key events were completely ignored in favor of a popular view of history.  It does not address the notion of the United States' overpowering desire to sieze Canada, nor of the intense unpopularity of the war in New England.  Could have been done a lot better, as were many of the earlier documentaries done by The History Channel when it first premiered (check out The American Revolution - quite excellent!).",1120780800,31,670,4.475409836065574
2200161,1,B000742G0G,"Like Nick (London UK), I too learnt a different version of this history. It appears to me that one should question everything that is produced by the History Channel if this is the type of drivel that they put out. Face it Vietnam wasn't the first war the US lost. This program is pure US propaganda and is far from true history. I guess this will upset some, but lets face it ""The first casualty of war is the truth"".",1119052800,22,418,4.2375
2200162,3,B000742G0G,"I had hoped, before I got a look at the contents listed on the back of the box, that this might be a miniseries, similar perhaps to the History Channel's ""Founding Fathers,"" dealing with this all-too-often forgotten conflict.  What you get instead is a single program about the war, plus several ancillary items going into (slightly) greater depth on specific aspects of the conflict.  (There's also one program that has no business at all in this set, but more on that in a moment.)

The centerpiece of this set is ""First Invasion: The War of 1812,"" an engaging overview (running roughly 80 minutes) of the entire history of the war.  It's a typical History Channel affair: brisk narration, interesting input from a handful of scholarly talking heads, the customary ""reenactments,"" and so on.  (Unfortunately, the reenactments feature a comically inappropriate James Madison: in place of the small, thin, withdrawn Madison of history, we get a robust, portly young man with his hair dyed grey.  Nobody watches these shows for the actors, naturally, but this poor fellow was so flagrantly miscast that I found it a little distracting.)  The content of TV programs of this sort is nearly always very watered down, but this one is relatively informative.  The account of the defense of Fort McHenry -- which inspired Francis Scott Key to pen the words to our national anthem -- is very effective and actually rather moving.

The set also contains an hour-long program on the Battle of New Orleans, which despite its length doesn't really add too much to the coverage of this remarkable engagement offered in ""First Invasion."" In addition, there's a very good episode of ""Biography"" covering the life of that battle's hero, Andrew Jackson, from which the controversial president emerges as a complex and fascinating figure, and unquestionably (whether you love or hate him) a great American.  There's also an OK program about ""The Star Spangled Banner"" -- meaning the poem written by F.S. Key, the song to which his words were set, and the actual flag, flown over Fort McHenry, that inspired those words in the first place. There's a recap of the events that led up to the composition (again adding fairly little to the presentation given in ""First Invasion""), a history of the poem from then until it became our official national anthem during the Hoover administration, and a parallel history of the flag itself, including recent efforts to prevent its deterioration.  Competently done, but these topics didn't hold as much interest (for me anyway) as most of the other items in the set.

Roger Daltrey is on hand for an episode of ""Extreme History"" describing life on an 1812 battleship.  This is entertaining enough (thanks mainly to some surprisingly off-color humor from Mr Daltrey), if pretty light on actual information.

Finally (and bizarrely), the set includes an episode of ""The Great Ships"" entitled ""The Ironclads,"" which the box calls ""a revealing look at the battleships put to sea in the War of 1812.""  Actually, the War of 1812 is never so much as mentioned: this program deals with the bizarre iron-clad warships used during the American Civil War, some fifty years later!  It's actually quite an interesting program, but what on earth is it doing in a collection dealing with the War of 1812?  The only thing I can figure is that somebody confused ""ironclad"" with the 1812-era nickname given to the U.S.S. Constitution: Old Ironsides.  This is a pretty embarrassing mistake, though, if you call yourself ""The History Channel.""

The set is pretty good as far as it goes.  But it would be nice if somebody would put together a good three-or four-hour miniseries about this very interesting, and ultimately crucial, period in American history.",1118793600,127,3757,4.990384615384615
2200163,4,B000742G0G,"The main 1 1/2 Hour documentary about the War of 1812 was informative, entertaining and well done.  I also enjoyed the biography episode about Andrew Jackson that was included.  Although I have no particular criticism of the documentary about the Ironclads, I am puzzled about what it is doing in this DVD set about the War of 1812 since it talks mostly about the Civil War era.  More frustrating is the fact that the specifications make you think you are getting more documentary than you really are.  The Battle of New Orleans and the Star Spangled Banner are both covered in good detail in the main documentary only to have the footage reused and repackaged as two additional seperate documentaries on these topics. Survining an 1812 Battleship, at a paultry 20 minutes, spends a good portion of its time letting the host make bad or profane jokes.

Would I still have purchased the DVD set?  Maybe, but I might have waited for a used copy at a lower price if I had known how much repetition of footage there was.",1110844800,45,1016,4.616666666666666
2200164,3,B000742G0G,"I live in the Lewiston/Queenston area, one of the battle sites of this war. There are numerous plaques and statues dedicated to this war on both sides. The people living around this area on the US side have no delusions about what happened. I am a Canadian living in the US and although the History Channel may produce this type of patriotic history drivel the locals aren't buying it, I have had some humorous banter with americans about them losing this war to Canada. I just wanted to set the record straight that just because HC makes it doesn't mean thats the opinion of americans, HC makes historical entertainment shows based on demographics and board room meetings. I will still watch there shows because they are entertaining but dig deeper for the real history.",1110412800,9,771,4.7611940298507465
2200165,5,B000742G0G,"As an American history buff, I thought I knew enough about the War of 1812, but after watching ""First Invasion: The War of 1812"" on the History Channel, I found out I didn't know nearly as much as I should. The War of 1812 was a very pivotal moment in this country's history, and this DVD does the most amazing job of presenting the war as just that: a pivotal moment, not a ""footnote"" as it is so often presented in many history books. It never really dawned on me just how big a victory the Battle of New Orleans was for the United States; a rather ""ragtag"" group of American soldiers soundly defeated the greatest army in the world, the same army which had just defeated Napoleon! It's no wonder Andrew Jackson became such a larger-than-life figure to so many Americans after that battle. The DVD contains not just the excellent History Channel documentary, but several other programs related to the War of 1812. I especially enjoyed the episode of ""Extreme History"" with Roger Daltrey and the biography of Andrew Jackson. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves American history!",1109980800,12,1091,4.658031088082901
2200166,2,B000742G0G,"Well in the UK we were taught that the US LOST the war of 1812, so it is interesting to see it being given the star bangled banner treatment.

We were taught that the Americans got their **** whupped after invading Canada in a nakedly hostile act of conquest. Oh I know the programme rehashes some rather spurious pretexts but no one believed them then or should now. In any case, the truth is US forces were chased back across the border and got their capitol burned to the ground as a result. Now THERE'S a useful history lesson...

2200186,5,B000742G0G,Needed to augment my library for the War of 1812 and this fit the bill. Easily understandable by middle schoolers.,1357603200,3,114,4.75
2200197,5,B000742G0G,"This 2-disc set is one of the better History Channel efforts: it takes a large subject and makes it clear and accessible to a broad audience -  from high school students on up.  The first episode of Disk 1 - ""First Invasion"" - is the core of the program.  Actors in period costumes plus snappy computer graphics bring dramatic events to life:  the British impressment of U.S. merchant sailors, disaster at Bladensburg, the attack on Washington and the burning of both the Capitol Building and the White House, the heroics of Dolly Madison, the Sandy-like storm that doused the flames and hindered the British, the assault on Baltimore and the shelling of Fort McHenry.  While there's plenty of action and colorful characters, talking heads provide good analysis of American and British motives and personalities.  A few names: Anthony S. Pitch, Libby O'Connell and Ralph Ketchum.  They are worth following-up and reading, for serious students (I'll admit that I'm not an 1812 buff).

Subsequent episodes are well-done but not as essential as the first: the saga of Francis Scott Key and the Star Spangled Banner, behind the scenes interviews with actors and producers, a good summary of the Battle of New Orleans, a short bio of Andrew Jackson, a look at the hard life of naval seamen and a somewhat off-topic extra on ironclad ships of the Civil War.

I won't give a blow-by-blow account of the war or the program (you can watch it).  However, I noticed a few similarities between 1812 and more recent times:

  1)  Rich men plan and command, poor men fight and die.  This is not a very original observation but the producers deserve credit for mentioning that most U.S. militia soldiers were poor, malnourished and without access to medical care.  The same can be said for most of the British combatants.  While today's all-volunteer military hails mostly from the middle class and enjoys many middle class comforts, this is a very recent development.

  2) The Fog of War: When Madison declared war, the British had already discontinued impressment on the high seas (the news hadn't reached him - no fault of his).  At the finish, as the British made their way to New Orleans and the endgame with Andrew Jackson, the approximate terms of the Treaty of Ghent had already been reached (again, the news had not travelled).  The result really was an endgame, too: a crushing defeat for the British, a soaring victory for Jackson and the rebirth of a new, self-assured USA.  Most of us like to think that war is no longer so foggy in our high-tech age - but that hasn't been the case in Libya.  Congressional committees and conspiracy theorists will get plenty of mileage out of Benghazi for the next 4 years.

  3) There is confidence and there is over-confidence.  The Americans assumed that Canada would be a pushover.  In burning York, the capitol of Upper Canada, they didn't pause to think that the enemy might exact revenge in kind.  Likewise, the British assumed their various attacks, both ground and naval, would be walkovers.  Their army was the biggest and the best trained in the world; they were fresh off their defeat of Napoleon.  They were up against -  well, a grab bag of local militias - hardly a real army, in their opinion.  The next 200 years would provide many examples of homegrown militias defeating large armies with superior weaponry (as in Libya a year ago and in Syria right now).

  4) It sure pays to have friends because you never know when you might need them.  Exactly 100 years after they took food and liquor from Madison's pantry, ate at his dining room table and then burned his White House, the British were back -  hat in hand, pleading for U.S. assistance in their war with Imperial Germany.  They got it -  first money from the Morgan Bank, then troops in 1917.

So go ahead and watch this series for a refresher on the War of 1812.  You'll learn something about the conflicts of 200 years ago and you'll get insights into the conflicts of our time, in the bargain.",1353628800,4,4006,4.72005772005772

2200199,2,B000742G0G,"The War of 1812 is usually the most forgotten war in the History of America's Wars (if not the Korean or Spanish-American). But this documentary does a horrible job of potraying the whole war. It give's the potrayal that we Americans are too afraid of the truth of our history, which seems to have happen with this video. The U.S. declared war on British North America/Canada (as Great Britian was too busy with a much more important war with Napoleon), but they didn't talk much of America's failed attempts of Canada that lasted in 1812-1813, and little of the western battles (at that time it wasn't pass the Mississippi). They also didn't mention anything about Tecumseh, William H. Harrison, Winfield Scott, and almost nothing of the Indian's significance in the war. Excluding the burning of York and it's 'revenge' it fueled for the British, it said nothing of the battlefront in Canada. They went straight to the Burning of Washington, which was use by the History Channel as a 'turning point' in the war. It was, but not hardly. Two major victories shadowing the previous and horrible blunders that preceeded the two mentioned here makes it appear that America won the war, when at best for America it was a stalemate (my opinion, they lost). It even truthfully wasn't about a ""Reconquering of the Colonies"" for the British as they mentioned on the documentary, but more about impressment, expansion, trade, among other factors. Worst of all, they didn't mention anything of the fate of true losers in the war: The American Indians. This supposedly full coverage of the war some people may be led to believe that America triumphed over the British Menace with two victories, which is a lie. I could get over the bad potrayals of some of the main people they did mention (The Madison's in particular; a bad choice for James even moreso), but telling the commmon US citizen lies and trying to give morale boosters to the general public that America will always prevail as some form of propoganda is something I can't stand for.

I do appreciate that they give some sort of an extensive detail of Battles of Baltimore/New Orleans, but people do not need to make the mistake/assumption that this is a great overview of this war, because it is certainly not that. In order to have a good documentary, you need to cover the bad and good with the War of 1812 in America's perspective, and the History Channel did a horrbile job with the former. And anybody who thinks this is a good documentary obviously doesn't know what they're talking about. People, do yourself a favor and view the PBS version, or Canadian 4 part series of this war, and do some reading. Do not base your view of the war off of this documentary alone, if at all.",1323129600,8,2736,4.711899791231732

2200201,1,B000742G0G,"Americans have taken their war of aggrandisement and attempted conquest of British North America and transformed it into one of defending the republic. Although this DVD is 'heritage history'(designed to make Americans feel good about themselves) you'd probably have to go to North Korea to find similar levels of blatant nationalistic propaganda.

There are various alleged reasons for the USA declaring war on Britain and annexing Canada, but that which is incontestable was that US ships were stopped and searched by the Royal Navy for British nationals.  According to the 'Naturalization Act' of 1802 US citizenship was based on five years residence probationary period, but money-making scams operated by US notaries, US consuls and US customs officers abounded - where ""proof"" of naturalisation could be bought at the right price and issued to anyone - no oath required and no questions asked. Why wasn't this mentioned in the film?

Impressment was never sufficient cause for war. The main avowed reason for war were the Orders In Council of 1807 which affected the trade of neutrals. The British government, in deference to protest on both sides of the Atlantic, repealed the Orders of Council on the 16th of  June 1812, two days before America's declaration of war.

But of course maritime issues alone were not sufficient for the declaration of war. With 12th Congress came a new breed of men, ambitious for territorial expansion - not only in the Floridas - but British N.A, taking cynical advantage of Britain's plight.

Evidence from sessions of 12th Congress, The Legislature of Massachusetts (June 1813), Article XI of the USA Articles of Confederation, territorial ambitions elsewhere and the notorious Proclamations demonstrate that absorption of Canada was the real goal of the United States in 1812.

""We shall drive the British from our continent. I therefore feel anxious not only to add the Floridas to the South, but the Canadas to the North of this empire.""
Felix Grundy, Speech, in Annals of Congress, 12th Cong., 1st Sess.

The torching of certain buildings in Washington in 1814 by British troops was a direct reprisal for the destruction of modern-day Toronto (York) by American troops the previous year. One does not hear, however, of atrocities being committed in Washington as in Toronto - no brutalising of POWs or uncontrolled looting and arson - or raping and scalping and murder as was committed against Indians in Upper Canada. Port Dover, Port Talbot, Turkey Point and Long Point all suffered fearfully through arson looting and murder.  Of course, none of the American barbarities committed in Canada are mentioned in this film.

When British reinforcements finally arrived after the first defeat of Napoleon in 1814  75% of all troops were stationed in Upper Canada to protect it from US aggression. That was the first priority of the British, and British troop movements and numbers are all very well documented. Hoary old American myth, by contrast, tells that all the beastly British troops were engaged in 'conquering' the USA and taking away her independence. As well as her standing army the USA could also draw on 450,000 militiamen. Britain had only 10,847 troops on US soil in December 1814, so the notion expressed in this film is patently absurd.

And what was the result of this unwarranted American aggression? Five times the US invaded Canada and five times repulsed, ports blockaded, trade wrecked, a US national debt of $147 million, the capitol city burned, planned secession of New England and capitulation of Maine.  Over a million acres of US territory was occupied by British forces in March 1815 and the US was unable to even mint pennies that year because they had no copper. Since the Capitol lay in blackened ruins, Congress convened at Blodgett's Hotel in Washington.

America's casus belli were not even mentioned in the Peace Treaty. The Orders In Council of 1807 were repeated by the Orders In Council of 1915, this time prohibiting US trade with Germany.  The howls of protest were likewise repeated. All that was missing was the refrain ""onwards to Canada"".

Small wonder Americans try and save face with films like this. Foremost authority on the War of 1812, Donald Hickey, concludes that:

""But the United States failed to conquer Canada, and the maritime issues were not even mentioned in the peace treaty.  By any reasonable measure, Republican war policy was a failure, and the United States actually lost the war-even if it has never acknowledged the fact.""

2200202,1,B000742G0G,"Utterly biased revisionist history, is the only way to describe this DVD.

The War of 1812 was a misunderstood, mismanaged war on many levels, but to portray the war as a massive, almost overwhelming victory for the United States (as this program does) is nothing short of diabolical.

It should be renamed ""1814 - 1815 and what happened during these years"" because what you get is certainly not the War of 1812. The show briefly glosses over both the issues leading to the war and the actual first two years of the fighting (in which the single most important battles, and those with the longest lasting legacy, take place). There is also no mention of the Native American leader Tecumseh, one of the most enduring characters from this period of history and whose Native American coalition was a main factor of the war. This is presumably because it would alter the US perception of the war from one of defence to one of aggression, nonewithstanding the horrific treatment Tecumseh's body endured by American troops after his death.

Instead it rushes itself in order to get to the battles that took place on American soil. With little to no mention what so ever of the multiple US invasions of British North America (Canada) in which the British were vastly outnumbered but managed to consistently defeat the invaders over the course of two years. These victories creating a sense of national pride which would eventually result in actual nationhood for Canada in 1867.

It also wrongly implies that Britain attempted to retake the lost American Colonies during this war, which is absolutely ridiculous. To Britain this war was nothing but a sideshow to the war with Napoleon in Europe, and the British ""Invasions"" were in actual fact large scale raids, designed to force the United States to make peace.

The Burning of Washington is shown more or less to be an evil, unjustified act. In actual fact, the burning of Washington was in retaliation for the conduct of US troops burning and looting the City of York after their victory. It was essentially an act of savagery in an age where warfare was the sport of gentlemen. In contrast during the buring of Washington British skill and discipline resulted in only public buildings such as the White House being burnt, while civilian property was untouched.

The show finishes on the Battle of New Orleans, which is shown to be a sort of decisive, final victory against the British invaders. Nonewithstanding the fact that two more battles took place after New Orleans and both of which were British victories, ridiculously biased stuff.

""The Battle of New Orleans"" is another piece, and it adds some depth to the treatment of the battle in first invasion, but not so much as to make the New Orleans offering a necessary component of the package. There is also an in-depth look at Andrew Jackson, part of the History Channel's ""Biography"" series, an episode of ""Extreme History"" featuring Roger Daltrey about life aboard the U.S. brig Niagara, a feature on the Star Spangled Banner--Keys'poem and the flag that inspired it, and an inexplicably-included feature on the ironclads of the Civil War--the latter inclusion clearly a mistake by someone.

""First Invasion"" is an OK overview, one I have used in an American History class on American Wars, but it has some flaws.  It glosses over the pan-tribal coalition put together by the great Shawnee leader Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa, ""The Prophet.""  In general, ""First Invasion"" treats the Native American presence more as a barrier to U.S. expansion than as a subject to be treated fairly or completely on its own terms.  In fact, while the title refers to the British invasion of the U.S., the actual first invasion of the War of 1812 was the General William Hull-led U.S. invasion of Canada that was summarily rebuffed by a British/Canadian force under General Isaac Brock.  When Brock's force followed the retreating Hull back to Detroit, Hull ignominiously surrendered the garrison without a shot being fired.  Nothing of this shameful episode makes it into ""First Invasion""; nor does Hull's subsequent court martial (which resulted in a death sentence, promptly commuted).  In fact, the pivotal naval Battle of Lake Erie (1813) which arguably saved Ohio and the rest of the then-west from British invasion (and gave us Oliver Hazard Perry's laconic report of the battle, ""we have met the enemy and they are ours""), and the subsequent Battle of the Thames, in which the great Tecumseh was killed are also skipped over.  After a pretty thorough treatment of the causes of the war, and a brief mention of certain war-related events of the opening year of combat(The U.S.S. Constutution's earning its memorable nickmame ""Old Ironsides"" is mentioned), the presentaion skips directly to 1814, and the bulk of the rest of the dvd concentrates on three topics: the campaign that resulted in the burning of Washington D.C.; the British naval campaign against Baltimore, foiled by the Battle of Fort McHenry; and the Battle of New Orleans.  The treatment of these episodes is pretty thorough, but overall ""First Invasion"" omits too much to be a really useful overview of the war.  By comparison, ""First Invasion"" suffers badly when contrasted with the History Channel's very balanced look at that other long-neglected war of the early Republic, the Mexican-American War, which is, by-the-way, outstanding.

Because of the flaws of the overview program ""First Invasion,"" the entire package isn't necessarily all that compelling.  The program on the flag is interesting, the biography on Jackson thorough, and the Extreme History piece about Perry's flagship is a bit of relative fluff.  I was able to use the ironlads program in my American Wars class during our look at the Civil War; otherwise it is a useless part of a consideration of the War of 1812.

For these reasons, I rated the entire set with three stars.  I've used it--dvd chapters here and there--in my classes, but don't view this and think you've seen anything approaching a definitive account about the War of 1812.  However, in lieu of anything better on the market (as far as I'm aware of), I would give it a cautious recommendation.",1297555200,4,3901,5.031055900621118

2200206,4,B000742G0G,"This is a very good production and a compelling visual story of the events of the War of 1812.  However, I don't understand how the History Channel does not mention the Battle of Plattsburgh, NY and the U.S. Navy victory on Lake Champlain which took place on September 11, 1814.  This event foiled Britain's attempt to seal off New England from the rest of the states and was a significant issue leading to the Treaty of Ghent. It was possibly the most important victory of the war yet it unfortunately can not compete with the more glamorous defense of Fort McHenry or the heroics of Andy Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans.",1283385600,,627,4.539823008849558
2200207,3,B000742G0G,"Being a student of history as well as having a BA in history I think this was a good attempt at trying to introduce the war of 1812.  It is not a perfect documentary and at time does use a broad stroke and skips over other details and events.  It is also at times tends to over state and repeat itself.  However this is a tendency of most History Channel documentaries. Since it is a very unknown war compared to the Revolutionary War and Civil war it would be hard to create a very in depth documentary considering the target audience of most History Channel viewers.
  Despite this it is a good introduction to viewers about a forgotten or little heard about war in American History.  It tries to reaffirm the idea that this was the second war of Independence for the United States.  It captures and tries to portray the image of a new nation trying to find its place and confidence.  Despite the burning of its capital and facing the world's most elite army it does manage to survive.  Wars are not won by who wins battles but by the perception of who left standing at the end.  Though the almost unmentioned failure of the Canadian invasion and the burning of the Washington American's managed to hold of the might of the British Empire.
  Back across the Atlantic public opinion and political opinion had turned against the war for various reason.  The added set backs at Baltimore and other places helped aid this turn in opinion adding to the British seeking terms which the United States were also eager for.  The battle of New Orleans, though fought unknowingly by the combatants, added to many American's a sense that they had emerged victorious.  Had no treaty been signed the victory at New Orleans would most likely had resulted in a peace treaty anyways.  They could have brought in a more deeper treatment of the wearing affects of the war on both sides.
  The critiques about who won or lost the war is not all fair.  The invasion of Canada was doomed before the first shot was fired.  It was ill planned and logistically almost impossible to attempt. Any chance to take Canada was lost in the Revolutionary war.  That venture to seize Canada should have taught the Americans how difficult and endeavor it would be.  During the American revolution Philadelphia, the capital, was also capture yet the rebellion went on.  The burning and capturing of Washington can't not be viewed as winning the war though humiliating it might be.  What it did do was a mistake that they would not repeat at Baltimore and helped show the strength of the American character.
  I would recommend this documentary for any new students to history as well as an introduction to the war of 1812.  Like any student of history though it is always a good thing to read and view material from all different perspectives.  This documentary was told from an American History point of view so yes it does have a point of view bias, but almost any book or documentary does.",1278201600,,2958,4.604206500956023
2200208,1,B000742G0G,"Are American egos so fragile that they need this form of revisionist history to bolster themselves? I watched this spurious load of drivel after viewing the Canadian production on the same subject, which was historically more accurate.

At least the Canadian production referred to Tecumseh, Brock and Perry, and tried to understand the underlying reasons for the conflict beyond ""we wuz invaded and that ain't right"". It also examined the problems faced by the native First Nations in dealing with the continual bad treatment and broken treaties with the American government. No mention is made in the History Channel production of this problem, nor of the root cause of naked American aggression - so-called ""manifest destiny"", other than to claim that the War of 1812 established Anerica's ""right"" to manifest destiny, the right to treat the continent of North America as their own, handed to them by their god, and theirs to do with as they will.

All the talking heads (I hesitate to call them historians) speak of the glory of the US fight and its victory over the invaders, conveniently forgetting the battles that the US army lost - battles that were glossed over by this program, and that the US was the initial aggressor by invading Canada. They speak of the US greatness, of its coming-of-age, its establishment of nationhood and identity, and its recognition of ownership over the continent.

After watching this DVD, I came to an understanding of how these conclusions could have been reached. Americans need to proclaim everything they do as the best, the greatest, the most powerful. They must proclaim themselves the leaders of the world, trumpet their achievements, wave their flag at every opportunity. They have to call their baseball season, in which no other nation takes part, the ""World Series"". Their fragile egos just cannot deal with the fear of their own mediocrity. And no amount of chest-beating, chanting of ""USA USA USA"", or tub-thumping about their right to pre-eminence is going to cover the fact that America as a nation is, at its core, terrified.

But to claim this war as a victory, to see it as a nation building exercise, as a reason why America has the right to aggressively acquire more territory in the name of manifest destiny, and to blame others for the war's instigation, is close to a crime against history.

The War of 1812, declared by the US and begun by US aggression against a weaker nation (Canada) was fought for no good reason, caused the pointless deaths of thousands, caused untold misery and destruction, nearly destroyed a nation, and for what? Well, they eventually got a national anthem out of it.

Like Iraq and Afghanistan. Except the Americans already have an anthem.

If you are an American, then this DVD is for you. Just don't expect everyone else to take it at face value.",1277510400,15,2840,4.891891891891892
2200209,3,B000742G0G,"I'll repeat the other reviews in saying this is a good buy if you are looking for an overview of the War of 1812. It covers the broad strokes of the war and spends most of its time on the sack of Washington, the bombardment of Baltimore, and the battle of New Orleans. The Ironclad bit is baffling but that isn't my real problem with this dvd. k

Someone mentioned earlier the obvious pro-American bias in the film and that wouldn't have bothered me - I'm American so I love hearing about how great I am just for being born in the right place - except for the fact that in the rush to cut the less glamorous parts of the war, the program leaves out huge chucks of very interesting bits of history that had a real impact on the course of history. I don't think I heard one mention of Isaac Brock through out the program. Nor a mention of Tecumseh. Oliver Perry doesn't get mentioned. Not even future American President - for a very short while anyway - William Henry Harrison is heard of. The program got so caught up in talking about the National Anthem and the burning of Washington that it took 2 hours to impart a set of facts that could have been told in twenty minutes.

That aside, there were also a few factual errors. First the the film makes it sound like impressment was the sole issue of the war with other issues as merely peripherals. This doesn't come close to the truth. The Orders in Council had as much to do with the war as any other issue. The program also states the impressment was abolished by the British government right after war was declared. This is also false. What was repealed were the Orders in Council - impressment stayed. It also says that there were antiwar protest in Baltimore. The opposite was true. Baltimore was a Pro-War city. The incident they program refered to was one where Pro-war rioters assaulted anti-war Federalist in their homes and beat some to death (Fun fact - Robert E. Lee's father was almost for being a Federalist). And it implies that the battle of New Orleans mattered in any way other than launching Andrew Jackson to the presidency.

It hits the broad strokes and if that's what you're looking for, then buy it but if your a history buff looking for historically accurate and informative entertainment look elsewhere.",1276387200,,2279,4.5
2200210,3,B000742G0G,"I'm a teacher, and I had hopes for this series but it's not great. All the facts are there but the telling is... well propagandistic.

The primary documentary on the war of 1812 is pretty good, even if it does make it appear as though G-d was actively on the side of a U.S. win.

The one about the flag is good from an informational standpoint, but would send my students to sleep.

The documentary about Jackson tends to really push how unfairly maligned he has been by history. There are other, better, documentaries out there, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andrew-Jackson-Good-Evil-and-the-Presidency/dp/B00115Q6N8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andrew Jackson: Good, Evil and the Presidency</a>&nbsp;also shown on the history channel, that are far more even-handed about him. The linked documentary shows his brilliance and value while not trying to skirt the issue that he was also a deeply prejudiced individual, and address things like his ultimate betrayal of Indian allies without whom he might not have won the battle for New Orleans and the trail of tears. It also addresses the irony of his face being on our twenty dollar bills today.",1274054400,,1196,5.489130434782608

I wish they had given more info about France/England before the War and included the Quadruple Alliance after (and how that played into the Monroe Doctrine a few years later), but those are just nitpicks about things best saved for a documentary not aimed at a general audience.  The sermon in a sentence? It is just stunningly done.  FWIW, the chapters on The Burning of Washington and the Battle of New Orleans are among the recreations I've ever seen.

The Biography on Old Hickory (Disc 2) provides some great details, but the picture quality is substantially lower than on Disc 1...you can tell it was recorded much earlier and later digitized.

The segment with Roger Daughtry was amusing and did touch on life aboard ship, but still doesn't give a lot of historical information.

2200217,4,B000742G0G,"If you do not, like most people, know anything about the War of 1812-the so-called- `forgotten war'- or even if you are familiar with its details then this History Channel presentation will give you more than you will ever want to know about that event. I know, despite my intense love of the study of history, that I had had enough once I got through this two volume four hours plus work. Mercifully it is broken up into sections so, for the faint-hearted, you can pick and choice. In any case, the section entitled First Invasion is must viewing to get an overall sense of the conflict.

So what is all the bother about? Well the short answer, very short is that this war against old Mother England was the definitive moment when the seemingly improbable American victory announced to the world that fragile as the Republic was, and as isolated and uncomplicated its people that it was now a factor, if at that time a small factor, in the international scheme of things. Not bad for a `forgotten war'. Remember if the bloody British had been victorious America would have a name like, say, the United States of Canada. The History Channel's presentation shows that this victory was a near thing. Suffering defeats, the torching of the capital, internal dissension and an apparently inevitable defeat at New Orleans after a peace treaty was signed this motley group of American yeomen and women broke through to preserve a slender democracy.

No look at the War of 1812 is complete without acknowledging the role of two men of opposing temperaments, James Madison under whose presidency the issues became clarified and the causes of war outlined and Andrew Jackson whose victory at New Orleans sealed the fate of the country. By this last point I do not mean merely Jackson's military victory but the rush toward a plebian democracy that the forces who fought the war unleashed. Later in the century the children and grandchildren of those fighters would be lost in the scramble to make an America a capitalist fortress but back then the American world was young and fresh.

Here are some true facts: The War of 1812 was fought across a large part of Eastern North America and many common people lost their property and lives in a range of brutal ways. A sizeable portion of Washington D.C was and ransacked and burned by a combined British and Canadian Army after the U.S. Army fled in panic. The ""glorious"" Battle of New Orleans was actually fought after the end of hostilities (the combatants had not yet heard that the war was over). NO NATION WON THIS WAR, since at the end, all captured lands were returned to the original owners. So, where's the glory?

First and foremost is the film entitled ""The Invasion"" which is a good account of the war.  Viewers who are familiar with the War of 1812 will be disappointed as it has its limitations.  Those who are discovering this war for the first time will find it informative.  Granted, there are aspects of the war that are overlooked (military personalities, the Great Lakes battles) but by and large it is a good ""high school caliber"" documentary.  I do agree with others who say the person portraying James Madison is ridiculously cast.  Where they found this unemployed linebacker is beyond any comprehension of who Madison was (especially since the narrator described him as small in stature but large in intellect).

As said, if the program ended here it would have been adequate (but would not have justified the price).  So mini documentaries on the Star Spangled Banner, the Battle of New Orleans, and inronclad ships also made their way into the package.  OK the Battle of New Orleans segment was very good.  The Star Spangled Banner piece was at least time period appropriate, but the ironclads film was way off the mark.  Ironclads had no role in 1812, so why include it in the program?  This piece of editing more or less flaws the entire set and leaves the historian wondering what is going on?
