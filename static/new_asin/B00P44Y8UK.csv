6787484,4,B00P44Y8UK,"The item is larger than I was expecting, so it won't fit in my DVD/Blu-ray shelving.  The book is 9in tall and 7.5in wide.  The dagger is 9x1.  The use of heavy paper sleeves glued to the book's pages was a bad design.  The artwork inside the book is great.

The details list the discs as being Regions A & B, but this is incorrect. The Evil Dead, Army of Darkness, and Evil Dead are Regions A, B, & C.  Evil Dead 2 is Region B only.",1434240000,146,433,3.9195402298850577
6787485,5,B00P44Y8UK,"this is by far the ultimate evil dead box set, great design by effects master tom sullivan and loaded with special features, this set also includes the directors cut of army of darkness and the documentary invaluable... if you are a true evil dead fan i would highly recommend picking this up as soon as you can before its gone.",1429228800,6,328,4.483333333333333
6787486,4,B00P44Y8UK,"The Evil Dead Anthology set is simply fantastic. You get all 3 of the older films, Evil Dead, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. Also included is the remake of Evil Dead and it's loaded with bonus material. The transfers are great on these disc. The book itself, is great, boasting a ""fleshy"" feel, much like the old Anchor Bay Book editions. The Kandarian Dagger is also a nice prop to put alongside your collection. My only downfall with this set is the disc packaging. They are in cardboard sleeves attatched to the pages. This does not make easy access and the glue holding the sleeves comes apart very easily. I actually transferred all my discs to a multi-disc case and use the book and dagger as display. It's a great set and all lovers of the films and collector's, this is a must have. Make sure you have a Region Free player.",1427932800,24,835,4.428571428571429

All 4 films on blu ray stored in the Necronomicon! Freaking awesome. Love the book and the art work. Worth every penny.",1483056000,2,255,4.565217391304348

6787494,5,B00P44Y8UK,Absolutely fantastic collectible. Did not realise the discs are held inside a mock Book of the Dead. Great purchase.,1475884800,,116,5.157894736842105

6787497,5,B00P44Y8UK,"I love this series so much. The Nekronomicon is BADASS and the anthology works fine, minus Evil Dead 2--but, only a minor inconvenience for this amazing collectors item. The dagger is pretty rad, too!",1464134400,3,200,4.911764705882353
6787498,1,B00P44Y8UK,Evil Dead 2 does not even play in the Blu-ray disc player that it's been advertised to play it you have to go out and buy a special component to watch the desk after an hour and a half on the phone with Amazon I have to spend my own money and send it back this was a present I can't take a present back from someone and tell them they have to send it back they should not advertise that all the discs are Blu-ray compatible if they are not very disappointed,1457827200,6,457,3.924731182795699
6787499,4,B00P44Y8UK,"First and foremost this set is awesome. The quality of the book and the little knife thing was very good. Each had a slight weight to it that I liked. I bought this product as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He hadn't opened it until recently thus the late review. Everything inside came packaged safely and securely. HOWEVER, I am docking a star because one of the discs provided was in the wrong region code. The others were for the U.S., but the one disc (I believe it was the first of the series) was not. If that had not been the case it'd be an easy 5 star product.",1453680000,,577,4.207207207207207
6787500,5,B00P44Y8UK,With the resurgence of Evil Dead with the TV show Ash & The Evil Dead; this was an awesome Christmas Gift for the husband who is a big horror and  Bruce Campbell fan.  The book which holds the DVD's is creepy as hell and the knife is cool too.  He was very surprised and loved it. Excellent addition to his ever growing DVD collection.,1453248000,,335,4.203125
6787501,5,B00P44Y8UK,great edition to the collection love the artwork,1451692800,,48,5.125
6787502,1,B00P44Y8UK,Is this anthology region coding? Is this product a nearly 200$ POS .my wife just spent 29$ on a blue ray trilogy for only one disc to work. Sooooo pissed.,1446768000,7,154,4.166666666666667
6787503,2,B00P44Y8UK,"READ THE DESCRIPTION! !!! You will need to buy the Evil Dead 2 separately if you live in the USA. It will not play on a regular Blu-ray player because it is set up for Zone B...which is Australia. Also, one of the bonus disks will not play for the same reason.  I'm  pretty disappointed considering this was a gift for my husband, but he loved everything else about it.",1445558400,38,369,4.257142857142857

6787505,3,B00P44Y8UK,Liked it but some of the inner pictures were cartoony  I was looking for more of the movie version of ex mortis,1442620800,,111,4.045454545454546
6787506,5,B00P44Y8UK,"If you are a fan of the cult classic Rami films this is a must have,  beautifully presented in this collectors edition you get all the movies plus extras!  Though I already own the movies separately I purchased this for the explicit intent of cast signatures while at the 2015 Chicago Wizard World Comic con.  Signed by the entire cast form Evil Dead 1 and 2 (of course including Mr. Bruce Cambell) as well as the special effects masters this is now one of my most prized collectables.",1442275200,4,485,4.488636363636363

8686348,4,B00P44Y8UK,"I love this item.  I'd give it a five star, but, strangely enough, the second disc was region locked.  I didn't bother contacting the seller, as this item was brand new in the box, and everything else was perfect.  So it was a factory mishap.",1522627200,,242,4.333333333333333
8686349,3,B00P44Y8UK,Came with everything promised but the evil dead 2 disc was not from the anthology. Every other disc works but that one.,1519603200,,119,4.454545454545454
8686350,1,B00P44Y8UK,Came with an evil dead 2 from another region that refuses to play on my xbox 1. Bought this for the soul reason that evil dead 2 is one of my favorite movies and it doesn't work. Why even sell this?,1513728000,,198,3.8536585365853657
8686351,3,B00P44Y8UK,"Do not order this unless you have a regionless bluray player.
I knew that when purchasing, decided to get it anyway.  The reason for my 3 star rating is how poorly made the disk holding slots. It's a very thin paper cd case glued to the pages of the book. They don't seem like they'll last long.",1503878400,4,295,4.175438596491228

8686355,2,B00P44Y8UK,"Seller needs to specify that Evil Dead 2 will not play at all on a USA DVD player!!!!

Other than that flaw it is great for a collection!",1491782400,,137,3.892857142857143
8686356,2,B00P44Y8UK,"This would have been a very awesome set and I would have been 100% satisfied if it wasn't for the misleading region code, listing A/1 as one of the regions for this product. It is true that most of the discs do in fact work on an A/1 region blu ray player, however, Evil Dead 2 is not compatible nor is the bonus disc 1 on my player.  In fact, the Evil Dead 2 disc does not seem to have the ""Evil Dead Anthology"" label on it that is show in the photo, making me believe this set may have had some disc replacement issues already. I don't wish to simply return this set for two discs but it would be nice if I could get replacement discs for those two that are not compatible with a region A/1 player.",1490572800,3,700,4.0
