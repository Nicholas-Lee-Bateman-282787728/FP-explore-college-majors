8553300,5,B00ALFGP94,Great workout!,1468972800,,14,6.5
8553301,5,B00ALFGP94,This is a really great barre DVD! I love all of the physique 57 DVDs and most of the Bar Method DVDs because of the quick pace And intensity of the exercises. This DVD is very similar to those. They had modifications if you needed them and also advanced versions. If you like barre  workouts I highly recommend this DVD.,1435017600,4,320,4.333333333333333
8553302,2,B00ALFGP94,"I got this from my local library and I'm very glad I didn't waste my money on it. The thigh section is too short and not intense enough to burn any real calories. The arm and ab sections are better, but noting new or creative. I really enjoy Physique 57 DVDs if you're looking for a fun and super effective Barre style workout.",1389139200,,327,4.2063492063492065
8553303,5,B00ALFGP94,"I do a lot of different cardio and weight workouts geared mostly toward advanced exercisers.  Some I have done include Cathe (all of hers), Insanity, P90X, Body Beast, Barrys Bootcamp, Dream Body, etc.  Anyways, I work out 6 days per week and sometimes I just want something not too cardio intense and not too weight intense.  This workout fits that bill.  There are lots of small pulse like moves that make you wanna cry sometimes, but just when you think you can't do anymore, she changes moves.  I like the flow of the workouts and they really fly by.  I have done P57 and I didn't like those workouts because of the constant blabbering of the instructor.  I have no annoyance factor like that with this workout.  It's definitely not as difficult as the Dream Body workouts, but like I said, sometimes you want something not as intense, yet not a waste of time either.  I gave it 5 stars because I really like doing this workout, my muscles get a good burn, and I look forward to doing it......which means I will use it on a long term basis making it a winner for me!",1386374400,9,1070,4.418367346938775
8553304,5,B00ALFGP94,"After doing this workout 2-3 times a week for just six weeks I have to say it has made a huge difference in my legs and thighs. I have worked out regularly for years but I wanted to try something new and decided to try some barre routines.  I particularly like this one as it is not too ""ballet-ish"" nor is it too long. Since I was not just starting an exercise program I was not anticipating such noticable results but I am now shopping for smaller jeans. Like all barre type programs you need to pay attention to how you are doing the moves to get the most out of it but the instructor gives good cues and the time goes by quickly. I would have liked a little more arm work but would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone wanting something low impact with big results.",1366761600,5,772,4.216216216216216
8553305,2,B00ALFGP94,"I bought this dvd based on many positive reviews and felt that I wasted 45 minutes doing it. The word Amped made me feel that it would be challenging,but I did not sweat at all and felt that the thigh work was over so quick that I did not feel worked at all. I would not do this again,as my trouble spot is my thighs and I did not feel as though this dvd even touched on the lower body. A much better dvd is Physique 57 Thigh&Seat or Tracy Mallets Booty Barre beginners&beyond. I always read reviews before I purchase a workout dvd,as I have quite a few and I'm always looking for a challenge. I feel very let down after trying this one. Since I'm always pressed for time I try to choose workouts that give me a great burn within my time limits and this was a complete waste.",1365984000,4,775,4.105263157894737
