8500529,4,B006LXMKPI,"The box cover is misleading because it has Walter Becker there with his buzz cut and this is the same concert that was out in another format called
'Steelydan' Perfection in performance. I thought I was getting one of the latest concerts before Walters Passing. I failed to see the '2008'. The concert took place somewhere in North Carolina. The format from perfection in performance was actually a widescreen format which had a logo on it called 'Show'. Sound familiar? Isn't that short for 'Showtime'? Anyhow, this one has the distorted look where everyone looks to be 30 pounds heavier. Worse, the end has been cut out where they play this sad Jazz Tune and Donald wishes everyone a good night and walks off the stage with Walter. The perfection in performance Dvd is no longer available so you die hard Steelydan fans are going to want to jump on this before it is too late. True fans will appreciate this Dvd because when have you ever seen them play 'Deacon Blues' live? I was so surprised to see Mike McDonald walk out on stage when I first got the other Dvd. The back ground singers are fantastic and that was so nice for all you soul lovers. 'Beautifully performed'. I have a 200 and something dollar pair of head phones and it sounds just fine for all you old school soul brothers. You also get ""I got the news"" from the AJA album. ""Time out of Mind'  and 'Aja' is done so nicely and Walter just kicks ass all over this concert with so many cool riffs. This is all that is left now I believe so you might want to consider snatching it up before it goes. 'Everything must go' Donald stated. Now Walter is gone so this is it folks. We are next. Enjoy while you can.",1506556800,5,1673,4.396774193548387
8500530,1,B006LXMKPI,"Worst DVD ever!!!?? It's surely possible. Video taken from the nosebleed aspect through a purple haze of lighting plus a petrolatum-smeared camera lens. Audio was horrendous. The only song worse than Michael McDonald's slow-motion version of Show Biz Kids; was having the backup singers moan their way through Dirty Work.
DVD is entitled ""Time Out of Mind."" If you buy this, you will be ""Out of your Mind"" & ""Out of your Money.""
Going to try and get back my money from the seller.",1505433600,4,480,4.726190476190476
8500531,1,B006LXMKPI,"This is really a  Minus -0- Star!  The WORST concert Dvd I ever bought!  I buy and currently have a collection of maybe 30+ concert Dvds!  This one has Very POOR recording, HORRIBLE sound! And these 2 chicks sang one of my favorite songs ""Dirty Woirk"", by themselves!? Why? That's like mother Teresa singing MJ's ""Billie Jean""!  Or Charles Madsen doing ""We are Family""!  he only other concert dvd worse was - The Beatles Live: Washington DC 1964 / Shea Stadium 1965 / Paris Concert 1965 / Budokan 1966 [DVD (Don't Buy either of these!)  RIP OFF!!!  I'm returning if the seller provides a FREE return label cause not worth spending any more $$  ***** RIP OFF!!!!  ****** JUNK!!!!!!!!!",1504915200,3,683,4.663865546218488
