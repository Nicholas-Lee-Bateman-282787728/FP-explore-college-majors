8462075,3,B0058OR3OY,"Keith Lowell Jensen's Cats Made of Rabbits is a 75 minute stand-up comedy show filmed at the Sacramento comedy spot in 2009. I've decided after watching that the show was interesting, with a few chuckles. I didn't dislike the show, and it didn't give me any belly laughs either. It's almost something that you would listen to while doing something else. Something for background noise. It would have made a better CD release than a DVD release. Again, that's not to say it's a bad show, just that none of it struck me as hilariously funny, or had any material that I'd like to revisit at a later date.

Here's a bit of information about him from The Rooftop's comedy website.

Keith Lowell Jensen has performed with Robin Williams, Doug Stanhope, Will Durst, Norm Macdonald and Bruce Campbell. He's toured the country as the atheist on The Coexist? Comedy Tour and as the emcee for Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation.

In 2011 Jensen was invited to perform three sets at The Bridgetown Comedy Festival in Portland Oregon.

Jensen's feature length documentary film Why Lie I Need A Drink, about the myth of the affluent panhandler is now out on DVD.

To The Moon, Live at Luna's is Jensen's first CD. His second CD and first Stand Up DVD, Cats Made of Rabbits is set for release in September of 2011.

Jensen appeared on Lopez Tonight performing in a skit along side Chris Rock. Before that he was featured as a panhandling expert on an episode of Manswers on Spike TV. Next he's hoping he'll get a spot on The Home Shopping Network where he'll get to describe something as ""Genuine Faux!""

So, if you're a fan of Keith Lowell Jensen, you'll find this 75 minute show & its' extras to be a great value, it just wasn't my cup of tea. 5/10.",1372032000,,2167,4.516624040920716
8462076,5,B0058OR3OY,"Jensen is a smart comedian with a naturally funny story-telling style that might make you forget that his act is an act.  I've watched a lot of stand-up comedy specials on TV and I enjoyed this more than I did most of those.  By the way, he might make you think but you'll be laughing enough that you won't mind it.",1321574400,2,315,4.147540983606557
