8219978,5,B000VTQL2Q,Simply the best class of jiu-jitsu i ever saw...,1404950400,3,48,4.444444444444445
8219979,4,B000VTQL2Q,Some of the techniques/ concepts covered are so different from traditional Japanese jiu jitsu that it was confusing when I tried attempt to apply them.  I don't think this is Saulo's fault.  The guy is just really high level and is an artist.  I think Saulo has done a great job with the material and it is insightful.  It is a revolution on the traditional principles.  I would just go with a more traditional look at jiu jitsu first.  When you have a really solid understanding of those fundamentals I think this dvd could be more helpful at that point.  -meaning it's easier to see what rules can be bent of broken.  I may have just jumped the gun in looking at this too soon in my own development,1404000000,,700,4.372093023255814
8219980,5,B000VTQL2Q,"Bought this after buying the first series. Great info and presentation, easy to follow and each technique is presented numerous times from different angles. As always, I received the order promptly from this supplier.",1383436800,2,217,5.411764705882353
8219981,5,B000VTQL2Q,"I am a purple belt,
 I love Saulo's dvd's this set covers even more of the great Ribeiro BJJ that revolution 1 does.
My training partners from white to black are all enjoying it as well, my instructor began teaching the x pass, he too loves saulo's theorys and technic.
 The pass works well and is easy for just about anyone to learn and use, thats Saulo's BJJ, no gimmics or muscle, just pure BJJ...works for white belts, young and old as well as the hardcore advanced folks as well.
 just the x pass alone is worth the cost of the dvd set, not mention the running escape which is covered in his Book, but the dvd really makes it clear how the escape works,, I have been studying the dvds everyday, they will help get me too brown belt and beyond.
BJJ is alot fun and Saulo brings even more joy to training

Thank You Saulo, you are a great teacher and human being, thank you sharing your knowledge with the world
I hope to meet you one day!",1265414400,11,942,4.216666666666667
8219982,4,B000VTQL2Q,"I bought these tapes and use them for when I am home and do not make class, I find that it helps me to review the small things that make a move work or not. And I have to say that after watching these tapes a few times I was already using the moves in class and they were helping me finish off. Saulo Ribeiro is a legend himself and he is an excellant teacher. I highly recommend these tapes for anyone who trains",1247097600,,413,3.9285714285714284
8219983,5,B000VTQL2Q,"Really awesome dvd series. Really gets to the point. It amazing how so many moves can be interlinked by the fine details which many tend to forget about. He really makes a point in showing the ""secret"" behind the moves. If learning from a book, its easy to miss them in your game.

Once you get the picture I think anyones game can be moved to new levels, beginner and pro alike. The only problem is that the quantity of moves is less then Revolution 1. Quality rather then quantity, the producers obviously decided on.",1233878400,9,519,4.463157894736842
8219984,5,B000VTQL2Q,"This is a great follow on to Saulo's 1st set and this in conjunction with his no-gi set really gives you a good overall game.
Definately the highlight of this set is the takedown disc, well worth the price of the whole set!",1216252800,7,223,4.209302325581396
