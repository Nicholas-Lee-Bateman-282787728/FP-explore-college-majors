Stunning scenery,good acting,flamenco,all make this a great movie. As a descendant of these people I enjoyed a look into a culture that was unknown to me. Another thing that was all too realistic for me was the central character Caco's lack of fear of mortality due to his daughter being deceased;I lost my 4 year old daughter on 9/11/02 and I no longer fear  dying if my daughter and I will be reunited.",1060473600,,571,4.653465346534653
1883992,4,B00009MEA1,"A stunning ""audioscape"" of pure flamenco. The only reason this film did not get a 5th star from me is for its over-acting and simplistic plot. But maybe that's not such a bad thing. It would take the focus away from the power of the music and cinematography. You can literaly pause the movie at any point, and find perfect shots of rich blends of colors and textures that capture the essence of this film, not to mention look like museum-exhibit-quality photos. But it was both the cinematography and music that made this film so stunning. The best scene by far had to be the old man and woman team under a tent in an open field, belting out complex and soul-stirring notes from simply a voice and a guitar. The true story of this film is in its music.

Now, how about that soundtrack???!!!",1107043200,3,790,4.448275862068965
1883993,4,B00009MEA1,"This movie is very moving.  For me, the beauty of it lies in the portrayal of the ways that gypsies deal with their sorrows and their traditions.  Yes, the plot is simple, but there is so much beauty in its simplicity because it brings out so many details about the lives that we, westerners, don't know much about.

Let's start from the whitewashed village of Andalucia, where the family lives.  You will see the chemistry, the bonds of the gypsy family life, the division of responsibility, so to speak, between the young and old, men and women.  You'll see the infamous puti clubs, embodied by Caco's El Rey, the sad dealings of sorrow and revenge between two families that not many generations ago were brought up together.  You will be profoundly affected by way that Caco, the protagonist, cares for his crippled nephew and will be very, very amused by Alejandro's search for cell phone connection in the middle of the highway.

All of the aforementioned factors make this movie very worthy of your time, without starting to mention the beauty of flamenco.  One of the things that struck me was the ease with which Caco would throw parties and invite flamencos from all over Spain. The recently deceased La Paquera de Jerez sings por seguiriya, i believe, and La Cajita's presence will stir a few butterflies in your stomach, along with other flamencos, and most notably, the beautiful moorish dancers in white spinning to the old moor's voice will be a dance you won't easily forget.

I would definitely recommend this movie, not so much for flamenco purposes (which was mine) but for a better awareness of the gypsy culture.  Now, please don't misunderstand me and quote me as saying that this is what the gypsy life is, because for most part, it's not, but it definitely brings some exposure about to values and their ways of life.",1103068800,7,1840,4.739811912225705
1883994,5,B00009MEA1,"The title that I gave this review sums it up. This film is an excellent look at a people (Los Gitanos) whose every act or thought is infused with passion. Passionate dance, passionate music, passionate love of Life, and passionate hate. The essential plot concerns two feuding gypsy clans in southern Spain, Andalucia (the birthplace of Flamenco). A Clan's brother has been killed by the brother of the protagonist. The protagonist seeks to protect the life of his handicapped nephew, who is the son of the initial murderer. However, the story is played out to its tragic end with a backdrop of excellent Flamenco music and dancing. As with the story, Flamenco music and dance can not be easily described as beautiful, or even wonderful; some of the songs are quite discordant. The best word to use is compelling; one is entirely drawn into it emotionally, used up by it, and left exhausted, literally. It has an hypnotic effect to it, using all the themes of Life: Joy, Jealously, Betrayal, Love, Sex, and the tragedy of Death. This film and El Flamenco Puro are mirrors, held up to each other. This film, and Flamenco, are the stories of our lives, but told passionately. Always passionately. Watch the film, and be prepared to be swept away by the Passion!",1086048000,8,1259,4.779816513761468
1883995,4,B00009MEA1,"You must love Flamenco music first, before you have any chance with this movie. It will not make you like Flamenco, but if you have a passion for it already there are wonderful musical performances here by great artists: The guitar playing, the complicated hand clapping, the singing, and dancers dancing in their regular street clothes as the flamenco erupts for the moment informally, as is the gypsy life style of Southern Spain.
The story is another matter; a vague beginning, poor and unclear plot development about two warring families, the need for revenge (VENGO), with a slight twist at the end. The plot development is so cloudy it takes a while to figure out it is all very standard. But there is an interesting, inspiring treatment of a spastic teenager as one of the crowd, very well done. This movie has highs and lows. The opening scene is wonderful combination of improvised flamenco and Moroccan music. It was 20 minutes later I figured out it was a funeral scene, later I realized it was a funeral scene for the main character's daughter, who I later figured out may have been a Sufi dancer.  The movie is not a mystery, it is just lacking in explanation sometimes.
It is as if the director had a few very good ideas, putting them into the movie with much soul and fire, never worrying about the overall continuity, as if the passion was justification enough (perhaps that also is very gypsy).  The DVD has practically nothing in the way of extras.
Final Word?  If you like Flamenco, see this movie (I rented it from Blockbuster).",1083456000,27,1548,4.6838235294117645
1883996,3,B00009MEA1,"I found this film to be disappointing. Yes, the music and flamenco dancing is wonderful. But as I am enduring this film I can't help but think that the director used every possible moment to ""shove"" some sort of dancing or singing into the story line which in and of itself needed a lot of work.
I love the culture from Spain and just about all it has to offer. A pattern I seem to notice with the many films Spain produces is that taboo issues are brought to the service. For example in this film, the nephew is mentally disabled. I don't know if in real life this actor is or not but how often do you see this in American films? Another example would be Pedro Almodvar's film All About My Mother where several characters struggle with HIV, or Noriega's main role in Abre Los Ojos where a good looking man loses it all to being facially disfigured. My point is these films are art reflecting real life situations. A more realistic experience in my opinion make for a more enjoyable experience. Flamenco has some gorgeous cinematography, the acting was quite good, the story and how it flowed  just needed a lot of polishing.",1080000000,4,1125,4.461165048543689
1883997,4,B00009MEA1,"I am just a Gringo with some buried Gitano genes who took a while watching the beginning of the movie on what was really going on.  But then, I was went with the flow of emotion and passion that was emoted --and enjoyed it more rather than trying to analyze--  I had a hard time reading the credits and would like to know specifically where the filming was done in Southern Spain--Jerez area?  What was the river?  and the party boat looked like it was moored at seaside?  Also, who sang the beautiful ballad/song at the end of the movie--very haunting",1077235200,2,552,4.425742574257426
1883998,4,B00009MEA1,Great music . . . not much of a story but wonderful to listen to.,1077062400,,65,3.4
1883999,4,B00009MEA1,"This is a really interesting and thought-provoking film - and very much worth seeing. I wasn't wowed by the flamenco, with the possible exception of La Caita's singing in a fiesta that takes place in a restaurant. The best flamenco are little bits where the characters are standing around being bored, start doing palmas, and then take turns doing little dance moves.
The north African music and dancing, on the other hand, are absolutely wonderful. There's a Sufi singer and some dancers who just knocked my socks off. I don't know what the hell they have to do with the rest of the film (nor why Gatlif had flamenco guitar superstar Tomatito noodling along during some of their singing and dancing), but I'm sure glad that they were included.
Another interesting and unusual musical moment is a percussion ""symphony"" of mechanical sounds, composed by Gatlif.
The most remarkable character in the film is Diego, a young man with cerebral palsy whose father has fled to Morocco and whose adoring uncle, Caco, is continually arranging flamenco fiestas for his entertainment. The film makes poetry out of every aspect of Diego's spastic bodily and facial movements, whether he's walking down the streets of Sevilla, talking about a beautiful woman, or taking his turn at dancing. When a payo like me sees that even a gitano kid with cerebral palsy can dance in comp&aacute;s, it's enough to make me burn my guitar.",1070496000,2,1412,4.912133891213389
1884000,5,B00009MEA1,"I am from the gypsy world so to me this movie is so real and so true that I was almost on the verge of tears. The music direction is amazing. This is like watching a Passolini movie - but a Passolini of modern days. The camera work is also good. If you get a chance watch this movie.
The movie is about that part of Spain which does not get publicity. Life here means more than football games and TV - it is music and the passion for music. Life and death are part of a flow where everybody gets the chance to die (some with honor and some as sacrifice). The passion behind this movie is beyond imagination - the only recent movie I can compare with is ""Sound of Music"" but at a much grand scale.",1063411200,4,696,4.014388489208633
1884001,5,B00009MEA1,"This is a powerful , hipnotic, tour de force movie that captures the soul of flamenco. Although it is not a documentary  and is a drama it has the feel of a documentary. This is probably because the realism is brought out by Algerian-born director Tony Gatlif's use of ""real"" flamenco artists as opposed to actors. The lead is taken by Antonio Canales who in real life is a renowned dancer. Ironically he does not dance in the film but plays the role of a leader of a gypsy clan that is at odds with a rival clan of gypsies. The thin plot evolves around avenging the death of a family member of the rival clan. Caco is the name of Canales in the movie and he is a man with a heavy heart after the death of his young daughter  and the responsibility of keeping his clan together and protecting his nephew who suffers, although you'd hardly know it, from  cerebral palsy.  Many of the scenes involving Caco and his nephew are funny as they romp from bar to as Caco looks to find him a ""good time"" with some beautiful women. The plot is nothing exceptional but the film draws it's superb power from the fantastic musical performances. Set in Andalusia, the stark landscape, the whitewashed churches  contrasting with the dressed in black clan is a powerful reminder of the roaming gypsy existence steeped in a long ancestral heritage. The clan moves about in old cars, and a flat bed truck that doubles as a stage as they set up daily for their night of wine, dance and music. The fiery flamenco music is the real reason to see this movie. The performances by such greats as Tomatito, La Caita, Gritos de Guerra and La Paquera is nothing short of spellbinding. The close camera work reveals the duende in the faces of the performers as they collaborate for the best scenes of the movie,  and there are many of them as it is full of emotion. An interesting aspect of this movie is how director Gatliff incorporates the history and ethnic mixes of flamenco into the film by using Sheik Ahmad Al Tuni as a vocalist on several songs amidst Turkish flutes blown by Kudsi Erguner, interwoven by masterful guitar work by Emilio Fernandez de Los Santos  and Ramon Pisa Borja, who also sings on occcasion. Naturally all of the performances are accentuated by palmas(clapping), gritos( guttural shout outs) and lively percussion. Many of the singing  and dancing performances are done by women and the harsh , throaty sounds emanate and penetrate deep from their souls. I keep saying performance but in actuality  you feel as though you are not watching a performance but are watching a lively get together of family members; it is truly amazing stuff that will captivate you. The spontaneity of the clan in action  is a dervish whirlwind of activity that is the extended family personified. As the clan adds color to the landscape by bringing out their huge pillows and blankets, the tranformation begins to take shape as the music starts to capture the spirit of southern Spain. You are more of a witness to an extraordinary celebration of life in spite of it's sometimes tragic consequences.  If you love flamenco than you will love this movie. If you are new to or have limited knowledge of flamenco you will be engrossed and probably seek out some flamenco music afterwards. This is a powerful piece that reveals the soul of flamenco. Highly recommended for flamenco aficionados.",1062115200,27,3371,4.658249158249158
7991332,5,B00009MEA1,Very few movies can truly demonstrate the beauty and sounds of the art of Flamenco. Vengo is a marvelous portrayal of real Spanish Flamenco (Estilo Gitano).,1482537600,,156,5.038461538461538
7991333,5,B00009MEA1,"The insert accompanying the DVD release of Tony Gatlifs amazing film VENGO gives a succinct but very informative background on the forces that combined to create the musical form called flamenco  a perfect storm of Christian, Hebrew, Muslim and, later, Gitano cultures came together and something completely new and wonderful was born. Its a process that continues to this day, blending musical flavorings from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and as far away as India into a tasty stew that is unequaled in its ability to express the joys, pain, passion, sorrow and loss that boil within everyone, yearning to freely express themselves, to share with others the emotions that live within the human heart and soul. Director Tony Gatlif has Gitano blood flowing in his veins  his love of his heritage, his respect for Roma history and culture, and his knowledge of the elements that have formed it (and continue to form it, for it is like an extensive living organism) have manifested in his art, resulting in some incredible filmmaking, his first work appearing as early as 1975. Especially notable among his other films are LATCHO DROM (1993), GADJO DILO (1998), SWING (2002), EXILS (2004) and TRANSYLVANIA (2006)  Roma culture and music play huge roles in all of them.

VENGO opens, appropriately enough, with a scene in which the viewer sees both musicians and listeners arriving by boat at a palatial residence perched high on a rock above the water. A guitarist (the great Tomatito, one of Spains finest) and violinist begin to play with amazing virtuosity, feeding off each other as if they were of one mind  after a few minutes, as if in response, a group of Arabo-Andalusian players take up their instruments. To the accompaniment of an oud, a violin, a flute, percussion and a chorus of responsive vocals, Sheikh Ahmad Al Tuni begins to sing, clinking on a glass for additional percussion, an ecstatic expression on his face. Soon the Gitano players come back in, with the whole picture underscoring the deep relationships between the cultures and musical forms that gave birth to flamenco.

Gatlifs camera cuts from the concert to a shot of the whitewashed walls of a church and its attached gallery of crypts, stark against a blue sky filled with rolling grey clouds  the dramatic element of the film comes into play. Caco (pictures above, wonderfully played by Antonio Canales, known in Spain as a fine dancer), the head of a Gitano clan, stands before the tomb of a young woman who is revealed to be his daughter Pepa  his grief is deep and clear, and its effects on him and those around him will become even clearer as the film progresses. Leaving the churchyard, Caco and his entourage  family members and bodyguards  arrive at their village to find graffiti scrawled across the wall : Sandro  you will be avenged, the first allusion to the bad blood that exists between Cacos family and a rival clan. He immediately fears for the safety of his nephew, Diego (Orestes Villasan Rodriguez, in an absolutely stunning performance), racing up a hill to assure himself that the young man is safe.

The business of Cacos family  beyond his part-ownership of a Seville bar  is never detailed, but large bundles of cash are handled, instructions (both verbal and written, at times cryptic) are given and carried out at his bidding  theres never any implication that anything illegal or illicit is going on, but its possibility is there. An associate talks with Caco, communicating to him that he has a potential buyer for Cacos share of the bar  when asked the identity of the potential purchaser, hes told that the man wants to remain anonymous. This brings a comment from Caco referring to the Caravacas family  that scumbag family, he spits  further identifying his familys adversary, and the probably source of the threatening graffiti.

Sheltering and nourishing his nephew Diego and dealing with his own massive grief over the death of his daughter Pepa are the controlling forces in Cacos life  even as he works to keep the reins of their businesses tightly in hand. He takes Diego to Seville  a trip involving both business and pleasure  and introduces him to an apparent prostitute, a young woman he knows called La Catalana, with whom he has prearranged a liaison with the young man. Making an excuse of having to run an errand, he leaves the two of them alone together in an empty bar  later, after his return, as he and Diego walk down the darkened street together, he attempts to pry information from the boy about what happened between him and the woman. Diego is touchingly, shyly reticent, finally expressing, in response to Cacos macho So how was it? with a comment that illustrates the depth of his own thought, understanding and wisdom concerning such matters, It was good  but it wasn't love  its inspiring to see that he knows and recognizes the difference at his young age.

Later, the two of them meet up with other family members, friends and associates for a performance arranged and financed by Caco featuring one of Diegos favorite singers, La Caita, at a restaurant. This amazing singer was also featured in Gatlifs film LATCHO DROM   the sheer power and passion with which she throws herself into her cante is breathtaking. She sings, In the street of winds, your body and mine came together  this is the flame of the unfettered and untamed voice of pure emotion. Accompanied only by a guitar or two, some improvised percussion and palmas from around the table, she very nearly sets the screen on fire. Across the restaurant, a table filled with a couple of dozen soldiers listens  one of them strolls over to be closer to the music, with Alejandro (Cacos cousin, one of his bodyguards and his closest confidant, played with fine subtlety by Antonio Perez Dechent) showing concern that trouble might develop. More of the soldiers make their way over as the music comes to its incredible climax  at the end of La Caitas song, one of them calls out, Viva arte!, to which Alejandro replies, forcefully and with due pride, Viva flamencoflamenco puro! This performance by La Caita is a moving, graphic example of flamenco puro  the music that the Gitanos create for themselves, to give expression to their souls, as opposed to the flamenco that is performed for tourists, or the watered-down version propagated by so many elements of popular culture media.

Diego loves flamenco, and he loves to party  he mentions another group to Caco, Las Cigalas de Jerez, and his uncle promises to get them for their next party. It begins in the afternoon, eats up the night as if with a fork and knife, and continues on into the next morning. Cacos sorrow cannot be subdued by the music and revelry  its as visible in his eyes and on his face as an old scar. He consumes glass after glass of wine, finally passing out, helped by a couple of his aged aunts to a place where he can give in to his alcohol- and grief-induced slumber. As he slips into unconsciousness, he mutters his lost daughters name, Pepa and fades into the oblivion of sleep. At one point, in the light of morning, Diego looks in on him, showing that the love of family is more than a one-way street.

family, revealing the source of the bad blood between the two clans  Cacos brother Mario killed a member of their family, and they are grimly determined that someone has to pay for the death. The celebration around the christening of their dead brothers daughter, is seen by Caco as a chance for rapprochement  in the company of his bodyguards and family, he brings Diego to the gathering as a sign of good will, insisting that they have not come to insult the family of the dead man, but that he wants to talk, in order to heal the rift between them. Music again plays an important role in this scene, in the form of a performance by an absolute legend of cante flamenco, Paquera de Jerez. Caco and the brother of the slain Caravacas man separate themselves from the opposing entourages (who continue to exchange insults), but little is resolved. The tensions that have slowly and inexorably mounted throughout the film continue to do so, ultimately leading to the climax.

VENGO is remarkable for a number of reasons. Its well-written, creatively and sensitively directed, acted with a great mixture of believability and feeling, with impressive and moving cinematography  add to this the seamlessness with which Gatlif has combined the elements of drama and music, and you have something of very rare quality indeed. Ive viewed it a number of times now, and I always come away more impressed with it than before. The storyline is intelligent and well-developed, its portrayal of Gitano culture is never patronizing or simplistic, and the musical element is woven so naturally and tightly into the film that the viewer is never left with the feeling of watching a music video (a trap into which far too many films that attempt such a combination find themselves stumbling, despite their best intentions). The DVD release, through Home Vision Entertainment, features a sharp image that doesnt appear to suffer at all from over-zealous tweaking or image-boosting  and the sound is crystalline, allowing the dialogue, environmental sounds, and the stunning music to be heard unencumbered by any unnatural-sounding effects. There are a couple of nice bonus features as well  interviews with Antonio Canales and Antonio Dechent, and a short film entitled LOS ALMENDROS  PLAZA NUEVA, about contemporary Gitano life, that was shown at European film festivals in conjunction with VENGO.",1468627200,,9568,4.858548585485855

7991335,5,B00009MEA1,"The movie starts with main character name Caco (played by Antonio Canales) taking control of his clan after his brother flees Spain after killing another rival Gypsy clan's family member. The rival clan has threatened to kill Caco's brother, Mario if they find him and also threatened the life of Mario's son, Diego who is afflicted by cerebral palsy it seems. Oh and no he is not mentally retarded because if you understand Spanish you can easily come to the conclusion that Diego has all his mental faculties intact but Diego does come across as somewhat innocent and/or naive. Of which his physical condition has probably lead to him being sheltered by his family from totality of the negative aspects of their life style and dealings.

Anyhow, Caco and his group aren't exactly saints and it seems there is tinge of a underworld connection (apparently they run some sort of brothel called ""El Rey"" aka in English as ""The king"") to their dealings and by any standard of living these people are pretty well off. The old ladies on their estate are no doubt maids/servants of a near by village and Caco's men (body guards) are no doubt also from the local area though they all (including their rivals) apparently grew up together in the same local area as is later revealed in the story. Furthermore the main character Caco is also afflicted with an added emotional burden of having to deal with the death of his daughter who he greatly loved.

I will admit the plot is somewhat overshadowed by the great music found in this movie and the actual musicians and singers who do cameos. It appears that the director goes through great pains to subtly show the type of influences (Moors, Gypsy, etc) which have impacted the Flamenco musical genre and Spain itself. Over all the story is quite touching (Caco's love for his nephew and his sorrow over the lost of his daughter), the music and singing as I stated before is out of this world good IMHO. I won't spoil the ending but this is a great film to watch if you ever get a chance to do so and the music will more then make up for the thin gossamer of a plot in some instances.",1306195200,,2125,4.560209424083769
7991336,1,B00009MEA1,"I like flamenco by itself and prefer it not to be woven around some kind of ""story.""  I know this is a really politically incorrect thing to say, but I don't like films that feature people who are severly disfigured to the point where their body, motor skills, and speech are greatly impaired.  To make matters worse, there's a scene where this disabled person is introduced to a beautiful prostitute for the purpose of having an ""assignation.""  While they didn't actually show anything, I find this sort of thing to be utterly distasteful and I don't see how it adds to any film.  In fact, I couldn't even finish watching this film, let alone my dinner because I lost my appetite.

I purchased the film, ""Latcho Drom,"" another film by Tony Gatlif, which I loved, but I definitely wouldn't recommend ""Vengo"" to anyone.  If you want to see flamenco, there others to choose from.  Anyway, I'm sorry I purchased this.",1284508800,,914,4.675

I  have watched it a dozen times and it just gets better. Whoever buys this will get their moneys worth.",1216166400,,421,4.441558441558442
7991338,5,B00009MEA1,"It's really a pleasure to read some of the reviews on here and to share in the great appreciation and deep satisfaction that has been created by this film.

I think that if one has a personal understanding of the history of the circumstances which tie Andalucia and North Africa together, along with some of the cultural, social, and spiritual connections that are maintained between these two separate but connected worlds, the movie Vengo will strike you as being very symbolic.

There is a lot which is implied and will go right over your head if you are not aware of the culture and history of this region (as well as being aware of the life and struggles of Gatlif as a Gypsy man born in Algeria, caught between these two worlds). Gatlif does not spell anything out for you. He leaves it up to you to try to put the pieces together, and he knows that there are certain types of people, with a certain awareness, who will be attracted to his films.

I thought Vengo was incredibly deep with so much true emotion and so much of the subtle and misunderstood inner-struggles of the people of Andalucia being depicted through a number of overlapping stories and characters: The retarded nephew, the man whose daughter had died, the feuding Gypsy families, the exiled father of the son living in Morrocco, etc.

This movie told the tale of a people and their will to hold on to the purest (""Flamenco Puro!"") sources of happiness and joy within their lives, amidst circumstances which seemed destined to tear them a part and undermine their unity.

An incredibly beautiful story with lots of information, emotion, and spirit. If you are open, this movie will touch your soul.

7991340,5,B00009MEA1,"I lived in a small village in Andalucia for many years.  I am very grateful that I can appreciate this film for what it is, a visual love poem to the place, people and passions of the region as Gatlif's previous film Latcho Drom was to all of Roma culture.  Gatlif pays meticulous attention to every detail of how flamenco music and its people infuse and help define everyday Spanish life to this day.  It begins with a remarkable homage to flamenco's Muslim heritage featuring a living flamenco legend, Tomatito.  Although much is lost in the translation of the subtitles, lovers of a simpler, truly family-centered life will treasure poignant, visually satisfying vignettes of modern Spanish village life.  An entire family living together and lovingly caring for a disabled family member.  Gathering pomegranates together.  The enormous paella outside cooking to serve 50 family members at a christening.  People greeting one another as they get on the bus (this scene is from the heartbreakingly delightful short on the DVD which takes place in the sun-parched, narrow city streets of Almeria's gypsy neighborhood.).  The cemetery rituals.  The painted shutters and lace curtains on the windows.  The family's widows - harvesting olives, whitewashing graffiti off the village walls, cleaning up after the previous nights' flamenco party.  And the spontaneous outbursts of clapping, singing and dancing that occur anywhere - in the street, under a tree, on the bus.  These are all scenes still visible every day; they were not staged for a movie.

The melodrama in this film is no different from the polite, socially acceptable melodramas that play out every day in our own society; reputations, families, relationships are destroyed in a very refined, sanitary, occult manner.  The Spanish, and the gypsies in particular, have no concern for such posturing and show what is in their heart for all to see, even if it is the darkest pangs of human emotions.  From this comes the unequaled, boundless complexity and depth of flamenco.

I have been very fortunate to study flamenco with an Andalucian gypsy who grew up with and learned from Spain's greatest flamenco artists, among them her most beloved dancer, Carmen Amaya.  To understand this film, flamenco, and Spain, one must abandon all attempts to understand it and allow the duende - the spirit of flamenco - possess one's senses and one's soul.  Flamenco is not contrived enough to worry itself about a theme, a story line or impressing an audience.  It arises from a place deep within the soul that most of us keep carefully guarded and shut off.  That Gatlif has exposed it, once again, for us to experience I'm certain is success enough for him.",1125273600,42,2708,5.0134228187919465
7991341,5,B00009MEA1,"It's funny that a critic from the new york times could know so little about film.  I will not say much except this is one of the most simple, most beautiful stories made into cinema; there is absolutely no artifice, no tricks, and every detail is pure and genuine.  Tony uses faces Kurasawa could've killed for.  You ain't seen nothing if you ain't seen this.  The music, artists like Gritos de Guerra, La Caita, Sheik al Tuni, (seemingly unavailable on record, but better than anything I've heard,) seems to capture at once the joy and sorrow bound up in human life.  Likewise the players, most not actors. In fact, the music is so integrated into the lives of the characters, in the end there is no division.  For reviewers of respected periodicals, we would explain this is what is called thematic.  So much for the standards of education in journalism.  Even reviewers who really liked this movie did not fully understand this; like most really great art, it is ahead of the curve.  I suppose it should be possible to find a film as beautiful as this, as simple and captivating, but none come to mind.  Skip ""Vengo"" and your life will certainly be less rich.",1118188800,12,1162,4.597087378640777
