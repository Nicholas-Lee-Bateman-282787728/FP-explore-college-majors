It gives the viewer a look at his artistic process as well as provides great primary source material. Plus Segal is just so adorable to me so that helped too lol.",1429660800,,262,4.717391304347826

The video shows him at work, and was very enlightening about the details of his method/technique for wrapping his models with the plaster gauze. I've always wondered how he dealt with the clothing on the sculptures. He actually wraps the plaster gauze right around the individual garments and folds of the model's clothes as the model is wearing them. Surprisingly, it didn't totally destroy the model's clothes! On another piece (a woman bending forward at the waist), if you look carefully, you can see that he has put aluminum foil over the top of her head and her hair to protect it. Really cool-- this is lessening at least some of my concerns about trying to do this in class. I think, though, that we'll just start with some arms/hands and see how it goes, and take it from there. If you like Segal's work, you will enjoy this video.",1297296000,,989,4.625

As an art teacher, I would highly recommend this documentary for individuals in the upper elementary level on up. This personal look into one of the most famous Modern American artist, helps viewers understand his artwork and thought process.  I found it fascinating that the film included footage of Segal's transformed barn, now private museum... which has been un-acessible since his death in 2000. The filming of Segal's creations show the  life-size plaster sculptures of ordinary people doing ordinary things and it creates a deeply moving experience that I have not been exposed to yet.  The one thing that struck me the most was the filming presentation & discussion about his piece he did to commemorate the Holocaust.  Excellent & very insightful!",989625600,6,865,5.063380281690141
