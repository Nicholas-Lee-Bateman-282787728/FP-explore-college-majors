The amount of raw emotion that is expressed through simple movements is powerful, but also personal. The performance is strong and impressive in it's choreography and execution, but also slow and internal to allow for self-reflection and provide the viewer the opportunity to connect with the dancers and the message. Beautiful and powerful and important in all ways, I highly recommend this DVD.",1468800000,,476,5.115384615384615
