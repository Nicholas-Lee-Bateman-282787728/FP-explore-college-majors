8342650,4,B001U2QEQQ,"PRIDE FINAL CONFLICT ABSOLUTE was the climax of the last Pride Fighting Championships open-weight ""Grand Prix"" tournament, held on September 10, 2006 at the Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan. It composed the semifinal and final matches of the tourney, which had begun on May 5, 2006 with TOTAL ELIMINATION ABSOLUTE and continued on July 1 of that same year with CRITICAL COUNTDOWN ABSOLUTE. By this point in the Grand Prix, the field of fifteen original challengers had been narrowed to four legendary men - Mirko Cro Cop, Josh Barnett, Wanderlei Silva and Antoinio Rodrigo Nogueria. A pile of cash and a Grand Prix championship belt were awaiting the fighter who could best both his opponents on the same night, and all four guys had an added motivation to win. Cro Cop was looking for a championship to call his own after being a bridesmaid for most of his Pride career. Barnett, a former UFC heavyweight champion who'd been stripped of his title for failing a steroid test, was looking to redeem himself with that same belt. Wanderlei, the reigning Pride middlweight champ, had won a prior Grand Prix and was looking to repeat. And Nogueria wanted some hardware to replace the heavyweight title he'd lost in embarrassing fashion to Fedor Emilianenko.

As if this wasn't enough, the card also had six other fights, including a heavyweight battle between the heavy-hitting Russians (and blood enemies) Alexander Emilianenko and Sergei Kharitonov, a match between the grappler Ricardo Arona and the striker Alistair Ovareem, and a light heavyweight scrap featuring Shogun Rua versus Cyril Diabate. A pretty impressive list of fighters, many of whom are still in the mix today over in the UFC's title picture.

Obviously I am not going to spoil the outcomes, but I will say that overall this was a good card with plenty of action (much of it wicked-brutal) and some great storylines. There are always some clunker fights and others that are only so-so, but I was impressed by the fact that the semis and finals of the GP consisted of an all-star, legendary lineup, and that the competitors had to fight twice on the same night. This sort of thing has fallen out of vogue and isn't done anymore, but it truly separates the boys from the men, and my hat is definitely off to all the competitors...even though, in the end, there could be only one champion.",1348963200,,2356,4.843672456575683

8342652,5,B001U2QEQQ,This DVD is amazing I mean the Cro Cop vs Silva fight had me on the edge of my couch I mean here you have two of the greatest MMA fighers EVER fighting in the semifinal of the open weight grand prix tournamnet. Sadly neither fighers was ever the same after I trutly belive Silva's career came to an end in this fight while cro cop even tough he went all the way in the tournament for whatever reason was never the same after.,1254268800,,425,4.071428571428571
8342653,5,B001U2QEQQ,"Final Conflict is the final round of the 2006 PRIDE Fighting open-weight tournament.  We have the four semi-finalists: Wanderlei Silva, Mirko Cro Cop, Josh Barnett and Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira. Additional fighters featured on this card are Ricardo Arona, Alistair Overeem, Mauricio Shogun Rua, Sergei Kharitonov and Elaksander Emelianenko.  This event is packed with big names and solid action.

Though the event takes place a while after the PRIDE we all knew and loved began slowly falling apart, it retains some of the feel from the earlier events. Mauro Renallo and Frank Trigg on commentary can't really touch Bas and Quadros, but they do a decent job.

Wanderlei vs. Cro Cop: Wanderlei is again fighting well above his natural weight and faces an on-top-of-his-game Mirko Cro Cop. That aside, this is a great opportunity to see two of the biggest names in PRIDE face off once again, years after their initial PRIDE/K-1 meshed rules fight that introduced Cro Cop to PRIDE.

Josh Barnett vs. Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira: here we see a war between two of the world's premiere heavyweights.

Mauricio Shogun Rua vs. Cyrille Diabate: Shogun is back after his broken arm loss to Mark Coleman and it's great to see him healed up and back in action. Diabate is a lanky and talented striker, so this is an interesting one to watch.

I won't mention who fights in the tournament final, so as not to spoil the outcomes from the fights listed above, but it's a great night for one of these fighters...

Overall, this is a great event.  One of the last great PRIDE events, sadly. The DVD also includes additional fighter interview footage, as well as fighter walk-ins and two bonus fights.",1241481600,3,1679,4.883802816901408
8342654,5,B001U2QEQQ,"I've been a fan of MMA for years now and I can honestly say that this is one of the top two or three events I've seen.

The Cro Cop vs. Wanderlei Silva fight was one of the most brutal beatdowns I've seen in such a high profile match.

The Alexs Emelianenko vs. Sergei Kharitonov fight was good with a great finish.

Also the Shogun Rua vs. Cyrille ""The Snake"" Diabate fight was very entertaining.
Shogun was getting beaten standing up, but when he took The Snake down it was over shortly after.

I'm not sure how much Zuffa will edit this DVD from the original PPV broadcast I saw because the pre-fight show and fighter introductions were great as were the in ring entrances, but if you're an MMA fan and have purchased events on DVD in the past this would be one that I highly recommend buying.",1239580800,9,796,4.322147651006712
