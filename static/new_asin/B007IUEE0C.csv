5089869,4,B007IUEE0C,"My Son (8) is obsessed with tornadoes. It's not a passing one and he knows most of the scientific information behind them and weather patterns. I bought this for him and he loves it. The descriptive terms used in it could have been worded better. MY 8 year old had to ask me what ""The clouds were pregnant with tornadoes"" meant so I explained. There are graphic survival stories and death mentioned in this video so make sure you're child won't be scarred by it before you purchase.",1386288000,4,482,4.488636363636363
5089870,4,B007IUEE0C,"This video focuses on the 2011 tornado season in the U.S., considered extreme - killing over 550 people. The material covers efforts to improve warning systems, as well as construction. (The latter seems improbable, given the fact the DVD also reported that the Joplin hospital was moved 4"" off its foundation by the tornado that hit in 2011.)

However, I still don't understand how tornadoes are formed, nor whether their incidence is increasing or not. Would like to have seen more video shot from within tornadoes - the DVD had a few such clips but didn't explain their origin or other wise comment on them.",1370131200,2,610,4.809523809523809

5089872,5,B007IUEE0C,"I watched the original television program and was amazed at the resilience of the people who suffered the losses of 2011. This program by Nova is highly educational, showing the work of weather forecasters and their need for storm chasers, informs of the necessity of better early warning systems and reveals the deadly storms in action with devastating results. I really enjoyed the show and highly recommend it to educators and general public. Perhaps if we know more about this deadly force of nature, we can prevent the loss of human life in the future.",1334275200,3,557,4.873684210526315

8517911,5,B007IUEE0C,"Nova has been putting on programs about tornadoes since at least the mid 1980s and this one is another good one.  They interview a number of experts, including Gary England, long time TV weatherman and author of ""Weathering the Storm:  Tornadoes, Television and Turmoil"" and tornado research Howard Bluestein, author of ""Tornado Alley:  Monster Storms of the Great Plains"".

The show itself shows some beautiful footage of tornado alley, storms that are building into tornadoes -- sometimes!  you can never be certain when they'll come and when they won't out of a given thunderstorm.

And that is the main thing covered in this episode:  can they predict them earlier and help save lives?  Dr. Bluestein is shown with a new portable Doppler radar and we see his team in action.  We also see the tornadoes and the aftermath:  the tornado that savaged Joplin, MO in 2012 and an outbreak in Oklahoma that saw a number of twisters causing a lot of destruction, but less death, later that summer.

The quest goes on to understand them better and also to make safer structures more cheaply, so more of us can afford them.

Overall, a very good documentary on tornadoes.  I wish there were more programs on the weather -- all kinds of weather -- and so, for me, this was more than welcome.",1422748800,,1283,4.725225225225225

8517915,4,B007IUEE0C,"I  bought this for my hubby, a meterologist/oceanograpther. I pick up new info every time we watch it together. He compares this data to other info he has in his files. He also refers to a lot of this data on his website. It is also just plain fascinating from my layman's perspective.",1393372800,,285,4.377358490566038
