2748430,5,B000MTOM8U,"Instant Star is a Canadian television program starring Alexz Johnson as an adolescent music competition winner; she plays Jude Harrison. After its release, the program's popularity rose amongst teenagers, particularly in the United States and Canada.

The show chronicles Harrison's experience in the recording industry whilst focusing upon character development. In each episode of the show, Jude Harrison must deal with the problems and challenges of both her musical career and her personal life, as one weaves into the other.

In season 1, she faces dilemmas and choices in her relationships, dividing her feelings between the loves in her life, such as Tommy Q. (her producer/soul mate, who is played by the dreamy Tim Rozon), Jamie (a life-long best friend who is played by the charming Kristopher Turner ), and Shay (a major rap artist/ex boyfriend), while also recording with G-Major Records.

These people are important to her music - the one thread that ties her life together. Her best moments are when she is working with others in creating and performing her music. In addition to her music and her loves, there is a lot more going on in her personal life and in the lives of those around her.

Each episode of the series features a new song performed by Jude. Usually, the song is about something that occurs in the episode. However, in some episodes there are no direct explanation to the lyrics. Some episodes can feature more than one song, but there is only one song per episode that is to be featured on the soundtrack for that particular season. For instance, there are 13 episodes per season, therefore there are 13 main songs.

Alexz Johnson has done the vocals for Jude on both soundtracks that has been realesed so far, while even co-writing some of the songs with her brother Brendan.

The episodes from Season 1 are listed below;

Episode # 1: Even Better Than the Real Thing

2748448,5,B000MTOM8U,"I just rewatched this whole series for the first time in a few years since Netflix took it off so I have a lot of the details fresh in my brain. This was one of my all time favorite shows when I was a tween. The N had great teen shows and this was my favorite next to Degrassi before it became what it is now. Instant star is around a singing contest winner Jude Harrison making her first album and learning to live as a famous girl who also wants to live a normal life. It's a more grown up ""Hannah Montana"" She starts having feelings for her much older producer and that causes a lot of interesting problems and great music.

Musically this is probably one of my favorite seasons of this show. It has the classic songs us Instant Star know and love such as Skin,24 Hours, Waste My Time.  The best thing about this show for me is the drama, it has so much it deals with between family dysfunctions that happen to so many families while showing the music industry.",1446508800,2,964,4.205405405405405

2748475,5,B000MTOM8U,"Alexz Johnson for some reason I can not fathom has never become a big singing star.
I don't get it myself because she has a tremendous voice and was on Disney.
What happened?

Anyuway, this first season is all her and great . . .  except for the cliched first love interest.
I don't want to put spoilers but eeeewww and out of character.",1413072000,,337,4.25

I watched this show on tv when  it originally came out and new what episode should be next, it was absent. I found a list of the episodes and it is number 5 that is not there. I feel a little ripped off. The series was pretty in expensive and that was nice, but it would be nice if amazon made sure the complete series is there.",1321747200,3,431,4.070588235294117

2748500,5,B000MTOM8U,"This is the best show in the world. If you've never seen it, I would reccomend buying it. Its about a girl Jude Harrison who wins a talent contest, like American Idol, called Instant Star. She was the first ever Instant Star and its about her life, recording her cd, life, love. How hard it is when you fall in love with your producer and then he starts dating your sister. There is so much drama in this show. This is my favourite show in the world. The songs all have great meanings and Alexz Johnson is an amazing singer.
