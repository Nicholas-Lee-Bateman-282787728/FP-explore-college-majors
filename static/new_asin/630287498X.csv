522700,1,630287498X,"Poorly, poorly directed WWII drama involving the invasion of Norway by Germans and how it affected a small Norwegian town whose sort-of burgermeister is played sympathetically enough by Paul Muni.  He escapes to England by boat to marshall commando forces to liberate his town and destroy a planned airfield.  A Hollywood Norwegian is something to hear and see, women in embroidered bonnets and shawls and men with bleach blonde hair talking about the miracle of spawning salmon.  The action scene, the destruction of the airfield, had enough pyrotechnics to be exciting, but the director chose to sit way back and watch it, making the whole enterprise impossibly dull.",985651200,10,669,5.175925925925926
522711,4,630287498X,The movie is based in WW II Norway it starts as three English attending A wedding in A small Norway village then the war starts the Germans come and after awhile the people the people are tired what do by the Germans so they decided to fight back. The movie is really about A bunch of simple people who are tired of being bullied. The commandos are not in the film till the near end.,1423612800,,383,4.12
522712,3,630287498X,If for no other reason I liked this for Paul Muni's performance. I've seen Muni overact more than once... IMHO. But he seems very comfortable in this guy's skin and Muni's a master when he's got his game on. The film tells the story of a Norwegian fishing village. It's inhabitants and the effects of Nazi occupation in 1940. Nicely done.,1420416000,,338,4.557377049180328
522713,5,630287498X,"The first 80 percent of the movie is great:  good story, good actors, well filmed, etc.  The action at the end could have been more gripping.  Partly that's probably because we're used to films with much more ""action,"" i.e. special effects, which is not necessarily an improvement.  But there also did not seem to be much tension: you knew they were going to succeed, you knew they'd get out OK, and the ""surprise"" at the end was a bit weak.  It almost seemed as if the director had only maybe 15-20 minutes left to finish the film within his allotted 100 minutes; it would have been a lot better if he'd taken 10-15 minutes to make the ending as strong as the rest of the film.",1410566400,,678,4.349206349206349

522716,5,630287498X,"This World War II movie is worthy of a viewers time, attention and purchase.  All too often, it remains
an overlooked fact Scandinavian Countries were occupied by the Nazis - and Russia in Finland;
Sweden was neutral, but other nations were not.  Furthermore, Norwegians were heroic in their
resistance; the Allies on the British Isles were brave in sorties to keep Norway in the action.
Paul Muni's performance was outstanding to portray allied Commandos at its best. As Winston
Churchill reminded the rest of the world, in it relentless struggle to be free, "" ... look to Norway!""
I was very pleased with quality of this DVD, and the contents of the movie presentation.  For
anyone in search of a historical based novel about World War II Commandos in Norway, this
is the DVD to purchase.",1375401600,,790,4.794117647058823
522717,3,630287498X,"From 1942: This is mainly about a Norwegian citizen, and his grave misgivings toward the German occupation of his homeland, early in World War 2. I was hoping this would be a Commando-movie, but most of the focus is on the travails of the native resistance movement. However, theres a fairly impressive Commando-raid at the end, ...with a generous dose of tommy-gun shooting, grenade-hurling, close-combat Commando-action!

 Erik Toresen, like all patriots, decides to take action when a battalion of Wehrmacht troops takes up residence in his small fishing village. Assembling a group of like-minded loyal Norwegians, they conduct sabotage and reconnaissance against the occupation force within the limits of their resources and abilities. Discovering that a major Luftwaffe air-base is under construction nearby, Toresen and a several volunteers make a desperate attempt to sail to Britain to warn them of the new threat to Allied shipping route to Russia.

Realizing that something must be done immediately at this fragile time for the Allies, the Brits launch a Commando raid with Toresen acting as local guide for the raiding-force. By Jove, they gave those Jerries a good sound thashing!",1369872000,,1193,5.335106382978723

522719,4,630287498X,"It us interesting to here the word Propaganda tossed around by a bunch of folks that were not even born in 1942
Had no experience of the trauma occurring then and the lives lost by so many people to preserve our Freedom.
I would suggest that the folks that fluff off that great tragedy called World War 11 crack a book on its history
or if you can find a soldier that is still alive and sit down an talk to him or her.
Propaganda? We were fighting for our lives at the time. As a American I make no apologies for what we did to
save our freedom so the people making comments today can only see this film a Propaganda.
Louis Sisbarro a free American! I am 74 years old and was there when it happen.

522720,5,630287498X,"This is a very realistic happening. A reasionably small village , reacts to the terror of Nazi occupation. The honest peaceful town folk, react in ways that seem so very real and appropiate. In trying to succede in ridding themselves of the horrors of the INVADERS. I can understand how alone and helpless some could feel in an almost hopeless situation. This is in my opinion an excellent viewing.

522731,5,630287498X,"This is a family favorite because some of it was filmed in  the British Columbia ""fiords"".  My Uncle's Canadian Navy ship was used and my uncle has a brief speaking part. It is interesting for those of us who were too young to remember WWII to see a depiction of the occupation of a part of rural Norway by the Germans. WAR!: ""Lest we forget"", as they say. I am now watching the engaging FOYLE'S WAR series.  That sheds some light on the plight of the English during the war. I would love to see THE LAST VICEROY out on DVD. That series was a great history lesson as well.",1310515200,,572,4.181818181818182
522732,3,630287498X,"Commandos Strike at Dawn, 1942 film

This movie is dedicated to the soldiers of Canada, Great Britain, and Norway. The story begins at a rural village in Norway. There is a wedding celebration. [Note the traditional dress of the bride.] People enjoy a peaceful life. The conversations tell about the people. The radio brings news of the War. Germany attacks Poland, invades Denmark, then occupies Norway. ""No more resistance"" are the orders which must be followed by all. Germany is creating a ""New World Order"" and will protect the Norwegians. Those who don't follow orders will be shot. ""What does `questioning' mean?"" Nazi troops march into the village. Radios are confiscated, as well as blankets and other goods. One fisherman is shot. People can do nothing. [What about rations?] Little children are taught new lessons in school. Young men 17 to 25 are conscripted to work in the Narvik mines.

Can the Norwegians strike back against the enemy? Will they destroy bridges? Or give the wrong directions? Those who listen to a radio are shot in public as a warning to the others. Will there be retribution from the ""bad people"" in the village? Eric flees to a remote farmhouse. Can he hide from the searching Germans? Will five hostages be shot in reprisal? Eric sees airplanes at an isolated pasture. Can he escape to England? Is there a traitor among the resistance? Is there a trick to trace people with a dog whistle? A woman warns Eric about Lars the innkeeper. ""I'm in the same boat as you."" ""Why did you do it?"" ""Help!"" The small open boat sails through a storm to reach England. The Norwegian Government-in-exile will inspect them. Eric tells about the aerodrome. Can he lead the English Commandos to attack it? The aerodrome can attack convoys to Murmansk.

A ship transports the troops to a Norwegian fjord. They will attack the aerodrome and return to the ship. They pray before departure. Soldiers climb over the side into a landing ship. ""Good hunting!"" The sergeants carry Tommy guns for short range combat. There is an artillery duel. The soldiers form up to return to the ship. Where is Eric's daughter? Can she be rescued? There is shooting and casualties, but people are rescued. ""We will come back."" The flags of the United Nations are shown at the end. (How many can you recognize?)

You can see a softer edge to this earlier movie compared to alter WW II movies. Until the invasion of Italy in 1943 the Allied Forces could only launch isolated attacks (such as Dieppe) against an entrenched enemy. Strategic bombing was used to attack the factories that produced fighter planes and ball bearings, or the oil fields of Rumania.",1306972800,,2650,4.8048245614035086
522733,4,630287498X,I have been trying to find this movie on DVD for a long time. It is a classic ww2 story that illustrates the resistance of the Norwegian people. Very good movie.,1287532800,,161,4.225806451612903

522735,3,630287498X,"Made in the 1940's while WWII was still happening, this movie is very typical of the ones made during that time period. One part love story, one part actioneer, and one part propaganda they all start out with a peaceful life that is interrupted by the bad Axis guys. (in this case the Nazis). When pushed to far, everyone fights back and it builds up to a climactic end. Always ending on a note of hope because no one really knew how the war would end at that time.",1260835200,,465,4.235955056179775
522736,3,630287498X,"With a story by Hornblower creator C.S. Forrester and a screenplay by future doorstop novelist Irwin Shaw, 1942's Commandos Strike at Dawn is a solid but overlong wartime propaganda picture that benefits from a good location (Canada standing in for Norway, giving it a similar feel to parts of 49th Parallel), a strong cast (an understated Paul Muni, Ray Collins, Lillian Gish, Cedric Hardwicke and the ever likeable Robert Coote among them, while Alexander Knox does double duty as a cold Nazi and the voice of the commandos' padre delivering a pre-raid sermon) but ultimately just takes too long to get where its going. Certainly the commando raid itself is a long time coming and not particularly excitingly mounted despite obvious extensive cooperation from the Canadian armed forces, although the last few minutes are almost staged as a pure western with commandos and Nazis instead of cowboys and Indians. En route it understandably overplays the acts resistance for morale-boosting purposes, but it the first half is elevated by some of the always-undervalued director John Farrow's typically complicated but unostentatious long tracking shots. For classical music buffs, Igor Stravinsky's Four Norwegian Moods was based on his rejected score for the film, replaced here by a more overtly stirring Oscar-nominated effort by Louis Gruenberg and an uncredited John Leipold.",1194307200,5,1378,5.354838709677419
522737,4,630287498X,"As a dad, I found this film, though dated and quaint, both a stirring old war movie that boys will like as well as a good opportunity to teach some strategic realities.  There are bad people in the world, they make promises and break them and they strive to enslave good people; for the sake of civilization good people often need to do otherwise bad things like fight and even kill.  Rough stuff, but this is the fallen nature of this world.",1135555200,9,442,4.378048780487805
522738,4,630287498X,"Hollywood's first reaction to the United States' entry into World War II usually took one of two forms.  In the Pacific Theater the movie typically chronicled a valiant, but doomed, defense.  Wake Island and Bataan were popular movies of early defeat.  When Hollywood turned its attention to the European Theater its early movies celebrated indigenous resistance against Nazism by the intrepid citizens of nations like Czechoslovakia, or, in the case of COMMANDOS STRIKE AT DAWN, Norway.

  Paul Muni stars as Eric Toresen, a soft-spoken, pacifistic civil servant whose initial response to the German occupation of the small town he lives in is rather detached.  ""We civilians,"" he explains, haven't a right to interfere and oppose the military occupation.  ""This is not exactly our line.""  Of course, the occupiers are busy rounding up suspected subversives, imposing their doctrine in the local schools, and confiscating personal property for use in the Fatherland.  Before long Toresen realizes that `we must learn from them to become gangsters and thugs.'  When Toresen discovers a military airfield being built nearby,  he plans to sail to England and organize a commando force to destroy it before it becomes operational.

  Muni gives a typically good, understated performance as a gentle man caught in vicious times.  Although it contains a quisling or two, COMMANDOS STRIKE AT DAWN fulfills its purpose - explaining to Americans why we fight and generally ennobling the heroic freedom fighters in Nazi occupied Europe.  A strong recommendation for this early entry in World War II movies.",1117411200,24,1597,5.298804780876494
522739,4,630287498X,"This movie was made in 1942, and made use of the HMCS Prince David which was on leave from thrashing around in the Aleutians looking for the Japanese.  My father was an officer on that ship at the time, and thoroughly enjoyed the cast, especially Sir Cecil Hardwicke.  I've watched the movie, and of course it is propaganda, it was made in 1942.  That is part of its charm.  Remember that at the time, no one knew who would win the war.  Vancouver Island makes a good stand in for Norway, and Paul Muni is some brave! It is superior propaganda  and a fun experience.",1079568000,16,566,4.3428571428571425
522740,4,630287498X,"This WWII film does have a certain aspect of propaganda to it, but the tense storyline is riveting and will keep you glued to your chair until the last scene (which isn't exactly what you'll be expecting).

7832232,4,630287498X,Interesting character studies of people used to democracy but forced to live under Nazi occupation. Surprisingly honest exploration of moral dilemmas as well as physical sacrifices involved in resistance. Combat sequences more problematic.,1469923200,,239,6.2727272727272725

7832235,5,630287498X,"As another review observed, this was made long before anyone knew how WWII would end.  I found the attempt to capture Norwegian ""atmospherics"" charming, even though it's filmed in Canada.  (Couldn't film in Norway, obviously.)

7832238,5,630287498X,"I can' t really remember wether I saw this as a small boy in the cinema during the early 1940's, but knowing me, I saw as many as I could, getting in the cinemas was no problem. It was shown here on tv before the event of the home video recorders, so I haven't seen it, until some weeks ago when a very nice print (Columbia Pictures always looked after their prints) was on tv. Of course, I checked to see if it had been done on dvd and lo and behold, it was available from Amazon.com.  All the reviews given on this site have been good positive ones on the picture.  I reiterate every one. Paul Muni gave a very good interpretation of passive ideals to war and occupation, until finally provoked into action like many people in real life at that dreadful time, as the Nazis stormed over Europe. Muni was a bit before my time to appreciate his earlier career at Warner Bros, however I enjoyed this performance, and the performances of all the other actors, a few minutes of  Lloyd Bridges, going from this film, to (Rocketship XM ) then to a great career. An early film role for a fairly big part  in this film, for Richard Derr to ( When Worlds Collide ) but didn't really make a big film career. Of course the other major actors don't need any introduction to film goers.
I recommend this dvd to anyone that likes war drama, war adventure, or an emotional story of a desperate people that, in real life, would have been frightening to say the least..I will watch this film on a regular basis now I have acquired this dvd.  DVD quality, as expected from Columbia Pictures, an excellent picture and sound.
