8124116,3,B000FKP10Y,"This DVD's great glory is its color ""footage"" of battlefield terrain at the Little Bighorn battlefield.

This DVD's battlefield footage provides an impression of the ""deceptive"" rolling terrain, covered in ""buffalo"" grass, in which infiltrating Indian warriors concealed themselves - key elements in the rapid collapse of Custer's battalion.

From an academic perspective, a ""fault"" in this DVD is the artistic ""license"" this DVD often takes, to create dramatic effect.  This seriously impairs its credibility, with the result that a viewer never knows whether assertions made are accurate or not.  This type of ""fault"" is generic in most ""Hollywood"" ""historical"" films.  However, this DVD is presented as an academic production, not as a ""Hollywood"" production.

A ""dramatic effects"" theme this DVD initially takes, as a premise, is the supposed great mystery of the diametric views of Custer's true character.  A number of statements made are either presumptuous, inaccurate, or hyperbolic.  This DVD contains good information relating to this ""mystery"" issue from which, if true, inferences can be made by this DVD, but are not.

This DVD is a mixture of ""biography"" (of Custer), and of history, regarding the ultimate theme of the ""Showdown at Little Big Horn.""

There is much of quality and merit in this DVD, including commentary by a number of living native Americans (i.e., Indians). This DVD's attempt to present, understand, and honor this unique Indian perspective is pure gold.

To me, this DVD's great revelation - not stated, addressed or acknowledged in this DVD - is that, in addition to Custer's character, Custer's combat experience in the Civil War may have been decisive in Custer's conduct at the Little Bighorn.  However, this DVD presents Custer's experience in the Civil War as generic biography, without attempting to analyze that experience for answers for Custer's military performance at the Little Bighorn.

An ultimate issue of this DVD is Custer's tactical performance at the Little Bighorn.  On this issue, Custer's conduct in the Civil War is relevant. The perspective this DVD offers indicates that Custer's performances in command during the Civil War were limited to TACTICALLY UNSOPHISTICATED, impetuous, head-on frontal cavalry charges.

This DVD also indicates that during Civil War battles, Custer operated as a subordinate officer of relatively minor cavalry units subordinate to larger military formations, where the tactical decisions were made by higher-level officers and staff, as is usually the case.  This DVD also notes that when attending West Point, Custer graduated 34th in his class of 34, which does not indicate or inspire confidence in Custer's possible potential for sound tactical judgment.

During the Little Bighorn battle, Custer failed - in glaringly elementary, fundamental ways - as a tactician, e.g.:

(1) Custer conducted no meaningful reconnaissance (i.e., Custer made his tactical dispositions, and entered the battle area, blind); (2) Custer divided his ""command"" into three separate battalions (with one additional company guarding the ""pack"" horses), which battalions were not in MUTUALLY SUPPORTING DISTANCE of each other; and (3) and Custer did not DISTRIBUTE HIS SURPLUS (RESERVE) AMMUNITION (from the ""pack"" horses) before Custer proceeded with his attack.

This DVD illustrates the ""reserve"" ammunition issue by a written note Custer sent to Benteen, after Custer sighted the Indian village, BELATEDLY requesting - as an AFTERTHOUGHT - that the ""pack"" horses with the 7th Cavalry's reserve ammunition be brought up from the rear.

One of this DVD's historians - who describes Custer as HEROIC and COURAGEOUS at the Battle of the Little Bighorn (something NO ONE can know) - identifies the location of the two bullet holes on Custer's corpse.  I have read that EITHER of these two bullet holes could have been SELF-INFLICTED by Custer upon himself.  This DVD supports this conclusion.  When fighting Indians, ""SAVE YOUR LAST BULLET FOR YOURSELF.""

There have been more books written about the battle of the Little Bighorn THAN ANY OTHER U.S. BATTLE, except Gettysburg.  This DVD could have taken ""mystery"" of this dynamite and fascinating material and resolved aspects of the Custer ""mystery' in the DVD - particularly by discussing the archaeological evidence revealed by the 1985-1086 archaeological project at the Custer battlefield, which this DVD did not do.

NOTE (July 14, 2012).  For AMAZON.com customers seeking specifics of Custer's Last Stand, I absolutely do not recommend PBS's new (2012) DVD entitled CUSTER'S LAST STAND (AMERICAN EXPERIENCE), a 2-hour DVD which DOES NOT in fact deal with Custer's Last Stand, other than providing (admittedly excellent) background information - e.g., the Battle of the Washita, the Battle of the Rosebud, Sitting Bull, and the Black Hills expedition.

I am not aware of a DVD which provides meaningful specific treatment about Custer's Last Stand.  However, I do recommend a book by Richard Allen Fox entitled ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CUSTER'S LAST BATTLE (1993), which has the great merit of discussing the bonanza of archaeological evidence discovered during a 1984-1985 archeological dig at the Custer battlefield, together with excellent new understandings and interpretations this archaeological material offers regarding ""Custer's"" last battle - interpretations which dispel many major (if not ultimate) myths and ongoing misunderstandings of this battle.  This objective book does not portray Custer in a negative light, but shows that at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Custer and his regimental staff functioned in a rational if flawed manner, operating in accordance with established U.S. cavalry tactical prescriptions - radicalizing revelations which were an enormous surprise to me, which I believe are valid, and which significantly altered my life-long perception of Custer's performance at the Little Bighorn.

ADDENDUM (August 10, 2014):  The foregoing review represents my understanding at the time of its posting (October 9, 2011).  Since writing the forgoing ""customer review,"" I repurchased Richard Allen Fox's book entitled ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CUSTER'S LAST BATTLE: THE LITTLE BIGHORN REEXAMINED.  Carefully re-reading Fox's book caused me to radically revise my understanding of Custer's Last Stand, and of the battlefield performance of Custer himself.  Never before in my life had I experienced such a radical transformation of such a vehement, long-held belief, as that of my opinion of Custer's performance at the Little Bighorn!

I had always thought, for nearly a half a century, that Custer was a complete and incomprehensible idiot at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.  However, Fox's book shows that that the command elements of Custer's battalion were performing ""by the book,""  in an understandable and responsible manner, prior to the battalion's collapse.  Based on Fox's book, I do not see how anyone could have anticipated what happened to Custer's battalion at the Little Bighorn. True, archeology indicates that most of the troopers of Custer's battalion did not show much courage (goodby, ""Custer Myth"") - but if I had been with Custer's battalion that day, I wouldn't have either.

""GREEN"" TROOPS?:  Fox's book details certain battlefield behavior of Custer's troops - e.g., ""bunching behavior"" - that has been subsequently observed in later battlefield studies in more recent wars.  In this regard, I have always suspected that a significant portion of Custer's battalion consisted of ""green"" troops (some were in their teens), inexperienced in actual combat.  The combat behavior of ""green"" troops dispels the portrayal of staunch, heroic combat behavior depicted in the ""Custer Myth.""

I am not deleting the forgoing ""customer review,"" as it represents my beliefs and understanding at the time, beliefs I had held all of my life, and some of which I still hold.  For a radical update of my understanding of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, please see my review of Richard Allen Fox's book entitled ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CUSTER'S LAST BATTLE: THE LITTLE BIGHORN REVISITED, posted here on AMAZON on July 17, 2012.",1318118400,5,8224,5.392801251956182
