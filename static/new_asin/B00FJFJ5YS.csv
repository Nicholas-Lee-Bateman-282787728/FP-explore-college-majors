5993508,4,B00FJFJ5YS,The best worst movie I have ever seen. Awesomely bad in every way.,1420329600,,66,4.153846153846154
5993509,5,B00FJFJ5YS,"Absolutely batshit crazy , loved it.",1417651200,,36,5.166666666666667
5993510,1,B00FJFJ5YS,"This movie is so stupid and rediculous, not scary at all. The other people that wrote rave reviews about it must have been paid a bundle to say good things about it! Their is nothing worth watching about this movie. The picture was also very bad, looks like it was bootlegged. This movie is a waste of time and money, a big disappointment!",1394668800,3,339,4.396825396825397
5993511,4,B00FJFJ5YS,"Having heard of one of these movies for years, I was excited to be able to finally see it.  It does not disappoint!  Low budget, terrible looking, bad quality transfer (it literally looks like a VHS tape being played on a machine that needs the heads cleaned and aligned) but good lord... A ventriloquists dummy rapes a highly religious woman and all of a sudden, she's the biggest whore in the world.  But none can satisfy her like the Black Devil Doll from Hell!!",1390348800,11,465,4.511904761904762
5993512,5,B00FJFJ5YS,"Got this as a gift for my boyfriend, and everything about it is so low-budget that it looks like someone's home movie filmed on a camcorder.  The special effects are hilarious!  The best part of this movie, though, is the devil doll's voice!",1388880000,8,241,4.5813953488372094
5993513,4,B00FJFJ5YS,I bought this set only for the reason of placing it next to the other 6 massacre videos that have been released.  massacre really knows how to put a low budget movie into a great package. if you like to collect or hoard movies then these are for u.  they are about as nice a set as you can get without going into hard boxes and clamshells. Well as for the movies themselves I have watched them.  I can honestly say I've sat through worse but its been awhile.  miss jones breasts kept me occupied through the last half bddfh.  Tales was a step better.  the four stars is really for the collectors piece it is.,1385078400,9,608,4.198275862068965
5993514,5,B00FJFJ5YS,"Great to have these films available on legitimate dvd's with bonus features.  BDDFH is one of the most insane movies ever.  It blows my mind that this movie actually exists.  I've had bootleg versions of both films for quite some time now.  It's great to finally see Chester N. Turner and Shirley L. Jones in a bonus documentary talking about all this insanity.  They actually seem like pretty down to earth folks.  Chester names Rod Serling and Alfred Hitchcock as major influences.  Makes sense I guess.  The picture quality is pretty bad here, but that's to be expected.  These films were shot on video in the 1980's.  Tales From The Quadead Zone has grown on me over the years.  It may not be as off the wall as Black Devil Doll From Hell, but I feel it is probably the better of the two films.

In these two films we've got puppet sex, a long puppet tongue, some hilarious dialogue, a guy dressing up a corpse in a clown outfit, a redneck family that doesn't realize they can cut sandwiches in half to share them, and a very unprofessional Casio synth soundtrack that often plays loudly over top of the actors talking.  There's not much more to life than these films.  This set is worth checking out for the extras alone.  The documentary included is great and there is also audio commentary for both films.  If you are a fan that only owns bootlegs, it's worth upgrading for these features.",1384992000,16,1396,4.524
5993515,1,B00FJFJ5YS,WOW ! ! !  It looks terrible. I have a dvd-r recorded from the old vhs that looks better than this. The dvd has a flutter at the top portion of the screen which could have been prevented if good equipment was used to copy the vhs to dvd when they made the master.,1384992000,6,263,3.8703703703703702
5993516,2,B00FJFJ5YS,"I haven't watched ""Tales From The Quadead Zone"" yet, but ""Black Devil Doll From Hell"", is supposedly transferred from Chester N. Thompson's personal VHS copy which is the best source material available.  It looks just like the worn-out copy of this I had on VHS that I found at the flea market years ago.  If you like reliving the olden days of watching a worn VHS tape, where the image wavers & everything looks grainy & off-color, then you'll like this just fine.  If you were hoping for something actually remastered & cleaned up, you're in for a big disappointment.  The boxset LOOKS nice, but nobody bothered with making sure the actual content looked nice, so for the price, this is really not worth it.  Very disappointing.",1384646400,10,730,4.716535433070866

8616070,1,B00FJFJ5YS,I rated it 1 star because I could not submit a review without selecting a star. If I could select negative stars I would have. I like movies that are so terrible it's funny. But this movie is so terrible I think it broke my DVD player. Please don't waste your money. I'm probably the only fool that bought this disc of doo doo.,1475107200,,327,4.125

8616072,1,B00FJFJ5YS,AVOID and save your money. Two un-watchable pieces of crap that vhs hipsters are trying to build into the holy grail of bad movies. These movies suck plain and simple and the quality of the dvd is nonexistent. Massacre video release nothing but s***e.,1456012800,,251,4.7272727272727275

8616074,1,B00FJFJ5YS,This is one of the WORST copies I've ever seen. The picture quality is HORRIBLE. The movie looks like it was taken from and OLD video copy. Its scrolls nearly all the way through! Impossible to watch. Oh well here's another seller that got the best of me. Hope you heed my warning about this DVD. Do Not Buy This!,1436918400,3,313,4.233333333333333
8616075,5,B00FJFJ5YS,"If you're a fan of shot-on-video horror ""Black Devil Doll From Hell"" is a CLASSIC! It's so bad it's GREAT. It has to be seen to be believed.",1423180800,,140,4.035714285714286
