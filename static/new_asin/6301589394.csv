7813871,5,6301589394,"I loved it.  I was expecting the worst because it was made in the late 40s (I thought Cantor would be too old to dance), but Cantor was grand!  So were Sen. Murphy and Joan Davis.  The jokes kept coming, really funny ones, and everyone's delivery was perfect.  I cried at the happy ending - I'm easy - though the plot wasn't so much.  Joan Davis and Eddie Cantor were paired for the jokes, Murphy and Constance Moore (who starred opposite Ray Bolger in Rodgers and Hart's last completely original show ""By Jupiter"" in 1942) were the lovers.  It has a few serious moments.  That's okay.  I thought it was a great comedy (because the jokes were good) and an equally great musical (because Cantor and Murphy and the songs were good).",1407801600,,730,4.4772727272727275

Eddie Cantor is always good for some quick wit and while many younger people would dismiss it as being old fashioned and irrelevant, it show how good life could be. Show business does not have to be vulgar to get the message across.",1389312000,,313,4.322033898305085

7813874,4,6301589394,"SHOW BUSINESS, produced by and starring Eddie Cantor, is his personal valentine to vaudeville and ""show folks."" Cantor and director Edwin L. Marin do a nice job capturing the theatrical world of the early 20th century, with the ambition, perseverance, and easy backstage familiarity common to most variety performers. The story focuses on six principals: George Murphy is the worldly star who takes amateur Eddie Cantor under his wing; Constance Moore and Joan Davis are musical-comedy entertainers who are swept along by Murphy's constant big ideas; Nancy Kelly is the jealous soubrette out to snare Murphy; and Don Douglas is the affable agent who rides with the various career ups and downs. Overall it's a very good show.

Cantor re-creates his old show-stoppers with  panache (including ""Makin' Whoopee"") and indulges in his usual fresh-kid/timid-boyfriend comedy. Davis works just as hard, enhancing her wisecracking dialogue with her physical-comedy skills. Cantor and Davis worked so well together that they became close offscreen during the filming, and the relationship went wrong before the film was finished. Unfortunately, this shows in the film: in some scenes Eddie and Joan are cute and chummy, and in others there is a noticeable coolness (Eddie even laughs contemptuously at her, which the actress wasn't expecting). Fans desiring a window into Eddie Cantor's private personality may pick up on the Cantor-Davis dynamic here.

The first half of the film is a joy, with Cantor and company energetically singing, dancing, and clowning their way to the top. Then the film goes dramatic, with Murphy and Moore shattered by a marital tragedy. Although the dramatic scenes are well played (including a surprisingly sober turn by brassy comedienne Claire Carleton), the film doesn't completely re-establish the tone of its good-time first act. Producer Cantor filmed so much material that some of it had to be deleted before release, which may explain the rather sudden shift in tone. The film as he delivered it is still solid entertainment, with a great cast of familiar faces in bit roles (Dick Elliott, Eddie Borden, Robert Homans, George Lloyd, Myrna Dell, and a host of others).

SHOW BUSINESS was RKO's biggest hit of 1944 and it had a long life in theatrical and television revivals. The Warner Archive DVD-R is superior to the usual ""television"" version familiar since the 1950s, with sharper and brighter picture quality. If you like vintage musicals and/or Eddie Cantor, you'll like this.",1302739200,10,2510,5.236318407960199
7813875,4,6301589394,"A nearly forgotten delight from 1944. In the colourful era of belles-in-bloomers-and beer-in-buckets, trouped ambitious groups of loveable hams known as show folks, all dreaming of the Big Time. A truly entertaining, zestfully enacted excursion into an era long past, this movie has long been considered one of the best dealing with its title. In 1914, vaudevillian Eddie Martin (Cantor) meets up with a hoofer George Doane (George Murphy): together they work on the stage where Eddie wins first prize. The boys go celebrate at Kelly's Cafe, where they meet two dames played by Constance Ford & the hilariously vivacious Joan Davis...Naturally, there is much more to this fun-filled nostalgic-flavoured film - which was based in part on Cantor's own career - it remains unjustly nearly forgotton. The film's theme is Gus Kahn's IT HAD TO BE YOU & there was an entertaining 1948 sequel also starring Cantor & Davis entitled IF YOU KNEW SUSIE.",1045958400,10,941,5.077419354838709
