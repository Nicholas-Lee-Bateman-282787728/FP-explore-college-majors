3123453,5,B00145CRB0,"The movie serial peaked during the days of silent film, and French Director Louis Feuillade was an important part of that blossoming. I have seen two of his thrillers, Les Vampires and Judex, and found both wonderful. Now comes Fantomas, the 5-part adventures of a master criminal and his nemesis, Inspector Juve. Kino has done its usual fine job with the films, and has included audio commentary and a pair of Feuillade's short films. Highly recommended.",1294099200,6,455,5.0
3123454,4,B00145CRB0,"One of the more fascinating aspects of this movie is the detailed and rich presentation of life at the turn of the century: dress, hairdos, cars, living spaces (the hotel lobby for instance) and more.  How could people dress the way they did...?
Second aspect is the naivete of the so-called formidable evil of Fantomas; what's the big deal?  Anybody looking for evidence of the erosion of our sensibilities, this movie could serve as a landmark.",1288396800,5,446,4.855263157894737
3123455,5,B00145CRB0,"French film pioneer Louis Feuillade's 1913 groundbreaking, epic crime thriller FANTOMAS is a captivating viewing experience. This five part series was based on the popular French pulp novels of the day and served as the prototype for all future films in this vein, including Feuillade's own brilliant follow up LES VAMPIRES and Fritz Lang's terrific DR. MABUSE saga.

The intrigue is all very intricately presented with the title master criminal assuming several different identities along the way in order to throw the authorities off his track. FANTOMAS has a neatly mixed atmosphere of fantasy and realism, with its outrageous premise being played out in and around the streets of Paris before the outbreak of World War 1. This is partly what makes these films so fascinating to watch today.

Presented with an effective music score by Catalougue Sonimage and an informative commentary by historian David Kalat, Kino's beautiful restoration preserves FANTOMAS so that modern viewers can better appreciate Feuillade's innovative masterpiece.",1288310400,14,1043,5.472049689440993
3123456,5,B00145CRB0,"Just like its eponymous antagonist towering over Paris at dusk, Fantmas looms over the thriller genre, presaging the work of Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock, and countless others.  A series of five films produced in France during 1913-14 by Louis Feuillade, ""Fantmas"" reflected the era's fascination with outlandish criminal masterminds and nudged the thriller genre into realms of surrealism and poetic sadism.  The films are linked together by virtue of the characters, but each can be enjoyed on its own terms.
Part One, ""In the Shadow of the Guillotine,"" introduces the basic dynamic between arch-fiend Fantmas and the duo obsessively devoted to bringing him to justice, Juve of the Sret and his loyal sidekick, the reporter Fandor.  Fantmas quickly demonstrates his defining characteristics, an uncanny ability to assume new identities and an utter ruthlessness.  His exploitation of the character of Lady Beltham borders on the vampiric.  The second film, ""Juve vs. Fantmas"" is a fever dream of pulpish delights including a train wreck, a gun battle culminating in an inferno, and a killer boa constrictor.  It concludes with Fantmas blowing up the house with the two protagonists still inside and their fates unknown.  Much of Part Three, ""The Murderous Corpse,"" plays like a fin-de-sicle police procedural as the authorities step up their investigative efforts, and the subsequent film, ""Fantmas vs. Fantmas,"" ratchets up the surrealism with a bleeding wall and a costumed ball attended by three guests dressed as Fantmas.  The final film, ""The False Magistrate,"" offers the viewer the best opportunity to observe the villain's methods as he assumes the identity of a judicial official and abuses the position for his own nefarious gains.
Modern viewers may find devoting five-and-a-half hours to watch a silent French serial to be unreasonable: the camera remains largely motionless and scenes play themselves out with only a modicum of edits.  Those approaching Fantmas with patience and an open mind will be amply rewarded.  Images become like a tableau and linger in the mind.  Like Feuillade's other thrillers, ""Les Vampires"" and ""Judex,"" ""Fantmas"" takes on the texture of a filmed dream, almost like an ""Inception"" made a century earlier.  Identities are exchanged and abandoned with ease while motives and intentions remain unclear.
The films generally look exceptionally good for their age although portions of ""The False Magistrate"" are lost and replaced with descriptions and a still photograph.  While visually pleasing, the musical score, drawn from a French music library, presents some minor issues.  Many of the cues selected compliment the action on screen, but in other instances the music overplays the menace or the comedy.  Also certain vocal pieces and occasional sound effects (gunshots, applause, etc.) are distracting and reminiscent of budget-priced DVD releases.  The exemplary work done by composer Robert Israel on ""Les Vampires"" and ""Judex"" is greatly missed here.  This is a minor quibble given the overall excellence of the restoration and the supplementary features included by Kino.  In addition to a still gallery is an audio commentary by film scholar David Kalat on the first two films.  Kalat provided one of the most informative and entertaining commentaries I've ever listened to for Image's release of ""Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler"" and he brings the same insight and enthusiasm to this project.  Fuelliade's directorial versatility is demonstrated by a ten-minute film on his career and a pair of short films, ""The Nativity"" (1910) and  ""The Dwarf"" (1912).
Overall it's a fantastic set that belongs in the collection of anyone with an interest in early cinema, pulp thrillers, or great storytelling.",1285459200,42,3740,5.348122866894198
3123457,5,B00145CRB0,"For those of you not familiar with Louis Feuillade, he was the artistic director of France's Gaumont Studios from 1907-1918 during which time he directed or supervised over 800 films. He is best remembered today for his groundbreaking crime serials FANTOMAS, JUDEX, and LES VAMPIRES which still have the power to amaze and entertain almost 100 years later. FANTOMAS is the earliest of the three dating from 1913-14. It is the blueprint for countless crime serials that would follow where an archcriminal who is a master of disguise and head of a vast criminal empire (Fantomas) is doggedly pursued by a dedicated ""supercop"" (Inspector Juve) and his sidekick (Fandor) who are determined to bring him down.

FANTOMAS was conceived on a grand scale. It breaks down into five films (IN THE SHADOW OF THE GUILLOTINE, JUVE-vs-FANTOMAS, THE MURDEROUS CORPSE, FANTOMAS-vs-FANTOMAS, THE FALSE MAGISTRATE) and runs for over 5 1/2 hours. It is full of disguises, surprises, several comic moments, a touch of the supernatural and surprising brutality. It's also a time capsule of settings and life before World War One which makes it invaluable as history. Rene Navarre and Edmond Breon as protagonist and antagonist give surprisingly restrained (and effective) performances considering that this film was made in 1913. Be warned, once you start it, it's hard to stop watching, even if you're not into silent films.

Although it was the first to be made, FANTOMAS is the last of three great Feuillade serials to make it to Region One DVD. LES VAMPIRES and JUDEX have been available for a few years now and if you haven't seen them you should check them out as well. Gaumont did the restoration back in 1998 and the film looks astonishing for its age. It was first released on Region 2 DVD in the U.K. by Artificial Eye back in 2006. This edition comes with an entertaining and appropriate music score as well as special features that include 2 short Feuillade films as well as commentary from film historian David Kalat. Thanks to Kino Lorber for finally making it available in the USA so that Americans can it enjoy it as well.",1283731200,61,2116,4.891364902506964
3123458,5,B00145CRB0,"""Fantomas"" is an early action/suspense series in five 1-hour episodes filmed in France in the years 1913-14, when cinema was just becoming a celebrated art and form of entertainment in its own right.  For this reason alone I was already very impressed to see such sophistication and style in an early version of today's TV serials, complete with heroes and villains creating thrills and spills throughout every episode.  Based on popular pulp novels of that time, prolific film-maker Louis Feuillade created one of the first crime dramas for the screen with a lively, original spontaneity that is still palpable when watching it close to a century later.  Best remembered for the two crime drama serials he produced in following years, namely ""Les Vampires"" (1915) and ""Judex"" (1917) which became longer and more complex each time, ""Fantomas"" is refreshingly shorter and less involved, but still full of fascinating characters, thrilling action and enthralling twists and turns.  The overall style is more of a comic book villain rather than a realistic crime drama, but this served as exciting and even avant-garde entertainment at the time, and is no less fascinating in our day.

Fantomas is the villain who, like his name implies, appears and disappears like a phantom, thanks to various clever disguises.  Many of the situations are implausible, yet the way in which it is captured on screen makes for breathtaking suspense and surprises which are not easily forgotten.  Even the street scenes, houses and fashions of these years create a charm and enchantment as one feels transported back into another time and era.  Adding to all these outstanding features are the top quality orchestral music accompaniment and overall excellent condition of the film itself.  There is also a 40-minute feature with Kim Newman who provides helpful background information to ""Fantomas"" and Louis Feuillade in order to appreciate this amazing early serial even more.  Anyone who enjoyed ""Les Vampires"" and ""Judex"" should add ""Fantomas"" to complete their Louis Feuillade collection, and anyone with a yearning for something completely different from another time and place also won't be disappointed!",1234224000,37,2189,5.282420749279539

I purchased it because I love the cinema and this set was or is an important Silent Film. i like to watch a film and be able to talk about a scene as it is shown on the screen. No one gets too upset about talking during a silent film. My son and I talked about the films as they were rolling instead of waiting until the end of the last reel.

3123463,5,B00145CRB0,"As I'm watching this, this very moment.. I'm going to rack this one on my ""one of my Favorites silent movies"" along with Les Vampires. Fantomas is also french made. With English wording. Great acting and really clear as well. One of the best I've seen. Of course their some lines here and their. But be reasonable. For a 100 y/o movie, Its really good. Kino did a good job.
 For me these old silent movies is like my window to the past sort of. From the style of clothing to furniture. But going above that. it's has a great story to follow. I also love the art work on the cover myself..  The details of this is, 5 movie on 3 disc. as has special features, There at least and hour long and one is 90 mins long. For a 1913 movie, That's rare. If you really want to get into old movies. I think you be please with purchase. Also Les Vampires. These 2 a must in a Silent movie collection..",1403568000,4,887,4.121387283236994
3123464,5,B00145CRB0,"*Fantomas* is phenomenal!  I am a big fan of pre-1920's silent films.  These were made in 1913 & while you might expect dramatic overacting (there are very few intertitles) to move the story along, the actors give restrained, nuanced performances.

Fantomas is a bad guy & a half & he makes that abundantly clear in his first scene where it seems that the lady is going to part with her jewelry or else something incredibly awful is going to happen to her.  This is no *good guy kind of bad guy*- he is evil through & through.  The business with Inspector Juve is well written & he's no comic opera policeman either.

You won't go wrong watching these.",1385510400,3,652,4.483050847457627
3123465,5,B00145CRB0,"After one-hundred years, the story of Fantomas is still enthralling. A criminal mastermind is tracked down by a police detective and a reporter, and he manages to outwit them each time. Imagine if Professor Moriarity were tracked down by Inspector Lestrade and Doctor Watson, with no Sherlock Holmes in sight. Though the camera work is primitive, the story flows well and is a fine look back at early crime cinema.",1368316800,3,414,4.928571428571429
3123466,3,B00145CRB0,"For a black and white, silent set of movies, these were fascinating.  Acting was better than I expected (not too many raised black eyebrows and rolling eyes!) and I was kept involved in the story line which continued through the five films.  Fun though.",1360022400,2,253,4.7272727272727275
3123467,5,B00145CRB0,"The first expressions of a new artistic medium are often filled with fantastic energy & liberating possibility. Nowhere is this more evident than in the first years of film, when everything about it was new & its potential was seemingly unlimited. And in the silent crime serials of ""Fantomas"" that potential is explored with astonishing exuberance: the screen overflows with vivid, viscerally powerful images & taps into the primal roots of the psyche. While the craft is there, clearly being developed in shot after shot, it's the sheer wonder of what can be done that captures & enthralls the viewer. In this tale of a master criminal, so clever & invincible that he seems as much above physical laws as he is above human laws, we see the roots of thousands of films to follow ... but how many of them possess such intensity & delight? It's no wonder the Surrealists claimed these films as artistic ancestors after the fact. No time is wasted on anything so mundane as realism -- these stories are as compelling & self-contained as dreams, utterly real while the viewer is inside them. Yet at the same time, as several previous reviewers have noted, being set against a now-vanished world makes them an invaluable time capsule as well. In short, watching isn't a dreary chore in the name of Art -- this is FUN, brimming with adventure & excitement -- highly recommended!",1359072000,4,1373,4.7974683544303796
3123468,5,B00145CRB0,"Being that FANTOMAS(1913) is now 100 years old, all I need to add to the many excellent reviews is that I'm totally blown away that a movie this old can look this good. The restoration is simply amazing. Depth of background and absolute clarity of image, almost as if it all were somehow being faked, color tints to boot!

It's a complicated serialized film with lots of plotting and daring-do, yet VERY realistic when need be, as deaths abound due to Fantomas' evil schemes.

And it all takes place on the streets of a pre-WW1 Paris! When inspector Juve and his assistant are tailing seperate suspects throughout the streets of Paris, it's really not unlike a similar sequence in THE FRENCH CONNECTION, tailing the suspects on the streets of New York City. Downtown masses (people wandering past) and on-site location filming add to a true sense of realism.

Great stuff all around. Worth it many times over just for the visuals. Simply fascinating to watch, all 5+ hours on 3 dvds. Truly a time capsule into another world that was soon to be lost forever...

3357962,5,B00145CRB0,"After one-hundred years, the story of Fantomas is still enthralling. A criminal mastermind is tracked down by a police detective and a reporter, and he manages to outwit them each time. Imagine if Professor Moriarity were tracked down by Inspector Lestrade and Doctor Watson, with no Sherlock Holmes in sight. Though the camera work is primitive, the story flows well and is a fine look back at early crime cinema.",1368316800,3,414,4.928571428571429

3357964,5,B00145CRB0,"The first expressions of a new artistic medium are often filled with fantastic energy & liberating possibility. Nowhere is this more evident than in the first years of film, when everything about it was new & its potential was seemingly unlimited. And in the silent crime serials of ""Fantomas"" that potential is explored with astonishing exuberance: the screen overflows with vivid, viscerally powerful images & taps into the primal roots of the psyche. While the craft is there, clearly being developed in shot after shot, it's the sheer wonder of what can be done that captures & enthralls the viewer. In this tale of a master criminal, so clever & invincible that he seems as much above physical laws as he is above human laws, we see the roots of thousands of films to follow ... but how many of them possess such intensity & delight? It's no wonder the Surrealists claimed these films as artistic ancestors after the fact. No time is wasted on anything so mundane as realism -- these stories are as compelling & self-contained as dreams, utterly real while the viewer is inside them. Yet at the same time, as several previous reviewers have noted, being set against a now-vanished world makes them an invaluable time capsule as well. In short, watching isn't a dreary chore in the name of Art -- this is FUN, brimming with adventure & excitement -- highly recommended!",1359072000,4,1373,4.7974683544303796
3357965,5,B00145CRB0,"Being that FANTOMAS(1913) is now 100 years old, all I need to add to the many excellent reviews is that I'm totally blown away that a movie this old can look this good. The restoration is simply amazing. Depth of background and absolute clarity of image, almost as if it all were somehow being faked, color tints to boot!

It's a complicated serialized film with lots of plotting and daring-do, yet VERY realistic when need be, as deaths abound due to Fantomas' evil schemes.

And it all takes place on the streets of a pre-WW1 Paris! When inspector Juve and his assistant are tailing seperate suspects throughout the streets of Paris, it's really not unlike a similar sequence in THE FRENCH CONNECTION, tailing the suspects on the streets of New York City. Downtown masses (people wandering past) and on-site location filming add to a true sense of realism.

Great stuff all around. Worth it many times over just for the visuals. Simply fascinating to watch, all 5+ hours on 3 dvds. Truly a time capsule into another world that was soon to be lost forever...

The origin of the crime thriller. The inspiration for Dr. Mabuse. ABSOLUTE viewing required. Get it.",1357257600,4,1161,4.7611940298507465

8254530,5,B00145CRB0,"Fantomas was one of the very first super criminals in films. This blu-ray set contains a series of five Fantomas films from 1913-14, about one-hour each. Fantomas can disguise himself as anyone, go anywhere, and do anything; he works both alone and sometimes with a gang. He will stop at nothing, including sending a look-alike actor to the guillotine in his place!
If you are interested in the history of movies, this set is especially interesting because it was made at a time when film makers had just begun telling stories in films (as opposed to simply showing moving pictures of things moving). There is little or no cinematic technique in use. The camera is a passive, stationary observer of actors on a stage - no pans or other camera movement, no closeups except to permit the audience to read letters and telegrams. Incidentally, cinematic techniques begin to appear in the same director's 1915-16 series, ""Les Vampires"".
The films have been fully restored and nighttime scenes are tinted blue.
Highly recommended for cinema buffs.",1504742400,,1041,4.988505747126437

This 2 disc set has five movies that are from 58 to 97 minutes in length. The restoration looks great as the films have been beautifully cleaned. These are black and white films with tinted sequences. The orchestral soundtrack was also remarkable and added a great deal to the movies. There are also two commentaries by film historian David Kalat, a 11 min. documentary about Feuillade, as well as two short films by Feuillade, and an animated gallery of cover art from the Fantomas novellas.",1456963200,5,651,5.027777777777778

8254537,5,B00145CRB0,"A century ago, France's bookstores were selling a series of pulp novellas involving a dangerous criminal and serial killer called Fantomas. Master of disguise and of manipulation, his presence made the fortune of his authors and captivated the public, including the Surrealists like Jean Cocteau and Gabriel Appolinaire. An interest Louis Feuillade also shared as he adapted five episodes of that long saga into a film series that has influenced many, among them Fritz Lang for Dr. Mabuse.

All shot in 1913 and 1914, these episodes are dramatic, exciting and filled with an incredible sense of suspense. One so powerful that each time you wonder if Commissioner Juve and his friend Jerome Fandor will ever capture that fiend. Speaking of Fandor, those that may have read the original novels in French like I did might notice how Jerome's origins are more simple. Not only that, the first episode's ending is less grim and shocking than what the first novel offered. As the latter is easily explainable as being too violent for a wide public release, the absence of Jerome'S origins presents the protagonists as archetypes of good and evil rather than people with different layers as in the novel. Nevertheless, the episodes are very pleasant to watch and Feuillade really knows how to focus your attention on  the action and the plot; making you impatient to watch the next episodes. A forewarner of the television serials that would appear decades later.

Technically, each episode is color-tinted for the moods and time period of the story, uses music cues from the Catalogue Sonimage, and the actors are excellent; in particular Ren Navarre, whose piercing look makes him the perfect person for the Fantomas role. By the way, I adored what Feuillade did at the start of each episode as he displays Navarre's various attires he shall use in his episode. It forewarns the public that the story's dramatic and that the character is dangerous.
But as a pre-warning, I have to mention that the last episode ""The False Magistrate"" is partially complete as several frames of the film are either damaged or lost. Indeed, notes on the screen summarise what happened in those absent sections, including the ending, which sorts of kills the tension of that episode and makes it more difficult to watch. Therefore, that episode's mutilated quality is a clear warning on how we must preserve movies from any deterring conditions whetehr they are human or natural.

Finally, the special features offer very decent bonuses. Two audio commentaries, two other short films Feuillade did, a documentary on the director, and images with posters involving Fantomas, including some with the Jean Marais and Louis de Funes's trilogy.

As a whole, this series is a wonderful treat for those who love suspense and a visual proof of the power Fantomas's character still holds. A character whose novels deserve more translation in English as only the novels offer a complete conclusion to the story. As to who Fantomas really is.",1430697600,,3006,5.028112449799197
