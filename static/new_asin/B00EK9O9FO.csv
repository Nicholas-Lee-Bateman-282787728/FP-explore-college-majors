5925582,4,B00EK9O9FO,"I really enjoyed this movie. The innocent humor for children is what we are missing in this world and William and crew reminded us that it hasn't left, just need to dig a little deeper. Also, this is the first movie I've seen William out of his Hank character from Dr. Quinn. Beyond adorable. :)",1384560000,5,295,4.381818181818182
5925583,5,B00EK9O9FO,"A Country Christmas is like the Christmas movies I remember as a child.  A delightful Christmas feel that almost made me want to put my tree up a month and a half early!  Santa Claus (Abraham Benrubi)  is hearty and robust with his ""Ho-Ho-Ho's"" and touching his finger to the side of his nose.  I'm not ashamed to say I sat there wide-eyed and grinning like a 6 year old and walked around after for a little bit, snapping my fingers and saying, ""Now you see it, now you don't!""

Caitlin Carmichael and Benjamin Stockham are 'wonderful' young actors!  I believe they will be shining stars in the acting world in the years to come.  The childrens father, (William Shockley)  has been one of my favorite actors for a very, very long time  ...  and in this film he is one of the coolest Dad's ever!  And another one of my favorite people (Trace Adkins)  has one scene and it is spot on.  If you're looking for a new Christmas movie that's full of hope, belief and magic, this is the one!  It should be in your DVD library so you can enjoy it year after year.",1384473600,8,1054,4.284263959390863
5925584,5,B00EK9O9FO,"A Country Christmas is THE Christmas movie of the season; one that my family will watch for years to come.  The story line holds you captive throughout the movie, with outstanding performances and great music.  Fun, entertaining, serious by turn, with a sweet ending, the movie has something for everyone.  Country music fans will love this movie.  Executive Producer Kix Brooks and Rascal Flatt's Jay DeMarcus were in charge of the movie's music soundtrack...and it shows. There are special appearances by Trace Adkins and Demarcus.  I definitely recommend this movie for the holidays.",1384473600,,586,5.258064516129032
5925585,5,B00EK9O9FO,"Good, clean family fun, which we need much more of!  If you ever believed in Santa Claus, if your kids don't seem to get as excited about him as you did (or do), add this to your list of fun for the holidays. A ""Scrooge"" decides to take it to the max & force his misguided view that Santa's a myth, on everyone within earshot. Kids rally as Santa looses his magical power. Remember Peter Pan & clapping for Tinker Bell? This is a bit of that, but so much more. Folks of all ages will enjoy this film.",1384473600,7,500,4.05050505050505
5925586,5,B00EK9O9FO,"This is a perfect family movie that was given 5 Dove awards, sure to become a classic for Christmas to come.  It has all the principles you want your children to learn (hope, faith, family values, commitment to doing the right thing, and in the endwell, I cant tell you that!).  This is a sweet and sassy childrens movie, with plenty of undertones for the adults.  A Santa (Abraham Benrubi) that children and adults alike will love, the naughty elf (Mikey Post), two children you wouldnt mind having for your own, the villain who wants to end the Santa Claus myth, and his wicked assistant who may/or may not get her just dessertsall performances you and  the kids will love for years to come.  Timeless in its messagesure to add to the happiness and joy of the Christmas holidays!  Take it home",1384473600,6,795,4.563380281690141
5925587,4,B00EK9O9FO,"I picked up this movie because I enjoy the work of William Shockley, Kix Brooks and Kevin Pollack.

When the movie was finished, I knew that I had to share my thoughts and excitement about the project. This is TRULY a great movie that captures the innocence of childhood, the love of a family, the work ethic and honesty (that can sometimes be lost in this world we live in), and the belief in miracles.

The music is great, the scenarios authentic, and there are lots of laughs. The child actors in this film really take it to the finish and I found myself crying while the girl is crying over her mother's health.

As a teacher, it is difficult to find a film that you can show to children without worrying about what it may contain. This movie is great for all age groups and I will be recommending it to all my friends with kids.",1383955200,19,833,4.292993630573249
5925588,5,B00EK9O9FO,"""A Country Christmas"" is an amazing movie for the entire family to enjoy!  This fun, wholesome film is sure to get you in the holiday mood!  With great seasoned actors like William Shockley, Joey Lauren Adams, Abraham Benrubi, Kevin Pollack and Illeana Douglas as well as up-and-comers such as Caitlin Carmichael and Benjamin Stockham, there's an incredible amount of talent carrying this film.  It was everything I expected and so much more, as the story really pulls at your heartstrings.  Be prepared to laugh, cry, and be filled with the Christmas spirit.",1383264000,14,559,5.043478260869565
5925589,3,B00EK9O9FO,"It was a good and actually for once a unique story line, Here's the but, the Santa Claus' hair, made it hard to take seriously, it was absolutely terrible. Also the little boy's acting was not great, however, the little girl was as great as he was not. I would like to see a remake of this with better costume design and supporting actors. Had a lot of potential.",1484697600,,363,4.27536231884058

It's very much on their level, but older teens and adults will most likely find this to be too juvenile. The story is told from the children's point of view, which doesn't mean that it's bad.

5925727,2,B00EK9O9FO,We look for a new Christmas movie every year that we can watch as a family on Christmas Day. We picked this one for 2013 and were very disappointed in the movie.,1397520000,,161,4.0625
5925728,4,B00EK9O9FO,"Cute story, more for younger children.  Nice to see a family movie
I thought it was well produced, nice Christmas gift.",1392076800,,119,4.666666666666667
5925729,5,B00EK9O9FO,"We bought 5 of these to give out to family and friends. Everyone enjoyed this movie.
I can only hope they make another one for families to enjoy together. The children were awesome in this movie.
I have paid a lot more for movies that I couldn't stand. It is a deal!",1390521600,,266,4.134615384615385
5925730,5,B00EK9O9FO,I loved this film.  Kids are cute and really carry the film. Santa is well play by Benrubi. Good for all ages.,1388620800,,110,4.0
5925731,3,B00EK9O9FO,"It's a low budget movie. You can see that based on the few locations and sets. Also, it's a very childish movie for adults.
There's no deep message on it. It's just for children's entertainment. And there's no much of comedy on it either.
I love Christmas movies but I almost gave up on this one. But it's not that bad. But as I bought it, I wanted to see it.
Surprisingly, the acting is not bad at all. Kevin Pollack is the usual bad guy here. And there's no much of ""country"" on it although it was produced by Kix Brooks of ""Brooks and Dunn"" and Tracey Atkins made a very small appearance on it. It will go directly to my local community library.",1387756800,,648,4.192
5925732,1,B00EK9O9FO,"Santa is portrayed as God in this movie, in the way he is love, heals, etc. My husband and I bought the DVD at WalMart and ended up throwing it away after watching it with our kids, unfortnuatley. It is Dove approved so we thought it would be fine. I was VERY disappointed. Santa Claus heals a mom of cancer in the end. NOT cool.",1386374400,5,329,4.076923076923077
5925733,1,B00EK9O9FO,I did not appreciate the scene where Santa uses his powers to heal the children's mother.  Good luck explaining to your child that Santa can't really do that.  I wish I had previewed this movie before showing it to my children.,1386374400,3,227,4.512195121951219
5925734,5,B00EK9O9FO,"I ordered this movie because I love Christmas and William Shockley! The movie was better than I had imagined. The acting was awesome, especially the children. The story line tugged at my heart as the family dealt with critical illness, and yet most of the movie was light-hearted and fun. The most awesome character was Santa. The actor is 6'7"" tall and has the most amazing voice. He WAS Santa! I highly recommend this precious movie to families everywhere!",1384732800,2,458,4.810126582278481
5925735,5,B00EK9O9FO,"This movie is going to be watched and rewatched by families for years to come. It communicates the spirit of Christmas and love in a way that takes us back to the timeless classics of the holiday season. Santa is wonderful--they could not have cast a more perfect actor for the role, and the child actors do an incredible job in this movie. This is a film that will bring tears and laughter and make your heart swell with joy of the season. William Shockley portrays the father with his usual brilliant interpretation of every role, and I cannot say enough good things about the writing of this story. Make some popcorn and sit down with the whole family to get into the mood for the upcoming holidays!",1384646400,2,702,4.4921875

8606298,2,B00EK9O9FO,"I didn't really care for this movie, I seen the title come through on Amazon Prime and with the title country Christmas, I thought it would be good and funny and have country music in it and be the type of movie to put you in the Christmas spirit. It was depressing and also I did not understand this part. Santa is fading away cuz one man doesn't believe anymore, really? Think of how big the world is and Santa is going to disappear cuz the Arizona senator doesn't believe in him? Then at the end Santa heals the kids mother of cancer, Santa can't do that, so it's just fake. I like Santa movies, usually there innocent and Christmassy. This one was depressing, I don't like depressing movies, esp. not in a Christmas movie. I like a good feel good Christmas movie. The mother looked like a smoker, her face was puffed up like one gets one smokes a lot and her voice was horse like a smokers. The mother coughing was just gross and unnecessary. The script was poorly written, clearly by someone who had little or no knowledge on a good movie. Santa having the power of God, Santa gives kids toys and maybe sometimes a bigger wish to come true but Santa can not heal the sick.",1511827200,,1177,4.330316742081448
