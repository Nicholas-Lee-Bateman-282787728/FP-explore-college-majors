To my amazement, when the order was delivered, it arrived as a DVD set. I also obtained the decimal and Percent video tutor by John Hall from e-bay, and they were delivered as VHS tapes. I tried to get them converted over to DVD's, but was unsuccessful due to the copyright on the VHS.

I tutor kids k-8th grade, and I found John Hall to be an excellent collection to have when trying to explain different sections of math to the children. I can say the John Hall teaches at a pace so that the kids can understand. He also allows time for them to work the problems with him. In addition, the lessons come with a work book so that the kids can try problems to see if they indeed understand the material.

I enjoy video math tutor by John Hall so much that I purchased a  DVD / VHS combo to view the VHS version. I have to say that things are working out very nicely. The summer is approaching, and I plan to work with children and prepare them for Middle School. Encourage them to have a mind set for High School, and plant the good math seeds for my kids in Elementary School.

I am hooked on Amazon, and I have no complaints at this time. I would recommend any of the products that I have purchased from Amazon. Thank you Amazon, and keep up the good work!!",1369958400,,1385,4.176029962546816

I continued on to other Algebra courses in the community college levels, aceing all test just because i enjoyed doing Algebra. When you get confused, you just rewind as many times as needed to watch the instructor do the problems on a black board.",1328572800,,378,4.492753623188406

Mr. Hall's humor and straight-forward explanations helped us both in working through the problem sets.  My son especially appreciated his humor and calm manner.  Thank you Mr. Hall!",1053388800,,331,4.9818181818181815
