Bourbon & Kentucky: A History Distilled",1390867200,,127,5.095238095238095
5047911,5,B001NZ2OPU,"I first watched this documentary on Kentucky Education Television in the summer of 2008.  I later procured my own DVD copy from the Lexington Convention and Visitor's Bureau at a bourbon festival in Nashville TN.  For an ardent bourbon drinker I found the documentary to be educational in not only the history, but the process of how bourbon is distilled.  So if you consider yourself an ardent bourbon drinker as well, buy the DVD, sit back, relax, and sip some corn.",1387497600,4,468,4.753086419753086
5047912,5,B001NZ2OPU,"I caught this documentary on KET and it immediately became my favorite documentary of all time, bar none (sorry, Planet Earth).

In this hour long program viewers learn what makes a bourbon a BOURBON (hint: there are strict regulations on the ingredients) and embark on a tour throughout the great commonwealth of Kentucky. Kent Masterson Brown's soothing southern drawl transports the audience back to the late 1700's when Baptist minister Elijah Craig established what is considered to be the first Bourbon Whiskey distillery operation in Kentucky. You'll learn how Kentucky's geology and non-ferrous water made it the perfect epicenter for the bourbon industry. Brown's documentary takes viewers through the manufacturing process (why are bourbon barrels charred on the inside?), the whiskey trade and the Prohibition era. The program will introduce several famous Kentuckians and several modern distillery operations ending prominently in Woodford Reserve's central Kentucky location amongst the racks of aging barrels and the trademark Triple-Copper Pot Stills.

So, if you consider yourself a Bourbon enthusiast, grab a glass of your favorite ""brown water"", settle in and let Kent Masterson Brown regale you with tales of how this famous spirit came to be quintessentially Kentucky.",1387497600,5,1288,5.6
5047913,1,B001NZ2OPU,"nakedly promotional and amateurish in production. Repeats the same lines over and over and meanders though the story. Cheesy, overall.",1383523200,,134,5.75
5047914,1,B001NZ2OPU,"I stopped watching after about 20 minutes, it was just too boring.  This was very odd because I got it to help me sleep, and it was too boring even for that.",1379030400,,157,3.90625
5047945,2,B001NZ2OPU,Kind of a history of bourbon.  Not very exciting.,1485388800,,49,4.444444444444445
5047946,4,B001NZ2OPU,"Interesting history of the whisky called bourbon which provided a good overview of the development of legal distillation industry in Kentucky. It did not do much to promote the effort that if whisky is not from Kentucky, it is not bourbon. Bourbon can only come from Kentucky. That tag has come to mean any corn mash whisky with some laying it on Tennessee brands and even Canadian brands and is being picked up by new distilleries wherever they are established. It makes as much sense as claiming to make a Canadian whisky in Texas.  The film also was heavily tilted toward JB brands and the brands they own. It would be nice to know of the truly smaller and honestly small batch distilleries that produce very fine and smooth bourbon.  It seemed to skew the definition of what ""small batch"" meant originally.",1485302400,,810,4.697183098591549

Not a lot on how its produced and aged - just enough to get by, but a LOT of interesting history on how bourbon came to be associated with Kentucky.

5047992,3,B001NZ2OPU,"Not a bad review of the early history of bourbon making. Would have enjoyed less detail about the first 20 years and more time spent discussing the past 200 years. 19th, 20th, and 21st century bourbon production almost seemed like an afterthought in the last 10-15 minutes of the video. Still, enjoyed some of the stories about the early days.",1482624000,,343,4.733333333333333

I learned things about Kentucky history I did not know. For others, it might be a bit long on history and short on showing more detail of the process involved in making bourbon at some of these fine distilleries.

5048038,2,B001NZ2OPU,"The information regarding the history of the actual making of Bourbon is interesting. That's worth one of the stars. However regarding the early history and origins, they were colonists and immigrants not ""settlers"". Settlers implies that there was no one else around when they got there. The fact that Kentucky was full of native peoples is barely mentioned. These people taught the europeans about corn; the substance from which bourbon is made. Yet, the history which includes the local native people is not told. Nor is there any mention of the fact that slaves were doing a lot of the work. It's historically inaccurate. And, is told from a very euro-centric, white-only point of view. Thus, 2 stars.",1481241600,,705,4.983050847457627

5048095,5,B001NZ2OPU,"This is very informative and answers all the ""Whys?"" I had about Kentucky bourbon. One learns why it's called Kentucky Bourbon, and why Kentucky became popular for distilling (it's in the plentiful water!).  The climate is ideal for growing corn, a crop that has many uses.

The documentary starts out focusing on Kentucky, but soon spreads out to the history of distilling and the importance of whiskey and bourbon. The Whisky Rebellion of 1791 that began in Pennsylvania affected the distillers in Kentucky, as it resulted in a higher tax on the distillers everywhere.  So why is the liquid also called Bourbon?  Because of the friendship between the US and France at the time.  That explains many of the French-sounding names like Louisville, Versailles, etc!  Excess corn and whiskey was then shipped down river via the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, a town that became popular with selling the drink internationally.

The narrator, Kent Masterson Brown, dresses like a college professor, walks around historical sites in Kentucky, describes documents and paintings. He tells stories of the earlier distillers, among whom are Baptist ministers, governors and a woman.  Only one sentence covers the Prohibition period (it brought distilling nearly to a standstill), but the documentary ends showing some of the locally-distilled Bourbon with historical names like Elijah Craig, Old Crow, Evan Williams.  The viewer learns the whys and hows of the drink's history, how it's distilled and the importance to the history of Kentucky.",1480377600,2,1545,5.273469387755102

This fun video will give you the lowdown on everything corn likker - from it's origins in the need to use up surplus corn, to the origin of the Whiskey Rebellion, and the role of Bourbon in the growth of Mississippi River commerce and flatboat traffic.  Exhaustively researched and genially presented by an expert, this film's main aim is to increase tourist traffic to Kentucky.

5048345,2,B001NZ2OPU,"With such an interesting subject, I'm actually impressed that they managed to make such a boring film about it.
Dry narration, obviously sponsored scripting, etc.  It feels like the kind of thing that would play in the background while you are waiting in line for a distillery tour.  Even the historical sections are dull.",1443484800,,322,4.944444444444445

5048353,4,B001NZ2OPU,"It's not sexy, it's not flashy, the host dresses like a middle school civics teacher from the 1990's, and it wasn't produced to grab for ratings on a basic cable network. This documentary does what it sought out to do.

If you're genuinely interested in the history of Kentucky Bourbon, you'll enjoy this. It's got a wealth of information about its origins and its role in American, and particularly Kentuckian, history. If, however, you're expecting a History Channel-esque documentary full of reenactments and dramatizations you'll be sorely disappointed.

This is about the history of bourbon and it was not titled nor advertised as a presentation about modern distileries. You get what you were offered from this film and they did a fine job.",1437955200,7,746,5.056910569105691

8508437,5,B001NZ2OPU,Why don't  we see more Bourbon and Rye DVD's?? This one is great. I wish there were new updated and informative dvds about the Bourbon Boom in America today. I would buy them in a heartbeat. Would be great to have on in the background while our bourbon group does tastings and meet and greets. Keep up the good work.,1514592000,,316,4.266666666666667

8508441,5,B001NZ2OPU,"Wow!  There is a wealth of information in this video.  The quality of the video filming is about that of what you would see in local Chamber of Commerce informational video on a tour, but the information just abounds in it.  I've watched other documentaries on the history of spirits, and sometimes I question what I really learned when I got to the end.  This documentary is the exact opposite.  The host seems to be bursting with knowledge of the bourbon making history and can't seem to rattle it off fast enough.  It is like the information for what would fill an entire book has been distilled down to fit in a quick video.  This is also a bit of a drawback as it does seem like I was whisked though this entire history without time to digest some of it - as one fact seems to come right after the next - but I was very impressed by the amount of information packed into this little video.",1496707200,,894,4.285714285714286
