7872066,5,6304474423,"Like many of the older National Geographic videos this film is a treasure. I would highly recommend this tape because of the great amount of information that is contained within it about the titular animal, but also because the film is so charming and relaxing to watch. I should note that the information in this film is dated - then again it is an older film. I bought it simply for the joy of watching it.",1239667200,,408,4.381578947368421
