765358,3,6304052855,"Although purists often sneer at Sylvester McCoy, for depicting the Doctor as a slightly farcical character, I enjoy watching his series for precisley the same reason.  Surely, one of the attractions of Dr Who is that it is (dare I say it) a little bit naff and therefore amusing in a low budget B movie kind of way.  I found Ghostlight to be very atmospheric with it's use of moody lighting and smokey basements. The whole Victorian setting gave the story a distinctly ""Hammer House of Horror"" feel.  Ace, in my opinion, was the best assistant that Sylvester McCoy ever had and she did help to lend a plausible sense of anxiety and foreboding to the script.  My only critisizim is that the plot does seem to become a bit confusing towards the third episode.  Light - who bares an uncanny resemblance to Lionel Blare - never convinced me of his need to destroy the earth. He was willing to destroy all life merely because his classification exercise was ruined by change?  Surely no enemy of the Doctor can be that analy retentive?  But overall it's a good bit of spooky fun.",1005350400,5,1074,4.5625
765359,1,6304052855,"...so they couldn't tarnish the show's name anymore.
For me the episode is divided into two plot lines:
(1)-Ace and the Doctor: It's succeeds rarely, but none the less for this era, 5 minutes being worthwhile is saying something.
(2)-The house and it's mystery:
Unbelievably poor writing, simplistic but sloppy, plot structure.
The characters are an absolute waste of time, although they did succeed in almost convincing me that I was so wrong for ever watching Dr. Who. The Tom Baker episode ""the Stones of Blood"" is similar in most all counts and superior in all.
This goes down with: ""The Twin Dilemma"" and ""Paradise Towers"" as the ones to avoid.",1002067200,5,649,4.8558558558558556
765360,5,6304052855,"What can I say, probably one of the best episodes of Doctor Who. It had great surprises like, Light, and the aliens at the bottom of the house. Also change is something that will play a part in this adventure. Then there is a freaky lady and a story with the family. Also the Doctor takes Ace back to the house so she can confront her biggest fear. Overall Ghost Light could be the best Doctor Who ever.",993945600,6,403,4.17948717948718
765361,5,6304052855,"This adventure reminds me of a good painting - no matter how many times you see it you always find something new.
Possibly the most densely-plotted Dr Who story ever written, virtually every word has some  deeper meaning or significiance.  The Doctor/Ace double-act was one of the  strongest Doctor/companion teams ever in the series - what other Doctor  would take his companion back in time to make her face her worst nightmare?  In this case it's a Victorian mansion which will one day become the  haunted house Ace entered as a teenager.  The sets are lavish and look like  they were made for a high-budget period drama, the music is superbly  brooding and the dialogue is powerful.  With its themes on evolution, its  gritty realism and its well-written characters, this is up there with the  best of the '70s Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee stories.",953164800,25,849,4.779310344827586
765362,5,6304052855,"This is the first time a WHO story frightened me since the early Tom Baker years. Wow. Thankfully, the show's excesses are reined in, providing for a tight (rare for McCoy-era), satisfying WHO experience. The interactions  between the Doctor and Ace are WONDERFUL, quite mature for WHO. Also, the  sets are quite nice, the music is perfect, the monsters are cool, and the  story is intriguing. The violence, or suggestion thereof, works in the  story and seems not at all out of place... Recommended...",931996800,8,502,4.940476190476191

765463,5,6304052855,"There are enough reviews that discuss the plot in detail so I'll tell you about my husband's story and why Dr. Who is important to him. He's from England and was a schoolboy when the first show started. He and his friends waited breathlessly for this new sci-fi ""programme""but the premier was postponed because it was scheduled for Saturday, November 4, 1963. President Kennedy had been assassinated the day before so all programming in the UK was averted to mourning the loss of this great leader of their closest ally nation.

So the BBC had to reschedule the first show and, just through word of mouth, anticipation mounted. The show was an instant hit and even with all the regenerations, cheesy settings, goofy plots and, yes, the daleks (with their toilet plunger!), it endured. My husband and all his mates were hooked and never missed a show. Our son is 20 and pretty much since any DVD's came out, hubby started to inculcate him into Dr. Who mania. They've watched every season, every Doctor and companion and every villain. While I hate the scarf-laden 4th Doctor, I got hooked with Christopher Eccleston when we saw him on a visit to England. Then David Tennant was our favorite. Then we went back and forth between Matt Smith or Tennant and we've had quite the lively discussions about it. Which companion is in the show makes a huge difference. As far as bad guys, my favorites are the Weeping Angels, son loves the Cybermen and The Silence, and DH loves the dopey (I can't stand that voice!) Daleks, probably for sentimental reasons.

As for the reviewed Classic Season 26, my guys say they love it. Even though this may not be their fave Doctor, they love anything associated with the show and can't bring themselves to say anything negative...only varying in the positives.

So not so much me, but my experts in the family highly recommend this video.",1409616000,2,1867,4.720858895705521

765572,1,6304052855,"If an episode of Doctor Who had been written, directed, and cast by David Lynch, it might look a lot like Ghost Light. But only if David Lynch had never seen an episode of Doctor Who before in his entire life and was only given the names of the Doctor and Ace to work with and no character background. The main characters, the Doctor and Ace, just sort of stumble around an old house. The Doctor never does anything unique to his established personality and traits. It's all atomsphere and strange characters with events happening for no apparent reason. No wonder the show was cancelled during Sylvester McCoy's era.",1365984000,3,617,4.669724770642202

I ordered this because it was the only cheap one that came from the good era of Sylvester McCoy, but even I, huge fan of his that I am, was unprepared for how good the story was.  One of the things I like most about seasons 25 & 26 is that you really get a feel for all the characters that are only in one serial, & this was no exception.  And it was a complex story; the Doctor said as much himself with the quote at the top.  I was surprised to find that this was McCoy's favorite serial he starred in.

765576,4,6304052855,"ALL Dr. Who's are good, great imagination vitamins for the mind, but the very first shows were kind of simple, being a kind of Sesame St. in intent ""Oh look kids, here are the pyramids!"", but even so, the imaginative fundamental idea of the Tardis had great potential, and it turned out that fathers and big brothers and older girls enjoyed it even more. The Who writers gradually made the stories more grown up and exciting. And incidentally higher budget which made productions classier. Here we have one of the early results of that process, with fine acting: many of the Dr. Who actors and actresses in the early and middle years were highly trained Shakespearean quality performers. So enjoy and open the mind, forgive the not quite there effects (by today's standards - but advanced for the time) and enjoy the great stories.",1362009600,,831,4.777777777777778

765628,2,6304052855,I'm pretty unhappy with this release. The music track has been remastered and is far too loud. In the original TV version it was rather subtle.

765629,4,6304052855,"In the Sylvester McCoy era Doctor Who epsidoe entitled ""Ghost Light"" the Doctor and Ace have travled to 1883 to a house that Ace came upon in 1983 in her home town of Periveal.  As a child she felt an evil that caused her to set fire to the old house and the Doctor decides to go and visit the house when it still had residents which just happen to be about a hundred years ago.
  The house while during the day is rather quiet it is the night in which the residents come to life. Josiah Samuel Smith owner of the home is about to entertain Reverend Matthews who is against Smith's views on evolotuion. Meanwhile Mrs. Prtichet the night house maid along with the other night servents are trying to keep famous hunter Redvers Fenn-Cooper and guest of Smith from roaming about and losing his mind.
  The Doctor and Ace encounter Nimrod a neaderthal butler who seems to be in Smith's employ and Smith's ward a young lady Gwendoline who rather likes Ace's modern thinking. The Doctor is trying to make sense of the strange things going on around him and why it is forbidden for anyone to enter the cellar of the home save for Smith or Nimrod. The Doctor is trying  to figure out what Smith's agenda is and the only one making any sense is Fenn-Cooper and all he seems to care about is hunting the biggest game of his life and all he seems to be looking at is a picture of Queen Victoria.
  Meanwhile in the very cellar of the house a being who refers to itself as ""Control"" has become loose within the home and clearly it want's something or someone and Ace seems to be the only one to get near it to make any sense of what it wants. What the Doctor and Ace discover is an anceotn spaceship that came to Earth at a point when Nimrod and his people still roamed it. And Control wasn't the only thing trapped within the ship but something else something that even Smith still fears to this day.
  Can the Doctor and Ace figure out what is truly happening in this house? Will Smith plans come to happen? Will Fenn-Cooper score the biggest game of all? Will Control finally be able to get what it wants? All this plus police officers in cabinets drawers, holy men turned into apes and a soup course you will never forget.  So check out ""Ghost Light"" to find out.",1323993600,,2254,4.304964539007092
765630,5,6304052855,"Much like the Curse of Fenric, this story is maligned on Amazon, yet it is such a well-done episode in many aspects, these negative reviews are rather revolting and surprising. Ghost Light is one of McCoy's best adventures from his strong final season alongside The Curse of Fenric, Survival, and Battlefield. It is a wonder Who stopped here- it was getting good!

The story is very complicated but is brilliant once you get it and it will take some time to get! Luckily, the DVD is perfect for viewing the story over and over again, and the commentary really helps along with the making of feature and the deleted scenes. The story revolves around the weird happenings at a Victorian Manse in Perivale called Gabriel Chase where evolution seems to be going faster and faster and something clearly wants that to stop. With a mirage of weird and wild characters, great sets and costumes (typical BBC), and an eerie score by Mark Ayres evoking Dracula-esque feelings, Ghost Light may be baffling but it is visually beautiful and viscerally appealing, not to mention so rewarding for those who finally figure out this interesting and fantastic story.

McCoy is once again great as this new, darker Doctor, and Aldred continues to impress as Ace, who is really put up center stage this episode and we learn a load about her past. Ian Hogg is great as Josiah, and the other guest actors, for the most part, do fantastic. The actor who plays Light is hammy and the story is a bit too rushed with no throwaway lines making it hard to keep up. Overall though, my complaints are few. The story is actually creepy and very dark.

It's odd Doctor Who left after Season 26 when the ante was yanked up with good production, good stories, and a new darker, more adult tone. Ghost Light is a great example of a shining late of late Who. The DVD is packed with fun features and is a must buy for fans and for those naysayers who claimed to be confused. Watch it again!",1307404800,6,1952,4.571428571428571
765631,5,6304052855,doctor who:ghost light is one of the most detailed stories of any doctor who period. it has a haunted and creepy old house storie feeling to the alien threat which makes the story a magical and special take on the doctor who stories as they come to be known. the doctor and ace make one hell of a double team of talent and acting. Sylvester McCoy is at his top level of acting as the doctor in this story. Sophie Aldred as ace does a remarkable job in this remarkable gem of a tale. the set design is top class all around. i love the mood and seting of this storie. it stands out as one of the best doctor who tales ever to grace the screen. it stands out as a classical doctor who tale in every sense.,1271376000,3,702,4.057553956834532
765632,5,6304052855,"GHOST LIGHT is amazing. Watch it once and you'll be befuddled. Watch it twice and you'll be astounded. At the very least it's one of the more complex stories they ever did, simply because they don't stop very often to explain what's going on. Ace was always a bit smarter than the average companion, and here she proves that she can work the plot out on her own without needing to constantly ask the Doctor what's up. Why do all the older companions need to be certifiable idiots? One effect of making Ace brighter is that they needed to make the Doctor smarter to show her up, and Sylvester McCoy is definitely up to the task. He's quiet and cunning and utterly cool.

We get an excellent guest cast. Most memorable for me is Michael Cochrane as Redvers Fenn-Cooper (James Fennimore-Cooper?), a great white hunter gone insane and skulking about a Victorian mansion. The mansion is eerie, populated by weird creatures and weirder humans, and some who aren't quite human. The music is a huge step up from the early-Eighties muzak, and contributes to the gloomy, spooky atmosphere.

Three aliens are living on Earth, in Perivale of all places. One plots to assassinate Queen Victoria while he keeps the other two locked away. One of them, ""Control"", breaks free and wants to become more human. The third, ""Light"", gets loose and threatens to freeze all life on the Earth to stop it evolving -- it turns out that these three were a survey team, but their insane, obsessive leader could not deal with all lifeforms on Earth constantly changing and evolving, so they ended up staying much longer than they'd planned. They have a Neandertal butler as well.

The story makes good use of the theory of evolution as well as Victorian anti-evolutionists. The result is a creepy and suspenseful little chamber-drama, the like of which DOCTOR WHO had never quite managed before -- although some episodes of the new series have come close.",1259798400,5,1926,4.7604790419161676
765633,5,6304052855,"Ghost Light is a brilliantly complex and unusual story that benefits greatly from repeated viewings. If you prefer to have a story spoon-fed to you, then it's probably not going to be your cup of tea. On the other hand, if you like a story that makes you think then Ghost Light is for you.

Ghost Light begins the so-called ""Ace Trilogy"" that consisted of the final three stories of the original program. For the first time in Doctor Who the companion really becomes central to the storyline, mirroring the way the show would be approached when the new series began in 2005. Sylvester McCoy gives his best performance as the seventh incarnation of the Doctor and Sophie Aldred steps up her game, too, as another layer is added to Ace. The supporting cast is absolutely top notch, as well.

In an era known for its often poor production Ghost Light looks pristine. The atmosphere is suitably dark and gloomy, though the title can be misleading if you take it at face value. Nothing in this story should be taken at face value, however, as layer after layer of mystery slowly unfolds. Don't be surprised if you're a little puzzled on your first viewing, particularly if you don't give it your full attention. In the end, it all pays off in a tale that's become my favorite Doctor Who entry of the '80s.",1258416000,3,1300,4.575107296137339
765634,3,6304052855,"Even though (as many have pointed out already) the story made almost no sense, it was actually quite enjoyable - even a little suspenseful.  What was most disappointing, though, was the big build-up to some unfathomable villain who simply never materialized.  The character Light was interesting, but hardly a villain. True, he wanted to extinguish all life (and if he really was ""Light"", presumably he could do that) - but it was only because he'd grown weary of having to constantly re-catalogue everything rather than from any malevolent intent.  The character Control was even a bigger disappointment in that she seemed to be, if not a villain at least an entity that would have to be seriously dealt with before the day could be saved.  But no, a fancy pinafore was all it took to subdue her.  Bottom line: having concepts as characters never quite works out.  Most of all, though, where in the world did the lord of the manor's resolve to assassinate Queen Victoria come from?  And why did all that resolve dissipate the moment his invitation to the Queen's Ball was destroyed?  On the plus side, Sylvester McCoy's particular Dr Who persona was very well suited to this story - in contrast to the much better story, Survival, wherein he was totally ill suited.",1241740800,3,1266,4.8018433179723505
765635,5,6304052855,"I've never bought into the notion that this story is especially difficult to understand, and it amuses me that this view persists. Putting aside the fact that if you're obsessing over the plot-logic in a Doctor Who story, you're probably watching the wrong show, I figured the plot out on my first viewing of the story on VHS, having read/heard relatively little about the serial except that it was allegedly hard to comprehend but that the production values and acting were generally good.

Obviously, the latter point is very much accurate, with a quality of acting and production values at very much the same level as the ""serious dramas"" the BBC was selling to Masterpiece Theatre at the time. The former assertion, though, is just nonsense as the story is in fact rather straightforward. Indeed, it feels every bit like a classic Doctor Who set-up, except perhaps that McCoy's more proactive Doctor is clearly driving events more so than in other eras of the show. In short, the remnants of an alien survey expedition share a mysterious house in Perivale with an even more dangerous force, and the Doctor wants to find out what they're all up to before too many people get hurt. I didn't need DVD extras or even the Target novelization to work this out.

Regarding the script, which many critics seem to single out for derision, I find it to be among the best of the ""original"" series' entire run up there with Douglas Adams and company's hallowed ""City of Death,"" David Whitaker's ""The Crusade"" and Robert Holmes' ""The Caves of Androzani."" In particular, I find that it strikes a wonderful balance between verbal (and visual) wit and an edge of darkness to make it clear that the stakes are high. Script aside, what I find most amusing about the story is that at its heart what people seem to be criticizing it for is that it's a case where the production team assumed Doctor Who's viewers were smart enough to get it without having every element underlined and emphasized on-screen. It would seem that this is perhaps the one thing about this story that they got wrong.",1229385600,6,2076,4.732044198895028
765636,3,6304052855,"I am an unabashed Who lover and as big a McCoy hater.  I just never appreciated him in the role, as his portrayal of the Doctor seemed to be talking down to the viwer and his quirky pronunciation and innunciation drove me nuts.  THIS episode however is one of his better ones, and is highly watchable.  He seems much more restrained.  This may likely be due to the director of the episode who it seems kept him on a tighter leash.  It is actually a pretty fun episode, though I can't help but wonder how much better this one would have been with another of the Doctors",1220400000,,568,4.271028037383178
765637,1,6304052855,"I like convoluted plots. ""Convoluted,"" not disjointed, impenetrable, and impossible to rationalize, all of which describe ""Ghost Light.""

Cheesy monsters with grand plans to destroy/take over the Earth are a staple of Doctor Who, but the motive for this story's monster makes absolutely no sense when considered in combination with its intelligence and level of scientific advancement. Why do the antagonists fight each other in one scene and then have a formal dinner party in the next? Why does no one wonder what the Doctor and Ace are doing running around a private home? What was with the snuffbox? The whole thing's a mess. I kept rewinding and watching scenes again and again, figuring I must have missed something.

Other reviews have said that the DVD extras make things more clear. That's sad. Who would want to subject themselves to more of this nonsensical story? I didn't. If you need a commentary to explain what's happening and why, your script is a failure.

The lines whispered by Control through the door are impossible to hear. If you're going to have an actress hiss and slur her lines, don't have her also use made-up words. ""Free-ness?"" That would have been fine if you could have heard what she was saying underneath all the clanging music, otherwise, use ""freedom,"" and give the viewer a chance. I'm not used to needing subtitles in an English television show. (Glaswegian accents excepted.)

As always in the McCoy era, the theme and opening titles are a joke. The music has been sapped of its urgency, and somehow the enormous technological advances since 1963 resulted in amateurish-looking graphics in 1989.

I've been steadily working my way through the canon, purchasing as many DVDs as I can afford with the aim of owning every Doctor Who story someday. It may end up being every story but one.",1219017600,7,1825,4.893203883495145
765687,1,6304052855,"If there were any lingering doubts about how bad this serial was when I watched it on TV, they were smashed away when I bought the DVD. Not from the serial itself. My opinion was about the same. But the extras just made me sick.

Honestly, after watching the writer, script editor, and the like pat themselves on the back for making a ""Complicated"" story, I wanted to throw the television set out the window. Plan to assassinate Queen Victoria? Josiah would be arrested in about five seconds? What would make him think they would make him King? Light making a survey but trying to stop the human race from evolving... uh, could you run that by me again? If the audience is lost, then you haven't made a good script, you've friggen lost them.

Andrew Cartmel (script editor) talking about how it seems straightforward to him, after about a thousand reads and edits, and how he doesn't understand why more people can't follow it. Maybe because IT WAS ONLY MEANT TO BE SHOWN ON TV ONCE. And people in the 80's would've only watched it once, maybe twice with a repeat.

I could go on, but frankly, I've had enough. This was NOT a return to Doctor Who's best, as some people have claimed. (You could make a better case for The Curse of Fenric or Survival, but that's another review). Just avoid it like leprosy.",1198713600,13,1306,4.5021097046413505
765688,1,6304052855,"Admittedly, I have not bought, or will not buy, Ghost Light on DVD.  I did own the VHS at one point, but have since donated it on to a friend, just to get it out of my collection. You see, it was taking up far too much valuable space which could be used for other more worthy Doctor Who titles, preferably from the first six Doctors.  In a sense, this colossal waste of space could be considered addition by subtraction.  Fortunately, the aforementioned friend still considers me a friend.  He didn't even charge me to take it off my hands.  Ghost Light ranks right up there with The Happiness Patrol (notice how I refrained from calling it Crappiness Patrol) as the absolute  worst Doctor Who ever.  That is, until series three of the new series, but that's for another review.  We'll simply refer to this as the armpit of the classic series.  Light needing to wipe out the human race because its evolution was making his encyclopedia outdated. What trash!  If that isn't the dumbest storyline ...  Why not do a story about a villain killing people who refuse to be happy ... Oh wait ... That's already been tried ...  Who wrote during the McCoy era?  And little annoying Ace, the worst companion ever, sulks when not blowing things up.  She's so miserable that you gotta wonder how she managed to escape being offed in The Happiness Patrol.  I never thought another companion could make me long for Melanie Bush.

I'm ready for the negative votes from McCoy apologists, so bring them on. This story reinforces the fact that the McCoy era destroyed classic Doctor Who.",1189382400,6,1569,4.610108303249097
765689,3,6304052855,"One of the fun things about ""Doctor Who"" is you never know where or when you'll end up next. Right from the start, the show's basic premise delightfully freed writers from the constraining laws of time and space, and that's as true of ""Ghost Light"" as it was before and (thankfully now) since. The laws of basic storytelling are another matter entirely, however. Adaptable as they are in style and fashion, they remain ironclad and immutable in substance no matter whether it's 1969 or 1989, regardless of whether the Doctor finds himself gallivanting about right here on Earth or on a distant planet, in the forgotten past or the unforeseen future--or, as the case may be, rural England in 1883. The writer and (more importantly) the script editor of ""Ghost Light"" blithely ignore all this, I'm afraid, whether from sheer laziness or a misplaced sense of what constitutes cutting-edge creativity I'm not quite certain, though I suspect the latter. In any case, the storyline (if I may call it that) suffers as a result, and what might potentially have been a great Doctor Who adventure winds up instead an unsatisfying muddled mess, a rough draft masquerading as a finished product.

What makes this story so confusing? Lots of things, probably, but the key fault seems to be that the many different characters and their interrelationships are never clarified properly and so the overall significance of their words and actions remains almost utterly opaque to the viewer even as the final credits start rolling. Some mystery is good at the beginning, even preferable of course, but gradually the Doctor should unravel that mystery for himself (which he does, apparently) AND for the viewer, if by no other means then by the tried-and-true method of having him explain matters to the viewer's proxy, the Doctor's human traveling companion. Yes, borderline sexist or not, ""Ghost Light"" cries out like a banshee for one of those paternalistic moments when the companion looks confused and the Doctor kindly starts in ""well, you see, Jo..."" (or Ace, as the case may be)--these can be done quite well, too, actually, as we've already seen in another storyline from the McCoy era, ""Remembrance of the Daleks"", and that was for classic arch-enemies whom only the newest viewer would be unfamiliar with while all of the characters in our storyline here (quite a few at that, oh dear) are prior unknowns requiring some level of exposition at least. An attentive script editor would've made sure such exposition was forthcoming as well as probably advising against a dull defused climax in which the Doctor stops the obsessive-compulsive Light from wiping out all life on earth by basically just talking him out of it. Our hypothetical attentive script editor might also have taken our fledgling writer aside and kindly clued him in that assassinating Queen Victoria (as per Josiah's evil scheme) would not have ipso facto overthrown the British government: the royals have this whole bloodline succession thing so that when one dies another promptly fills the role, y'know, and anyway there's still the Prime Minister and Parliament and all.

So is ""Ghost Light"" a total flop? Not entirely. Perhaps its most redeeming feature is the set design and costuming. Leave it to the BBC to get this down to a tee, but everything is wonderfully authentic and historically accurate so that you do really feel like all this sound and fury signifying whatever is sure enough transpiring in the Victorian era. The controversy surrounding Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection are part and parcel of this Victorian ambiance and yet are thoroughly integrated into the excuse for a plot in sophisticated and clever ways, most especially linking up with the inorganically alien Light's job stress and accompanying motivation to bring some stability and order to Earth's ever burgeoning profusion of lifeforms by wiping them all out (this by the way is probably one of the most uniquely weirdest and morbidly comical motivations for a ""villain"" in television history). Sylvester McCoy takes a befuddled script and makes the most of it, doing a fine job as the Doctor and still showing an immense talent for convincingly shifting from goofy to serious in a double-heartbeat in ways that almost send a chill down your spine. A perfect showcase for this occurs when Ace realizes the Doctor has kindly surprised her by taking her back to the past of a house that was her worst nightmare (kind of unsettling behavior on his part), and she asks him bitterly if there aren't things he hates: watch as he replies first with such silly offhand things as burnt toast and bus stations and then adds unrequited love, tyranny, and cruelty to the list with such utter conviction that it's like he's feeling these awful things deep down in his bones even as he utters them. A dramatically brilliant moment almost buried in the very undramatic and unbrilliant clutter around it.

Finally, ""Ghost Light"" is somewhat important in terms of the show's historical development as a whole, focusing much as it does on the character and the past of the Doctor's human traveling companion, Ace. This was quite rather unusual and unprecedented at the time and was remarked as such, whereas with ""Doctor Who"" today it's a definite and prominent aspect of the show's format, especially with Rose and her circle of family and friends. In hindsight we can see this storyline as a transitional one in that regard. That said, any attempt to therefore use it to get young fans of only the new series interested in classic Who would be sorely misguided and would doubtlessly backfire. No, this one's mainly for ""Doctor Who"" DVD collectors every bit as obsessively completist as the Light and of course for diehard fans (such as myself, admittedly) who love this show even when it totally drops the ball.",1189296000,8,5859,4.970438328236494
765690,4,6304052855,"It seems odd to me that I never saw this story during the PBS run so it is a real treat to buy and watch a Doctor Who DVD from the later years that I haven't seen.

The biggest critique for me is the music overwhelms the dialog at several points, same as in Fenric.  But getting past that the story does suffer from not enough exposition of the bad guys.  Often times, one deosn't require much exposition but just enough to know what they are.

I had no real idea of who or what Josiah was, I kind of got he was evolving from the reference to his husks.  And Control, I thought Control was the ship's computer.  Still, even with the confusion over the narrative, all the performances are fun to watch.  Esp. Michael Cochrane as a confused explorer sort (no wonder he's confused, considering the story he's been written into).

I think the big thing that makes the story suffer is in 1989 they didn't have the special effects to make the Angel of Light creepy enough.  What's here is fairly creepy but never quite reaches chilling except for in the deleted scenes.

I never really enjoyed Sophie Aldred as the street smart companion, as people who are street smart tend to annoy me, but in this story she is much better and she doesn't wear that horrid bomber jacket, I believe it has one scene and it is draped over a chair.

Sylvester McCoy, I always enjoy his performance. I think he's probably the best Doctor since Tom Baker.  But again, in spite of his performance, there seems to be something missing of his character from this story.

I still think it is worth it for the Doctor Who fan (especially one who missed the original airing) but the casual fan  may be left with cold feeling and probably rightly so.",1180310400,7,1716,4.406349206349207
765691,3,6304052855,"I was a long-time fan of Dr. Who before dropping out in my late teens, so I never saw the last season stories. The new series revived my interest however and I've found myself dipping back into the well, so-to-speak. This was the first Sylvester McCoy story I had ever seen but I was intrigued after reading the conflicting reviews. First off, the production quality might be even worse than '70s-era Pertwee and Tom Baker episodes. Despite any restoration that might have taken place, the videotape appears to be melting away in front of your eyes as you watch. My first impression of McCoy -- not bad, although his companion, the lantern-jawed Ace is less than, IMHO. As for the story...hmmm, I'm still mulling it over. Despite the many explanations from apologists about the mysterious and experimental nature of the tale...let's just say I believe the whole thing, at three episodes, is rushed and...missing something. Still, it's not without it's charms, I suppose. The DVD features an interesting documentary that doesn't really shine much ""light"" on the subject -- at least I didn't think so. Didn't listen to the commentary track though. Make no mistake, if you are in anyway tempted to show this to newbies or fans of the new show, fergitaboutit.

The only thing that could knock this story up to a five, would have been if Slyvester McCoy had done the commentary. At least Sophie Aldred was included. Nice.",1171929600,3,456,4.376470588235295

765694,2,6304052855,It is easy to see why this was the final season for the longest running Drama in telivision history.  Ghost Light has a weak story and is perhaps my least favorite Dr Who episode ever.  It does however build a little on Ace's backstory but not enough to redeem a slow moving and at times pointless story.  I would recomend this episode to only the most dedicated fans that want to build their library.,1153267200,5,401,4.391891891891892
765695,1,6304052855,"One star may seem harsh for this British icon, but I'd give it zero if at all possible. I'm actually a very big Doctor Who fan and I had never seen Ghostlight. When I finally had a chance to see this I was truly disappointed. This long running serial had so many excellent stories that this is about the poorest example of it. For anyone thinking of watching Doctor Who for the first time give this story a go by.

 While watching this it appears that after Tom Baker the serial began to take a wrong turn somewhere. For those who have never seen the Doctor, start with any Tom Baker stories instead and there are plenty of DVDs available with him in it. The blame can be placed on many people for the wrong turn, sometimes I think it is producer John Nathan Turner who was on the job for far too long, but it goes deeper than that.

  It would be fair to explain the plot of Ghostlight, but I'm actually doing the reader a favor not doing so. It really is a convoluted drama that starts and goes nowhere. For those who don't know, the Doctor is an alien who travels through time and space in a old British police box. I will tell you this though... that this story is like many many of the other Doctor Who stories involving aliens and a space ship. Past that there really is nothing else worth revealing about it.

  What is the saddest about Ghostlight is reflected by Sylvester McCoy's tenure as the Doctor and that is potential. If someone said that there wasn't a good Sylvester McCoy story, they would be right, but like with Ghostlight it wasn't his fault. The scripts he had to work from, the production, and the direction are just horrible. There seemed to be some lingering effects from the firing of the previous Doctor Colin Baker which hampered the quality and creative process in the series. Colin Baker also suffered from poor scripts, and the like, but with some of those stories his true potential did come across. For poor Sylvester McCoy, it never even had a chance to emerge.

  There was a great lack of justice in the dismisal of Colin Baker who was the fall guy for what was wrong with Doctor Who and when the show got axed it was a vindication. Like it or not, if Ghostlight was an example of what the next season of the serial could be it was a mercy killing. Like all good things the Doctor has recently returned and puts Ghostlight in its proper place... the trash can.",1151539200,10,2397,4.3640449438202245
765696,5,6304052855,"Let me confess upfront that Sylvester McCoy is not my favorite Doctor (or anyone else's, apparently, outside of a small circle of friends and family).  I'm a hopeless Patrick Troughton (Second Doctor) fan, having obsessively hunted down and watched (or in most cases, listened to - thanks to the BBC's unforgiveable ""tidying up"" policies of the early 70s) every scrap of his superb work as the Doctor, I'm embarrassed to admit to myself.  Tom Baker was the Doctor I knew first and best, and he runs a close second to Troughton.  As for the others, well, this is the first Sylvester McCoy storyline I've seen.  I would rank the Doctors in this rough order, from best to least best:

Patrick Troughton

Tom Baker

John Pertwee

Peter Davison

William Hartnell (for the original, cranky old coot take on the Doctor, rather than for any particularly impressive acting)

Sylvester McCoy

Colin Baker -

 though it's probably a close tossup at the top and bottom tiers.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we have them all.  The best storylines I've seen (or heard, in Troughton's case) so far are:

Fury from the Deep  (no episodes surviving on film/video),

Faceless Ones  (two episodes surviving on film/video),

City of Death, and

Talons of Wang-Chiang.

Ghost Light, featuring my second-least-favorite Doctor, might just make this list.  The problem is that my copy of the @#%&ing DVD started skipping (on all three of my DVD players) halfway into Episode 2, and finally gave up the ghost (with my apologies) altogether at what I presume to be the end of Episode 3, leaving me with no idea how the damn thing ends.  Somehow, though, this lack of resolution probably enhances the quirky attractions of this odd absurdist story, and I haven't yet decided whether to return the DVD.  This is how Samuel Beckett would have written for Doctor Who.  Based on the one-second-on, twenty-second-pause, two seconds on, nature of how I was forced to view the final scenes of the last episode, I gather that Light (and what a truly marvelous character this is, a great pleasure just to behold this high-voiced, not really well acted, but irresistably glowing, frustrated cataloger of evolving Earth lifeforms) was somehow stopped just in the nick of time from destroying the house (and apparently South England and the rest of the world), but I have no idea how this happened, nor what became of Josiah (and who really cares what happens to Control, so long as she just goes away - to Java perhaps?)  Any denouement would have been an anticlimax.  While McCoy is no Olivier, he has a certain something in this darker, more withdrawn (or mousy) regeneration of the Doctor which is appealing in its way;  his acting seems to consist largely of pursed lips and rather lifeless mumbling, but it comes together in this ""actor proof"" role (to quote the great Tom Baker).  Ace is the star of this one, with superb support from the characters playing Josiah, Mrs. Pritchard and her daughter, Dr. Nettleton, and Nimrod.  The character Light owes considerably more to the special effects people than the actor, but what a memorable creation this is!  Originally, the script apparently made some sense (and seems to have been fairly routine Doctor Who, gathering from the director's plot summary offered as a special feature) before it was mercilessly chopped to fit into the required three-episode format for the show at this time, and yet in some perverse way, that adds to the enjoyment of the production.  I don't really care how the thing turns out, and for all I know, the film was supposed to pause and restart in this irritating (but suspenseful) manner. So many mysteries remaining unravelled in this schlocky plot: Were the night-emerging maids supposed to be human beings, mesmerized as the matriarch and her daughter, or were they some sort of evolved trilobites collected on Light's ship's earlier visit?  Why did Josiah's castoff husks still have the ability to flail about unconvincingly and respond to orders from Control?  Could Josiah evolve clothing as well as anatomy?  Why is Control's voice male in the first episode?  What was Ace being initiated into, exactly?  Why was the house still ""evil"" when Ace visited it 100 years later, long after Light fades, when she burned it down?  Were any or all of these mysteries resolved in the concluding moments of the melodrama?  This DVD is well worth looking into, and certainly fully entertaining - much more about the sheer joy of acting and of this great series, than about something so mundane as linear plotline!  Go get it, and don't tell me how it ends.",1141084800,6,4596,4.856041131105399

765758,4,6304052855,"This is one of those stories that turned me into a ""Star Trek"" fan.  Honestly.  My first golden age for loving ""Doctor Who"" came between the ages of 11 and 14.  After that I started to outgrow the show (until college), but still watched weekly PBS airings on autopilot.  I even survived ""Time and the Rani"", the first airing of which I found so painful that after 30 minutes, I turned off the TV and inventoried a cigar box full of the 1980 Topps baseball card set instead.  Who needs Bonnie Langford when you have Rick Langford in a kelly green baseball jersey?

I even managed to miss ""Ghost Light"" the one and only time my PBS station aired it.  I did, however, buy the novelization in 1990, and struggled through it.  The only positive thing I took away was Nimrod.  I even wrote an college admission essay about him (""Describe one historical person you'd like to spend an afternoon with"") and got accepted into SUNY Geneseo, although I didn't end up going there.

""Ghost Light"", when I finally caught up with it on late-night PBS in 1994, then had the honor of being the last of the complete ""Doctor Who"" episodes I saw -- even later than ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" -- until ""Rose"" came out on BitTorrent this year.

However, the DVD set of ""Ghost Light"" is a keeper.  Even if you don't like the story, the DVD provides enough grist for an amusing review (see all below entries).  The subtitles are a vast improvement on the US VHS release, the one where Control wanted her ""frames"".  The text commentary is by Martin Wiggins, not Richard Molesworth, so you know it's going to come out of left field with some great trivia.

Mark Ayres, of all people, turns out to be the MVP of the audio commentary, as he critiques his own score (and check out his above quote).  The talking over the first episode drags under a few too many unrelated anecdotes, but it improves when all involved announce, at the beginning of Part Two, that they're going to try to explain things.  I will say this is the fourth time I've seen the story (fifth, if you count the novelization), and I never knew exactly what Josiah's role in the survey team was supposed to be until last night.  It's also interesting to hear from Andrew Cartmel, who laughs so enthusiastically at the gruesome fate of episode straw man Rev. Ernest Matthews.  Can we please remake this episode with Sen. Bill Frist in that role?

The 45-minute making of feature intercuts interviews with the Doctor and Ace, Ayres and Cartmel, and four cast members.  Also well done is the edited Marc Platt convention panel from 1990 -- editing like this might have come in handy on the ""Curse of Fenric"" DVD!  The raw studio footage (""Shooting Ghosts"") reinforces just how tedious it must have been to be director Alan Wareing, who looks about as thrilled to be there as a retired police sergeant relegated to junior high school assistant principal.

One of my criteria for judging a work of fiction is: am I rooting for the bad guys?  If I am, it's good stuff.  The bad guys here are too much of a mixed bag.  Gwendoline's motivation from scene to scene connects together about as well as the color scheme in Tom Baker's scarf.  Granted, I like her song, but there's just no reason for her at the end of Part One to stop killing people long enough to play the piano for an audience of none.  Josiah never becomes a real threat, not in those Professor Horatio Huffnagle dark goggles.  Light could be called a human anticlimax, were he human.  The DVD extras do a good job of rehabbing Mrs. Pritchard, at least, as we see how painstakingly Wareing worked to get her into the frame.  However, I still wish Rev. Matthews had more to do, and survived further into the story, since John Nettleton did a great job with the role, and with the facial hair.  Any chance of recycling his sideburns into a sequel, guys?",1120867200,11,3845,4.511560693641618
765759,2,6304052855,"The restoration team, as always, managed to work wonders to make this story presentable...  Shot with poor quality cameras that weren't designed to handle low-light situations (hence the graininess), it's remarkable we got what we did.

But here's the problem:  I've been a WHO fan sicne 1978, at the tender age of 6.  Along comes 1989.  ""Ghost Light"" is the first story ever that I opted to watch at a later date because it was so uninvolved and unengaging.  I don't know why, especially as I managed to survive season 24 without any permanent brain damage and that season was terrible through and through.  And how that seasons 25 and 26 were geared toward a mid/late-teen audience rather than the 6 year olds the previous one had tried to court.  Of course, ""Time and the Rani"" is a fun enough romp (though being drunk on a nice cool lager helps considerably), but that review for another day...

So, along comes 1998.  I sit down to watch the episode I had taped 9 years earlier.  I thought it'd be a good idea to finally say ""I'm a dateless geek who's seen them all!""

And sure enough, I became a dateless geek that's seen them all... I somehow managed to sit through it.  I think I needed a drink beforehand and I surely did need to down a gallon of Long Island Iced Tea afterward; that always cheers me up...  when trying to watch a rendition of chickenscratch scripting, I think alcohol also helps to make even the most schizophrenic writing style that much more coherent...  This story isn't just lacking in the engaging category, the writing itself is either convoluted, sloppy, or both.  Let's just say ""both"" and the extra features allude to this inference as well...

I will say this story LOOKS incredibly good (since when does the BBC screw up a period piece anyway?  Even the original Doctor Who story, set during the time of the caveman, looked genuine...).

The music is also exceptionally good.  Indeed, I bought the standalone soundtrack when it was released in the early 1990s.  It's very atmospheric and creepy and worthy on its own.  Unfortunately, it can't make second-rate writing come across any better...

This story also cemented the notion (at the time) that the series (sarcastically by annoyed fans) needed to be renamed ""Ace Who"", given its focus on Ace rather than the Doctor.  (it's also ironic to point out that while late-80s Doctor Who is often criticized for giving the companion too much needless background info and development - and it was often needless, the new BBC series (2005) has taken a lot from this era and expanded greatly on it; with people calling it sensational and successful and a triumphant return.  Okey doke, having just said that it's time for me to mix a cocktail of my favorite hard liquors and drink 'til I drop:  Brandy, Whisky, Vodka, Drambuie, Tia Maria, Cointreau and Grand Marnier.  (thank you #6 for those choices!)  And if I can stomach watching ""Ghost Light"", you'll then understand it WILL take a gallon to get me to drop...

But I digress.  *hic*  There are some rather nice extras on this disc.  Especially a great commentary by cast and composer, even with the *hic* writer.  There's some insight here, but it's not the best commentary ever...

But if you think the 'deleted scenes' section will *hic* reveal any resolutions to this joke of a plot that makes ""Silver Nemesis"" seem like Royal Shakespeare by comparison, don't count on it.  *hic*

But while the storyline is about as coherent as *hic* an infant attempting to learn English, there are some nice lines - one in particular regarding humanity comes from the Doctor itself.  But the trouble is, set pieces and *hic* occasional lines of drool-worthy dialogue can't *hic* make up for a storyline that's a little too fresh from the cow pasture...  (hmm, drunk and retching on foul odors, how much worse can this get?)

Also, don't think that the documentary ""Light in Dark Places"" will be helpful; our mystery writer (it's a mystery that he became a writer) didn't show up for this one to explain it...  :-(  And, like the 75 minute story itself, this doco is also a bit too long.

This release is obviously for those fans who'll buy every release just for the sake of saying ""I have them all, nyah nyah nyah-nyah-nyah"" (like myself) or for the true fans of this story, of which there are many on both sides of the *hic* pond...

There, I think I'm *hic* sober again...

It's also been said that repeated viewings can help make sense of this, ahem, DISASTER.  This unfortunately goes back to the other point; who in their right mind could truly sit through this even more than once unless they were drawn in by its superficial elements and atypical, bizarre feel (ditto for the new Doctor Who series...)?

Get it on sale if you can, though the 20% off isn't what I'd call terrible.  For repeat viewings, for showing your friends as an example of fine quality Doctor Who (or, let's face it, even showing your worst enemies in an attempt to turn them into pillars of salt), this particular story isn't worth the money - but if you're a completist or a reeeeeeeeeeeeal fan of this story, it's worth every penny and then some.  As for me, I wouldn't likely even spend a penny on it, but then would I even think of confusing you with British slang?  :-)

(one little note:  You're more likely to enjoy my little review than you are when trying to watch the story, whose plot revolves around Ace, some one-liners featuring the Doctor, and some bafflegab regarding evolution...  it's just another form of sci-fi... and unlike most sci-fi, it's badly written out.  (and as a Christian myself, I could care less if evolution is real, if it's part of God's plan, or if it's a load of bunk.  Helping other people freely, in good faith, is why I am one.))",1120435200,8,5775,4.642998027613412
765760,5,6304052855,"Another pair of titles from the Doctor Who library hit the DVD stands and although drawn from different eras of the programmes lengthy history, there is (unusually) a strong connection between the two that makes them an ideal pair for simultaneous release.

The Leisure Hive from 1980 is the very first story to be produced and broadcast by the show's longest running producer, the highly controversial John Nathan-Turner. Ghostlight, made and broadcast nine years later was his last and indeed the last of the original series twenty-seven year run. It wouldn't be for another sixteen years that Doctor Who made it back onto UK screens in a regular series.

Seeing both shows again now really highlights quite clearly the long and drawn out demise of the original series and the reasons for the inevitable cancellation. When The Leisure Hive hit the UK's BBC1 on August 30, 1980, it was in many ways the dawn of a new era. The previous three years under the aegis of producer Graham Williams had seen the show degenerate into a rather slapstick version of itself with strong storylines often let down by weak production values, design and tongue-in-cheek performances from the assembled cast, including the lead actors themselves. With the departure of both Williams and script editor Douglas Adams (on his way to greatness with The Hitchhiker's Guides) a new broom literally swept through the programme and brought some much needed seriousness and higher production values to the show. The commentary by actress Lalla Ward (Romana), Lovett Bickford (the director) and Christopher H. Bidmead (the script editor) recalls many of the changes taking place at this time and other contributions from the costume designers, graphics, special effects gurus and musicians who worked to give the show a much needed overhaul, share in this sense of excitement and regeneration. But already the signs of the problems with the new producer are evident. As everyone involved with this DVD reluctantly admit, Nathan-Turner had a great eye for visuals and PR, but had very little regard for storylines or scripts. Or at least a sense of what would or wouldn't work. Indeed, the fact that the scripts for The Leisure Hive barely fill the required four twenty-five minute episode slots is indicative of his inability in this area.

Three Doctors later and Ghostlight features Sylvester McCoy as the Time Lord in the final death throes of a once great show. Here the problem is that the scripts are too long and far too complex for their intended broadcast length and savage cuts along the way during production only add to the show's mess. Again, the commentary (this time by actress Sophie Aldred (Ace), script editor Andrew Cartmel, musician Mark Ayres and author Marc Platt) goes a long way to revealing the behind the scenes problems in getting the programme to air.

But that's not to say there isn't a lot to enjoy in both of these stories. Ghostlight in particular has a lot going for it, as long as you don't try too hard to understand what's going on! The writer and editor are perplexed as to why anyone should be confused, whereas everyone else contributing to the DVD, including all the lead actors, make it clear they haven't a clue what's going on! The set design, acting and direction is really first rate and was a good example of Cartmel's vision for the show, trying to bring more mystery back into the character of the Doctor and the stories themselves. It's in many ways a shame that it proved to be the end of the road. The optimism of The Leisure Hive also makes for enjoyable viewing and again the design and guest cast make it a very watchable adventure.

For me, the most interesting, but also the saddest part of The Leisure Hive DVD is Lalla Ward's commentary. Opening her second season as Time Lady Romana, the show was made just months before her ill-fated and short-lived marriage to her co-star and Doctor number four, Tom Baker. Clearly, nearly twenty-five years later, she has a great deal of ill feeling towards her former husband and this spills out repeatedly as she describes the show for the DVD audience. Thankfully, the Ghostlight commentary helps explain what on Earth is going on, but in all honesty, I'm still none the wiser!

Great to see the Doctor Who collection growing on DVD and if you're a fan of the show, these will be invaluable additions to your collection. If you're not, there's a lot to enjoy here and it's well worth the entrance fee! As always, the effort put into the extras is in no way diminishing with various sound options and a slew of new interviews and out-takes available. But is it just me, or are the DVD covers for the Doctor Who series getting cheaper and nastier with each release?",1118534400,10,4737,4.813267813267813
765761,2,6304052855,"...which isn't saying much. I used to hate McCoy a long time ago and considered him to be the weakest of all the Doctors. He may still be but I don't hold him accountable. Stories like this prove the point. Ghostlight is atmospheric. But that's about all it has going for it. In the DVD extras, even the CAST admitted they didn't know what was going on. You kind of get the gist of the story but it is needlessly convoluted most of the time. Perhaps the biggest criminal involved here is the idiot who provided the music for the episode. The McCoy era's production team's biggest mistake was always their uncanny ability to lose dialogue under the incidental music. It was never a problem in any other Doctor's era, why was it during McCoy's? Everything was fine in scenes set in a studio when there was no music playing and you could hear the dialogue perfectly well, even through McCoy's sometimes THICK Scottish brogue. But all of a sudden, they turn the the mics down, the voices get lower, and crucial plot information is suddenly lost beneath incidental music. Even worse was shows like Fenric where they shot the entire thing on location and it was even TOUGHER to hear the dialogue. A sad time for the show as it was over run with unprofessional production people. Many people like this era. I think they simply don't know any better. McCoy and company thought they were just hitting their stride around this time and maybe they were but no one bothered to get them better sound people so it's probably for the best that it ended. Especially now that we have a new, well done series with Eccleston. Still if you were going to get a McCoy episode. This was better than his first season anyway.",1118448000,12,1700,4.54071661237785
765762,5,6304052855,"Dont let those one star reviews fool you.  What is so great about Doctor Who is that each new actor gives his own ""expression"" to the main title role.  Each new Doctor has his own quirks, his own shadows, his own mystery about him.  Think about it, there have been eight Doctors and that is wonderful.
While Tom Baker was a great Doctor, for example, he was only one of many Doctors.  I have to give Sylvester McCoy a standing ovation.  While I loved the Colin Baker stories, all of them, and I hated to see him end before he could truly shine, S MyCoy gives a new additive and a new dimension to the role of the Doctor.
The Doctor by now has returned to his mystery.  Just who is the Doctor? Just what is the Doctor?  Yes we think we know where he comes from, we think we know why he left his world.  But do we?  Do we indeed?  That's what's so great about Sylvester.  He's awesome as the Doctor.  He's funny and yet he can  be almost terrifying at the same time.  Think, for example, how comical he acts at first in the Greatest Show in the Galaxy, and yet suddenly he shows that he knows just what is happening and why.
Ghost Light is a wonderful additive to any and all Doctor Who collections.  The story is rich, it is advanced.  The story is haunting and so fast pace at times.  While I don't agree with the Evolution lauding of the storyline (as a Christian I am a Creationist), as a fiction story, I love how it is produced in the story.",1077494400,14,1445,4.15884476534296

If one was to describe the story in one word that word would be 'confusing'. The sets and guest cast are typically top notch for the BBC, however the plot appears to have gone missing in action. The direction is uneven and McCoy is not handled well. The viewer is left to piece together meaning from a few scaps of plot exposition.

7859705,5,6304052855,"Ghost Light.

Mention just the title to fans of Classic Who and you're likely to elicit a series of responses. For some, it's a compelling piece of work full of atmosphere and good dialogue. For others, it's a baffling mess of ideas string together across three episodes. For me, I fall into the former category rather than the latter. Why? Because Ghost Light might be the most deceptively complex Doctor Who stories ever made.

On one level, Ghost Light is an alien invasion story masquerading as a Gothic ghost story. All the elements for a Gothic tale are here: large spooky house, a strange and dominating male figure, a seemingly innocent young female, a menacing housekeeper, guests who are not what they seem, and family secrets all come into play. What makes Ghost Light unique is what writer Marc Platt and script editor Andrew Cartmel do with them by turning some of the tropes on their head (Gwendoline becomes both victim and villain for example) and by turning it not into a ghost story but into a tale of alien invasion that is largely contained to this one house. In fact, it might well be considered more in the vain of the Gothic genre than many of the tales from the era more than a decade before that is more generally associated with Doctor Who and that genre.

On another level, it's a tale about Victorian naturalists and evolution. Light in his way is a Victorian naturalist, cataloging different species and eventually coming to feel overwhelmed by what he's encountering (becoming a kind of conservative who wants everything to stay the same). Control and Josiah are evolution and science at work: Control being the experimental control who stays aboard and never changes while Josiah is a creature that goes out and adapts to the environment around him. Evolution plays a major role in the story, both in terms of dialogue but also in plot.

Speaking of dialogue, Platt's script bristles with references and wit. There's the occasional reference to the series' past with a brief reference to The Talons of Weng-Chiang and the works of Douglas Adams. There's literary references ranging from Henry James to George Bernard Shaw, and even pop culture references such as the Beatles. Platt also pokes fun at Victorian culture with characters such as the anti-evolutionary Reverend Matthews and a reference to one of the real-life examples of evolution pointed to in the era the story is set. The wit is on play as well with some wonderful one-liners that, along with the aforementioned references, makes this one of the most literary and humorous tales the series has ever produced.

Yet for all of that, it never loses sight of its characters. By both design and accident of scheduling, this was to become the first in a series of stories that developed the character of Ace and, indeed, in three episodes Ace got more character development than some companions had in multiple seasons just a few years before. Yet the Doctor is never too far away with Sylvester McCoy's Seventh Doctor firing on all cylinders playing master chess-player and unknowing clown, depending on whichever suits him.  Outside of the TARDIS crew, all of the characters here are richly drawn and superbly brought to life from Ian Hogg as Josiah, Sylvia Syms as the housekeeper Mrs Pritchard, and Michael Cochrane as Redvers Fenn-Cooper. It's a richly written tale, brought to life superbly.

All that being said, I stand by what I said in my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Platt-s-own-novelization/dp/0426203518/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Platt's own novelization</a>&nbsp;in 2011: Ghost Light works better as a novel than it does on-screen. What it needs, as my best friend said when we recently sat down and watched this, is a scene where Ace (or really anyone) sits the Doctor down and says What is going on here? Outside of that, it needs what Platt was able to do in the novel: have space for the story to breathe and be fully told. Perhaps if it had been an episode longer and hadn't needed to be cut down as much (the DVD features nearly a full episode's worth of deleted scenes) it would be a clearer tale. That said, the idea that the story is a baffling mess is unfounded as there are plenty of context clues and references made for viewers to follow the story, if not always totally understand why something is happening.

In the end, Ghost Light is far from your typical Doctor Who tale. It's a layered tale, full of incident and references that make it among the most literary tales the series has ever produced on screen. It's a story that shows that, even in the last days of its original run, the series still had legs to run with. Or, to put in another way, it was still evolving...",1488067200,2,4751,4.871287128712871

7859709,4,6304052855,"Ghost Light features one of Sylvester McCoy's performances as the Doctor and continued to portray the strong bond between this Doctor and Ace.  The story is atmospheric with a lovely Victorian setting and so many great spooky scenes.

However, this story suffers from some bizarre editing that makes it hard to follow at times. Any time to make sense of a story you have watch a commentary or read a novelization to just find out what went on, you have a problematic story. Same thing if a story is too long or too short. Some Pertwee stories might have been better an episode or two shorter but that's not the story we actually have. I really empathized with the Doctor when he started to get confused by the goings on in the final episode.

However, despite its faults, this is held together by everything strong and wonderful about it, namely the performances from the leads and the fascinating characters who will hold your attention even if a hard to follow storyline tempts your mind to wander.",1433289600,,1000,4.670454545454546

7859711,3,6304052855,"I came into the tail end of the original series of Doctor Who much like many fans these days (especially those from outside the UK), via DVDs. I remember watching the show off and on until Season 22 ended. I was only 7 at the time. My family had it on mostly to pass the time. When the show returned, none of us even knew about it. I suspect that was common outside of the UK for the casual fans.

The Doctor Who DVDs started sprouting up a decade ago and the treatment for each story was phenomenal. They were loaded with commentaries, documentaries, the works. Each release was like a Criterion Collection DVD. They were hard not to collect. I became a Whovian via the novels (Eater of Wasps did it) and went right to these.

The release order from the BBC was a mistake. I suspect they put it up to a fan vote because of the reputation this story has among fans. What the BBC should have done was release these in some sort of sequential order because alot is assumed to be understood by this, the third season of Sylvester McCoy's Doctor and the second for his companion Ace. The reason the Doctor and Ace are even in the mysterious house where all the action takes place is because of some trauma in Ace's past. The Doctor takes her there to confront the causes of it. The Doctor does this quite a bit in Season 26 because for the first time (ever?), the Doctor has complete control of where he can stir his TARDIS. He decides to be a child psychologist or a guidance counselor for troubled teens (even resembles a few). If you are new to the 7th Doctor. You don't pick up on much else if Ghost Light and the Curse of Fenric are your introduction to him.

The subplot of Ace's demons is meaningless if you start watching any of the 7th Doctor in the last season because you really don't see enough of the character to care. Ace is a departure from the usual companions because she has serious real life personal problems. She's a runaway, with a penchant for chemistry. She accidentally manages to blow herself up and land across the universe where she is marooned. In that story (see Dragonfire) Ace is given a proper introduction. That story was also clever in that additional characters appear different when you reflect them off of Ace's. A little girl on the planet makes you think what Ace was like as a child, the character Belazs makes you wonder where Ace will likely end up in 20 years if the Doctor where not a part of her life(Start there fans). In Ghost Light ,you don't care about Ace being in the house or why the Doctor takes her there without understanding her history. You also don't understand why the Doctor is doing this either. He does come across as an intergalactic psychologist without the background It's the same exactly with another poorly timed DVD release, The Curse of Fenric. While Sophie Aldred conveys the emotions and is given the lines to do so, the character is not weighted enough in the uninitiated's mind for it to carry the meaning implied.

The story is complex and that's fine. SPOILER ALERT (assuming I understood what I saw). A creature uses bodies to maintain his life, his constant change reminds the forces of Light (a character) how much he despises the changes that come with time. He seeks to change (ironically enough) all things that have changed over time back to their original form.

Then there's the story which is buried beneath something I can't forgive in this release and that is sound design. Dialogue should not be drowned out by incidental music. Trying to appreciate Ghost Light out of the blue is like trying to appreciate John Coltrane's Live in Japan in one full sitting without ever hearing the man play his alto sax before in your life. Having the dialog buried is something I hope the BBC is having corrected while this is out of print. It's no secret that the show was down to a bare minimum budget and production times were slashed. Sometimes shows can get away with that, Doctor Who was known for it ('All these corridors look the same to me Doctor"") this story however is sunk by them.

Another problem you can likely tie in to the shrunken budget is the fact this complex story is told in only three half hour episodes. Doctor Who used to run 26 half hour episodes a season, by the time it returned, the series was down to only 14 episodes. I wonder if things were unexpectedly altered to so to fit this into the 14 episode season calendar.

Mentioning all this now seems moot since Ghost Light and the Curse of Fenric are both out of print (in the US) and better starting points are in print and readily available (Dragonfire, even the Happiness Patrol) but if I can warn just one other person ahead of time, then the time was well spent.

The extras are great on this. The documentary fleshes out the script. There is also some sadness conveyed in it since this was the last original series Doctor Who story filmed in studio.

The BBC gave us DVDs introducing many, none obsessive Doctor Who fans to it's final original series Doctor with Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric and Ghost Light. The first is justifiably in print in the US. The other two, it's best to weight and let the Seventh Doctor and Ace settle into your mind. Learn how the Seventh Doctor operates a bit, develop feeling for his companion then enjoy. You will like this once you get to know them",1425859200,,5359,4.482581967213115
