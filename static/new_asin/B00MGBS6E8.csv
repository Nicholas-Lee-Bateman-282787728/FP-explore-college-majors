6577056,5,B00MGBS6E8,Always happy with Perry Mason DVD's.  One of my favorite series. Both the regular series and the Return series.  He was one of a kind and Raymond Burr was the perfect actor to play Perry Mason.,1416009600,,193,4.333333333333333

8672079,5,B00MGBS6E8,"Excellent condition. It is cheaper to buy the 12 Double Feature sets than to buy the larger 6 movies sets. If you are a Perry Mason fan, these are a must for your collection. And the sets are produced in order of when each movie was shown. I will be watching these often.",1435881600,,271,4.132075471698113
