912661,4,6304680465,"The Hideous Sun Demon is an overlooked winner from the legendary canon of 50s science fiction/monster movies. The eponymous ""sun demon"" is actually quite impressive and hideous indeed, a reptilian nightmare on two legs and, in a neat twist, summoned forth by the rays of the sun. Robert Clarke does a yeoman's job as not only the lead character--a flawed but likable young scientist who finds himself cursed with a monstrous alter ego after being exposed to atomic radiation--but also as the director. Indeed, the entire cast is quite proficient, and everyone acquits themselves honorably in their respective roles, particularly the gorgeous Nan Peterson who plays an especially curvaceous barroom singer that catches the troubled protagonist's eye. The film is quite well-paced with a good mix of action and drama, and the characters are all realistically developed as believable individuals. The special effects are handled nicely, and the scenes of monster mayhem are surprisingly brutal and pack quite a nasty punch. The ultimate climax is perhaps inevitable, but nonetheless exciting and expertly staged. Often neglected in conversations of 50s genre classics, The Hideous Sun Demon is a fine example of monster movie excellence.",1437955200,,1234,5.398963730569948

912733,2,6304680465,"This short film suffers from poor sound quality and poor photography. It starts well as a psychological study of a lonely man who is forced to live alone at night as radiation has changed his cell structure so that he becomes a lizard monster during the day time. This scientist, Gil, is also a womanizing alcoholic whose impulses get him into bar fights, abandoning a woman on the beach, crashing cars, and so forth. The film goes over the well-trod Jekyll-Hyde motif in which as the lizard man he becomes violent, homicidal, and runs around a lot. 50 minutes into the movie it ceases to be a psychological study and becomes a one-dimensional monster on the loose film. It ends badly, with the lizard man shot and falling from a huge tank. It is hard to have any sympathy for Gil McKenna, as he cannot help going into a bar and getting into trouble even after previous bad experiences in that bar. Obviously the scientist was a compulsive party boy. The science used to explain it all is Darwinian evolution in reverse, including a completely unnecessary explanation of how a fetus evolves in the womb to other scientists who should already know all that. All absurd and poorly presented. Based on an idea by Robert Clarke, produced and directed by Robert Clarke through his own company, and starring Robert Clarke.

912778,5,6304680465,"We never get to see the accident that turns Dr. Gilbert McKenna (Robert Clarke) into THE HIDEOUS SUN DEMON.  More's the pity, I would have enjoyed that, instead, it's presented as hearsay, the result of a hangover.  Basically, the slander has it that Dr. Gil is a drunk and clumsy.  His bad luck continues; the poor sot is maltreated in a hospital to a moment in the sun.  The consequences are catastrophic.  But all is not lost there might be a cure, if allowed to experiment on him.  ""Half human, half lizard and I'm a guinea pig..........!""  Apparently, he also can't make up his mind as to what he's become.  (Loved the extreme close-up of his anguished puss, you could count ever pore!)  Naturally, he soon contemplates an act of desperation.  How handy, a cliff nearby.  Instead of jumping, he does the very thing that got him into this mess, goes to a bar and drinks himself silly.  Ooo-la-la there's a lousy lounge singer to ogle.  (Here's a tip, can I chuck change into your cleavage?)  Of course a bar brawl ensues.  Gil escapes with the singer.  They park and he whips out his flask.  ""You're a strange guy.""  (And you're a cheap floozy, race ya to the beach!)  As day will follow, the sun comes up forcing poor Gil to escape...........in a convertible......ditching the lounge singer with just his coat and a smile on her face.  The poor dear had to hitch home.
Being a creature of habit, Gil will keep changing at inopportune moments and soon becomes a dog killer!  He also dispatches a rather unpleasant thug and throws a fit of hysterics.  ""I couldn't help myself, I murdered someone, I wanted to kill him!""  (Back off, I'm after an Oscar!)  Well, you can't murder someone without a tally being taken.  Things do not turn out well for poor Gil.

I have to confess that I loved this film.  I haven't laughed this hard in ages.  It was as lousy as claimed and I couldn't be the happier for it.  It's definitely going in my collection with the rest of the unfortunate duds.  (It's nice when someone else's mistake can prove to be a cause for joy.)",1374019200,2,2059,4.5013550135501355

912783,3,6304680465,I always loved these cheesy horror/sci fi flicks from the fifties. This one is one of those and remains alot of fun to watch today. As the sun turns a scientist into a scaly monster. THe monster looks pretty cool actually and would make a good comic book villian. The hulk could fight him! But seriously a sci fi fan who doesn't love old stuff may not find this to their liking as it's a cheap flick from the fifties. I still enjoy it's low budget charm and decent acting. the picture quality is ok here and I think the version with elvira as the host looks a little better. But she pops into the movie and that's not cool. ALthough; I do enjoy her premovie narration.  This is for vintage low budget sci fi fans for sure.

912784,3,6304680465,"Panic in the streets!

After the obligatory sci-fi introduction of what is about to plague us we find that Dr. Gilbert McKenna (Robert Clark) had a slight radiological accident. Prior to this accident Dr. McKenna was a known lounge lizard. Now when the sun shines he becomes a true lizardlike creature with rubber mask and all. How will he be able to cope with this? What will his friends think? And the local police have plans of their own.

Producer and actor Robert Clark, of whom you may remember from ""The Man from Planet X"", takes us on a tour of Los Angeles. We go on a fun romp through sunny Southern California. Just looking at the 1959 technology and early pictures of Signal Hill are worth the film in itself. I also imagine that I could've maybe seen the hideous Sun Demon as I too lived in the area and was on signal Hill in 1959.

There are two things memorable about this movie.  One is when he's in his lizard persona he squeezes some poor little rat to show how evil he truly is. The other is that Patricia Manning's screams are seldom rivaled.",1294444800,,1061,4.3979591836734695

912843,4,6304680465,"I enjoy these old, low-budget monster films and find Hideous Sun Demon to be a real favorite. No, the acting's not good, and the effects are unspectacular by today's standards, but there was an attempt here to craft something of value from modest materials. Underlying a pretty standard plot are suggestions about the opposites that pull at our protagonist: night vs. day, the brunette good girl vs. the blond singer, and drunkeness vs. sobriety. Is the sun a harsh moral judgement of some kind? That may be a stretch, but what symbolism there is suggests a level of thoughtfulness and a seriousness of intent uncommon to many of these films.  If 50s sci-fi/horror is your thing, don't miss this one.",1264982400,,700,4.833333333333333
912844,4,6304680465,"One thing you can say for the sci-fi/horror films of the 50s, is that they really knew how to come up with a snazzy title.  Where today's films try to shorten the title as much as possible(the cool sounding ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" on it's 100th remake is now simply ""Invasion""), the classic schlockers tried to make it as grandiose as possible.  Some films made a point to tell us where the film's creature was coming from, be it ""outer space"" or ""beneath the sea"", etc.  Then there's a few that liked to throw in an adjective to describe the ""monster"" of the film-We know the shrinking man is ""incredible"" or that the she-monster is ""astounding"".  And the sun demon?  Well, he's hideous!  How'd he get that way?  Well, he's actually Dr. Gilbert McKenna(Robert Clarke in a kind of schlock Clint Eastwood mode, taking on both starring role and director duties).  McKenna drops some experimental isotope(he was hungover.  McKenna has a weakness for the sauce) and infects himself with some wacky form of radiation.  Now somehow, his cells regress back to their prehistoric origins and he turns into a kind of homicidal lizard man.  It's kind of like a reverse werewolf curse as this only happens when he's exposed to sunlight.  Scientists try to isolate McKenna and figure out how to cure him, but this is a monster movie, and we know that McKenna will manage to slip up and end up in the sunlight.  His love of the booze helps out in this as he becomes smitten with a nightclub singer and ruffles the feathers of some Al Capone type gangster dude(though he reminds me more of that little gangster with the big hat from the Bugs Bunny cartoons).  So when the sun demon isn't out terrorizing folks and brutally killing dogs, he's either being poked by scientists, poking the nightclub singer or boozing it up.
The Hideous Sun Demon is one of the more entertaining of it's kind.  The film's soundtrack will sound familiar as it's the same music used in Romero's Night of the Living Dead.  The sun demon himself, while obviously cheap, is still one of the cooler looking monsters from the 50s.

912846,4,6304680465,"I expected this to be far worse than it was. (Possibly Nan Peterson has something to do with the fact that I actually liked watching this.)

But like most 50's sci fi, don't go in hoping for logic, good special effects (the monster provoked a laugh every time he was on camera), scientific accuracy (this is about as bad as it gets in that department, rivaling Plan Nine), character development (is it me, or did all 50's women fall in love with the first troubled soul they met?) or believable acting. It's solid cheese all they way through. And yes, fun.

Things I learned from this movie:

If you seduce a blonde you just met, vanish before she wakes up, and don't call afterwards, the next time you see her she'll be vaguely annoyed, but she'll take you back to her apartment anyway, and then act like nothing ever happened. You don't have to explain a thing.

Pretending to punch someone knocks them flying, no matter how obviously the punch is faked.

Notes an octave apart are about two feet apart on a piano. (Watch the singer's fake piano playing, it's the worst I've ever seen.)

Radiation isn't just a matter of alpha, beta and gamma. *Some* isotopes are different. Really different. You won't believe how different.

Chase a monster and it heads straight for the most obvious dead end it can find.

912847,5,6304680465,"Robert Clarke has got to be the forgotten star of 50's sci-fi classics! John Agar and Richard Denning are the big two, and even Peter Graves is quite noticible. But Robert (MAN FROM PLANET X, ASTOUNDING SHE MONSTER, BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER) Clarke seems to go unnoticed as a major star of the genre.
THE HIDEOUS SUN DEMON should have propelled Clarke right to the top! It's certainly his CITIZEN KANE as he produced, directed and starred in this prime example of low budget b&w 50's sci-fi drive-in fare.
And a classic it is! Clarke plays Gil the stumble drunk atomic scientist who drops his radioactive isotope and becomes exposed to it's effects, which now means that whenever Gil steps out into the sunlight he becomes Gil-man the reptilian monster who likes to crush rats and kill dogs and make love to a big chested blonde who sings in a dubbed voice and plays a wicked piano!
Lots of cool noirish night scenes, cigarette smoke, sleazey bars and a fierce beating. Lots of blazing sun, sweaty rubber suited monster scenes and a tragic ending for Gil.
The Image dvd has a few scratches, some speckling, but is quite clear, some shots looking as though they could have been filmed yesterday...and all those 50's cars and street scenes!
Again, a great example of this kind of stuff! Some funny moments, but mostly pretty effective. A great looking dvd and a good buy.

They did a pretty good job as having a full length rubber suit that fits into his pants so you get the feeling it is the whole body that is a reptile. The poor guy knocks over things and gets nuclear particles into his body. The sun turns him into a monster after being exposed for a short length of time. He is a monster for a short time until he can get out of the sun. It keeps getting worse as time goes by. He does a little over acting at times like William Shatner did as Captain Kurk. The end scenes have the ""top of the world ma"" similarities from ""White Heat"". Very good fight scenes at the end. He does a lot of great butt kicking in the movie as the monster. He does not make Peta happy either as he kills a dog who was chasing him. He gets so involved with a big chested blond, he forgets about the sun coming up in the morning on the beach. Man does he catch hell for ditching her and getting home as quick as he can. It is like a vampire getting to his coffin and beating the sun coming up. The song the gal does will haunt you for months. Check out his wet pants from sweating from the rubber suit underneath his clothes as he climbs the tower to get away from the cops. It is worth the money to buy this dvd.

912885,4,6304680465,"well, sort of! This wonderfully bad man/lizard flick contains some surprisingly creative camera work. The story is of interest as it plays up the psychological ramifications of the atomic-exposure-gone-wrong story line. Robert Clarke stars, directs and produces so he's totally responsible for this thing, if you like it or if you absolutely adore it. And oh yeah! he gets to kiss all of the young women! How convenient!

So, what we have here is a drunken atomic scientists who drops a vial of some never existed before atomic something which knocks him unconscious. Little Frustrated Assistant isn't exposed but still manages to see the whole thing. Things are looking OK for the doc (if only he'd stop drinking!) in the hospital until he gets set outside with the other potted plants where he shrivels up into a comically scaly-chested lizard man! He goes to hide out in a gothic mansion, coming out at night only to drive too fast and drop into the same scabrous dive where the woman with one useable arm flops around in front of a piano. Needless to say, it's love. Things go awry. A famous doctor comes around to cure him (the mind boggles) but not before he goes off again to canoodle with the floozy. More bad stuff happens, he misjudges a ""trooper dusting"" and snatches a little girl. Really! I'm not making it up!

912888,2,6304680465,"The premise of ""The Hideous Sun Demon"" is intriguing, but unfortunately this low-budget 1959 film fails to deliver. The central idea here is that an accidental radiation overdose causes a scientist (Robert Clarke) to morph, or ""de-evolve,"" into a scaly reptilian monster whenever he is exposed to sunlight. There are many interesting directions that the filmmakers could have taken this concept, but none of them show up in the film. In the end, ""The Hideous Sun Demon"" is like an episode of ""Seinfeld""--it's really about nothing at all.

Some of today's sophisticated viewers may chuckle at the rubber creature costume, but I have no complaints about the ""special effects."" By the standards of the day, and considering the small production budget, the monster is actually nicely detailed and quite convincing, for the few brief moments that it appears on-screen. The crisp black-and-white photography is also excellent, featuring some striking, stark, deeply shadowed ""noir-like"" scenes that look great in this full-screen digital transfer. There are some muddy scenes in which day turns into night through the miracle of gross underexposure, but that technique was common at the time. The biggest problem with ""The Hideous Sun Demon"" is that there is no meaningful story, and essentially no character development. You never get to the point where you care about the scientist, the monster or anyone else.

On balance, ""The Hideous Sun Demon"" is not a bad film--it's just not much of a film at all. It's easy to watch, reasonably well-made and the DVD is relatively cheap. Completists can certainly justify buying it to round out their collection of 1950s sci-fi movies. By the way, despite the fact that it is supposed to include ""liner notes and personal recollections by producer/director/writer/star Robert Clarke,"" there was nothing in the case I received except the DVD.",1172448000,6,1877,5.211920529801325

Maybe it's just my imagination but it seems like it always came on during the late afternoon when the sun was still shining brightly.

That's the interesting aspect of the story. It ties in with the mysterious, awesome power of the sun.

The location is a typical American small town from the 50s which is also interesting.

The sun demon looks very similar to the monster in:

For those who appreciate classic b movies from the 50's and 60's this movie is for you,for those who like saw and really modern mainstream horror movies stay away by all means....... this is not your type of movie.",1141603200,,364,4.2898550724637685
912891,2,6304680465,"Robert Clarke plays a scientist who's been over-exposed to a new radioactive isotope.  Now whenever he's exposed to the sun, his cells revert to an earlier evolutionary stage, turning him into a hideous lizard-man.  He doesn't want to stay in the hospital or around any people, so he isolates himself at home by day, and goes out to the bar for drinks at night - a habit he couldn't break even before his radiation-condition.  At the bar he meets a pretty girl and, too intoxicated to remember his codition, takes her to the beach for a midnight swim.  The time gets away and before you know it the sun's coming up.  He abondons the girl and speeds home just in time.
A radiation specialist comes to help, but in the meantime Clarke sneaks out to the bar again and trouble - the girls boyfriend, a mean big thug, beats him up.  The girl takes him home, but her boyfriend shows up again by daylight and forces him outside, where you can guess the rest.  In case you can't guess, he turns hideous and kill the boyfriend, and spends the rest of the movie on the lam, and hideous.
The plot is nothing new, like several dozen other movies before it.  Clarke also directed, competently, but some of the acting is pretty bad (far from the worst though, compared to some other cheap sci-fi flicks). The monster make-up isn't the worst either, but nothing special.  The most telling sign of the low budget is the echo in the soundtrack, like there was one microphone off in the corner of the room.
Overall the movie was just good enough to keep me interested, but I'm the kind of guy who'll watch anything.  It's not as corny as an Ed Wood movie, but not as interesting either.  Worth a look if you're a true sci-fi fan or movie buff who needs to see 'em all at least once, but there are a lot of better movies out there, like Dr. Cyclops, The Monolith Monsters, Panic In Year Zero . . .",1117065600,3,1878,4.367816091954023
912892,3,6304680465,"Aside from its delirious title, this movie's most intriguing attribute is the fact that it was co-written, co-directed and produced by its star, Robert Clarke. To call it an auteurist project might be somewhat far-fetched, but this is about as personal as a low budget science-fiction film can possibly be. The way it blends several genres - sci-fi, horror, film noir - and B-film conventions (notably the curse of the werewolf) is odd and generally successful. The title creature manages to stand out in the massive crowd of 1950s monsters for three reasons: 1) it actually looks very good, 2) its appearances are judiciously scattered throughout the film, and 3) these scenes are directed with a keen sense of pace and suspense. There is little doubt that Clarke's elliptical storytelling is partly due to the minimal budget, but it is artistically rewarding as well: the abrupt introduction, the first transformation scene and the final showdown are impressive and memorable, true highlights among 1950s B-films. This endearingly modest creature feature should be seen.",1089590400,8,1072,5.238372093023256
912893,3,6304680465,"""The Hideous Sun Demon"" is one of those quintessential shoestring sci-fi schlockers that is so bad it's good.
When a scientist is exposed to new radioactive isotope (as is so often the case in these movies), he then becomes allergic to sunlight; the side effect being that he devolves into a lizard-man and kills people. Full of booze and paranoia, our hero takes up with a saloon singer while his sweetheart is left to fret.
Silly science and lots of fiction (and skimpy budget), prevents this particular cautionary tale against ""tampering with the Unknown"" from being in a league with other radiation-based monster movies. There are some great scenes (mostly with the monster lying in wait to attack), but be ready for some over-the-top acting (and just plain bad acting by some inexperienced cast members!), and some el-cheapo effects work.
The filmmakers do make up for a lack of budget with some creativity and imagination, but what really saves this little film is the excellent use of location shooting. Real-world venues take center stage (especially during the climactic oil tank battle hundreds of feet high up), with startling footage of oil pumps, tank farms, and girders that easily make us overlook any weaknesses in acting or effects. And to be honest, the rubber suit and mask are pretty effective.
You'll have fun with this one, as long as you aren't expecting a slick big-budgeter. While far from perfect, you can tell that everyone involved really made an effort to make the movie as fun and as exciting as they could.
The DVD comes with liner notes and the trailer, and the print is in pretty good shape.",1074729600,13,1624,4.866425992779783
912894,1,6304680465,"This one is kind of a werewolf in reverse. Due to a dose of radiation, a scientist turns into a lizard man when exposed to sunlight. I kept waiting for something to happen. The monster looked ok for a rubber suit type creature but the movie moved pretty slowly to a predictable ending. A couple of cuties were the decoration and love interests (yes two of 'em)in this hollywood effort. The picture quality went from ok to terrible,then back to ok, as did the sound.",1033084800,4,465,4.482352941176471

I could tell you it's 'so bad it's good.' But that wouldn't really fill you in, as such a statement can be interpreted many ways by many different people.
There are also a surprising number of things the film manages to do competently. Listing those to someone contemplating purchasing this dvd might even be counterproductive. So I will refrain.
The simplest, most telling review I can write is this:
The star, Robert Clarke, while wearing the rubber Sun Demon costume during filming in the hot Southern California sun, sweated profusely. The sweat ran down his torso and to his trousers. This gives the appearance during the latter stages of this movie that the Hideous Sun Demon was unable to control his bladder.

When going out into the sun for a ""tan"", he turns into the Hideous Sun Demon,  it's a kind of Jekyll and Hyde tranformation in the sense that when he turns into this monster he starts to lose it. This movie is boring, trust me I have seen enough classic horror films and I have the right to call this one boring(I am not saying classic horror films are boring if that the impression you got). This movie just doesn't have that creepy atmosphere that the Universal classic horror collection had, not at all, nothing ever really sets the mood in this film either, it could have been great, I loved the idea and the design of the monster still remains one of my all-time favorites but I just didn't find myself enjoying this, maybe Robert Clark shouldn't have tried to do too much at once. I loved the design of the navigation menu, it looked really classic, there is a trailer for your viewing pleasure, enjoy at your own risk. The Hideous Sun Demon!

912930,4,6304680465,"1959 was a benchmark year for schlock horror classics. This flick has all the elements that make movie cheese so endearing to true fans. A sure sign of a real classic, the star of the movie, Robert Clarke, is also the writer, the producer, and the director. A scientist suffers accidental exposure to radiation. In a variation of the classic werewolf theme, sunlight makes Gil break out in a lizard shirt and horrific head mask. His metamorphosis leads to violent behavior. Gil meets a low rent Marilyn Monroe ... lounge-singer named Trudy (as in a ""true D-cup,"" subtlety abounds). He sniffs around her by night, but then the sun rises and he is off again on more mayhem that is decidedly violent. The film has typical stairwell quality sound, dismal B&W photography, and ersatz science pontifications (""Darwin was never even close!""). True to low budget traditions, instead of movie studio sets, the cast and crew ventured out on the streets of L. A. to film this epic. Gil has a date with destiny high atop a huge oil storage tank, shades of Jimmy Cagney. There is a determined effort to create a sense of tragedy in Gil's sad fate. In spite of its cheap look, this film is slightly better than average, very slightly. The Elvira Mistress of the Dark edition includes her hilarious introduction and epilogue. The delectable B Queen offers plunging comments and well-rounded remarks in a pointed and thrusting manner. Taken as a whole, it's good fun, in a reverse sort of way. ;-)",1012521600,,1481,4.766536964980545
912931,4,6304680465,"Hideous Sun Demon, Robert Clarke's auteurist tour-de-force, aims for high drama but achieves drive-in monsterama cool instead. Apparently conceived as a sensitive portrayal of the inner torment of a man possessed by a strange condition beyond his control, they just didn't have the budget to bring it off. Besides, it's hard to work up sympathy for a character who, after being told by his doctor to stay home and not drink any alcohol, immediately heads out to the bar. Then there's the bosomy b-girl who's just had her boyfriend and his thugs work over our hero, who turns around and starts consoling him and takes him home. But the illogic's half the fun of this movie, and anyhow, we're really here for the cool Blaisdell-esque rubber Sun Demon, the rat-squishing, and Clarke's over-the-top performance. For cheese lovers there's plenty of bad acting and that let's-talk-about-it-cause-we-can't-afford-to-show-it thing going on. Giving credit where it's due, however, several locations are exploited for some interesting visuals. Basically, another fun hour-and-ten for the bad cinema set.
Image's DVD presents the movie in the best edition I've seen yet. The source print is not flawless; there are a half dozen or so short (15 sec) stretches of distracting horizontal scratching, some intermittent light vertical scratching, and the usual very light to light speckling and spotting throughout. But overall it  looks quite good; sharp and detailed, with generally excellent tonal values. Other than the horizontal scratches, it blows the socks off my Starlog Video VHS copy, and if you're used to catching this on the late night monster shows you'll probably be quite pleased. Minimal extras include 12 chapter stops and the trailer (not in as nice shape as the movie). A solid value for the money.",1003795200,3,1803,5.2172413793103445

912936,4,6304680465,"Well, now, from the cover of this one, you'd think that this was lower down on the evolutionary scale than plankton. Actually, it falls somewhere between the whole-heartedly ""serious"" sci-fi flicks of the 50s  (like ""Them!"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"") and  the **real** bottom-of-the-barrel stuff like ""The Amazing Colossal  Man"" and ""Beast From the Haunted Cave"". True, true, you do  have to have a taste for cheese to really enjoy these things, and this one  doesn't disappoint. Our hero is quite the booze-hound, but that didn't keep  his friend from recommending him for his current job (somewhat unclear -  apparently it involves unloading isotope bars off of a toy railroad...! )  One day, he shows up to work with a hangover (his loyal assistant insists  it was ""just a headache""!), and the next thing he knows - he's  been exposed to ""5 or 6 minutes"" of radiation. That's enough -  remember, this was made back in the days when anyone capable of using the  words ""isotope"" and ""radiation"" in the same sentence  was definitely some kind of Poindexter.
The interesting thing about this  film (besides the rubber-suited lizard man) is that it doesn't seem to  matter to anyone that, hey!, we have this guy who turns into a Hideous Sun  Demon, and they don't keep him around for observation. ""Just stay out  of the sun."" Okie-dokie! Good news is that he's still  very much the  booze-hound, and therefore we get to spend time following him around,  looking for bars at night - looks downright noirish for a while, and by all  means stick around for the stacked blonde singing the ""Love Song From  Hideous Sun Demon"", aka ""Strange Pursuit"" (what a title!  What a song! What kind of piano is that woman playing, anyway? )
Still,  our director and star did his best with this one - some of the scenes are  really well composed (there's one scene near the beginning that looks as  though Ansel Adams could have shot it) and it has a far more polished feel  to it than SO many of these movies. (Ugh - if you haven't sat through a  Francis Coleman movie, you have no right to pass judgement on THIS one!)  The DVD transfer is completely acceptable (what, you're waiting for the  widescreen edition? I don't think so....) even if it doesn't really have  any extras (other than the liner notes, which put the whole thing into  perspective). There's some film scratchiness but mostly it's pretty decent  B&W - not too washed out, not too contrasty. It even has the  usually-deleted ""rat scene"" (you'll know what I'm referring to as  soon as you see it).
All in all - I recommend it to ANY fans of the  genre. Not as well known as a lot of the familiar turkeys, better than most  of them if not overly-ambitious or special in any way. A prime slice of the  genre, best enjoyed with a rainy Saturday afternoon or a couple of friends  for riffing purposes. Have fun!",955324800,24,2867,4.601980198019802
