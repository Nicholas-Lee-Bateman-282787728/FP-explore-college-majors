1665427,5,B00005UJY8,"Electra is a 1962 black and white adaptation of the version of the story from Euripides.  Electra (Irene Pappas) and Orestes take revenge on King Aegisthos and on their mother, Queen Klytemnestra, for killing their father, King Agamemnon. [It's interesting to compare ""Electra"" with ""Hamlet"".]
The movie is very close to the play.  The main difference is an added portrayal of the arrival and murder of Agamemnon and the rescue of the young Orestes.  Also, the death of Aegisthos now comes at a festival for Bacchos, rather than at a service to honor the Nymphs.  These changes make sense for a modern audience.
Euripides is well served by the excellent acting and by the psychologically-correct bleak, isolating landscapes.  It even looks as though the scenes at Mykenai may have been done on site.  (The end credits are all Greek to me.)
(If the movie were remade to day, one might be tempted to have a computer-generated Palace.  If one wanted to be historically accurate,  the film maker might have had to partially reverse the severe soil erosion that accelerated the relative decline of the Argos area.)
While it is difficult to know why such a cloud of black-clothed women would hang around Electra's house in such a sparsely populated land, the handling of the Greek chorus is well done.
The movie can be heard in Greek, English, or French.  There are subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.  The music is small- scale Near Eastern. The only extra is the original theatrical trailer.
It is a classic movie from a classic source, given classic acting.",1018396800,68,1561,4.878787878787879
1665429,5,B00005UJY8,"Powerful and beautiful rendition of Euripides' Electra. Irene Papas is majestic and riveting.  The beauty of the stark landscape, sensitive chorus and costumes are fantastic.  Beautiful black & white photography.",1412121600,,212,6.033333333333333
1665430,4,B00005UJY8,"This black and white classic gives a modern feel
to an ancient play.
The acting, costuming  and casting are all very good.
There are no masks and this doesn't give a chorus
type of feel to the play,
but it puts the play in some historical perspective as a tragedy.
Culturally these were supposed to be more like opera with
masks than a more modern Shakespearean tragedy.
We might benefit from more such productions.",1364515200,,415,4.608108108108108
1665431,5,B00005UJY8,"I sent Electra to a Japanese friend who saw it forty years ago and had been searching for it ever since.
He was as thrilled with it now as he was then.  ""Suburashii"" - Excellent!",1296950400,3,178,4.085714285714285
1665432,5,B00005UJY8,"Michael Cocoyannis has created a powerful interpretation of Euripides' tragedy, ""Electra."" The stark black-and-white cinematography mirrors the stormy emotions of the protagonists, Electra and her brother, Orestes. The movie was filmed in Greece, on site at Mycenae; indeed, the cyclopian blocks of the gate of the lions, the so-called ""treasury of Atreus,"" the ""tomb of Clytemnestra,"" and the rock-strewn Peloponnesian countryside provide a striking backdrop for the superbly-directed drama.

There is so much about this production to be praised. Foremost is Irene Papas. Even when she is silent, Papas, her hair shorn in mourning, exudes a bitter passion for her slain father, Agamemnon, which is as intense as her hatred of her mother, Clytemnestra; on a psychological level, Papas' portrayal personifies the so-called ""Electra complex."" And yet, she underplays the role; one feels that her emotions are smoldering just beneath the surface. Giannis Fertis, the young man who portrays Orestes, has a profile that resembles a hero on a Greek Red-figured vase. Although not quite the equal of Papas, he is nevertheless convincing. A hair-raising moment for the audience comes after the two, who adore each other, recognize the enormity of their crime and its consequences.

The evocative musical score of Mikis Theodorakis enhances the drama, as does the chorus of women, who, like Papas, are eloquent in their silence, as they watch the tragedy unfold. With their black veils billowing in the wind, they stand on the hillside like ominous sentinels--suggesting the inevitability of the tragedy and foreshadowing the black-winged Furies who will eventually hound Orestes.

View this splendid film with the Greek sound and the English subtitles. It may not be everyone's cup of tea (My son would probably do an Orestes, if I tried to play it on his immense HD screen--reserved for action flicks in color only!). For discerning viewers, however, who enjoy fine cinema and superb acting, ""Electra"" will not disappoint.",1269907200,3,2015,5.370253164556962
1665433,4,B00005UJY8,"I enjoyed the acting in this very interesting film. It was refreshing to view a film untainted by the worn out formula of graphic sex, violence, explosions and vulgarity. However, this movie has a portion of sexual tension and violence at its base, like a greek tragedy should.  Good acting and lots of options with subtitles and dubbing. If you're not in the mood for this radical departure, you may not like it. But I was hungry for a change of pace and this delivered nicely. I got so absorbed in the acting I felt like I was in the presence of the actors. There are a couple over-acted scenes and offbeat background music on occasion, but not enough to detract from the overall acting or interfere with the storyline.  It was also gratifying to see the treachery of Electra's adulterous mother, the queen, who has her lover kill the returning king in the beginning of the story come back to her in spades when Electra and her brother exact their revenge years later.  The confrontation between Electra and her mother, 16 years after her father's murder, is very well-acted and a bit spell-binding.  It was a neat movie with a neat plot that I'll watch again and again.",1219190400,7,1172,4.5933014354066986
1665434,4,B00005UJY8,"I show this film to high school students and after they get past the relatively crude production values, English subtitles and strange music, they begin to sense the power of the story. The intensity of the characters becomes almost hypnotic and the fact that this is a really old film becomes unimportant. My only regret is the story is closer to the Sophocles/Aeschylus versions that show the traditional endorsement of revenge killings. The revolutionary antiestablishment undertone of the Euripides text is ignored despite the fact that it raises timeless questions these actors could have explored to great effect.",1197417600,12,619,5.326530612244898
1665435,4,B00005UJY8,"Bitterness in ancient Greece.  If you go for Greek tragedy you'll enjoy this.  Agamemnon returns home to Mycenae, is murdered by his wife and her lover, and his daughter Elektra schemes revenge.  The real Mycenae stands in for itself and the acting is top-notch.  Regarding this DVD: beware of using the dubbed English track - the voices don't always say what they should at certain points.  Also, the great Irene Papas' powerful voice is ""girlie-fied"" by whoever dubbed her.  Stick to the original Greek track and access the English subtitles instead.  The film is in 16:9 format but is not anamorphic.  This is not a problem due to the excellent b & w transfer, and no serious graininess is introduced when it is vertically expanded to fit your widescreen TV screen.  Recommended.",1123718400,18,782,4.863636363636363
1665436,5,B00005UJY8,"Irene Papas as Elektra gives probably her finest perfomance ever. Cacoyanis made an exceptional translating process with this drama from Euripides.
The fundamental atmosphere of the female chorus and all the haunting drama hidden about the revenge to make justice is told
brilliantly.
Cacoyanis shows us why he was blessed by the Gods .
Acquire this superb masterpiece.",1085529600,7,369,5.379310344827586
1665437,5,B00005UJY8,"Interesting that this 1962 film's director, Michael Cacoyannis, also directed Zorba the Greek and that the latter film also starred Irene Papas who plays the title character in Electra.  It easily demonstrates Cacoyannis' artistry as a director, for in this film, he does a masterful job of interpreting the Euripides drama.
Filmed naturalistically in Greek settings, Electra does not disappoint.  The great hero and king Agamemmnon is brutally murdered near the beginning of the story by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus.  Electra and her brother Orestes, children of the royal couple, are both thrown out of their palatial home--Orestes is exiled, and Electra forced to marry a commoner and live in a hovel.
The term ""Electra Complex"" refers to a daughter's unnatural love for her father and while this is not overtly portrayed here, the hints are certainly in place.  Even when her mother tells Electra of the king's infidelities the daughter defends him, citing the queen's own as proof of the latter's treachery.
Electra and Orestes take revenge on the couple who have killed their father--not without great remorse.
Cacoyannis' skill is demonstrated in his choice to film this work in black and white, accentuating the starkness of the tale, which contains numerous stretches of silence, an effective Greek chorus of village women (all clothed similarly in black), and an equally effective score by the great Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis who also composed the music for Zorba the Greek.  The story is pure drama--the emotional elements are laid bare in the stripped to the bone dialogue that wastes no words.
The cinematography as well emphasizes the basic elements of earth and sky; black and white has seldom been used as well in a drama as it is here.  Earth is the land of man where we live and die; sky is the land of the gods to whom we appeal for everything we want that we don't have. And whether or not we get what we want--who can say?
Highly recommended.",1063670400,58,1988,4.937125748502994
1665438,5,B00005UJY8,"Greek director Michael Cacoyannis brings Euripedes' classic tragedy to the screen with great liberties. Taking off from the murder of Agamemnon, this version of the tragedy sticks to the basic story of Elektra marrying and the ensuing double murder. Yet, Cacoyannis has stripped away much of the original dialogue in favor of stark cinematography and silent stretches. Irene Papas is outstanding as the doomed heroine. Pure Cinematography...excellent film",1031443200,15,455,5.705882352941177
7954598,5,B00005UJY8,"I came to view this film the long way around. I have watched the Richard Straus Opera ""Elektra"" in which there are people of the same name but different spelling than the film. In the play Elektra the eldest daughter is upset because her mother Klytmnestra and her mother's lover Aegisth killed her father the king, Agamemnon. She calls on her father's spirit, and vows vengeance. Her younger sister Chrysothemis tries to talk her out of it. Her mother comes to here drugged and sleepless asking Elektra what can be done to make amends so her nightmares will end. Elektra tells her that the blood of an impure woman must be shed. Later Elektra is told that her brother, Orest is dead so she tells her sister that she must help kill the mother and lover. Orest turns up alive and is coaxed into killing first Klytmnestra and then Aegisth. So much emotional hate and joy is released that Elektra dances until she falls dead.

Then there are several translations of the play by Sophocles 410 BC.

Now we come to the interpretation for this 1962 film play directed by Michael Cacoyannis of ""Zorba the Greek"" fame. The film takes 113 minutes; Approximately 15 minutes of dialog, 30 minutes of mime to cut out the bulk of the dialog from the play, and the rest filler of people milling around. I do not mean to sound trite but be prepared for long moments where we have to listen to an off key string instrument or a bunch of horns that keep us focused of where the action should be. There is a moving song and a chorus that speaks out now and them. The set is the Greek landscape with a few structures. It is shot in black and white. This is saved by exceptional acting.

There is a touching scene where Agamemmnon retunes to great his wife and children. Then we watch as Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus net in Agamemmnon for the kill. Orestes gets led out to a foreign land and Electra is under house arrest until she grows up. She cuts off her hair in protest and is married off to an innocuous peasant. Will she ever get revenge? And is Orestes even alive? What ho, strangers approach.

This is a tale of ""...A family so noble and so damned at the same time.""

To get a different take on the story you can read ""Care of the Soul: A Guide for Cultivating Depth and Sacredness in Everyday Life"" by Thomas Moore, where he tells the story a little different in depicting the role of becoming a mother.

The media itself is a DVD with options of Greek: Mono, English: Mono or French: mono. Then the option also of English, French and Spanish Language Subtitles. The singing is done in Greek only but you can use English subtitles to tell what they are singing. There are no pamphlets with this package.",1503878400,,2700,4.444444444444445
7954599,5,B00005UJY8,"Excellent, outstanding.  This is no sort of comedy, but a thoroughly evocative film, especially when you know the background story.  We now know that the Trojan War actually happened, and It is of course the very stuff of legend but there must be core fact also.  In those days no distinction was made between historical truth and legend, because it was all story-telling, and this is wonderful story-telling.  There is detailed realism in the telling, which will help draw you into it.  I've seen Irene Papas do very good film work, in ""The Guns of Navarone"" for example.  I've never been her biggest fan, but she is excellent here, as is the supporting cast.  Well done!",1491609600,,672,4.741379310344827
