6879104,5,B00QT4VDC0,"Surprise, Surprise, Surprise! Paramount does it again!

Gomer Pyle USMC has been previously available as a ""complete series"" set which was nothing more than the five individual sets shrink-wrapped together. No outer slip cover, no new content, nothing. There was no reason to buy it unless you did not already own the individual sets.

Well, Paramount does it again! sorta.

This time around Paramount released the series in new packaging which is a cardboard slipcover over a big clear keepcase with hinged trays inside for the discs. It is good to see Paramount isn't using one big spindle for the dvds like Sony has been doing. Sadly that is all that is new. This set is obviously aimed at those who have not purchased the season sets previously. For $40 this is a great deal but...

Shame, Shame, Shame on you Paramount!

The bad news is inside this nice new packaging are the same old 24 dvds. No new content at all. The dvds look and sound great so this wouldn't be that big of a deal if Paramount didn't screw up and screw over the fans the first time around. Paramount cut numerous scenes in several of the season 2-4 episodes. The cuts scenes are mainly ones where Nabors is performing musical numbers that Paramount didn't want to pay for the rights to use. For the most part, the cuts are not that obvious. If you haven't seen the show before, you probably wouldn't notice something is missing. Still, tampering with a classic show like this is just wrong. You would think that Paramount would have tried to redeem itself and fix the issues this time around. C'mon everybody, one more time as a group...

Shame, Shame, Shame on you Paramount!

I was tempted to give this release one star but that wouldn't be fair to this classic show. IMHO, Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton are one of the funniest comic duos of all-time and this set is definitely worth buying (IF you don't already own the previous sets) even with the cut scenes. If Paramount couldn't restore the scenes the second time around, it is fairly obvious they never will.

One More Time!

Shame, Shame, Shame on you Paramount!

For the benefit of those who do not already own the individual seasons and/or may be new to the show, here is a breakout of the 24 dvd set. It includes all 5 seasons and all 150 episodes of Gomer Pyle UMSC.

Audio: The only audio track on this set is a Dolby Digital English Mono Mix. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: There are no subtitles on the set but it is close-captioned in English only.

Extras: The extras on this set are from Season One
*Audio Introductions by Jim Nabors to all of the Season One Episodes.
* An Audio Commentary by Jim Nabors on Gomer Overcomes the Obstacle Course
* An Audio Commentary by Ronnie Schell on Gomer and the Dragon Lady
* The Pilot Episode: Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. from The Andy Griffith Show with an Optional Audio Commentary by Jim Nabors

The only problem is that the case that this collection  comes in is not strong enough.  The first one that arrived came in a bubble-wrap folder and the case was cracked in several places.  Amazon excellently came and got the damaged collection (the discs were ok, just the case damaged) and took my suggestion of sending the replacement in a box for protection.  Well, guess what?  The case on the second one was damaged as well, although the box it came in looked fine.  So, I have to guess that the case was damaged before it got into the box.  This whole process of took less than 2 weeks, but it was necessary. I decided to just forget reporting the second damage and just live with it.
 Please use a stronger plastic case.  Other than that, the product is very enjoyable.",1509494400,2,794,4.458333333333333

If you liked this zany comedy when the trailer first aired in the later season of the Andy Griffith show (Season 4), you'll love how the first episode of this series ties in nicely to build a great/hilarious foundation for the great five year sitcom.

The quality of the discs are top-notch, very clear with no  drop outs or audio distortions. The packaging is really great in my opinion - allows for easy access to each disc and provides nice protection.  Due to the size, the slip cover is a little lose; however, not a real problem.

I do wish they would have left in Jim Nabors singing - he is such an awesome singer.

I strongly recommend this to those who enjoy the true 30 minute sitcom from this era - it will most certainly take you back to those days of less violent TV - a time of innocents so to speak.",1472947200,10,693,4.141791044776119

6879252,5,B00QT4VDC0,"I have great memories of growing up watching reruns of ""Gomer Pyle"" with my father.  As a child of the 80s who grew up in the 90s, I can still say that this show cracks me up to this day.

I have a couple of minor complaints:
Some of the episodes cut out some musical numbers.  This isn't an issue when the music plays a much larger role in the episodes (e.g.  ""The Show Must Go On"" and the other episodes where Gomer goes to DC for the Navy Relief Show) or ""Sing a Song of Papa"" where Gomer sings a song that makes a club owner sentimental, but it comes into play where the music is more incidental, such as a distinct song missing from the episode ""Two on the Bench.""
Also, the packaging is thick and not well contained; the big spindle of discs easily comes out of the packaging.

Other than that, there's little to complain about.  A great series to own on DVD.",1452988800,3,865,4.149700598802395
6879253,5,B00QT4VDC0,"Can anyone help me out?  I disticntly remember an episode where Gomer takes a girl out on a date and he takes her up to a Lover's Lane inspiration point and parks.  The girl immediately thinks Gomer is there to make out with her.  But she soon finds out the
only reason Gomer brought her there was just to relax, lean back, roll the windows down, breathe the night air and just talk and enjoy the quiet.  He also wanted her to hear a train that came by each night off in the distance.  Gomer then sang a song to her.  I believe the song was called,  "" A Hundred Miles.""  The words went,... "" A  hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles....You can hear the whistle blowing a 100 miles.""

The girl was pleasantly surprised and pleased to find that Gomer hadn't taken her up there to make out, but just to relax and talk.  The episode I thought it was on  (where Sgt Hacker sets Gomer up with a Burlesque dancer was not the one.)  I'm trying to find what episode and Season this was on.  Anyone who can help....please let me know.  Thanks!",1452902400,2,1060,4.23
6879254,5,B00QT4VDC0,$30 ?? This gives you 5 seasons at $6 a season! I paid over $20 a season and I still thought it was worth it. Don't pass up this one. Watch an episode or two from your library to decide if you like it. But this is quite a bargain.,1449705600,4,230,3.62
6879255,5,B00QT4VDC0,"Purchased as a Christmas gift, knowing some of the copyrighted materials are cut from the original broadcast.  The packaging and disc all appear to be perfect.  Will follow-up with a revision as needed.  Saw many complaints about some of the Jim Neighbors music being cut.  I understand the entertainment industry, and considering the vintage of the show, and recent marketing efforts of his portfolio, missing a few songs isn't a deal breaker.  I don't buy TV shows for the music, that's why they sell albums...",1449360000,,512,4.976470588235294

I loved watching this show in rerun on my local station back in the 1980's and I love the whole some of the show. My only two thoughts on this packaging was that it came in a bulky package with all of the season and not in the each season box, but so what ... I still own the show & if I really wanted to all I would say is I would buy a Dvd/cd holder to hold the discs in, if I didn't want to keep the packaging the way it came",1442275200,,517,3.584070796460177

I had all of them on VHS and thought they were okay in quality to copy them to  DVD's.  This collection was the way to go. Great picture quality and sound was very good. Love watching them with my small kids. Great comedy, loads of laughs, brings back the memories. Frank Sutton RIP, Jim Nabors, thanks for the laughs. They just don't make them like these shows anymore. So worth the collections of these DVDs vs. copying all my old VHS tapes recorded off of the TV. These were shows recorded back in the days where you could get a load of laughs without bringing in a sexist twist to the scene. Perfect for watching with small kids and laughing out load. Those of us who know about these shows understand. For those under 30, you might think they are so dated and corny, but you missed a great time. Jim, thanks again for the laughs !

6879309,5,B00QT4VDC0,"Wow, this has to be the biggest clamshell case I've ever seen for a set of DVDs. But it seems to work. Each disc is separate from the others - there are 12 hard plastic 'pages' with a single disc on each side. You would think it would be difficult to get a disc out - but the whole disc library lifts out of the outer case and you can easily get to the disc that you want. The outer case is transparent plastic and the case cover has the disc index printed on the back of the cover art.

I mainly bought this set for nostalgia reasons, I was a kid when this show was originally on the air. And I remember watching it again later when it was in syndication. But I really don't remember much about the earlier seasons.

The first thing I did was to watch the pilot episode from the Andy Griffith show where Gomer first enlists in the Marine Corps and Andy takes him to the base - worried that Gomer might not fit in, he hangs around in case Gomer needs a ride back home. While watching this episode I'm remembering the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Time-for-Sergeants/dp/B003KM4BC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Time for Sergeants</a>&nbsp;where Andy Griffith played a character similar to the one Jim Nabors is playing and in a similar situation. I wonder if that role/movie was the basis for this series.

All-in-all I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to many nights of rewatching this classic old series.",1429833600,35,1468,4.794466403162056
