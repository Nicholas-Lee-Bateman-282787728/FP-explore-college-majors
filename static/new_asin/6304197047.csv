804746,4,6304197047,"An old series which brought back some wonderful memories.  It was wonderful to watch and listen to the voices again.  George Burns and Gracie Allen were excellent together and their brand of comedy; clean, sweet and so honest and innocent on the part of Gracie it just seemed REAL, then and now.  Thanks for having it to purchase.  I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it the ""older"" generation, like me.",1260403200,9,404,4.728571428571429
804747,3,6304197047,"With so many collections of the Burns and Allen show on offer, it's difficult to avoid duplication. Here are the episodes on the two discs,  as listed on the box (the selection of episodes is good):

DISC ONE
The Property Tax Assessor
The Income Tax Man
Teenage Girl Spends the Weekend
Space Patrol Kids Visit
Free Trip to Hawaii
Gracie's Checking Account

DISC TWO
Harry Morton's Private Secretary
The Beverly Hills Uplift Society
The Kleebob Card Game
Divorce Attorney
Surprise Birthday Party

The visual quality of the shows are all right, but the sound quality leaves much to be desired. However, if you play the discs through a good sound system, adjusting the bass and treble controls will clear it up a bit.",1244678400,32,714,4.780487804878049
804748,5,6304197047,"Burns and Allen is a hilarious show that was produced in the early 1950's. The show is mainly about a man who's wife is crazy. (She's not really crazy it's just some of the stuff she says is.) Someone can say somthing and she will come back with some of the funniest stuff to say. Example In the gracie throws a wedding episod, a women is talking to gracie and tells her she is getting ready to marry a used car salesmen, gracie tells her, well I guess it doesn't matter if he's new or used as long as you love him. You have to understand that yes these shows are old, and there are editing flaws, THEY WERE MADE IN THE 1950'S!!! they didn't have the technology that we have now. My dad and i watch these all the time, and roll laughing. I am 18 years old and love the show, Please don't let some of the bad reviews people have wrote let you miss out on this show.",1153699200,4,864,4.058479532163743
804749,5,6304197047,"One of televisions most beloved husband and wife teams starred in this variety show as a straight man husband and ditzy wife. This DVD features three classic episodes of the show that aired on CBS from October 12, 1950 to September 22, 1958

804750,2,6304197047,"From contented cows. You might be wondering why I titled my review this way. Obviously from the shows on this dvd, carnation evaporated milk....from contented cows, was the sponsor. During the skits the ""gags"" would stop in mid-stream while one of the actors mentioned the product. In a few episodes they even went as far to demonstrate it's quality. I didn't feel like I was watching a 'Burns and Allen' show, It felt like a long boring commercial for carnation milk. The quality of the picture is ok..just ok. There are parts in a couple of episodes where scenes were snipped together, almost like the films we watched in high school. Remember how those films would break and someone would repair them only to have scenes jumping from one minute to the next. If you are a die hard fan of 'Burns and Allen' I would recommended this dvd if only for the low cost. If you just like 'Burns and Allen' I would recommend that you pass this one by.",1096243200,6,942,4.514619883040936
804751,5,6304197047,"Gracie Allen is ditzy without being vacant, and George is her straight man without belittling her. A concept the world has long forgotten about! They are totally magic.",1060041600,7,168,5.035714285714286
804752,5,6304197047,"One of television's greatest comedy teams, George Burns and Gracie Allen, take center stage in this video showcasing two episodes from their show's first season. Gracie is genius as her ditzy and naive alter-ego. Her oblivious nature makes her not only funny, but extremely likable as well. George Burns plays a great straight man for her zany schemes, as well as delivering witty monologues between scenes.  Bea Benaderet (who would latter portray Cousin Pearl on ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Betty Rubble on ""The Flintstones"") also puts in a great performance as Blanch Morton, Gracie's best friend and neighbor. Each episode of the tape not only showcases the actor's talent, but also the show's great irreverence, with George always breaking the ""fourth wall"" and popping in and out of scenes unnoticed by the characters performing in them. I would defiantly recommend these shows to anyone looking for some real comedy.",1048377600,15,926,5.214765100671141
804753,5,6304197047,"This video will have you rolling in the aisles as Gracie stumps George and  the neighbors with her opinions on everything from plumbers to how to  choose a production company based on how much butter they put on their  popcorn.  And of course, there are the misunderstandings that are classic  Gracie Allen.
This is a two episode video and includes: ""Columbia  Doing Burns and Allen Story"" and ""Gracie Doing a Picture Without  George.""
You'll laugh your bobby socks off at this video.  I highly  recommend it for a lot of good old fashioned laughs.",968371200,4,548,4.74468085106383
