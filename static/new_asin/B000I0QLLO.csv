8142709,5,B000I0QLLO,Just saw this movie on (THIS) an NBC channel that shows old movies an it was great! To bad it's not available on DVD.... Jodie Foster was wonderful in this very intelligent and moving story of a young girl who is dying from heart problems. I would have purchased this in a second... Also have noticed that this movie isn't listed on Jodie's bio or anywhere else I could find.... Not sure why this would have been omitted. Loved this Story and the acting was wonderful by all involved.,1428710400,,484,4.449438202247191
