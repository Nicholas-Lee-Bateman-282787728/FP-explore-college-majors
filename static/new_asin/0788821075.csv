75357,5,0788821075,"It's no wonder this film became a hit.  You look at Julia Roberts and it's hard not to like her.  You look at her (especially for me, when she's with Richard Gere and she's playing with him about rescuing her if she fell off the balcony of his penthouse apartment) and think, ""This girl is going to save this man! This is the girl for him!"" I thought that way about Laura San Giacomo (she played Kit De Luca, Julia's hooker friend) as well.  I looked at her youth and her beauty and saw no ""trash"" in her.  Sometimes, I thought she should've won the role instead of Julia.  No offense, Ms. Roberts.  I'll say one thing about Richard Gere's character: He's not only likable, but he's strong.  He's strong enough to resist temptation.  I wish I were more like him.",1516665600,2,762,4.3546099290780145

would strongly recommend watching it",1514246400,,84,5.538461538461538
75393,3,0788821075,I remember when this came out it really made Julia Roberts a mega star.  When I saw it.  I really didn't think it was all that great.  It was okay.  And I thought that Richard Gere was very good in it.  Just like An Officer And A Gentleman.  It seemed like he brought out the best in the lead actress and he himself got very little credit.  I don't think critics give him enough credit and don't realize how good of an actor he is.,1514246400,,431,4.0

75398,1,0788821075,"Good thing they edited the original movie or it wouldnt of done nearly as well. If you like the original do yourself a favor and avoid this  15th anniversary edition, the dialogue is disgusting and cheezie! Besides the horseback riding scene every scene added ruins the original movie. There are many appalling crude surprises. This will be a donation for a triple x store.

Ya, men like my husband are reason way women are so relatable with Vivian & her dream of a Knight coming to her rescue.
Even though I've seen this movie too many times to count, it had me hooked as if it were the first time & I needed to see the end so I paid the $2.99 to watch it on my Android...worth it! This movie still leaves me with the feeling of wanting to be someone's Pretty Woman.

75862,1,0788821075,"In this movie, cheap corner hookers are presented as naive, romantic, clean, ""pretty"" girls who use colorful condoms and floss their white teeth and giggle in bubblebaths.  They don't steal from you, they don't do drugs or get drunk, they don't curse, they don't have violent and dangerous friends, and they fit in at elegant parties so that no one can tell where they are from.  They charm everyone who meets them, from the high-class hotel staff, to the high-class store workers, to the millionaires and the millionaire wives.

We are supposed to believe that a millionaire businessman would marry a cheap hooker just as if she were a virginal princess in a G-rated fairytale.

This cheap hooker actually thought that a millionaire could not afford to pay her $300.  He left her alone in his hotel room during the day, with all of his things, and she never stole anything or had her ""clients"" come in while he was gone.  She never tried to ""work"" the bar in the hotel lobby.  She didn't try to come up with some schemes to get more money from him.  When his attorney-buddy tried to ""do business"" with her, she actually got insulted, and even more ridiculous, the millionaire actually defended her ""honor"" to his buddy.

The attorney-buddy was absolutely right by what he said, and he certainly did not deserve a broken nose for telling the truth.  The hooker suddenly believes that she wants ""more"" and turns down a deal that any hooker would love to retire into (a nice apartment with money and clothes, just to meet with this guy once in a while when he is in town) - - so, the ""pretty woman"" does not want to be a ""kept woman,"" but instead would rather get some minimum-wage job because she has no skills and no experience and no high school diploma.  However, if she suddenly believes that she can get a real job, then why didn't she do that in the first place instead of becoming a hooker?

We are supposed to believe that these two have fallen in love, in only one week of evenings together (remember, he leaves her alone while he works all day).  What exactly do they love about each other?

This millionaire was not grossed out by the fact that she is a cheap hooker, and he never asked her how long she has been a hooker and how many men she has been with.  She tells him that she ""does everything"" but he has sex with her like it is romantic lovemaking.

The other hooker referred to her as ""Cinderella"" which is ridiculous.  I cannot imagine any prince who would pick up a hooker on a street corner and then propose to her a week later.

There are escorts who are trained to do the job that this man wanted.  If we are supposed to take this movie seriously, then this movie should have used an escort from a high-class agency.

Do you want to see a comedy?  I would love to see a sequel of this movie, where the wedding happens.  The bride invites her only friends, who are hookers (she is estranged from her family), and the groom invites millionaires and clients (he also has no family).  Maybe the hotel manager comes to give the bride away.  The hookers and millionaires mingle at the reception until a huge fight breaks out.  The attorney-buddy, who is the best man, has sex with all of the hookers in the men's room.  The other hooker, who is the maid of honor, arranges meetings with all of the millionaires for while the happy couple are on their honeymoon - - they can meet at the couple's newly-purchased mansion while they are away.  When they come home from their honeymoon, the bride realizes that she is pregnant, but the groom wonders whether the baby is his.

One line from the song is the only thing about this movie that made sense :  ""I don't believe you, you are not the truth.""
However, I am sure that whoever wrote the lyrics to the song did not have a hooker in mind.

Regarding the acting, Richard Gere plays his usual wooden personality, and Julia Roberts does her usual overacting and over-bubbly character.  They both have played those same roles over and over.

This movie is a pathetic piece of garbage.",1488672000,,4045,4.47612551159618

75864,5,0788821075,A classic.  A prostitute who's new to the trade picks up a wealthy guy (a businessman) just to help show him how to get to a Beverly Hills hotel and is asked inside- not for sex but for commeraderie.

76663,5,0788821075,"Although this film was made in 1990, it touches on social issues that are very current in this presidential elections cycle in the US: how poverty leads to crime and thus equals crime; how the quest for human dignity transcends all walks of life; the intrinsic values generated when corporate acquisitions build rather than tear down; the corrupt interaction between corporate America and its government, giving the saying 'absolute power corrupts absolutely' very tangible meaning; and last but not least, how love conquers all. The presentation of these big ticket issues are wrapped in a very human and touching story in this movie, making it, in my opinion, a timeless artistic, socio/political/economic classic. Moreover, the political revolution Bernie Sanders supporters, with his leadership will accomplish is, utilizing 21st century advancements to finally put to rest these persisting civil challenges that began long before 1990.",1469145600,,940,5.534722222222222

However, there is no ""resume play"" feature activated on this disk.  What that means is that every time one stops the movie, it starts over from the beginning.  I find this very frustrating as it is rare that my wife and I can watch an entire movie at one sitting.  It typically takes us four nights so that every time we restart the DVD we it starts over again and we then have to fast forward or go via the section feature to find out place.  This is not necessary with the proper blu ray DVD authoring as the specs allow for resume play.  No matter how much I love a movie, without resume play it is not worth more than three stars.",1459036800,,804,4.209150326797386

Roberts is funny and cheeky and gorgeous, of course, and Gere is convincing at going from being in complete control - or thinking he is - to being less sure of himself. And also gorgeous, of course. I still disliked the emphasis on consumerism (watch Julia shop!) but appreciated the digs at snooty shopkeepers and the fine supporting cast (Hector Elizondo as the hotel manager and Laura san Giacomo as Roberts's friend Kit. The ending is a classic.",1457222400,4,532,4.670212765957447

77195,5,0788821075,"When one thinks of Julia Roberts, two movies usually come to mind for me. PRETTY WOMAN and SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, which followed this charming classic. ""Pretty Woman"" was a huge success in 1990, so much so, that is literally catapulted Julia Roberts to well known fame. The year prior saw her doing ""Steel Magnolias"" with a variable cast also.
This release marks the first time the movie has been released on Hi Definition Blu-ray. Fortunately, for all the fans that love this movie, it is the THEATRICAL 120 minute version. YES! It is the same as the VHS that was first released with some nicely added bonus features.
The look of the movie is gorgeous with a beautiful menu.
~ Special Features are:
* Blooper Reel
* ""Live From the Wrap Party""
* ""LA The Pretty Woman Tour""
* 1990 Production Featurette
* ""Wild Women Do"" performed by the ""late"" Natalie Cole (Deceased as of Jan 1, 2016)
* Feature Audio Commentary by Garry Marshall

Don't buy this addition unless you're ready to be pulled out of the story several times. They've added in several deleted scenes that weren't in the original movie I remember seeing on tv all the time. The first time I caught one I actually went back and was like wait what was that and it happened several diff times so I couldn't enjoy the movie at all. If you're going to add in deleted scenes then give the option of the original viewing or ones with those or even just put them in the extras not in my movie.,1445990400,,631,4.056

77303,2,0788821075,"Movie Review:

Pretty Woman is an okay movie. It's not great, but it's not bad. At the end, I was left thinking, ""Well, that happened..."" without any emotional pull toward any direction. Julia Roberts character was decent, and Richard Gere was...Richard Gere. Lifeless and devoid of any emotion. The story was decent (Who doesn't love Cinderella? Except her step-sisters and step-mother...), but everyone talks about the ""You work on commission, don't you?"" line, and there was no follow-up to that scene whatsoever. It seemed utterly pointless. It reminded me of ""No one puts baby in the corner"" from Dirty Dancing - the most random of quotes with no relevance to the rest of the film. Jason Alexander as a sleaze was the highlight of the film. I love to see him play odd roles.

Blu-ray Review:

Basic disc features: commentary, The Making of..., typical stuff. If you love the movie, get it. If not, wait for it to pop up on Netflix.",1442448000,,936,4.765432098765432

77327,5,0788821075,"What a movie! I wish I'd seen it when it originally came out because I'm just old enough to remember this fine film. Yet not until now did I get the opportunity to see it and even then it's because a girl I know gave me the DVD when she moved out of her apartment.

The version I saw was the 10th anniversary edition DVD and while it may well be different from what was once shown on the big screen, I can honestly tell you that it made no difference to me. I loved this movie! I could not get enough of Richard Gere or Julia Roberts, who truly had a remarkable chemistry together. Hector Elizondo, who also worked with Gere in American Gigolo, was himself fantastic as the hotel manager who obsesses over every little thing. All of the minor characters add realistic flavor to the movie from the bellhops to the roommate of Julia Roberts.

While this movie was poorly edited and unfortunately used voluptuous body doubles a bit too much for the skinny Julia Roberts, it has a place in movie history. The title and usage of the theme from the late great Roy Orbison only adds to the greatness of this film. It very well may be the best romantic comedy that I've ever seen. The extra scenes people gripe about I can't speak for since I have no basis for comparison; all I can say is that they seemed to be done well and did not take away from the narrative and pacing of the film.

I won't go into detail on the plot. Many others have done that better than I have. I highly recommend this movie and I'm glad to be the 1118th person to review this Five Star film. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.

How are you doing today, gal?  How much do I owe you for this film? I watch it every day. You create a positive impact in my life through your career.  I've been fascinating by your achievements as your ""Big"" Fan.  Words are not enough for me, to explain my sincere compliments and congratulations to you, for what you've done toward me.  What I owe you is: gratitude, recognition, and respect.

You earned 60,000 bonus points to heaven, the fact that I watch it  daily.  You made my day!.  God likes to see that: when you make me smile and laugh.  The credit goes also to your co- Actor ""Edward"" (Richard Gere).

Dear Oscar Members of Directors,

If you already gave Julia Roberts  and Richard Gere an Oscar for that film, Im writing to request a second or a Golden Globe award for both and casting staff.  They deserve it.  Consider it like a delayed reward. That happens in life.  It is the good gesture that counts.

She was a noble person who taught us not to be discouraged regardless how tough our afflictions of life are.  She was precise with her motivation/passion/determination, in which that things can change for a better tomorrow.  What you saw in this motion picture was: perseverance, courageous approach for a positive outcome.

Silver Screen Partners IV, Arnon Milchan, Gary Marshall, Gary W. Goldstein, Laura Ziskin, Steven Reuther, J.F. Lawton, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Way to go; guys!  Thank you very much.",1430870400,,1446,4.7269076305220885

Not only does it have the rags to riches fantasy, it's full of witty lines and rather nicely done moments. It's still based on the rather implausible delusion about what prostitution is and how people end up being prostitutes, and it's still the man that saves the woman, the night in shiny armor rescues the damsel in distress.

77958,5,0788821075,"Richard Gere plays the roll of the super-rich & powerful corporate executive as he earns millions, and drives his car one evening through a neighborhood not in his class, as he runs into Julia Roberts, a prostitute on the opposite side of town. They ride around for a while, and a one-night affair turns into a one week business deal, but that's not where it ends in this hilarious rags-to-riches comedy.

The more they get together, the closer they become, until they fall in love. She's the one woman, who can give him a lifetime of happiness, and their dreams come true at the end. There are laugh-out-loud scenes, passionate scenes, and heartwarming scenes. Acting Performance of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are Superb. This movie is an enjoyable romantic comedy, with a happy ending as it entertains from start to finish. Highly recommended!",1410220800,3,849,4.895833333333333

This Cinderella-like story catapulted Julia Roberts into becoming a Hollywood icon. Her performance made it a memorable film that it still is after more than twenty years since it was released in the theaters despite the fact that it will always be modern fairy tale story-wise. Aside from Roberts and the entertainment it provided the viewer,the film also had a lot of hit songs that it had a memorable soundtrack.",1409097600,,648,5.0092592592592595

For better or worse, this movie is a culture carrier.  It is cheesy and sappy and has some questionable themes.  But, the characters grow, change, and/or show themselves for who they really are.  To finish it off (spoiler alert) it has a happy ending.

The story involved the redemption of a prostitute which might turn some people off. But that aspect was handled quite deftly (for the most part) and shouldn't keep most people from liking the movie. This was the first pairing of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts and IMHO the best. There is a little bit of Cinderella in this movie which I didn't realize until later.

The plot was interesting and the acting was quite good. I especially liked Jason Alexander and Hector Elizondo - both of who was excellent. And  legendary Ralph Bellamy had a nice, very well done, small part.

I would rate this a very high 9.5 out of 10. It has become one of my favorite movies!

78254,5,0788821075,"This movie has been around for a very long time and yet is referred to in movies as an example of what can happen if you believe in love.
I watched a move called ""Friends with Benefits"" and it was mentioned in the movie as the impossible becoming possible.
I love it because it was a lesson in something rare and beautiful and, being a romantic myself, it is nice to believe ..in anything can happen when you least expect it,  even when the odds are so seemingly impossible, it happens anyway.
Also a great lesson for women to want what they want and not compromise their dreams and settle for someone else and lose sight of the ""big dream.""
This film took everyone by surprise, a prostitute and a ruthless business man and they were both screwing people for money, so they had more in common than anyone thought in the first part of the film.
I think that this movie is a ""classic"" and will be around for a very long time.",1377734400,,923,4.304597701149425

Richard Gere's performance was stiff, good looks will not pull you through a movie. There was no presence to him besides the suits and smiles. Julia Roberts was okay and looked beautiful in anything she wore but she could of used a better co-star. I'm a sucker for romance and this was a complete waste of time and money! Thank god I didn't buy this on dvd! For the romantics out there, I recommend ""The Blue Lagoon"". Breathtaking movie with every element you can ask for. I was in tears with the movie. It was played to perfection and is highly recommended!!! But if you feel as though you need to watch this for an American classic film, watch it and get it out of your system.

When this movie was released in theaters, it had talented actors, a great writer, a wonderful director and brilliant editors.  This edition trashes the work of those editors by adding in superfluous scenes.  Those scenes were taken out for a reason - they served NO purpose to the story and they dragged the pace down.

78557,5,0788821075,"The film ""pretty woman"" is a modern classic. It became a huge box office hit in the early 90s and made a superstar out of Julia Roberts. The film's release on DVD has been a muddled affair as a special edition version of the film that added all sorts of deleted scenes was the only version available. These scenes in my opinion took away from the original film which was perfect in it's original form. Sadly, the original theatrical version had been unavailable unless you owned a VHS copy.

The Blu-Ray version here thankfully IS THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSION. The picture quality is clear and you can enjoy Pretty Woman without having to suffer through those awful scenes that the director frankly didn't feel worked either. The blu ray menu is gorgeous with a multipanel layout showing Vivienne's scene from the movie and the corresponding preliminary costume design artwork in another panel. James Newton Howard's amazing (and sadly still unreleased) orchestral scores plays in the background. There are loads of extras that have been offered on previous edition. On this version the main draw is the original film.

I'm very happy to have this version back in my collection.",1331337600,73,1181,4.9296482412060305

This is a really good movie. The casting is great, the writing is good, and Marshall's delivery of an actually rather taboo subject (prostitution)is spot on.
What really gets me though is Gere and Roberts' chemistry. It is awesome. The scene where she first kisses him on the mouth is one of the hottest scenes in cinema history. They've since reteamed (Runaway Bride) which is another movie I truely love, but it doesn't catch Julia in the same way as this movie did when she was still green and young. Marshall caught a moment in time with two charismatic people that won't likely be replicated for a long while.
Feed into the hype. This is a great romance. I just would not let young kids watch it, since there is prostitution and drug use. I will actually probably add this to my movie collection next time I buy a few movies.",1328140800,,993,4.4021739130434785

It's the only negative review I've posted, and it's not something in which I'd have the slightest interest, and I don't care for Julia Roberts.  I was 'roped' into watching this film on cable with a friend several years ago.  Within several minutes, I could accurately guess the shallow plot which could be summed up as: ignoramous/tramp with a phoney Jersey(?) accent moves to Hollywood and meets pimp (Richard Gere.)  Big surprise--they hit it off.  Big surprise--he has feelings for her but she doesn't.  Big surprise--she changes her mind and wants him.  Big surprise--she changes her mind again and doesn't want him.  Huge surprise--she changes her mind again and off they go into the proverbial sunset.  Hopefully, Gere sent her to school to learn to read and write, at least, though that's irrelevant in her ""profession.""

I had to get away from this thing more and more as it went on, by taking an unprecedented amount of smoke breaks outside (and just sitting outside for awhile, for that matter.)  By the time of one of the sex scenes--I think on top of a piano--he removes her little slip the size of a handkerchief.  That was it.  I stayed outside until it was over.

But I did learn one thing.  The next time someone ropes me into something I dread, I'm gonna say ""Gee whiz, guess what?  I just saw it on TV or VHS or DVD last week.""  That will get me off the hook and out of this kind of situation again.  I guess I could have been blunt and told my friend a minute into the film that I couldn't withstand it.

I'm not trying to be mean, but this kind of junk just doesn't do a thing for me--give me some quality films from the 50s & 60s (see my relatively few reviews.)  Hope no one takes offense.",1304121600,5,1784,4.430769230769231

Julia and Richard just make it look really good.  Julia's performance is the only good one in this flick, seconded by Jason Alexander.  You see Julia's character change and her simpler nature come through. And there's the music.

Roberts received a Golden Globe and Oscar nomination for her role as the call-girl and quickly went into the running as one of Tinsletown's formost up and coming actresses.

78677,5,0788821075,"Pretty Woman is one of my favorite movies. The fact that the wealthy character Edward Lewis uses a ""car phone"" instead of a Blackberry does not make this film any less relevant to a 21st century audience. A timeless classic, it is just as poignant now as it was almost 20 years ago when it first came out.

This is the film that made Julia Roberts' career. Before Pretty Woman, she was virtually unknown as an actress. Roberts was nominated for an Oscar (which I personally think she should have won) for playing the versatile ever-evolving character of Vivian Ward. The fact that Vivian starts out as a prostitute in this movie apparently throws off some reviewers who allow that one fact to prevent them from appreciating the story's innate value. The moral of Pretty Woman is: don't judge a book (or a person) by its cover.

Yes, this movie is Cinderella-ish, but that is part of its charm. Richard Gere plays the rich handsome ""prince"" and Julia Roberts is the street girl who wants to be rescued. I'm sure feminists would criticize Pretty Woman to no end, but WHO CARES?!?! There is a reason movies like this remain so popular. If there was an Oscar for ""On Screen Chemistry,"" Gere and Roberts would have won it. The sex scenes are incredibly romantic and very tastefully done- no excess nudity.

The quality of the 15th anniversary DVD is very good. The Director's commentary is amusing. You will learn some interesting tid bits about the making of the film; however, I wish there was commentary from Roberts and Gere. The primary value of purchasing this DVD is that there are some extended scenes that don't appear in earlier versions, but many of the ""deleted scenes"" mentioned in the commentary are not included which was disappointing.",1240531200,,1746,4.7368421052631575

I do NOT speak from experience but from number of real-life cop-friends I can tell you this: you average hooker looks the OPPOSITE of Julia Roberts (or Melanie Griffth or Elizabeth Shue and all the rest of the hooker-hotties Hollywood throws at us.)

However, it is still a fun movie which has entertained most people who have watched it for over 20 years. Roberts and Richard Gere certainly make a handsome couple (and still do). Hector Elizondo almost steals the show with his minor role as ""Barney,"" the hotel manager. He is definitely the most humorous character in the film.

It's a funny, charming and romantic film that was a big hit. Just don't believe it when Hollywood continues to glamorize the seedy aspects of prostitution.",1239753600,,870,4.993103448275862

The Blu-Ray was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35K. Although the Blu-Ray does not provide a drastic upgrade, the colors and clarity in this BD version, are still noticable. I decided to rent it first, as I was afraid that the upgrade would be disappointing. I'd say it's worth a $15 purchase, for sure. There is some noticable grain throught the film, while the colors pop and outdoor scenes are quite beautiful.

Still one of my favorites, and it always will be. Congratulations to Disney for bringing this older title to BD!",1235260800,4,827,4.574324324324325
78681,5,0788821075,"My companion has adored this movie since its theatrical release, and she owned at various times a couple of previous editions.  She never seems to tire of it, and knows every scene and cites the pivotal dialogue as it's coming up.  That's love, folks, so I bought this Blu-ray edition for her birthday.  Knowing the movie as she does, a klaxon went off when brief scenes were omitted.  I was at first disappointed -- and a little angry -- when she told me that it was cut short by about five minutes from the 15th Anniversary edition.  However, thanks to Mr. Amith's very informative review below (if I could have voted ""yes"" for him multiple times, I would have), that's all cleared up, that this Blu-ray edition is the THEATRICAL release.  It hasn't been cut so much as RESTORED to its original length.  Why the studio simply didn't include both versions on the disc, as has been done with other titles, is an obvious question, but not one that needs to be answered to enjoy this.

For the picture quality itself, the Blu-ray improvement is only slight, as it's not the type of movie that has a real advantage in hi-def.  It's a charming story with a sleek visual style, so it merely looks sleeker, but not necessarily more revealing.  Still, if you love this movie, you should treat yourself to the best transfer available, and, of course, this is it.  As noted, all of the bonus features from the 15th Anniversary Edition have been brought over.  If the DC is your favorite version, you'll have to wait a while.  Because this is a much beloved movie, more than likely, there will be a 20th Anniversary edition -- next year -- with probably both cuts on it.

78685,4,0788821075,"The delightful and charming romantic comedy ""PRETTY WOMAN"" which would win hearts courtesy of the wonderful performances by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts and its fantastic music now makes its Blu-ray debut nearly 20 years after the film's debut.

When I first watched this film, I absolutely fell in love with it.  I purchased it on VHS, the CD soundtrack, the director's cut LaserDisc, the 10th Anniversary and then the 15th Anniversary DVD special edition, multiple release which I didn't mind.  The film has become so much of a favorite that I have traveled to Beverly Hills to check out the Beverly Wilshire, to looking for similar suits and ties around that time period that Edward Lewis would sport, discovering the opera ""La Traviata"" and eventually listening to opera music.  Needless to say, this film at the time, really touched my life and it's hard to believe that nearly 20 years have passed by.

There are so many memorable moments in the film that are just classic, it's a film that has become a classic.  Just to let everyone know, this version is the theatrical version and does not include the director's cut with the extra five minutes of footage.  But how does the Blu-ray edition fare?  Read on.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is presented in 1080p high definition (1:85:1).  The picture quality is not eye-popping beautiful if compared to a film created in the past few years but for a film nearly 20 years old, it looks pretty good on Blu-ray.  There are a variety of scenes that I really looked closely, one being Vivian's first trip to Rodeo Drive and seeing how the outdoor shots would be, the second would be at the polo match and another would be during the restaurant scene.  The picture quality was very good but it had a bit of grain, which is no surprise since grain is part of film.  But again, it wasn't vibrant compared to a recent film but for a film of its time, it looks very good on Blu-ray.

In fact, the film on Blu-ray is the definitive version to own ala picture quality.

As for the audio, the audio is presented in English 5.1 uncompressed (48khz/24-bit) and having a lossless English 5.1 48khz, 24-bit track is pretty damn good.  If anything dialogue is clear, music is very clear and it's what I expected from a dialogue-based film.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The special features included on this Blu-ray are special features that people have seen on DVD.  Included are:

  * Blooper Reel - A blooper reel that is quite dated ala picture quality-wise but otherwise fun to watch.
  * ""Live from the Wrap Party"" - Richard Gere, Garry Marshall and band along with Julia Roberts jamming.  Richard Gere was great on the piano and Marshall, playing the drums and Roberts singing.  A fun featurette but was probably taken via a personal video camera because it looks dated.
  * LA: The Pretty Woman Tour - This section allows people to select on a map, various locations featured in ""Pretty Woman"".  For example, click ""Beverly Hills Wilshire"" and video plays with Garry Marshall giving you his memories of the location and information about it.
  * 1990 Production Featurette - A featurette on the making of the film, interviews and more!
  * ""Wild Women Do"" music video performed by Natalie Cole - I was really hoping that we would see other music video hits included such as Go West's ""King of Wishful Thinking"", Roxette's ""It's Over Now"" and more but only a single video which was on the original DVD release.
  * Theatrical Trailer
  * Feature Audio Commentary with Director Gary Marshall - This is the same commentary from the 15th Anniversary Edition which was released back in 2005.  The 10th Anniversary Edition utilized the director's cut from the LD version and I'm often asked which commentary did I enjoy the most.  The 15th Anniversary/Blu-ray commentary has newer commentary and you hear details that Marshall remembers of the film and how everyone has done since the release of the film ""PRETTY WOMAN"".  But commentary-wise, I felt Marshall's director's cut commentary was very good because it was not long after the release of the film, so a lot of details were mentioned in his first commentary.  Granted, for redoing a commentary for a film over 15 years later, was well done.

Now, surprising is that the deleted scenes (which were included on the film for the director's cut on LaserDisc and the special edition DVD's) are not included as a special feature.  So, for those who prefer the extended version of the film, then the 15th Anniversary Edition DVD is the version to own.

I personally love this film and when the LaserDisc version first came out, it was technologically big because it included the director's cut and featured an audio commentary.  With the Blu-ray edition, I wasn't sure if I would be blown away by the picture quality and the audio quality.  The Blu-ray experience of ""PRETTY WOMAN"" was in the most part good but not great.

There are no extra special features that makes this better in content versus the 15th Anniversary DVD but its strength is that it's featured in 1080p High Definition and an uncompressed 5.1 track (48khz and 24-bit).  Picture quality and audio-wise, if you have a television and receiver that can take advantage of the high definition treatment of this film, then it's even much more enjoyable because of the better quality.  But anything more than that and unfortunately, there is nothing new special-feature wise compared to the 15th Anniversary Special Edition DVD.  I would have loved to hear a commentary or a retrospective featurette with Garry Marshall and some of the talent but with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts doing quite well with their careers, not sure if we would ever see that.  Hopefully in the 25th Anniversary release?

Also, there are some who prefer the theatrical version and some who will prefer the extended cut version.  The Blu-ray version of the film is the theatrical version and the deleted scenes (extra five minutes of footage) added for the director's cut on LaserDisc and on the 15th Anniversary Special Edition DVD are not included on this Blu-ray edition.

But overall, this romantic comedy is still enjoyable and charming now as it was then.  Richard Gere and Julia Roberts did a fantastic job, Garry Marshall did a spectacular job as well as with everyone cast in this film from Jason Alexander to Hector Elizondo, everyone did a great job.  It's a fantastic film period and of all the previous versions that have been released, having owned so many previous releases, the Blu-ray edition is the definitive version to own.",1232755200,72,6562,4.793410507569011
78686,5,0788821075,"ok,i'll take it from the top. 1.)as soon as edward pulled up vivian's friend knew that she had the better class and confidence to deal with a high profile client.vivian did not beg
for
 his services nor did she offer...which made her very mysterious to edward therefore he pursuied the hooker not vice versa. 3.) vivian offered edward something so seductive....a playful stress free life,something he had never had because of the seriousness of his work. vivian made edward get in touch with his playful side (exploring prostitution) not being afraid of heights,taking the day off and having a conscience when dealing with his clients....before the talk with vivian edward was cut throat.

this is not a fairytale but real life seduction.this is the way that a woman capitavates a man's heart,by not being pushy,dominating or passive.vivian was innocent,childlike and very sensual....this turned heads where ever she went wheter she was dressed like a hoochie or a socialite.

vivian had morals and dignity about herself which was irrestable to a millionaire who gets everything he wants when he wants.for him to be with vivian he had to pay a price.....a price to have fun and explore his inhabitions that have been bottled up coming from a family of high expectations......this is a must see movie,this is not a cinderalla story,but a game plan for woman who have been using their charms for thousands of years by seducing men to get the love they want.",1229385600,,1455,4.954918032786885
78697,3,0788821075,"One of those movies you watch every time it comes on television because it's so cute, yet one of those movies you're almost ashamed to adore because it has almost no redemptive features; `Pretty Woman' has become an instant classic for almost no reasons at all.  Sure, it's cute, but so aren't a lot more respectable films.

Oh yeah, I forgot; Julia Roberts is amazing here.

So, that answers all questions doesn't it?  Why do we love this movie?  We love it because it gave us Julia, our beloved Julia.  She is charming and warm and heartbreaking and moving and memorable and sincere and we just want to eat her up in every scene.  The problem with `Pretty Woman' is that when you take Roberts' magnetism out of the equation you have a rather empty film that relies on clich&eacute;s to carry it across the finish line.  It works to an extent (in the fact that it is charming in that totally forced kind of way) but it is nothing spectacular.

So Edward, a wealthy businessman, pays Vivian, a streetwalker, a large sum of money to pretend to be his girlfriend over the weekend while he attends some social events.  He falls in love with her and visa-versa but this poses a problem because he starts to question his ethics (business-wise) and his partners are furious and attempt to break apart the pair.

Total clich&eacute;.

The acting is also hit-or-miss.  Like I said, Roberts is luminous.  We all know that (she has the Oscar nomination to prove it), but aside from her there are only a few standouts.  Jason Alexander is a little overdone, but I'm not a fan of his to begin with.  Laura San Giacomo is decent, but underused so she is rather unimportant.  Hector Elizondo is wonderful, and totally chews up his few scenes.  Then there is the rather boring and uninspired Richard Gere.  I have never been blown away by this guy, and here he just kind of sulks there throughout the movie.

Does this guy know how to evoke any emotion?

He just always appears so sullen.  Him and Nicolas Cage; like seriously, why are they acting?  Gere may be even worse that Cage for me.  At least Cage as the perfection that was `Leaving Las Vegas' and `Adaptation' (how he pulled those off is beyond me), and what does Gere have?  Chicago?  I rest my case.

Anyways, this movie is really all about Roberts.  The film is a mess really; plot-wise at least.  It doesn't make a lot of sense and it glorifies a profession that is rather insulting and degrading.  At least `Leaving Las Vegas' had the decency to create a likable character stuck in a gritty world.  `Pretty Woman' is so obsessed with being charming and likable that it insults the audience by expecting us to buy into this Disney World variation of prostitution.

Oh well, the movie is a C- but Roberts is a solid A+.",1224806400,,2767,4.527272727272727

78699,5,0788821075,I have been a fan of this movie from the very first time I viewed it many years ago. I never get tired of this movie because it has so much to offer both male and female viewers. Richard Gere certainly fits the part of business man and reluctant lover while Julia Roberts is bright and bubbly through out and the romantic ending blows me away every time. I consider Prety Woman to be a clasic.,1220659200,,393,4.184210526315789
78700,5,0788821075,"""Pretty Woman"" harks back to various well-trodden themes: the Pygmalion legend, the prostitute with a heart of gold, and the poor soul who teaches the wealthy person the true values in life. Julia Roberts is a hooker who is rescued from life on the streets by the wealthy and ruthless business tycoon Richard Gere, and she rescues him from a life of reckless power and greed by teaching him business ethics and morality. The audience, because of the acting, the L.A. setting, and the clever way the film was produced and directed, willingly suspends disbelief and accepts this adult fairy tale with its very suggestive sexual action and dialogue.
 The film is well done and was very successful partly because of the romantic chemistry or alchemy that comes across in the love affair between Roberts and Gere. The scene in which Roberts is spellbound by ""La Traviata"" proves to Gere that she is a sensitive soul. (In that opera a hooker also falls for a wealthy man.) The way the two meet seems far-fetched. Do wealthy people really talk about and show off their wealth the way he does? And are they so lacking in street smarts?
Just scratch below the surface, and this hooker and tycoon are both nice people. It's a very watchable fairy tale. Great if you don't stop to analyze too much. Even the manager of the luxury hotel has a heart of gold. Just enjoy this Cinderella meets King Midas cotton candy of a movie.",1219881600,,1414,4.656
78701,4,0788821075,"Movie ratings are always very subjective, with one person's gem being another's trash. That said, I enjoyed the movie, despite it being a bit unrealistic. If your goal is just to be entertained you will likely enjoy this movie. If you are out to play movie critic you will find lots of problems. 4 stars",1219017600,,303,4.527272727272727
78702,3,0788821075,"Hollywood took some of the most ludicris ideas and turned them into gold.  While we have departed from the traditional ""feel good"" movie for anyone or anything and have more harsh realities in popular movies, this was one of the last few movies from the 80s / early 90s that made us think anything is possible.  But still, a Hollywood hooker and a cut throat business tycoon?  I guess it could happen.

This was the movie that launched Julia Roberts into superstardom, based on her photogenic appearence and charisma.  Ever since, she has been annoying audiences because she can't seem to launch herself any further than that.  Are we supposed to really believe that the Cinderella story can really be applied to a white collar businessman and a hooker who are holed up in a five star California hotel as the palace?  Richard Gere and Julia Roberts are both so cute and cuddly.  Instead of drug and alcohol abuse they are both clean and sober, cute to look at, and good hearted people at their core rather than the usual sleaze and dysfunction both would be bringing into the situation.

Three stars are for the role of Jason Alexander.  He would rise to his own stardom as the bumbling George Costanza of Seinfeld fame, but to see him play a cut throat white collar businessman who would give a woman a beatdown put him in another light.  Ha ha ha ...",1218672000,,1352,4.568464730290456
78703,5,0788821075,"Fantastic movie!  One I've seen over and over and never tire watching.  Richard Gere is handsome, sweet and caring.  Julia Roberts plays a hardworking, beautiful and selfless woman.  Great cast and wonderful plot.  Definitely a movie that will go down in history as one of the best!  Highly recommended.",1217635200,,303,5.081632653061225
78704,3,0788821075,"I was so excited to be able to watch this movie on DVD as my VHS copy had bit the dust years ago.  I had this movie memorized from start to finish.  It is a 90's version of Cinderalla remade with the best and brightest stars.  From rags to riches, Julia Roberts proves she is more than just a prostitute from Hollywood Boulevard who wins the heart of Richard Gere (a multi-millionare-billionaire-who owns his own prosperous company).  With scene stealers from Julia's roommate Laura San Giacomo and the style of the Beverly Hills Hotel Manager Hector Elizondo you are sure to be taken in by this movie.  However, don't be fooled with the glitz and glamour of this 15th anniversary edition.  It never fails to produce the dark side of Hollywood in this 21st century that we live in where there isn't always a happy ending.  I was thoroughly disappointed by the multiple additional scenes added to this movie that were not part of the original that, in my opinion, continued to try and remind the audience that Julia Roberts was still just a prostitute.  It was a huge disappointment to me and added not value to the movie.",1215993600,,1121,4.597989949748744
78705,1,0788821075,"With all the ""careers"" they could have used for Julia Roberts in this film, why was prostitution the first choice?

She could have been the desk clerk, a cab driver, the cashier in a book store, a chef in the hotel kitchen, a nanny, a manicurist, the president of the damn bank across the street... anything, anything, anything but a hooker! What is romantic about VD, rape, jail time, pimps, etc?

What does this film say about relationships between men and women? I know this is a popular film, and that scares me even more. A big studio put big money into this, and it tells me all I need to know about their attitudes.",1215907200,16,622,4.4

Not sure why they didn't just give the viewers a choice of watching the original or the new version, but they don't.

78725,3,0788821075,"For sheer escapist fun, few movies top this one. It's the age old story of the heart-of-gold hooker/fallen woman who cleans up her act and finds romance with a rich tycoon (in this case, a businessman who buys struggling businesses, and then breaks them up to sell for a profit). Along the way she softens his hard heart and he also improves as a person. Casting an often repeated predictable movie like this is so key; Julia Roberts is perfect for the part, as she makes her character, Vivian, extremely believable (well, as believable as this character can be). She injects her usual bubbly personality with just enough tears to make you root for her the entire way. Richard Gere has never been a favorite actor of mine; at times in this movie, he is spot on, at other times, he simply walks through a performance. However, this still does not detract from the light-hearted enjoyable quality of this film. Roberts is the  one to watch, anyway. Hector Elizondo gives a nice supporting turn as the Concierge who preps Roberts on becoming a lady. Jason Alexander gives a good performance as Gere's scumbag assistant who doesn't like the humane changes Roberts' character is causing Gere to take on. As for viewability, there are a few slightly steamy love scenes between Gere and Roberts and a few other adult situations; not good for little children, but fine for teens and older.

Sadly, for this edition, Garry Marshall felt it necessary not only to include the deleted scenes, he actually inserted them back into the movie that you watch. Most people watching this know that it is fantasy escapist comic fare; adding a few scenes of street life/hookers in an attempt to make it more ""gritty"" or ""real"" only splits apart the atmosphere. If I wanted to watch a movie on LA street life, I'd rent one.

The extras are very sparse; a blooper reel which is mildly amusing; again, Roberts' infectious laugh and humor make this short section fun. The ""LA: Pretty Woman Tour"" would be cool, but each location is given an extremely brief explanation. This is not anything indepth. Still, with a little help from Google, you could easily find these locations after Garry Marshall's somewhat funny commentary on these Los Angeles locales. ""Live from The Wrap Party"" is embarrassing; a very poor video quality excerpt of Roberts, Gere, and Marshall attempting to sing ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood."" The whiskey bottle in Roberts' hand gives an explanation as to the context of this drunken clip. Who the heck decided to add this?

I believe the trailer, ""Wild Women Do"" music video, and ""1990 Production Featurette"" were all on the previous edition. There are no ""looking back"" featurettes, current interviews, etc. that would have really added to the value.

For the movie, I give 5 stars (the picture and sound quality are excellent!); for this not-so-special Special Edition, I give 3 stars.",1197763200,6,2887,4.847870182555781
78726,4,0788821075,"Julia Roberts ,in a star making performance ,plays Vivian Ward an LA hooker who meets millionaire wheeler-dealer Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) and he falls in love with the lady,and gives her an extreme style makeover.
That in its essence is the story of this mega movie that was so popular on its original release .It would have worked equally well ,30 years earlier for ,say Paula Prentiss and Rock Hudson .This time out the sex is raunchier than it would have been in an earlier era ,the language a lot spicier and they would not have had the nudity which appears in Pretty Woman back then .Suprisingly-given the title -there is more male nudity than female -perhaps one reason the picture was popular with the feminist critics .

What makes this movie work as well as it does is the skill and style of all the ingredients in the mix. Roberts is simply adorable while Gere reveals an hitherto unsuspected gift for light romantic comedy .The two stars are backed by a strong suporting cast including Laura San Giacomo as Gere's girlfriend ,Hector Elizondo as the manager of the hotel in which much of the action takes place ,Jason Alexander as Gere's slimy attorney and a shrewd cameo from Patrick Richwood as the night elevator operator ,eyes practically out on stalks as he takes in what is going on before his eyes.
Add to this the hit strewn  soundtrack ,some polished direction from Garry Marshall , a perky script rich in good lines from J Lawson and you have a ""Beverly Hills Cinderella meets Pygmalion "" yarn that is given more plausibility than it perhaps deserves

Julia Roberts became a star after this film, she plays a hooker who falls in love with Edward (Richard Gere). Vivian (Roberts) lacks manners, morals, and luck but things change once Edward opens her mind to different ways of life. This film is a modern-day Cinderella story but with a twist.

78741,5,0788821075,"Pretty Woman begins with corporate raider Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) impulsively picking up a streetwalking prostitute named Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts).  He ends up hiring her for the week as an escort so that he can have a date for certain business dinners that are very important to him.  While she is intelligent, she is also unaccustomed to living the life of luxury and there is a fair amount of humor that flows from her ""fish out of water"" status.  It's a fairly silly setup for the movie and if you want to pick it apart, it's no great challenge to do so.  It does, however, provide a very entertaining backdrop for a Cinderella love story.

This was not the first part in Julia Roberts' career, but it is certainly the one that made her a star.  She is funny, sexy, and has a great warmth and vulnerability that makes it easy to believe that any man could fall in love with her, even a hotshot corporate raider.  Gere does his usual solid acting job.  Hector Elizondo steals the show as the stuffy hotel manager who helps Vivian learn etiquette and softens considerably in the process.  Actually, the cast is very strong from top to bottom with small roles by Jason Alexander and Ralph Bellamy going a long way to making this film worth watching over and over.

Pretty Woman is certainly never going to win any awards for the most intellectually stimulating film of all time, but that's okay.  It's funny when it wants to be and touching when it tries.  And despite the silly story, there are some underlying themes that all of us can relate to and that feel very real.  This one belongs in any DVD library.",1189728000,5,1618,4.518900343642612

78759,4,0788821075,"While visiting Los Angeles for a week, Edward Lewis borrows his friend's car and gets lost on Hollywood Boulevard... He asks a hooker for directions... She proposes to help him for 5 dollars... For $20, she accepted to show him where the stars live...

Edward invites her to join him in his hotel suite, but not for sex...

Enjoying her company, he offers her to be his 'date' for a series of business activities including a strategic dinner and a pool match... Out of the 'bargain,' she gets $3,000 cash, a classier wardrobe and a visit to the opera...

All the characters of the film are convincing, original and sympathetic, feeling comfortable with each other... Director Gary Marshall did a great job...

Ideal for the role is Richard Gere... He plays the terrific rescuer who 'free' Vivian from the streets conducting her to his penthouse suite... He is handsome, charming and shy... 'Henry Higgins' at his best... But Edward Lewis is a millionaire... He buys companies that are in financial difficulty... He takes them apart and sells the pieces for more than he paid for the whole... ""It's strictly business"", he tells Vivian... ""You and I are both such similar people. We both screw people for money."" Edward's only defect is that he hurts what he loves... He wins a certain imaginative power by how painful that treason is...

Julia Roberts plays Vivian Ward, an attractive and smart hooker with a heart of gold... She gives her character a great sense of humor, charming Edward with her honesty... She is intensely appealing and amusing, making any man feel comfortable...

Into the snobbish clothing store, she delivers a great exit line, just devastating the saleswomen... The song is terrific as the scene... In the hotel lobby, she walks in a 'killer' red dress... She learns which fork to use in the formal dinner meeting, projecting an escargot through the air... At the opera she innocently asks: ""Where's the band?""

There's more than a touch of Eliza Dolittle in her role, specially when she decides she wants more from Edward than money... She gets the perfect rescue scene with a limousine, a fire escape, a balcony, birds, music and red flowers...

Hector Elizondo turns a supporting role into more than that... He plays the formal, intolerant hotel manager... He takes an affection to his best customer's ""niece"" and trains her on which fork to use at a fancy dinner... His amusing performance as Edward's smooth competent hotel manager nearly shapes Roberts and Gere...

Ralph Bellamy is incredibly good as the aging millionaire, creator of a small company Edward is trying to take to pieces...

Laura San Giacomo plays Vivian's pal roommate, her first role since she played the amorous sister in ""sex, lies & videotape.""

""Pretty Woman"" is a contemporary Hollywood fairy tale, a sweet romantic comedy, an innocent love story in the middle of self-interest and agreement... It remains as an entertaining motion picture that had women calling out the delights of true love...

If only the 15th Anniversary Special Edition offered the original theatrical version (very happy to see the 5.1), I would give into this marketing trap.

78762,5,0788821075,"There seems to be two schools of thought regarding this movie. There are those who are unable to see past Julia's profession, and all it might entail, and there are those who see how someone who clearly had to make a bad choice one day realized it, and along the way helped someone else realize the bad choices they had made. It's all a charming fairy tale that I have watched over and over again.

Julia Roberts does play a prostitute. However, as the movie unfolds we find out why. Further, we also find that Julia is, as she must be, human, and has the same core values that most of us have. Richard Gere helps her realize during their discussions that she made a poor choice, and eventually Julia realizes that she can be and wants to be more than she is.

During Julia's journey of discovery she also makes Richard Gere question the path in life that he has chosen. Richard buys companies, takes them apart, and sells the pieces for more than he paid for them. While it has made Richard a very wealthy man, Julia questions the value that Richard brings to the world. As Julia realizes that she wants more self-fulfillment in her life, Richard realizes that he wants to be constructive instead of destructive.

Julia's character could have been played in an exploitive way that demeaned her character, and her character's profession. Instead, I thought the subject was handled sensitively and well. Julia several times could have behaved just as Richard would have expected someone in her profession, and yet, she showed that she had pride and values, and she stuck to them, even to her detriment. Ultimately Richard Gere, and the audience, comes to admire Julia Roberts as a strong woman with an incredible will.

In addition to Julia Roberts and Richard Gere is an outstanding supporting cast, including Laura San Giacomo as Julia's friend and roommate, and who gives Julia no end of despair in her choices. Hector Elizondo plays Barney Thompson, the hotel manager.  He makes the role and steals every scene in which he appears. Jason Alexander plays a rather despicable right hand man to Richard Gere; calloused, ruthless and crude. Ralph Bellamy is the head of a business that Richard Gere is attempting to take over, and who gives Richard the best compliment in the entire film, marking a turning point in Richard Gere's attitude about what he does. There is a long list of other actors that made many of the scenes in this movie funny and sometimes poignant. Better you should watch this movie and find out for yourself.

This movie is one of Richard Gere and Julia Robert's best films. We have both the video tape and the DVD, and have watched both multiple times, and will likely watch the DVD many more times. Funny and often touching, this is a wonderful film for adults with a soft spot in their hearts for underdogs and believing that good things happen to good people.",1158105600,9,2885,4.680473372781065

Obviously, if some 14 year old decides she wants to be a hooker when she grows up so she can meet her prince charming, she needs some serious guidance.

Needless to say, the relationship doesn't stay ""just business"" for long.

As events unfold during the film, it becomes clear that, while Edward might not understand too clearly the meaning of ""prostitution"", Vivian clearly does. And, it's another shining film illustration of that pearl of wisdom from Eliza Doolittle (of My Fair Lady) who enlightened us, ""The difference between a flower girl and a lady is not how she behaves, but how she is treated.""

This is not your typical romantic movie and I believe that is why so many people love this movie. Pretty Woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there.

  The 15th Anniversary Special Edition also brought some never-before-seen scenes, deleted scenes, and commentary. The deleted scenes are also a must watch, they are just simply hilarious, and you also get to see how the actors were behind the scenes.

The modernized version of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion earned the young Roberts a Best Actress nomination and, more importantly, launched her into stardom.  Along with Richard Gere, the duo light up the silver screen turning a hopeless relationship into a lovely couple you can't help cheering for.

After his recent break-up, Wall Street broker Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) encounters Los Angeles prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts).  After one fun-filled night, Edward offers her $3000 to accompany him to all his business meetings for the duration of his visit.  Her hysterical reaction can only lead the viewer to believe one thing; she has accepted.  I couldn't resist her contagious smile.  It was interesting to see her interact with the high-class society.  Her journey to the posh Rodeo drive while in her original work clothes, which consisted of a micro-mini skirt and a quite revealing tank-top, was among the more memorable scenes of the film. After being denied service by snobbish shop workers, she later returned properly dressed in designer clothes to flaunt what kind of commission they missed out on.

 Jason Alexander played the role of Philip Stuckey, Edward's long time friend who disapproved his pal's lustful ways.  After his unsuccessful attempt at taking advantage of Vivian, he forces Edward to choose between his best friend and his new love.  I can't deny that I was happy, and almost teary-eyed, to see the lovely couple achieve the Cinderella ending one could only wish for.

I'm impressed with the number and quality of extras which are included inside this one release.  Even with all of the technology we now have, very few movies get such extensive anniversary releases.

I get a kick out of watching a young Julia Roberts and Richard Gere (were we all that young once?) parade around in late 80's fashions, but I've got to add my voice to the people who are questioning why Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) had to be a prostitute?

Even ruthless corporate raiders are going to have second thoughts about sleeping with prostitutes in the AIDS era--much less falling head over heels with one. Gere and Roberts truly are amazing actors for their subsequently having a career beyond this screen play. The large plot holes would have easily sunk less talented individuals.

If Gary Marshall did not want to have her actually look and act like a prostitute, then Vivian Ward needed to have been made into anything else. Surely there were other low-income and barely making it jobs in 1980s/1990's Los Angeles which could have provided the inspiration for consistent character development.

The production extras which tell what filming this movie was like were really funny. However, Marshall obviously did not know how to direct this film as it had been written. The film would have worked even better if Roberts's character had been anything else other than a prostitute.",1128556800,2,1499,4.956175298804781

Pretty Woman Tour"" which takes you on a trip to the various filming locations in Los Angeles, narrated by Garry Marshall.  The best extra is Marshall's audio commentary which is updated from the 10th Anniversary edition.  If you know the movie very well, it's a welcome addition.

Fortunately, you can skip the previews of other movies at the beginning of the disc by pressing the Menu button.

The sound seems better on this disc than the earlier DVD.  It has a better loudness ratio so the music is not too loud compared to the dialog.  This is the Widescreen 1.85:1 version.

Finally, I don't know why this film is rated ""R"".  There's virtually no nudity and they only curse three or four times during the whole movie.  PG-13 is more like it (which these days is ""R-Lite"" but oh well).

1) while the 15th anniversary version claims to be ""anamorphic widescreeen"", there is absolutely no difference in the size of the picture onscreen (the 10th anniversary version was also presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, making it ""anamorphic"");

2) that said, however, the picture quality of the 15th anniversary version is far superior to the 10th anniversary version, which is marred by dark shadowing and lots of grain - the 15th anniversary version is cleaned-up, with a much brighter picture and virtually devoid of grain or flecks;

3) while the 10th anniversary version was ""edited for content"", the 15th anniversary version is the full-length, unedited theatrical version;

4) the 15th anniversary version includes a few bonus extras and bloopers.

The bottom line is, if you're a fan of ""Pretty Woman"", a full-length, improved-picture version of the movie makes it a must-have. Get it - if for nothing else, your significant live-in lady will love you for it.",1127606400,186,1102,5.134078212290503
78801,4,0788821075,"This is a decent fun movie in all. Kind of a ""sleeper"" hit when it came out, you might want to check it out, if you haven't seen it. It will especially appeal to those who have dreams of being swept away by a ""prince charming."" In this case the prince is Gere, who is older, but that's seems cool (Micheal and Cathrine, Tom and Katie), and Roberts, who's hot (that's cool too). It is a ""interesting"" depiction of prostitution, it must be different in downtown L.A. than in my city. Here, the women on the streets are not as pretty as Julia Roberts or even her friend. As I've driven by them on my way out with friends, it's hard, difficult, impossible, to imagine some super rich billionare deciding to be with one of them. But, I guess in L.A. prostitues are all super-hot, really decent people on the inside, full of life wisdom and civility, that's just waiting to come out. There is a good extra scene of a time Gere is hasseled outside a bar by some ""punks"" and his driver shows off his gun and Gere tells the punks that he ""has a permit."" It's a good thing he does, street punks are often really concerned with the legality of the status of the people around them and most of them are probably lawyers just waiting for Ally McBeal to come rescue them on clean them up to find they are handsome, well-spoken, honest, gentlemen, just waiting to come out and be rich and perfect for Ally, or whoever.
So why buy:
Fun movie from the past
New scence (well hardly any)
VHS tapes will be a good relic for showing your grandkids
Good scene about hostile takeovers for quickly showing your Economics class
Julia/Richard are good looking people you can romanticize (if you're into that type of person/thing)
It's inexpensive
You might want to teach you children that money and wealth are sexy and cool, and the power that comes with them is important.

It is absolutely wrong to glamorize prostitution!  My heart goes to the women who make this bad choice, because it is out of desperation, or naivety and  with  consequences for a lifetime. The prostitutes experience sex in its ugliest form and probably never know the beauty of real lovemaking. Their reality is very different of what this film depicts, especially the reality of the streetwalkers. It's lonely, risky, dirty, humiliating existence and every attempt to glamorize it and compare it with Cinderella's story is an insult on human intelligence!

The plot and the characters are shallow, not to mention Vivien's dumb and unbelievable behaviour in the hotel's lift where she insults strangers who happen to be hotel guests, while her employer Edward simply smiles stupidly. Her best friend, also a prostitute, demonstrates the same bad manners, which shows that this is their nature. Still, somehow Vivien manages to transform herself to a fine lady in no time. Oh please, get real! It never works that way!

78803,4,0788821075,A wonderful rags to riches movie. Julia Roberts is luminous in her role. I have watched the movie several times and enjoy it as much as the first time I watched it. 4 big stars!,1126051200,2,177,4.085714285714285
78804,4,0788821075,"The first thing that strikes the audience after have viewed Pretty Woman is the contrasting similarities between the two leads.  One an aristocrat the other belongs to the lower class.  They share occupational immorality in their quest for money.  Neither fit into the other's environment, as each social setting requires a certain street smarts, or social etiquette, yet they manage with the help of the power of economic status.  Despite their financial differences they both share a mutual vision of integrity and righteousness.  Pretty Woman delivers a Cinderella story in the modern light where socioeconomic values are tested.

Turning tricks is what the high school dropout Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) has to do when money is short and rent is due.  It is not something she strives to do for a professional career, but her situation leaves her no other options than to seek monetary refuge in the oldest of professions.  Carefully Vivian approaches her job with protection of latex and cleanliness, as dangers lure around every corner.  In addition, Vivian must take care of her roommate Kit De Luca (Laura San Giacomo) who easily falls in the hands of the wrong company and drugs.

On occasion dreams come true, but there are no more knights in shining armor that come and save the day.  Instead the sharp businessman and billionaire Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) approaches Vivian's street in a Lotus Esprit that he handles feebly.  Lost and disoriented Edward requests Vivian's help, but she does not help him for free.  The situation leads Edward to hire her as a guide back to Beverly Hills where he is staying in a luxurious hotel's penthouse.  In turn it leads to a night and then a week that Edward hires Vivian's company, as he also has just broken up with his girlfriend hours before he met Vivian.

The time that Edward and Vivian spend together displays the differences between the two through awkward, yet amusing moments.  There are also moments where the social differences are accentuated through offensive behaviors towards Vivian and her presence while shopping in expensive stores.  However, Edward's presence, or known existence seem to be all Vivian needs in order to get out of trouble.  This strongly suggests that money rules, and a scene when Edward takes Vivian out shopping displays the ultimate truth of human greed.

The director Garry Marshall creates a fairy tale where impossible happens, a rich businessman falls in love with a cheap hooker.  For many it might be a dream, a dream worth dreaming, but it is also important to understand that dreams only come true through hard work.  This hard work is present in the film through Edwards' relentless efforts to continue to build his empire, which has helped him build fortune.  Another notion that emerges during the viewing is they both help one another to find a happier existence, which suggests that wealth is not everything in life.  All of these moral messages are brought out amidst the contrasting similarities in Pretty Woman, which delivers an adult and lightly amusing contemporary fairy tale.

One thing that hurts the film is its R rating, as the film presents adult material with a PG approach.  The notion of an adult themed fairy tale should be pondered in the light of the Brother's Grimm stories, which were disturbingly bloody and intended for children.  Nonetheless, Pretty Woman also offers the idea that violence and horror is not necessary to present at message.  However, the gentle method of telling the story of Vivian makes it a little too one-dimensional for an adult, and more intended for a teen audience.",1125014400,6,3622,4.973421926910299

78806,5,0788821075,"I had not seen this movie in a long time so I decided to get it and watch it again. Even after all these years, I still enjoyed watching this movie.

""Pretty Woman"" is about Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), a wealthy millionaire who is really bad with long term relationships. Enter Vivian (Julia Roberts), a prostitute that Edward accidentally meets to ask for directions. Edward feels something for her, and pays her to stay a week with him. However, during the week, they soon start falling for one another. But will they do anything to further their relationship?

This movie made Julia Roberts rise to stardom, and gave her an Oscar nomination too (which she deserved). She acted her role as the street smart Vivian Woods very well. Richard Gere also acted nicely as Edward Lewis. Furthermore, the chemistry between Gere and Roberts is sweet and original in the movie (and they also pair up with Garry Marshall in ""Runaway Bride""). The soundtrack for this movie adds well to the scenes. For example, Roxette's ""It Must Have Been Love"" when Edward and Vivian are separating from one another, or ""Fallen"" by Lauren Wood, when they are going to the Opera, adds nicely to the film. It gives a more 90s look to the film, which you don't see anymore these days. The DVD is not too bad either. It does have an audio commentary by Garry Marshall, along with the usual extras such as deleted scenes, theatrical trailers and production notes.

Basically, a fairy tale movie with a little reality added to it. If you liked this movie, some other movies that I would recommend are ""While You Were Sleeping"" and ""13 going on 30"".",1121904000,,1617,4.666666666666667

It's about the fact that studios want to milk the audience dry by re-issuing every DVD with new special features every few years. A movie comes out on DVD, people who liked the movie shell out money to own it. Fine. Then the studio comes along, throws in a few special features, re-issues the DVD, and expect people to buy it up too. Not just people who didn't own the original DVD, but those who did as well. And this time, not only have they done that once, they've done it twice! Put all the cards on the table; put all the special features on the first release, and then leave it alone.

78821,5,0788821075,"I think you all have forgotton one important fact. It's a movie!!! And it does not imply postitution is ok and fabulous. Why else would they write into the script the scene where the hooker is found dead in a dumpster, and the other hookers being addicts, and using money for drugs instead of rent. What makes it a love story is Gere rescues roberts from that kind of life, in which she didn't ever say she liked it or was proud, she wanted to get out of that life for good. As far as the girbil remark, don't believe everything you read in the tabloids or on CNN. And to say no rich guy has ever picked up a hooker. Ha! What world are you living in. Hugh Grant had a beautiful actress girlfriend waiting for him at home (Elizabeth Hurely!!), while he picked up a trashy diseased african american hooker in hollywood. And when Heidi Fleiss was running the high class prostitution company in hollywood do you seriously think no actors ever called. Hundreds did but she never gave names but we do know that Charlie Sheen admited to his picking up prositiutes back in the day. Just because you're rich and good looking it doesn't mean you'd never pay for sex. I'm sure 90 percent of all men have been with a hooker at least once and if you say never have you're probably lying. And yes Roberts is way too good looking to be a street walker. But it's just a movie. Every hooker's dream, to end up like cinderella. It's just a flick and a romantic tale about two similar people who fall in love, and if you paid close attention, gere did treat roberts well throughout the movie. He stuck up for her and told her she could be so much more. And she only took the money because she thought she could be professional and leave with no tears, because she didn't believe they could have a real life together until he proves her wrong at the end. Didn't you see the part when her feelings were hurt, after being propositioned by stuckie and she didn't take the money? That's called self respect because no money is worth being treated like you're nothing. You need to read between the lines if you want to understand the message in this movie. If you're smart, don't take things too seriously. I think Roberts is a fine actress and she really did a great job acting like a hooker at the beginning but then we realize she's a great person too who made some bad desicions in her life because we all have. She was gorgeous and adorable in this movie and it's a classic.",1117324800,17,2454,4.348583877995643

78823,3,0788821075,"One cannot watch PRETTY WOMAN without having a little fun at its expense.  Some have described this film as a modern day ""Cinderella"" story.  I describe it as another remake of MY FAIR LADY.  What is the difference?  Well, in PRETTY WOMAN our protagonist is a hooker.  Hence, the problem.  But I would like to cast my vote somewhere in the middle of these two extremes.  On the one hand, we can certainly understand the film's detractors.  While it is not fair to say that prostitution is glamorized in this film, it is conveniently hidden behind the razzle-dazzle of Julia Roberts's new life.  Naturally, in the real world this sort of thing would never happen.  Additionally, I too was somewhat appalled at the way money is used to improve the self-confidence of Roberts's character.

But PRETTY WOMAN is not entirely molded by these awkward premises and values.  For one, money is not completely glorified in this film, as Richard Gere seems to be having a crisis amid his endless pursuit of it.  Something is missing from his life and his unethical business practices are no longer fulfilling.  What he needs is a change: what he needs is, apparently, a hooker.  Seriously, however, PRETTY WOMAN only succeeds if you forget about the fact that Roberts is a streetwalker.  Remember, she is a smart girl and does not seem to fit into the hooker lifestyle.  Thus, we are supposed to treat her as a character who doesn't know what she is doing and ends up on the street as an accident of fate and low-confidence.  So should we be pissed off that a rich businessman saves her like a knight in shining armor?  I don't think so.  For let us not forget that both of our characters need saving, a point that the film makes quite clear, even in awkward dialogue.

In the end, I believe that the acting in this film is very good (particularly amongst the supporting cast), but that the awkward storyline and premise prevent the film from becoming a truly successful love story.  Watch it for its entertainment value and humor: there is plenty.  Just don't watch it expecting a great tale of fated lovers.",1116201600,,2097,4.653950953678474
78824,5,0788821075,"I couldn't believe some of the negative reviews to this movie. It's a fairy tale; the rules of the real world don't apply. But moreover, I've never agreed with some of the things said. I wanted to respond to some of the claims of those reviews: largely, the statements that this movie glorifies prostitution, and that it teaches you that money is self-respect.

Maybe the movie was supposed to be a cynical echo of those thoughts, but it certainly didn't turn out that way. Glorifies prostitution? Roberts' character, Vivien, is attacked by Edward's slick lawyer when he finds out what her job is. She tells Edward that it isn't something anyone dreams of doing, but she couldn't make rent, and the first time she did it she ""cried the whole time."" Vivien's friend, Kit, couldn't pick up the money Vivien left for her at first, because she had to hide from Carlos. Need symbolism? As a hooker, Vivien wore a short, platinum blonde wig: when she took off the wig, she pointed to her hair and said ""Red."" Edward said ""Better.""

As to the money - the fact that that Edward told salespersons to suck up to Vivien while she waved his credit card at them - well. As Edward says in the movie, he and Vivien are very alike: they ""both screw people for money."" Money is how they work and how they think; it's how they relate to people. More  importantly, however, is that you WATCH THAT CHANGE through the movie. Vivien turns down Edward's offer of an apartment to keep her off the streets - she told him ""it's just geography."" Why? Because she ""wants more"" now. She's going to San Francisco, planning on finishing high school. As for Edward? He turned down a BILLION DOLLAR DEAL so that he could build boats. Boats, people.

The movie is a fairy tale for adults. It isn't trying to say this happy ending is common - it's just one amazing story of an amazing place. Kind of like a new ""far, far away."" It's like the random guy who talks at the end of the film: ""Welcome to Hollywood! ...Some dreams come true. Some don't...but keep on dreaming.""

I love this movie. It's Cinderella, people. It's about as probable as fairy godmothers and magic pumpkins, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun.",1114300800,2,2180,4.536895674300254
78825,1,0788821075,"Plausible story of a rich homosexual man who falls in love with a dirty prostitute. Makes sense. Happens all the time.

I may not be able to sit through the romantic shy-girl-gets-the-guy movies because they sicken me, but I'll take ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""Ice Princess"" and many others in the braindead chick-flick vein to avoid having to watch this.

If I were a Dad, I would ban this movie from my children's viewing, be they boys or girls. Because this movie sends out every possible wrong message....

Prostitution is a way to get by. Like waitressing to put yourself through school. Hey, maybe it's even glamorous. These girls seem to be having fun, right?

Why NO scenes of Julia smoking crack, being gang raped, or getting razored by her pimp for not bringing in enough dash? Too real, I guess. Takes away from the fairy tale, like that bummer ""Leaving Las Vegas"" reality check flick.

Oh, and money equals love. Big Richie doesn't do much more than buy her stuff and get her into froo-froo stores for snobs to prove his devotion. How can women sit through a movie like this? I am a straight man and even I'm offended!

The only good thing about the movie is Roy Orbison's song, which was ruined for me once it became associated with this atrocity.

78839,5,0788821075,"Richard Gere and Julia Roberts star in the 1990 instant classic Pretty Woman. Nominated for a Academy Award for Best Actress, Roberts shows off her winning smile and wonderful wit as Vivian, a down on her luck prostitute and Richard Gere plays multi-millionaire Edward Lewis, who is a hard nosed real estate tycoon that puts the screws to other people by ripping their businesses out from under their noses.

 The story begins as Vivian leaves her apartment avoiding her landlord looking for rent money and Edward is finishing his talk with his lawyer about the upcoming meeting with the head of one of the businesses they are trying to take over.  Neither of them realized that the lives that they were escaping from would never be the same the next morning.

 They meet as Edward stops at Vivian's street corner. He is having trouble driving his lawyer's sports car. As Vivian is pushed towards the car, Edward realizes that he is also lost and needs to find his hotel. Vivian starts this modern day tale of Cinderella by asking him if wants some company.  Edward brings her into his carriage and asks if she would like to drive. Seems that she likes sports cars and knows a little bit more about the car than what he does. He tells her that he never drives because he is chauffeured around in limousines. She tells him of her tales from home and the boys she learned about cars from. The movie progresses as Edward hires Vivian to be his companion for the week as he visits Los Angeles.

 Edward sends her out to buy more conservative clothing more befitting a woman of her beauty and charm for the rest of the week that they would be together.  The rest of the movie details how they spent that week as Vivian is introduced into the world of big money. I can't explain the rest of the story without ruining the movie but I can tell you that its' genuine appeal as a classic is due to the acting performances of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Julia Roberts' performance for 119 minutes as Vivian is something that most women can relate to in this modern day fairy tale.

78841,5,0788821075,"Pretty Woman was the first sleeper of 1990. (The second that year was ""Ghost"" which stomped a dozen bigger budgeted action movies in its wake that summer) To the executives of Disney affiliate Hollywood Pictures the movie was a low-budget throwaway film expected to quickly bomb. Released in February 1990, the film quickly caught on with audiences. To everyone's surprise that year, Pretty Woman made over $175 million dollars in ticket sales. Today the movie is a classic Romantic comedy.

Julia Roberts gives a breakthrough performance in Pretty Woman. Her portrayal of Vivian the hooker with a heart got her an Oscar nomination. In J.F. Lawton and Gary Marshall's modern Cinderella story the working girl runs into Richard Gere's Prince charming Executive. He ""hires"" her to be an escort for a week for the ""three thousand"" dollars (the original title). During that week there's romance and hilarious comedy. The movie's too good to spoil; you'll have to buy it to see how it turns out. Other breakthrough performances include a pre Seinfeld Jason Alexander (he's at his best here), Laura San Giacamo (Just Shoot Me) and Hector Elizondo. This film helped establish these three stars careers.

It pays not to take the story seriously; it's a fairy tale set in modern times. The film is not a misogynist statement glamorizing prostitution, just a movie plain and simple. Take it as that and leave it as that. Pretty Woman is a feel-good film that will put a smile on your face. I highly recommend this movie.

Unfortunately, glamorizing prostitution isn't the way to go, and did you notice that the original VHS cover made no mention of Vivian's profession?  Granted, Vivian is a likable character, but it's far more likely that she would go the original route in this movie.

A few scenes latter, they're arguing and Lewis says something like, ""I never treated you like a whore.""

He did treat her like one, though. I know I was disturbed, both by the sex and by the arrogance involved. I'm not disturbed by sexual content, but THIS sex scene ruined any empathetic equity Edward Lewis had earned up to that point. He became, in my mind, just another John. Well, not just another John... a John rich enough to retain the services of a hooker for an extended period of time. I haven't had any love for the uber-rich since I stopped watching the Richie Rich cartoon show.

So, from that point onward, it ceases to be simply a brainless romantic comedy, and becomes a study in Stockholm Syndrome masquerading as love. Edward Lewis is revealed as a psychologically manipulative person who is power-tripping on his own obscene wealth, and Vivian Ward is a willing abuse victim who is willing to sell not only her body, but her integrity as well.",1092787200,19,1145,4.607843137254902

Julia Roberts became America's beloved actress in this classic movie.  She won the hearts of audiences throughout the land by playing the part of a prostitute swept into a fairytale life by a wealthy business man.  The business man, played by Richard Gere, hired her to be his companion for a week while in L.A.  The otherwise cold and emotionless tycoon soon melts because of Roberts' charm and hidden natural innocence.  She goes from being on the mean streets to enjoying luxurious bubble baths in a fine hotel, shopping in the most exquisite clothing stores, and wearing dazzling jewelry at upscale parties in what seems like the blink of an eye.  Although there are a few problems due to the couples' very different backgrounds, love prevails, and they enjoy happiness beyond what either had imagined.  The movie portrays America's fascination of seeing the ""underdog"" win in the end, as well as the rags-to-riches story we all love so much.

78864,4,0788821075,"Pretty Woman starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere is a romantic movie about a young woman, Vivian, who is a hooker for a living and one day stumbles upon Edward, a handsome and successful businessman. He needs to get to a certain destination and she gets him there in his beautiful sports car which he can hardly maneuver himself.  Although their romance starts as an accidental meeting, after spending a short time with her he falls for her.  He lets her remain in his hotel for a couple of days and attempts to transform her because he sees all the potential she has.  Initially he falls for her because of her physical beauty, like most men do.  They survey the women in front of them and decide who they will be with.  As the days go by he tries to change the way she dresses in order for her to look more ladylike and so that she could fit the role of an ideal woman with not only her physical beauty but her attire as well.  He tries to make her look as though she is from the high society by allowing her to shop at Beverly Hills with his credit cards of course.  He clearly displays a stereotype of men which is that they feel that they need to take care of their women and keep them looking beautiful as though they were objects because the woman that they are with reflect somewhat how they will be seen by others.
Although Vivian has a job that is not seen as commendable, she is independent.  She pays for her rent and supports herself alone.  The arrival of Richard in her life changes that. He offers her luxuries she has never seen and she takes them.  She transforms herself to fit the image of a woman he would fall in love with, which he does, but not solely because she changed her appearance but because he saw her charm right from the start.  Although this movie seems to be a typical boy meets girl, boy falls for girl because she is beautiful it is not.  It's a sweet, captivating story that displays that two people from two different worlds with different economic backgrounds and views on the world can fall for eachother.  However, it is not realistic that a woman struggling as she was would suddenly meet Price Charming.",1084320000,,2152,4.376884422110553
78865,3,0788821075,"What is it that has enabled Pretty Woman to be renowned as a modern-day fairy tale? Fairy tales usually provide a substantial moral that leave both children and adults with warm and fuzzy feeling inside. Was the moral of Pretty Woman that all it takes is some expensive clothes to confer respectability? In all fairness, Pretty Woman does play upon the idealistic feelings of its viewers. A ""rags to riches"" story, Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) gets to live out the ultimate fantasy in which she is able to change a man into her own ""Prince Charming."" And of course, Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), playing a cold businessman, obliges her. In an instance, Vivian is transformed into the world's most wholesome prostitute (isn't that a double negative?). Never mind that she outrightly states that she'll screw anyone who'll pay. Vivian is ""tall, cute and clean"" - completely opposite to the sickly-looking hookers you really see on a neighborhood corner nearest you. The cheerful depiction of prostitution in this film is absolutely disgusting, and oh yeah, nothing short of a fairy tale.

  In addition, why is the message ""the clothes make the man"" continually being sent to viewers? This idea may hold true during a job interview, however, the idea is not only demoralizing, but also wins the prize for being most shallow. In the film Trading Places, Eddie Murphy plays a homeless man who not only gains respect through his suit and tie, but also by exuding an intelligent and charismatic style. This is what enables him to successfully fool others in thinking he is a rich businessman. All Vivian manages to promote with her spiffy clothes is the idea that men will forever and always be surveyors and that she is trapped in a panopticon. What a shame...I'm trapped in a male-dominated society where bums get to be businessmen and prostitutes get to be ""pretty women.""",1084233600,,1867,4.901898734177215

Vivian does her thing and talks Edward into hiring her for the week for the amount of $3000.  In order for her to do her job, she must go shopping for some new clothes.  She encounters the first signs of prejudice when the store clerk will not wait on her.  On her way back up to the hotel room the hotel manager stops her and to her surprise, he helps her in every way he can.
As the film progresses, Vivian starts to fall in love with Edward.  When Edward's lawyer discovers Vivian's true identity, he tries to attack her, but Edward intervenes.  Vivian then realizes that she could never belong in Edward's world.
After the week is over, Edward gives Vivian her pay.  She goes home and starts to pack.  She wants to go back to school and make something of her life, but at the same time she is missing Edward.

78880,5,0788821075,"There seems to be two schools of thought regarding this movie.  There are those who are unable to see past Julia's profession, and all it might entail, and there are those who see how someone who clearly had to make a bad choice one day realized it, and along the way helped someone else realize the bad choices they had made.  It's all a charming fairy tale that I have watched over and over again.
Julia Roberts does play a prostitute.  However, as the movie unfolds we find out why.  Further, we also find that Julia is, as she must be, human, and has the same core values that most of us have.  Richard Gere helps her realize during their discussions that she made a poor choice, and eventually Julia realizes that she can be and wants to be more than she is.
During Julia's journey of discovery she also makes Richard Gere question the path in life that he has chosen.  Richard buys companies, takes them apart, and sells the pieces for more than he paid for them.  While it has made Richard a very wealthy man, Julia questions the value that Richard brings to the world.  As Julia realizes that she wants more self-fulfillment in her life, Richard realizes that he wants to be constructive instead of destructive.
Julia's character could have been played in an exploitive way that demeaned her character, and her character's profession.  Instead, I thought the subject was handled sensitively and well.  Julia several times could have behaved just as Richard would have expected someone in her profession, and yet, she showed that she had pride and values, and she stuck to them, even to her detriment.  Ultimately Richard Gere, and the audience, comes to admire Julia Roberts as a strong woman with an incredible will.
In addition to Julia Roberts and Richard Gere is an outstanding supporting cast, including Laura San Giacomo as Julia's friend and roommate, and who gives Julia no end of despair in her choices.  Hector Elizondo plays Barney Thompson, the hotel manager, and he makes the role and steals every scene in which he appears.  Jason Alexander plays a rather despicable right hand man to Richard Gere, calloused, ruthless and crude.  Ralph Bellamy is the head of a business that Richard Gere is attempting to take over, and who gives Richard the best compliment in the entire film, marking a turning point in Richard Gere's attitude about what he does.  There is a long list of other actors that made so many of the scenes in this movie funny and sometimes poignant.  Better you should watch this movie and find out for yourself.
This movie is one of Richard Gere and Julia Robert's best films.  We have both the video tape and the DVD, and have watched both multiple times, and will likely watch the DVD many more times.  Funny and often touching, this is a wonderful film for adults with a soft spot in their hearts for underdogs and believing that good things happen to good people.",1082073600,,2904,4.671905697445973

78882,4,0788821075,"Blessed was the day, the day that Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) chose to sell her flesh for coin.
Blessed was the day, the day, that after having sold her flesh to countless sinners, Vivian Ward met a really good looking and wealthy sinner named Edward Lewis (Richard Gere).
Blessed was Edward Lewis, the ruthless tycoon who performed leverage buyouts of all his rival's companies beginning with his hated father's but not ending there.
Blessed was the leverage buyout, an exclusive and cutthroat mode of business operations in which private equity firms specialized in the high-risk process of accumulating capital from very wealthy investors and subsequently using it to buy failing companies and then selling off their parts for gains of up to 25% or, for staggering losses of equal or greater proportion.
Blessed was the metaphor of the leveraged buyout since blessed Edward Lewis, used his massive accumulation of capital to ""buy out"" blessed Vivian Ward's body for the night.
Blessed was Philip Stuckey (Jason Alexander), Edward's heinous attorney, whose crass request and subsequent forceful demands for Vivian's flesh-selling services aptly contrasted Edward's more gentlemanly approach thus making him look like a sweet guy instead of a villain for subjecting Vivian's flesh to a leveraged buyout.
Blessed was the fact that this film made flesh selling actually look pretty cool since it could land a gal in a pretty nice hotel with a wealthy, handsome, but somewhat morose and deeply misunderstood leverage buyout tycoon.
Blessed was flesh selling which might be my next career if I get canned from my completely un-cinematic job for authoring documents such as this one.
Blessed was the way that Edward didn't really save Vivian from the streets since, once it looked like their brief affair was over, she pretty much opted out of that lifestyle anyway.
Blessed was the fact that there wasn't a pimp in the film to slap her around and say, ""You think you're getting out of this racket just like that? Get out there and go make me some more money!""
Blessed was the fact that flesh selling had not ravaged Vivian's body nor subjected her to countless potentially lethal forms of sect-chew-Ali transmitted ills.
Blessed was the fact that Vivian really had more of the intelligence and personality that suited her to garden parties than to a life of flesh selling on the streets.
Blessed was the way that Vivian transformed Edward from a morose and heartless destroyer of other people's livelihood into a saint who would gladly fork over some investment capital to try to make a failing business succeed.
Blessed was the fact that this capitalized on the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold stereotype that's been with us since biblical times.
Blessed was the fact that this film ended.
Blessed was the fact that I never saw it again.
Blessed was the fact that my students in Taiwan really liked it and asked me what I thought of it.
Blessed was the fact that I said, ""Well, I think it teaches girls that hooking is a pretty viable career choice.""",1078790400,4,3044,4.982318271119843

78884,5,0788821075,"Does this movie glorify being a hooker? That's what Roseanne thinks. But who cares what she thinks anyway! This is a great movie, and even though it does kinda sorta glorify being a hooker (with the hopes of falling in love with a rich guy), you can pretty much say that every movie glorfies something that shouldn't be glorified.
Julia plays Vivianne, a relatively inexperienced hooker. Right away she meets Edward (Gere), who is rather coy around Vivianne, but invites her up to his room anyway. This leads to a week long agreement that she will be his arm piece for social functions and at the end of the week, she'll get $3,000 big ones.
She has rules to avoid attachment, but can Vivianne resist this hunky rich guy who (even though he says he isn't) is sweeping her off her feet?
This movie is truly wonderful. Roberts innocence shines through her character. There are lots of great one-liners in this movie, some true laugh out loud moments. Don't let the premise scare you away... it's much tamer and sweeter than alot of people make it out to be. So see this movie.

This is the one Julia Roberts film that can never be out-done. No amount of Erin Brockovich's can beat this movie. This catapulted Julia into the big-time, mainstream movies, and she's now one of the highest paid actresses. I dunno whether something like Pretty Woman was never done before this, or whether I'm just sick of Julia Roberts now, but she won't come across a script as good as this again. Not even the supposed ""sequel"", with Richard Gere & Julia reteaming (they could go all the way and do a Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks) with Garry Marshall and Hector Elizondo for Runaway Bride. Nowhere near as good. But that's a different movie.
The actors are great, and I think it's the only Richard Gere movie I've ever seen - apart from Runaway Bride. The night elevator operator's face (Patrick Richwood) is an absolute picture most of the time, and he makes you laugh just by looking at him.
Of course, everyone knows that Julia's character, Vivian, turns from a poor hooker, into a rich lady. I much prefer Vivian as the hooker. When you first meets Edward (Richard Gere), she's fine, she's cute, and he gives her all this money, and she turns into a frumpy, awkward lady. The clothes are ill-fitting and really don't suit her.
In a few years, when Julia Roberts is old and grey (Richard Gere already was old & grey in this!), this will be considered a classic.
Watch out for a very much blink and you'll miss him role of the detective, played by Hank Azaria. I've seen this movie a hundred times, and it's the first time I noticed him!
The songs are terrific in this, from Roy Orbison's ""Pretty Woman"" to Natalie Cole's ""Wild Women Do"" (the video is not impressive though). The best song is of course, Roxette's ""It Must Have Been Love"", played as Vivian leaves Edward. It's a very poignant scene, and I always play this song if I'm feeling down about something. The lyrics match any relationship problem perfectly, and matches the scene in Pretty Woman.",1074384000,4,2149,4.584415584415584

One great moment among many: when Vivian wakes up in Edward's palatial penthouse suite ""the morning after"" and he offers her breakfast instead of making her leave immediately, her pleasure and surprise are touching. She grabs a roll off the breakfast table like a starving waif, as if she almost doesn't dare and is afraid it'll be snatched away. It's impossible not to like Vivian, and to root for her. She's irresistible.

A solid cast benefits from Garry Marshall's surefooted direction. Elinor Dohanue (Betty Anderson/""Princess"" from Father Knows Best) shines in a bit part. Jason Alexander, who would go on to fame and fortune in later years as George Costanza on Seinfeld, leaves a slime trail across the screen as Edward's lawyer, Phil Stuckey. Laura San Giacomo is completely believable as Kit De Luca, Vivian's fellow streetwalker and roommate.

78926,4,0788821075,"The classical drama ""Pretty Woman"", directed by Garry Marshall and with actor Richard Gere (Edward Lewis) and actress Julia Roberts (Vivian Ward) was really hilarious.  Julia Roberts won Best Actress in 1990 at the Academy Awards and Best Actress in 1991 at the Golden Globe for her performance in this move.  I can see why! Julia Roberts with her beautiful smile was a wonderful actor in her role as a prostitute and then portraying a woman who is of class and wealth.  She really gave herself away when she walked in those high heels though and her talk.
Edward Lewis is rich businessman who recently broke up with his girlfriend.  Edward is in Los Angeles on business and he gets lost on his way to Beverly Hills Hotel.  He gets acquainted with Vivian (Julia Roberts) when he stops to ask for directions on Hollywood Boulevard. Vivian is prostitute and she thinks he is looking for some action.  She gets in the car to show Edward to Beverly Hills Hotel.  After she spends the night in his room, he asks her to stay the week and how much it will cost him for her to stay.  Edward needs Vivian to escort to the rich parties so he gives he money to purchase clothes to wear.  This is a once in lifetime opportunity for Vivian as her and Edward is from two different worlds.
Edward begins to see that Vivian is more than just a prostitute, that she is beautiful, fun to be around and that she makes him feel like a better person.  However, Vivian has to deal with Phil (Jason Alexander) a co-worker of Edward's who keeps reminding her of her past and that this relationship will never work.  Vivian is given a chance to start her life all over again and not have to live on the streets to make ends meet.
I love movies with Richard Gere he is so handsome.  And Julia Roberts is just beautiful I cannot think of any other person who could have played pretty woman in this movie.  I give this movie 4 star for romance and comedy mixed together.  It kept me laughing and yet the romantic part is every woman's dream.  I just hope young women do not look at this movie and think that being a prostitute is okay way of life and that this could happen to them.",1060128000,,2154,4.363408521303258

She plays Vivien, a Hollywood hooker who lands it in the big leagues when financier, Edward Lewis (Richard Gere)pays her to be seen with him for one week.  Of course, they fall in love.  The Cinderella story proved irresistable to audiences in the 90's, making the movie a sleeper hit that continues to be regarded as great cinema even though, at best, its diversionary fluff with a kick.
Unfortunately, there's nothing pretty about this tired transfer.  Colors, although occasionally well balanced, often exhibit a pinkish characteristic and at times are way too brightly realized.  Contrast levels are generally lower than one would expect. Chips and scratches in the original negative are present and noticable throughout. Edge enhancement is detected and bothersome.  Pixelization occasionally makes an unwelcomed inclusion into the bargain basement transfer quality.  The 1:85:1 widescreen picture is not even anamorphically enhanced - WHY?!? After previously issuing this movie on a director's cut DVD, with the same deplorable image quality, we get a 10th anniversary edition reissue that adds nothing new, save a mini-featurette and theatrical trailer to the mix.  The audio, 5.1 remastered, sounds adequate enough though it is dated.

78949,5,0788821075,"Movie Review: Pretty Woman
 Pretty Woman is an old tale-with a whole new twist.  This sweet and provocative film can be paralleled to the Disney classic ""Cinderella"", yet its success as ""best entertainment for the romantic"" cannot be matched by any other movie in its genre.
 Vivian Ward (played by Julia Roberts) is a prostitute on the frequented streets of Los Angeles.  Her mouth is as big as her 80's style hairdo and her dreams for love in the future appear to be unrealistic.
 Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) is a hotshot businessman with only one thing on his mind: business.  Never the twain shall meet, right?  Wrong.  On one fateful night Edward takes a wrong turn in his flashy car and meets Vivian, who is out ""working her corner"".
These two opposites engage in hilarious and innocent flirting until Edward decides to keep Vivian for one week for the hefty sum of four thousand dollars!  For Vivian it is the chance of a lifetime.
 Throughout the movie you learn a little bit about what makes each of them tick and why, while they come from opposite ends of the spectrum, Vivian and Edward make the perfect pair.  Yet after one week is up, will all-business Edward throw his morals out the window and confess his love, or will Vivian just return home four thousand dollars richer?
 This is a movie about finding true love in the most unexpected places, giving respect in order to earn it in return, and the uniqueness of each person.  It will teach you that you never stop learning in life, and that where affairs of the heart are concerned,
anything  ( or anyone) is a possibility!
 Pretty Woman  will have you laughing out loud one minute, and swooning the next.  If romantic comedies are your kind of film, this one is sure to become your favourite by the end of the night!",1039305600,,1784,4.577287066246057

This is the first time I've seen this movie after all these years of hearing all positive things about it. But I guess everyone's taste is different. I laughed only a couple times.

78952,5,0788821075,"The viewer's assignment will be to put away reasoning and suspend belief for 125 minutes to enter that spinner-of-the-make-believe world of Los Angeles.  Specifically seedy Hollywood streets filled with neon lights, drugs, and hookers.  While at the other end of the spectrum, Beverly Hills gleams with the rich and beautiful people roaming Rodeo Drive shops for designer goodies and cavorting on polo fields to stomp down divots kicked up during the rough and tumble of the matches (galloping horses, swinging mallets and all that, you know).
It will take great imagination to pretend that Julia Roberts is destined for a sleazy half life as a street walker, sleeping all day before getting up to put on her messy blonde wig and shiny, over-the-knee stiletto boots to claim her territory on the mean streets and wave at the johns.  She dreams of a fairy tale ""prince charming rescuing beautiful maiden and they live happily ever after"" but is too busy keeping it together for herself and ditzy roommate, Kit, to have a clue about finding her dream.
Enter Edward (Richard Gere):  It's no stretch to make him fit his character.  He is handsome, super rich, successful in business and with a carefully shielded heart that prohibits becoming close to any person because he never lived up to Dad's idea of the 'perfect son'.  Pretend that he'd rather hire a hooker for a week so he can concentrate on business.
Now the FUN part begins.  These two meet, a proposition is made, is accepted and Edward turns Vivian loose on Rodeo with his charge card.  The rest of the movie is pure magic.  It's not 'real life' -- it's the movies.  Enjoy it for all that it is.
Since I need a touch of 'Fairy Tale' every so often it was a perfect choice to own on DVD.

Richard Gere is a great choice for a costar as he really fits the bill of a suave businessman.  The premise is pure, but the plot is seedy.  Julia is a prostitute with big aspirations squelched somehow by society, seemingly leaving her only this foul choice to make a living.  Gere is a filthy rich businessman who is out of town and needs a date for a dinner party.  Oddly, he thinks a hooker is the logical choice.  Yet, it works.  Julia fumbles through the etiquette of a world unfamiliar which lends the humor to this romantic comedy.  The chemistry between Roberts and Gere provides the romance that made this movie so very famous.  A star the size of Julia Roberts is not born of a bad movie.

The director Garry Marshall captures a fairy tale about a street-wise prostitute who meets her prince charming.  He portrays Vivian the street-wise prostitute as a person who you can't help but fall in love.  Vivian captures Edward's eye when she drives his friends borrowed car to his hotel.  She shows him that there is more to her then meets the eye.
They arrive at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel and go up to the penthouse.  Here Vivian attempts to get Edward to face one of his fears and have him come out to the patio and look at the beautiful view.  They spend the evening together and the next day Edward asks Vivian to be his companion for the week.  He leaves her a wad of cash and wants her to go out and buy some clothes.  She does what every woman would do go shopping on Rodeo Drive.  She gets snubbed by the snobbish shopkeepers and goes back to the hotel without any clothing.  The hotel manager places an important phone call and helps her out with her clothing problem.  He also assists her with learning the importance of silverware.
Even though Vivian may get treated like ... trash in different parts of the movie, you will not see her like this at all.  Edward never once says anything to make her feel like this or gives you the impression that he even remotely thinks of her like ... trash.  He sees her as a beautiful woman who just took the wrong turn on the road of life.
Vivian and Edward attend many events together including the opera and an evening meal with flying oysters.  Vivian will keep you on your seat with her wit and talent.

I rate the original movie five stars.  However, this new edition is a GREAT disappointment.

There are cute scenes of Julia learning to dress, buy clothes, use the proper fork. She's not quite as bad as the gal in Pygmalion, but then again, this is an R-rated version, so it's a sexier story, Imagine if Professor Higgins could bed his ""student,"" Eliza Doolittle

Hector Alizondo has a great role, playing the all knowing, always wise hotel manager (think hispanic Yoda<g>) who helps Julia pull herself together.
It's fun to see Jason Alexander as a bumbling creep (recently revisited in Shallow Hal.)
The thing that puts that magic into this story is the character arcs Julia and Richard go through.
Richard goes from an emotionally constricted, greedy financial power czar to become a kinder, more generous guy who cares about the people and the businesses he has been playing Monopoly with, and he (Big surprise) falls for Julia. (who wouldn't? <G>)
Julia evolves to become a more self aware, sophisticated, but still playful and simple, honest and straightforward woman (though still a goodhearted ""'ho."") She has this wonderful, playful nature that loaned itself so well to this story line.
This is, even after many other roles, still one of Julia's best (along with Notting Hill and Erin Brockovich.)  If you were, not surprisingly, disappointed with  America's Sweetheart, watch this film for a pick-me-up and a reminder of how good Julia can be.
The film also won the best film of the year from the People's Choice Awards and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen from the Writer's Guild of America. Richard Gere won a Golden Globe for best Actor that year.",1006992000,6,2223,4.826771653543307

Edward hires Vivian for a week so he desn't have to deal with his two previously failed relationships (one with a girlfriend, and one with his ex-wife)for the week.
While Edward puts in long working days with ne client after another, Vivian lives the high life at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, goes shopping on Rodeu Drive (after being turned away by the snubby shopkeepers), goes to a mach of Polo, and goes to the Oprea in San Francisco (they take his jet).
In the midst of all this, Vivian and Edward fall in love, it's as simple as that. Julia Roberts, in the role that made her a star, gives a simply wonderful, witty, hillarious, and heart touching performance. Richard Gere gives a great performace as well, but he obviously falls back in the light Julia shines on this film, she is without a dought the star!
If you love Julia Roberts (and who wouldn't, she's a great actress!)this is the film to see! After all, it made her a star, and is a great example of her early work. Roberts and Gere are such a great team, they were later teamed again in Runaway Bride. If you love Runaway Bride, you'll love Pretty Woman.

Also, in the past, I suspected that there was more to life than money and good looks, but 'Pretty Woman' set me straight on that one: boy, was I wrong!  Money is the most important thing in the world.  It even makes love possible.  Having been taught so many important lessons about life, I think it only fair that we, the viewing public, reward the producers and stars of this film with many millions of dollars - it might even be fair to call them prostitutes too, and to consider ourselves, the audience, as their clients.",993254400,51,863,4.577922077922078

(2) Even more nauseating:  Happiness is a credit card.  The worst scene in the movie -- which i vividly remember 10 years later -- is that the great gift that Gere gives to Roberts is not love or self-respect -- it's the ability to wave his credit card in the faces of the snooty salespeople who looked down on her.

79009,5,0788821075,"Pretty Movie
 The 80's was quite an era for movies with The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, Goonies.  However there is one movie which stands out in my mind, Pretty Woman.  The audience quickly falls in love with the uplifting, inspiring fairytale brought to life.  Julia Roberts and Richard Greer give memorable performances Roberts portraying a lost prostitute doing whatever it takes to make ends meet when she falls upon Richard Greer, a rich successful business man, in trouble on the wrong side of town.  These two meet by accident but fall in love by chance making for a moving, romantic film with an incredible message and talented actors.  Due to its storyline and message as well as the talented actors that help bring the screen to life Pretty Woman is the best movie of the eighties.  Pretty Woman is a perfect example that dreams do come true and bad times will only get better.  Vivian, played by Julia Roberts, is stuck on the bad side of town selling her body in order to survive.  At heart she is not the slutty, no body prostitute type and all it takes is a little fate to save her from the streets of Los Angeles.  Edward, played by Richard Greer, comes roaring through town in an expensive sports car obviously catching the attention of the girls on the corner.  Vivian approaches him not knowing this man will change her life.  Edward saves Vivian from the streets and Vivian saves Edward from his workaholic, heartless ways.  These complete opposites end up falling in love and making the other person better than ever.  Vivian reminds Edward to live life and see beyond work. Edward gives Vivian a chance to be more than a sex toy giving her confidence and the push she needs to straighten out and become the woman which lies within.  This movie illustrates the thought that people come in our lives for a reason.  Love does conquer all and the dreams of a fairytale romance can come true.  As the fairytales always go the poor, hopeless, unpromising girl can become the princess when her prince charming sees beyond the exterior and into her soul.  A good story line can only be effective when talented actors bring the feelings and emotions to life.  Julia Roberts and Richard Greer do just that with their incredible on screen chemistry and ability to become the characters they are portraying.  The spark between Roberts and Greer is present from the first moment their characters meet.  Their body language creates the mood of attraction and desire.  The audience becomes engulfed in the characters growing love for each other and the way each compliments the personality of the other.  Opposites can attract; Greer's rigid and stressed working character is perfect for Vivian's carefree, unorganized demeanor.  With out the talent of these two actors the chemistry between the characters would not have been as effective and apparent.  The way each of actors become the character they are portraying makes the film even more memorable and close to the hearts of it's audience.  Greer and Roberts made the movie!  A good storyline? ... CHECK ... Good actors to play the roles effectively? ... CHECK, proving Pretty Woman is the best flick of the eighties and it have proven it's self over and over again as each generation falls in love with the film.  The brought to life fairytale of Pretty Woman is hard not to fall in love with, the movie gives people hope and a warm feeling about love and romance.  The on screen chemistry makes each look and touch seem filled with real life meaning and love.  Roberts and Greer are perfect to work together and their talents have been seen again in later movies such as Run Away Bride.  Pretty Woman is a movie I cannot get enough of, it will continue to be viewed for years to come.

There is no other actress who could've played her role with such vitality and vigour. Richard Gere is just as impressive - but what else could you expect from these two stars?  The soundtrack also makes this movie worth watching.

79014,4,0788821075,"This film catapulted Julia Roberts to superstardom and with good reason.  The film itself is a light but entertaining romantic comedy about a wealthy and unemotional corporate raider (Richard Gere) and a flamboyant hooker (Julia Roberts).  The story isn't that original, being a variation on the ""love on the wrong side of the tracks"" theme.  However, it is full of charming and funny moments and Roberts' audacious effervescence is the perfect contrast to Gere's impassive macho persona.  The film had enormous popular appeal and surprised everyone, grossing $178 million in the U.S. and $463 million worldwide, establishing Roberts as one of the most bankable stars in a generation.
At only 21, Roberts was a fresh talent with sexy girl-next-door looks who showed she could light up the screen with her acting.  With the guidance of veteran sitcom director Garry Marshall (""The Odd Couple"", ""Happy Days"", ""Mork and Mindy"", ""Murphy Brown""), she was transformed from a tall and pretty model type into a delightful romantic figure with an extraordinary sense of comic timing who earned a best actress nomination for her performance.
The new DVD includes a good deal of footage that was left out of the theatrical release, and the commentary by Garry Marshall is rich in interesting trivia about the production.  For instance, he tells how Julia Roberts was so nervous about her first nude scene with Richard Gere that she broke out in hives, and they spent the entire day applying calamine lotion and makeup all over her to hide the blotches.  Also, the now famous scene where Gere snaps the lid of the jewelry case on her fingers was not intended to be in the film.  Marshall instigated a prank because Julia was dragging and he wanted to wake her up.  So, he told Gere to impishly snap the lid when she went to touch the necklace, and her reaction was so delightful that they kept it.
This is a fun film that is worth seeing again now that it has been released on DVD.  I rated it an 8/10.  Though it is ridiculously implausible, it is enchanting and amusing throughout.  It is also an excellent look at Julia Roberts' early work, when she only earned $300,000 rather than $20 Million per film.",980380800,10,2195,4.808510638297872

Instead of ""Lights, lights would be good here"" the two main characters discuss condoms and safe sex.  It goes downhill from there.  Some beloved scenes are just gone.  This is a gritter look at Vivian Ward and her life as a prostitute.  The glossed over lovable Hollywood romance now has a darker side - a side I did not like.  I have seen B versions of other movies and those were OK.  This was the first time that the rhythm, feel, and overal essence of a movie has been altered so dramatically.

79036,5,0788821075,"Was the title for one of the best reviews I read for Pretty Woman back when I was only fifteen years of age. I was forbidden to see the film, my mother thinking I would instantly be standing on street corners looking for Lotuses, but I saw it anyway. Three times. When it came on video I watched it until the tape died and I needed to buy another, and another. Then, I bought a DVD player JUST for it. I've gotten into many heated discussions about how this movie degrades women and gives young girls the wrong ideas about things. But that is NOT how I look at it at all.
My favorite scene in the movie is when Vivian and Edward are in bed, talking and Vivian goes on about how she ended up in Los Angeles to begin with by following a ""bum"" that her mother called her a ""bum magnet"" ""If there was a bum within a fifty mile radius I was completly attracted to him."" But the line that stuck with me the most was ""When people put you down enough you start to believe it"" and Edward replies ""I think you are a very charming, very beautiful woman"" Vivians reply is full of emotion when she replies ""The bad stuff is easier to believe...have you ever noticed that?"" Which is true.
Maybe it's just me, but I think that this movie is just a fairytale, and fairytales are there to make you believe in something that is totally unbelievable. This movie gives you hope, show's you that even if you're life is misserable, that even if you are a bum magnet; if you don't give up hope a millionare in a Lotus might be just around the corner.

My issue is that there are so many  superior movies of the ""happily ever after"" genre that you could go your whole life without seeing ""Pretty Woman.""

79038,3,0788821075,"Pretty Woman is a popular and very familiar movie meant for a popular audience, the main attraction being the charisma of its two box-office buffos, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
I always feel a certain sense of interest when anticipating a Richard Gere film.  I know that in some way he will be slick and sleazy (e.g., Breathless (1983), Internal Affairs (1990), etc.) and I can get involved in his contrary nature.  In other words, he won't bore me with a one-dimensional persona.  Here however he is thoughtful, kind, considerate, intelligent--a non-sleazy, gray-suited business man with a wise and fatherly manner.  Perhaps this is Gere's persona for his middle years...
In the case of Julia Roberts, not only is she nice to look at, she is interesting to look at.  It is no accident that her face is one of the silver screen's dominate images from the nineties.  She has a powerfully expression nature and can assume a role as easily as one puts on a coat.  She is striking physically, the huge mouth, the delicate nose, the long limbs...  She is also the quintessence of a woman who can appear ordinary or beautiful according to circumstances.  I have seen her in two PBS productions of Nature.  (Yes, she is a Hollywood star with compassion, or at least one who loves animals.)  In one she is in Borneo with orangutans, and in the other in Mongolia with the descendants of Genghis Khan and the wild horses.  In both cases she throws herself into the dirt and discomfort like a trooper without a hint of the glamour she left thousands of miles behind.  She charms both the children of the nomads and the orangutans.  In fact, one randy orangutan becomes so smitten with her that he starts to put the moves on, and has to be restrained!  In other words she has an equalitarian, democratic, down-to-earth nature which sits well with a popular audience.  She has made so many movies lately (hurriedly as her youth is expiring: she is now over thirty, the age of death for most Hollywood actresses) that I cannot keep up with them, so many that her ranking among the great stars of the screen is still up for grabs as we evaluate her many performances.
Will her role in Pretty Woman help?  Although I found it difficult to swallow her fake bad grammar, the phony lack of sophistication, and the predictability of her golden heart, I thought it marginally plausible that such a striking woman COULD in some strange parallel universe be reduced to hooking in Hollywood.  And I thought she did a creditable job by bringing some originality to a well-worn role.  Certainly I believed in Julia Roberts, the whore, as much as I did in Elisabeth Shue, the whore (from Leaving Las Vegas (1995)).  Had Roberts been portrayed as a drug addict--which of course Hollywood made a stringent point of NOT doing, since they needed Middle America to identify with her in order to sell tickets--I might have bought it.  Most American prostitutes are drug addicts.  That's how most of them they got enslaved into the business in the first place.
So what we have here is a variation on an old Hollywood fantasy: poor, underclass girl, through her natural beauty, lovable nature and good common sense wins the heart of a man of considerable means, thus upgrading her social and economic status, etc.  In others words, this is a woman's fantasy-fulfillment movie all the way.  The real question to be asked, though, is how did the chemistry between the two stars work?  Do Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have anything to be jealous about?  I think not, but judging from the box office success and the fact that they were paired again in Runaway Bride (1999), I am probably wrong.  But see it and judge for yourself.  Despite the clich situation, this is more than a confectioner's diversion because of what it implies, and what we can learn, about the American psyche, circa 1990.",972432000,6,3893,4.710487444608567

79058,5,0788821075,"Okay, can anyone say that they do NOT like ""Pretty Woman""?  I mean, this is ""Pretty Woman"" guys... This is definitly NOT a one star movie here.
I think everyone knows what happens, but I should  explain it anyway for those who have been living under a rock for the past  twenty years. Vivan (Julia Roberts) meets Edward (Richard Gere). She's a  street hooker, he's a multi-millionaire. He picks her up for a one-night  stand. When he finds that he needs a date for a few social events, he asks  her to stay for a week or so for a certain amount of money (Something like  3 thousand or 3 million dollars... I forgot). They end up falling in love.  But like every love story ever made, they hit a speed-bump or two which  causes her to become mad at him and leave, ultimately causing him to create  some extrordany Prince Charming-like plan to win her back. ::Love-stricken  sigh:: Ah, love!
Well, see this movie. It's a definite must-see!",959990400,7,937,4.485207100591716
79059,4,0788821075,I never really looked at this movie until I got it on DVD for my girlfriend.  Nice story and good acting.  The added background info about the production of the movie is cool.,956966400,,175,4.2727272727272725
79060,5,0788821075,"Frankly,any human who dosen't like Pretty Woman has no heart. Belive it or not when this movie was first released in the theaters,I saw it 8 times! Now of course I have it's video,and I watch the movie anytime I am  depressed. I like everything about the movie. Really ,make the effort to see  the movie atleast once in your lifetime. If you don't then you are really  missing something.",956966400,,387,4.5
79061,5,0788821075,"This movie may be practically the same plot that is seen in most love stories, but it has a certain charisma about it that makes it the epitome of all romantic comedies.  The ending is what every girl dreams of finding.  Julia Roberts and Richard Gere give a stellar performance in this movie  which makes it on of my absolute favorites and the movie that all other  romance movies are patterned after.",956793600,,402,4.541666666666667
79062,1,0788821075,"I love 'Pretty Woman'. I love the 'regular' DVD. The '10th Anniversary Special' is not that special.
The movie Pretty Woman was previously released on DVD with the only extra being the Director's Commentary. To  release this as a '10th Anniversary Special' and provide poor extras earned  it one star. If this was the only release of 'Pretty Woman' on DVD I would  rate it three stars. (The DVD can offer so much from a film. It takes alot  of extra effort to earn each star.)
""15 minutes of extra  footage"" refers to the original theatrical release and not the  previously released DVD. Both DVDs are 'Director's cuts'
""Behind the  Scenes"" footage last less than three minutes. The exact length of the  'Pretty Woman' song played in the background. For about thirty seconds they  show a crane moving. For another twenty seconds you see Richard Gere's back  as they move the crane. Richard and Julia interacting ""off  camera"", with no audio of them talking to each other. Gary Marshall  looking through a camera lens. And footage, exactly like the scenes at the  Polo match, taken at a distance. The footage looked like a tourist was  shooting digital quality home video. This is not what I would consider true  'Behind the Scenes' footage.
""Theatrical Trailer"" - Pan and  Scan. Not digital quality. Looks and sounds like it was transfered from a  video cassette.
""Production Featurette"" - Less than four  minutes. Almost like a movie trailer with some comments by Gary Marshall  through out. These are just like the Director's Commentary he provides on  this and the the 'regular' DVD. Julia and Richard each say three sentences  for ten and seven seconds;  respectively. These are by no means  ""interviews""!
""Wild Women Do"" music video- Fantastic!
If this is your first 'Pretty Woman' purchase? BUY IT! - If your buying  it for the extras only? DON'T!",955324800,12,1853,4.84664536741214
79063,4,0788821075,"I just recently purchased the 10th Anniversary edition of Pretty Woman. Of course, I watched it the first night I had it home. Once again I was impressed by the charisma of Roberts and Gere. They are splendid together.  Julia Roberts: a funny, vibrant actress. Her laugh is almost contageous.  The scene when Gere snaps the top of the necklace holder on her hand is  great. Gere: Smug, but likeable. They simply work well together. Other  movies I would reccomend are, ""It Could Happen to You."" This is  also very predictable, but a good movie. Also, ""The Story of Us""  is another good movie. Check them both out.",954633600,2,613,4.62962962962963
79064,4,0788821075,"Garry Marshall is the true star of ""Pretty Woman"", a fact that only comes out if you buy the DVD and listen to his witty and insightful commentary on the side track. Starring Julia Roberts in her  career-inspiring role as Vivian, and a stalwart Richard Gere looking more  handsome than ever as stuffy but approachable Edward, this vehicle made  these two stars shine in the heavens. The trick to their magic was Garry  Marshall's directing, and his philosophy of making the stars look their  very best. And he succeeded. Sure, this movie is predictable and campy, but  buying the storyline isn't required to fully enjoy this charming classic.  Thumbs up to ""Pretty Woman"" on DVD.
DVD owners: make sure you  listen to Garry Marshall's commentary. I guarantee you will be laughing at  some parts, and notice things you never have noticed before!",954028800,15,843,4.880281690140845
79065,1,0788821075,"The first time I saw Pretty Woman, I thought it was great.  When I saw the film again, however I was disapponted.  I noticed it was poorly done and it seemed thrown hurridly together.  There are editing mistakes which are  noticeable, such as the breakfast scene.  The movie is choppy between each  scene, with no continuity.  The dialogues written was also poor.  The only  good part of this movie is the cast- Roberts and Gere are delightful as a  pair.",953251200,4,455,4.575
79066,5,0788821075,"At the beginning of the movie, it is fairly obvious what the outcome of the movie is going to be.  Yet, it is still makes for interesting watching as to how it eventually evolves.  Richard Gere and especially Julia Roberts  turn in stunning performances in this easy to watch movie that will have  you laughing.  The subject matter is not so mindless that it will insult  one's intelligence either.",952560000,,398,4.695652173913044

79068,3,0788821075,"Yes, it's incredibly predictable and far to sweet for it's own good sometimes but were it not for Gere and Roberts onscreen chemistry this could have been a dismal flop or nothing too engaging. Julia Roberts  portrays a girl lost on the wrong side of the Hollywood tracks,  prostituting herself to earn some hard cash. Richard Gere plays the typical  hokie prince charming who sees it fit to lift her out of this pavement  status. While never totally believable it always seems to skirt on issues  that leave it lacking the courage of its true convictions. The director had  pure romantic comedy in mind here, thereby totally disregarding an  underbelly that could have given the film more depth. If you like your  comedy's laced with about as much cuteness and sugary sweetness as a  precosious six year old then your in seventh heaven here else others may  find it a mild, incredibly simplistic way of passing an evening.",950832000,,923,4.784810126582278
79069,5,0788821075,"The 10th anniversary edition has enough to make any person without a DVD player happy (ezcept for the absense of an alternate widescreen edition).  It's a director's cut with about 5 minutes additional footage which  includes more to the sequence when Edward picks up Vivian in the Lotus, a  completely new sequence taking place the night of Richard's day off when  Vivian's unable to find Kit at the Blue Banana before being confronted by  Carlos and his thugs, plus many other small worthy additions.  One of the  new scenes removes a continuity error at one point in which Vivian takes  Edward's shoes off under the tree, before they miraculously appear back on,  by omitting the mistake and replacing it with footage of Richard and Vivian  riding horses.  After the movie they show the full-length theatrical  trailer, followed by a not-so-noteworthy behind the scenes featurette,  followed by the forgotten ""Wild Women Do"" music video by Natalie  Cole.  The tape is definately worth they money, I reccomend it to any fan  of the movie.",950400000,13,1040,4.959302325581396

79073,4,0788821075,"Garry Marshall and company pull off an incredible feat with this movie: a hooker on Hollywood Boulevard steals you heart and everything else in the stunning person of Julia Roberts.  We never really delve in to Julia's  obviously troubled past with much concern, nor do we much care that she  clearly states, with candor, her no-no rules when it comes to making  whoopie.  No, this movie is essentially a delightfully fresh and frothy  fairy tale that just so happens to have a rich, devastatingly handsome --  and loose, winning -- Richard Gere in a state of emotional frigidity, and a  gorgeous, grinning, leggy prostitute who wants (and we are convinced)  deserves a prince to carry her away.  Taken on its own breezy and often  amusing terms, Pretty Woman charms the pants off of you. Look for Jason  Alexander in a pre-Seinfeld turn as a piggish lawyer-type, and Hector  Alizondo in his career-making turn as a Hotel Director that wandered in  from Touched By An Angel.  Grown-up fun, silly, and irresistable.",945993600,16,1014,4.882352941176471

The director's views about his  treatment of the film, behind-the-scene tidbits, and other pre-take  preparations deserve a movie of its own.  His natural wit and fluidity will  make watchers want to look at the scene just described and try to bridge  the original perception of the film with its new breadth.  He should star  in one of his films.",938304000,10,597,4.6
79085,5,0788821075,This movie is one of those movie that touches you.
