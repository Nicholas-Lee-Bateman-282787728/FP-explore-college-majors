Just seeing him with Jack Hanna and  the animals was worth the money. you don't need to think twice about ordering it.",1250467200,,360,3.736842105263158
7837690,3,6303066763,"There's a bit of confusion about this tape because it was re-released in 2001, and the new version omits some of the clips in the 1996 version.  (Who knows why?)

For example, I bought this tape from an Amazon seller, and it was missing the Sam Kinison ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" clip, and also missing the Julio Iglesias clip with Johnny playing Willie Nelson.  Turns out I had bought the re-released version.  So then I bought it again from another seller who had the original version, and all the clips are there.

If you want to make sure to get the complete (original) release of this tape, ask the seller to confirm that the front cover has Johnny wearing a light blue jacket, and not a tan jacket (which the re-released edited version has).",1124496000,17,747,4.544776119402985
7837691,5,6303066763,"I watched three of the collection tapes of Johnny Carson's best comedy moments and I laughed so hard I nearly suffered a headache. The comedy skits he performed are the best and there will be no other person who can match Carson's routines. He is not only the king of late night comedy,he is the founder and architect. Although he is gone,his work still lives on on video. Many up and coming comedians should learn not only how to craft their skills by learning from Carson,but the legends who appeared on his show.",1109548800,4,515,4.548387096774194
