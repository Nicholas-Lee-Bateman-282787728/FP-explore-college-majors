8130219,3,B0007LI1Z8,"This is Volume 2 of the 10 volume Columbia House series of Woody Woodpecker videos.  The cartoons are taken from Walter Lantz' TV show from 1976.  This means that most of the cartoons are missing their original titles and some of them have been edited for time or content.  On the other hand, what you do see is in very good condition.  Here are the contents of this volume: Belle Boys (1953), Broadway Bow Wow [a non-Woody Woodpecker Cartune] (1954), Woody Woodpecker (1941), Ace in the Hole [includes original titles] (1942), The Bandmaster [an Andy Panda Cartune] (1947), Banquet Busters [includes original titles] (1948), The Redwood Sap (1951), Crazy Mixed-Up Pup [a non-Woody Woodpecker Cartune directed by Tex Avery] (1955), Woody's Jalopy [original title The Screwdriver] (1941), Hot Noon (1953), The Flying Turtle [a Foolish Fable] (1953), and Room & Wrath [a Chilly Willy Cartune] (1956).  The edited cartoons are Woody Woodpecker, Crazy Mixed-Up Pup, Woody's Jalopy, Hot Noon and Room & Wrath.

Rounding out the volume are a newsreel narrated by Woody and a few segments with Lantz (these were made for the show).  The length of the video is 105 minutes.",1169251200,,1165,5.005181347150259
