8729963,5,B01478VYIC,"This film will make you think. It is a stage play but don't let that stop you from watching this film. Themes of racism and hatred are explored. This film is different than the usual drama/comedy because it shines a light on issues that affect everyone. How can we fight racism? Why do many men resort to crime? Is it because the system is designed to make it hard for them to make it in the business world? Even highly intelligent men of color face racism in college. These themes are discussed at a party where everyone shares their view. The solution. To fight hatred and racism we must educate ourselves and fight hate with love and decency. Some in the film simply fight hate with more hate and violence. Everyone has to make a choice. Pretty deep themes for movie night. If you want to see a film that will make you think rent this stage play. An author invites his old college friend over and they have a debate regarding racism, hatred and violence in America. The wife overacts but otherwise the cast does a pretty good job. Recommended for fans of moral dramas.",1460160000,,1071,4.469387755102041
8729964,4,B01478VYIC,"Charles Watts (Michael Green) is having a small celebration in his Central West apartment over the Nobel Prize he won for his book ""Eyes of Peace."" We meet his wife Nina (Wendy Joy Franklin) and another couple Eric (Jay Nickerson) and Jennifer (Tracey Newirth). They show us their public pretentious face and I was close to turning off the feature. The next person we meet is a homeless man named Terrance (John Marshall Jones-director) who breaks into their comfort zone as he is an old friend of Charles.

The film grew as it discussed the ""black issues"" of the day while entertaining us with humor and drama in a one room play. It was actually shot on stage in front of a live audience so the sound has an echo...not as crisp as a TP stage production. The twist was expected and often used. The movie seemed to imply there is a great white conspiracy out there to make black people feel inferior which is at the root of all of their problems. On the down side,the film offers no solutions other than to blow up history.

The film goes from entertaining to being preachy as we get to hear the proverbial angry black man rail against the system of oppression. It could have been called ""Eldridge Cleaver's SOUL ON ICE for Dummies"" for a few minutes as JMJ rails, he summarizes the themes and asks people if they are angry at the point of a gun. I honestly didn't feel uncomfortable or angry during the climax scene...and that was what the film should have done.

All in all it was entertaining.",1458345600,,1495,4.488970588235294
