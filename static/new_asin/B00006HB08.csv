1757969,5,B00006HB08,This DVD is great!!  My 1 1/2 year old loves Elmo and this DVD has been watched every day since it arrived 2 weeks ago.  It is a great learning tool concerning X-mas and the various ways it is celebrated.  Her dad & I have even learned some valuable info!!  Kudos to ELMO African dancing for Kwanzaa!!!,1038268800,,302,4.245614035087719
1757970,5,B00006HB08,I rented this video for my kids (2 & 3) last Sunday. They watched it over & over & over. It has been playing in the background every one of their waking hours. I had to return it to the video store on Tues. AM and had to go rushing out to buy it after work on Tuesday beacause I just knew that they would ask for it again on Tuesday night. I was right. It is (as all Sesame Street products) a very educational & high quality product. I would definitely recommend it for young children. It shows different holidays celebrated at this time of year and exposes children to many different cultures.,1037750400,3,594,4.219298245614035

I was excited to order him this Christmas one, thinking he'd really like it. I mean, it's ELMO and CHRISTMAS. Um, not so much. For some reason, this did not hold his attention whatsoever.

No matter what your religion or culture, this is a great video that will teach your children (and even the parents :-) ) a few things about how people celebrate the holidays around the world. While it doesn't (and couldn't possibly) cover all possibilities, it shows what the holidays mean to different people and my daughter finds the DVD so fascinating, she sits through the whole thing - except the dance - hilarious!

She really enjoys the puppet shows, such as the ""play"" that Sesame street characters put on about the ""first Christmas"" and when Elmo was dancing African dances, and the Jingle Bell song part. She watches it again and again. As an adult, I found these parts to be cute too, but I don't understand why they choose to spend so much time on Kwanzaa. If one tries to be international, what about the Asian holidays which are so obviously left out in this program?",1227052800,,569,4.377358490566038

1758377,4,B00006HB08,"Although I generally love Elmo's World DVDs, I found the bias in this one troubling. Why is Kelly Ripa telling people about Kwanzaa? Shouldn't a black host be informing kids about this holiday? Kelly says she has never been to Africa. Well that's helpful. And then we get Kelly's take on Hanukkah, which also seems off. Really, she shouldn't be talking about either holiday.

Don't be fooled, this one's about Christianity and Christmas. This may seem extreme, but I really feel the subtext of this video is ""if you aren't Christian, you are second class and you get a second class holiday."" I expect more from these Sesame St videos, because so many supposedly intelligent people are supposed to be involved in making and approving them.",1181606400,5,738,4.857142857142857

1758399,5,B00006HB08,"""Greetings of ""Happy Holidays!"" can be heard at all times of year throughout the world. Every holiday is a unique cultural tradition with specific origins, meanings, and ritual observances. The holidays that your family celebrates may be different from those of your neighbors and friends, or you may even observe the same holiday differently. To help celebrate some of the diverse cultural traditions that bring joy to the world, Sesame Workshop created the video Elmo's World: Happy Holidays."" - From Sesame Street Workshop

My son has both Elmo Saves Christmas and Elmo's World: Happy Holidays! and the latter DVD is MUCH better. (Harvey Fierstein's role as the Easter Bunny in Elmo Saves Christmas is enough to ruin THAT one for me, let alone everything else...)

This culture-friendly DVD shows kids (and muppets!) celebrating Christmas, Kwanzaa, Chanukah, Ramadan, and even mentions Three Kings Day. I like the fact that this DVD doesn't shy away from the nativity scene and the special birth of a ""great teacher to many"" like in other overly-PC DVDs. (For example, Blue's Clues Big Holiday has Wynona Judd merely saying ""Christmas is a time we celebrate a very special birth""--as if the ""J"" word was as bad as the ""F"" word!)

Yet, it also shows other holiday traditions in a respectful, educational way. A child speaking about celebrating Ramadan says ""Ramadan makes me feel happy, to respect my God and my elders"". The Chanukah segment is a cartoon describing the miracle of the Lights--and Baby Bear and family spin the dreidel.

And Elmo doing a Kwanzaa dance? Crazy, bongo-hitting fun!

Kelly Ripa also makes appearances as the friendly mail carrier; she suits the role well.

This DVD is about an hour long and a *wonderful* holiday tale introducing children to a variety of holiday traditions. Too bad they don't show any Pagan Yule festivals, but I guess that may have been too hard for most to swallow, especially since most think Paganism=Satanism (which couldn't be further from the truth).

A well-written, clever DVD! Highly recommended for small children, especially.",1163980800,7,2087,5.084795321637427

1758402,5,B00006HB08,"I caught a bit of this on tv one day(the part where elmo does the kwanzaa dance) and my then 18 month old absolutely LOVED it and so did I.  I bought the DVD and now regardless of what day it is we HAVE to see happy holidays elmo or my now 2 year old is having a fit.
A great video that gives a wonderful overview of the holidays for all people.",1073692800,3,345,3.7260273972602738
1758403,5,B00006HB08,"My two year old daughter loves this and watches it over and over again.  I think it's a nice way to introduce your child to some of the holidays people celebrate in the winter - Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa.",1073088000,,207,4.447368421052632
1758404,5,B00006HB08,"My son enjoyed this DVD last year and we broke it out again for holiday 2003!  It gives a really nice visit to several cultural winter holidays.  From what I can tell, it is fair to all cultures visited.  The mail lady gets on my nerves but other than that I don't mind hearing this one over and over during the winter  holiday season.",1072656000,4,335,4.1875
1758405,5,B00006HB08,This is such a great way to teach children about the various holidays that come up around Christmas.  It is by far my little guy's favorite video- he loves the music and the dancing!  A must have for the holiday season.,1071705600,,219,4.317073170731708
1758406,5,B00006HB08,"This DVD is great, and my 19 mo. old has been watching it nonstop since we first let him watch it on Thanksgiving day. The Kwanzaa dance in itself is worth the price of admission, with the Noodle family skit close behind!
This DVD manages to introduce the basic essence of three year-end holidays (Christmas, Hannukah and Kwaanza) without invoking any one religion or even mentioning God. (Except for a brief mention by one of the ... kids near the end.) Focus is on, family (and food ;-)). It even pauses to mention other holidays like Ramadan and Three Kings day that are also commonly observed but not the focus of this video.",1038787200,30,629,4.575221238938053
