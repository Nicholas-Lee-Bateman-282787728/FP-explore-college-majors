8284935,1,B001BTZV5I,"The narrator's opening lines set the stage for this film. When he asserts that the Allies first met the Tiger in December 1943 in Tunisia, long after the North African campaign had ended, one is not given much hope for the rest of the program. In fact, most of the program does not not even address the Tiger. It is more of a very basic review of the desert war with some generalizations about the tanks involved like the Crusader and Pz III, with Tiger references dropped in here and there--And not always at an appropriate time. What little combat footage of the Tiger there is comes from the Russian front, not Tunisia. Most shots of the Tiger are from the Bovington tank museum where they have a Tiger set up with side sections of its armor removed. For the program, they had reenactors sit in this tank and pretend to be driving, firing, etc. There are some computer animations as well. Reenactors with a functioning Pz II are shown, although the guy wearing late war camo looked ludicrous in the brief live action scenes they put on. In describing the Tiger's armor they used the Bovington cut-away tank to demonstrate the Tiger's 100 mm of armor, unfortunately, they were talking about the Tiger's hull front which was actually 80mm thick. In short, this video's title is not the primary subject and the content is a little less than mediocre--and that is being generous.",1232150400,22,1378,4.651639344262295
