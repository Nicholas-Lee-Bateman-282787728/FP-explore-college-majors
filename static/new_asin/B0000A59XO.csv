7995875,5,B0000A59XO,I use this 3 times a week. It has had the biggest impact on my weight loss.  The abs toning is just enough. Really boosts energy. I lost 30 lb. and 4 sizes.,1426464000,,156,3.727272727272727
7995876,5,B0000A59XO,"This Richard Simmons tape features five songs, and each song utilizes a different routine to focus on different results.  This tape requires a set of dumbbells.  In his routine, he actually uses two differnt sizes.  The first song ""I'm Ready"" features the warm-up.  In the second song, ""Full Potential"", he uses the lighter weights to build endurance.  In the third song ""Tight"", he uses heavier weights to build strength.  In the fourth section, ""Burning Desire"", he incorporates an abdominal routine.  And lastly, in ""Where There's A Will"" there is the cooldown.  A good workout to use for strengthening and building muscle for a stronger, leaner body and a good workout overall.",1201737600,,681,5.072072072072072
7995877,4,B0000A59XO,"I was skeptical of getting some Richard Simmon's workout tapes.  This one is a good workout...it has an endurance and strength section, plus an ab section.  I like working out to this tape and it isn't a wimpy workout either!",1116720000,4,225,4.6
