5934893,5,B00ERAOAAA,Really love this!!! My kids were already hooked on Masha and the bear so we purchased the dvd. It arrived very quickly and has 18 episodes. They watch it  over and over again. I am really happy with it and would definitely recommend it.,1391126400,,236,4.363636363636363
5934894,5,B00ERAOAAA,"Our 2 year-old chants ""Masha, Masha, Masha"" every morning. She loves these cartoons, and I am thrilled that they are actually pleasant to listen to in the background. The music is really nice, and the stories are wholesome. I'm event learning some Russian, which is a big bonus!",1390867200,,278,4.8125
5934895,5,B00ERAOAAA,My boyfriend and I came across this series through a good friend very active in Russian culture. We loved it from the start! I bought this product for my nieces and they loved it! Great for all ages!,1389657600,6,199,4.2631578947368425
5934896,5,B00ERAOAAA,"Had been watching Masha and the Bear episodes on Utube, in Russian I think, with my 2 y.o. grandson.  He loved these tapes (and so did I), but since he needs help with speech and language, I didn't want to have him continue in a language other than English.  Was thrilled to find an English version of this series.  It completely meets the need and the expectations.  So glad this excellent animated cartoon (wonderful characterization and subtle expression) has been made available in English. Highly recommend.",1383782400,10,512,4.9186046511627906
5934897,5,B00ERAOAAA,"My daughter actually found this cartoon on youtube during this past summer, my reaction, of course was what in the world are you watching. So I sat down beside her and watched it as well, even though it is in Russian, it is still understandable even for my 2-year old. It is a very cute cartoon and I love it as much as my daughter!! I cant wait till this becomes more popular in the U.S.!! Definitely worth the buy, and your package does come with some pretty stamps!!",1383004800,8,469,4.280898876404494
5934898,5,B00ERAOAAA,"We Americans are missing out.  Masha and the Bear is the best DVD I've ever purchased, and it is practically unknown in the USA.  Mail from Moscow is a little slow (though you get some colorful stamps!), so Amazon will tell you truthfully that it will take as much as three weeks to arrive.  Use the time to buy an all-regions DVD player, as the DVD is recorded in PAL format.  It worked with no problem on my all-regions player and also on my computer.

Why is it great?  First, this is a comedy cartoon series done in HD and 3D.  The animation is state of the art, and would be a credit to any country.  Second, you will fall in love with the characters.  Masha is a very young girl living in rural Russia.  Her best friend is her neighbor, a grandfather-like bear. He is retired from the circus, so he can juggle and do tricks, including magic. His house is rustic (think Hobbit, but even more cozy), with a wonderful garden outside with bee hives that are frequently knocked over in the mayhem.  Masha is always inadvertently getting into trouble, but Bear always comes to her rescue (and sometimes vice versa!)

You can choose between Russian and English.  But really it doesn't matter much.  The bear cannot talk so he pantomimes, making the story line easy to follow. There is a good reason to choose Russian.  While the English dubbing is superb, the original voice of Masha is provided by the talented Alina Kukushkina.  Search the name on YouTube to find videos of her singing some of Masha's catchy songs.

Finally, the screenplay is fantastic.  There is maximum imagination and fun.  You get the first 18 episodes they made, so the price for what you get is reasonable.  I heard my almost three year old granddaughter belly laughing while watching an episode, so I sat down beside her and we belly laughed in stereo. Priceless.",1380412800,33,1839,4.565749235474006

5934902,5,B00ERAOAAA,"I cannot say enough good things about this. We came across Masha and the Bear on YouTube. This was the first show my daughter (18 months)actively watches and gets excited when it comes on. She loves the cute songs and Masha but the Bear is her favorite. I love the episodes too and even my husband will sit down and watch a few with us. When you get the DVD, it has an English and Russian option. Masha is the only one who speaks in the videos while the Bear and other animals pantomime. The only negative thing I will mention is that there appears to be a commercial every couple episodes on the DVD (it is in Russian and for a chocolate bar).",1462406400,,644,4.201612903225806

8608647,4,B00ERAOAAA,"Before I start... make sure you have a ""region free DVD player"". This particular DVD is manufactured in the U.K. which uses the PAL format, we here in the States use NTSC format which is a different code and PAL is incompatible with our DVD players. Cute Russian cartoon.  My daughter loves this series so I had to buy the DVD.  I like introducing my daughter to new cultures and heritages.  So we go out of our way to find quality entertainment from other countries for her.  Another recommendation is Studio100's Heidi, it's an amazing animated show, good messages, friendships, lessons learned and it was originally released in Germany.  It's languages are German & English on the DVD sets.  Two more which she loves are ""Dragons"" from the ""How To Train Your Dragon"" franchise as well as ""Mia & Me"".  NOTE:  If you appreciated this review please give it a thumbs up/like your helping me to continue to give honest/unbiased insight into products Ive used and you may have questions about.  Interested in a product but don't know enough about it and would like it reviewed?  Please let me know and I'll see what I can do... Thank you ",1522627200,,1135,4.653266331658291
