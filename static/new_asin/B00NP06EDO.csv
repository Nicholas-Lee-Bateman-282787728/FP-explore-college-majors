6674224,5,B00NP06EDO,"I really like this series. Sure it is a hit or miss show with people, but if you have made it this far you are probably hooked. Season II is where the series really picked up for me. Season II felt like the whole thing was relevant. A problem I had with season 1 was that many of the arcs were drawn out mainly the first which sets up the story and the vampire arc which is forgotten more than Himegami Aisa. Season II seems to have fixed that pacing for the most part. So if you were on the fence after watching season 1 just know II is much better.",1421107200,2,550,3.963963963963964

6674226,5,B00NP06EDO,"This is more a review for the second half of the show contained within, not the product itself

I am going to assume that if you are reading this that you have already seen the rest of Index up to this point, so be warned.

Season 2 Part 2 starts off with the conclusion of the ""Croce Di Pierto"" arc, which provides some quite solid plot progression in my opinion and is over all very nice. We then transition into what I like to call the ""Fan Service Extreme"" arc of the show. If I recall correctly, then this is an adaptation of a side story and I would say it's not worth your time. If you are looking for T&A then by all mean indulge yourself, if not, then please proceed to episode 17 where the story resumes.

About now, you are probably asking yourself why I rated this product five stars when I rated the first half four, it seems like I got the same amount of enjoyment out of it, what gives?

It is because of the utterly mind blowing final arc that starts from episode 17 and follows through to the end of the season. Honestly, this arc is what makes Index the most orgasmic piece of anime this side of Puella Magi Madoka Magica (If you haven't seen Madoka, check it out. It might seem girly and childish but watch through the end of episode three before making a judgement)

That shameless plug out of the way, I will conclude by saying that if you stopped watching index at any point prior to this release then I recommend you suffer through it in order to see the final arc. You will be glad that you did, I know I was.

9.5/10, would vector transform again",1418083200,2,1571,4.22

6674240,3,B00NP06EDO,"My comment on this series. Paint dries pretty fast its like 8 hours, and you can get a different appeal to your house. This show however tries to redo the series from another perspective. Take for example the play ""It's the best time of our lives."" apply the principle of that author's work to an entire series. That pretty much seems to be the summary of the show. Except it doesn't work like that particular play because you are not in another perspective you are watching another perspective with another view. It's like watching^2?",1426896000,,535,4.702127659574468
