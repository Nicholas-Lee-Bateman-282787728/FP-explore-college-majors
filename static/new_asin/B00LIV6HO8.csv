6488089,4,B00LIV6HO8,"Simple Minds were referenced by fans and critics as mainstream live act in the early 80's, in the same breath as their Celtic Irish equivalent U2. This made them a strong cult band, and took them to be a favourite `leading' live act for many European summer music festivals like the Belgium Torhout-Werchter and the Dutch Pinkpop, before their commercial breakthrough in '85 with their - not written by themselves - Don't You hit (which is represented here on this DVD). Since Don't You, they became a different kind of band.

This review is written from purchasing the deluxe DVD set, not the Blu Ray but the one with the bonus interviews purchased from Simplemindsshop.com

Their classic sound stems from the keyboards, played by Michael MacNeil, who was the creative brain behind their music. Michael was one of the pioneers in experimenting in the early 80's with synthesisers making modern source of sounds and `musical landscapes' (inspired by new wavers Kraftwerk, Neu and Can). Guitarist Charlie Burchill added bits & bops and the odd riff, and the rhythm section drummer Brian McGee & bass man Derek Forbes added a powerful dance beat to the music. Brian often did the unorthodox off-beat rhythm part to complement the regular synthesized beat-loops from Michael. Good examples are I Travel and This Fear Of Gods (both from their 1980's Empires and Dance album), both of which are included in the live set of this DVD. Their signature album is the double set from 1981: Sons and Fascination & Sister Feelings Call, which are represented by the powerful dance beats from Love Song, The American and the instrumental Theme For Great Cites, all of which played in this DVD - typical very early 80's atmospheric. Their masterpiece album is the highly acclaimed New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84), a real 80's classic (from 1982) which is represented here by the title track, Promised You A Miracle, Hunter And The Hunted, Someone Somewhere in Summertime and (a personal favourite) Glittering Prize.

Brian McGee got replaced, eventually, by powerhouse drummer Mel Gaynor during the recordings of New Gold Dream, who has a distinctive different style (more straight forward heavy rock), then Brian but has become faithful with the band (apart from a few departures) ever since - he's behind the drum kit here, and is responsible for the powerful rocky 1984 Sparkle In The Rain album. Waterfront from that album has become the Simple Minds anthem, and a favourite opener for every live show since. Of course, this DVD starts off with that song. The encore of this DVD has a glimpse with another song from Sparkle, namely Speed Your Love To Me. It's only a glimpse of it though, because it's an experiment from keyboard player Andy Gillespie, playing the chords with a 90-`s dance-like loop, and Charlie having a go with the guitar riff of it, for about two minutes - shame they didn't kick that off with a full version.

Bass man Derek was fired shortly after they recorded Don't You, and Simple Minds have had a few other bass players over the years. After Don't you, they had to do a more commercially focussed album, just so to maintain their credibility for their own sake and confidence after the massive Don't You hit - fuelled by their hunger for success, world-wide recognition and fame, and they did deliver with the 1985 album: Once Upon A Time. They play the title track here, Sanctify Yourself, All The Things She Said, and their hit Alive And Kicking. What makes that album really work well are the duets of Jim, with US power voice, soul singer Robyn Clark (the lady singer who appears in the video of Alive And Kicking). She toured with Simple Minds during their 1985-86 world tour (which is when I saw them live for the first time), and often had Jim gasping for breath on stage. Robyn isn't on this DVD, but in-stead they have Sarah Brown, who doesn't have the power as Robyn, but she does deliver in re-vitalising those hit songs.

1989 got Simple Minds in becoming a stadium rock act, with their Streetfighting Year album, which is represented here with their song Mandela Day. Michael left the band in the early 90's, and so of the original band, only guitarist Charlie Burchill and singer front man and leader Jim Kerr are left. The 1991 album Real Life followed the falling out with Michael, and so they were clearly struggling with their confidence. Not exactly a favourite for the old fans, but the song See The Lights isn't bad, which is played here. Quite a few years later, they did the 1995 Good News From The Next World album, with which they were getting back to their classic sounds from their Sons And Fascination era; this DVD has no song from that album.

After a few more episodes of their history (including quite a few line-up changes in personnel), they pretty much revitalised themselves now with Glaswegian keyboard player Andy Gillespie and bass man (from Aberdeen) Ged Grimes, both of which are quite respectful with the classic Simple Minds sounds of Michael and Derek. They did the 5x5 set (5 songs from their first 5 albums), by which they rediscovered the power of their old work, and it did revitalise them quite positively.

So their power surfaces when you see them play live, as I said before. Well, this DVD definitely represents that. They are not the original band anymore from their creative peak glory days (i.e. from before Don't You), but their enthusiasm has always been infectious, and one thing comes along with that in their particular case, which is in my opinion the reason why they haven't made it to the Dinosaur rock status that U2 have gained: Jim's lyrics don't actually come across to make much sense - they are hard to understand. Jim has a very good sense of melody, but when you read the lyrics for Love Song for example, WTF is he on about?? A second thing that comes along when you see Jim sing live with his band, is that he is the biggest offender I know of being totally nonchalant with his lyrics as well as his melody lines in singing his songs. It almost makes me more and more convinced, that with their 1987 live double album In The City Of Light: it sound so slick, they must have done quite a few overdubs in the mix, for Jim to re-sing his songs in a studio, something they couldn't do here.

However, this DVD is still a pleasure to watch and enjoy, if you are a big fan, if you know the songs well, if you have the gear at home to play it LOUD - I do have a 5.1 hifi home cinema set with projector and screen, so I can convert my home lounge in a concert hall is a matter of a minute - and that's when this DVD really works! Like I said, old faithful Mel Gaynor is at the drums, and he does Brian McGee's thing on for instance Theme For Great Cities quite accurately - not as much though on This Fear Of Gods. New Gold Dream rocks! Andy Gillespie really gets it how important and focal the keyboards are in Simple Minds music and Ged really plucks his bass well.

Fun for sure!!",1412985600,3,6962,4.621665319320938
6488090,5,B00LIV6HO8,"Simple Minds has always been an excellent live band and this show proves they haven't lost their edge over the years. Video and audio quality are great, as is the setlist. The direction does not suffer from the rapid cuts that mar so many concert films. The energy is in the performance, and the director captures it well. Some reviews that I've read elsewhere indicate that this disc is ""Region B."" It played just fine on my ""Region A"" player. Since the packaging makes no mention of regions, I'm guessing it is region free. There is no bonus material on the disc, but I'm not complaining. The performance is well worth the price.",1412899200,8,631,4.592920353982301
