8414150,4,B00435TOQE,"This was a good collection of Michael Jackson information, but it does not show anything new that many Michael Jackson fans have not seen already. It was nice to revisit the Michael Jackson footage I have already seen in the past, but was not worth the money I spent. If you are a true Michael Jackson fan and collector, you might enjoy this in your own collection, otherwise you might regret your purchase. R.I.P. Michael. You were truly the greatest performer and one of the greatest human beings this planet has ever seen.",1315094400,4,525,4.655913978494624

8414152,5,B00435TOQE,This 3 disk dvd set was a nice variety on the icon we loved. The first disk is about Michaels later years and how the celibrity lifestyle put tremendous pressure on him. The second disk is interviews given by Michael himself. I really enjoyed that. The last disk had a really cool interactive disk with trivia test questions about MJ and his life. A must for any true MJ fan.,1310342400,4,375,4.371428571428571
