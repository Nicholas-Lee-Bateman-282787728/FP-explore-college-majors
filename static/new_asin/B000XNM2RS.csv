8228777,5,B000XNM2RS,"I have watched this blackbeard pirate (Robert newton) since I was a Kid in the seventies.  This is the all time Best BlackBeard ever! His actions and words when comunicating with his shipmates is funny and exiting ! He walks and talks like a pirate should be ! His  evil eye he gives when he is thinking about doing something terrible makes you believe your there with them ! Watch or buy this movie, you will never regret it ! all thumbs up !",1204848000,4,443,4.261904761904762
