4309901,5,B004AJYHPG,"Probably the best of the three Unicorn ova's released so far.  This episode not only features some very well animated battle sequences, but also goes deeper into the characters and the factions, specifically the Sleeves.  If you are a Gundam fan this is a must-watch.",1308787200,,267,4.911111111111111
4309902,5,B004AJYHPG,"Following up episode 1 of this new UC based Gundam OVA series, we finally get to see the Unicorn Gundam in action as it squares off in not one but two fights in the ep.  Further plot points unfold as we get to meet Full Front, aka the Ghost of Char and more of the mysteries of LaPlace's Box are unraveled.  This series continues the same high production values as the first with gorgeous film quality animation and full orchestral symphonic score.  They could easily recut the existing eps into a feature film and it would look great on the big screen.  A must buy if you already have ep 1, but if you own ep 1 already, you'd have already bought this anyway.

For a solid and comprehensive fan review of the Gundam Unicorn series, check out the anime mecha podcast Gundam! @ MAHQ with SBR & the Crew, you won't regret it.",1305590400,,822,4.311688311688312
4309903,5,B004AJYHPG,"Its nice to get stuff same day or close to it as Japan, but $50/60 for one hour long episode?  I'm sure the Japanese distributor requested it, but at that price retail it might have been better to not take the deal.

Few months later and it appears this is the new game plan for Bandai in the US.  Seeing as they find region A (US and Japan) blu rays are being imported into Japan at a significantly lower cost then their own, they are cutting off most US licensing and putting English subs on the original Japanese discs with the expectation that they will be the sole source of at least their high end titles.",1299888000,4,611,4.25
4309904,5,B004AJYHPG,This product is more than I expected from this series. And the delivery was quicker than I expected as well. Great purchase.,1298505600,2,124,4.681818181818182
4309905,5,B004AJYHPG,"Well I have to say that episode 2 of Gundam Unicorn is much better than episode 1, at least in my opinion. We finally get to see the Unicorn Gundam in battle, as well as the Char look-a-like Full Frontal, and I must say that whoever created that scene did not disappoint. I was quite amused when the Sinaju kicked the Unicorn in a manner reminiscent of Char's Zaku kicking Amuro's Gundam from the original series. Aside from that one moment, the battles remind me more of Gundam 00. Its very clear allowing you to see the movements in detail.

Of course its not all battles, there is some serious character development as the episode basically outlines the motivations for the Zeon and Federation faction. There are also hints at the past of Banagher which has led me to an interesting theory. He also displays characteristics common of Gundam protagonists, he willingly pilots a mobile suit (with surprising talent) in order to protect something (in this case Audrey Burn AKA Mineva Zabi) however he doesn't want to kill and in fact becomes quite upset when he discovers that he did in fact kill someone accidentally. And of course it would not be a Universal Century Gundam series if at some point the protagonist didn't ask about why adults had to drag others into their wars.

Overall I highly recommend this for any Gundam fan.",1290988800,15,1332,4.688034188034188
8420368,5,B004AJYHPG,awesome,1463616000,,7,7.0
8420369,1,B004AJYHPG,I was hesitant at getting this because of its price but I went ahead and got it...only to find out the f***ing case DID NOT have the f***ing disc itself,1459728000,,152,4.1
8420370,5,B004AJYHPG,I'm a huge Unicorn fan. Getting this series made getting a Bluray player worth it. In fact its the reason I bought a blu ray player in the first place.,1367539200,,151,4.066666666666666
8420371,5,B004AJYHPG,very excellent and worth the money i paid for it. i cant recommend buying this above $50 but its hard to find these at good prices now since bandai-entertainment is no longer existing. this iteration of gundam is one of the best if not the best and all fans should flock to buy this.,1362096000,,283,4.2592592592592595
8420372,5,B004AJYHPG,"The crisp and appealing visuals are excellent, but the sound design on this movie is equally fantastic. Events in this installment of the series moves the story along but is not quite as awe-inspiring as the first, but the quality of the production is to be marveled.",1357257600,,267,4.702127659574468
8420373,5,B004AJYHPG,One of the best ova's I hace seen since Macross plus. The art is problary the best I have seen. With the use of cell shading of the CGI effects make for a commplete and well rounded adventure. 5 out of 5.,1356134400,,204,3.880952380952381
8420374,5,B004AJYHPG,"The show is doing so well and has been so popular it has been extended to a 7th episode, which is long for an OVA but well worth it in this case. The artwork is great as is the audio, I wish I had every gin dam series in this quality to hear on my home theater. The storyline confirms what has always seemed the case in the UC timeline of gundam; which is that both sides are wrong, both sides are right, and no one ever winds in a war. It's closest to zeta gundam, and the lead character Banagher is reminiscent of Kamille. Much how Kamille fought both the federation and Zeon Banagher fights for both of them and neither of them; he only fights for what is right and to protect people. Great series don't hesitate just buy it.",1338940800,,728,4.133802816901408
8420375,2,B004AJYHPG,"when I bought Volume 2 blueray of UC gundam, I was expecting to contiune from where the volume 1 DVD left off from.  I was wrong.  the DVD has both the first and the second episode.  Volume two blueray is just episode 2.

My recomendation is do not buy this if you alreay own Volume one DVD of UC gundam.

That is all.",1326240000,,318,3.984126984126984
8420376,5,B004AJYHPG,"best gundam so far, seems like animation technique and action sequence done by japan animators who were behind ghost in the shell, cowboy bebop and gundam star dust memory, complex story and excellent english voice acting, I especially love Marida Cruz's voice dub (Tara Platt).

BUT....

you sellers at amazon are out of your mind selling this series at $100 per disc, u.s. dollars! You must think most of us Anime fans are idiots and not web savvy, or that we don't know that there is a thing such as Bandai Entertainment web site store. They are selling everything under $50.

You guys selling stuff at Amazon is suppose to present better value or price than original sellers,

ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS? good for you, way to go building the poor image that the public have on merchants as greedy people.

Common guys! be a good Amazon citizen! Do the right thing and sell these titles at the right price. Yeah, some idiots will fall for your trap, until they read my comment here!!! Don't try to drown my post here with another hundred fake reviews, I will re-post.",1324684800,3,1063,4.632978723404255
8420377,5,B004AJYHPG,"episode 2, of course was better than episode 1. Episode 1 is always a intro not like the old gundam series were there is fighting right off the bat. I believe they started making all gundam series like that since Gundam Seed (my fav.). Gundam 00 was half fighting but had to introduce many gundams at once so was understandable. The ending seen is ALWAYS THE SAME NOW, unicorn gundam starts to move...so end of episode.... strike gundam starts to move, so end of episode. But now you have a explosion of FIGHTING!!!!! which is amazing in this episode and doesnt let up in the third either. IM READY FOR THE RELEASE OF EPISODE 4. DECEMBER 4, 2011!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to many exclamations? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1318118400,,754,5.188524590163935
