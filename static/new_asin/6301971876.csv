Walker,(Marvin) is gunned down by his partner and walker's adultrous wife after a sucsesful heist. Two years later Walker returns stalking the steets of Los Angles looking to get his revenge. Lee Marvin is unforgeatable in a amazing performance  with a steel hard cold look in his eyes Walker kills without remorse all that he cares for is his money. In one of the best crime thrillers ever made
the director takes the viewer on a journey through a tourtured human soul who is so bent on revenge & violence that he fails to realize that socitey no longer condems ""eye for an eye"" tactics.

400541,3,6301971876,"Sometimes film reviewers get caught up in their excitement over something new or something old. At the time of its 1967 release, Point Blank was very different. It had a driven, bad man anti-hero. There was toss away violence (extreme for the time). There were really no nice people in the film at all: just a moody, existential environment for a country that had lost a popular president to an assassin's bullet as well as civil unrest because of the Vietnam War. But, looking coldly at the film now, it is very slow, rather overdone with stylish shots, and fairly crude with regard to characters that seem to occupy Hawaii/50 suits and Jackie Kennedy makeup. It's not that I don't like this film. It simply does not hold up next to several others around its time, including Bullit, Targets, The Laughing Policeman, and even some of the Dirty Harry movies. Look at the newest breed (The Usual Suspects, Report to the Commissioner [vastly under-rated film], The General [a great Boorman film], Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction) and the difference is clear. This may be a serious landmark of sorts, but not a great film.",981936000,8,1119,4.77319587628866

He's out for revenge because he's been betrayed by his BEST FRIEND and HIS WIFE. LOOK OUT! But there is much to admire and enjoy in all the bit parts, and especially the recurring images of glass, and cleanliness in this all too alien urban landscape. The one act of human tenderness by our anti-hero is committed in an apartment which has been completely trashed.

This is not just a revenge picture, like so many think, this story is taking place in the mind of a betrayed and dying crook. And what makes the film 'noirer' than most is the fact that our anti-hero is unsuccessful and duped even in his dreams! Now that's noir! If possible, wait to see this in widescreen. The director John Boorman uses it as well as it can be used. Enjoy.",969667200,3,571,4.836734693877551
400544,4,6301971876,"I saw this film after I saw its 90's remake (Payback) and I was amazed at how modern the original was. It's a more 90's movie than it's remake is. Payback is far more straight-forward and mainstream while point blank is  far more interesting. They are both great entertainments in their own way  but I favor Point Blank because of its darker tone and great performances.  The opening scene is also far greater than the remake, (Payback takes away  the entire Alcatraz scene) Flashbacks are a big thing in the 90's and  you'll be suprized to find many more flashbacks in the 60's version than  the 90's version.

400672,5,6301971876,"Made in 1967 by director John Boorman, POINT BLANK seems to be a very dark film made during the experimental period of the late 1960s. It's editing is quite stylish, telling a time fractured story intertwined with memories of its main character (Walker), as he seeks revenge on a man that left him stranded during an illegal money payoff. Filled with scenes of violence and sex, the mood is often tough.

One of my favorite moments in the film takes place in a club where one of the most violent fights in the movie takes place against a movie back screen with the sounds of a screaming singer. It's probably a scene that will stick in the back of your mind for quite some time.

The best part of this film, for me, was the inclusion of Caroll O'Connor. His appearance comes at the end of the film, it's only brief, but highly enjoyable to watch.

The Blu-ray transfer is quite good. This is a Warner release, so you know that quite a bit of effort was put into cleaning up the presentation. Colors are strikingly vivid. There is a good amount of detail in the picture, with the exception of some of the darker scenes. However, it's quite astonishing to see how well the dark scenes look. I can imagine if not for the 1080p transfer, they would look very muddy.

This is just a terrific film that I can see myself watching over and over again. Highly recommended purchase.",1454803200,11,1372,4.4541832669322705

400674,1,6301971876,"Since this film has received such high critical praise I feel obliged to write this review.  Point Blank sucks!  What a disappointment!  The film is based on Richard Stark's first Parker novel The Hunter--a great novel, as are all the ones in the series.  (There are about 24 and I've read the first 7, all wonderful books that I recommend highly).  In Point Blank Parker's name is changed to Walker, played by Lee Marvin.  It starts off with John Vernon jumping on Lee Marvin at a party and knocking him down, all the way practically screaming like the biggest drama king/queen you never want to meet, ""You've got to help me, you've got to help me!""  Marvin is obviously drunk or whatever and is bewildered.  Later on Marvin and Keenan Wynn are riding in a boat around Alcatraz and are discussing how Marvin escaped from there, all the time while a voice is coming over the intercom telling about all the failed escapes from Alcatraz.  The way it's done, with both going on at the same time, is totally annoying.  Then Walker (Marvin) walks through an airport and we hear his shoes clack clacking on the floor.  This goes on for what seems like eternity.  Annoying as hell.  Parker gets to his girlfriend's apartment, shoots up the bed, and then lays down on the couch or bed or flails his arms around for no apparent reason.  Then Sharon Acker, who gives a lousy performance as his girlfriend also flails her arms around.  There is no point in this and it looks totally contrived by the director.  I can see it now:  ""Hey, Lee, flail your arms and roll around. Sharon, you do the same.""  There was not a single scene I saw in the film up to this point--and I'm 30 minutes into the movie now--that was enjoyable or made any sense.  At this point I couldn't take any more and stopped watching.  It's hard to believe so many critics liked this boring, silly and extremely annoying film.  Especially Roger Ebert, who gave it 3 1/2 stars out of 4.  I though he had better taste.",1445990400,,1975,4.48876404494382
400675,5,6301971876,"A revenge thriller with a dream like atmosphere. It can be intepreted as a Ghost Story or some vast fever dream but thst just because John Boormans style is so fresh and unique here. Its a great,cruel beautiful thriller. Highly reccomended.",1445731200,4,240,4.878048780487805

400677,1,6301971876,"Boring...very boring.

When it comes to older movies such films from early 50s to mid 60s there isn't a lot of action in them. What makes them work is their story along with the characters to make it interesting. Point Blank doesn't have any of that.

It's plot is dull, boring, not interesting. Lee Marvin's character Walker is flat, unlikeable and seems to use non-lethal methods against his enemies so I wonder why does he carry a gun when he doesn't even shoot anyone? He has no problem of shooting a bed but won't anyone with it. And speaking of guns a assassin uses a sniper rifle on a bridge with passing cars yet no one stops or notices this assassin.

Hopefully when I get the book ""The Hunter"" by Richard Stark I will enjoy it more then Point Blank",1442880000,,758,4.4
400678,3,6301971876,"This film is directed by the British filmmaker John Boorman of ""Deliverance"" fame.  I saw the film in the theatre when it was first released in 1967 and left me with certain impression.  Finally watched it again on DVD after almost 50 years.
It is primarily a crime and revenge story dressed up with certain directorial flare and ambiguity popular in the late '60s.
Lee Marvin, as usual gave a stoic and strong performance which he was well known of.
Spoiler Alert!
He plays Walker who was betrayed and shot by his trusted friend after a robbery at the abandoned Alcatraz island(of all places).
He recovered and bent on recovering $93,000 that was owed to him and started a killing spree all the way up the (criminal)
organisational chain.
Towards the end, while he was laughed off by one of the crime boss, it also becoming kind of funny for this viewer by Walker's
doggedness(was he shot in the head?) in his relentless quest for his share of the money.
A dated crime drama, a bit pretentious in execution and short on logic.",1441929600,,1027,4.60655737704918

Director John Boorman made a breakout American debut in this one and his use of the techniques of the Nouvelle wave from the French adds to the dream like quality of this classic.  Angie Dickenson has never been more sexy or delectable than in the crime thriller and the Canadian newcomers of John Vernon and Sharon Acker as Marvin's late wife are also excellent plus you can catch a pre-Archie Bunker Carroll O'Connor as one of the kingpins too!!

400853,5,6301971876,"The best thing about this DVD is the commentary soundtrack, which is really more of a recorded conversation between young director Steven Soderbergh and old pro John Boorman. Both directors take you through a detailed analysis of the movie's styles, colors, and set pieces.

Soderbergh cuts to the chase when he says that the events in this movie may be real or they may be a near-death hallucination. He and Boorman both agree, however, that in the final analysis it doesn't matter. Boorman was exploring color and style for their own sake to express and heighten the inner life of main character Walker as played by Lee Marvin. To argue about the ""reality"" of actual events is to miss the point of the movie.

For me, one of the high points of this movie is the staged quality of Walker's conversations with Fairfax as played by Keenan Wynn. You might notice that Wynn's character is very similar to Merlin in Boorman's Excalibur as played by Nicol Williamson. Both characters appear at key moments to reveal information or provide guidance, but never themselves to interfere with events. Boorman confirms on the commentary track that King Arthur legends influenced the way he shaped the scenes between Wynn and Marvin. Like I said, it's an awesome commentary track.

The movie looks great for its age. Colors really pop and details are sharper than sharp. I'll mention that commentary track once again when I say that Boorman and Soderbergh discuss what kind of lenses were used on the movie. Some of the lenses were very new for the time.

The problem with expressionism is that, for all its color and excitement and menace, it's too obscure. Like some of the films of David Lynch, you find yourself--whether Boorman and Soderbergh like it or not--trying to understand just what in the hell is going on in certain scenes of Point Blank. The only way to understand these movies--and the need to understand basic plot events is a healthy and intelligent thing--is to listen to commentary tracks or do some research on your own. I'll say about Point Blank what I say about a lot of expressionistic films: its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. Vivid colors and raw action are exploding from the hidden depths of characters and from the director himself but we can only guess at and surmise their ultimate meanngs.",1419292800,,2328,4.827067669172933

400929,5,6301971876,"I've been a big fan of this movie for many years, long before the advent of DVD let alone Blu-Ray.  I used to go and see it at the repertory cinema often - the first time, I was stunned by the quasi-hallucinatory cinematography of it.  A totally unique film that's never been replicated before or since (although The Limey was a good attempt)

Frankly the story is incidental and not worth summarising or even paying much attention to.  The cinematic style of it is what makes it so riveting both then and now - an excellent psychedelic time-capsule of late `60s LA punctuated by stunning performances from the likes of Marvin, Dickinson and others.

The DVD was a huge let-down when released.  Despite the accolades that it had at the time, it had a ""watery"" non-filmic quality which made it dull and tiresome to watch even once.  Without capturing the garish color and mind-bending trippiness of the film, you were reduced to following the plot which, like I said, is the least interesting aspect of it.

The Blu-Ray is MILES superior to the DVD.  The integrity of every component in this movie that I've discussed above is perfectly captured;  the emotional power of it is all there in bucketloads.  The colors are strong and vivid and in true Blu-ray style you notice subtleties that you hadn't noticed before (e.g. the green chairs in the corporate offices, Angie Dickinson's expression after the ""what's my last name"" exchange).

The overall quality is very filmic (no DNR etc) and good grain where appropriate.  It looks like a strong 35 mm print that has been run a few times but has plenty of life left.  So no Criterion day-it-was-released look but more than satisfactory.  Ideally, I would like Criterion to get hold of this as I think they would clearly be able to make an improvement but this is a minor quibble.

For fans of `60s cinema and experimental film-making, this Blu-Ray edition will thoroughly satisfy.  I no longer feel the need to see this in a movie house anymore unless there's a full restoration of the original 35mm print (which does happen from time to time)",1411689600,9,2089,4.710743801652892
400930,3,6301971876,"Point Blank is Loaded

As Walker, Lee Marvin in Point Blank is a wonderful but one-dimensional villain. He plays a thug who feels cheated of his take in a heist and is determined to get his stolen money. Marvin plays Walker with a kind of laser-like focus combined with unthinking brutality.

The film begins oddly by flashing between scenes of a mass of men in suits getting into odd fights and scenes in a prison we are led to believe is Alcatraz.
The bulk of the film takes place in a nightmarish urban setting. Female characters are divided between sensuous bimbos and aging matrons. But the focus in this moral desert is on the violent greedy men. Most of the major male characters either belong to or are peripheral participants in a Mafia-like Organization. The nasty fellows include Frederick Carter (Lloyd Bochner), Mal Reese (John Vernon), and Brewster (Carroll OConnor).

Walker takes time out to fool around with pretty Chris (Angie Dickinson). There is also some sensuous action with Lynn (Sharon Acker).

Point Blank is a well-crafted action flick. It can be enjoyed by those who do not demand layering in characterization and are not put off by movies depicting a world drained of the milk of human kindness.",1411257600,,1223,4.837320574162679

401013,5,6301971876,"Walker (Lee Marvin) and Mal Reese (John Vernon) stage a robbery, stealing a bag of cash from some crooks conducting a delivery by helicopter in deserted Alcatraz. Reese double crosses Walker and leaves him for dead, taking off with the cash and Walker's wife. Walker survives, escapes from the island, and comes after Reese, and all the rest of his criminal organisation, with the mantra, ""I want my $93,000.""

On this third or fourth viewing, I was struck less by what an exemplary action film this is (Marvin, the hardest man in the history of the movies, was at least as mean and relentless in The Killers), and more by how deeply artiness is infused into its structure and design. The recurrent flashing back and forward in time, especially at the start between the planning - not in the traditional meticulous heist film set up, just a series of fractured, barely linked brief meetings and conversations - and the robbery, but also Walker's thoughts returning to his betrayal, feed the predominant critical interpretation that Walker was fatally wounded on Alcatraz, and the whole film is his trying to process this and his fantasy of revenge. Boorman addresses this directly in the commentary, to the extent that he refuses to commit and says it's intended to be ambiguous. I'm now firmly in the dying-flashback camp, because of Walker's almost magical powers. (On reflection, it's like the question of whether Deckard is a replicant - you can enjoy debating it and looking for clues, but in the end the answer is yes.) He appears in new scenes and locations with no evidence of having travelled, and generally in a spiffy new outfit (more of this later) despite carrying nothing but his revolver, and, particularly in the central sequence, he evades being apprehended either by coincidence (the lift he's in opens and closes while the baddies waiting for the same lift are distracted by a commotion) or by the sheer application of cool (waiting immobile but scarcely invisible in an underground car park while his pursuer is gunned down by police). He also has an advisor/mentor, played by Keenan Wynn, who pops up in scenes like a cartoon character (he looks like a sort of dome shaped, bristle headed man in a suit who might appear in Ren and Stimpy) and gives Walker his next mission, while the two of them assiduously avoid eye contact as if one or both aren't really there.

From Walker's re-emergence in the first of a series of natty suits, Point Blank is constructed as a series of set pieces. The first is the oddest, continuing the flashbacks and playing with chronology. Walker is seen striding intently down a corridor, and we hear the sound of his footsteps over a series of scenes of his meeting his wife, and the two of them sharing innocent good times with Reese. He confronts his wife, fires six shots into her bed before realising Reese isn't there. A scene later, she's dead after an apparent overdose. A scene after that, the body is gone, the apartment is bare, and Walker has boarded himself inside. Did Walker even see his wife? Had she died already? A messenger arrives from whom Walker extracts a name, and he's off chasing the next link.

Walker meets care dealer Big John, whose yard has enormous signs in a jazzy '50s font. He asks for a test drive, buckles his seatbelt, and smashes the car between pillars (c.f. The Driver) until John spills the next name.

The most self-consciously art-directed scene follows, in which Walker visits a nightclub which features both a bikini-clad go-go dancer and a trio playing something between jazz and James Brown. Tipped off by a flirtatious waitress that he's being followed, he ducks behind the stage, and fights two baddies while giant faces are projected on a huge screen behind him. In a moment that suggests Tarantino watched this while writing Inglourious Basterds, Walker pulls down a rack of celluloid canisters to trap one pursuer, and then returns things to some kind of action movie orthodoxy by subduing the other one with a haymaker to the groin.

In the centrepiece, Walker meets his sister-in-law Chris (Angie Dickinson). Grief and his mission of revenge don't mean he misses the chance to share her bed, and emerge, manhood serenely unthreatened, in her borrowed yellow shortie robe. The colour scheme gets turned up to 11 at this stage, with Walker in a mustard shirt-sports jacket combo (his outfits get truly creative whenever he's bedded Angie - later, he sports a shirt somewhere between salmon and ruby grapefruit - which I guess is the wardrobe equivalent of Joseph Gordon Levitt's post-coital dance routine in (500) Days of Summer), Angie in a rockin' yellow shift dress and matching '60s mid-length coat (let down soon after by wearing something striped like a bee), and Reese in a light tan, crushed velour t-shirt that might be the least flattering male garment in cinema until Borat's mankini. Walker even finds a sightseeing telescope painted lemon yellow, which he casually dislocates from its moorings to scope out Reese's penthouse lair.

Once Reese is dealt with, the movie shifts into an early example of crime-as-big-business. Reese's boss is Carter, whose sleek Mad Men-style office and threads are matched by his resemblance to that series' Ted.  According to IMDb, Lloyd Bochner, who plays Carter, was doing voice-over work from age eleven, and between him, Vernon's baritone (you know how it sounds - like Dean Wormer: ""Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.""), and Marvin's basso profundo, there's a meeting of male voices unmatched until, say, Brideshead Revisited.

Around this point the architecture of LA attracts more and more focus, both modernist glass towers and the concrete culvert of the LA River, where a sniper lurks who might have inspired the climactic shooter in Get Carter.

The commentary is conducted as a dialogue between Boorman and Soderbergh, who, if you've seen this, early Nic Roeg (Performance and Don't Look Now), and were already acquainted with the colour yellow, seems less original than he otherwise might. He has the decency to open by talking about how many times he's stolen from Point Blank.

He's not the only one though. Point Blank deconstructs and toys with the action film as knowingly as anything in the 45+ years since, up to and including Archer and the entire oeuvre of Shane Black. Just when it's in danger of becoming too clever to be satisfying as a genre piece, it gets your attention with a pistol whipping, a punch to the groin, or the rarely-shown actual end result of the villain-takes-a-long-fall thing. And of course there's Marvin, who, whether dressed like a dandy, wearing a robe, or looking baffled when the next corporate criminal explains that they just don't have $93,000 to hand over, can't be beat.

401055,5,6301971876,"A terrific late 60s thriller. The story is very simple  a man (Lee Marvin) is betrayed by his wife and best friend who
shoot him and leave him for dead during a robbery they all commit together. Marvin spends the rest of the film
getting revenge, as well as trying to get his $93,000 back.

But where the story itself is simple, Boorman brings a dazzling array of stylistic conceits, many more normally at home in European art films
of the day, than in a Hollywood tough guy revenge story. Echoes of Godard, Bergman, Truffaut, and Antonioni - just to name a few  pull
one to look deeper into this story, the loose, sometimes confusing and elliptical structure leading us inside the character's alienation.

There have been many films starring the 'lone tough guy' but this is one about just how alone and lonely it is to be that guy, and how
pointless being an individualist can seem in a modern world, where even crime is run not by street-tough hoods, but by corporate types in
suits. ""The Organization"" here isn't the Mafia, but might well be any Fortune 500 company, and indeed the film acknowledges the darkly comic
absurdism of Marvin's quest for $93,000 from men to whom that kind of money is chump change.

In that sense it's a beautiful, dream-like study of the old ideal of the loner coming up against a modern world where the loner is no longer
the hero, or even the anti-hero. He's simply, sadly an anachronism.

The WB DVD transfer is really quite good, and is a steal at it's current $5 price, but I'd love to see a great blu-ray update done.",1388361600,2,1556,4.519572953736655

401092,5,6301971876,"With the relentlessness, of Yul Brynner's robot character in Westworld, Walker, in the person of Lee Marvin, spends the entire movie hunting down his prey after being left for dead by his cheating wife and double dealing best friend, Mal (John Vernon).  Ostensibly, his goal is the return of the $93,000 share of the haul stolen from him, along with his wife (Sharon Acker), by Mal following a successful heist that takes place on a lonely, bleak and windswept Alcatraz.  The money belongs to the `organization' and, like an unstoppable virus; Walker invades it with ruthless, violent efficiency.

Released in 1967, and therefore predating the early seventies `paranoia' films of Alan J Pakula such as The Parallax View, All the President's Men and Klute, it, nevertheless, shares, with them, certain characteristic features.  Likewise, Walker, both haunted and haunter, seems a very close relative of the Clint Eastwood `man with no name' character that first came to prominence in Leone's so-called `spaghetti westerns' but reached its apotheosis in High Plains Drifter (1973).

The character of Walker, based on Richard Stark's protagonist, Parker, from his 1962 `noirish' novel, The Hunter, seemed to be created with Marvin in mind; with very few exceptions does an actor embody his film role so completely, one such exception being, possibly, Eastwood's.  With a brilliant, evocative, Johnny Mandel score and the stark Los Angeles architecture as a backdrop Point Blank is the epitome of late 60s existential angst and a brutal counterpoint to the peace and love that inspired the hippies of west coast America's pre-Vietnam dream.

401146,4,6301971876,"To echo someone's observation, there are times in POINT BLANK when Lee Marvin's character, moving with implacable precision, comes off as an early precursor to Schwarzenegger's Terminator. Walker (no first name, please) is relentless as they come, but maybe you would be, too, were you feeding off an almighty grudge. Retribution is coming to Los Angeles.

The film opens with a series of disconcerting flashbacks in which we see Walker and his two accomplices, his gorgeous wife (Sharon Acker) and his good pal Mal Reese (John Vernon), brazenly hijack the mob's weekly scheduled money drop at the abandoned Alcatraz penitentiary. See, it's like this: Mal Reese is desperate to buy his way back into the Organization's good graces and so it's a dilemma when his share of the loot doesn't equate to what he needs. Ergo, the betrayal. Mal Reese repeatedly fires on Walker, takes his share. For good measure, he also takes Walker's wife. So quit wondering why Walker is walking with a vicious hard-0n for his erstwhile best pal.

1967's POINT BLANK is adapted from Richard Stark's novel THE HUNTER, and the most interesting thing about that is probably that ""Richard Stark"" is a pseudonym for Donald E. Westlake. Mel Gibson, before he went insane, did an electrifying remake of POINT BLANK. Except that while&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Payback/dp/B00000JDIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Payback</a>&nbsp;excels as a taut straight-up revenge thriller, it lacks the original's unsettling artistry. POINT BLANK's director, John Boorman, exhibits fine command at the helm; it's obvious that he's been influenced by the 1960s French New Wave film movement. He purposely efs with the viewer's perception thru use of techniques such as jump cuts, repeated flashbacks, dreamlike imagery, and fragmented pacing.

Something else that PAYBACK doesn't much touch on is Boorman's presentation of Walker as a man out of his time. Walker is an old-school tough guy whose upfront brand of brutality is outdated in a modern world in which the big time perps have gentrified and become faceless corporate executives. Except that Walker won't be swayed from collecting the $93,000 owed him. As he casually remarks when a suit and tie hood marvels at his singlemindedness: ""I really want my money.""

Angie Dickinson plays the sister of Walker's unfaithful wife, and she's very good here. She loathes Mal Reese and kind of likes Walker, and so she agrees to act as Walker's bait to catch Reese. There's a powerful scene in the film's second half set in mobster Carrol O'Connor's posh home in which a distraught Dickinson attempts to break thru Marvin's cold, calculating shell. Meanwhile, Keenan Wynn, here bereft of his trademark 'stache, is Walker's other ally, playing an official of some undefined law enforcement agency. He approves of and even abets Walker's inexorable shredding of the Organization's upper management.

Huge chunks of the film take place in Los Angeles, a slick concrete jungle that readily assumes an aura of seediness. In a fatal tug-of-war between a walking anachronism and a bunch of suited-up gunsels gone corporate, it's Walker who's got the most stubborn grip. Bad guys should've just given him his money. And not shot at him. And not taken his wife.",1359849600,,3303,5.307839388145315

401150,3,6301971876,"Compared to the novel on which it is based, this movie is a complete letdown, so fans of the Parker series of novels who are drawn to this book may want to think twice about watching the film if they are looking for a faithful adaptation of the first Parker novel. That being said, it was not the intention of the director John Boorman to adapt Richard Stark's excellent novel, ""the Hunter"" to film, but rather to create an entirely new piece of fiction from the skeleton of the original story, so one most try to judge the movie on its own merits, which is difficult to do.

As in other reviews, I must commend the directing. The style of the film is way ahead of it's time, with stark visuals, stylized fight scenes, and prolonged moments of silence. I love the long Walk lee Marvin takes thru the a multi-colored corridor where his footsteps drown out all other sound. Marvin's performance is also very strong, and he shows himself to have been an actor who took chances with his image and, in this case, used his clout to make a movie which otherwise would not have been so memorable.

In the end, one must ask the question ""Why?"" Why not faithfully adapt ""The Hunter"" into film? It certainly would not have stifled the film's creativity, and nothing in the movie's script was any better than what was in the book. There is also the annoying occurrence of changing the protagonists' name from Parker to something else; in this case, Walker. This trend continued in another six film adaptations of the Parker novels, the last of which was 1999's Payback, starring Mel Gibson as Porter.",1309392000,,1588,4.568421052631579

For those unenlightened souls who downplay Marvins career this was the one that to my mind surpassed most of his prior efforts with the exception of the Killers which was above par in all respects. Marvin was ahead of the pack in the 60s playing this type of hard nosed no nonsense gangster type, no other actor came close and type casted him to some extent in this type of role which unlike may actors became a positive in his career. Just to show his brilliance as an actor he gave us later comedy roles which produced more acting accolades than that material for which he was better known namely what we see in Point Blank. He carries the whole movie as did all the great actors of that era and many since which in itself is the hallmark of greatness. Marvin was a man who so perfectly personified the parts he was playing that often other actors looked wooden in comparison. He was one of the rare individuals who could take a small co starring role and end up being the star of the movie, no mean feat when you were up against the best in the business at that time and there were plenty in the 60 and 70s. To my mind Point Blank will always be a MARVIN film and this is not to downplay other good workmanlike performances in the film but it will always rank highly in Marvins body of work which is a cut above his contemporaries in the roles for which he was known and appreciated. As for the film it played out in fairly predictable fashion until the  final scenes under the golden gate brige which gave a nice twist and left the viewer unsure whether Walker did in fact take his money or simply leave the scene of the set up empty handed. The obvious answer is that he waited till the coast was clear and took his money. It is hard to accept that he did otherwise.

401195,5,6301971876,"""Point Blank"" is one of the most fascinating films to ever emerge from the 1960s. It's a classic, though granted an acquired taste, that will leave many film-going novices scratching their heads. I understand why some viewers have difficulty ""getting"" this 1967 work. It's a stark, bare as bone, minimalist revenge film with hip style to spare. It's experimental and brutal, with an uncompromising conclusion that will leave you questioning all that came before.

Directed by John Boorman early in his career (this was his second film, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hell-in-the-Pacific/dp/B0001GF2FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hell in the Pacific</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deliverance/dp/6305558159/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deliverance</a>&nbsp;still to come), it's an American produced, French New Wave-inspired, psychedelic, dream-like thriller sculpted by a youthful British craftsman. Throw into this spicy brew a hungover Lee Marvin with an edge as sharp as a flint arrow, and you have the always challenging ""Point Blank."" British film critics recently called this one of the 100 greatest films ever made and, you know, they're not far from the truth.

The story's fairly basic, as Marvin is double-crossed by his wife and best friend and left for dead on Alcatraz, of all places. The abandoned prison, closed in 1963, makes a nice locale for money drops. Slugs in his gut, somehow Marvin survives, rising from the ashes like a demonic Phoenix, stylish shoes loudly clacking down an endless hallway in search of prey. With grim determination, hate pumping through his veins, he circles his marks like a scythe-carrying specter. Not only does he wish revenge, he wants his money, in this case $93,000 owed him from the heist. This must be scissored from the talons of ""The Organization,"" a thinly veiled Hollywood version of the Mafia, with gangsters adorned in stylish suits, flying to and fro on private jets, comfortably reclining on leather chairs in penthouse suites.

Marvin, at the peak of menace (his two prior films were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Professionals-Special-Edition/dp/B0007MAO0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Professionals (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dirty-Dozen/dp/B0007TKNM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dirty Dozen</a>), wades into the goons like a razor through hot butter. As Walker, oozing hostility and cynicism, he carves a trademark performance that will be known for as long as we remember him. A tough guy in real life - Marvin was a veteran of the Pacific - he had cut his teeth for years in villainous supporting roles, easily stealing scenes from the likes of John Wayne, Marlon Brando and Spencer Tracy. Standing next to him, these storied giants were milquetoast. You have the disorienting feeling in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Shot-Liberty-Valance/dp/B00005ASGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-One/dp/0767818172/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Day-at-Black-Rock/dp/B0007TKNH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Day at Black Rock</a>, that he could easily pummel his better known co-stars if not for that irritating script. There was an uncomfortably evil spark in his eyes - part white trash and wolverine killer - that bubbled to the surface like scalding coffee served black (yes, a reference to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Heat/dp/B00005RDRL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Heat</a>). I think the fury was real, lacking in pretension, and never has a film fit an actor more comfortably.

He has great support from John Vernon (in his debut role) as the back-stabbing best friend, and the lovely Angie Dickinson, at the height of her considerable allure, as his sister-in-law. They have an enraged scene together, one of the most memorable in history, where she assaults him. Marvin dodges a few blows, but takes the brunt and rarely flinches. After roughly a minute, Angie drops to the floor in exhaustion, and they eventually fall into bed. It's one of the first moments in film history where a psychological connection is made between sex and violence, something&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bonnie-and-Clyde/dp/B00000ING1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bonnie and Clyde</a>&nbsp;has been given credit for, though ironically both films were released the same month.

I could go on, noting the hilarious scenes between Marvin and Carroll O'Connor, Marvin throwing a naked man over a balcony followed by the shot of teenage girls staring in disbelief, the peculiar flashback when Marvin meets his wife, surrounded by what appears to be a pack of aroused friends. Unlike its remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Payback/dp/B00000JDIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Payback</a>, a vastly inferior film though with a fine performance by Mel Gibson, there's not a single predictable moment in ""Point Blank."" There's a rebellious creativity, combined with dadaist editing and neo-noir choreography. ""Point Break"" is unlike any action film ever seen before. Rarely has such a by-the-numbers screenplay been told with such an artistic eye, owing much to the experimental decade it was made. It's telling that after 40-plus years, ""Point Blank"" is still discussed and, most importantly, it's still very, very cool. Lee Marvin's greatest film, which says a lot.",1270944000,10,5858,6.68241469816273
401196,2,6301971876,"Point Blank (1967) is not to be confused with 1991s ""Point Break"" (the surfer crime drama with Patrick Swayze) or 1997s ""Gross Point Blank"" (the dark comedy with John Cusack). ""Point Blank"" is a 1967 crime/revenge drama starring Lee Marvin and Angie Dickinson.

Lee Marvin was at the top of his career in 1967. He just won the Oscar for his 20th film, ""Cat Ballou"" (1965), and the same year as ""Point Blank"" he appeared in ""The Professionals"" and ""The Dirty Dozen"", and he'd already done a terrific job in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962). While he had more than a dozen films to make before his death in 1987, nothing he would do in the future would be as productive as this year. Marvin's role in ""Point Blank"" resembles the character he played in Don Siegel's ""The Killers"" (1964). Marvin's performance is probably the best thing about this film.

This was Angie Dickinson's 29th film. She had appeared with Marvin in ""The Killers"" (1964), with Marlon Brando in ""The Chase"" (1966), with Frank Sinatra in ""Ocean's Eleven"" (1960), and with John Wayne in ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). Perhaps her most memorable film role was in ""Dressed to Kill"" (1980), and she is probably best known for her TV series ""Police Woman"" (1974 - 1978) for which she was nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe 3 times. She won the Golden Globe in 1960 (Most Promising Newcomer) and 1975 (""Police Woman"").

The film features John Vernon, Keenan Wynn, Carroll O'Connor, Lloyd Bochner, and Michael Strong. James Sikking makes a very brief appearance as an assassin.

- John Vernon gave us many memorable performances, often playing opposite Clint Eastwood as the Mayor in ""Dirty Harry"" (1971) and Fletcher in ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976). Contrary to popular belief, ""Point Blank"" was not his film debut (his first film was ""The Harvest"" in 1957). He's best remembered as Dean Wormer from ""Animal House"" (1978).

- Keenan Wynn was the son of comedy genius Ed Wynn. He appeared in nearly 100 films and as many TV shows. He worked with Angie Dickinson on ""Police Woman"" and received an Emmy nomination in 1978. Wynn sleep walks through the film, giving the character none of the edginess he deserves.

- Carroll O'Connor is best known to us as from his TV roles as Archie Bunker from ""All in the Family"" (1971 - 1979) and the Police Chief from ""In the Heat of the Night"" - he won Emmys for both roles.  O'Connor plays the mob chief as a bit of a bumbler, which is hardly believable.

""Point Blank"" was John Boorman's third film as a director, a job he got due to his relationship with Lee Marvin.  His best known film is ""Deliverance"" (1972) for which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director and Best Picture. He lost to ""The Godfather"" (Picture) and Bob Fosse (""Cabaret""). He was nominated again in 1988 for ""Hope and Glory"", losing to ""The Last Emperor"". He won Best Director at Cannes for ""The General"" (1998). Among his other memorable films are ""Excalibur"" (1981) and Zardoz (1974).

Looking back at ""Point Blank"", it appears relatively mild by today's standards. Therefore, one has to consider the film with respect to the late 60s when it was produced. Here's a list of some of the major films of 1967 - ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""In Cold Blood"". So 1967 was hardly a ""kindler and gentler"" movie season. How then can you explain the muted violence in a film called ""Point Blank""? For example, Marvin dispatches most of his opponents with fistacuffs and then ties them up. Sometimes he merely talks them into tying themselves up. He does manage to shoot a few, but it's only in self defense. His lifelong enemy, Reese, is killed by accident when he falls off the building. The next major figure to be dispatched is killed by his own assassin, and the third Mr. Big from the organization is killed by another mob figure. Hardly the track record for a major killer.

""Point Blank"" has all the marking of a film noir, but never quite crosses that line. We have the sleazy side of life, in the dark city, peopled by all sorts of misanthropes, double crosses galore, with lots of dark scenes and even a little rain. But what we're missing is the femme fatale and the obligatory downbeat ending.

There are even more problems with the film. The flashback sequences are jarring, which may be the director's intent, but it doesn't necessarily make for good film. The jazzy music is equally jarring which begins to give the look of a B film or a student film. Of course, as a young director, this may be exactly what is happening.

Roger Ebert gave it a mere 3 stars, but it was highly regarded by some critics who saw the blend of new wave and film noir as exciting and unusual. If you like the new wave films of the 60s and 70s you'll probably enjoy ""Point Blank"" If you're looking for the conventional crime/revenge drama, or film noir, you need to go elsewhere. BTW - the film was remade as ""Payback"" along the lines of the book, and for traditionalists, is a far better film.",1270425600,5,4995,4.605174353205849

401202,3,6301971876,"In the late 60's, if you wanted an actor to play a tough, mean, angry SOB, you might be hard pressed to find someone better for the role than Lee Marvin.  Directed by John Boorman, Point Blank (1967) features Marvin (The Dirty Dozen), as Walker, a hard boiled criminal with a burning desire for revenge, willing to break in half, anyone that gets in his way.

Walker, his wife Lynne (Sharon Acker), and buddy Mal Reese (John Vernon), are partners in crime.  On Alcatraz island to make a score, Reese decides to end the partnership by putting a couple of slugs into Walker, taking his wife, and his share of the loot (93 thousand dollar$).

A year later, recovered from his wounds, and with the help of a mysterious underworld figure named Yost (Keenan Wynn), Walker is ready for revenge.  Things won't be easy, as Reese knows Walker is coming, and is holed up in a penthouse suite, surrounded by bodyguards.  Walker has enlisted the help of his wife's sister Chris (Angie Dickinson), and uses her to get to Reese.  Things get a bit messy, as Reese loses his balance, and Walker learns that his money has been paid to the Organization.  It's the money that really drives Walker.  Even when Lynne and Reese are no longer in the picture, Walker's desire to reclaim the $93,000, propels him to risk his life taking on the organization.  Under Yost's guiding hand, things ironically finish where they began, as Walker and his cash both end up on Alcatraz.

Point Blank would probably not be regarded today, as particularly violent or shocking, and may now be of interest more for its historical significance, and notable cast.  Lee Marvin, rarely a straight up good guy, makes an appropriate antihero, in what was then, a rather violent statement.  The use of flashback cuts, seems to add ambiguity rather than clarify matters.  Boorman, perhaps most well-known as the director of Deliverance (1972) and The General (1998), would team up with Marvin again in the World War II adventure, Hell in the Pacific (1968).",1253577600,,2009,4.752161383285302

401225,4,6301971876,"POINT BLANK is one of the best cinematic representations of that stark, sun-bleached, urban mood which dominated the mid-to-late-1960s but rarely gets referred to--- people talk about ""protest"" and ""tumult"" yet rarely refer to the almost post-apocalyptic zeitgeist of the era.

The atonal score; the ""echo-y"" resonance of the thing; the claw-your-neck, angsty atmoshpere; the diffused lighting; that window-screen camera trick; the jazz bar; those aloof neon lights at night; even that car lot.... it's all just sooooo very, very 1966/67...

It's just like the metaphorically appropriate name of the film: in-your-face (""POINT"") yet oddly hollow (""BLANK"").

For any younger person looking to see what the cities tended to feel like at that time, POINT BLANK is one of the better movie examples of the period you could point to.

In order to capture that invigorating, counterculture, echo-chamber resonance that made the '60s so poignant and memorable, then you also have to capture (what Walter Cronkite once described correctly as) that ""slum of a decade"" vibe as well.

They're both true: sunlight across an open field, and crud glued into the cracks of an urban sidewalk.

Without one, you miss the irony of the '60s that so defined it.

(Not that all this is perfectly actualized in this movie, necessarily, but you get the idea).

...Also, the DVD has two brief extras (both entitled ""The Rock"") which focus on Alcatraz Prison and also convey the same lost, disillusioned flavor of time which was so captivating yet confounding --- in fact, these two extras show you much MORE of Alcatraz than the movie itself winds up doing, so something must have been left on the cutting room floor.",1249776000,2,1692,5.0830324909747295
401226,3,6301971876,"It always makes me laugh to see a well-written and fairly argued low-star review on this site get all sorts of unhelpful votes, as some of them do for this movie. The votes aren't really against the review: they're for daring to have a dissenting viewpoint. Such a crime! What is wrong with some reviewers; are their egos and self-worth so tied up in their favorite works of (someone else's) art that a viewer who doesn't like it must be showered with scorn for disagreeing with their opinion? Do they see it as a personal attack on their self-worth (such as it is, stemming from others' achievements)? Are their lives so empty that to disagree with them is a crime? Apparently so. How nice to not be living their lives, and to know a boring movie when one sees it.

I just watched this last night having read no reviews etc, going in cold, the best way to see a film in my estimation. And by the end I was quite convinced that the only really good thing about this movie was Lee Marvin.

I've enjoyed some Boorman films and found others corny in their over-reaching, and I think his direction is one of the weakest aspects of Point Blank. The script has fair dialogue but is full of holes; we are never really shown Walker's deepest motivations apart from ""I want my money!"", and the rather pointless ending sort of obviates them anyways. Boorman is so worried about getting the most noir-looking (but not noir-feeling) and ""modern"" camera angles and pans etc that he neglects to deal with all sorts of small and large fissures in the plot and script.

I don't want to notice a camera angle; I want to be transported BY it. The shot is not the end, it's a means to an end: furthering the story and character development. If, as in Coppola and Hitchcock and Truffaut and other greats, the shot is also pure art, excellent. But Boorman wants us to notice the Art Of Boorman more than Marvin or the story or even the wonderful SF locales, and ends up achieving neither.

Marvin is taciturn and believable as always; he usually delivered, and he carries this film all the way. Vernon is good enough as the bad guy (in his first role, and he stayed type-cast in that role for his whole career), but Dickinson and the others here are merely fair (Wynn is good but rarely seen). The oft-silly plot peregrinations do none of them any favors, though, and Boorman's own insistence on being noticed makes it all seem like a failed movie-student effort by the end.

I couldn't ever really enter the world of this film, despite it being set in one of my favorite towns, in an era when that town was ripe for great cinematography. Even Alcatraz seemed misused, and how exactly can bad guys fly a chopper in there weekly without the cops noticing? That's only one of many plot holes that Boorman left in place...and yet this is a five star movie? I don't think so.

I think some reviewers just want to feel that they have found some old gem in this and other semi-b-movies with pretensions to greatness, and it becomes their pet. How dare you give my secret discovery a bad rating?! I will unhelpful you!

Well, go ahead, kids, because this movie is barely above a turkey, and no amount of negative votes can rescue the fact that this is neither a decent film noir homage nor a very moving crime flick. It's just another mediocre 60s crime drama saved by Lee Marvin...and there are plenty of those to go around.

But hey...if your existence is vitiated by giving unhelpful votes in place of an intelligent comment pointing out flaws in a review, please justify yourself to yourself. Otherwise, a comment always goes a lot farther...though it may reveal one's fanboy status.

And to those pondering watching this, please read the bad reviews as well as the good, as ever, and then ask yourself, which make more sense?",1247443200,6,3802,4.538686131386862

As for Lee Marvin's peformance? It is clearly his worst. All the acting is bad and the entire cast is wasted on this mess.

A perfect meshing of style, plot, acting.  Ex-USMC leatherneck Marvin is the real deal.

401256,4,6301971876,"Released in 1967, ""Point Blank"" bridges the gap between the neo-noir films of the late 1950s and 1960s that mixed elements of classic noir with social conscience filmmaking and those of the 1970s, with their disillusioned protagonists and increasing explicitness. Walker (Lee Marvin) was a cool, competent crook, convinced by his old friend Mal Reese (John Vernon) to help heist money from some other crooks on Alcatraz Island. But Reese shot Walker, left him for dead, and took off with Walker's unfaithful wife Lynne (Sharon Acker). A year later, Walker wants revenge, he wants Reese dead, and he wants his $93,000. A mysterious mobster (Keenan Wynn) who seeks control of the criminal syndicate of which Reese is a part is happy to facilitate Walker's vendetta.

""Point Blank"" was director John Boorman's first color film, and he made good use of the palette, often dominating scenes with a single hue. Although it basically has a continuous timeline, the film takes brief excursions back in time, uses some slow motion photography, and, at one point, confuses us with images that exist only in Lee's mind, if at all. This was pretty risky for a studio film in 1967, and it works well. The fact that Walker is as much a criminal as his enemies is forgotten in a world where everyone is corrupt. Lee Marvin is great at this stoic, fixated kind of masculinity, but he does seem conspicuously old for the women Walker attracts. ""Point Blank"" is one man's revenge-driven journey, made memorable by so frequently doing the unexpected.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): There are 2 featurettes, a theatrical trailer, and a feature commentary. ""The Rock, Pt 1"" (8 min) and ""The Rock, Pt 2"" (9 min) are promotional films made in 1967 about the Alcatraz location. ""Point Blank"" was the first film to use the abandoned prison, just 4 years after it closed. The documentaries talk about using the prison as a backdrop, interview the director, and interview a former inmate who recalls the 1946 Battle of Alcatraz. The audio commentary by John Boorman and Steven Soderbergh is very good. Soderbergh questions Boorman on various aspects of the film, including the script, structure, collaboration with Lee Marvin, technical details, and interpretations of the film.

""Point Blank"" is explosive, fast-paced, and still the acting is there.

Lee Marvin is at his best. Angie Dickinson. in her strong performance, is as beautiful as ever. Keenan Wynn and Carroll O'Connor play their parts to the hilt and it truly shows. John Vernon (who was The Mayor in ""Dirty Harry"") plays a slimy type with diligence and very believable.

Add the killing pace of the entire picture, and you have a hot item, as sharp and cutting as ""Film Noir"" can be.

Yes, because this is still a ""Film Noir"", despite the fact that it was filmed in Color and in the mid-sixties.

John Boorman (""Hell in the Pacific"", ""Deliverance"" and ""The Emerald Forest""), skillfully ""color coded"" the entire movie, bringing it from absolute colors at the beginning, to more red-tinted ones towards the end.

The only difference from a true ""Film Noir"" is its fast-paced storyline, that would lead us to movies as I have mentioned above.

Marvin's minimalistic acting, but forceful presence, is enough to fill every frame of the movie with tension, action and complete mayhem.

Compare him in ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""The Big Red One"" and you will see what I mean.

401320,4,6301971876,"This review is for the Warner Brothers DVD released in 2005.

 `Point Blank' starts out in an abandoned Alcatraz Prison circa 1967 where Walker (Lee Marvin), his wife, and Mal Reese (John Vernon - probably best remembered as Dean Wormer in `Animal House') rob an apparently illegal money payoff.  Once the money is counted, Reese shoots Walker in a prison cell leaving him for dead and takes Walker's $93,000.  Walker recovers from the shooting and with the help of a stranger named Yost (Keenan Wynn), Walker finds out that Reese and Walker's wife ran off to Los Angeles and Reese is now a big player in a major crime syndicate.  This sets up the rest of the movie where Walker hunts down Reese but also wants all of this $93,000 back.

The movie is clearly dark in mood and substance, even though it was filmed in vibrant color.  Angie Dickenson plays the role of Walker's sister-in-law Chris, who helps him find Reese.  The chemistry between Chris and Walker seems overtly empty and melancholy.  An animated Carroll O'Conner (best known for playing Archie Bunker in 'All in the Family') brings a lot of energy to the last segment of the movie.  The film has an unmistakably late `60's look with fast and chaotic flashbacks and over-accentuated sound effects - such as loud, reverberating footsteps when an intensely focused Lee Marvin is hunting down Reese.  This movie is more sexual and violent than noir films of the `40's and `50's, but is still restrained by today's standards. The film's biggest asset is how Lee Marvin confronts and handles his adversaries - each situation is original and effective, but not over the top. The plot as a whole has very few major surprises, although there is one minor twist in the end.  Overall, it's an extremely good movie, but not a great one, but I still strongly recommend it.

As for the DVD, the transfer is superb.  The picture quality is free of even the tiniest of flaws and the color is bright and vivid and the sharpness is terrific for a film this old.  The audio is also excellent.  There is option real-time commentary by director John Boorman and filmmaker Steven Soderbergh, plus two short features, both made when the film was being shot in the late `60's entitled the Rock Part I &II.  These two documentaries deal with the filming of the scenes on Alcatraz that were used in `Point Blank'.  Part II also contains a short interview with a former prisoner who did time on ""The Rock""..

401323,5,6301971876,"It's about time this movie got released on DVD.

It's odd that a film could spawn a remake (""Payback""), a glib nod (""Grosse Pointe Blank"") and countless homages (""The Limey,"" among others) and still be as underseen as ""Point Blank.""

The lack of a disc certainly didn't help its low profile, but of course this is a challenging, idiosyncratic movie, even three decades later.  The plot is simple -- a crook is betrayed by his wife and partner and spends the rest of the movie trying to get what he's owed -- but the editing and narrative structure is unusual.  What in the world did audiences possibly make of this back when it was first released?

It's a remarkable film, as startling and innovative as Richard Lester's ""Petulia,"" although admittedly it's thematically much less complex.

This edition is excellent, too.  Great sound, great picture and a fantastic commentary by director John Boorman and big-time ""Point"" fan Steven Soderbergh, who laughingly admits to Boorman that he's ripped this movie off more than a few times.  Their chat is more technical than gossipy and deals heavily with the editing, the production (the script was only 70 pages long), the studio's concerns about the picture, the actors, violence, surrealism (is it all a dream?) and Boorman's elaborate use of color (the tones of clothing and sets intensify over the course of the film).

I've gotten a lot of good DVD's this year but in terms of content, presentation and extas, this is one of the best.",1122768000,30,1485,4.83794466403162
401354,5,6301971876,"This is my favorite Lee Marvin movie because the tough-guy acting is great and the visuals and film techniques are before its time. This movie is violent even by today's standards and the DVD has a clear picture, great sound and is in wide-screen.  The commentary by John Boorman and Steve Soderbergh is great on explaining each scene and how it came about.  I liked the Mel Gibson remake, although I feel Lee Marvin is the better actor for this role because he looks and feels like a killer.  My other favorite Lee Marvin movie is Hell in the Pacific, also directed by Boorman.",1122249600,5,578,4.538461538461538
401355,5,6301971876,"""Point Blank"" is as much a throwback to the classic film noir of the forties and fifties but also ushered in the more provocative filmmaking that was to come.  It's no accident that this film came out the same year as ""Bonnie and Clyde"", another film that changed the vocabulary of American filmmaking.  We are only offered a rooting interest in the cold-hearted Walker(Lee Marvin) inasmuch as he is less reprehensible than the members of the Organization that are more despicable than he.  And what of the $93,000.00 that Walker is seeking?  Does he really want the money or is it just the pretense for payback(sorry for referencing the Mel Gibson remake) for leaving him for dead at the money drop?  This was daring and provocative subject matter for it's day when we still asked that good and bad be clearly defined and bad would be delivered their just desserts.  Needless to say, Lee Marvin just defines icewater cool as Walker.  Good supporting cast includes John Vernon as Walker's slimy partner in crime, a delectable Angie Dickinson as Walker's wife's sister, and Carroll O'Connor as a colorful partner in the Organization.  James Sikking kind of predates the SWAT commander he played on ""Hill Street Blues"" with his role as the sharpshooter.  Director John Boorman manages to maintain the right balance of homage to classic noir with some modern jazzy touches that make the film a true original.  Essential viewing.",1121558400,9,1425,4.924686192468619
401356,5,6301971876,"Leave it to John Boorman to combine the stylized storytelling of French New Wave with American film noir in ""Point Blank"". This fascinating, challenging movie was made in 1967 when the film world was in the embrace of experimental film. Although it's quite different from ""Blow Up"", the storytelling style is just as stylized and unique. Lee Marvin plays Walker a criminal cheated out of $93,000 from a robbery of a mob like syndicate on Alcatraz by his best friend Reese(John Vernon). Participating in the heist/murder is Walker's young wife who has been having an affair with Reese. After getting the money, Reese shoots his friend, takes his wife and leaves him for dead on Alcatraz.

With the help of a mysterious benefactor (Keenan Wynn), Walker tracks down Reese exacting revenge in pursuit for what he's owed. When his wife commits suicide, Walker seeks out her sister Chris (Angie Dickinson)in hope of luring Reese out of hiding. From there this convoluted mystery spins more threads than director John Boorman knows what to do with but, surprisingly, he keeps the story from getting too tangled up.

Boorman and director Steven Soderbergh (""Ocean's 11"", ""Solaris"", ""Sex Lies and Videotape"")provide a fascinating commentary track on the making of the movie. Boorman recalls that originally Lee Marvin wanted Peggy Lee for the role that Dickinson plays. While he went with Boorman's decision of Dickinson he wasn't very nice to his co-star which worked particularly during the scene where Dickinson starts hitting Marvin. Dickinson hit Marvin so hard he had bruises the next day but the actor stoically took the hits and the camera kept rolling. Boorman also discusses the stylized approach he uses in shooting the film including a sequence in Walker's deceased wife's apartment that where the body disappears in an almost dream like sequence, the furniture disappears and Marvin's clothes change. The studio was so concerned when it saw the first cut of this sequence it hired a psychologist to come talk to the director.

Featuring a stunning transfer from Warner Home Video and a nearly perfect brand new print of the film, ""Point Blank"" looks sharp with vivid colors. The mono soundtrack with some of its unusual sound effects (the sound of Walker's feet providing a percussive element to one sequence in particularly)also sounds remarkably clear. There's also a two part promo featurette ""The Rock"" which focuses on the shooting of the movie on Alcatraz (it was the first movie shot there since the prison closed in 1963 and had been turned into a state park). Using San Francisco, Santa Monica and Los Angeles as a backdrop, the film features stunning cinematography. If Don Siegel had watched the French New Wave prior to making some of his noir laced thrillers, this is what it might have looked like.

Remade with Mel Gibson as a more traditional looking thriller called ""Payback"", ""Point Blank"" features Marvin in one of his most stoic, powerful and grim performances. His character of Walker leaves a trail of dead bodies without remorse or regret in pursuit of what is rightfully his. Unlike a lot of films that incorporated the surreal touch of the French New Wave (such as Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player"" or any of Goddard's films), ""Point Blank"" has aged remarkably well with Boorman's stylized use of sets, camera set ups, flasbacks, etc. suggesting what's really going on inside of Walker's head. There's also a suggestion that maybe Walker didn't survive (particularly during the last sequence)and that ""Point Blank"" represents the dying delusion of a man thirsting for revenge. A marvelous film filled with many, many levels, this classic thriller does not have a straight forward narrative so if you're expecting a realistic film noir or story, you should look elsewhere.",1121472000,118,3802,5.068690095846645
401357,5,6301971876,"This film is one of the all-time greats! And now, it is FINALLY on DVD! I grabbed it up the first day (two days ago now) and watch it for the first time with commentary from Boorman with Steven Soderbergh. WOW! Great insight into the mind of the director and into the backstage mechanics of getting such a challenging film made! They talk scripts, lenses, character and locations and so much more. One really funny story is about how Boorman believes that the script that Gibson made Payback with closely resembles the script that Lee Marvin originally read, then threw out a window. Nice.

It's troubling that this DVD has gone into Special Order mode here on Amazon, just two days after its release. I know that there's not a lot of demand for this film (as tragic as that is), but come on!

One last thing: Look, don't buy this movie if you want the story handed to you, okay? If you like linear, A to B, B to C storytelling, this movie is not for you. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with this kind of storytelling, it's just not what you'll find in Point Blank.

But if you want to stretch your ideas of what story can be, definitely take a look at this film! And if you do, just remember...this story may or may not really take place...it may just be all in someone's mind.",1120694400,4,1287,4.376569037656904
401358,5,6301971876,In this 1960s tale of an ex criminal seeking his share of the proceeds of a heist on Alcatraz is absorbing to say the least. Boorman is at his best in this noir classic which comes to life via the standout performance of Lee Marvin which while reminiscent of his role in the earlier The Killers which saw him excel with sidekick Gulager this time he plays the lone avenger brutal and uncompromising in his quest for justice as he sees it. Ably supported by good pal Keenan Wynn as agent provocetuer Marvin again shows us his abundant talent when playing such roles. Marvin stood head and shoulders above the pack during the 60s in playing the bad guy with a point to prove and he had an edgy quality that others tried to emulate but never duplicate. He had other notable performances in later years with Paint Your Wagon being the stand out but to my mind he will be better remembered for his work in the 1960s which includes his top shelf role in The Dirty Dozen which sadly never reaped him the rewards it should have but at least gave Marvin devotees another classic to revel in. Point Blank as the Killers before it no doubt had some bad press in some quarters due to the violence of the plot which I think overstates this issue. The violence was integral to the plot as with the Killers and as such has to be viewed accordingly. When looked at now in retrospect the violence when compared to later movies was relatively tame. Marvin played his roles as freewheeling and uncompromising as he lived his life generally and it gave his performances that added touch of reality and believabilty which many of his peers failed to produce often appearing wooden in comparison. Marvin was a one off talent the like of which sadly we may never see again. In short Point Blank like all Marvin efforts is a stand out. A notable supporting role included Angie Dickenson who joined Marvin no doubt as a result of their roles in the Killers and gives a good account of herself in a challenging role. One could never say Dickenson was simply eye candy as she showed in many good performances in the 70 and 80s and was a good foil for a rampant Marvin in this role as he tracks down the bad guys and eventually finds he has been the tool of a devious manipulator all along who uses Marvin to wipe out his opposition in the organisation hierachy. The ending of the film is brilliant in that it removes the almost inevitablity of the principle story line and leaves us at Alcatraz without knowing whether Walker took his money or not. This added another touch to what is a good uncomplicated fast moving script well suited to a winning performance by Marvin. The main setting chosen for the movie namely Alcatraz also gives that edgy feel so often associated with Marvin films. A classic for the Marvin buffs.,1119571200,8,2796,4.495088408644401
401359,5,6301971876,"No, it's not full of Raymond Chandler style simile's.  No, there's no voiceover.  There's no Bogie or Bacall, but Lee Marvin is more believable taking on the syndicate in this movie than Bogie could ever be.  And Angie Dickinson serves quite nicely as replacement eye candy for Lauren Bacall, thank you.  The soundtrack is very good, too.

The depiction of the corporatized mob is also brilliant.  Carroll O'Connor is excellent as the surprisingly energetic mob middle manager.

I saw an interview with Schlesinger in which he said that Lee Marvin completely improvised his silence in the scene where he meets up again with his girlfriend.  He was supposed to say some fairly standard things ripping her for leaving him but decided it'd play better not saying a thing.  It does.",1113609600,15,778,4.923076923076923

Walker (Lee Marvin) took part in a heist which went sour.  Double-crossed and shot by his partner Mal Reese (John Vernon), who also takes up with his wife, who thinks he is dead; Walker, however, survives and comes back for his ninety-three thousand dollar share, and vengeance.  This film is reminiscent of the movie, ""Payback,"" with Mel Gibson, which has a very similar plot.  It, however, came later.

Filmed partly on the old federal prison at Alcatraz (Pelican) Island, in San Francisco Bay, as well as in several other old cell blocks, the set alone is interesting.

Angie Dickinson plays Chris, Walker's sister-in-law.  In one scene she administers a physical beating to Lee Marvin that must have required him to wear padded clothing to withstand it, even though he is larger, and, one would expect, much stronger.  She really cuts loose and is not pulling her punches, most of which land on his chest.

This is an entertaining film, and results in some very satisfying feelings of vengeance.

401361,3,6301971876,Most people view this as being a classic however in my view it does not quite meet those standards.  Having read the novels for such a long time and watching the action unfold to be precise disapointment was one word and awe another.  Watching Marvin as Walker a thief who plays himself as wanting no blood on his hands he charges through the criminal under world with an unmatched temper.  Seeking out the friend who double crossed and the wife who became his lover.  Playing off as a Parker character he does it great through the acting but the action is missing a few pages.  As the cold blooded Walker he does not even kill anyone rather he just forces them around.  Which did not settle well with me as a reader of the novels as stated above this lead to me believe that Hollywood wanted a movie which would not offend.  It makes me beg the question of why produce is anyway.  High caliber actors and a great assortment of characters dot this story of a man seeking his claims but why edit the violence from the novel?  Making his character like a declawed kitten however he is they do however redeem themselves.  Marvin walks into a bathroom ambush and walks out leaving two bleeding and injured hitmen behind.  On top of that he managed to play the character to a near Gibson like... well if you can call it that standard.  Boorman directed this and he did an okay job there are things which could have been improved.  Stylish film noir does not quite fit this as a tag line rather it's more of a PI story laced with the criminal elements over the noir factors.  Get Payback done better and with a more cold static feeling.,1056067200,4,1630,4.408026755852843
401362,4,6301971876,"POINT BLANK is a worthy, simple gangster picture that tried to turn revenge into movie art.  The artsy vehicle employed in this attempt was the flashback.  Unfortunately it did not do the trick.  The flashbacks were distracting.  They added nothing to the story dimension of the film.  Despite the flashbacks I enjoyed this film.  The star lead, Walker [Lee Marvin]is not a hero, but a righteously revengeful mobster: revenge because his pal leaves him for dead and steals his share of the ""take.""  Marvin was the ideal star for this film; taciturn, quietly heroic, and good with the fists. Lloyd Bochner and Michael Strong are well cast as the socially acceptable members of the modern Mob. You'll never forget two splendidly directed scenes.  First, when Walker manages to bypass the goons guarding his ex-pal, then kills him in a penthouse--the first revenge. A second splendid scene that didn't mean much to the revenge angle, but spiced the film with a sprig of romance--was Angie Dickinson pounding  Lee Marvin unrelentingly with both fists in a fit of scorn until she falls to her knees.  Although Walker manages to gain some revenge the story-plot is unresolved at the end and the so-called ""Twist"" does not make sense. What does make sense is this modern underworld film without gutter profanity.  That is a treat worth not hearing  in POINT BLANK.",993340800,5,1357,4.929515418502203

The character is named Parker, and the books are wonderful. ""Point Blank"" captures the characters' shark-like personality, he doesn't register your existence unless it affects the heist, or his appetites at the time. ""Payback"" is not even worth typing a sentence about. The Parker paperbacks are somewhat hard to find, but are worth the effort, find as many as you can. There is also a series of re-prints, titles have been changed.",987724800,6,590,5.030612244897959
7818991,5,6301971876,"It's easy to see that revenge movies have been trying unsuccessfully to recapture this tone and style for the past 50 years.  Lee Marvin was able to totally inhabit a dark type of character by this point in his career better than Keanu Reeves, Denzel Washington, or even Liam Neeson ever will.  They simply do not have the stature or the skillset he had.  The script really isn't even that strong.  It's the performance and the cinematography which will stay with you.  The energy and moral ambiguity of 1967 is fully captured in a way that is quite credible.  Most films of this era still had a rather stiff and rigid formality but this one almost always feels loose and spontaneous even though it pays homage to Bogart, Cagney, Robinson, etc.  I consider this the perfect link between those crime stories of old and the ones made even in 2018.",1524700800,,845,4.593333333333334
