3466180,2,B001ARDBXU,"Fox has been scouring its archives for forgotten treasures, sometimes illustrating the old saying that some undiscovered masterpieces should remain undiscovered. Here's the proof: The first Horror volume was a nifty journey into darkness and doom, but the follow-up is scary in a different way. Here we have Chandu the Magician (1932), adapted from pulps with a bravado performance from Bela Lugosi, fresh from Dracula, who chews the scenery as he sinks his teeth deep into the role. Unfortunately the hero, played by Edmund Lowe, buckles when he should swashbuckle, and is all too polite and timid for a character that should drip in derring-do. Dr. Renault's Secret (1942) is, frankly, not much of a secret. He, like Dr. Moreau and hosts of mad scientists before and since, plans to change animals into semi-humans. The star here is Harry Lachman's direction in a distinctly painterly gothic mood, but it's essentially a weak endeavor. The somewhat battered gem in this collection is Dragonwyck (1946), based on the Anya Seton potboiler. Vincent Price and Gene Tierney, reversing power roles from Laura, star as Rich Landed Gentry and Poor Country Mouse. Her father is played with puritanical prickliness by Walter Huston, Spring Byington plays a daft and scary maid, Jessica Tandy a plucky and brave maid, and it all ends up playing like some bus and truck company's take on Rebecca. Mostly pretty to look at, the film rolls along at a snail's pace with few genuinely scary moments. It's Joseph L. Mankewicz's first directorial outing, but the material is at once too scattered and overwhelming to be convincing.",1222732800,6,1615,5.075187969924812

3466182,5,B001ARDBXU,"The previous two reviews must be corrected regarding ""Chandu the Magician"" (1932).  If I am reading Amazon's product information correctly, the reviewer ""Texas refugee"" has it right: This is NOT the Bela Lugosi serial ""The Return of Chandu,"" but an earlier, more lavishly produced Fox fantasy in which Lugosi plays the villian Roxor, not the hero Chandu.  Many of us have been waiting anxiously for this flick's release on DVD. After reading about ""Chandu"" for years in fanzines and books,  I finally caught part of it on the Fox Movie Channel a couple of years ago, and I was amazed at the imaginative sets and production values.  Having this fantasy treasure finally available is reason enough to give the box set--assuming it's as nicely produced as other Fox reissues I've seen-- five stars.",1217030400,9,795,4.954887218045113
3466183,5,B001ARDBXU,"I wanted to particularly express my enthusiasm for the rarely seen ""Dr. Renault's Secret,"" a classic horror-mystery which has become something of a cult film these days. It was directed by Harry Lachman and is a Twentieth-Century Fox production.

I saw this movie for the first time on Turner Classic Movies a couple of years back and it's one of the superb old B&W horror-mystery flicks of the day ('40s). I tried to obtain it then but it wasn't available on either VHS or DVD... but it's available now!

Here's the story:

A dapper young brain surgeon, Larry Forbes, (played by John Shepperd) visits his fiance (""Madeline Renault,"" played by Lynne Roberts) at her home in a remote French villa where her mad scientist father, Dr. Renault (played by George Zucco), resides and conducts horrific experiments in his lab. In fact, Zucco has created a man (of sorts) from an ape (reminiscent of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"").

Forbes meets Noel (pronounced ""no-ELL,"" and played by J. Carrol Naish) who functions as Dr. Renault's ""Igor-like"" assistant (and actually the ape-man), who harbors a dog-like devotion for Madeline, (Dr. Renault's daughter). Forbes, to his horror, soon learns Noel's true identity.

The main trouble begins at a local Inn where, during a Bastille celebration, we meet Rogell (played by Mike Mazurki), an ex-convict who is now Renault's gardener and Austin (played by Jack Norton), a drunken American who torments Noel (not a great idea!) with his insinuations about Forbes' upcoming marriage to Madeline. Austin is soon found dead, the result of a broken neck.

Local Police Inspector Duval suspects that Forbes was the intended victim and that Rogell was the perpetrator, (Forbes had involuntarily changed his sleeping arrangements with Austin) but Duval also ponders the possibility that Noel killed Austin because of his remarks about Madeline. Duval eventually releases all the witnesses and suspects and Noel drives Forbes to the Renault estate.

A sub-plot is that Rogell plots with Henri (Renault's butler, played by Jean Del Val) to kidnap Madeline and hold her for ransom.

I'll stop there to avoid any spoilers but there are indeed some surprises in the movie. This 1942 film is shot in black-and-white and the aspect is full-screen. I'm a huge George Zucco fan and this is one of his best movies, right up there with ""The Flying Serpent"" (1946) and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" (1939). In fact, I liked it just slightly better than three other great Zucco vehicles, ""Topper Returns"" (1941), ""The Black Raven"" (1943) and, ""Fog Island"" (1945). None were more magnificent than Zucco at portraying the role of ""The Mad Scientist"". (See my Listmania List for many more of Zucco's great films, ""George Zucco... Almost Live!!!"")

If I have a problem with this film it's that it only runs for 58 minutes, but that is a common caveat of 1940s period B-movies.

As far as the ""Chandu"" (Bela Lugosi) entry goes, I can add no information except to say that there is the ADDITIONAL Chandu entry, (not on this DVD package) the 1934 SERIAL  (shown in its entirety, 12 chapters), broken down into two parts, available on two separate DVDs:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-Chandu-the-Magician-Vol-1/dp/B00006SFJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of Chandu the Magician, Vol. 1</a>

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-Chandu-the-Magician-Vol-2/dp/B00006SFJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of Chandu the Magician, Vol. 2</a>

This Lugosi serial was later edited into this 1935 film:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chandu-on-the-Magic-Island-Feature/dp/B0007OP1EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chandu on the Magic Island:Feature</a>

The SERIAL version is terrific (the movie is pretty good too but I prefer viewing the uncut version of the film) with Lugosi playing Frank Chandler, aka Chandu the Magician, as he battles on with the evil High Priest Vindhyan on the South Seas Island of Lemuria. It is on this island where Chandu's fiance, the Egyptian Princess Nadji (played by the lovely Maria Alba) is being held captive until Chandu can rescue her. You'll love seeing the special effects as Chandu ""vanishes"" into thin air -- it really freaks out his adversaries too!

I apologise that I can shed no light on the other films of this package but I did wish to present enthusiasts with some details on both ""Dr. Renault's Secret"" and ""Chandu"".",1215129600,35,4516,5.484149855907781
3466184,4,B001ARDBXU,"This really is a fine trio of B horror films from Fox. The usual problem with B horror films is that the sound is bad and the video is atrocious. Since these are being reissued by Fox, you don't have to worry about that. I have last year's volume one and all of the films were first rate in their presentation. The following are the films with their extra features:

Chandu The Magician (1932)
My favorite is ""Chandu the Magician"". Bela Lugosi plays Roxor, who has kidnapped Robert Regent and his death ray. Roxor wants to use the weapon to aid in his plan for world domination. Chandu the magician intervenes using his special power of being able to make men see whatever he wants them to see. There are a couple of sight gags that get used once too often, and towards the end the special effects are a little cheesy, but in horror that can just add to the fun.

Dr. Renault's Secret (1942)
I haven't seen this one since grade school on Saturday mornings, but I remember it pretty well as a fine old horror film. Zucco plays the title role, but the centerpiece of the film is J. Carroll Naish who is an ape that has been turned into a man by Dr. Renault's experiments. Trouble begins when Renault brings his ape-man back to his villa in France and allows him to interact with other humans, most notably Renault's daughter.

3466185,4,B001ARDBXU,At $13.99 this is a bargain.  I paid more than that for only a 'fair' VHS copy of Dr. Renault's Secret (a film I like very much).  While I agree with another reviewer that there are other 'classics' out there I would like to see offered...I would have no problem paying this price just for Dr. Renault's Secret and consider the other 2 films a bonus.,1213747200,15,350,4.287878787878788
3466186,4,B001ARDBXU,"In Fox's second set of ""horror classics"",  Gene Tierney and Vincent Price are in 1946's ""Dragonwyck"", a Gothic period thriller, not a horror film, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and set in the old mansion of title. It's based on a popular 1944 novel of the same name. Then there's 1932's ""Chandu the Magician"", based on the old serial, with Bela Lugosi in a battle over a death ray. Again, this film is more of an adventure (followed by sequels) and not really a horror film.  And then there's 1942's ""Dr. Renault's Secret"" with horror vet George Zucco as the doctor and J.Carrol Naish as his ""assistant"" who's a tad on the simian side and capable of committing murder. This is a low budget affair, runs only around 58 minutes and it's played more like a drama--- not like a horror film. Of course, all of these films are worth a look for their casts (especially ""Dragonwyck""), their rarity and their b&w restoration, but none of them really qualify as ""classic horror"". Except maybe ""Dr. Renault's Secret"", but judge for yourself. I was hoping for genuine classic horror films that Fox found and restored. Maybe next time.",1213056000,59,1125,4.7055837563451774

3466204,3,B001ARDBXU,"I bought this for Dragonwyck, having been led to think it's a better and more suspenseful movie than it is. I was expecting something on the order of Rebecca or Suspicion, but it's more like a made-for-TV movie set in the 1840s. It's a Gothic, film noir, romantic, haunted-house story, and it's pretty predictable. Things that work are the cast and the directing, particularly camera angles and lighting that are usually seen in detective films of the 40s, not Gothic romances. It is otherwise rather dull, but I would have liked this movie when I was in my teens or twenties. If you like this genre, you may love this film.
I watched part of Dr. Renault's Secret, which is reminiscent of Island of Lost Souls but not as good. Maybe I'm jaded.

3466216,5,B001ARDBXU,"Let's start this awesome 3 pack of madmen off with DRAGONWYCK!! Vincent Price is one of the masters of the horror genre, and he shines in this well crafted mystery of murder, drugs and lust! He plays opposite of the beautiful and great actress, Gene Tierney. She is wonderful as the sweet and innocent farm girl who comes to wealth and marriage with the powerful landowner, Vincent Price. Settings are spectacular... For instance, the detail given to Tierney's farm cottage is brilliant. Even though the setting is short lived, pay attention to the detail of the house. Around the fireplace comes to mind. Then you move on to the mansion of Price... In which is beautiful. Supporting actors, who are actually billed above Price, are excellent as well. I have seen many a Vincent Price film and this without a doubt is one of his finest. Possibly his best. Must see for fans of his.

Next up... CHANDAU THE MAGICIAN! This film is screaming for more LUGOSI!! His portrayal of the madman, ROXOR is fun, frightening, and it's great to see Lugosi still looking young, full of energy... Even though he was already over the age of 50. He doesn't look it though. As with Vincent Price I have seen a boat load of Lugosi films. The good, the bad, and the ugly. This film is a must have for the Lugosi fan, even though it will not live up to your expectations. The film looks beautiful and sets are pretty cool... But you will find not enough of Lugosi and too much of CHANDAU!

And now, for the finale... DOCTOR RENAULT'S SECRET... oops, I think I heard the record scratch when I typed the word SECRET!! Good Lordy and the goose-fat!! The only thing secret with this film is the fact its set in a French village. The only problem is, no one sounds remotely French!! You got to love it though! I mean, who would pay attention to detail when George Zucco is beating a half man/half ape with a whip. It kind of brings a tear to my eye. The good in this film... George Zucco and J. Carrol Naish. The bad... The rest of the cast, including that little fat bartender who was in THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE. He ruined that movie and he helps to ruin this one as well. And the ugly... J. Carrol Nash. Watch only if you dare!!",1355184000,5,2209,4.411764705882353
3466217,4,B001ARDBXU,"The four stars are for ""Dragonwyck"". The other films are of lower quality.

The worst is ""Chandu the Magician"", based on a radio show popular with the kiddies. Though made on a tight budget, the art direction was by the great William Cameron Menzies, and it looks far better than it has any right to. It's fun to see once, but -- other than providing a ""camp treat"" for guests -- it's not a film for repeat viewing.

""Dr. Renault's Secret"" -- that he's surgically converted an ape into a man -- is better. It's half of a double feature (the other half being ""The Undying Finster"", which I reviewed in the first set of ""Fox Horror Classics""). Though not as well-directed or spectacularly photographed as that film, it still avoids looking too much like the cheap B picture it is.

""Secret"" is worth seeing for J Carroll Naish's subtle, controlled performance as the ape-turned human. What could have been a stupid and campy performance is instead touching and pathetic.

""Dragonwyck"" is the only A movie of the lot. I've often wondered whether Vincent Price could really act, and oh, brother, could he. It's an understated and finely tuned performance that would do credit to all but a handful of the best actors. It's unfortunate that Price chose to become a self-indulgent camp-follower.

Fox's restorations of ""Secret"" and ""Dragonwyck"" are magnificent. All three films have excellent running commentaries and ""making of"" featurettes. (This attention to detail has become typical of Fox.)

Unlike the first box -- essentially a tribute to John Brahm -- the second has only one really good film that you might want to watch more than once. Your call.",1318118400,,1650,4.833333333333333
3466228,4,B001ARDBXU,"I enjoyed all 3 movies. I will admit Dragonwyck is not really a horror movie and that Chandu is more matinee adventure than horror but I did enjoy them as part of the set.
Dr. Renaults Secret is a solid horror movie that is worth having this set for alone. It is a good story well directed and acted.
The extras on each one are nice also I really like the commentary on Chandu and found it very informative.

All in all a great purchase and hours of entertainment.",1312329600,,464,4.213483146067416
3466229,5,B001ARDBXU,"Because I am a rabid Bela Lugosi fan, I greatly enjoyed this collection. Chandu the Magician features Bela as one of his greatest villians: Roxnor! A black cloaked wizard in a tomb full of Frankenstein-like machines and weilding a ""death ray"" with which to rule the world! This is like Indian Jones finding a forgotten Idol of pure gold -in fantasy adventure! A Bela Lugosi MUST SEE!

Dragonwyck is a gothic romance with a very young Vincent Price doing his very cool Vincent Price thing. Lovely.

Dr. Renault's Secret is a wonderful horror film. An amazing proformance by J Carrol Naish as the heart breakingly human ape-man. George Zucco at his mad doctor best. A great addition to your ""APE"" horror collection that was all the rage in the 30's and 40's.

Beautiful transfers. Lush Black and White - moody, dark, rich with shadows and depth. Nothing like a well shot  and restored Black and White film.

But are they all ""Horror"" films? Not really. Someone's pushing that genre a bit beyond it's bounds there with that claim. But still, all well worth a good watch. All ""good stories"" and that's what movies really are supposed to be.

However, if you loved Dracula, White Zombie, and Murders in the Rue Morgue, then you MUST have Chandu the Magician to see all of Lugsi's best work.",1245196800,2,1285,4.688888888888889

3466232,3,B001ARDBXU,"Fox seem to have a very creative marketing team because it is a stretch of the imagination by any standards that this extraordinary package would be classified as a horror collection. True horror enthusiasts might be very disappointed.

First off is the 1932 ""Changdu the Magician"", a boys' own adventure which not surprisingly became a serial a few years later. The film has Bela Lugosi chewing the scenery with great aplomb as he steals a death ray and tortures its inventor to learn how to use it. Edmund Lowe, a matinee idol of yesteryear, is a stiff and far too proper hero but the film benefits from great photography and imaginative sets which help to overcome the dreadful script.

Next is ""Dr Renault's Secret"", a neatly directed programmer released in 1942 and with a fair gallery of supporting players, a moderately interesting story about the missing link between man and the ape and 2 fine central performances by the enigmatic George Zucco and the superb J Carroll Naish. It is a very polished ""little"" film with excellent sets and photography and the closest to a horror film of this trio.

The final film, released in 1946, is the gothic romance, ""Dragonwyck"", an expensively mounted vehicle for the rapidly rising Gene Tierney and a star making role for Vincent Price playing the sort of character he would make his own in subsequent years. This could not be classified as a horror film really (think of ""Jane Eyre"" or ""Rebecca"" and you'll get the idea) and while it is well made with good performances from the leads and the indispensible Walter Huston, it is quite dull and predictable. This was the first film directed by Joseph Mankiewicz.

The prints of the film are excellent, surprisingly so in the case of ""Changdu"" which is a very old Fox film, many of which have not survived. ""Renault"" is a very bright print preserving the outstanding Fox photography. Each film has a short documentary with the same group of dull historians. They tend to be repetitious. ""Changdu"" and ""Dragonwyck"" have good commentaries and Greg Mank is particuarly witty and entertaining with ""Changdu"". Theatrical trailers for the later films are also presented.

This is a very unusual set, nicely packaged with an insert about the films and also very cheap, possibly because it would appeal to a very limited audience. Accordingly, it is very good value if the films are of interest to you.",1228176000,8,2391,4.8504901960784315
3466233,5,B001ARDBXU,"Around a year ago, I had the opportunity to watch the movies that comprised Fox Horror Classics Volume 1.  They were enjoyable enough, but I wondered if they were truly horror films.  Similarly, I enjoyed Fox Horror Classics, Volume 2, but still wondered if the trio of could really fit the definition of horror.

Chronologically, the first in the set is Chandu the Magician, a cliff-hanging adventure which pits the mystically powered Chandu (Edmund Lowe) against Roxor (Bela Lugosi), a megalomaniac intent on world conquest with a death ray invented by Chandu's brother-in-law.  It's fun fantasy adventure reminiscent of the early adventure serials, but the only real connection to true horror is Lugosi's presence, which is also the highlight of the movie.

Next is Dr. Renault's Secret, and this movie fits much better in the horror genre.  This brief (58 minute) film is one of a series of horror films in the era that deals with men becoming animals (like The Wolf Man) or animals becoming men (like Island of Lost Souls).  In this case, the title character (George Zucco) has tried converting an ape to a human (J. Caroll Naish), but like all mad scientists, has tampered with forces he doesn't fully comprehend.  This also has veteran tough guy actor Mike Mazurki (from Murder My Sweet) involved in a kidnapping subplot.

While Dragonwyck has a vague supernatural element and a gothic atmosphere, it is more reminiscent of stories like Jane Eyre and Rebecca than what would have been considered horror at the time.  Vincent Price and Gene Tierney star, and unlike the movie Laura, there is no Dana Andrews to get in their way (but like Laura, there is a painting that plays a part in the tale).  Price is the wealthy master of the title estate who invites distant farm girl cousin Tierney to stay at his estate.  The overt reason is so she can be a companion to his daughter, but Price has a secret agenda in mind as well.  Though Tierney gets the top billing, this is really Price's movie, with a role that is a precursor to the haunted characters he would later play in the Roger Corman-directed Poe films.

All three movies in the set are fine movies, even if I don't think I'd really call them a horror set; more like one horror film, one gothic romance and one adventure story.  But even if Fox has fudged things a bit to make up the set, it is still a nice set, with commentaries on the first and third movies plus other extras.  This may not a set to treat yourself to on Halloween, but for the rest of the year, it is perfectly fine.",1224979200,2,2549,4.618625277161862
3466234,5,B001ARDBXU,"The title of this attractive set of three DVDs might be a little misleading because none of the three movies could be described as horror by today's definition, but by 1930's and 1940's standards they do fit the bill.  So the keyword here is ""Classics"" from the early Fox Studios, and some rare, unusual and charming ones they are indeed!  Each one is very different, but they all feature an outstanding cast with some legendary stars, and they are all top quality films in every aspect of production.  Furthermore, all three films have not been readily available for a long time, which makes this set an extra exciting and special treat.  For me personally, the dynamic and legendary stars - Bela Lugosi in ""Chandu the Magician"" and Vincent Price in ""Dragonwyck"" immediately appealed to me and raised my expectations, but I found so much more in all three movies that I've enjoyed watching them many times over already.

Although not the actual hero or main star, it's Bela Lugosi who steals the show in ""Chandu"", playing the evil madman, Roxor, as only Lugosi can.  Famous for his role as Count Dracula, Lugosi, alongside Boris Karloff, was the king of the horror genre in the 1930s, and while his acting might seem over-the-top in our day, his style can still win a modern audience.  ""Chandu"" features many interesting aspects of 1930's filmmaking with some impressive special effects, beautiful sets designed by the famous and award-winning William Cameron Menzies, and an unusual story about a Western yogi mystic who saves the world from Roxor's evil clutches by using his special magic.  Back in the 1920s and 30s the Western world was fascinated by India and its mysticism, which explains why ""Chandu"" was actually a popular children's radio show back then, and this innocent, childlike fun and fascination with magic is evident in this movie.

As Lugosi's crown began to fade, the next king of the horror genre prepared to take over, and ""Dragonwyck"" is the first film to feature Vincent Price as a sinister, evil character; a role he fully embraced some years later to become the best known horror actor of more recent decades.  Unlike his later roles, in ""Dragonwyck"" Price plays a character who appears normal and charming at first, and his devious plan is only gradually revealed as the story progresses.  As a rich nobleman in early 19th century America, Price plays the part perfectly, especially when his new young wife begins to realize what danger she is in, and more and more of his mentally warped character comes to the surface.  Also rich in lavish set designs, ""Dragonwyck"" throws light on a little-known part of American history while weaving an intricate plot in which many talented stars of the day contribute and support Price, such as Gene Tierney, famous for Film Noir movies like ""Laura"" who plays Price's young wife, and Walter Huston as her religiously fundamental father.  Unlike ""Chandu"" which is fun and playful, ""Dragonwyck"" is serious and for the most part quite believable, and is overall a first-class drama of the mid 1940s.

""Dr Renault's Secret"" completes this perfect trio of unusual movies of the early horror genre, this time featuring another gifted performer, J. Carrol Naish, who plays the role of a man who has been transformed from a gorilla so convincingly, that one could almost believe it to be possible.  The experiment of a doctor with good intentions, Noel, as he is named, struggles to be a man in the human world while retaining his memory of life in the Javanese jungle, along with various animal instincts.  The angle I enjoyed most in this film is that the mind of the gorilla-turned-man is one of love and peace, rather than wild, savage and primitive instincts, which people generally believed.  In a time when King Kong and other horror films featuring wild and dangerous apes were popular, ""Dr Renault's Secret"" must have been a refreshing and intelligent change, and it still has that effect today.  In fact, for anyone tired of the modern horror film with excessive gore, frights and terror, this set will be a welcome change, as well as a very pleasant and educational insight into films of the 1930s and 40s, with the help of good notes and audio commentary with two of the films.  There are other bonus features such as short documentaries about the films which serve as a good introduction, or simply to explain a few things for those not familiar with these older films and its stars.  Picture and sound quality are perfect, and all three films provide a wonderful escape from the modern world.",1224892800,,4566,4.851994851994852
3466235,5,B001ARDBXU,"I bought this for ""Dr Renault's Secret"", which has a remarkably subtle performance by J. Carroll Naish as a half-man, half-ape creature. This is such a cliche that it's hard to imagine someone doing a good job of it, but this is a remarkable film. This remake of the long-lost silent film ""The Wizard"" is highly recommended. The print is beautiful.

""Chandu The Magician"" is a revelation for those of us who never bought any of the previously available public domain DVDs. Lugosi is at his best - this is right after ""Dracula"", ""Murders In The Rue Morgue"", and ""White Zombie"" - and he is in his prime, as the accompanying documentary takes pains to emphasize. The photography is drop-dead gorgeous if you're into films from 1930-1936. The hero himself (Chandu) could have been played by a more dynamic actor than Edmund Lowe, but he really doesn't screw it up as badly as the documentary implies. Again, the print is beautiful.

I haven't watched ""Dragonwyck"" yet, but the New Yorker magazine thinks it's the highlight of the set.

So what are you waiting for? Buy it.",1224288000,,1068,4.731182795698925
3466236,4,B001ARDBXU,A terrific example of classic movie making with Dragonwyck (a must see for any classic film buff) and complete camp from Chandu the Magician. Dr. Renault's Secret is a terrific example of some of the very best character actors of the making a terrific movie from an absurd script!

3466237,5,B001ARDBXU,"Mystery and suspense so thick you could cut it with a knife.  Magic, science fiction and gothic horror all rolled up into a fantastic set of three DVD's. The restorations are excellent allowing for full enjoyment of the acting, photography and set design by some of the great Hollywood masters.

CHANDU
The powers of mysticism, hypnotism and magic are harnessed to fight evil madman Roxor (Bella Lugosi) bent on enslaving the world with a terrifying death ray. Lugosi is at the top of his game. The special effects, photography and sets are superb.

DR. RENAULT'S SECRET
A scientist monkeys with the genealogical tree of primates and unknowingly provokes a clash between creatures from different branches. Man and chimp ape each other producing a drama full of suspense, excellent acting, sets and make up. This is one of those ""He tampered in God's domain"" thrillers.

DRAGONWYCK
Vincent Price once said he most wanted to be remembered for this film. Giving the defining performance of his career, he creates the prototype character for which he will later be famous.
Dragonwyck is a lavish, exquisitely filmed, gothic romance based on historical events occurring around New York State's Hudson River in the early 1800's. Miranda (Gene Tierney) is invited to the estate of wealthy Patroon Nicholas Van Ryn (Vincent Price) to be a tutor for his troubled daughter. She arrives only to be caught up in a bizarre battle of succession between rebellious tenant farmers and hereditary landlords. Trapped between the dark past and an uncertain future; haunted by the ghost of his great grandmother, Van Ryn struggles to insure the continuation of his title and possession of lands.

Van Ryn's wife dies mysteriously, but not before another damsel is enticed into his den of procreation - and guess who the lucky woman is!  But as in all stories of the genre, dragons are destined to face off with a dragon-slayer, either on the field of battle or within the beast's lair.

This is filmmaking at its best.",1223596800,,1998,4.9640718562874255

Very well acted by all. The special effects and cinematography are excellent. Part horror film and part Indiana Jones.

Gene Tierney is 110 in the shade in ""Dragonwyck""  Tierney met John F. Kennedy, a young World War II veteran, who was visiting the set of Dragonwyck in 1946. They began a romance that she ended the following year after Kennedy told her he could never marry her because of his political ambitions.

8279169,2,B001ARDBXU,"I just watched Dragonwyck -- it was on You Tube -- and I'm not sure why it's part of this Fox Horror Classics compilation.  It's not a horror movie.  It's what would be called a Gothic movie or Gothic romance movie (although I don't think there was much of a romance here).  Dragonwyck can be considered a good movie but it's just not really to my liking.  Too much God talk.  Maybe it was true to the time and characters, I don't know.  But I didn't care for it.  And the big reveal about Vincent Price's character towards the end just wasn't that big a deal to me.  Some people will watch Dragonwyck and think it a four or five star movie.
