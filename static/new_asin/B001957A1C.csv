BEST OF FIGHT NIGHT LIVE

This is a best of set featuring fights from the first three Fight Night Live events that started in 2005. This first addition is hosted by the great Rich ""Ace"" Franklin who recently scored a huge close decision victory over one of my favorite fighters ever Wanderlei Silva.

1. PETE SPRATT VS JOSH KOSCHECK-the first fight on the set feature a fighter that I absolutely hate in Koscheck. The fight does not last long when only two minutes into the first Koscheck sinks in a tight rear naked choke up against the cage. Quick but nice fight and Josh gets the win with a nice submission. 5/5

2. MIKE SWICK VS GIDEON RAY-two really good fighters come to compete in this one with one of my favorites Mike Swick going up against the powerful Ray. This one lasts just a few seconds as Swick proves his ""Quick"" hands are no joke. This is also the fight were the announcers make me laugh every time, Goldberg is well you will see. Very fast fight and very exciting, great addition to the set. 5/5

3. KENNY FLORIAN VS ALEX KARALEXIS-very exciting first round between these two as they just battle it out with every thing they have. This round is full of big punches, kicks, knees and bodies flying every were until the bell rings to end the round. The second round is just as exciting with Kenny getting a take down early but Alex just lays into him and was on the way to winning since Kenny was getting tired. But after a perfectly placed elbow Kenny wins after cutting Alex open. Excellent fight with a somewhat disappointing ending, still a very exciting fight. 5/5

4. SPENCER FISHER VS THIAGO ALVES-the first round is excellent as both guys come out swinging and nail each other hard. Then once on the ground Fisher goes for submission after submission while Alves ground and pounds, and looses a point after an illegal knee. The second round looks just like the first until Spencer puts Alves in one of the most beautiful triangles I have ever seen. Excellent fight with an excellent finish. 5/5

5. BRANDON VERA VS FABIANO SCHERNER-the first round is good with both men going for it standing and on the ground. Not as exciting as the previous fights but it is a good battle none the less. The second round is all about knees from the start with Fabiano hitting some hard knees on Vera. But after a while Vera not only lands a lot of knees him self but ends the fight with one. 4.5/5

6. CHRIS LEBEN VS EDWIN DEWEES-Leben has always been a favorite of mine ever since the first Ultimate Fighter season, so you know who I was gong for during this when it was live. Excellent fight that never leaves the first round as Leben controls the fight grounding and pounding and eventually locking in an arm bar and making Edwin tap. This was a surprise since Leben is known for his crazy haymaker knockouts, excellent fight. 5/5

7. SPENCER FISHER VS AARON RILEY-the second fight on the set with Spencer Fisher as he faces Aaron Riley. Excellent first round between these two warriors with Fisher's fast and heavy hands and Riley slamming Fisher and drawing first blood. After a very even round the doctor's call the fight after finding that Riley got his jaw broken. Great fight even though it only goes one round. 5/5

8. MELVIN GUILLARD VS JOSH NEER-another fight that never leaves the first round and this is a bloody one. Guillard is very quick and explosive and really takes it to Neer and cuts him open badly. I thought that Neer was in danger of loosing due to the doctors stopping the fight. But he guts it out and sinks in a tight triangle that forces Melvin to tap. 5/5

9. DUANE LUDWIG VS JONATHAN GOULET-this fight lasts only 11 seconds and is one of the best knock outs ever. Goulet who is one of the best in the game gets knocked out by Duane with a very technically placed fist. 5/5

10. CHRIS LEBEN VS JORGE RIVERA-The Crippler is back and Leben is looking to win once more but in his way is Jorge Rivera. But Rivera does not make it out of the first round as Leben connects with a nice left followed by taking his back and nailing him till the ref stops it. 5/5

11. DREW FICKETT VS JOSH BURKMAN-this fight would see the reality star killer Drew Fickett who hated the Ultimate Fighter guys fighting one of those very fighters. Before any thing else I wish that they would have put his victory over Josh Koscheck. This fight would not go his way however because soon after the round starts he gets put into a tight guillotine choke. 5/5

12. STEPHAN BONNAR VS JAMES IRVIN-this is a good fight that once again only lasts the first round. After some good ground work from both guys Bonnar sinks in a nice kimura and the ref steps in after the tap to stop it. A nice way to end the DVD and I like the little Forrest comment he makes. 5/5

This DVD has a great behind the scenes feature that all will enjoy in my opinion. This is an excellent DVD that any new comer to the sport or any hardcore fan will love, buy it now.",1245542400,7,4953,4.393013100436681
8271883,5,B001957A1C,"These fights are exciting, entertaining and suspenseful. There are some surprising winnings. If you like action and fighting movies, you won't want to miss this one.",1243641600,,165,5.384615384615385
8271884,5,B001957A1C,"This set is for anyone that is a fan of UFC/MMA. None of these fights have been released on DVD, mainly due to none of the UFN's being released on DVD making every fight on this set hard to find. Since its a best of, you are getting the best of the first 3 UFC Fight Night events(12 fights including pre-lims that weren't even aired on the broadcast). I recommend this set for everyone!
