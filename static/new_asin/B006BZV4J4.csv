8496283,5,B006BZV4J4,"Episodes 385 to 416 feature on this discset and feature the 1983 cliffhanger (416). What a good cliffhanger to end the set!!

Screened between August and November 1983 in Australia these episodes feature Wentworth's new governor Ann Reynolds (the late Gerda Nicolson) settled into her role. Interesting storylines revolving around Petra Roberts (Penny Maegraith) and Pixie Mason (Judy McBurney) continue and are certainly an improvement on the Lainie/Alan storyline on the last boxset. There's a deadly fever in Wentworth - Who will fall victim to it? Hazel Kent (Belinda Davey) has a request for Judy Bryant (Betty Bobbitt). Will Judy be able to help out? Will Joan Ferguson (Maggie Kirkpatrick) finally triumph in her battle with Bea Smith (Val Lehman)?

Lisa Aldenhoven (last seen in episode 1 as Sally Lee) pops up at the Halfway House as a girl having problems. Surely she has to end in in Wentworth somehow? Lesley Baker makes a return appearance as a different character to the one she played in 1979. This time she's involved in the last few episodes with Maxine Daniels (Lisa Crittenden). Look out for Louise Siversen who pops up as a different character to her later top dog Lou Kelly. Julia Blake pops up briefly too. Previously seen in 1981 episodes as Evelyn Randall.

New prisoners include Randi Goodlove (Zoe Bertram), Sonia Stevens (Tina Bursill), Cass Parker (Babs McMillan), Minnie Donovan (Wendy Playfair) and Bobbie Mitchell (Maxine Klibingaitis). On the officers side we see Joan and her LSD trip! Meg Morris (Elspeth Ballantyne) has problems with the girl engaged to her son Marty (Andrew McKaige) and an new officer David Bridges (David Waters) arrives. Ann's son Paul (Paul Newman) also has problems too.

Originally screened between October 1989 and January 1990 on their first UK run in the Midlands, and from 1992 onwards in other parts of the UK, these episodes are great fun to watch. Sadly Australian soaps these days aren't made the same way as they were back in 1983.",1340236800,,1999,5.0120481927710845
