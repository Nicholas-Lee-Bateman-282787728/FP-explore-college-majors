I read the book a couple of years ago and recently re-read it. As I looked it up, I found a film had been made-- I didn't know about it-- so I immediately purchased a copy.

If you haven't read the book, you must. And, this time, reading the book first is probably a good choice.

I'm baffled that some seem to think the ending was unclear. I think it was very clear. However, I don't want to include any spoilers here. It's exactly as it seems to be. Exactly. So, if you're confused and looking for a hidden meaning, you won't find one. It's exactly as the main character understands it to be at the very end.

The movie starts out with Marc asking his wife, Agnes, if he should shave his mustache. He does, and she doesn't notice. As a matter of fact, nobody notices. When he confronts his wife and friends, they insist that he has not had a mustache for at least 15 years. Obviously, somebody is either lying or going crazy. He is suspicious of his wife and friends for quite a while, but then begins to believe that they are indeed telling the truth, and he is somewhat removed from reality. Again, however, he starts distrusting his wife, since strangers recognize his mustache in older pictures.

Who is telling the truth? Who is insane? The film begins with us clearly seeing Marc's mustache. We also clearly see the hairs he trims, the hairs he washes away in the tub, and the hairs he washes away in his shaving tray. We watch him complete his entire shaving ritual-- first using shaving scissors, then an old-fashioned razor. We see everything through Marc's eyes. We meet his Serge and his wife. We hear Agnes talk about going to Marc's parents for lunch. What is real and what isn't?

Both Vincent Lindon and Emmanuelle Devos do a perfect job here. There isn't constant chatter or dialogue and nuances are delivered through subtle expression. They are both so wonderful-- Lindon in particular.

This movie is not about middle aged angst and it's not about a marriage falling apart. And, this is not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination, although, like life, there might be some time you find yourself laughing a bit-- but it's due to the absurdity of the situation and the empathy the characters inspire.

The music is gorgeous and the cinematography beautiful. This is very much recommended.

Note: The ending here is different from the book. The book's ending is a stunner. When I was finished, I just sat there wide-eyed-- not believing what I just finished reading. I re-read the last few pages because it was so unbelievably shocking.

That ending definitely wouldn't have worked here. At the end of the film, I was almost praying I wouldn't have to see what I read in the book. It might have worked visually, but I doubted that it would. Carrere made the right choice here when deciding to change the ending. Again, if you read the book, you wouldn't wonder at all who was right all along or if one of the characters were truly crazy. There is no ambiguity in the book. However, there's no ambiguity here, either. It just hits you with a half a ton of bricks rather than a full ton. Just make sure you realize that the main character understands the truth at the end, and you will understand, too.",1199836800,,3277,4.548387096774194
8149137,5,B000J3YH4I,"Marc (an unsettling, often whacked-out performance by Vincent Lindon) and his wife Agnes (quietly sane but maybe conniving, maybe not Emmanuelle Devos) are getting ready for an evening out with Agnes' ex-husband Serge (Mathieu Amalric) and his new wife. As a joke Marc shaves off his moustache while bathing and of course, naturally expects Agnes, Serge and the next day his fellow workers and the man at the Espresso stand to notice. But no one does. In fact, Agnes tells him he never had a moustache though Marc finds photos from a trip to Bali with Agnes...moustache squarely on his upper lip. The photos disappear before Marc can show them to Agnes and when he asks her about them, she has no recollection of a trip to Bali. And so it goes.
Director Emmanuel Carrere, who also wrote the screenplay based upon his novel has fashioned an enigmatic though thoroughly fascinating film: What is Really Going On Here? ""La Moustache"" never really answers that question: nothing is spelled out, made crystal clear. Is it about the complacency that sets in between partners after a few years: a complacency in which they fail to notice any kind of small change in or on each other? Maybe.
Directed and written by men, ""La Moustache"" has a lot to do with Men's hatred of the drudgery of shaving daily...Marc quits shaving for an extended period of time and never appears happier. It's not surprising that the Men's Fashion Industry pushes the unshaven look as a desirable, virile, macho look: we are all open to anything that saves us from shaving daily.
At times perplexing, confusing, witty yet always intelligent, ""La Moustache"" never fails to hold your interest...though you will be hard pressed to say what it all means. And maybe that is the point.",1159488000,4,1748,4.810631229235881
