(6.0) The Commissioner (UK/Germany/Begium/USA-1998) - John Hurt/Rosana Pastor/Alice Krige/Armin Mueller-Stahl/Simon Chandler/David Morrissey/James Faulkner/Alan MacNaughton",1299628800,,703,6.378947368421053
8629090,5,B0001FXP3I,"Great acting all around make this intriguing political thriller altogether believable. This is not merely a one-dimensional story of corruption within the higher circles of European government and international big business. Rather, its a nuanced, layered gem of plot-twists within plot-twists--but at just the right balance. That is, its just complex enough to keep you thinking and surprised throughout, but also transparent enough to make sense and come together. If you want a high-gadget, violence-and-action filled pop movie, this is not for you. But if you want a highly intelligent, entertaining and even enlightening political thriller, this is for you. It makes most other comparable thrillers seem superficial in comparison.",1147737600,6,735,5.6909090909090905
