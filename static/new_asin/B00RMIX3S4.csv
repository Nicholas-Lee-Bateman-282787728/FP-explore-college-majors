8695563,4,B00RMIX3S4,"This movie, made in New York around 1946, is short on plot but extremely worth seeing for anyone interested in Surrealist art and experimental film. It includes segments from some of the biggest names in the field, including Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, and Alexander Calder (and even two men known primarily as composers, John Cage and Darius Milhaud). Its overall director was Hans Richter, a pioneer of experimental film connected with the Dada movement, a predecessor to Surrealism. I was delighted to discover that it had finally been issued on DVD (Amazon says there was a 2006 version, but I didn't see it when I looked in 2011). The restoration isn't Criterion-level, but were lucky to have the piece at all.

The story, such as it is, centers on a down-on-his-luck fellow named Joe, who discovers that he has the power to see peoples dreamsor the dreams they wish they could have, or somethingand that they will pay him handsomely for the privilege, thus solving his financial problems. He sets up an office, more or less like a psychiatrist, and is deluged with clients. The sequences that follow, each by a different Surrealist artist, are supposedly the clients dreams, ending with Joes own dream.

The eight dream sequences vary quite a lot in interest (to my eye, at least) and relevance to the characters who are supposedly having the dreams; frankly, I think some of Joes clients, such as the accountants wife, should demand their money back. Theyre all worth watching, however, just to see what the various artists do with them. Some sequences are in color, others in black and white; some have dialogue or voice-over, others only music; some have a plot of sorts, others are strictly abstract. In my opinion, the best sequences are the first one (the accountants dream), by Max Ernst, which includes some wonderful imagery and a cameo appearance by Ernst himself as a sort of psychopomp/spirit guide (the older man with the silver hair), and the last one, Joes dream. Get this and see what you make of it!",1456099200,,2030,4.830459770114943
8695564,4,B00RMIX3S4,"I'm sure this was made on a small budget and watching it today, it is sort of dated. The transfer is okay. But it is definitely worth buying for the abundance of talent involved. Most of the segments are astonishing. I had never heard of Libby Holman prior to this and reading about her life was a revelation.",1454025600,,309,4.344827586206897
