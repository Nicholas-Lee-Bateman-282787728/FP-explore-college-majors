1193816,5,B000006GDQ,"Having seen this movie in a theater some 35 years ago, I am glad I now have the DVD in my collection.  This is the kind of cops and robbers caper that does not involve breaking, entering,
using explosives or taking a platoon of hostages to accomplish the objective.  Would you believe it only took just one woman and two men to successfully remove $12 billion in uncut diamonds from what was a virtual fortress?  Surrounded by thick steel impervious to a 75mm cannon shell, the vault where the diamonds were stored and the building that housed the world's largest
clearing house for gems were not open to the public. In fact the activities of each of the handful of long time employees were carefully monitored by armed guards who addressed each of
these men (this place apparently employed no women) by their last names.

The heist was craftily and successfully carried out without a single gunshot fired.  Okay, one of the accomplices who remained in the vault until the theft was discovered collapses and dies.
The character played by James Mason was only a few months short of gaining full retirement benefits. But the management of 11 Harrowhouse would not grant him that exemption since he
would be dead from an incurable disease much sooner. Hence he could not turn down an offer from the masterminds of the robbery for a small cut of the take. All he had to do was to
unscrew the plate that covered the electric socket next to his desk and watch for a pair of cockroaches.

The way this movie ends is simply outrageous.  Charles Grodin as the reluctant thief, Candice Bergen as a wealthy but too youthful to be a widow, James Mason
as the inside man,  John Gielgud as the stiff and stuffy head of the clearinghouse and Trevor Howard as a war hero and an oil baron who took pleasure in going after those who crossed
his path make up an interesting cast of American and English actors.

Best line in the movie: ""I ate the inventory.""

I give 11 Harrowhouse 5 stars.",1301011200,2,1971,4.558073654390935
1193817,5,B000006GDQ,"For as long as the dvd was available as a consumer product i have wanted this magnificent film, 11 Harrowhouse. I admit to buying a dvd transferred from a video and one from a laserdisc,so when the official dvd arrived i was hoping for the best.
 The dvd released by Shout is superb. Excellent detail,colour rendition and very light grain.(The dnr has not smashed detail).Audio is clear and whilst not a 5.1,dts mix it is just fine. For the record the audio contains the voice over from Charles Grodin. Unbeknown to me there is a version without it.",1297296000,8,549,4.6020408163265305
1193818,5,B000006GDQ,"""11 Harrowhouse"" is that rare bird-a unique and intelligent caper film.  The heist itself isn't anything great but it's the little fluorishes in the film that make it special.  The film emphasizes character even though it contains it's fair share of action and droll comedy.  Normally I don't like voice-over narration because it usually reiterates the obvious.  Charles Grodin's, however, is the exception to the rule because not only does it serve as a greek chorus to what's happening onscreen but adds flavor to the action.  The ensemble cast is universally excellent.  Candice Bergen at the time wasn't taken that seriously as an actress but more than holds her own with her heavyweight co-stars.  I particularly liked James Mason's understated turn as a disgruntled employee of the diamond exchange that Grodin is planning to rob.  Stones fans should note that his character's name is Charlie Watts.  I stumbled upon this film by happenstance-Amazon was offering it in conjunction with ""Lucky Lady"".  I will state emphatically that ""11 Harrowhouse"" is a happy accident.",1296604800,3,1075,5.1976744186046515
1193819,5,B000006GDQ,"I own this movie on Laserdisc. I originally saw it in the theater in 1974. The mood and attitude of most people (as opposed to the fringe) in the late 60's early 70's is perfectly captured with great wit and charm. Sure, it is about taking on ""the man"" but only under some duress, though feeling as if it was more or less on a lark, and with great humor. Like M.A.S.H. it is irreverent, casual and full of attitude. Grodin's inner monologue is heard throughout the film and it is very entertaining, drawing you into the film as if you were a confidante of this modest, average Joe, with hidden talents. It is part heist, part mystery and part farce. It was very sophisticated for the day, and that probably explains its poor showing at the box office as it may have been too smart for the average bear. James Mason plays an extremely interesting character, and John Gielgud the smug and superior ""man"" you love to hate, Trevor Howard is the bigger than life wealthy scoundrel, and Candice Bergen is extremely charming as the perfect girlfriend/partner/accomplice we would all love to have. A subtle but interesting undercurrent for the time is that the wealthy magnate's feminine companion is apparently a closet lesbian who comes to the rescue. This is a very unique and memorable movie for those who had the rare opportunity to see it. Perhaps it will become available on Blue-ray at some point.",1264723200,2,1397,4.659919028340081
1193820,4,B000006GDQ,"This is a ""new generation"" spy caper, with Charles Grodin (who co-wrote the screenplay and narrates) as a Dustin Hoffman, Graduate-era slacker low-level diamond broker who falls into an elaborate plot to steal diamonds from a massive London diamond conglomerate led by John Gieglud.  Grodin's partner-in-crime is a Carnaby Street, freewheeling ""new age"" woman played by Candice Bergen, in striking, mod clothes -- who drives race cars and service trucks equally and with great skill.

Filmed in England, with a decidedly ""English"" feel, this is a thoroughly enjoyable spy caper, with a smart sense of humor and stylish direction, set design, and music.  In fact, the music -- also mod, Brit, and hip -- is one of the highlights.  Add James Mason and the great Trevor Howard and you have an overlooked gem of a film, eagerly waiting a decent DVD re-release.

Fox, what are you waiting for?",1163980800,8,888,4.972972972972973
1193821,5,B000006GDQ,"Update: Thankfully, a DVD has been released for this movie in the United States so it's finally part of my DVD collection.

I have long been a fan of this entertaining 1970s caper movie and so, even though I am a DVD devotee, I had no qualms about picking up a VHS copy.  Though, a region-free DVD player comes in handy for movies like THE FOURTH PROTOCOL, HIGH ROAD TO CHINA, WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL and SILVER BEARS, I have yet to find a region where this movie is released.

However I do have a qualm. It appears that the quirky dry humor laden internal commentary by the lead Charles Grodin is missing from this VHS tape. This is an essential part of what makes this movie so engaging because  although this movie is not filmed strictly as a comedy (except for the last 20 minutes or so), Grodins commentary kept the atmosphere  light and  carefree even in the moments of high-tension.

This movie also benefits from a truly amazing high-caliber cast. Featured alongside Grodin is Candice Bergen (later to find fame as Murphy Brown), James Mason, Trevor Howard and Sir John Gielgud. Given this cast and the clever humor and plot it really is astounding that this movie has yet to find a DVD release.

The movie centers around small-time diamond trader Howard R. Chesser who suddenly finds himself negotiating a million-pound deal (a lot more in 1974 than it sounds  today). Treated with contempt by the Diamond Exchange located at 11 Harrowhouse (which carefully controls the flow of diamonds and stockpiles tons of them in order to maintain their value), Chesser jumps at the chance to snub his nose at the Exchange and particularly its snobbish Director Meecham (played by Gielgud).

Financing the deal is the multi-millionaire Clyde Massey (played by Trevor Howard), who wants a large diamond to be named ""The Massey."" However, things do not go according to plan and when Chesser is robbed of the diamond on his return from getting it cut he finds himself blackmailed by Massey into engineering the theft of all four tons of diamonds stockpiled at the Exchange.  With the help of his free-spirited girlfriend Maren (Bergen), the gravely ill employee at the Exchange named Watts (played by Mason) and a giant vacuum hose the three manage to literally suck up all the diamonds through the wiring system. It's an ingenious plot and I liked the line of commentary from Grodin. As he sits on the roof hearing the stones going through the hose he ponders what the hourly rate might be for work like this.

Yet, all is not as it seems. And the fact that there is still a half-hour of movie left after the theft is completed should tell you that a bigger and more rousing climax is approaching, and does it ever with gun-toting men on horseback and cars chasing Chesser and Maren through the English countryside.

All in all this is a thoroughly entertaining movie and much better than some other titles that have already seen a DVD release. Come on Fox, give us this movie in our favorite format.",1150329600,13,2994,4.68
1193822,5,B000006GDQ,"It's a shame to think of how many good movies have been made, only to come to this: no showings on TV, no DVD, and just a few used VHS tapes on the secondary market.  Such is the case for 11 Harrowhouse (AKA Anything for Love (USA) (TV title), Fast Fortune).

1974 May have come and gone, but this movie still makes for engaging entertainment.  Fully 4 tons of diamonds are stolen from the leading firm in London, and the scenario is more than plausible.  Bergen and Grodin offer solid performances, and the addition of John Gielgud (the Butler in Arthur) ensures a quality product.

At 8 PM, I pressed play expecting to stop at 9 for ABC's Desperate Housewives... It was 9:30 before I suddenly remembered to stop.  Soon it became clear the intermission was unnecessary; this movie beats modern television hands down.",1128816000,8,817,4.638888888888889
1193823,4,B000006GDQ,"I first saw this film on TV, in which the funniest thing was a retrospective voice-over commentary by Chesser (Charles Grodin's character) about the whole affair. The film is still good, but it was SO much better with the commentary. It seems like it has something missing now. I have put the tape I bought in a dusty cupboard and will watch the ancient taped TV version until the publishers think about releasing the better version.",1122163200,18,433,4.7105263157894735

This DVD makes for a fine companion to the novel.",1403222400,,304,4.509090909090909
1193877,5,B000006GDQ,"I've always enjoyed films dealing with grand larceny schemes, and this one ranks right up there with Rififi, Topkapi, and so many others, in my estimation.  Charles Grodin was relatively unknown at the time this movie was produced, but his performance proved to be  memorable, for which reason I recently chose to acquire the dvd.  The background dialogue is very well handled and the plot moves along smoothly.  James Mason, Trevor Howard, and Candice Bergen contribute adequately to a memorable plot.  It's worth having on hand for pleasant watching from time to time.",1366675200,,570,5.086021505376344

1193880,2,B000006GDQ,"After reading 11 Harrowhouse by Gerald A. Browne, I was anxious to see the film.  If I hadn't read the book, there is no way I would have known or cared what was going on on screen.  The adaptation into the film was done so poorly it is a true shame.  Charles Grodin in no way represented my idea of Chesser - not by any stretch of the imagination.  And not only did Candice Bergen illustrate the polar opposite personality to that of Marin in the book; but to watch her twist and roil her way through her idea of ""acting"" was both boring and painful at the same time.  Please, folks, read the book.  Steer clear of the movie.",1346716800,,626,4.175
1193881,5,B000006GDQ,"Excellent movie - we have not been able to get it before as it is not available everywhere - big fan of Charles Grodin! (Midnight Run  Dave).It also has other great actors - Candice Bergen, James Mason.",1317254400,,202,4.45945945945946
1193882,2,B000006GDQ,"Most of the reviews of this movie seem to be quite positive, so my take on it will probably surprise previous reviewers. I found the movie to be one of the absolute worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen. The book was absolutely spellbinding, but the movie has little in common with the book other than the name and the same basic premise, stealing diamonds. The tone of the book was dark and full of drama and adventure. The tone of the movie was light, nearly comedic. Plus who would ever believe Charles Grodin as a diamond thief or even a diamond dealer. When I first read the book in 1973, I pictured Paul Newman as Chesser. Grodin was a substantial let down. James Mason was the only bit of great casting. Candace Bergan was pretty good, but she would have been better in the role had it been truer to the book. I really can't recommend this film. I can highly recommend the book. Read the book first, then if you must, watch the movie. You will see what I mean. Also, the surprise twist at the end of the book is nowhere to be found in the movie, which ends in a sort of madcap chase scene that reminded me of the final scene in ""The Pink Panther."" But it was done much better in PP. I had really looked forward to the movie version of this book, but found it totally lacking.",1315267200,,1289,4.222672064777328
1193883,5,B000006GDQ,"Well. Let me start out by saying that I first saw this film as a child and instantly fell in love with everything about it. I wanted to be the Charles Grodin character, I wanted the Dino Candace Bergen drove, I loved everything about the film. Because of that for years I've tried to find it on DVD without succss. I read about how the narrative track had been removed and that was a great disappointment because that is a key part of the film. So I was surprised and intrigued to see this DVD on the market. I bought it hoping that it had all of the elements of the original film because I wanted to share this gem with my spouse. I am so glad that I bought it. It is just as I remember it and now I can watch as much as I want. It's so great to be able to have this classic in our collection the way I remember it. It was fun then and it is fun now. I think anyone who saw the original will be pleased with this dvd....",1302307200,4,921,3.904255319148936
