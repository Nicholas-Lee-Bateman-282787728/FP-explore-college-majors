8608984,2,B00ESLRD02,"We received season 4 with a region code ""2"". (Probably the UK) We are UNABLE to play this in our DVD player.  We are very unhappy with not be able to speak with some one about this problem.  Everything is done by computer.  So now what??  Even our order information does not show up in their History file.  Who can help us?",1427328000,,323,4.145161290322581

8608986,5,B00ESLRD02,"I'm so excited to have these seasons back. I'd watched them all at least 3 times, then thoughtlessly gave them away so I'd have more room in my dvd drawers. Then, of course, a few years later I tried to replace them and couldn't. I'm delighted with the quality of these!",1398556800,,270,4.313725490196078
8608987,5,B00ESLRD02,"We would rush home to watch the latest show when this TV show first appeared. The DVDs we purchased were PAL versions, but they played fine on our Blu-Ray Player. They keep coming out with the additional seasons and I plan to see them all. LA Law is one of the few shows that even though it is over 20 years old it is still relevant and fun. Not to be missed. Enjoy!",1389484800,4,366,4.027397260273973
8608988,5,B00ESLRD02,"For those of you wondering if these DVDs will play on US DVD players, the answer is YES!  I bought the first 3 seasons and now this one.  Despite the fact that Region 2 is on the box, all discs play perfectly on my BluRay player as well as on my older DVD player.  The quality is normal TV quality, not HD.  I know there are many others out there who have been anxiously awaiting this series on DVD.  I can hardly wait for Season 5 now!  Buy with confidence and enjoy!",1379116800,11,468,4.032608695652174
