I finished the 8 episodes in one sitting, and I just can't wait for season 2.",1450569600,,251,4.361702127659575
7045451,5,B00UIKAYDA,"Wonderful show for people 20 - 40 years of age. Seriously, this is the reason I love HBO. They'll give a show about real people a chance. Super well done. Explores a lot of themes surrounding parenting, marriage, friendship, etc. My wife and I loved it and hope for more shows in this vein!",1433203200,3,290,4.388888888888889

8706959,5,B00UIKAYDA,"I have DIRECTV, one weekend we had free HBO, I recorded about 5 of episodes, there are cute, funny an very much so down to Earth real. Its a show that you can watch over & over again, after I saw the few that I recorded I ordered the Frist season.",1466208000,,247,3.8627450980392157

8706961,5,B00UIKAYDA,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this series!  Great characters!  Such poignant stories! And HBO cancels it?? C'mon HBO, rethink this terrible decision!!",1460764800,,137,5.8
8706962,1,B00UIKAYDA,"I am really surprised how this c*** got sales pitched.  The first episode starts with the husband jerking off while watching his wife's panties.  Half an hour late it is the turn of his wife's.

And this is supposed to be funny.  Not one scene made me laugh or smile.

The second episode ?  I cannot stay, because the the garbage truck had picked it for me.

On one of the spectrum is the Trump maniacs and on the other side we got this.",1459468800,,437,4.130952380952381
8706963,5,B00UIKAYDA,My new favorite show. The four main characters are so real and relatable. Excellent cast. Another gem by the Duplass brothers.,1457222400,,126,5.0476190476190474
8706964,2,B00UIKAYDA,Two stars for the actresses playing Tina and Michelle. The female characters are interesting.  They definately do not look or act like sisters. Brent is a really lame jerk and his friend kind of a sad sack. The story starts as a comedy but then becomes more serious and also sort of stupid. SoCal culture at its nadir.,1457049600,,318,4.482758620689655
8706965,5,B00UIKAYDA,"I just binge-watched the entire season and really enjoyed it.  Nice to have a (mostly) realistic grown-up show, not too cutesy and not focused on the kids.  The actors worked well together as the characters they play.  Love the setting of LA and waiting for Season 2!",1456790400,,267,4.638297872340425
8706966,4,B00UIKAYDA,An enjoyable show if you can get past wanting to punch the Duplass character in the face. I almost couldn't. But I guess he's working on it.,1456531200,,140,4.222222222222222
