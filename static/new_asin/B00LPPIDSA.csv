6498502,1,B00LPPIDSA,The final season is garbage.,1408838400,8,28,4.8
6498503,5,B00LPPIDSA,"What will my Sunday evenings look like at dusk? Considering my inherent discomfort with horror art, who knew that ""True Blood"" would become one of my all time favorite series? But when the vampires are as sexy as Bill, shape shifters as handsome as Sam, superb acting from Anna Pacquin, Stephen Moyer, Ryan Kwanten, Nelsan Ellis, etc. The writers gave their best each week to each and every episode.
Not all plot twists were fulfilling like Mary Ann, the maenad, the witch, the too hyped performance from Russell......but the undeniable love between Bill and Sookie kept my heart beating, Hoyt and Jessica falling in love and then the heartbreak Hoyt experienced when Jessica turned away only to be reunited in this final season as they competed for the most romantic couple with Bill and Sookie. Lafayette and Tara kept the series moving with fun and animated performances. I could go on and on.
HBO keeps me captivated with ""Oz"", ""Six Feet Under"", ""Hung"", ""Treme"", etc.
Thanks to Alan Ball for a rare long standing series with closure.",1408838400,20,1037,4.864406779661017
6498504,3,B00LPPIDSA,"Does the blood stained tear mean they are turning Sookie into a vampire?  LOL - I wouldn't be surprised the way this season is going... I have been sooooooo disappointed by this last and final season.  However, considering how many BAD and I mean BAD story lines they had to clear up from the last few seasons, it could have been a lot worse.  I haven't understood why they killed Tara off then brought her back to find a gun???  Please, someone smarter than I please explain that one to me?????",1408320000,5,495,4.406593406593407

6498506,3,B00LPPIDSA,"When True Blood began it was a compelling show with morally ambiguous characters and a plot that wasn't afraid to take risks. Each season seemed to get better and better, with deeper and more complex villains and stories.

Sadly, that show is no longer around. The writers no longer seem to know what they want to with either the characters, or the general plot. Whenever they decide they want to force a new ""twist"" down our throat, they either kill of a random side character, or throw two random people together in an extremely forced romance, only to have them separate again by the beginning of the next season.

Plus the show is generally trying too hard the past few seasons to be Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When I heard that they were planning on bringing the series back to its roots for the final season, I was at first hopeful, but quickly found myself disappointed. The interpersonal relationships have gone from artificial, to laughably absurd. Andy and Jessica have a buddy cop type adventure and all the sudden bygones are bygones, Sookeh and Beel are back, Jason and Jessica are bouncing off each other again, etc etc. I won't even get into the stupid ghost Tara story. And the big villain of the final season? Sarah Newlin and the Yakuza. Yes really.

Thus far the final season of True Blood has been one disappointment after another, and I doubt that the last two episodes are going to save it. The three stars I gave it are for the three brilliant seasons that the show started with, everything after that you can either skip, or go on Netflix and watch the better version. It's called Buffy the Vampire Slayer.",1406073600,34,1629,4.629757785467128

6498514,5,B00LPPIDSA,True Blood season 7 is just another great HBO installment mini-series that closed the chapter of a Excellent series that ran for 7 years.

6498517,5,B00LPPIDSA,"I just finished binge watching all seven seasons of ""True Blood"" When it first came on HBO I did not watch it (I didn't have the cable channel) I saw  the show come up on my recommendations for Amazon Prime. I love vampires and was curious about this show. I wanted to see if this series shed some new ideas about vampire lore. I don't want to spoil the show, but I was surprised by the developments.  About how different supernatural creatures interacted with the humans.

 I have to say that seasons 5, 6, and 7 were great. I do not get why everybody said these were the worst. In my opinion, season 1 was awful. I really had to force myself to get into the show. Not much was going on, Just Bill and Sookie romance. Then as the show progressed and the universe of supernatural characters expanded, it got so much better. The show did not hook me until season 4. The show became much darker and I think a lot of fans were disappointed that not everybody got a happy ending.  I think that is why everybody hated season 7 the most. It was sad, but people need to realize that not everybody gets a perfect happy ending. I enjoyed this show and I would recommend it to anybody who loves vampires and wants a different take on it than Twilight.",1528156800,,1241,4.286324786324786

6498544,4,B00LPPIDSA,"To me True Blood Season 7 was still overall very enjoyable to it's die hardcore fans.  While other fans go on to say they are disappointed of how it ended, I see the ending as the right way to end the series.  The series as a whole I savor every bit of it season after season, I only gave it a four star rating because of how they killed certain characters (no spoilers).  I agree with a bonus feature they had on the final season, great writing, great actors, and great fans make for a very fun show to watch threw the years, Alan Ball created a masterpiece with this show.  Any true fan of drama, action, suspense thrillers, plus of course horror will savor each and every single season of this show, might end up yelling at the screen for the final season on a few episodes but well worth it in the end.",1515283200,,806,4.180645161290323

6498548,3,B00LPPIDSA,"The first three season were very entertaining, ....and then everything turned to lazy garbage in Season 4.  Suddenly, everyone had some sort of supernatural power and it became like a show made for the WB network.  Season 5 returned with some of the humor.  Pam, in particular had the best lines.  By Season 6 they didn't know where to take the story, other than multiple plot lines culminating in ""war"".

6498551,4,B00LPPIDSA,"This was a great series but I really thought they were going to end it by having Sookie use her light to kill Bill which in turn would actually just kill off the vampire side of him which could have explained why she was able to hear him at the end.

6498590,5,B00LPPIDSA,"Great story retelling of vampire cannon. Some scenes I laughed out loud they were so wonderfully written and performed. One thing I do wish is that there were less gratuitous sex scenes. At first its tantalizing, but with any exciting thing it loses it's effect if thrown in your face too often, like the F-bombs dropping nearly every other word you think they're having a competition for the Guiness Book of World Records for the most times the F-bomb is said in the dialogue. It got to be funny. One could get blind drunk having a drinking game with that one word alone. I felt let down by season four that Bill and Sookie were astranged from each other after such a strong start, but I stayed with the show and hung in there just because I wanted to see it end well. I've binge watched it and now am on season 7 and Sookie still appears to be sleeping her way through the men in the show. Whaaat happened writers??? I'm sticking it out, though, through episode 2 of season 7, but I don't hold out much hope. The ending better have them both smiling happily married with 7 vampire/faerie hybrids.
Well...I just finished the laat episode of season 7 and it did wrap itself up in a nice big red bow, didn't it. I'm just so sad that Bill and Sookie didn't get their happy ending.

6498604,1,B00LPPIDSA,Terrible Season...just Terrible. I don't know if that was because of the many unanswered questions I was left with once I finished the season or the fact that all of my favorite characters were brought to an abrupt end.....ugh,1492560000,2,226,4.82051282051282
6498605,5,B00LPPIDSA,"Well I just finished watching True Blood from start to finish, all 7 seasons over the last month or so. I have to say, for all those folks out there that thought the last few seasons were a waste of time, watch it from start to finish over the course of a month or so where you can binge watch it some nights and an episode here and there when life it just too busy. It told a story as a whole. The last three episodes broke my heart to pieces. I now know why so many fans out there were just that... total fans. Sure some bits were a bit strange but we are talking about a show about a small town where they have vampires, shape shifters, fairies, werewolves and god only knows what else all trying to get along. When you watch a show like this, as it was originally presented, one episode every week and then have to wait a year to see the next season you loose some of the traction and even interest but watching it fully like this was a treat that I'm glad I got to experience. I really hope they eventually release a blue ray package with all 7 seasons as I will gladly add this to my collection.",1491696000,24,1101,4.055045871559633

6498620,5,B00LPPIDSA,"There main thing that really bothered me was the offscreen death of a major character, and the romance for the side characters was a little too happy, and too frequent. I think the scene transitions could have been much better. And, maybe it was a stylistic choice but there were some grainy scenes.

Still this series turned out much better than I expected, and I enjoyed the music and the main character, very much. I heard the final season was bad, but I liked it a lot. Much better than the middle seasons where a lot of the fairy shenanigans fell flat for me, along with the origins of vampires. Still it was clever in handling life saving plot devices for main characters by foreshadowing in lesser characters. The show had its flaws but they weren't enough to detract me from thoroughly enjoying the show.",1488153600,,812,4.6

Without being too specific, it's almost as if the writers (at the beginning of season 7), had planned on making a season 8. But suddenly decided during the last few episodes to end everything on the last 2 episodes. The entirety of season 7 could have been broken down into a good 3 episodes. (Teaser)..Everything that happens to them, and everyone that you think would end up together...don't. With the exception of ONE couple! And that happens during the very last episode as well!

Overall, I am confused about the entire series. I thoroughly enjoyed watching every season. Even though at a few points it went way off into left field.. I still didn't get bored enough to give up on it. So I guess that means something..",1483833600,,894,4.484662576687117

6498704,3,B00LPPIDSA,"Final season: SPOILER ALERT as I must vent. Tara's demise is sudden & the rest of her storyline is sadly pointless. Eric was last seen human combusting on a mountain top in season 6 finale. Yet, In season 7 Eric never shares how he contracted anything but only says he traveled a lot. Alcide demise was just as sudden as Tara's. Sam is rarely in the season except to depart. Jason, Hoyt & Jessica love triangle does a 180. Why didn't Adilyn age anymore throughout the season? I thought that would've severed the possibility of her & her step brothers relations. Why didn't Pam have a visceral reaction to Tara's demise? Bill never liked being a vampire so true death for him was sad yet appreciated. Will Arlene ever be able to concemate her new relationship with hep V? So, if new blood/Sarah Newlinn is the antidote for hep V in vampires, what's the antidote for humans? Maybe Hep V is meant to keep human & vampire relationships at bay.

6498772,3,B00LPPIDSA,"SPOILER:

The whole point of Sookie being with vampires, well, one of them, is that she can't read their mind.  She can't date human males because SHE can read their mind and who wants to, or can be in, a relationship where you can read someone's mind all the time?  BUT at the end....it looks like she's Suzy Homemaker, pregnant and with a human male?  It didn't make sense.  Like she got the normal life she always wanted, but could never get, because she could read minds....and we're back to the beginning?

And the way things conveniently happened so certain couples could get and stay together, and at the end, it's like one big family dinner.  OK, happy ending for some characters and just an ending for others.",1478649600,,718,4.5625

6498782,3,B00LPPIDSA,First off let me say that I LOVED the Sookie Stackhouse books; all of them!  I watched the first two seasons of True Blood only.  The HBO series was not like the books.  Maybe the outline of the HBO series was similiar but that's about it.  This was the finale; it was just okay.  I guess you either loved the HBO version or hated it.,1477699200,,334,4.076923076923077
6498783,5,B00LPPIDSA,"I was hesitant to watch the final season of True Blood, because I dreaded the possibility that they would kill off all of my favorite characters.

6498790,3,B00LPPIDSA,Seriously Amazon your prices are steep for a single episode! I shelled out too much money to watch Season 7 which wasn't nearly as good as the other seasons. It is still True Blood though and it kept me coming back for more to see what happened. Waiting 2 years to watch the show finale seemed disappointing until I watched the last episode of the series and realized that was the true disappointment.,1476662400,,401,4.506849315068493

After watching season 7, I really, really wish the show had stopped with season 6. I could deal with that better. Season 7 was such a disappointment. It wasn't the plot and certainly not the actors I had grown to love. The problem was that, from episode 1 of this final season, the show was lacking the quirky writing and pacing from previous seasons. Character dialogue seemed mostly uncharacteristic, and the strange camera angles and directing didn't work well with this type of show (no need for overly dramatic closeups and pauses). It's almost like they tried to cross a daytime soap with CSI--which is okay, I guess, if you like that sort of thing. The problem is that we had 5-1/2 to 6 seasons of something completely different. Season 7 feels like an afterthought, a poor attempt to wrap it up, and what's worse, they could have done the entire season in one episode. I watched seasons 1 thru 6 via my Amazon Prime account, so my final thought for season 7...I can't believe I paid good money for that.",1469750400,14,1045,4.5638297872340425

However, I let go of whatever expectations I had and stayed open to whatever was coming, and this last season actually brought it all full-circle for me and gave the show a superior, deeper dimension. That's why instead of saying ""this was one of the most enjoyable TV shows I've ever seen"" I can now say ""this is one of the BEST TV shows I've ever seen"".

6498955,3,B00LPPIDSA,The story was interesting and the production was well cast and acted. I did tire of many of the main characters becoming gay after several weeks. Also the studios political leanings would have been best omitted. I realize that as an HBO production they feel the need to be edgy but ultimately it did not fit into the backstory and does not add anything of benefit. The series loses steam after season 5.

Not only have we watched every season and every show we have also read or listened to every book and audio book written by Charlaine Harris. While we are great fans of the show I was disappointed with this last season. What should have been a 5 star ending was sadly full of top characters dying and a lot of naked sex scenes. It was almost like the writers of the show forgot how to write a good script and dialog and they went for sensationalism and shockers instead.

I won't throw in any spoilers but I could have foreseen a much better ending to the series with less sex, violence and death and more happy endings. I still gave the show 4 stars as I felt it was between a 3.5 and a 4 star but it could have been more satisfying with a different ending to the show.

The cast worked so well together from the very beginning and focused on some great actors than aren't usually paid attention to. There were great surprises, understandable disappointments, but nothing seemed unresolved. I still go back to review the other seasons, especially season 4 with Sookie & Eric because it was so sweet. There were some sweet resolutions in the concluding season 7. I wish they'd gone on a bit more but maybe it would have diluted the strength of the entire series. It was GREAT Prime got the rights to it because I don't have any paid TV & could only see it if we were at a hotel!

I got so wrapped up in this from the very start.  I don't know why; it isn't generally my type of program.  It was available to watch free through Amazon Prime, and so I figured I'd give it a chance.  I often find myself picking random Amazon Prime shows that have multiple seasons available to watch, and then binge!
I laughed more than I probably should have throughout this series.  It was very entertaining.  Some of the characters I completely enjoyed.  I loved seeing how some of them changed and overcame issues.  Some of the characters I wanted to punch in the face!  ;)
The series is not a super deep, or thoughtful one, but it is engaging and entertaining.
One of my favorite parts of the series were the unlikely friendships and the ""family"" mentality.  Regardless of all of the issues going on, when it came down to life or death, the people would come together for greater good.  That was very interesting to me.  There was a unity among ""outsiders"" that makes perfect sense.  Even when your differences are different from others, there is a bonding agent in simply being different.

I hate that it is over, but it ran its course and entertained me for many seasons.  Farewell True Blood!",1464307200,,1237,4.5590909090909095

Death Is Not The End
So, you have Eric, Pam and Ginger standing in the recently inherited video store, and low and behold there are dvds on the shelves.
Plus, there is a sign in the background stating that there are dvds for sale.
This scene is supposed to be taking place in 1986!!
Dvds weren't even invented until 1995, almost ten years later.
In my opinion, it is screw ups like this that make for a cheesy show.
And, it just goes to show you that people in America today do not pay attention to, nor care about, accurately depicting history.

The ending seemed like it was possibly left open enough for a possible spin off if they ever wanted to do one. (Which I would be all for!) I wanted to see Sarah Newlin die before it ended, but I wound up liking what they came up with for her soooooo much more than just simply killing her! Again, it was a definitely worth watching and there were a lot of things I enjoyed about this season, I just wanted something a little bigger to end one of my favorite shows.",1451606400,,598,4.076271186440678

6499220,3,B00LPPIDSA,"True blood got more improbable, as well as more racist, in its last season. We suspended our disbelief for vampires, werewolves, and fairies. But just because vampires came out the coffin you expect US immigration to give the Yakuza some kind of international roaming green card where they get to kill Republicans with impunity? Lol. Although we all enjoyed watching Ted Cruz's face come crashing down.

Also, what happened to our protagonists of color? Lafayette has a good moment in there about ""doesn't he deserve a piece of happiness too?"" But it's really a piece of action that the writers could have given him this season, by not reducing him to flipping his non-hair and serving fruity cocktails to white women. His character arc could have been way longer! He was a favorite who got very little screen time. And whyyyyy Tara??? We hardly got any time to grieve. After all that she did for us in the earlier seasons, we spent ages mourning Terry Bellefleur and all Tara got was a couple tears. At least her mom cared.

And at least Pam and Eric got the happy ending they deserved. Although they became the true definition of evil--a pharmaceutical company.",1443398400,,1163,4.781094527363184

It's sad to see one of my favorite shows end but even more that that they themselves f***** it up for the fans. After the departure of Alan Ball the series slowly went down hill. I know  that if that man stuck with this series till the end that it would have been beautiful and everything we wanted to see. Sure some people probably wouldn't have liked it but still, majority would. Unlike with this finale NO ONE liked it.

I haven't had HBO in years so never got see past Season 4 of True Blood so when I saw it on Amazon Prime, I decided to power watch the entire series...What a let down the finale was!  I loved this show up until Season 6 and even though it was satisfying to see som people (one inparticular) get what they deserve, the whole Sookiie and Bill resolutiion was a awful, disappointing, a complete let-down and totally unbelievable for the characters.  The final dinner scene was awful I absolutely hated it.  Honestly, if I had know the series ended that way I wouldn't have wasted 80+ hours of my life.

The best part was the Eric and Pam resolution who were always my favorite characters anyway.

My advice is the watch to Season 6 and use your imagination on how the series ends - I can almost guarantee it's be better than how it actually ends.",1439164800,5,919,4.370588235294117

But, I was disappointed (to say the least) as to how this series ended. I understand that director's and screen writers don't always want to go the popular route and do ""what is expected of them"" with regards to plots, but the end was so far out of left field I found myself staring at my tablet dumbfounded asking ""Is that is?"" Not only was Season 7 slow, there were a lot of loose ties that were resolved with death or easy answers. And heck, if that's all it took, why not simply make those decisions in the last episode of season 6. I feel like the whole season could have been covered in 2 episodes. I should have listened to my friend's and skipped this season, but as a huge fan I wanted to see it for myself. The only thing I can say to those looking to watch this, skip the beginning episodes and go straight to the last 2-3, you will save yourself a bit of  time and money and not miss anything remotely important.",1438905600,10,1080,4.217391304347826

Charlaine Harris isn't much of a writer - her first 3 books were lighthearted fun that seemed to be more for the Teenie Genre than serious fiction after that I quit reading her garbage!
HBO picked it up , and I give them credit for doing a fairly well done job on screen.
However - they managed to screw it up, too.
Good Ideas , bad writing.
It tried to cover the whole fantasy Genre - everything included.
Great Actors, but the writers really lost it.
Religion got in the way - and I don't care if it's christian, or voodoo, or muslim - it's all crap!
Bill getting killed was not much of a surprise - they really had no place else to go.
Maybe they made him into a vampire jesus in their own minds?

6499319,2,B00LPPIDSA,The plot lines got more and more ridiculous as the show ran on !  I got hooked by season 3 and continued watching until the very end.

I had to buy the book to see what was actually happening in the wnd of the story.",1436745600,,337,3.6944444444444446

6499373,5,B00LPPIDSA,I have always loved Trueblood. I was sad to see the last season come and go but I knew it was time. The story lines were starting to get silly. I didn't like the last episode but that is probably because I envisioned a different ending for Sookie.,1432339200,,247,4.166666666666667

6499376,2,B00LPPIDSA,"The final season was an utter disappointment. A storyline that should never have happened was built up only to be resolved within minutes with a simple decision. When the storyline started, most were ""eh?"" because the characters should have resolved it before it even started. Bill's dilemma and decision made no sense as his actions and beliefs with others contradicted what he wanted. It was just bad. For those of us who have been watching the series, we were going to watch this garbage to the end. Honestly, I'm glad it's over. The t.v. world of Sookie went the same way as the books did. The first 4-5 books kicked tail and then it was obvious the pressures of pushing books out per Charlaine Harris' contract and her lack of creativity to continue with great storylines or a loss of interest was obvious. In this sense the series followed the books. Awesome to mediocre to bad to unbearable.",1432080000,18,898,4.689873417721519

6499389,1,B00LPPIDSA,"This season ruined the entire series for me. I've seen every episode, and this series finale was by far worse than the series finale for Dexter. It is full of plot holes, forced story arcs, and just feels like a waste of time. The writers clearly didn't give a s*** anymore. If the show was this low quality in an earlier season it would have been canceled.

Please save yourself the money, your curiosity will be sorely disappointed. It takes 12 episodes for essentially nothing to happen. There are points where it seems like it will get interesting, but it doesn't.

This is coming from someone who LOVED seasons 1-5. Season 6 wasn't very bad in comparison to this.",1431302400,,668,4.605042016806722

6499391,4,B00LPPIDSA,"Well, gee.  Read some of the negative opinions of disappointed fans.  Yes, I can agree with many of their points of criticism.  But to me, True Blood has always been about Sookie.  This is her story, not Bill's or Eric's or Jason's.  Sookie.  With six seasons of fear, pain, loss, love, suffering, discovery and more emotional hurricanes than any of us could withstand, it was time.  It was time for her to find peace and contentment and human love.  She wasn't getting any younger and had experienced so much betrayal and disappointment, I wanted something better for her.  What attracted everyone to Sookie was not just her fairy blood.  It was her attitude of hopefulness.  Hope.  She just didn't give up, always hoping for something better.  I absolutely love the Thanksgiving scene.  At last.  Not true blood, but true friends and true family, a husband and a baby on the way.  Sharing food and giving thanks for an abundant life.  She could never have experienced this with a vamp.  Bill knew it.  I knew it.  You knew it.  In the end, she had what we should all hope for, a life worth living.",1431129600,,1099,4.590673575129534

6499397,3,B00LPPIDSA,I have all 7 seasons and have suffered through many of them due to the left wing nonsense and poor writing. Season 7 had it's moments with the last 2 episodes being the best of the 10. But all together there was too much emphasis on characters and plotlines that were minor at best. I could not recommend this to anyone. I gave it three stars out of sheer kindness.,1430611200,,365,4.228571428571429

6499404,5,B00LPPIDSA,"The show is graphically and overly sexual (not to my taste). But the rest is a lot of fun. The story is enjoyably outrageous and compelling. (Compelling...oh no!). The actors are great. The show has plenty of scary tension, and a lot of hilarious moments. Very unconventional, so much fun. The treatment of thorny social issues, which I don't think should be thought of as thorny at all, is unique, poignant, tragic, and hysterical. Sometimes matter-of-fact, sometimes in-your-face, always well done. The Southern setting adds a richness that you don't find anywhere else. Not as much Southern humor in the show as in the books, but it kills every time. (Kills...oh no!)

The show has to be viewed in its own right, as it is much different than the books.",1430265600,,755,4.8076923076923075

6499425,2,B00LPPIDSA,"I have been a huge fan of this series from the beginning. I've read all the books, own all of them, including the comic books. I own 4 True Blood T-shirts, a mug, the perfume, and all the DVD box sets- I was heavily invested in this series.
Then Season 7 came along and ruined it all. I found myself waiting weeks to watch a show. The lackluster of each episode didn't make me happy, it left me depressed and questioning what I'd ever seen in the show to begin with.
I hated this season and not just because the outcome was ridiculous, which it was. But the whole plot was idiotic and pointless. Disappointed doesn't even begin to put into words how I felt watching the last season. I guess it goes hand in hand with my last feelings of the books..... they both sucked.

SPOILERS AHEAD

If you love Alcide, stop before you watch this season- He dies.
If you love Bill, stop before you watch this season- He dies too.
If you love Eric and Sookie together- Give it up, because they split and go separate ways. <--- Are you crying yet?
If you are a fan of Tara- Hang it up, she dies and it's fast.
If you hold any hope for a wonderful outcome for any of the characters in this show, don't hold your breath you aren't going to get one.

What you will be left with is an emptiness of unfulfilled TV show love.

Oh, and I guess you could show a bit of smiles for the fact that Hoyt and Jessica reunite and live happily ever after... that's something, right? Bleh!",1428624000,13,1457,4.211469534050179

I see myself as an open minded reader and will even accept Hollywood's ""creative"" way of bringing a book to film. But, wow, was there so much bickering going on at the end that everyone just gave up and just said, ""The hell with it and the viewers too!"" I was really excited to watch this last season.

6499511,5,B00LPPIDSA,"True Blood is an excellently written series. I have watched it since it began, and recently bought this dvd set for my nephew. It is nothing like the Twilight series, and in my experience, people who really love Twilight usually do not care for this series - again, simply because the two are nothing alike. Some of the main characters here (as well as supporting roles) are vampires, but that's not to say this is a show ""about vampires."" This series is really best described as being about the people and goings-on of a small, backwoods Louisiana town where some of the people just happen to be vampires.

As mentioned above, the writing is excellent. One of the best aspects about this series is that it is definitely NOT predictable! Not in the least. You never know where the writers are going to take you...from one episode to the next, or from one season to the next. The character development, story lines, acting, directing, casting and effects are all first rate. Considering that the series has its fair share of killing (although not overly so, and it's certainly not the focus of the show), the series couldn't be called ""dark"" or gory by any means. I also would not call this show necessarily ""violent"" either. (Personally, I don't care for violent shows or movies, and I find this series to be tolerable on the violence scale. It does have killing and blood and bodies and body parts, after all there are vampires in it, but even so, it's done in a way that is not offensive or vulgar.)

There is comedy, drama, action and suspense...and very well choreographed cliff-hangers to end each episode. Despite the blood, death and suspense, the series as a whole is well balanced with comedy and other character's story lines which help keep it from being overly dark. There is a quite a bit of nudity - not raunchy, but tasteful and almost artful. So if you're sensitive to nudity, just be forewarned...or simply cover your eyes during those parts, because the story lines and acting make this series well worth watching. I easily give 5-stars to every season.

Another refreshing bonus is that the episode commentary for every season is also worth watching. The actors, directors and writers actually contribute thoughtful and interesting tidbits that add to the episodes and the series.  It's best to watch the commentaries after you've completed the season because sometimes they accidentally reveal things that happen later in that season.

This series is well worth purchasing.",1424822400,4,2493,4.842723004694836

6499526,2,B00LPPIDSA,"This season is disappointing.  There are many flaws in the writing and the plot-lines have so many holes they are often implausible.  Characters do things which do not make sense based on the people they are.  The writers often resort to the cheesiest and most predictable forms of melodrama.  The story-line is so poorly executed that I am rarely surprised, never delighted and often annoyed.  The actors are still decent, but given the words they are given and the story they have to work with, I don;t know how they could salvage it...
It is as if all the writers of previous seasons have been fired and a bunch of 17 year olds, low on life experience and high on hormones and drama (who have never seen the show as it was before and only got a short synopsis of the characters) were hired to write the last season...I am up to episode 7 and I do not know if I have the will to continue...it feels like a waste.",1424304000,2,914,4.352941176470588

6499532,2,B00LPPIDSA,Sorry I wasted my money. Even worse than season 6. Really - why bother. The last three episodes are devoted to tying everything up in a pretty pink bow of togetherness that has absolutely nothing to do with the scary camp of the first five seasons and even less to do with the books.

I won't tell any ""spoiler"" alerts, but I'm just disappointed with the way everything was handled throughout the CD, especially after the way the finale was hyped, and everyone was made to wait so long for its release.

The one thing that really stands out though is that in the first episode bill says something about ""fangtasia"" having a silly name because puns were big back in the day. The  in season 7, Fangtasias story is told as though it was just opened in the 1980/90s  . For some reason that really bothered me. But the way it came about was pretty ok, just out of freaking no where.

6499571,3,B00LPPIDSA,"I have been a fan of the Southern Vampire books/show for several years.  I stopped watching True Blood at the start of Season 4 after seeing that it was not like book 4 (the best book for Eric/Sookie fans) at all.  So now I am catching up.  In Season 7, everybody looks so old to me compared to when I stopped watching!  I loved seeing the characters again, and I am glad that Sook did not end up with Sam in the TV show.  I have never been a fan of Queen Bill, but I enjoyed Arlene, Lafayette, Tara, Eric, Pam, etc.  Alan Ball really ruined the show with his promotion of Sookie and Bill vs. Sookie and  Eric.  Also I didn't like that every season has to have a big villain in every episode.  However I really liked Mr. Gus, even if the yakuza members were driving lame cars.",1421971200,2,776,4.12

6499582,4,B00LPPIDSA,"the final season was about a show winding down and giving us a good conclusion to the series  And it did that very well. IT wasn't a action filled series mostly but it was heavily character driven and it did tie up all the loose ends of the series very well. The last episode is by far the slowest but it's still well acted drama and that's a good thing.  Of course if you compare this season to any of the others it is by far the weakest. But even saying that it's still a fine series , and this was the final season so they did what they needed to end it well.  The blu ray is far superior in picture to the dvd set and if you can see it that way then do so.  The dvd set is decent though and if that is what you have at least you have the final set.  There are extras on here as well in both sets.  Commentary and such.  I do think that they could have done a few more seasons, if they wanted , but this was a decent end to a modern classic show.  I do believe that this will be considered a classic tv show in the decades that follow this one.",1421539200,,1047,3.814814814814815
6499583,3,B00LPPIDSA,Very disappointed with this final season:( It feels like the writers got lazy and give up on the show:(. I watched the other prior seasons and I loved it but this final one was disappointing:(,1421539200,,192,4.514285714285714
6499584,4,B00LPPIDSA,"A lot of the reviews of this last season express disappointment, but I found the season to be better than anticipated - the dark humor of this series plays out much more in this last season.  I agree some characters seemed to just be lost or died unmourned deaths, and others (Tara & Alcide) just seemed to have contrived ""endings"" to their stories. My thoughts - the writers had 10 episodes to close down a lot of plot lines - I'll give them a B for this last season; the Season 7  slipped a bit, but the series did come to an end with the two main characters, and that ending ""fit"" for me.  I am sorry that I will have to move on to another series, but True Blood had some great moments - less in this final season, but then, I haven't seen reviewers like the ending of most shows (think the Sopranos).  You will get closure if you watch this season, and closure isn't always clean and what we want, but it does end things.  And Pam had one of the greatest lines ever - I will not spoil this, but wait until you hear what she says about the feeling a vampire gets when released by his/her maker.",1421366400,,1097,4.15566037735849

But it kind of was. I was pretty much just watching the show to find out what was going on with Eric, Pam, and Lafayette. Could not have possibly cared less about Bill and Sookie at this point. Charlaine Harris' ending (in my opinion) was infinitely better (even though it was not at all satisfying to me) than this.

The best part of this whole season were the scenes involving Ginger. I felt like after 7 seasons it was finally her time, and I guess the writers thought so too. The scene with her and Eric on the throne... I was biting my lips closed so I wouldn't wake up my child in the next room with laughing so hard.

So go ahead and vote my review as unhelpful simply because you disagree. Those are my thoughts on this rushed mess of a final season.",1420588800,38,936,4.223463687150838

6499678,3,B00LPPIDSA,"First up the final season is pretty short, there's not many episodes and what's here seems to be mostly going through the motions.  Season 6 actually ended the great series quite nicely, they should have left it there but I guess the opportunities to squeeze a few more bucks out of a loyal fan base was too tempting.  But obviously the main stars had commitments elsewhere, some such as Ryan Kwanten and Alexander Skarsgard now with a constant stream of movie work, so hence, the very few episodes.  Spoilers follow if you wish to read on.  The final season doesn't really make much sense with the final events of the prior one.  Why was Eric back?  It was fitting to die sunbaking in the alps with no way to get cover from the light since he was such an overconfident and somewhat arrogant character (he was my favourite by far though).  Perhaps that was the problem, he was most people's favourite so the final season needed him to get the go ahead and the writers had to lazily pretend he didn't meet his true death and bring him back.  Tara gets killed off in the first episode then we have a pointless boring rehash story revolving around her junkie mother so she can appear to her while high in each remainder episode with an important message, which was ridiculous as all it was, was to find some gun she buried in the front yard as a kid.  The kid actor that played her younger self looked like her, but the one supposed to be Sookie looked nothing like Anna Paquin.

Bringing back Hoyt also had no real point.  He and his girlfriend are looking at the family photo album and there aren't any pictures with Stackhouse in them, yet they were best friends? I was waiting on that to happen to make the season interesting, and see how Stackhouse would handle that. The scene that Hoyt ultimately walks in and saves the day was probably the best action/tension of the season but does it make sense that you would just walk into a room and shoot someone in the back when you don't really know anything about them or what they are?  I liked Hoyt's Alaskan girlfriend, it's a shame she wasn't introduced in earlier season as she gave Stackhouse a run for his money rather than the typical bimbo norm characters he interacts with.  It's only a couple of years into the future in the final episode and yet she somehow she has had about six kids with him, many who look older than the period of time that had passed, yet it's never divulged she is anything other than a regular human.  Who got Sookie pregnant?  What was the point of making her pregnant with no info on who the father is.  I mean she got around a bit so assuming she didn't change her ways possibly her character wouldn't know, but it would be nice for the viewers to.

Season 7 was an unnecessary season that was obviously made to fulfil advertising contracts, and amount of episode commitments to actors and probably those behind the scenes.",1419465600,,2908,4.466918714555765

6499685,3,B00LPPIDSA,"It went down since the first season. What I especially found anoying was the finalle, everything ends as a fairytale, and everyone suddenly fits into the molds of what a ""good"" society should look like (think everyone is married, has children, no sex, no hook ups or cheating, etc.).

What I liked about this series is how it dealt with transgresion, how individuals had to break the written or unwritten rules that promoted discrimination and racism. It was a deep exploration of our society, with all the good and the ugly, the strengths and the shortcomings of our modern age. It studied how we deal with the different, the stranger, and how we react with hostility when people who are different than us start showing up in our society. But this brave critique of America all ends in the final season, and the finalle just more of the same. Lets just make everyone happy, let's give them a picture-perfect family, where everyone is a perfect dad, or mom, or uncle.

In the end, the writers just sit back into comformism, and neutralize what made this series great.",1419292800,,1067,4.7005347593582885

My favorite scene was when he killed off members of the Yakuza, took their car, and drove off with their dead bodies in the back seat while bopping his head to techno music.

Although this season was not as good as the other seasons, I would still recommend it to True Blood fans. Everything wraps up in the end. You get to see what happens to the remaining characters.",1419033600,3,631,4.439655172413793

Alcide, in retrospect, had almost nothing to do the entire series than to be another dark, brooding beefcake in Sookie's narcissistic web (does this chick ever get over herself?!!)

I wish I could say more, but I don't want to put in any spoilers.  It was just very disappointing, to me.  I was also pissed at what happened to at least one character.  You know who I'm talking about, HBO.  That just sucked.  Huge fan of that character.  Ugh.  What, did the actor piss off a writer, or something?  Just a weird thing that happened.  If I'd watched it on TV, I probably would have stopped watching, but I bought the season all at once on Amazon.

There were some nice elements and funny elements.  Some nice character resolutions for the bit characters.  The entire season was really a wrap up, which is great, because when a show shuts down, you often don't get a ""goodbye"" season.  It would have been nice to have a little more action spliced in with the wrap-up.  It was wonderful to see good things happen in Bon Temps for once, at least toward the end--some characters finally got to meet ""the one"".

It was mostly enjoyable, despite occasionally wanting to yell at the screen.  I'd say it was 90% satisfying at the end.

""We called the final episode `Thank You' as a thank you to the fans who have stuck by us"" said showrunner Bill Buckner.

They might as well have called it ""F**K You"", because after 7 years I think the fans deserved something better than this. A new season of ""True Blood"" was a big annual event in our household - we ordered the boxed set, invited friends round, made southern chicken and a red velvet cake and mainlined the series over the weekend.

Season 7 was not worth the effort involved in watching it.

First, the lazy, lazy writing. Major plotlines were just abandoned mid series (attack of the hep-Vs). This was ten episodes of ""what shall we do with each of the characters?"". It became a guessing game of who was going to buy it/get hitched in each episode. We had characters back for the sake of it with absolutely nothing to contribute (much as I love Rutger Haeur his presence was completely pointless) A lot of the endings felt forced and as far as the main one went (trying not to spoil it for those unfortunate enough to still have the experience to come) - I've never seen such an unheroic, low key and useless disposal of a major character. The screamingly dull Tara/Mother stuff from Season One which was resolved in Season Six came back yet again to haunt us for no reason and a lot of time was spent on the fate of a couple of teenagers I couldn't have cared less about.

Second the special effects. There is a scene with Jason and Sam in a car that is so obviously stationary with a film of moving road playing in the background that its embarassing. Was there no money for post production? Or did they just not care?

Third the extras on this series consist of a brief feature talking to main cast players - that's it. No other extras other than audio commentary which would involve watching it again - not something I'm prepared to do. I'd have thought the least they could do would have been to make the extras special given that it was the last series. It gives the impression that they rushed this out so they could grab your money in time for Christmas.

As a fan, I guess you have to see it for completeness. However it is not recommended in any way whatsoever",1416960000,50,2220,4.4156479217603914
6499777,3,B00LPPIDSA,"If you haven't read the novels, I recommend this series highly.

6499780,2,B00LPPIDSA,"Like other reviewers, I have watched every other season of TB, several times, and with a few notable exceptions, the show has been highly entertaining and very well executed.

I will keep this brief. There are some ***SPOILERS***, and I hope the 'fast forward' button on my DVD remote has not been worn out from overuse during this finale season.

Frankly, I think the show could have just about ended at Season 6. Eric went up in a ball of flame on a snowy mountain, like some ancient god copping it big time. Every other character sort of knew where they were - in a bit of a mess, not coping terribly well, but with hope.

My thought is that Season 7 shows, if nothing else, just how much money HBO has to throw around at the moment.

I positively hated the clunky, corny flashbacks. I hated the complete change in tempo and story line. I almost dry-retched at the silly ending where everything is resolved like some Little Golden Book.

The entire season was ultra-camp bordering on the hysterical, and I do not mean 'funny'.

Previous seasons had complex plots, and I am not arguing that any character or sub plot was invalid because of the inclusion of a theme about particular sexual orientation. I am a very open-minded person. I thoroughly enjoyed previous seasons and Lafayette was one of my favorite characters who has some of the best lines in the entire series.

However, it just felt to me that the entire Season 7 of TB had been the result of some clumsy afternoon tea brainstorming sessions by a gaggle of over-emotional drag queens - I don't wish to offend anyone but that is the best way I can describe it.

I resented the way we were left hanging after season 6 as to whether Eric had bitten the dust - as just one example - but it was obvious he was going to come back in the final season, yet with no explanation as to how he survived his little mountaintop BBQ.

I could have done without the resolution of Jason's love life, including the return of Hoyt - who, in my opinion, should have been drained and left to rot much earlier. The reconciliation with Jessica was, frankly, preposterous.

The direction was clunky, the dialogue was draining, the anticipation was zero - I felt a strong urge to get glamoured myself so I could forget I'd ever wasted so many hours of my life.

I don't quite understand the process in Hollywood that could deliver such an unmitigated travesty compared to the previous seasons.

Serious viewers who appreciated the brave, risque, mind-bending and (let's be honest) brutality on show in previous seasons may walk away from this season wondering why, in terms of what was delivered, the classification (in Australia) should have been reduced from R (Restricted to 18 and over)  probably to PG (Parental Guidance Required) or even G (General Viewing) - which is usually reserved for cartoons or Andre Rieu concerts.

I also get royally pissed off when leading actors are given the chance to direct an episode of any show - this is serious business, folks, and is not to be trifled with - let them hone their directing skills on someone else's treasured series! There, I've had my little rant.

Sorry, but I am yet to calm down about Season 7, although I am no longer hysterical. I'll have a Bloody Mary, thank you, and keep them coming.",1416873600,14,3289,4.588737201365188

6499785,4,B00LPPIDSA,"Since in this household, we don't subscribe to the super-channels, we must always wait until the current season's DVD sets are released in order to catch up on fave cable TV series like True Blood.  The downside of this is that most of the spoilers have already made their insidious ways into our lives, long before we actually clap eyes on the episodes.

The books were a great read, long before I had ever heard of the possibility of a TV series......and I must admit that I am one of those fans who has been a bit put off by the divergence in the storylines.....however, since I now consider the book set and the TV series to be two completely different entities in parallel dimensions, I was ready for whatever ending the TV series had to offer, or so I thought.

Between the spoilers and my dimensional shifting, I find that I have joined the ranks of those fans of the series who found this last season to be less than we had imagined it would be.  I cannot really figure this out as I am actually quite a sap for happy endings......and yet, this one seemed forced to me.  So many storylines and characters were so quickly snuffed out after six seasons of complex interactions with each other, that I found myself becoming less engaged with the overall storyline as these last episodes unfolded.  [AAGH!  My beloved hunky werewolf!]

Overall, this series is indeed a ""keeper"", and is already being re-watched from the beginning, but in my opinion, (not that this matters anymore at all), this gloriously over-the-top series just kind of withered away.  Watching the episodes with the audio commentary did help, but I am still left rather underwhelmed by the end of it all.

When Alan Ball left after Season 5, I remained optimistic that the show would still be entertaining and full of my favorite characters. Season 6 was enjoyable, and then came this. What a *huge* let down. I have every single season on DVD, but I will never buy this one. I never want to watch it again. It was boring, they killed characters off for no reason that made sense to the plot. What made it worse was the writers spent all this time on new characters and unimportant side characters. I didn't care about Adilyn and Wade's story or Tara's mom. They retconned several things (for one, Tara's mom had an affair with Rev Daniels, that is how they began, but they rewrote their relationship as being some pure, romantic, sweet thing).

I have always been an Eric fan, but I also liked Bill. By the end, I wanted to scream, just die already! They made this last season so full of insufferable angst, it was painful to watch. They squandered Lafayette. They squandered Willa, who had the potential to be an interesting character as Eric's new progeny from last season.

I like Hoyt and all, but he and Jessica did not make sense anymore. Jessica did *not* want to be with him anymore when he originally left and suddenly, it's all romance and marriage?! Talk about throwing something together. And then Bridget and Jason being thrown together. No, that is bad writing.

There was *so* much bad writing this last season. All the stuff in the beginning with the Bon Temps vigilante group and the hep-v vampires... it seemed like such a waste of precious screen time.

They did a *horrible* job of bringing Sookie and Bill to a resolution. It wasn't romantic.

I'm glad Eric and Pam got a happy-ever-after. They are my favorites. I've always liked Andy and Holly and was glad to see the development of Andy's character over the seasons. He is one of the best reasons to watch. Jason is another favorite, but unfortunately, he seemed to regress back to the early days, but I guess that was the easy way to get him with Bridget. *such lazy writing*

They wasted use of a great actor this season with Sam Trammell, but I was at least happy his character Sam escaped Bon Temps because that place ended up looking so unappealing. I can't imagine why anyone would ever want to stay there. There are so many other things I could say about how lacking this season was. One of the worst series-enders ever (through no fault of the actors by any means).

There were some highlights (seeing some old favorites show up for one last time, seeing more of Ginger, flashbacks, a sexy Jason/Eric scene, to name a few).

I can not believe they killed Tara off-screen. They revitalized her character by making her a vampire only to kill her off-screen and then let her horrible mother live and take up all this screen time with a story that didn't even mean anything or go anywhere  - Tara with snakes on a cross -what?! (Adina Porter is a fine actress, so I don't hold her accountable, it's the writers who failed here. They had the perfect opportunity to have vampire Tara heal her relationship with her mother, but instead they went for a cheap shock and killed Tara off in the first scene of the season and had her mom become a V-addict to hallucinate her way to a resolution and forgiveness from a ghost Tara.) #eyeroll

Alcide dies from a random bullet? Are you kidding me? They never did his character right on that show, esp. starting last season when he started eating human college students? That was bizarre. Alcide would never do that.

I do highly recommend this show, but only through season 6. They ended this show about as bad as the books.  What a HUGE let-down both have been.",1416441600,103,3684,4.555219364599092

Bad ending, confusing season and never closed up questions or showed you anything to tie up loose ends.

6499873,3,B00LPPIDSA,"I read the books and was angry, like so many others, that Harris would allow Sookie to marry Sam and live in his trailer and go on being a waitress for the rest of her life.  Sure, Sookie and Sam could have kids.  I watched Seasons 1-3 after a long break from the books because I knew that the character of Tara took a different turn in the series and I had to put my pre-conceived ideas about the characters aside before I returned to the HBO series.  I had Prime access to the first three seasons and I enjoyed the ability to go through that many seasons and watch the characters come, go, and develop in  ways that Harris did not develop them in the books.

Well, so I skipped to the last show in Season 7, and while I am glad that the show went out on its own terms, allowing the ability to close the loop, I am still saddened by the fact that Sookie did not end up with a super-hot supernatural--minus the accompanying drama.  I'm am underwhelmed by the death of BIll  the marriage of Sookie to some nameless, faceless human man--although I'm sure he's a great guy.

I really wish that with all the pharmaceutical advances in the show, that there'd  been an option for pregnancy that would result in an un-Twilight weird kid.  Heck, when I finished reading the books, like many others, I was hoping that Sookie would have hooked up with Eric.  I'm glad Sookie got her normal life, but I wish that it had included some one we'd invested in.  I suppose having Jessica and Hoyt as next door neighbors will suffice--we are left with no alternate futures for Sookie.  Sookie is a strong, independent, and thoughtful woman, and I think the HBO and the book series did her character a solid dis-service.  Boo.

I will say this, I am happy that Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer made a real-life marriage.  In the end, Sookie got her man.  I'm glad they have adorable twins as well.  I thought while watching the last episode how difficult it must have been from them to complete those scenes.  Imagining life without your best friend in fiction or real-life is exceedingly difficult.

I have to wonder if there isn't some sort of  underlying spoof or inside joke going on, like ""lets do our characters gay this week"" then ""lets take turns directing this week"" then ""lets all act pious and pretentious like Bill this week"".

6499882,2,B00LPPIDSA,"The first half of the season started out strongly, continuing over the consequences of the season before. There were some surprising early decisions- and (spoilers) Tara's ""exit"" was shocking but ultimately disappointing. The infected vampires, and allusions to the breakdown of a society fearful of them, was really intriguing. However, this suddenly resolved half way through, which was a mistake I think.

The rest of the season was appalling. It has to be seen to its last episode to fully get how totally the writers dropped the ball. It's like they let the office intern write the rest. By the second to last episode, we knew that there was going to be no exciting finale, nothing to pull it all together. You could see how they were aiming to end the season with everyone being happily in relationships, to the point that some characters were introduced purely for that purpose. Significant time was wasted on Tara's mother- a character I liked before- and some ridiculous ghost Tara story that didn't add anything to what we already knew.

The last episode was one of those truly disappointing experiences, that you just had to get through because if you didn't, you'd always wonder.

My advice: watch up until the mid season, where the early story arc is obviously concluded, and maybe watch the episode with the wake. But then stop.",1412899200,5,1342,4.87719298245614

This season has the action and sex but was so much more involved in the emotional side with characters facing some of the realities (as muach as possible in a vampire show) and moving on by accpeitng who and what people are.

Even though fast the NU Blood was story line was a little loosely handled but it still wrapped up things and did not leave you hanging.  Overall a decent way to end things and provide some degree of closure to it all. .

Overall True Blood was a very entertaining and at times, through provoking serries it you apply the differences and challenges as metaphores to other aspects of life. .I am pleased I invested the time to watch the serries and now it is my time to say my good bye and THANK YOU.

Imagine you had a favorite pair of jeans.  You loved them so much but they became tattered (and not in a good way).  You tried to sew them but the best you could do is put patches on them, ugly patches.  These were still your jeans but not the same. This is how I see how the writers botched up our beloved series.  They kept putting ugly patches on True Blood. It was still recognized as True Blood but a horrible version.
After barely keeping up with Season 6, I watched Season 7 as a chore I felt I had to do.  Surprisingly, I liked the first few episodes and then it all fell apart.  Why did we have to go back to Taraville? Who cares about the Reverend or Tara's mother?  Wasn't their story all sewn up?  Why was so much time spent on Jessica and Hoyt?  Jason?  Snore.  Sara Newlin?  Double snore.  I  give this review three stars because I still enjoyed the wonderful humorous dialogue of Pam. Don't expect not to be disappointed.  If it was still a great series, I would be very sad that it ended but considering the way it went, it deserved the true death!",1411430400,51,1082,4.209756097560976

6499930,1,B00LPPIDSA,"As an avid Truebie, the final season of my favorite series was a bitter disappointment. I own all previous seasons on DVD, but after seeing the finale, I have canceled my subscription to HBO. It was that bad. I don't want to include spoilers that might ruin the season for those who have not viewed it -- though I don't know how you could possibly ruin something so badly done. I can say that the writers must have decided that this was the last lap and they were just sick of it and didn't bother concluding it in a satisfactory fashion. Buckner absolutely lied to the fans when he said that there would be something satisfying for every fan in the finale -- something we each could feel good about and come away happy. This not only didn't happen, but it left me feeling that I had wasted seven years and that HBO owes me a refund for six years of foreplay followed by falling asleep.",1409356800,17,886,4.343373493975903
6499931,4,B00LPPIDSA,"First of all, this is not like any season of True Blood you've ever watched before. I've been watching since way back when season one aired and have watched every season at least two or three times. Like many of you, I've always found myself enthralled by the tight plots, dynamic characters, and sharp dialogue. Season 7 was incredibly different than ones from the past... But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

I think the reason that season 7 is so different is because it is heavily character driven, whereas the previous seasons have been more plot driven. True Blood season 7 (TB7) really digs deep into our favorite characters' inner psyches and fleshes out how they have grown and changed throughout the years. Due to this more character-oriented storyline, a lot of the action seen in past seasons is lost, replaced with more dialogue, character development, and personal reflection. I know this upset some fans (I myself was a bit perturbed by it at times), but, looking back at the series as a whole, this direction was truly needed to end the show without cheapening the characters.

In a nutshell, the theme of TB7 is mortality; not even the vampires have a sense of immortality anymore, due to the devastating Hepatitis V virus. The characters really have to come to terms with the fact that every moment could be their last. This approach sort of takes away from the allure and appeal of vampires as they are in pop culture, but it injects the mood of the show with a sense of urgency and humanity that is very touching and humbling to the characters.

Unfortunately, for a lot of TV series, much of the judgement placed on the series as a whole is based on that show's finale instead of the sum of its parts. I believe that this is a cycle that automatically sets finales up for failure. Looking at the series as a whole, I believe that TB7 gave us a satisfying ending. Notice, I said ""satisfying,"" not ""spectacular"" or ""terrible."" It's impossible to end a show like True Blood and please everybody. It just can't be done. I do think the writers did the best job they could have done and created an ending that was palatable. Would it have been fun to see a little more risk or for the writers to pull a complete 180 on us? Yes, maybe, but based on the direction True Blood has been going, it would have felt inauthentic. When I looked at the ending for what it was, instead of what I wanted, I found myself to be very happy with it.

This was a very hard season to review; I've had so much history with this show and have been so emotionally invested into it that I felt I was going to be very biased with my writing. After reading over this review a few times, I believe I can say that it is a pretty accurate depiction of TB7. If you're a longtime fan as well, I encourage you to watch TB7 and make your own judgements. If you're new to the True Blood franchise, I implore you to begin the series immediately; I don't believe any other show has brought me more joy or thrills... And for that, I say ""Thank You,"" True Blood.",1408924800,155,3044,4.440071556350627
