2891270,5,B000SVMEA0,"Once again, Jack Wagner provides a multi-layered acting approach in this made for television movie.  He stars as an airline pilot heart throb who propels his way through the sky catering to women at multiple destinations.  It is only a matter of time before the truth comes out and when it does, well, you will just have to see it.  Another must see.",1365897600,,350,4.523809523809524

2891272,5,B000SVMEA0,This is a great movie. I bought this movie at Walmart for one buck years ago. What a steal. It's about a airline pilot who cheats on his wife and continue to do so until he is caught. This is a very good movie. If you see it don't pass by it buy it.,1307577600,,249,3.6296296296296298

Much to his dismay, the separate worlds he lives in begin to collide, and the truth of his womanizing and bigamy begin to come to light. Reality: Based on the case of John Charles Lutter.

2891274,5,B000SVMEA0,"I got this disc because I saw the movie once and wanted it to be my own. I like Shelley Hack and Jack Wagner...the storyline is good and fun. The quality of this disc is excellent and I got it right away after I ordered it!

Very happy and pleased with this purchase!!!",1269388800,,269,4.0754716981132075
2891275,4,B000SVMEA0,"Frequent Flier is an excellent showcase for actress Shelly Hack as the wife who is cheated upon.  Well done drama playing human emotions agsinst a backdrop of marital strife.  Good movie watching, but tough to take if you are a Shelly Hack fan, it's sad to see her world destroyed by an unfaithful husband.  Shelly Hack, as usual, shines in this movie.",1246060800,,352,4.645161290322581
2891276,1,B000SVMEA0,"About 30 minutes into the movie the sound disappeared and reappeared a few minutes later.  Later on in the movie, the sound quality was poor and again sound was lost later.  It was a new DVD, not a used one.  Contact with the seller was quite productive...I was given full credit on my charge card, however, I would rather have had a replacement DVD.",1245888000,,350,4.4375
2891277,5,B000SVMEA0,"This movie is a true American classic, in the sense that you can make a drinking game out of almost every event in this film. For instance, every time horses appear in this film, which are more often then you think. Often enough to have you hammered 20 minutes in. There are some really confusing parts to this movie, like Addy (the young boy in the film) makes hand gestures when describing a package his mother got for his father. There is unfortunately zero nudity, making this one a good one for the whole family. The story line encourages strong family values in the end as well, so that is a plus. Oh, and airline stock footage called, they want their shots back.",1201219200,6,669,4.4471544715447155
2891278,5,B000SVMEA0,I saw this movie on lifetime years ago.  It is one of my all time favorites.  It will also enlighten you to how a cheaters mind work.  But in this case he Honestly fell in love with all the women.  Good storyline.,1197158400,2,213,4.0

8207013,5,B000SVMEA0,Incredible  how this pilot had three wives/lives until it all came crashing down.  He didn't even see or feel that it was wrong or hurtful to any of the woman.  One mistake by leaving a receipt in his car ended up leading to his downfall and the sad destruction of three woman's lives and his son. Jack Wagner is an awesome actor and the actors who played his wives were great as well.  Well done.,1498953600,,397,4.253333333333333
8207014,5,B000SVMEA0,"Saw this as a tv movie before.
Fun to watch it again.
Good romantic drama
Glad to have found this for my collection.",1495497600,,116,4.086956521739131
8207015,5,B000SVMEA0,"GREAT movie! The more you watch it the more you will love it. Wish I could have purchased a ""NEW"" copy without having to sell a body part to afford it.",1445990400,,151,3.903225806451613

8207018,5,B000SVMEA0,"While he goes merrily along betraying every woman in his life while searching out others to betray, he is unaware that his joy ride is about to come to a screeching halt.  In some instances the acting could have been better.  You can always spot the HIRED IN DALLAS talent from the professional actors but it doesn't matter because you are so caught up in the story right from the start.  And, what fun when ""the worm turns"" so to speak and the fur starts to fly.  You will love seeing Shelley Hack as the original and only real wife when she finally ""gets a clue"" and follows it no matter how much it hurts to know the truth.  I'm buying a copy to lend a friend as I'm afraid she might lose my copy. I live in the area where this story happened and where it was filmed so was fun to spot familiar places. Proves the saying Never Trust a Man Whose Eyes are Too Small and Set Too Close Together.",1395446400,,894,4.144508670520231
8207019,5,B000SVMEA0,Based on the true story of a misunderstood genius. Jack Wagner at his best; get your hands on this under-rated classic before it's too late.,1380672000,,140,4.64
8207020,5,B000SVMEA0,"The first time I saw this movie was back in the 90s before I got into aviation. Now after 10 years flying for an airline, I can testify that the story in the movie and many others are true. In this profession you hear and see things that will make you head spin. I guess it's the effect of pressurization that affect people in a weird way.
The movie although low budget was very nice and easy to watch and understand. It is 1990s technology so don't expect much but the sound and picture are pretty good for that era. I think people in aviation will appreciate this movie more than somebody outside of the industry but it is still a good watch.",1372896000,2,644,4.2439024390243905
8207021,4,B000SVMEA0,"I enjoyed all the actors, although the story was sad. I always like Jack Wagner. The plot was entertaining even though it is hard to imagine that it actually is a true story.",1371600000,,174,4.303030303030303
