1234552,3,B00000JMOP,"Famed director Fritz Lang directed and wrote this two part serial.  It was supposed to be 4 chapters but the last 2 were never made.  Kay Hoog (Carl de Vogt) is one of those bachelor-world-adventurers based in San Francisco.  Part 1 is called ""The Golden Sea.""  When a message in a bottle is picked up off the coast of South America, he learns that it was written by a missing Harvard professor who had discover a lost treasure of gold in Peru.  An acquaintance of Hoog's known as Lio Sha (Ressel Orla), picks up on the information, steals the message and heads there herself.

It turns out she is the head of a criminal organization known as The Spiders.  Their calling card is a toy hairy spider.  In a chopped together sequence, Hoog and Lio get to the Inca stomping ground just in time for a human sacrifice to the sun god.  Lio is captured, destined to be slain.  In the meantime Hoog has saved the local sun princess Naela (Lil Dagover) from an anaconda and they immediately fall in love.

One thing leads to another but Hoog saves the life of Lio and escapes with Naela using a quickly created boat made out of leaves and sticks.  Lio and what remain of her henchmen fight over the discovered gold and start killing each other.  Lio makes it out alive and gets back to San Francisco along with Hoog and the princess.  Lio expresses her love for Hoog but he wants no part of her.  He loves Naela and marries her.  Lio, now pissed, takes out her vengeance on Naela (leaving the spider behind) and Part 1 ends.

Part 2 is known as ""The Diamond Ship.""  This continuation finds Hoog seeking his own revenge, begins to look for Lio and a large diamond that was found back in Peru.  This episode runs about 30 minutes longer than the first and is not nearly as much fun.  There is all kinds of convoluted plot pieces including an underground city in San Francisco, travels to India, more bad guys and more subterfuge.  It's all quite hard to follow especially with the poor film stock and hapless editing in this version.  Certainly part one has its moments but part 2 is a long, disorienting mess.  This is Lang's third film and the oldest that is available.  For that reason, it warrants a look.",1379030400,,2197,4.435
1234553,4,B00000JMOP,"I'm a Fritz Lang fan and was happy when this silent series released by Kino.  It's great having Chapter 1 and 2 together in one set.  It's too bad Chapter 3 was never made.  This series may be the original influence for Indiana Jones.  Action and world adventure awaits while watching out for the international gang, ""The Spiders"". Maybe someone will remake the series with all 3 parts.",1341100800,2,386,4.632352941176471
1234554,4,B00000JMOP,"Many decades before Steven Spielberg and George Lucas would create the ""Indiana Jones"" films, back in the 1919, Austrian filmmaker Fritz Lang would write and direct his adventure epic ""The Spiders (Die Spinnen)"".

It all began not long after Lang was discharged from the Austrian Army, having been wounded in combat, Lang would use his time during his recovery to write ideas he had for films.  As an actor for the Viennese theater circuit, he was hired at Decla, which was a Berlin-based production studio led by producer Erich Pommer.

During the early stages of his career, Fritz Lang would create art films but his popular thriller ""The Spiders"" was known for combining German Expressionist techniques and popular mainstream cinema and in essence, it was considered as art house cinema.

And for many decades, this film had been considered lost until it was discovered in the 1970's.  While a restoration was done in 1978 and released on DVD in 1999.  A new restoration was commissioned from a tinted 35mm print and footage that was not included in the 1999 DVD release has been added to the 2012 DVD release courtesy of Kino Lorber Inc.

""The Spiders"" is considered to be the beginning of the golden age of silent cinema.  Originally, there was a planned trilogy but only two films were created.

The first episode ""The Golden Sea"" begins with a man escaping from the Inca's who are planning to use him as a sacrifice. The man, a Harvard professor who has been missing since his travel to Peru,  writes a note, which he puts into a bottle and throws it off to the ocean before being speared.

We are then introduced to Kay Hoog (played by Carl de Vogt), a sportsman who is attending a high society party for those involved in a major yacht race from San Francisco to Japan.  But Kay is not planning to take part in the competition as he found a bottle in sea from the missing Harvard professor that said there is treasure located inside a temple of a lost Incan civilization.  Coordinates were included and now Kay hopes to travel to that area and find some treasure.

But also attending the party is Lio Sha, the head of a secret criminal organization known as the Spiders now wants that information that Hoog possesses.  And immediately, they break into Hoog's home and steals the treasure map.

It's a race against time as Hoog begins his expedition to find the treasure at the lost Incan civilization and hopefully get it before the Spider's can.  But in return for them stealing his map, Hoog ends up stealing an even more important map from the Spiders on the location of The Diamond Ship.

As Kay is wanted by the Spiders and everyone trying to find the lost treasure, Kay encounters the beautiful Priestess of the Sun named Naela.  But with the Incan's aware that there are outsiders in their area, who will live and who will die?

In episode two, ""The Diamond Ship"", after facing a major tragedy caused by the hands of the Spiders, they have now made things personal for Kay.

With the Spiders now seeking a diamond on the ""Diamond Ship"", the Spiders hope with the possession of the Buddha head diamond will release Asia from tyranny.  And Lio Sha believes that the diamond may be in the possession of a millionaire named Terry Landon (played by Rudolph Lettinger).  But when the Spiders do not find it, they kidnap his daughter Ellen (played by Thea Zander) and will not release her until they get the diamond.

But since Kay has the information about the Diamond Ship which he stole from the Spiders, perhaps he can find it and help bring Ellen back home.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Spiders"" is presented in 1:33:1 and is color-tinted from sepia to red.  It's important to note that the color-tinting is not the same as the 1999 Image Entertainment DVD release.  With the new restoration that was done by the Blazena Urgosikova and Ingrid Tetkova, the main goal was to introduce some of the missing footage but also to fix the speed of the film.

With the original 1999 DVD release, there were silent film fans who were critical that ""The Spiders"" was a bit too fast.  I personally have not seen the 1999 DVD release but have read that the new restoration does fix that problem.  Personally, movements seemed natural to me and not overly sped up or too slow.

As for picture quality, as one can expect from a film that is 90-years-old, you are going to see some scratches but in the context of silent films, ""The Spiders"" looks very good and doesn't have any major nitrate damage, warping, blurring or blackening on the film print.

While it's not my preference to see a lot of red color tinting in the film (as I'm so used to seeing sepia, orange, blue and green), I am not too sure of the differences of the color tinting from the previous Dave Shepard restoration.

For the most part, the film was in much better shape than expected and looks good on DVD.

As for audio, the music is composed and performed by Ben Model.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Spiders"" does not come with any special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The release of ""The Spiders"" on DVD is fantastic!  With the original 1999 DVD release out-of-print and costing a lot due to its rarity, with a lot of interested in Fritz Lang films (may it be his silents such as ""Metropolis"" or his foray into Hollywood Film Noir), Kino Lorber has been very good when it comes to the release of Fritz Lang films on Blu-ray and DVD.

While the Spiders has been released on DVD back in 1999, the 2012 DVD release is said to be better because it includes lost footage and also a corrected speed. The original Image Entertainment DVD ran for 137 minutes, this new version is 170 minutes long (which is possibly the newer footage and the slowing down of speed).  According to the credits, this version was licensed by Transit Film on behalf of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung and archival sources were from the Cinematheque Royale de Belgique and Filmovych laboratorich Barrandov Praha.

While I never watched the original 1999 DVD release, going by story alone, ""The Spiders"" was an intriguing and surprising adventure epic.

Sure, ""The Spiders"" was shot many decades before the Indiana Jones films and sure, the technology involved in production has evolved a lot since 1919 and 1920 but considering what was accomplished on this film, there was a decent amount of production in recreating the Incan civilization with its appearance of Incan carved rocks in the first film and a lot of focus on makeup and costume design for both films.

The first film ""Episode One: The Golden Sea"" was enjoyable as you get the suave adventurer/sportsman Kay Hoog.  With the tuxedo and the slicked back hair and look that seemed more like a prototype to a James Bond film, ""The Spiders"" had style but it also had an intriguing story with Kay trying to get to the treasure before his adversaries, the criminal organization the Spiders and their leader Lio Sha gets to it.

And for 1919, the overall storyline was adventurous and intriguing but it's that extra touch at the end which you don't expect, that made the first film so much more enjoyable and exciting and making you want to see the sequel.

But one you do watch the sequel, ""Episode Two: The Diamond Ship"", I felt that the second film was rushed as Fritz Lang tried to incorporate too much and focus more on the adventures and action than the storyline itself.

While it was intriguing to see Kay Hoog going underground in China Town to find Lio Sha and the Spiders, everything afterward seemed as if it was not well-planned.  As much as I enjoyed the fact that Lang wanted to take the viewer from one location to another, unfortunately, it's not executed all that well.  There were far too many characters and unlike the first film which tried to narrow things down between Kay Hoog and Lio Sha, the storyline was all over the place.

But bare in mind, this was Fritz Lang's earlier work, done way before ""Metropolis"", ""Spies"", ""M"" and his ""Dr. Mabuse"" films, but there is no doubt that with Lang working on these two films, he would improve significantly a few years later to take on films such as ""Destiny"" (1921), ""Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler"" (1922) and ""Siegfried"" (1924).

For any Fritz Lang cinema enthusiasts, ""The Spiders"" is essential viewing if you want to see Lang's earlier work but how he tries to integrate German expressionism and arthouse with a action/adventure theme.  Whether or not it's good, it is all subjective but I enjoyed ""The Spiders"", the first episode a lot more than the second.  But for any cineaste, one can see how much Fritz Lang evolved in filmmaking during the 1920's and eventually for hardcore fans, how much his work has changed when he left to work in America.

Overall, ""The Spiders"" is a DVD release worth watching.  You often don't come upon a silent film release in which its main protagonist has that James Bond suave look, characters traveling to exotic locations and action sequences in different parts of the world.  If you are a cineaste who is passionate about Fritz Lang's oeuvre especially his very early works, this DVD is a fine addition to add in your cinema collection!",1335571200,11,9130,4.670625
1234555,4,B00000JMOP,"I first became familiar with THE SPIDERS in David Shepard's 1999 version on Image DVD. It will always have a special place in my silent film collection as it was my introduction to the exotic pulp fiction serials of the silent era that would culminate years later in the INDIANA JONES films of Steven Spielberg. After seeing the 2 silent features that make up THE SPIDERS (THE GOLDEN SEA and THE DIAMOND SHIP), I was primed for THE INDIAN TOMB (which Fritz Lang co-wrote but missed out on directing until he made his own version 40 years later) and the earlier serials of Louis Feuillade (THE VAMPIRES, JUDEX, FANTOMAS) which inspired this film. In the company of the Feuillade serials and the later silent films of Lang, THE SPIDERS gets unfairly dismissed which is unfortunate as it has much to offer especially in this new transfer.

The biggest knock against the old version was that the print was not in great shape. Shepard explained that we were lucky to have the film at all and that it took a lot of work to put it back together from materials found in Czech archives. The new version appears to use the same Czech materials but has the advantage of new restoration techniques developed in the last 10 years. Nevertheless those expecting a complete restoration are bound to be disappointed as compared to NOSFERATU, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA or the 2003 version of METROPOLIS, this still looks pretty rough. It is longer (173 minutes -vs- 137 minutes) and, as much as I love Gaylord Carter organ scores, the new Ben Model score will be more audience friendly as will the print improvement and new title cards.

For those unfamiliar with the scenario, it involves intrepid adventurer Kay Hoog (pronounced HOAG - Carl de Vogt) and his confrontations with the international criminal organization The Spiders headed up by the remarkably intense femme fatale Lio Sha (Ressel Orla). Separately they seek to recover Incan treasure and later a priceless diamond known as the ""Buddha's Head"". Murders, betrayals, escapes, exotic locales are all there in the mix along with Lang's eye for striking visual composition which is what separates THE SPIDERS from the serials of Feuillade. The sets are fabulous, the costumes elaborate, and the performances (most notably Ressel Orla's) are deliriously intense. This more complete version is a welcome addition to the Fritz Lang filmography just don't expect M or METROPOLIS or for it to look like it was shot yesterday.",1330560000,24,2458,4.892086330935252
1234556,5,B00000JMOP,"I finally got hold of this, and even if it is the oldest of Lang's films to survive (he made two before this), it was the last of his German made films that I saw. The films (there are indeed two films, The Golden Lake and The Diamond Ship)are high adventure, in the best tradition of Jules Verne and Arthur Conan Doyle. As our gentleman adventurer shoots, rides, swims, wades and balloons himself towards his goal, Lang utilizes every trick in the book (he didn't get the memo that says ""Silents must be boring"") to hold his viewers. For anybody that enjoys the politically incorrect adventure tales of the Victorian and Edwardian ages, as well as the Orientalist and art nouveau-ish design of the pre-WW2 upper classes. This film is a must.

I have seldom seen a film of this age holding up so well. I absolutely agree with the reviewer that wanted this film re-restored. A gem of the Weimar cinema.",1238544000,11,901,4.561728395061729
1234557,4,B00000JMOP,"The earliest known surviving film directed by Fritz Lang, this two-part serial, originally intended as a four-parter, isn't exactly a shining example of either Lang or silent cinema as its finest, but it is interesting enough story-wise, as well as having some pretty impressive sets and good acting.  Film was really in a transitional state in the late Teens and early Twenties, moving from the more simplistic plots and overly dramatic acting styles popular in the early years of silent features to the more mature and complex types of films that emerged in the next phase of silent cinema.  This film in particular really does seem like a precursor of sorts to Indiana Jones.  It opens with an old man sending out a message in a bottle just before he is murdered, and we come to find out that he was a Harvard professor who was taken prisoner by Incas who still practice human sacrifice.  When this news reaches the story's hero, millionaire adventurer Kay Hoog, he calls off his involvement in an upcoming yacht race in favor of going off in search of the vast treasure the professor said these Incas have.  At the same time that his party sets out, the criminal organisation the Spiders also sends out a party (after having attacked Kay when they discovered his plans), since they want the treasure for themselves.  The adventure continues in South America and back into Europe, and then into other exotic locales such as India and the Falkland Islands.  Along the way there are a lot of action sequences, mind control, kidnappings, the search for a lost diamond, a love triangle, and intrigue.

However, because this was made when film was at a transitional period, and Lang was just learning his craft, it doesn't exactly come across as a great story.  The pacing can be really uneven (such as how a number of intertitles are along the lines of ""Two days later"" and ""Five weeks later,"" as well as how some rather important events, such as Kay being overpowered by the Spiders and thrown into a cell, never happen onscreen but instead are relayed via intertitle), coupled with a lot of ridiculous and implausible plot twists, such as the passenger pigeon conveniently just outside of Four-Finger John's window who then just as conveniently flies to the ship where the rest of the Spiders are, the love at first sight between Kay and the Incan priestess, the diamond's alleged power to free Asia from foreign tyranny, and the poisonous gas that comes up just in time to enable Kay's escape from the Spiders when they're holding him hostage at one point.  Part Two seems to be better than Part One, though it ends rather abruptly (albeit after tying up some of the more important plot points), almost in media res.  If the third and fourth installments had been made, it probably could have been a much more satisfying and entertaining viewing experience.  The print isn't exactly wonderful, but I've seen a lot worse, and we should be grateful that any print of such a rare film, long presumed lost, still exists at all instead of pedantically complaining that it wasn't crystal-clear and didn't have the utmost restoration done.",1192406400,5,3134,4.794063079777366
1234558,4,B00000JMOP,"Apparently there's no decent surviving prints of The Spiders so it would be difficult to determine just how successful the restoration was back in the 70s.  I would dare say though, that a more modern digital restoration could be done today and think personally that this is a significant enough film to deserve the full digital restoration treatment.  Be that as it may, the restoration is very watchable and the fact that the film had been found at all and fixed up by David and Kim Shepard is impressive.

I'm a fan of the early adventure pulps and of cliffhanger serials. So it was great to actually see Fritz Lang's early contribution towards these ends.  The story has been gone over by several reviews and easily found online.  I just want to urge viewers to not be put off on the fact that it is silent (with an original organ score that sometimes verges on cheesy Casio sounds, but tends to hold on to its dignity) because the great visuals Lang is famous for, and fun action adventure should be able to keep most audiences captivated.

If you are a fan of Gunga Din, Indiana Jones and the more exotic pulp adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs or Talbot Mundy, I can't imagine you will not find this to be a great treasure chest of iconic pulp and cliffhanger-type imagery.

The reason I don't give this five stars is solely based on the Image Entertainment release, because I think the price of this single DVD with no extras is exorbitant to say the least.  Outside of the fact that this was a rare film to find and restore (which has nothing to do with Image themselves), the Criterion-esque price tag does not reflect any value-added properties as you would find on a Criterion release, and in fact is closer to something you'd find from Alpha Video, meaning extremely bare bones.  At the very least, a commentary track by the Shepards or a film historian would have been interesting and added some extra value to justify $30 for a single disc.

It might be wishful thinking to get a better release anytime in the near future, so either do like me and take the hit to the wallet for the Image release from amazon or patiently search a less expensive means of finding it, like amazon's merchant-shops or other online auction sites, etc. Or if you don't mind VHS, that is easily found for under $5.",1173139200,7,2307,4.550724637681159
1234559,4,B00000JMOP,"Kay Hoog finds a message in a bottle floating near San Francisco.  The message tells about a hidden Incan city filled with gold and gives the location for finding it.  Intrigued, Kay tells his yacht club that he's going to find it.  Later,  Lia Sha, also a member of the club and the mysterious Spiders, steals the map and sets off for Peru, with Kay not far behind.
Thus, begins the Indiana Jones-like adventure which leads from Peru to a hidden city beneath San Francisco to a deadly cave in the Falkland Islands.  ""Spiders"" from German director Fritz Lang, contains the first two parts of what was to be a 4-part serial.  It's not the greatest of all adventure stories and has quite a few plot holes, but it's easy to see the influence it has on many of the adventure films of today.  And, the acting is not bad, either.
The DVD transfers are scratchy but still very viewable.  Not many extras, though.",1059955200,18,905,4.475609756097561
1234560,3,B00000JMOP,"The film: This Indiana Jones-type of movie put Fritz Lang on the map. It features the same mix of exotic locations and rollercoaster-action scenes like the Paramount-franchise from the 80ies. Alas, the film also shows that  Fritz Lang had not yet reached the level of maturity and precision that is  so prominetly featured in his later silent masterworks. Ok, the sets look  great but the story is even more hokey than your usual adventure yarn. Even  worse, the film features far too many of those scenes which are often done  but work the least in a silent movie: shoot-outs. So I'm afraid I can  recommend this film mostly to film-history-buffs (like me) or people that  need all of Lang's films on their DVD-shelf. If you want to see why Lang is  regarded as such a genius, you better check out ""Die Nibelungen""  or ""Dr. Mabuse, The Gambler"".  The DVD: The film is very rare,  and it shows: The people who restored it couldn't work with the best  film-material but had to use what they got and so the print is quite  scratchy and generally worn-out. But this is your only chance to see it, so  let that not hinder you. Otherwise, besides some notes on the film-makers,  there's not very much regarding extras on this DVD. One final,  international note: It's a shame that this German film is not available at  all in Germany, so congratulations to David and Kimberly Shepard who  uncovered this long-believed lost film!",961027200,54,1423,4.6923076923076925

7912603,3,B00000JMOP,"The Spiders is the 1919 silent film that established Fritz Lang as a master of epic storytelling, which would be on view eight years later in Metropolis. The Spiders reflects Langs fascination with Asian culture. International adventurer Kay Hoog (Carl de Vogt) finds a message in a bottle floating in San Francisco Bay that tells of a hidden Incan city filled with gold and includes a map to its location. He sets out in search of the treasure, which includes the precious Buddhas Head diamond. Along the way, he must contend with an organization of criminal spies known as The Spiders, who will employ any form of treachery, including murder, to snatch the artifacts from his possession.

Think of The Spiders as a forerunner of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It has exotic locations, plenty of action, priceless archaeological artifacts, a nefarious organization determined to snatch them away, and an intelligent hero ready to fight to preserve them.

 The movie is accompanied by music composed and conducted by Ben Model. Silent films were never shown dead silent. There was always music to accompany them  full orchestras in first-run theaters in large cities, an organist or at least a piano player matching music to on-screen action. Models score nicely enhances the action scenes.

At 173 minutes, the film is far too long, and viewers will have to accustom themselves to a much slower pace than contemporary pictures. The soundtrack is in stereo and the print features color tinting.

7912604,4,B00000JMOP,"(This review is for the Kino DVD version.) All I knew of this movie before I watched it was that it was an ""Indiana Jones""-type story produced in 1919 directed by Fritz Lang. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was curious enough to purchase it and view it. I was truly amazed with this. Even though it is only the first two parts of a planned four-part serial, and even though the film jumps from time to time and is ""jerky"" at times and has scratches, blemishes and fades, this is a very enjoyable film. I was surprised at the special effects and stunts that were used in this 1919 adventure, but if a person looks even further back, special effects were nothing new. D.W. Griffith and others had used them in films before this one. Here, our hero parachutes out of a hot-air balloon, manhandles a huge snake, and escapes death several times, at least once in a chamber being flooded with water. The plot of the first story has our hero racing to beat the ""Spiders"" (a group of crooks) to a treasure in South America, while the second adventure is a race between the two rivals to find a pirate's treasure. This is a real treat for those of you who enjoy SILENT movies. It is not what I would call a polished film, though; it's fairly rough around the edges. I wouldn't suggest it to someone who is new to silents---break yourself in on some Chaplin, Keaton, or if you like adventure, try Douglas Fairbanks, and get a feel for silents. They require a bit more attention and discipline to watch, and this one even more so.",1439164800,5,1521,4.397163120567376
