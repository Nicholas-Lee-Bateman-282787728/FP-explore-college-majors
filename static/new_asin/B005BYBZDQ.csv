4649844,5,B005BYBZDQ,"This is another great set that the WWE has put out.  I think the big question is whether this one lives up to the original Ladder match release and the answer in my opinion is no it doesn't but not by much.  This is a great set but there are some choices that leaves you scratching your head as to why it was ever put on the set.  Let's get into the review.  The first match is one that has been released many many times and is considered the ""godfather"" of ladder matches:  Shawn Michaels vs Razor Ramon at Wrestlemania 10.  This is a great match but did we need it on another set again?  Probably not.  I do like the match though and it made Shawn a superstar but I actually liked their Summerslam match better.  The next one is a rare match from Smokey Mountain Wrestling with Tracey Smothers going against Chris Candido.  Honestly, don't even waste your time.  This match is awful and if you watch the match you're kind of left wondering why they even need a ladder.  There's a card that is connected to a string above the ring (it's held in place by a clothes pin) and the card is so close to the ring that Smothers could really jump and grab the card to win the match.  Not worth watching.  The next match is the ladder match for the US title between Syxx and Eddie Guerrero from Souled Out 1997.  This match has been shown a lot too but it's good.  I've heard both Eddie and Syxx really tear into this match as being God awful but I don't see it.  I think this match is good and some of the camera angles are actually pretty cool as well.  Up next is Mankind vs Bossman for the Hardcore title.  This match is ok not too good.  The next one is Mankind vs Rock for the world title.  This is a better match then the previous one.  Honestly, in all of the great speciality matches that Mick Foley can excel in I think the ladder match is one that he really has some trouble with.  Thankfully, the Rock is in here to help him out and save this one from being boring.  The next one is one that I like as it's Shane and Vince McMahon vs Steve Austin for the CEO position of WWE.  This is a pretty good and has some funny moments in it.  It's not fabulous but when you consider that you have a 50 some year old man in there with a guy like Austin that has really never done ladder matches then it's pretty incredible the match that they gave us.  The next one is one that I was looking forward to seeing between 3 count and the Jung Dragons.  This one disappoints big time.  Just not that good and really this one should have been better.  The last match is Edge and Christian against the Hardy's on Raw for the tag titles.  Again this match just sucks and that's hard for me to say that considering that you have ladder match royalty in this one.  I think the problem is bad booking as the night before this match they had that great cage match at Unforgiven in 2000 and it hurt them so much that this was the best they could do.  Disc 2 is a little better.  It starts with RVD against Jeff Hardy for IC title and European title to unify them.  This match is ok but it is short so they really don't get a lot of time to do anything meaningful.  Up next is a lost classic between Team Angle and Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri.  This one is just awesome from start to finish.  I loved seeing Tajiri in this one especially.  Lots of great spots and innovative moves is what i like about this one.  Next we get RVD and Christian for the IC title on Raw.  This is another killer match from start to finish.  Then we get a very different match as it features the Divas.  This one is with Beth Pheonix against Katie Lea for the undisputed OVW Women's title.  This match suprises as it is actually pretty good.  There isn't any really big spots but it keeps me entertained and that's what I like.  Then we get the Money in the Bank match from Wrestlemania 23.  This match is off the chart good with so many spots and so much going on that at times it is hard to keep track.  Still, in front of over 80,000 people these 8 guys took this match and owned it.  Up next we get the Hardy's against the World's Greatest Tag Team for the WWE tag titles.  This is another steller match and why shouldn't it be?  I mean you got Jeff Hardy and Shelton Benjamin in the same match, what more should you expect.  Lastly on disc 2 you get Jeff Hardy against Carlito for the IC title on Raw.  When I first saw this match as it happened I didn't know what to expect cause of Carlito who can be on some nights and off just the same on others.  But, this is a stellar match with some pretty cool spots.  I think disc 2 may be the best disc on the set.  Disc 3 is good too though and starts out with a great match between Undertaker and Edge from One Night Stand in a TLC match with the title and Taker's career on the line.  You know Taker hasn't been in too many of these matches but when he is they are actually pretty good.  This is a good match with some pretty good spots in it.  Next we get one that I was looking forward to seeing between Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels for the world title.  Honestly, this match is just a substandard match and that kills me to say cuz you have two of the best to ever compete in the ring.  There was nothing new or interesting in this match.  I did like the ending of the match and I liked that Jericho got a tooth knocked out in the match, otherwise, the match is just ok.  Next we get the MitB ladder match from Wrestlemania 25 and this was a good one as well.  I remember watching this one live and thinking to myself how Kofi Kingston is stealing the show and he's probably going to win the MitB.  Even though he doesn't I still find myself cheering for him to get the briefcase.  Up next is the Raw MitB match from the MitB PPV in 2010.  This is a good match but it just kills me that Miz won.  Still though, good spots and great competitors.  I actually love the next match as John Morrison takes on Sheamus in a number 1 contender match.  This match is ultra good from start to finish with some sick spots in it from Morrison.  I was worried about Sheamus in this one but he actually does a very good job in it.  Lastly we get Christian against Alberto del Rio for the world heavyweight title at Extreme Rules 2011.  This is a good match and has a real nice feel good moment in it when Christian wins the belt.  Great match

All in all this sequel to the first ladder match set is a good set but I don't think it's quite as good as the first set.  See, the first set had a lot of Hardy matches and E and C matches and that's sadly missing from this set to make it good.  However, it is a good set.  The Blu Ray extras are 4 more matches that are ok but not great.  I do think that the WWE should have cut the SMW match, the Raw match with Hardys against E and C and some others but the match selection is very good.  I do think that WWE needs to think about a 3rd set and in it they need the taser match from Souled Out 1999 with Scott Hall and Goldberg going at it, the 2 or 3 Stairway to Hell matches that ECW had and some from Stampede as well maybe the one that Bret Hart had with Dynamite Kid.  Also, there was one that I remember from NWA between Tully Blanchard and Dusty Rhodes that they could put on there as well.  We could call that Ladder Match:  The Lost Matches.  Think about WWE.",1322006400,2,7313,4.073684210526316
4649845,5,B005BYBZDQ,"As I stated in the title of my review for the first DVD set of ""The Ladder Match"", this is one of the most innovative matches of all time to the point where it has spun off into so many different types of matches such as King Of The Mountain in TNA, Stairway To Hell In ECW, Money In The Bank, and T.L.C./Full Metal Mayhem. Since that set, this match has caused WWE to push the envelope even more to the point where two pay per views each year are based around this match (""Money In The Bank"" & ""T.L.C.: Tables, Ladders, Chairs"") so here's another collection of matches that were either missed the first time or happened in the four year period after the release of Volume One.

WWE Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels - This was the first ladder match to be seen on WWE television. Both men started off wrestling early before Diesel got involved & ended up paying for it before Razor removed the outside mat & exposed the concrete that didn't end up working in his favor. The ladder came into play from here as Shawn started to use it as a weapon to attack Razor's ribs starting with a baseball slide into the ladder right into Razor's ribs & later doing a big splash off the top of it while later Razor used it to his advantage by whipping Shawn into it & using it squish Shawn into the ringpost. There were times when both men launched an attack while one was on the ladder much as Razor slamming Shawn off of it & him ""making an ass"" of Shawn to prevent him from winning the match. This ladder match was the one that set the standard for what WWE would do this match for years to come as it was definitely a match where both men came out stronger than they went in with Jerry Lawler to the point said about one competitor, ""He Is Superman!""

[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; History Of Intercontinental Championship]

Tracy Smothers vs. Chris Candido - This match was for $2,500 hung in an envelope over the ring & they started wrestling like this was a regular match with Smothers constantly kicking Candido out of the ring so he could attempt to climb the match. The ladder started to come into play when Candido got his head caught in the ladder & thrown into the post for it to bounce in-between the steps, Chris using the ladder as a weapon for him to choke Smothers before later slamming Smothers on it while he later was a victim of the ladder by missing a top rope splash onto it. This wasn't much as far as spots go & really nothing special.
""Smoky Mountain Wrestling"" Mar. 94

WCW United States Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Syxx - This match was Eddie's first ladder match from the nWo's first (and only) PPV ""nWo Souled Out"" and this was one of the highlights from that PPV. Eddie was going for revenge against the man who stole his United States Championship from him in the Syxx (1-2-3 Kid/X-Pac). This wasn't the best ladder match in history but far from the worse as well as this was more of a wrestling match featuring a ladder instead of what you would usually expect in a ladder match. As Eddie said in his commentary before his ladder match with RVD on his first DVD set, he didn't think this match wasn't that good...and he had a point as this was a good wrestling match featuring a ladder but didn't match up to the standards to set by previous & future ladder matches in wrestling.

[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

Hardcore Champion Mankind vs. Big Boss Man - Boss Man was a member of Mr. McMahon's ""The Corporation"" stable at the time & his job here was to take away the only thing Mankind had left in his Hardcore Championship while it should be noted that Shawn Michaels was the Commissioner at the time & did commentary at ringside. Mankind was attacked by Boss Man on the floor right away with the nightstick before he was able to recover & used the steps & the ladder on Boss Man. Foley was able to use the ladder to his advantage various times such as dropping elbow drops while Boss Man was wedged inside & even doing a clothesline off it at one point but overall, this was more about pushing the story of the The Corporation continuing to screw Mankind while further push his feud with The Rock than anything else as this was more of a hardcore match than an actual ladder match.
""RAW"" Nov. 98

WWE Champion Mankind vs. The Rock - After countless encounters over the previous months including such matches as ""I Quit"" & Last Man Standing & fights in an empty arena, this was their final encounter for the WWE Championship with the winner going into the title match against Steve Austin (who was also on commentary for this match. Mankind came into the match with a bad leg from the night before & they started this match on the floor with Rock targeting the legs right away by throwing Mankind into the steps legs first before slamming it into a chair multiple times. The ladder was brought into play by The Rock only for Mankind to start using it as a weapon by nailing it with a chair multiple times while Rock was trapped underneath but Rock continued to work over Mankind's bad knee to prevent him from climbing including hitting the ladder with a chair while his leg was wedged in-between & constantly hitting it with a chair whenever Mankind tried to climb. They took the fight to the outside brawling through the crowd before making their way back ringside & through the announce table but it was a ""big nasty"" presence that was the difference maker in the end.

Steve Austin vs. Vince & Shane McMahon - During this time, Mr. McMahon revealed himself to be the ""Higher Power"" behind The Corporate Ministry only for Linda & Stephanie McMahon to quickly reveal that they gave their ownership of WWE to Steve Austin setting up this match with a briefcase at stake (where have I seen this recently?) containing the paperwork for complete ownership of the WWE. Austin attacked both men in the isleway early before taking the fight to the stage area where Austin dominated to the point where he literally ""brought the house down."" With the use of the announce tables & some mysterious interference, this wasn't the type of ladder match you would expect from people like the Hardys, Dudleys, or Edge & Christian but it was a brawl that you would expect from Stone Cold with some comedic moments & being able to take a beating that you would expect from both McMahon's.

Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count - The rules for this ladder match was that both 3 Count's golden record & their recording contract must be taken to win the match while it should be noted during this time that former MMA competitor Tank Abbott was playing a role of the biggest 3 Count fan including wearing their shirts & dancing while they perform while Evan came into this match with a brace on his ankle from injuring it in another ladder match on Nitro a short time earlier (which is available on ""Best Of WCW Nitro"" DVD). Knowing that both teams in this match were high flying crusierweights, we got a bunch of various spots & moments throughout the match such as Yang backdropping Shannon onto a ladder, Kaz slammed on top of Jamieson on the ladder straddled in the corner, Jamieson's giant leap off a ladder onto 3 Count on the floor, the various unique ways of knocking someone off the ladder including a neckbreaker & vertical suplex, Kaz being powerslammed on a ladder, dual splashes by the Dragons off ladders onto Shannon before he was later powerbombed off a ladder. This match topped their previous ladder match on Nitro only for them to continue to top this with their ladder match at Starrcade months later but this match definitely stole the show at this PPV.
WCW New Blood Rising 00

WWE Tag Team Champions Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - Nice to see WWE finally remembered that this match happened & released it onto DVD after over a decade. A couple of notes here in that this was on the debut of RAW on TNN (later SpikeTV), happened the night after their steel cage match at the Unforgiven PPV so everyone came in battered & bruised, and would be the last title match for Edge & Christian during this title reign of the Hardy Boyz. This match was exactly what you would expect from both teams with such highlights as a baseball side into the ladder that had every man watch feeling the pain, Christian sacrificing himself to hurt Jeff, Edge reliving a highlight moment between him & Jeff, Lita getting involved with a chair, Matt Hardy bleeding, Edge doing a clothesline off the ladder onto the outside, Christian being back suplexed off the ladder before Edge was later powerbombed off the ladder, and two sets of ladders being tipped over with once again every man watching being in pain after seeing how the wrestlers on them landed. It's not as memorable as their other encounters but not lacking quality.
""RAW"" Sept. 00

WWE Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam vs. WWE European Champion Jeff Hardy - This was a unification title match as both men started wrestling early with RVD even going for a pin out of instinct. The ladder was brought in quickly with RVD being the first to use it with a baseball slide into Hardy followed by a somersault off the apron onto Jeff before taking a nasty bump on his own as he was yanked off the ladder by Hardy so hard that he fell face first followed by both men then went for other ladders at ringside resulting in a duel ladder fight. Both men took some very hard hits here such as RVD's rolling thunder onto Jeff Hardy laying on a ladder, Jeff back suplexing RVD off the ladder followed by a swanton bomb off a ladder, RVD flip powerbombing Jeff Hardy off a ladder, RVD kicking the ladder from underneath Hardy who definitely ""crashed & burned"", followed by a huge frog splash. I enjoyed this better than their previous ladder match years earlier.
""RAW"" July 02
[History Of Intercontinental Championship]

WWE Tag Team Champions Team Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri - This was originally scheduled to be Los Guerreros teaming together but Chavo was injured before this match leading to Tajiri replacing him. The match started off with a bang right away as Team Angle had the strategy of divide & conquer by throwing Eddie into the ladder in the isleway right away to work over Tajiri who was able to recover doing a handspring elbow onto ladder knocking off both Hass & Benjamin followed by both him & Eddie delivering a dropkick to the ladder that had every man in the building feeling Hass' pain. Eddie pulled out some unique moves of his own like a hilo over the top rope onto Team Angle who were sandwitched between the ladders before Shelton was able to give Eddie a powerslam into the ladder on the corner. Eddie delivered out some more punishment like monkeyflipping Shelton into Hass who was holding a ladder, his frop splash off the top of the ladder & later executing a flip powerbomb. Although Eddie was the only person in the match with ladder match experience in WWE, everyone in here gave a quality performance.
Judgment Day 03

WWE Intercontinental Champion Christian vs. Rob Van Dam - Christian was in control early before RVD was able to regain momentum with his baseball slide into a ladder & somersault over the ropes onto Christian & the ladder followed by his spinning kick onto Christian laying on the ladder. Christian gave a hard irish whip onto RVD into the ladder in the corner before RVD countered showing some strength of his own by pressing Christian onto the ladder followed by a backwards flip. Hard hits were taken by both men such as Christian being monkeyflipped into a ladder, RVD landing on a ladder after missing the frog splash, and Christian falling & hitting a ladder face first.
""RAW"" Sept. 03
[Rob Van Dam: One Of A Kind]

Undisputed OVW Women's Championship: Katie Lea vs. Beth Phoenix - Katie Lee started this off with a bang as she jumped off the ladder onto Beth on the outside right from the start followed by ramming her into the ladder. Both ladies pulled out some moments of their own such as Katie delivering a top rope dropkick onto Beth's leg while climbing the ladder, Beth falling face first off the ladder, Katie slammed onto the ladder, Beth missing a top rope splash onto the ladder, Katie having the ladder dropkicked right into her chin, and Katie delivering one hell of a ""rude awakening"" onto Beth off the ladder. This is a rare encounter here as I can rarely recall ladder matches featuring females but this was definitely a treat as they took some punishment that even some men have never done in this type of match.
""OVW"" Dec. 06

Money in the Bank Ladder Match: Edge vs. Randy Orton vs. King Booker vs. Finlay vs. Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy vs. C.M. Punk vs. Mr. Kennedy...Kennedy (sorry, I had to do that) - Damn, they knew how to kick this PPV off in style and this was the best Money In The Bank match to date. Not every participant was able to get a ""highlight reel"" spot but everyone held their own & was able make this the one of the best matches of the night. Some great moments to look out for where Edge's elimination from the match thanks to Jeff Hardy, Randy Orton receiving the Bookend off the ladder, and even Finlay's Hornswaggle getting in on some of the action...plus the return of the spinarooni!!!!
WrestleMania 23

World Tag Team Champions The Hardys vs. World's Greatest Tag Team - Knowing the Hardys reputation in ladder matches with this being Jeff's 4th ladder match & Matt's 3rd in under a year along with Shelton's showstealing performances in the first two Money In The Bank along with him & Hass' outstanding performance in their ""forgotten"" ladder match again Tajiri & Eddie Guerrero...you just knew this was going to be the match of the night which it was. The match started out as a brawl then the ladders were brought into play to make moves more high impact such as Hass being slammed off the top rope onto the ladder, Shelton being backdropped on one lying on the ring apron, and the Hardys shoving Hass & Benjamin off the ladder with Shelton going over the top rope & hitting a ladder on the way down.
One Night Stand 07

WWE Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Carlito - This was on RAW's 15th Anniversary Show & Carlito's first ladder match in WWE (not sure if he's had one in Puerto Rico or anywhere else). Carlito hit Hardy with the ladder early before Jeff fought back & dropkicked Carlito off the apron onto the ladder lying on the rail. For his first ladder match, Carlito took some nasty bumps like doing a sunset flip powerbomb on Hardy off the ladder & later being backdropped on the ladder while also working over Jeff's leg including wedging it in-between the ladder. This isn't one of those ladder matches that will stand the test of time but was still a good encounter.
""RAW"" Dec. 07
[Jeff Hardy: My Rules, My Life]

World Championship/T.L.C. Match vs. Undertaker - After Taker was stripped the championship months earlier & their last match still didn't determine a new champion, they met here in Edge's specialty match of T.L.C. match which was also the first time Taker has been in this type of match & only the second ladder match in his career as both men were evenly matched as one would use the ladder to their advantage like hitting the top of the ladder face first, going into a ladder setup in the corner only, and later a low blow only for the other to deliver a receipt with the same move. Taker took the advantage using a ladder & chair on Edge but Edge used a chair to block his trademark apron legdrop regaining control with various chairshots while also delivering a splash off one table through another one before Taker came back putting Edge through a ladder on the outside & later a Last Ride off the ladder through stacked tables resulting in members of La Familia coming out to try to help Edge but ended up causalities of the tables & ladders & chairs themselves before one of the took the ultimate fall off a ladder that they couldn't get up from. This was the highlight reel carnage that you expect from this type of match with tables being destroyed, chairs being damages, and the ladders being used for impact.
One Night Stand: Extreme Rules '08
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence]

World Champion Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels - This was a different type of ladder match than we're used to seeing...and that's a good thing. Just like their previous matches like the Unsanctioned Match at Unforgiven, this was more about each man trying to beat the hell out of each other with the ladder making moves more impactful instead of pulling off a bunch of cool looking high spots. Couple of moments to look for was when Jericho took a fall off the ladder straight to the floor that we normally see except he didn't have tables to break his fall and one hit with the ladder right to the fact that resulted in one of his teeth getting knocked out. Fun match with both men (innovators of this match in their own rights) setting a different standard for a ladder match.

[Breaking The Code: Behind The Walls Of Chris Jericho]

Money in the Bank Ladder Match: C.M. Punk vs. Kane vs. M.V.P. vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Finlay vs. Christian vs. Mark Henry vs. Shelton Benjamin - After the last couple of MITB ladder matches starting to become a little ""routine"" when it came to the spots, this one had the ladders used in ways we've never seen before in more unique ways. Moments to look out for are the showcases of strength by Mark Henry & Kane, Christian clearly being the crowd favorite, Shelton Benjamin's leap off the ladder outside the ring, Hornswoggle & his ""ladder"", and the darkhorse (no pun intended) in Kofi Kingston being the human highlight reel of the match. There were some botches for the stuff they were trying to pull off but overall, entertaining match & great way to kick off the show.
WrestleMania 25

Money in the Bank Ladder Match: Evan Bourne vs. John Morrison vs. Randy Orton vs. Mark Henry vs. The Miz vs. Ted DiBiase vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge - This match was different than the earlier ladder match in that it had more brawling in the match but still had various moments such as Mark Henry ""parting the red sea"" with two ladders, Maryse making an attempt to climb the ladder, John Morrison having an innovative way to get on the ladder to stop Edge & eventually getting trapped between an open ladder, Mark Henry delivering various World's Strongest Slams along with Randy Orton giving out RKO's out of nowhere, Henry dropping Miz on top a ladder...that was on top of Chris Jericho, Henry being taken out thanks to a series of signature moves, up to 5 men climbing up a ladder at once, Orton delivering an RKO right before being on the receiving end of Air Bourne, Edge's nasty fall off a ladder onto another open ladder...that was upside down, and the aftermath with Miz winning the match but breaking character by getting real emotional.
Money in the Bank 10

John Morrison vs. Sheamus - This was the ""rubber"" match between the two with Morrison winning at Survivor Series while Sheamus defeated Morrison afterwords to become King Of The Ring. You saw various spots & highlight moments such as Morrison's corkscrew dive over a ladder, a dueling ladder fight, and both falling off the ladder over the top rope to the ringside floor with Sheamus crashing through a ladder on the way down. Along with these moments came a great story being told with Morrison hurting his knee with Sheamus punishing & focusing on it non-stop throughout the match using the ladder along with out moves like snapping Morrison over his back via his leg. Anyone who's seen their series of matches for the past few months (look up the ""Falls Count Anywhere"" from RAW back in Sept.) knows that these two go hard & deliver quality with this being no exception. I wouldn't go as far as to put this ladder match in the same level as Shawn/Razor from WrestleMania X but definitely on the level of Rock/Triple H from SummerSlam '98 as a standout performance for both mens career.
T.L.C.: Tables, Ladders, Chairs 10

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio - For those who don't already know, Edge was forced to retire the week after WrestleMania & forfeited the World Championship in the process setting up this ladder match between the two top challengers. There were plenty of spots (as expected) in this type of match such as Christian falling face first into a ladder after his legs were pulled from under him, Del Rio dropped arm first into a ladder & later using a ""Hornswoggle"" sized ladder to execute a armbreaker onto Christian off another ladder, a ladder wedged between the ring apron & the announce table resulting in Del Rio taking a very nasty landing on his spine, the appearance of Brodus Clay resulting in him having his own pool of blood on the outside, Del Rio doing a variation of his cross armbreaker using the stepladder, and the appearance of a ""Rated R"" jeep leading to a moment that a solid core group of fans have been waiting a long time to happen...at least in WWE.
Extreme Rules 11

(Blu-Ray) World Champion Edge vs. Jeff Hardy - I'll give credit in that they've tried to do what Jericho/Michaels did at No Mercy in delivering a different type of ladder match than the usual ""non-stop spotfest"" that we're used to seeing. They tried to find new ways to use the ladder in this match along with revisiting old ""highlight reel"" spots from all their previous ladder matches. Again, it was a good match but it wasn't the blowaway classic everyone was expecting...but to be fair, they've set the bar so high for the past decade in regards to ladder matches that they just couldn't top it in this case. This was one of those matches where if you judge it on it's own instead of comparing it to all of their past ladder matches (I counted at least six) then it's a good match. But the major story at the end of the night was the aftermath that resulted in a new World Champion...AGAIN!
Extreme Rules 09
[History Of World Heavyweight Championship]

(Blu-Ray) ECW Champion Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin - With the ECW brand being lost in the shuffle for the past couple of PPV's (which Christian openly admitted weeks earlier), they came back with a bang here with the two men who have their own highlight reels when it comes to ladder matches. Michael Cole described this match just right in the end when he called it a ""thriller"" because you just had so many moments such as various moves done off the ladder (flying clothesline, powerslam, scorpion deathdrop) and done onto the ladder (frog splash) and one moment where Shelton showed heavy strength by catching Christian off the ladder into a powerbomb onto another one. The only thing I can really say that was negative here was when Christian got busted open at one point & the match was stopped so the EMT can attend to it leading the crowd to chant ""WE WANT BLOOD."" Despite that one negative, they did what they accomplished to do & that's steal the show.
T.L.C.: Tables, Ladders, Chairs 09
[Best PPV Matches Of 2009-2010]

(Blu-Ray) T.L.C. Match: WWE Champion The Miz vs. Jerry Lawler - As a birthday gift for Lawler, he got his first ever WWE Championship match...which also happened to be in his first T.L.C. match as well & it should be noted that C.M. Punk was on commentary during this match. This started off as a wrestling match before Miz started using the chair only for Lawler to return the favor after miscommunication from Alex Riley gave Lawler an advantage. Miz was the first one to taste the ladder before Riley paid for getting involved one too many times but Miz was able to recover & worked over Lawler's back with a suplex onto a chair & several chairshots. Lawler kept fighting back but it was the unexpected involvement of someone nobody expected that helped The Miz retain.
""RAW"" Nov. 10

(Blu-Ray) WWE Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Jack Swagger - After weeks of controversy between Kofi & Swagger over who was the rightful #1 contender for Dolph's championship, we get a triple threat ladder match. Various moments include Dolph being slingshot into a ladder, Kofi delivering a dropkick through the ladder, Dolph delivering Billy Gunn's fameasser on Kofi onto the ladder...with Swagger underneath it, Kofi attempting to climb the ladder while in Swagger's anklelock, Vickie Guerrero's involvement leading to a spat between Lawler & Cole, and Dolph intercepting a fumble. This was a fun way to kick off the show with extra credit going to Swagger for working through his hand being injured so early.
T.L.C.: Tables, Ladders, Chairs 10

The only criticisms I have in regards to this set is that (again) there was no ladder matches from ECW just like how there wasn't on the first set while some of the matches came off as filler & could have been replaced with a better quality match. One of my big pet peeves about DVD sets is having a bunch of repeats from other sets but a majority of the repeats on here were from sets that are so old (going up to almost 6 years ago) that it wasn't an issue with me here as I was overall satisfied with this follow up collection that I would recommend for those fans of this type of match.",1318896000,5,25238,4.565783664459161

King of the Ring 27th June, 1999 - For a part time wrestler, Shane-O-Mac was pretty damn good. His matches with Kurt Angle at KOTR 2001, Steve Blackman, Kane were all solid in my view. Therefore, I actually liked this. When I first saw it, I was shocked at who won.

TLC Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Undertaker vs. Edge
One Night Stand 1st June, 2008 - I REALLY, REALLY loved this match a lot! We know the expert Edge in ladder matches. But the commentators always talk about how Taker evolves and adapts. And he did that here as he had only been in one other ladder match before this & it was with one of Edge's other great rivals, a fellow ladder match expert in Jeff Hardy. The end with all the table spots were done very, very well. This was really a great rivalry. I wish it continued past SSlam. Instead, Taker was stuck with Big Show following his feud with The Ultimate Opportunist a.k.a. Edge.

Ladder Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels
No Mercy 5th October, 2008 - Both of these great athletes have been in better ladder matches. But that's not to take anything from this because it was damn good and a good way to put their feud on hold. The HBK/Jericho rivalry would make an excellent Rivalry DVD.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
CM Punk vs. Kane vs. Mark Henry vs. MVP vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Finlay vs. Christian
WrestleMania 25 5th April, 2009 - Not a bad match. But this should have been replaced by the SD MITB match from MITB 2010 or the WM24 MITB match.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
The Miz vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Evan Bourne vs. Ted DiBiase vs. John Morrison vs. Edge vs. Mark Henry
Money in the Bank 18th July, 2010 - I'm happy this match is here because it was a great, great ladder bout. But I'm curious as to why the SD MITB isn't here. Aren't these Ladder dvd's supposed to have every Ladder match in WWE???

#1 Contender's Ladder Match for the WWE Championship
John Morrison vs. Sheamus
TLC 19th December, 2010 - Match of the night at TLC 2010, one of the best matches of both men;s careers, match that made John Morrison, and one of best matches on this entire set. Definitely high on my Best Ladder Matches list.

Ladder Match for the Vacant World Heavyweight Championship
Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio
Extreme Rules 1st May, 2011 - Christian really showed why he has been underrated and overlooked (and still is to some, though somewhat of a lesser degree) for his entire WWE/WWF run. What a great match here!

Blu-Ray Extras (These should have made the DVD cut.)

Ladder Match for World Heavyweight Championship
Edge vs. Jeff Hardy
Extreme Rules 7th June, 2009 - I could not think of a more fitting way to end the Jeff Hardy/Edge rivalry. This was one of the BEST ladder matches I have seen.

Ladder Match for the ECW Championship
Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin
TLC 13th December, 2009 - Match Of The Might at TLC 2009. That pretty much says it all. Watch this whether you've seen it already or not.

TLC Match for WWE Championship
The Miz vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler
Raw 29th November, 2010 - When I first heard this match would happen, I was like ""OMG. WTF?? Lawler in a Ladder Match???"" due to his age and the fact that he hardly wrestles these days. Plus, I've never seen him in a Ladder match so I don't know if he's ever been in them or not. In addition to that, it was clear that this match served to begin to overly long Lawler/Cole feud. However, despite all of that, this was a hard worked match. I was really proud of Lawler here. IMO, his best effort in some time.

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Jack Swagger
TLC 19th December, 2010 - Not a bad match. Effort was definitely there. While I did like it, nothing at TLC 2010 could top Morrison/Sheamus so I'm glad these three didn't try to top that.

As I said before, definitely worth having in your collection if you're a Ladder match fan. Others I would've added (if they aren't on the first Ladder match dvd): Rey vs Eddie from SSlam 2005, Jeff Hardy vs CM Punk from SSlam 2009, Cena vs Edge from Unforgiven 2006, Jericho vs Christian from Unforgiven 2004, RVD vs Eddie Guererro",1318377600,2,7211,4.511128165771297

4649910,3,B005BYBZDQ,"The 1st Ladder Match DVD set, released in 2007, was not only an outstanding introduction to the ladder match concept; it was one of the best wrestling DVD sets of all time. There was an ungodly amount of spectacular, high-quality matches on that set that showed how the ladder match was constantly redefined and reinvented throughout the years. Naturally, there were still a lot of good ladder matches missing and this 2nd set attempts to right that wrong by including matches not shown on the previous set. This set also has the advantage of being hosted by Christian, a WWE superstar no stranger to ladder matches.

Unfortunately, what seemed good in theory proves disappointing in execution. To be fair, most of the classic ladder matches already existed in the 1st set, but the choice of matches for THIS set is a real head-scratcher to say the least. There are a number of very good-great matches here, but then you got to deal with a bunch of mediocre ones that have not stood the test of time. So let's climb this ladder and see what we got here.

Ladder Match for the Undisputed Intercontinental Championship
Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon
WrestleMania X, March 20, 1994

-One of the biggest complaints in the first set was that this match wasn't included. But it's here and it's still as good today as it was nearly 20 years ago. There may have been more ladder matches beforehand, but this was the one that put it on the map. While the SS 1995 rematch had greater drama, this one was better choreographed and more memorable. The spots are as vicious as the ones in the TLC matches and it still gets you pumped up, no matter how many times you've seen it. One of the greatest and most influential matches of all time. (*****).

Ladder Match for $2,500
Tracy Smothers vs. Chris Candido
Smoky Mountain Wrestling, March 1994

-I guess they wanted to include ladder matches from other territories besides WWE and WCW. I was genuinely surprised at this match, given the negative reviews it has received; it was actually better than I anticipated. But I agree with everyone that said that this was not a true representative of the ladder match concept. There are some intriguing spots, including the ladder wrapped around Candido's head and tossed against the turnbuckle and Smothers delivering a crescent kick that caused Candido to land head first on the ladder, but other than that, they could have wrestled without a ladder and no one would have noticed. It was good, but nothing special and not a true representative of the ladder match. (**)

Ladder Match for WCW United States Championship
Eddie Guerrero vs. Syxx
Souled Out, January 25, 1997

-One of the matches that I felt was excluded from the 1st ladder set appears here. This was from the infamous nWo Souled Out 1997, which was the height of nWo excess, where everything from the ceiling banner to the ringside were covered in nWo logos and colors; even the commentators were nWo members. Needless to say, they never did this sort of thing again, which showed you how much it bombed. The match, however, is anything but a bomb, as Eddie and Syxx delivered a good ladder match that featured inventive ladder spots, including Eddie see-sawing the ladder in Syxx's face, Eddie hotshot on the ladder and Syxx using the ladder as a platform to dropkick Eddie off the top. There were some moments that Eddie and Syxx were off and the commentary can grate the nerve, but there is enough good stuff to make this worth a watch.
(****)

Ladder Match for the WWE Hardcore Championship
Mankind vs. Big Boss Man
Raw, November 30, 1998

-Talk about a bizarre pick. This was the beginning of the Corporation angle where the McMahons and the Rock battled against Steve Austin, Mick Foley and DX. This was a standard RAW match that has not aged well at all. There's even an awful spot where Foley drops the ladder on Boss Man outside and the ladder clearly hits the canvas first. On the bright side, Shawn Michaels' audio commentary provides a lot of good laughs. Foley basically did most of the work, until the Rock interfered and the match disintegrated into a mess. Amusing match for the nostalgic fans, but nothing more. (**)

Ladder Match for the WWE Championship
Mankind vs. The Rock
Raw, February 15, 1999

-The final match of the memorable Mankind/Rock feud in 1999 before the Rock's rivalry with Austin. They even include the Rock's entertaining pre-match promo. This was a typically good, exciting brawl (albeit under ladder match rules) where the Rock and Foley took it all over the arena, until the Rock delivered a rock-bottom through the table. I don`t know why, but seeing Rock rock-bottom somebody through a table never gets old. Comedy highlight is Foley delivering his own version of the ""Corporate Elbow"". No contrived ""ladder climbing"" drama; just a good old-fashioned street fight by these two, ending with the Big Show helping give the Rock the title. Great way to end their feud. (***).

Handicap Ladder Match for Control of the WWE
Shane & Vince McMahon vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin
King of the Ring, June 27, 1999

-Are you serious? Why in the world did they include THIS match? This match, of course, was the culmination of the god-awful Higher Power angle where Vince was revealed as the mastermind behind the Corporate Ministry. To even the odds, Vince's wife Linda made Steve Austin the CEO. To settle this, Austin and the McMahons would fight it out in the ladder match for control of the company. Anyone who considers the Attitude Era to be ""the golden age of wrestling"" should be made to watch this embarrassingly awful match, where Austin apparently can't put down two shrimpy McMahons and just climb the ladder in a few minutes. Then in one of most insulting endings in wrestling history, Austin climbs up to grab the briefcase and an unknown assailant raises the briefcase up and down to make sure Austin doesn't win. The worst part? We never find out who was responsible, not even today. The only highlight of the match was Austin destroying the McMahons at the entrance and dropping all the ladder props on top of them. Within a month afterwards, Austin won the WWE title and retired McMahon at Fully Loaded 1999, rendering the match (and the whole angle) pointless. Horrible match. (*)

Ladder Match for 3 Count's Golden Record and Recording Contract
3 Count vs. Jung Dragons
New Blood Rising, August 13, 2000

-You've got to be kidding me. The WrestleMania 2000 triangle ladder match was passed over for THIS? Ugh. The match here is for (and I kid you not) 3 Count's Golden Record and their recording contract. And people wonder why WCW no longer exist. This match was just painful to watch as they started as a regular tag team match (under LADDER MATCH RULES!!!) and performed some of the sloppiest and most laughable spots ever conceived in a wrestling ring, including a failed backdrop on the ladder and 3 count's Shannon Moore leapfrogging on top of all 3 Jung Dragons on a ladder. The Jung Dragons even rip-off the Hardy Boyz with laughably dueling splashes off the ladder. Adding insult to the stupidity, Tank Abbott, who was not in the match, interferes and grabs the golden record, making a joke out of the match. This atrocity thankfully ends when Evan Karagias grabs the contract. God bless Vince Russo, for making a mockery out of one of the most treasured gimmick matches of all time. (*).

Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships
Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz
Raw, September 25, 2000

-Like a breath of fresh air from those two previous duds, this little gem has been forgotten in the history books until now. The match, stipulated as E&C's last title shot as long as the Hardyz were champs, is like a condensed version of the ladder matches these two teams have had in the past. This was a well-choreographed match, even if it lacks the pacing of their previous battles. It was also the 1st time that Edge performed a spear off the ladder onto someone hanging from the belts. These teams clearly had better matches, but it's was nice that WWE finally recognized it after all these years. (***).

Ladder Match to Unify the Intercontinental and European Championship
Rob Van Dam vs. Jeff Hardy
Raw, July 22, 2002

-I really wish they included the SummerSlam 2001 match, in which the match was longer and had more devastating spots. As the title suggests, this match unifies the Intercontinental and European championships. No disrespect, but I'm glad they got rid of the European belt as it was a useless title and had as much value as tin can. Despite some nice spots, the match was hampered by the short length and Jeff Hardy's general sloppiness, including a lousy backdrop suplex off the ladder that JR mistook for a Russian leg sweep. Okay TV match, but their SS2001 match was far superior and I wish they included THAT instead of this. (**)

Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships
Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri vs. Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas
Judgment Day, May 18, 2003

-This is from Judgment Day 2003, a candidate for worst wrestling PPV of all time. Unsurprisingly, this was the best match of the card and it also marked the beginning of Eddie Guerrero's babyface run. Eddie's partner Chavo Guerrero got injured, so Tajiri became his replacement. I would have personally picked Rey Mysterio, but what you see is what you get. There were some pretty rough moments as Shelton & Charlie clearly looked uncomfortable in this type of match, but minor quibbles aside, the match delivered the goods as there were a lot of sweet spots, including Tajiri's handspring elbow on the ladder, Shelton's T-Bone suplex on the ladder and Shelton & Charlie's leapfrog double-team with the ladder. Eddie and Tajiri win the belts when Tajiri spits the green mist on Shelton, giving Eddie the victory. (***)

Ladder Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship
Christian vs. Rob Van Dam
Raw, September 29, 2003

-Finally, another ladder classic on the set. And get this? This is yet another match that I felt was left out of the 1st ladder match set. Christian and Rob Van Dam came into this match and literally tore the house down. These two really destroyed each other with RVD, in particular, performing pattern high-flying moves on Christian, including the five-star frog splash that he botched in his match against Eddie the previous year. In some ways, this ladder match on RAW was better, as the match felt better choreographed and the ending worked beautifully. This should have made Christian and RVD into main eventers, but at the time, it was all about Goldberg, Evolution, Brock Lesnar and Team Angle. A phenomenal classic and one of the best matches in the history of RAW. (****)

Ladder Match for the Undisputed OWW Women's Championship
Katie Lea vs. Beth Phoenix
OV W, December 23, 2006

-Now for something a little different. This is a ladder match involving WWE female wrestlers and it takes place in OVW. This was surprisingly decent, although the match was marred by the contrived slow climbing and a moment when Katie Lea botched her timing in avoiding a frog splash by Phoenix. Short and inoffensive and watching this match, you can see why the WWE brought Beth Phoenix into their roster. (**)

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
Mr. Kennedy vs. CM Punk vs. Edge vs. Finlay vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. King Booker vs. Randy Orton

The 1st of three ""Money in the Bank"" matches on this set, this is actually the third Wrestle Mania ""Money in the Bank"" match overall and also another match that I felt was excluded off the 1st set. While some may mourn the absence of the MITB match at WM22, this one is far superior, with greater pacing and lesser sloppiness. It also features one of the greatest spots in the history of the WWE - Jeff Hardy putting Edge on top of a ladder and dropping a leg from a 20-footer onto him, snapping the ladder in half. A holy s--- moment for the ages, it also, unfortunately, marked the beginning of the end for Edge's career as it had a negative long-term effect on Edge's neck. Speaking of misfortunes, this match was originally supposed to be the start of Kennedy's main event push as he was won the MITB, but he lost that and his main event push due to injuries and never reached such heights again. A spectacular train wreck and a great way to open WM23. (****)

Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships:
The Hardyz vs. Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas
One Night Stand, June 3, 2007

-I was very disappointed with this match. You had a technically sound tag team and a tag team who were masters of the ladder match and the match STILL blew. The pacing was all over the place and the timing was extremely off, especially when one team tried to take another one off the ladder. As I said before, Benjamin/Haas look very uncomfortable in a ladder match and there was a cringe-inducing moment where they tried to throw Jeff into the ladder in a drop-toe-hold position and it looked sloppy. Even their vintage leapfrog, from a ladder, didn't look right. The only spots that seemed painful were Haas' German suplex off the turnbuckle and Benjamin falling onto a ladder outside. There are worse matches on this set than this, but none that left you with a greater sense of disappointment. (**)

Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Jeff Hardy vs. Carlito
Raw, December 10, 2007

-What is this? Are they just picking ladder matches out of random? Carlito is nowhere near a worker as John Morrison or Rob Van Dam and this match shows. Jeff really tried, but Carlito's mediocrity dragged the match down, although he took some good bumps on the ladder and performed an excellent sunset-flip power bomb off of it. Not a great match, but not a disaster thanks to Jeff Hardy carrying this match. It's just okay. Still, there are better ladder matches out there that should have been on this set instead of this. (**)

Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Undertaker vs. Edge
One Night Stand, June 1, 2008

-This was in the middle of the memorable Undertaker/Edge feud, where the two had a series of ****+ matches throughout the spring and summer of 2008. The stipulation here is that if Undertaker loses, he will be fired. Sadly, this is the only TLC match on the set, but it's an excellent choice. In a welcoming change of pace, the match disregards the usual high-flying choreography of the previous matches in favor of a more methodical style and suspenseful storytelling. This was kind of like HHH/Rock and Cena/Edge matches from the 1st set where they told a great story in the ring and got the fans glued to the screen without resorting to the usual match clich&eacute;s. The shocking ending of the match is also a pleasant surprise. Really fantastic match here. (****)

Ladder Match for World Heavyweight Championship
Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels
No Mercy, October 5, 2008

-Awesome! I am so happy they included this classic here. At around the same year that Taker/Edge tore the house down on the SmackDown brand, Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels did the same on the RAW brand. To finally settle this feud once and for all, they would decide it in a ladder match at No Mercy. This match was utterly unbelievable, as Jericho and Michaels tore each other apart in a ladder match that was basically a full-fledged war. This was more about sheer brutalization than showing off a bunch of cool-looking spots and I loved every moment of it. The moment where HBK and Jericho play tug of war with the belt will linger on every wrestling fan's memories for years to come. Not just the best match of 2008, but one of the greatest matches of all time, by two men that pioneered the ladder match and redefined it again here. (****)

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
CM Punk vs. Kane vs. Mark Henry vs. MVP vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Finlay vs. Christian
WrestleMania 25, April 5, 2009

-The 2nd ""Money in the Bank"" match of the set, this one was overshadowed by the colossal Undertaker/HBK match that took place in the same night. But this match was no slouch. Kofi Kingston was truly a star here, especially how he used Mark Henry to climb up and try to grab the briefcase. Some people argue that the involvement of Kane and Mark Henry took a lot from the match, but I disagree. It's actually refreshing to see two truly big men in a match of this type. Not as good as the WM23 MITB match, but still tremendous. (****).

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
The Miz vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Evan Bourne vs. Ted DiBiase vs. John Morrison vs. Edge vs. Mark Henry
Money in the Bank, July 18, 2010

-This is the third and final ""Money in the Bank"" match on the set, not as fast-paced as the previous ones, but it is still, as the Miz would say, ""awesome"". There were a lot of great ladder moments, including Mark Henry pushing everyone off two ladders; John Morrison sandwiched in the ladder in mid-air and slammed down to the canvas; and Evan Bourne using Mark Henry to climb up the ladder, only to press slammed by Orton and Edge onto Mark Henry outside. There's a terrific moment where five guys are climbing up the ladders, all positioned differently, to grab the briefcase and they all take a sick bump, especially Ted DiBiase. But alas, the match belonged to the Miz, who, after the match, breaks down the tears and declares that he made it. The Miz would go on to win the WWE title later that year, justifying his claims. (****)

#1 Contender's Ladder Match for the WWE Championship:
John Morrison vs. Sheamus
TLC, December 19, 2010

-Speaking of Miz, this match would determine who would face him for the belt. John Morrison and Sheamus wrestled a different kind of ladder match, where Sheamus' brawling aesthetics mesh against Morrison's high-flying, agile style, with Sheamus adding a nice dose of psychology by inflicting damage to Morrison`s leg. These two really have great chemistry and they told a great story here, with Morrison playing the injured underdog against the overpowering Sheamus. Even though Morrison won the match, both men looked like stars. Truly a terrific match and I hope someday that Morrison returns to WWE. (****)

Ladder Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio
Extreme Rules, May 1, 2011

-The final match of the DVD set and a fitting way to conclude this set. In early 2011, Edge was forced to forfeit the World Heavyweight Championship due to a career-ending neck injury. As a result, this match was set up to determine who would take his place as a champion. Much like the previous match, this was less of a spotfest and more of a classic underdog story in which Christian, often considered the shadow of Edge and never a World Champion, had the deal with the rising, more aggressive and successful Del Rio. There's also some good psychology as Del Rio focuses on Christian's arm, the same way Sheamus focused on Morrison's leg. But in the end, with the help of Edge, Christian overcame the odds and finally won the World title. Good for Christian; he deserved it. One of the best ladder matches of all time and a great moment for Christian. (****)

To say that The Ladder Match 2: Crash and Burn was a letdown is an understatement. Granted, there was a lot of terrific matches, especially on the third disc, but there was so much missing and so much that was unneeded.

The match selection is utterly bizarre. Why on Earth would they include the New Blood Rising travesty, but not the influential triangle ladder match at WrestleMania 2000? Why is the Jeff Hardy/RVD title unification match here, but not their superior SummerSlam 2001 match? Why is there only ONE TLC match? How could you overlook the Jeff Hardy/CM Punk ladder match at SummerSlam, but add a mediocre ladder match with Carlito? And where's the MITB ladder match from WM24? And some of the matches they picked didn't even ""feel"" like ladder matches (Candido/Smothers, Mankind/Boss Man, McMahons/Austin).

Also the problem was the time length. The 3 discs in the 1st Ladder Match set clocked in over 170 minutes each, but on this set, only the 3rd disc is over 170 while the 1st disc is 135 and the 2nd just under two hours. That is ridiculous as, on the 1st two discs, they could have at least added one or two matches, particularly the ones unfairly excluded.

Overall, Ladder Match 2 cannot hold a candle to Ladder Match 1. Still, if you can overlook some of the duds and mediocre offerings from the set, you'll find a treasure full of great matches and classics waiting for you to discover. There's a lot of good to go along with the bad, but some of what's good is phenomenal and they definitely help make this set worth a purchase, despite its deficiencies.

4649912,3,B005BYBZDQ,"When the first Ladder Match DVD set came out it showed quite a few good matches but seemed to be lacking a few extra rare matches, the forgotten ladder matches on TV or PPV that WWE seemed to sweep under the rug for whatever reason. With Crash & Burn and hosted by Christian we get the expected PPV show stopping contests but also some rare TV ones that show some of the WWE superstars at their best and some of the most daring moments.

Disc 1

-3/20/94-Wrestlemania X-Ladder Match for the Undisputed Intercontinental Championship Shawn Michaels (Champion) vs. Razor Ramon (Champion): Pretty hard hitting match for back then. The first few minutes of the match have some good wrestling holds but then some brawling occurs on the outside before the ladder is brought into play by Shawn. Lots of uses of the ladder by both men, though Michaels uses it first on Razor, even throwing it at him a couple of times. Shawn also hit a splash on Razor from the top of the ladder in a very nice high spot. Razor takes advantage afterwards by tipping the ladder over causing Shawn to hit throat first on the top rope. Razor the reverses an Irish whip and Shawn crashes into the ladder in the corner. Razor also throws the ladder at Shawn while he's against the ring post, then throws it at Michaels again. Lots more back and forth action, then just when Shawn looked like he'd win, Razor pushed the ladder over and Shawn fell into the ropes and got his foot caught in the ropes. Razor then climbed the ladder and retrieved the two belts to become the undisputed I.C. Champion. 11/10.

-3/1994, Smokey Mountain Wrestling, $2,500 Ladder Match, Tracy Smothers vs. Chris Candido: Rare one with a pre-ECW Smothers and Candido, sadly though there isn't much of note, they do have some good wrestling for the first couple of minutes. The ladder does come into play, Smothers puts Chris' neck into the ladder then slams it into the ring post, later Candido misses a splash off the top of a ladder. Both are fighting at the top, Tracy suplexes Chris off the ladder then grabs the envelope with the money to win. 4/10. However Candido is irate, starts stomping and slams the ladder into Smothers and leaves the ring with the envelope of money.

-1/25/97, NWO Souled Out, Ladder Match for the WCW United States Championship, Syxx (Champion) vs. Eddie Guerrero: From the infamous Souled Out PPV comes this fairly average ladder match. Something just seemed off between these two, its not a bad contest but both of them don't seem gel too well. There are some good high spots by Guerrero and the ladder does get used in a few cool spots. As both men battle for the belt, Eddie hits Syxx with it, it falls to the mat and Eddie picks it up to win the U.S. title. 5/10.

-11/30/98, Raw, Ladder Match for the WWE Hardcore Championship, Mankind (Champion) vs. Big Bossman: Shawn Michaels was on commentary here, Mankind and Bossman make good use of the ladder, Mankind hits a nice diving clothesline off the ladder, then an elbow on Bossman who was sandwiched between the ladder. Bossman takes over, slamming Mankind into the ladder into the corner, then worked on the leg to keep him down. Rock ends up coming down, pushes Mankind off the ladder, then hits the Rock Bottom, Bossman climbs the ladder and grabs the title to win. 5/10.

-2/15/99, Raw, Ladder Match for the WWE Championship, vs. Mankind (Champion): Stone Cold Steve Austin joined the announce team and boy did he provide some funny comments during this match. Both were feeling the effects of the previous match but this was still a great match that started on the outside. Rock worked on Mankind's knee, even slamming it into a steel chair a few times, then slammed the knee with a chair while the knee was sandwiched in a ladder. From here the action goes to the outside and Rock eats an elbow while on the guardrail. The best part is a Rock Bottom Mankind got sending him through the announce table. Big Show ends up coming down and chokeslams Mankind off the ladder and Rock grabs the belt to become the new champion. 10/10. Loved the past match face/off between Austin and Rock.

-6/27/99, King of the Ring, Handicap Ladder Match for Control of the WWE, Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Vince & Shane McMahon: About a month prior Linda McMahon gave her portion of control of WWE to Stone Cold, so this match was for complete control and was more comedy based than anything. Austin dominates both men for the opening minutes, then in the entrance way Steve slams Vince and Shane into the ladders and sends a bunch of them cascading down on both men. Back at ringside Austin hits a nice diving elbow driving Shane through the announce table, the briefcase gets raised when Austin tries to get it, Shane knocks him off the ladder and grabs the case to win. 5/10.

-8/13/00, WCW New Blood Rising, Ladder Match, 3 Count w/Tank Abbott vs. Jung Dragons: There's a gold record and a recording contract above the ring and to win you needed to grab both. Right before this Evan Karagias of 3 Count had suffered an ankle injury (the short ladder match on the Best of Monday Nitro DVD), but he still gave it his all. The spots are pretty good here, starts out with some good wrestling but quickly takes to the air, nice splash by Shannon Moore onto all three Dragons. Dueling springboard clotheslines by Noble and Moore knocking down members of the other teams, big dive by Noble onto three men on the outside, there are many other cool spots that make this quite a good if not spotty contest. 3 Count ends up grabbing both the record and contract. 6/10 for the match, Tank Abbott's involvement should've been left out.

-9/25/00, Raw, Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, The Hardy Boyz (Champions) vs. Edge & Christian: This was the night after their classic Steel Cage match at Unforgiven, so they showed the effects of the match but still put on a great show hitting their usual double team spots. After knocking Jeff off of a ladder, E&C sandwich him in one and Christian hits a splash in the corner, a huge ladder is brought out where Edge spears Jeff who was hanging off of the cables (much like their spot a few months later at Wrestlemania X-7). Lita interferes and gets a reverse DDT from Christian, Edge hits a diving clothesline on the outside to Jeff, more intense moves follow and it ends when Lita tips two ladders over and Matt climbs a third one and grabs the titles to win. 8/10.

-7/22/02, Raw, Ladder Match to Unify the WWE Intercontinental & WWE European Championships, RVD (I.C. Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy (European Champion): This was right after Eric Bischoff had become the GM of Raw and he was making his mark by getting rid of some dead weight and titles he didn't want (i.e. the European title), hence this match that would merge the two titles. Both men had faced off in classics before this so they knew each other well and were able to counter the others moves on a few occasions. The ladder is brought out, Jeff is pulled off landing back first, both guys get a ladder and have duel that ends with a spin kick by RVD into Jeff. There's the expected high spots, Swanton, Rolling Thunder and splashes on the ladders, RVD kicks a ladder out from under Jeff turning him inside out, then hits the frog splash, climbs the ladder and wins the I.C. title. 7/10.

(Available on History of the Intercontinental Championship)

-5/18/03, Judgement Day, Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, Team Angle (Champions) vs. Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri: Chavo was injured prior to this contest so Tajiri teamed with Eddie and did quite well meshing with Eddie, Shelton and Charlie double teamed Tajiri then Eddie in the opening minutes. Tajiri does hit a nice handspring elbow knocking Shelton and Haas off the ladder, Eddie does a rolling senton slamming Charlie between two ladders. Haas and Shelton do their patented dive as Shelton rams Tajiri onto a ladder, Shelton gets the mist from Tajiri and he and Eddie grab the titles to become the new champs. 7/10.

-9/29/03, Raw, Ladder Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, Christian (Champion) vs. RVD: Christian had used some dirty tactics to hold onto his title in the recent months but in this match he would have to fight and scratch to retain his title. RVD hits a nice rolling senton onto a ladder slamming it into Christian, he then hits his rolling spin kick knocking Christian off a ladder. However Christian does get some good shots in slamming the hardware into RVD a few times, both men try to go for the belt a few times with the expected spills occuring. RVD ends up hitting the frog splash from the very top of the ladder then climbs to get the belt to become the new I.C. champion. 8/10.

(Available on RVD: One of a Kind)

-12/23/06, OVW, Ladder Match for the Undisputed OVW Women's Championship, Katie  Lea (Champion) vs. Beth Phoenix: Very rare one here, with two women competiting in one of the most dangerous type of matches in wrestling history. Katie starts out with a dive off the ladder to shock Beth, they both try to get the ladder into the ring, Lea dropkicks Phoenix off the ladder. Beth slams Katie onto the ladder then misses a splash from the top, more good hard hitting spots follow, including a neckbreaker by Lea off the ladder. Katie pushes Beth off of the ladder to the ring floor, then she grabs the titles to become the champion. 7/10.

-4/1/07, Wrestlemania 23, Money In The Bank Ladder Match, Jeff Hardy vs. Finlay vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Matt Hardy vs. King Booker vs. Randy Orton vs. CM Punk vs. Edge: This was the usual spot fest though Finlay hit a nice splash from the top rope onto the outside. Matt and Jeff do team up despite this being every man for themselves, but they do take it to each other at the top of a ladder. Jeff hits a huge splash off of a ladder onto the outside slamming Edge through another ladder. Orton hits a massive RKO off the ladder on Punk then Booker hits a Book End on Orton soon after. Hornswoggle makes an appearance but gets knocked off the ladder by Kennedy and shortly after Kennedy hits Punk with a ladder and climbs up to get the briefcase, Kennedy wins. 8/10.

-6/3/07, One Night Stand, Ladder Match for the World Tag Team Championship, The Hardy's (Champions) vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team: Great, great forgotten ladder match, there's tons of hard falls by all four men. Hass takes a couple of spills that really seem to hurt him, good poetry in motion that sandwiches Haas and Benjamin in ladders. Nice spot where Shelton got sent over the top onto a ladder, then later the Greatest hit their trademark hotshot/leap by Shelton as he jumps off a ladder in the ring and drives Matt into a ladder onto the outside. Near the end Shelton gets thrown off a ladder and lands on a ladder on the outside, then the Hardy's grab the titles to retain. 10/10.

-12/10/07, Raw, Ladder Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, vs. Carlito: Forgotten ladder match here and not sure why as its not an all time classic but good for a TV match. Carlito did well in his first ladder match in WWE, he grounded Jeff and made good use of the hardware, however he does take a hard fall onto a ladder set up against a barricade. There are some good bumps to follow, like a sunset flip into a powerbomb off the ladder by Carlito, however there is a botch as Jeff totally misses a Swanton. At the end Hardy does push Carlito off the ladder and grabs the title to win. 8/10.

Disc 2

-6/1/08, One Night Stand, TLC Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, If Undertaker Loses He Is Fired, Undertaker vs. Edge (Champion): Despite there being very little time to build-up this contest, (less than 3 weeks I believe) they delievered big time. Edge was a master at these type of matches and used the weaponary to his advantage to keep down the deadman, oh and there was interference from Hawkins, Ryder, Chavo and others to help Edge win. However Taker does also have a good showing using his strength and hitting some big moves, but the highlight is Taker falling from a ladder smashing through 4 tables on the outside. Edge then climbs up and grabs the title to win and Taker is gone from WWE. 9/10.

-10/5/08, No Mercy, Ladder Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, vs. Shawn Michaels: These two had a big rivalry throughout the summer and fall of '08 and this was the climax in the match of matches. Its a great ladder match, though not as spotty as others in the past, but when it was used they made it count, like Michaels getting pushed off the ladder into the ropes, Jericho slamming the ladder into Shawn's ribs. It was just a good hard hitting match, that saw both take falls from the ladder, the best being Shawn and Jericho crashing through the announce table from about 8 feet off a ladder. Lance Cade interferes preventing Shawn from getting the title, Jericho and Michaels battle at the top with Jericho hitting a headbutt, Michaels falls and Chris grabs the title to win. 10/10.

-4/5/09, Wrestlemania 25, Money In The Bank Ladder Match, CM Punk vs. Mark Henry vs. MVP vs. Finlay vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Christian vs. Kane: Good opener here with the usual spots, expecte double teaming and of course Shelton shines hitting a couple of good high spots, including a helo dive off a ladder onto a bunch of guys on the outside. Kane and Henry also have a good showing as they use their strength to overpower the other superstars and there was an obvious comedic spot where Hornswoggle hit the Tadpole splash onto everyone on the outside. As Kane & Punk are battling at the top, Punk kicks Kane off the ladder and grabs the briefcase to win his second straight MITB match. 9/10.

-7/18/10, Money In The Bank, Raw Money In The Bank Ladder Match, The Miz vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Evan Bourne vs. Ted DiBiase vs. John Morrison vs. Edge vs. Mark Henry: The usual multi-man cluster bomb match is a good one full of the expected high spots, Henry uses his strength to push two ladders over knocking a few men to the ground, Bourne hits some unique and great kicks, Morrison also does well and honestly the pace doesn't really slow down once. Miz does end up taking this one grabbing the briefcase and he looks pretty emotional over winning. 8/10.

-12/19/10, TLC, Number One Contender's Ladder Match, Sheamus vs. John Morrison: Show stealing match here, Sheamus uses his power and also makes good use of the ladder being that this was is first ladder match. Morrison was the real star here as he broke out in this match as no matter how badly he was beat down he wouldn't quit. There were tons of close calls, the ladder usage was well timed and Morrison ends up springing off the ropes and hitting a huge running kick, then climbs the ladder and grabs the contract to become the number one contender. 10/10.

-5/1/11, Extreme Rules, Ladder Match for the vacant World Title: Alberto Del Rio vs. Christian: Its Del Rio's destiny vs. The Instant Classic's quest for his first world title (if you ignore his 2 title reigns during his 3 year run with TNA that is). This was a good ladder match that had plenty of uses of the ladders, but first there is some good wrestling by both Del Rio and Christian. Del Rio gets hotshotted into the the ladder in the corner that looked like it jacked up his elbow. Del Rio gets backdropped into the ring smashing his back into a ladder. Nice jumping kick by Del Rio around a ladder kicking Christian who falls down on the ladder jamming his side. Christian hits a spear and goes up the ladder but Del Rio pulls his legs through and traps Christian in the ladder. Del Rio jumps from the top rope and hits the ladder on the outside as Christian moves out of the way. Brodius Clay makes his way out to prevent Christian from getting the title, Clay gets knocked to the outside but Del Rio locks on the cross arm breaker while Christians arm in a ladder. Del Rio almost has the title when Edge comes out in a jeep distracting him, Christian knocks Del Rio to the outside, and grabs the title to become the new World Champion. 9/10. Christian and Edge celebrate the win in the ring.

Blu-Ray Exclusive Extras

-6/7/09, Extreme Rules, World Heavyweight Championship Match, Edge (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy: Great one here, both take some heavy risks and makes good uses of the ladders around the ring, Jeff gets smahed groin first on a ladder that gets all twisted, Edge misses the spear going head first into the ladder. Nice spot where Edge slaps on a sharpshooter while Jeff was trapped in the ladder. The best spot was when both men fell from a ladder through another ladder set up between the ring apron and the barricade. The finish comes when Jeff pulls Edge's legs in the ladder to trap him and Jeff climbs to get the title. 9/10.

(Available on History of the World Heavyweight Championship)

-12/13/09, TLC, ECW Championship Match, Christian (Champion) vs. Shelton Benjamin: Good opener here as both men really do give a good show, Shelton hits his usual high spots that wow the fans, Christian does ground the high flying Benjamin and also takes to the air at times. Look out for the spot where Christian hits a frog splash off the top rope smashing Shelton through a ladder laid out on the outside. Christian does go up the ladder and grabs the title to retain. 9/10.

(Available on Best PPV Matches of 2009-2010)

-11/29/10, Raw, WWE Championship Match, The Miz (Champion) vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler: For Lawler's birthday he receives his first ever WWE Title match and he does pretty well against the younger Miz. Lawler uses veteran tactics and wears down Miz, while Miz just tries beating down the older challenger. Near the end Lawler sends Miz through a table and goes up the ladder, but Michael Cole of all people grabs Jerry's leg to allow Miz to climb and get the belt to retain. 7/10.

-12/19/10, TLC WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, Dolph Ziggler (Champion) w/Vickie Guerrero vs. Jack Swagger vs. Kofi Kingston: Not a bad opening contest here, the pace stays fast, the unique styles of each guy really gel well together. Swagger seemed to suffer and injury to his wrist when Kofi throws a ladder at him, Dolph also makes good use of the ladders while Kofi does some great moves involving ladders. Great funny moment where Vickie climbs the ladder but Kofi lifts it and frightens her. The closing minutes are great where each guy prevents the other from getting the belt, Swagger and Kingston are up top, the belt falls to the ground and Ziggler grabs it and is declared the winner. 6/10.

For being the second Ladder Match compliation this is good, there are some rare ones and the usual PPV repeats though besides the Wrestlemania Money In the Bank contests and the Shawn/Razor Wrestlemania X match its a well rounded, with some average ones and good set worth having in your wrestling DVD collection. The Blu-Ray extras do make it worth shelling out the extra bucks for in my opinion.",1335830400,,19307,4.597617664148751
4649913,5,B005BYBZDQ,"Every payday I head over to my local K-Mart and broswe the WWE dvds, hoping to add to my collection. I had recently purchased the first ladder match dvd and enjoyed it quite a bit so when I saw that Ladder Match 2: Crash and Burn was in stock, I picked it up. In all honesty, this set surpasses the first in every way imaginable. Sure, some of the matches are ""lesser"" ladder matches (I personally didn't like the Syxx/Eddie Guerrero match from Souled Out 97') but the misses are few and far between. Some of the highlights of this set are:

Handicap Ladder Match for Control of WWE:
Vince & Shane McMahon vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (KOTR 1999) -  Not your typical ladder, as Austin basically beats the hell out of both McMahon's for the majority of the match. The spot where Austin topples the set of ladders near the entrance way is a highlight

TLC Match for the World Heavyweight Championship:
Edge vs. Undertaker (One Night Stand 2008) - Taker's career was on the line in this match and both he and Edge brought their A game to this match. Edge takes some vicious bumps in this match (getting chokeslammed onto a ladder, powerbombed through two tables ) but also dishes a lot of punishment out (he nails some vicious looking chair shots to Taker's skull.) The closing spot was, to me, one of the more impressive bumps Taker has taken in his career

Ladder Match for the World Heavyweight Championship:
Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels (No Mercy 2008) - Two of the best ever to step foot in the ring put on a hell of a show in this match. HBK & Jericho are two of my all-time favorites and they had amazing chemistry together. Both men take a hell of a lot of abuse in this match (particularly Shawn bulldoging Jericho off a ladder through the announce table). Just a great match and, in my opinion, a classic ladder match.

Of course, all three MITB matches are great, as is Christian winning his first world title (the WWECW title doesn't count). As I said before, only a few of the matches are duds but overall, this is a great set and well worth the price. Also, if you've seen the first ladder match dvd, you know how much Todd Grisham sucked as the host. Captain Charisma does a MUCH better job.

Overall -  5/5. Defineitely pick this up and add it to your collection!",1332460800,,2279,4.424821002386635
