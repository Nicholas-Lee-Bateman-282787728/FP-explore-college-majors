The video was well done, but it might have come off better if there'd been a little more performance. Nine on a scale of ten.  Bill Cox",1429833600,,287,4.314814814814815
8604545,5,B00EE6IB8O,"James Morrison is an incredible musician and it was rewarding to learn something about this Aussie and his background. If I had a criticism of this video it would be that I wished they had show more of his playing. After all, he is one of the best musicians in the world. However, I was too delighted to learn more about this world-class talent to complain.",1405036800,,357,4.424242424242424
