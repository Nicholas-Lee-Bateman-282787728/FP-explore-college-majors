8492547,4,B0064EGO6U,"In the 1984 vote, the Democratic presidential nominee lost 49 states for the second time in four elections.  Factor in the 44-state drubbing the party took in 1980, and the consensus among many 30 years ago was that liberalism was in decline.  In this episode of ""Firing Line"" from late 1984, Christopher Hitchens and R. Emmett Tyrrell join host William F. Buckley to discuss the state of liberalism.

The interlocutors end up spending the hour reviewing what liberalism accomplished in the Sixties and Seventies rather than looking at its condition in the mid-Eighties, and there was much agreement on that score.  Buckley and Hitchens turned in strong performances, while Tyrrell had something of an off-day here--he has debated much more ably in other settings.  Viewers who are familiar with the panelists will be struck by how young they all look here.

The Democrats did eventually retool and reorient their party in response to the losses to Reagan, and this episode is a good snapshot in time of the mid-Eighties and a reminder of how ideologies go through ups and downs over the course of the decades.",1443830400,,1110,4.940860215053763

Hitchens really stars with style points though some of the positions he advances are not slam dunks.  Tyrrell, who's book is the ostensibly the subject of the show, poisons the audience against him by sounding petty, personal, and small.  That should not be taken as a condemnation of the quality of all his thought, however.

Hitchen's quickly becomes the focus of the conversation. Tyrrell fades to something of a heckler.

Among Hitchen's early points, he overstretches to say that father of the Great Society, LBJ, was not a liberal.  He is not wholly persuasive.  He's trying to maintain the purity of the left from ""taint of Vietnam"".

As the topic moves to the McGovern/Nixon race of 1972, he attempts to say that the lying to the public practiced by the Nixon Administration had actually been made necessary by the Vietnam War.

Buckley reminded him that lying by the government regarding Vietnam began with the Gulf of Tonkin, which did not involve Republicans in a leadership role.

The debate moves to feminism which Hitchens promotes as one of three great liberal successes of the age (civil rights for blacks and opposition to the war in Vietnam being the others).

Tyrrell and Buckley point out the disintegration of families and neglect of children of the same period and link them.  Hitchens replies that the same thing happened in Britain after WWII, and after women enjoyed a period of extra freedom, child care and family unity were restored.  It was not a smashingly successful debate point.

Tyrrell opens another point. He beleives that integration of women into the broad world beyond the home is evolutionary. He does not oppose it.

Tyrrell further states that Hitchens and the left seem to believe that women were puposefully repressed by men.  It's the question of guilt - who is responsible for how much.  Hitchens says that is not what he means, but he does not address this point squarely.  It lingers on today, I think because it is a terrific political tool.

Hitchens despises American involvement in Vietnam, something to be expected from a self-described socialist.

Despite his wonderful verbal skills, marvelous brain, and obvious fascination with history, he does not argue convincingly that US involvement was wrong. He does not argue that communism could have been good for So Vietnam.  He does not argue that Ho Chi Mihn was a 'people's hero' entitled to rule So Vietnam.  He does not argue that there were no important global geopolitical implications.  The best he can do is that ""Vietnam was lost at Dien Bien Phu in 1954"" and that all further effort was futile.

This highly contestable position was already dogma by 1974, when I heard for the first time as a student in a high school social studies class.  Strong cases have been made against this postion continuously up to the present time.

Buckley offers polite, thoughful rebuttals to both Hitchens and Tyrell through the discussion.  It is Hitchens views that are showcased, not Buckley's, and even less so Tyrrell's.",1404691200,,3154,4.967557251908397
8492549,5,B0064EGO6U,"Hitchens comes prepared having carefully read Tyrell's book, and presents a logical analysis of it, while Tyrell fumbles around lashing out with ad hominem attacks. I detect that even Buckley is unimpressed with his conservative guest and is put in the awkward situation of having to remain silent while Hitchens skillfully dismantles any credibility Tyrell supposedly has as qualified thinker/author on any historical/sociological/economic/political etc. topic. While Buckley can't bring himself to come out and agree with Hitchens most likely due to their radically different political/economic stances, he also seems to acknowledge, with his silence and body language during several exchanges and with a few as he puts them ""hit and run remarks"" that his conservative guest is less than intellectually impressive and an extremely unskilled debater and historian. I have many times disagreed with conservative guests on firing line just as I have liberals, however regardless of political orientation, Tyrell proved himself to be one of the most shallow and incredibly I dare say stupid (he truly deserves the title) guests I've seen on firing line.",1396742400,2,1151,5.545454545454546
8492550,5,B0064EGO6U,"In my search for more of Christopher Hitchens, I came upon this gem. I'm glad I found this. The exchanges between Hitchens and Buckley were sharp and intelligent.",1353369600,,162,4.821428571428571
8492551,5,B0064EGO6U,"If you want to see how many conservatives a liberal can handle at one time, enjoy this precious look at an engaged (late)Christopher Hitchens vs William F. Buckley and R. Emmett Tyrell, Jr, a rising, whiny, conservative fresh from the Arlington think tanks. And Mr. Hitchens does very well, indeed. Although this discussion asked whether there was a liberal crack-up, the conservative side never achieves overwhelming agreement. Hitchens exhibits both the velvet glove and the iron fist here when he fends off both conservative adversaries quite often at the same time. Mr. Hitchens, long a Vanity Fair essayist, displays his quick brilliance easily. As a verbalist, I would say that Mr. Hitchens ranks alongside Anthony Burroughs of ""A Clockwork Orange"" fame in word variety. Even Buckley holds back in awe as Hitchens deals out more than he took in. At one point, when Mr. Tyrell felt he was being cruel in his attack, Christopher repeats himself twice before Mr. Tyrell knew he was grievously wounded while grinning. This has to be one of the most enjoyable discussions that never quite got there for consensus to date. Usually with two disagreeing guests Buckley would graciously watch the fireworks, here he attempts to inflame the fire while a cool Hitchens keeps the embers low. I had read of Hitchens' expansive research and memory. Here you will see it in its short-lived glory.

Mr. Hitchens died in 2011, I believe. You will miss him dearly when you see his active mind at work here.

R. Emmett Tyrell, Jr., however, comes off as a smarmy, shallow Rove-like provocateur enjoying the mismatch.",1330300800,7,1603,5.0
