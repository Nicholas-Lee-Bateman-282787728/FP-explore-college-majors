7915926,1,B00002NDSU,"It seems as if it came out of the late 50's early 60's French existentialist movement; discordant (annoying) musical sounds, repeated to emphasize one-knows-not: short movements within scenes repeated quickly to no positive addition to the viewer: It is hard to explain how bad it is other than to say it is hard to watch and not at all entertaining (unless perhaps you are a very depressed person).

God wants to make love to a woman, based on an ancient myth regarding Zeus. That plot and some full frontal nudity sounds like the movie couldn't be that bad.  It is.  The background scenery is nice.  The rest is fractured editing of fractured shots of actors struggling with bad dialogue.  It is all so very dated and not worth watching; not all things retro are good.",1283126400,,770,4.674074074074074
7915927,2,B00002NDSU,"""H&eacute;las pour moi"" est un mauvais film, Godard lui-mme le reconnat. Mais enfin, comment le critiquer, avoir les mots face &agrave; lui et face aux autres, qui &eacute;jaculent &agrave; son simple nom. Peut-tre juste une image,  une voix et une posture. Celle du Dieu godardien, qui rappelle les faux  dieux du film et de la s&eacute;rie ""Stargate"": cette mme faon de  parler, d'avoir un cancer de la gorge. Alors que dire, comment tre  constructif: comparer, encore et toujours, se dire surtout que Godard n'a  pas fait que des bons films, qu'il a mme fait quelques navets -sans doute  une foi d&eacute;clinante dans le cin&eacute;ma, quand le sujet est moins bon.  Conclusion: un des meilleurs critiques franais, Louis Skorecki, a &eacute;crit &agrave;  propos de ""Je vous salue Marie"", que la vierge de Godard n'&eacute;tait  pas assez vierge, pas assez juive. C'est exactement la situation du Dieu de  ""H&eacute;las pour moi"": pas assez juif et trop allemand.",961718400,3,967,5.180645161290323
7915928,5,B00002NDSU,"Answer: Nobody can tell and nobody gives a damn. Images and sounds of ""Helas pour moi"" didn't receive a warm audience in mexican cinemas but rather giggles and misunderstanding. But, is there something  really to understand about Godard's film? The plot is an excuse to explore  the director's familiar manias about the nature of movies. Always, as in  ""Pierrot le fou"", we are not in front of the conventional film,  but in front of some kind of puzzle that the viewer must solve in his own.  Cinema isn't the social event that it appears to be when confronted with a  personal silence, with an interrogation. What did it mean? Warm and  graceful. Godard's film is an entertaining intellectual offering that  doesn't insist on being understood (as with ready to take classics like  ""Barton Fink"", ""Reservoir Dogs"" and recent David Lynch  failures) but on, simply, being watched. Cinema is a dead word. That is why  Godard said to think in terms of sounds and images. The result: an  interrogation, but in a quiet, inspired manner. It's a pleasure to watch a  film that isn't uncomfortable on being simply... a film.",949968000,5,1116,4.841269841269841
