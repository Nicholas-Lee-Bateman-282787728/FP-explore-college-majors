1644195,1,B00005Q4DD,"How to see Europa as a unwashed hippy, stay in dives, and meet the more smelly volks. All with a bit of anti- Americanism, from our most admired PRAVDA traval writer.
Also this should be titled ""Rick Steves, watch ME travel, a boring home traval vidieo""!",1067644800,2,254,4.543478260869565
1644196,5,B00005Q4DD,"I have been to Europe following the advice of Rick Steves, and it was an awesome trip. If I had seen this DVD after I went, I would have had to go back! He really hits the best sights and cultural attractions, and the tips he gives on budget travel make European excursions affordable to many more than otherwise would be able to go. That alone makes the DVD worth every penny because you will save much more. Buy it to make your trip fantastic and memorable. The DVD is well done and you will want to watch it again and again just for fun. A trip anywhere should be intellectually stimulating and interesting as well as filled with beautiful people and sights--Rick Steve's makes sure it is.",1019952000,18,692,4.4140625
1644197,4,B00005Q4DD,"I've watched Rick Steves over the years and finally decided to buy his 6-pack of European DVD's.  These are pretty much all of the main countries in Europe and a few in Central Europe (Greece, Egypt).
For those of us who love to travel, using Rick Steves' as a personal guide is a great way to see the European Continent.  He
does a great job in telling the watcher not only about places to see, but how to ""travel"" when you're a guest in a foreign country, how to change money, how to find the ""off-the-beaten path"" places away from the tourist crowd, nice family type restaurants...but he never seems to overdo anything.  Perfect balance.  Some other videos I've seen will sometimes spend way too much time on how they make cheese in Switzerland.....who really cares that much about cheese!
Ricks big thing seems to be getting into the local ways and culture, talking with locals, and I must say that I totally agree with his views here.  There is no better trip than when you meet some locals and spend time with them.  The experience will not be soon forgotten.
What I enjoy most is his personal touch when he explains what to look for when seeking food, a room for the night and just some local fun.  Basically, this travelogue is from his perspective with very much the personal touch as he talks into the camera right at you when explaining some of the how's, why's, do's and dont's.  On one DVD, he sits down and explains how he packs and shows what he puts in his money belt that he wears, ie important documents for safety's keep such as passport, travelers checks etc.  He does a lot of walking/hiking during his trips and explains about packing lightly and being able to carry everything in a backpack of sorts.  Don't worry, it's not ""roughing it"" at all.
If there is one thing I might do differently on my trips to Europe that Rick does in his DVD's, would be to stay at a bit higher rated hotel.  He seems to really low budget on the overnight accomodations.
All said and done, I truly enjoyed this set and having been to Europe many times, I can certainly appreciate the time he takes to explain things, tell a bit of history of some sights,  talk to the locals even though he doesn;t really speak any of the languages and is just a real normal kind of guy who is not perfect.  His style of travel is not for the elite types, but rather those of us who are genuinely interested in the culture of where you're at.",1007942400,29,2428,4.4049217002237135
7949649,5,B00005Q4DD,I am completely charmed by this vintage Rick Steves video! His family traveling with him is completely adorable and useful to see traveling with kids is possible!,1441065600,,162,5.037037037037037
7949650,5,B00005Q4DD,Good. As expected.,1438646400,,18,5.333333333333333
7949651,1,B00005Q4DD,"I was really interested to see the Germany & Austrian sections, but the DVD was from his very earlier shows.  It focused too much on Steves and not on the locations.  The information was dated.",1430697600,,193,4.485714285714286
7949652,5,B00005Q4DD,"I have watched this DVD and throughly enjoyed traveling vicariously.  I have been to these countries, traveling independently, over 26 times.  Rick gives some good advice---and for a first time traveler you may change a few of his suggestions.  But it is fun to go on your own.",1408320000,,277,4.729166666666667
7949653,4,B00005Q4DD,This was very helpful as we planned our trip to Germany!,1406678400,,56,4.181818181818182
7949654,5,B00005Q4DD,"What a wonderful way to see Europe!!!  I know that this tape will really help potential travelers, but it is also so enjoyable for those of us who will never travel to see the magnificent sites.",1404950400,,194,4.388888888888889
7949655,5,B00005Q4DD,Firstly the DVD is in great shape and the case is in very good shape.  The DVD by Steves is very informative and easy to watch it makes you feel like you are there right now and walking around with him.  His suggestions are very practical and he covers as much as he can without sounding like he is preaching.  I will be heading to Germany this year and by then I home to have his DVD down pat in far as places to see and how to get there.,1395187200,,439,3.8555555555555556
7949656,1,B00005Q4DD,I bought this item to watch on vacation with my family before my daughter leaves for an exchange in Germany. When we opened the DVD it was to discover a dvd on Spain and Portugal. 3 weeks after purchase it was too late to return the item. What a rip off.,1377561600,,254,4.0
7949657,4,B00005Q4DD,"With my wife coming from a Swiss family, I thought it would be fun to purchase this DVD so the kids could get a feel for the region.  This DVD is well produced, provides lots of great information, and isn't half as boring as others I've seen.

If you're planning to travel to this region, or any other region covered by this series, this is a great little investment to get the most out of your trip.",1243382400,,400,4.181818181818182
7949658,5,B00005Q4DD,"OK, so it was 1990, and lugging a film camera around these three countries, and others, was enough.

But, this is a great video to find out the sights to see, the times to see them, how to not be touristy, and how to do this on the cheap (and NOT while being ""a hippie,"" contrary to any other impressions of Rick Steves).

Plus, his simple, down-to-earth style, while boring to some, is easy to follow for others, as Steves tries to ensure his viewers have a goof-proof vacation.

Again, another sensical Rick Steves combo, putting episodes about all the German-speaking countries into one package.

The sidebars in this video will give you a slice of social life from these different countries.",1136246400,4,695,4.672131147540983
