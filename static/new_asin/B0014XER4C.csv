3135905,3,B0014XER4C,Tonya has a really soothing voice but her video is a bit hard to follow if you're a beginning stepper. She does not go into details on how to perfect the moves. It took me about 3 tries to get the routine down. There is a meditation section and weights.,1273190400,4,253,4.08
3135906,3,B0014XER4C,I was very excited to get this product but when I attempted to use it I found it a bit difficult to do.,1243382400,2,103,3.5217391304347827
3135907,5,B0014XER4C,"I like the step dvd, I thought it was fun and a great workout without using too many dance moves.  The only downside to me is that I think its too short of the step.",1235520000,,165,3.7142857142857144
3135908,5,B0014XER4C,"I found yet another great workout through Amazon.  I really enjoy this one and if I'm going to be totally honest, I lost a lot of my fitness levels lately and needed something just like this to get me back in top notch again.  While I don't need to lose much weight, I need to get my fitness back at the top and this has helped me progress because it's fun to do and the step portion is about 20 minutes so it always seemed doable.
It uses basic choreography so you shouldn't find it hard to keep up and Tonya is a great cuer and motivational.  The weight section is about 22 minutes, so when you put both portions together, you get a great 55 minutes (including warm up and stretches).
The toning segment is also easy to follow and the perfect amount of time.  All you need are weights and your step and that's it.  If there is one thing I don't like about the dvd is the pre-program Bible meditations, but you can obviously skip that and get straight to the fantastic workout.  I love it and highly recommend it.",1211155200,26,1014,4.227979274611399
3135909,5,B0014XER4C,"Tonya Larson's Step Pump DVD is truly innovative.  I liked seeing new moves that I haven't seen before, while keeping ""the core"" in mind.  As I licensed physical therapist I appreciate the care she took to make this workout both safe & effective.  With 3 intensity levels I feel comfortable recommending these workouts to a wider range of people.  The instructions were great even during more challenging choreography moves.
  As a mother of 3 boys under five years of age I need a solid workout worthy of the limited time I have for myself.  Tonya Larson's manner is both warm and encouraging. I thoroughly enjoyed her spiritual warm-ups and obvious sincere faith.  What a refreshing workout!

3135921,5,B0014XER4C,"This workout is very challenging for me but I like it. I'm having to slow it down and study, then practice the moves to be able to do it. I have easier DVD's that I use but I wanted to try something a little harder and this is. She does not show the moves in a slower version and there isn't a teaching component. It is a fun workout with a good beat! Not for beginners though.",1343088000,,377,3.909090909090909
3135922,5,B0014XER4C,"I love this workout!  I think it's most well-suited for folks who have some stepping experience and have already mastered the basic moves (it's not an introduction to step), and who either are getting back into shape or don't want an hour-long step class. For the step portion, there are four short routines she teaches and then you run through them three times. Her cueing is excellent, the moves are all safe, the routines are easy to follow, and her choices are excellent in terms of getting in a good workout in a shorter amount of time. If you're more advanced it would be easy to add propulsion to a lot of the moves for a more intense experience. The pump and ab work is very simple - and can be more intense by adding weight - but again is well-constructed in terms of targeting important muscles. Short segments so, again, goes quickly.

Overall, the step and pump moves are well-chosen to give you an outstanding, gentle (but still rigorous) workout. She instructs well, keeps the dialogue to cueing (unlike some other instructors who feel the need to talk incessantly making the ""annoyance"" factor quite high), and the music is good. I've never played the spiritual motivation section at the beginning of the video so I can't comment on that. (The rest of the video has no religious or spiritual references.)",1340582400,6,1319,4.705627705627705
3135923,5,B0014XER4C,I bought this workout about a month ago.  The step portion is about 26 minutes.  It is a fun workout with great moves.  I have only done one other step routine and I felt this one is more complicated and interesting.  I like the music too.  The next 20 minutes is pumping.  There is about 5 minutes of ab work and 5 minutes of stretching at the end.  It really gets my heart pumping.  My only gripe is I wanted a longer step workout.,1339027200,,433,4.071428571428571

Unlike Gin Miller (the originator of Step) who performs this task extremely well, I was shocked and appalled to find the instructor on this DVD seriously lacked the ability to appropriately cue and break down the moves.  Although the moves were not that difficult it would have been better if the instructor had taken the time to show the steps in slow motion and then add the step back into the chorography in real time.

8256536,5,B0014XER4C,L gave this DVD as a gift my friend told me it is great i give it five stars.,1414713600,,77,3.1052631578947367
8256537,4,B0014XER4C,"I really like this step DVD, the cardio step routine is a lot of fun! She doesn't teach the moves in a slow manner, but that's what I like because then it won't get boring to do after a while. She does cue pretty well, there were a couple of times she didn't say what was next but no big deal. I like to learn the routine anyway. The combinations are put together well, there were no awkward moves. The cool down was nice as well as the stretch, I felt like they were both sufficient. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because the music was kind of bland and quiet. I will be doing this one often!",1410912000,2,610,4.008196721311475
8256538,5,B0014XER4C,I get a good workout with this video. The steps are interesting but not too hard and she offers good easy alternatives for the first few times when you are just learning the routine.  I also like how I can easily do a 30 minute step workout and then add either a 30 minute or 4 minute strengthening option.  I'll be looking for more Tonya Larson videos.,1406246400,,353,4.253731343283582
