8055031,4,B00080RPPK,"Although the story has been changed slightly and the character of the narrator replaced by a young boy who has a bug-collecting habit passed down onto him from his dead father, the tone of the story is still in tact, and the actor (Roberts Blossom) who plays the man bitten by the Gold-Bug in Poe's original story is excellent to say the least.  While certain plot elements have been changed presumably to appeal to a younger viewer (i.e. the viewer's connection to the bug story via a young boy), the essence, tone and atmosphere of Poe's original story remain in tact.  The suspense is in the right places.  The effects/music are well-placed be they dated.  When I purchased this old VHS off eBay I was pleasantly surprised by what I was expecting to be a terribly budget film version of a classic Poe tale.  Highly recommended.",1113523200,8,830,4.657534246575342
