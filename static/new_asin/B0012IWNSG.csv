3089658,1,B0012IWNSG,This product is a major ripoff not by Amazon but by the distributors of the film. It is advertised as season 13 but it is one episode on one disc 93 minutes long.

3089660,4,B0012IWNSG,"Season 13 is just one 90 minute episode. I suspect lead actor, David Jason, has enough money that he does not want to work as much nowadays. But the episode maintains the series' high standards for plot and performances. My only criticism is the volume of the score. I have noticed that the musical score for British TV dramas is typically too loud and this episode of Inspector Frost commits that sin in spades. You will find yourself reaching for the remote to turn down the volume when the music plays over non-dialog scenes and then turning it up again when the dialog starts. Occasionally, the score overwhelms the dialog. All British TV dramas tend to do this but this episode is as bad as it gets.",1209945600,7,704,4.551181102362205

I immediately was suspicious and thought that the store had split up a boxed set of the 13th season in order to rent out each dvd individually, but it appears that that is not so.  It is only one story.  Which I find very odd, how can this be a season?  Anyone else out there able to shed some light on this?

The amazing part of the film is the tremendous depth of character displayed by Jack Frost.  Frost deals in the very real world of ignorance, greed, and political power mongering with a depth of wisdom which is seldom shown in TV or Movie drama.

3089693,5,B0012IWNSG,"The following applies to all the 15 series of ""A Touch of Frost""
1) Why:  Frost has little violence, and lots of wit.  Subtle humor and along the series it builds up characters with their virtues and their failures.  It has always a humane side to the stories, poor people, sad people, ambitious people, deeply unhappy people.  Kindness and noble lives where you least expect them.  And evil lives where only goodness and success is overtly displayed.  All this kaleidoscope of human existences, trying to survive in a world that they often don't understand.  Even the bad characters  are shown in their human light.
2).Compare with others:  I enjoy English police whodunit's, all of them. Poirot, Marple, Morse, Lewis, Maigret, Foyle.  Most of them share the features I described above.  I've known this series since it was first broadcast in England, where I used to live.

3089694,5,B0012IWNSG,This is a first class crime series that ran for many years in England. I believe from 1998 through 2006.  The story lines are good and the acting is excellent .It aired on channel 2  wgbh public tv mystery series for a few years. Also it is odd to see that they don't carry guns while chasing crime. Can you imagine that in the USA ?,1359244800,,333,4.03030303030303
3089695,5,B0012IWNSG,"Like all the Inspector Frost stories, there is often an undercurrent of sadness which brings a reality to them.  The characters are belivable and the stories complex enough to keep ones attention.  Inspector Frost is not a sexy ""Hollywoodd"" character but a middle-aged man with a drive to find the truth through dogged hard work and a gift of intuition.  He does not suffer fools gladly (including his boss) but is compassionate and understanding to those less fortunate individuals.  I have never seen an Inspector Frost mistery that I didn't enjoy.",1318809600,,550,5.010989010989011

I carefully scanned the sellers' to make sure I wasn't just buying one episode from a series.  I received this through the post today, immediately thinking ""...hmmm, it's a bit small..."" and annoyed after opening it with one title and one disc (was looking forward in watching 1-3 of them at least).  I believed right away someone was pulling a fast one - after browsing them all, and reading these reviews, it sure is just the one episode - bizarre.  I'm yet to watch it, so can't recall what it's about even as it has been over 15 years now!  Incidentally, why was there the only one episode and is series(!) 15 the same?

I was nearly put off the idea by bad reviews, but my husband and I really enjoyed it.  All the fuss about Frost's younger love interest is silly -- she is not that young!  Besides, Frost never has any time for her, just as he has never had any time for any woman, so the issue is pointless.  We do wish there was more than one episode on the DVD, but we were aware of this beforehand, and bought the DVD anyway, with no regrets.  We are hopeless Frost fans!",1279238400,,560,4.091743119266055
3089699,4,B0012IWNSG,"I own all the Frost seasons, but because of reviews on 13, I had not ordered it.  It came on sale, so wanting to keep the series whole, I did purchase it.  I did not find it to be as bad as some of the other reviewers; in fact I did not find it to be bad at all.  Some of the other reviews I read had issues with him and a younger woman.  Well, sometime in life that happens.  David Jason himself had a daughter when he was in his 60's, so I assume his wife had to be a lot younger than he was in real life!  The show does not show him being intimate with this young actress anyway, so I don't understand the criticism.  As for the ""season"", I found it disappointing that it was only one episode.  As for the content, having watched documentaries on Endangered Species, whoever wrote the episode did their homework.  The smuggling of animals happens in just this way, at times.  Although this was not one of my favorite ""Frost"" episodes, I though it fit in with the rest of the show just fine.",1278115200,3,993,4.098445595854923

3089701,1,B0012IWNSG,"I like Frost and I liked the one episode on the DVD well enough--I would give the episode 3  or 4 stars.  However I do not recommend buying this DVD.  The season has at least one other episode, perhaps two--Netflix, Amazon, and IMDB have conflicting information about which episodes belong in which season--and the other episode or episodes are not on the disk.  I have no idea why.  So, while the one episode is good enough, the stinginess of the studio in only release one episode is rather irritating and deserves a pan.

3089704,3,B0012IWNSG,"OK everyone has said it before that there is only one episode and it is a pretty silly episode at that. Trouble is David Jason is always watchable!

The reason for this comment is to clear up a few misunderstandings. This isn't the last of Frost - a new series of 3 episodes is currently showing on UK TV:

Season 14, Episode 1: Mind Games
Original Air Date--12 October 2008
Season 14, Episode 2: Dead End
Original Air Date--19 October 2008
Season 14, Episode 3: In the Public Interest
Original Air Date--26 October 2008

and is being released in the UK on DVD in late October.

What is even stranger is that in the UK there is no season 13 at all! Endangered Species was first of all released on a single DVD but is listed (along with the earlier story ""Near Death Experience"" as season 12. Hence in the UK we have seasons 1-12, an extra disc also labelled series 12 and now series 14 is being released.

I suspect in the US Endangered Species was released as season 13 to avoid a confusing gap (but then they just added to the confusion by having 2 seasons that were effectively single episodes!)",1224460800,10,1098,4.389162561576355
3089705,1,B0012IWNSG,"I've been a follower of Frost since the series first started. I have also read the books and I own all the released DVDs. I was sorry I bought season 13.

Firstly, it's just one episode, and secondly the story was just plain weak by Frost standards. Even ignoring such crass adds such as the car chase and weapons usage, the main problem is that the character behavior was as if the storywriter/director had neither seen previous episodes nor understood the characters (Mullett and Frost working hand-in-hand without acrimony!). In addition, the sub-plot of an advanced relationship between Frost and a young fitness instructor is ridulous and detracts, not adds, to the storyline. If you own the previous series don't bother with this one. If you don't own the previous Seasons, buy them over this, especially Seasons 1-10.",1221436800,7,824,4.971014492753623

There are no more so they can't put another one on this set.
If you love this series, which was one of the greatest cop shows ever to come out of the u.k. then you must see or own this dvd in order to see the last episode.  I did feel that they should have put this last episode on the last boxset but at least we finally have the entire series out on dvd in our region.  They have been out in region 2 for years.  However you can't complain that there is only one episode because there are no more.  And If they make another it would be season 14 on a dvd release.  But it's been a while since they made this series so this is probably the last episode ever.

3324190,5,B0012IWNSG,"The following applies to all the 15 series of ""A Touch of Frost""
1) Why:  Frost has little violence, and lots of wit.  Subtle humor and along the series it builds up characters with their virtues and their failures.  It has always a humane side to the stories, poor people, sad people, ambitious people, deeply unhappy people.  Kindness and noble lives where you least expect them.  And evil lives where only goodness and success is overtly displayed.  All this kaleidoscope of human existences, trying to survive in a world that they often don't understand.  Even the bad characters  are shown in their human light.
2).Compare with others:  I enjoy English police whodunit's, all of them. Poirot, Marple, Morse, Lewis, Maigret, Foyle.  Most of them share the features I described above.  I've known this series since it was first broadcast in England, where I used to live.

3324192,5,B0012IWNSG,"Like all the Inspector Frost stories, there is often an undercurrent of sadness which brings a reality to them.  The characters are belivable and the stories complex enough to keep ones attention.  Inspector Frost is not a sexy ""Hollywoodd"" character but a middle-aged man with a drive to find the truth through dogged hard work and a gift of intuition.  He does not suffer fools gladly (including his boss) but is compassionate and understanding to those less fortunate individuals.

I received this through the post today, immediately thinking ""...hmmm, it's a bit small..."" and annoyed after opening it with one title and one disc (was looking forward in watching 1-3 of them at least).  I believed right away someone was pulling a fast one - after browsing them all, and reading these reviews, it sure is just the one episode - bizarre.  I'm yet to watch it, so can't recall what it's about even as it has been over 15 years now!  Incidentally, why was there the only one episode and is series(!) 15 the same?

Besides, Frost never has any time for her, just as he has never had any time for any woman, so the issue is pointless.  We do wish there was more than one episode on the DVD, but we were aware of this beforehand, and bought the DVD anyway, with no regrets.

I did not find it to be as bad as some of the other reviewers; in fact I did not find it to be bad at all.  Some of the other reviews I read had issues with him and a younger woman.  Well, sometime in life that happens.  David Jason himself had a daughter when he was in his 60's, so I assume his wife had to be a lot younger than he was in real life!  The show does not show him being intimate with this young actress anyway, so I don't understand the criticism.  As for the ""season"", I found it disappointing that it was only one episode.  As for the content, having watched documentaries on Endangered Species, whoever wrote the episode did their homework.  The smuggling of animals happens in just this way, at times.

3324201,3,B0012IWNSG,"OK everyone has said it before that there is only one episode and it is a pretty silly episode at that. Trouble is David Jason is always watchable!

The reason for this comment is to clear up a few misunderstandings. This isn't the last of Frost - a new series of 3 episodes is currently showing on UK TV:

Season 14, Episode 1: Mind Games
Original Air Date--12 October 2008
Season 14, Episode 2: Dead End
Original Air Date--19 October 2008
Season 14, Episode 3: In the Public Interest
Original Air Date--26 October 2008

and is being released in the UK on DVD in late October.

What is even stranger is that in the UK there is no season 13 at all! Endangered Species was first of all released on a single DVD but is listed (along with the earlier story ""Near Death Experience"" as season 12. Hence in the UK we have seasons 1-12, an extra disc also labelled series 12 and now series 14 is being released.

I suspect in the US Endangered Species was released as season 13 to avoid a confusing gap (but then they just added to the confusion by having 2 seasons that were effectively single episodes!)",1224460800,10,1098,4.389162561576355
3324202,1,B0012IWNSG,"I've been a follower of Frost since the series first started. I have also read the books and I own all the released DVDs. I was sorry I bought season 13.

Firstly, it's just one episode, and secondly the story was just plain weak by Frost standards. Even ignoring such crass adds such as the car chase and weapons usage, the main problem is that the character behavior was as if the storywriter/director had neither seen previous episodes nor understood the characters (Mullett and Frost working hand-in-hand without acrimony!). In addition, the sub-plot of an advanced relationship between Frost and a young fitness instructor is ridulous and detracts, not adds, to the storyline. If you own the previous series don't bother with this one. If you don't own the previous Seasons, buy them over this, especially Seasons 1-10.",1221436800,7,824,4.971014492753623

There are no more so they can't put another one on this set.
If you love this series, which was one of the greatest cop shows ever to come out of the u.k. then you must see or own this dvd in order to see the last episode.  I did feel that they should have put this last episode on the last boxset but at least we finally have the entire series out on dvd in our region.  They have been out in region 2 for years.  However you can't complain that there is only one episode because there are no more.  And If they make another it would be season 14 on a dvd release.
