2530816,5,B000ERVJKE,I have watched Numb3ers a few times and I really like how you can use math in your everyday settings. I am not really that good at math but I love to learn. I love murder mysteries and that is what this show is all about.,1143072000,10,221,3.8260869565217392
2530817,5,B000ERVJKE,"My father is a math teacher at the local University, so we all sit down on friday night to enjoy a cop show (my favorite kind) and my father will point out all the improbabilities. He actually knows the consultant for this show, who works at CalTech. The Numb3rs people actually get the math right most of the time. This is one of my all time favorite shows",1142726400,24,357,4.264705882352941
2530818,5,B000ERVJKE,"I like the fact that in the new season they have made some cast changes, especially with adding Navi Rawat to the main cast is great.

Plus this DVD is going to have a Lou Diamond Phillips Commentary making it a Must Buy (this was a really nice thing to do especially considering he only was a guest star)",1142553600,7,305,4.169491525423729
2530819,5,B000ERVJKE,"I don't watch a lot of TV, but I never miss this one. The scenarios are interesting and fun. I enjoy all of the characters, especially Professor Larry Fleinhardt. Unlike another reviewer whom I disagree with, his part is critical to filling out the story each week. Whoever thought of a show using mathematicians to work with the FBI should be applauded. In a time when mathematics is placed well behind sports in our schools it is great to have a show demonstrating to our children how important math is in our world and what practical applications there are in even the most unlikely places. I love the mathematical models and studies presented each week in a way that is understandable to those of us who are not mathematicians. It almost makes me wish that I were a mathematician. What a dreary sounding job, and yet, it really comes to life in this show.",1142208000,24,859,4.584415584415584
2530820,5,B000ERVJKE,"This show is smart, discussing some esoteric mathematical concepts.  However it delivers it in an interesting way with metaphors and visuals, allowing the average person to follow along.  It gives insights of how mathematics applies to various aspects of life, stressing the importance of math towards understanding life.

Despite all the math geekiness Numb3rs, unlike CSI and Law & Order, focuses in on the characters' personalities and relationships.  This allows the viewer to emphathize with the characters' lives, rather than being engrossed solely by the case on hand.

This combination of developing the characters while they delve into a complicated subject is something I haven't seen before.  It separates this show from the rest, and in my humble opinion, it's the best one.",1142121600,8,786,5.349593495934959
2530821,5,B000ERVJKE,"I was hook on this show from the very first episode. I am a math major and love math. I like the fact that this show is different from all the other cop shows. I love CSI, but if I miss an episode I am okay. However, I am in front of my tv every friday night. I have not missed an episode and I was waiting for it to come on DVD. I am thrilled that Numb3rs is finally being released. I can't wait to watch the first season over again. I love the all the characters and the stories are great. I recommned this set for anyone who wants a good show to watch.",1141862400,6,555,3.793103448275862
2530822,5,B000ERVJKE,"In an era of mostly annoying TV, this is a winner. My husband and I watch Numb3rs religiously each Friday night...so we can't wait to be able to watch whenever we want with the DVD release. We love the drama, the characters and the plot. The addition of the mathematical angle to all the cases makes this a interesting and different crime show.  This is a show that shows a different angle to federal cases and really improved nighttime television!",1141689600,6,448,4.6
2530833,5,B000ERVJKE,"There are very few shows that I watch twice. This is one of them. The Scott brothers did an amazing job producing this, and the concept, writing, acting, and math is absolutely perfect.",1510272000,,185,4.636363636363637
2530834,2,B000ERVJKE,The audio on this dvd is terrible. Since there are no subtitles available it is very hard to watch.,1502755200,,99,4.2631578947368425
2530835,4,B000ERVJKE,"I only watched this because of the beautiful and talented Sarah Wayne Callies co-staring in one of the episodes. That episode was good but I just wanted to see her lol Good episode, might check out another.",1497052800,,206,4.594594594594595

2530838,5,B000ERVJKE,"great show, wish they would bring it back",1493510400,,41,4.25
2530839,3,B000ERVJKE,"As a lover of math and science, I really wanted to give this show a 5* and an all positive review - but I just can't. It's great that they were portraying math and science applied to solve crime. But if the premise of the show was to make it as believable as possible, and given that they used Los Angeles as a setting, it is ABSURD the lack of Hispanic and Asian people cast on this show. This is another prime example of whitewashing in mainstream TV and film.

Let's look at the facts and figures:
Los Angeles demographics (2005): Hispanic or Latino 48.89%, White: 28.50%, Asian: 11.14%, Black or African American: 9.88%
FBI Workforce, Special Agents (FY2012): White 83.1%, Hispanic/Latino 7.0%, Black/African American 4.8%, Asian 4.2%
Caltech Undergrad Enrollment (2005): White 51.8%, Asian 31.1%, Hispanic 6.9%, Black/African American 1%

While I have no issue with the lead characters and majority of the FBI staff being white (which is an accurate representation), the producers clearly made an effort to include a black agent as a recurring cast member, and thus accounted for racial distribution. But after watching almost 2 seasons of this show, pretty much ALL of the characters involved in each episode's story line are white with a small fraction being black. Where are all the Latinos and Asians in the general population??? ALL the victims of these crimes are white... really?? The first instance of an Asian person besides a lab tech cameo is in S2E1 where the case involves a Vietnamese gang. Seriously? Why not include Asians in the college campus (both Caltech and UCLA currently have more Asian than White undergrads and a significant portion of the faculty is Asian) or hospital scenes (over 20% of California physicians are Asian)? Why not cast more Hispanic/Latino as members of the police (43% of LAPD officers identify as Hispanic/Latino)?

""Oh, but Amita's character is Indian..."" -> they could not have picked a more whitewashed actress (don't get me wrong, she is gorgeous but also half-German, no offense but how many Indian girls actually look like that?)
""Later on the show they add a half-Asian actress as a recurring cast member..."" -> who could pretty much pass for Caucasian and whose character name is Liz WARNER...

This kind of discrimination is no different from other forms of racism and has to STOP.",1492992000,4,2340,4.931472081218274

2530853,5,B000ERVJKE,"Love, love, love this show, although the first is a little rough. It's very diverse, more than any cop show I've seen. The main characters are Jewish, although this isn't mentioned until later on. Several very strong female characters, including women of color and women who are in positions of power. By the end of the show, there are more women and people of color on the team than white men, and I don't know another show where that happens. It deals with therapy and PTSD in a very matter-of-fact way. And the way they discuss math is easy to understand and makes me wish I was better at math.",1486684800,5,597,4.4363636363636365
2530854,5,B000ERVJKE,"Loved this show when it first came out.  Now I'm watching it again with my son.  I love the interactions between the two brothers and their father.  If I like the characters, then I will watch the show.",1486684800,,202,4.2631578947368425

2530860,4,B000ERVJKE,I've enjoyed watching the series more than once starting when it was aired on TV.  I like the cast and the scripts.  Although I don't always understand the math there are things I have learned from the way Charlie explains how he works at a solution.  I was sorry when the program concluded but it didn't go on too long for viewers to loose attention.,1486425600,,351,4.369230769230769

2531070,4,B000ERVJKE,"Just watched episode 9: sniper zero, the climax scene was good however I wish it would have made more sense. When the sniper takes it's first shot while the aim is on charlie...well you know what i'm trying to say. If the first shot was meant to be the same shot that charlie nearly avoided then how did Don know to tell charlie to get down on the ground and if Don did know something which obviously he didn't since Alimi (the name of the black fbi agent) was standing like a sitting duck talking on his phone xD. It was probably due to Don's surprise of Charlie showing up at the scene that he was yelling at him to get down. Then again, why are any of them out in the open with an active sniper in the area.

2531087,3,B000ERVJKE,"I intend to continue watching it, hoping for better.  For a show that's premise is inherently intellectual... It just doesn't seem that clever.  Even the opening credits narration is a bit simplistic... ""We use numbers every day... To tell time; to handle money"" seems like what a 3rd grader would say about why math is important.  The acting is pretty good; the writing definitely needs improvement.  As always, Amazon Prime Video works flawlessly for me and is yet another GREAT reason to be a Prime member.  Netflix?  Psshh.  Hulu? Forget about it. Amazon for the win!",1478217600,2,571,4.885416666666667

I've become aware of more math theories than I've ever imagined existed and it fascinates me that someone could look at numbers and symbols and be able to read it just as a language, similar to how a musician can look at a sheet of music and hear it in his head.  The fact that Charlie can then explain his theories in an understandable and interesting way makes me wish all my math teachers had had that ability.  Fact is, my brain shuts down when hearing numbers. I was an art major. This show makes me pay attention and think about the applications of math.
The interplay of the characters is very enjoyable and grows as their characters develop over the seasons.  I especially enjoy the humor shared between them and all their quirks.  My husband is a professor, so he can relate to some of that and the college scene.",1474243200,4,886,4.41717791411043

It moves along pretty quickly, and makes you think. And still includes social dynamics, such as those of a family. I like it a lot!",1469404800,,278,4.58
2531677,5,B000ERVJKE,"This is an excellent series. I love the various relationships on the show. The obvious brotherly love & rivalry between the two leads. The team-work and friendships that develop as the series progresses (gets even better starting with season 2). As much as I enjoy the intellectual story lines, the mystery/thriller story lines, all of the characters, Judd Hirsch stands out as my favorite. His character evolves from being the loving father to two vastly different sons to the patriarch of the FBI team.",1469404800,,504,5.011904761904762

2531681,5,B000ERVJKE,Thoroughly entertaining.  But you must excuse my perspective since I've had most of the University Math and Comp Sci Eng courses and recognize many of the scientific references just by name.  This is both a novel and practical approach to use of numbers in everyday life and applied to colorful crime stories.  I'd recommend just for examples of how math and science could be used.  But I'd also recommend for the intriguing stories brought to life by the actors.,1469318400,,463,4.822784810126582

The show has very interesting
And  diverse characters . It shows the complexity of living with a genius from both sides it is a sub plot I'm sure but it's the file that keeps me stuck to it I'm only sorry it is only in re runs that I get to enjoy the show. Where are these writers now. And may I say one more thing. It is also more entertaining not to have minut to minut displays of the ugly violence that is the bases of the show use of math.

It's a great story, but also kind of cool if you grew up in that era & remember all the music and 'budding' technology!!  Makes you wonder how much of it could really be true.  You've got to watch this show and FX will hopefully continue it.  It always seems that some of the best TV falls victim to the crappy reality stuff.  I refuse to watch it.

2532044,4,B000ERVJKE,I liked this show when it first aired and was unhappy when they canceled it. I am looking forward to viewing the rest of the episodes again.,1442448000,,140,4.222222222222222
2532045,5,B000ERVJKE,I don't like math. My kids don't like math. But we do like this show! Its intriguing to see how math relates to things (common or otherwise) that we might not consider. We enjoy the interplay between the family as well. We were disappointed when Sabrina Lloyd was replaced.,1442448000,,273,4.591836734693878
2532052,4,B000ERVJKE,"Since I was one of those kids who thought that studying anything more than basic arithmetic was a waste of my valuable kid time, because I could not imagine actually having a need to use it in real life, stories such as those told in Numb3rs' first season are a reasonably convincing way to illustrate how math is used in unexpected ways to solve common problems.  Pretty well written.  The cast and character relationships are good.  Dr. Larry Fleinhardt is often just priceless.  I can't give this series 5 stars because of Tony Scott's high-pressure techniques, which can be a little annoying if you just want to concentrate on solving the case, and because some of the plots are not quite as believable as I wish they were.  Overall, it's a good watch, and, as is usually the case, season 1 is the best.",1442361600,,807,4.576388888888889

2532055,5,B000ERVJKE,Love this show. I don't even mind the math talk. He makes it more accessible to non math majors. Love the math mixed with FBI aspect,1442102400,,132,4.115384615384615
2532056,5,B000ERVJKE,"This has long been one of my favorite crime shows. They spend little time on the gore, and lots of energy focusing on how mathematics can be used to solve crimes. Talk about making math interesting to the masses! The characters are believable, and they very seldom toss in something that just doesn't fit. (One mistake - Charlie and his father are raking leaves around their house, but somehow they are raking brightly hued sugar maple leaves at a house in Los Angeles. I had a good laugh.) Still, I love this show. It makes me think hard.",1442016000,,539,4.510204081632653

2532148,5,B000ERVJKE,"I watched the show when it was on TV and loved it so I was glad to see it available in DVD. I'm an electronics engineer and math has always interested me. The episodes are built around complicated math formulas, but they do not go into detail that would lose interest of anyone who isn't working on a math degree. They reference a particular formula and give a very brief explanation of how it will help solve the case. My favorite characters are Charlie and Larry, but the difference in characters between them and Don and their father, Allen add to the enjoyment. I also have the book ""Numbers behind NUMB3RS"" that describes in a little more detail the math aspect of solving crimes, including some that were not portrayed in the show.",1438992000,,737,4.548872180451128

From now on I will have a renewed appreciation for ANOVA (analysis of variance) and multiple regression equations, thanks to this show. Kudus to the writers for integrating mathematical analysis into a crime drama, and for bringing this show to life.  The actors are also great in bringing these episodes to life, and from taking an otherwise potentially boring approach to criminal analysis to life in an exciting way!

This is a refreshing angle, and it's especially interesting that actual mathematical, logical, and physics theories and principles are mentioned and briefly explained. I'm sure I don't remember any of them after the show is over, but it's very interesting to hear them referred to and to see the practical applications; this elevates the script quite a bit. The actors are excellent--Judd Hirsch is always fine, and Peter MacNicol in a supporting role as a physics professor is charming and utterly believable. Anyone who has any interest in residential architecture will appreciate the scenes in the Emrick Arts and Crafts style home and the recurring outside setup shot.

There are moments that reveal themselves all over again, or for the first time having missed it the first time around in broadcast.  The first season as with many was an introduction of characters, their many relationships, and the plot grounding of all the characters within the unfolding episodes.  This first season had only 13-eps, introduced mid-season, so it was short but captured our attention with writing that carried on for a total of 6-seasons before being cancelled by CBS.  The show has its detractors, academic and otherwise, when it comes to the purported mathematics behind understanding the hidden patterns of the crimes committed and solution provided as result, but it is after all entertainment, much as are stories of science fiction and fantasy.

2532562,5,B000ERVJKE,"This was one of my ""must watch"" shows when it came on air.  The idea of using math to solve crimes was a new idea and it was great to see a show that was original.  I've enjoyed Rob Morrow's work since Northern Exposure.  David Krumholtz plays Charlie (the math professor) perfectly.  Nice to see Sabrina Lloyd again (after her work on Sliders.)  Judd Hirsch as always does a great job.  Peter MacNicol's character compliments the show nicely with some added humor while keeping to the show theme.",1424390400,,497,4.590909090909091

2532567,5,B000ERVJKE,I can't say my comment is unbiased. I have been a Nunb3rs fan since the first season. It is a great series & I was very unhappy when it was cancelled after the sixth season.

The interaction between the biological family is exactly what you see in real families - support, conflict, agreement and disagreement handled aptly. The interaction in the chosen families - the academic family of the younger son and the FBI family of the older are equally perfectly handled. They act and react just like real families. The cases are wonderful - they aren't just ""shoot 'em up"" cases that are so often depicted on typical cop shows. They require intelligence and skill to solve - and not just the skill of the ""Math Guy"" character - but the combined efforts of the entire group. Very enjoyable.",1416700800,,740,4.834645669291339

Uses the hard sciences to solve crimes, with tweaks here & there, Inevitably missing or faulty information causes - what is thought to be the answer to be ""off"", even wrong.  The implementation of human psychology is riveting, as it is not an exact science; but they show universal behaviors, as well as consistent, even unconscious behaviors of those with criminal intent.  Great for teens or college students studying mathematics, engineering, applied mathematics, criminal sciences, truly, any of the sciences.  It really increases interest in how the world works and why, making it relatable.  Sadly this show did not have the deserving ratings when it was on the air.  Caveat, the information is condensed as well as the time line of resolution, like any show. Problems are not always solved so quickly.

Fun. But I don't find myself feeling compelled to watch one after the other to get a ""fix.""

2532859,5,B000ERVJKE,"It is not only an enjoyable, fun show to watch, but along with its wonderful entertainment qualities comes a educational/informational side that makes the show an all-around hit--from its main characters to its supporting cast.

2532881,5,B000ERVJKE,Awesome Pilot  I cannot wait to watch the rest of them.  It made me think of times when math just jumps up and hit me in the face like the numbers just fell into place.

2532893,5,B000ERVJKE,Numb3rs is one of my all-time favorite shows. it has a great mix of action and thinking via the math employed. Plus the family dynamic with the Epps helped elevate the show even more. The math got a little silly and wonky toward the end of the show but it was solid in Season 1.,1401235200,,278,4.072727272727272

2532895,5,B000ERVJKE,Great positive show. Glad someone suggested it. Interesting concept to perhaps motivate our young math loving teens. I would highly recommend it if you're thing is not nasty reality TV.,1401148800,,185,5.2

2532898,4,B000ERVJKE,"I enjoy the show very much. I am not really sure that it could happen in reality, but it is interesting how they put math behind everything. It is also interesting how they show that you can still be wrong with your predictions if you don't really have all the facts for prediction.",1400025600,,282,4.339622641509434

2532901,5,B000ERVJKE,"This show is a combo of detective work and personal life portrayed by some wonderful actors & actresses.  The addition (no pun intended) of math is extremly interesting.  Though I don't fully understand all the 'numbers'....and how it all works, 'Charlie' is great at explaining and the extent the writers go to show what he's saying by illustrations is amazing....and understandable.  It is actually genius!  It makes the same-o same-o detective show into an excellent and exciting watch.  Judd Hirsch plays the 'dad' and his character and personality add another layer of interest and perspective.",1399852800,,599,5.2631578947368425

2532931,3,B000ERVJKE,"I love mysteries, and I got my money's worth out of the series (I saw it for free on Netflix), so I really shouldn't complain overly.

But I can complain just enough....

Characters early on get completely full of themselves, Mathematician is smug, FBI brother smug (and the government can never be wrong, why would you hide things from them?!?), and the Scientist in the group (living in a sewer, in the desert, makes a trip into outer space, all time spewing supposedly cosmic snippets of knowledge to the other cast members?).

This like other series, I had to take defensive measures to still enjoy.

In this case, every time I heard the term ""game theory"", ""basein (sp?) search"", or drivel spouting from the scientist, I left the room for five minutes, went to talk to the family.

Good news is I think this tactic led to me losing a good 10 pounds over the course of watching the thing.

Plots weren't terrible, interaction of characters was decent, particularly the supporting cast.

Don't regret watching it, and they did have a few decent episodes, still in all, you'd have to tie me to a chair and duct tape my eyes open to get me to sit through them again.

One tip, put up a wire screen in front of your TV, so when they start spewing nonsense and you throw something at the screen in frustration, there's less chance of doing damage to the tube.  (My boy's idea)",1397779200,,1375,4.512096774193548

2532933,5,B000ERVJKE,"And now love it on Amazon Prime instant video.  Some of the story lines are a bit heavy, but after all, it's a cop show. But the real identity of it. is the math.. not to mention the actor who plays Charlie has dreamy bedroom eyes and he's super intelligent to boot but not in a boastful obnoxious manner. I enjoyed this show when it was on tv and I really appreciate being able to see it again using my kindle fire. I highly recommend you give it a chance.",1397779200,,457,4.0777777777777775
2532934,3,B000ERVJKE,"The idea of this show is great, I used to watch it when I was a teenager. But now that I'm a Criminal Justice student, this show is kind of horrifying. The portrayal of the FBI and all of Law Enforcement is so very wrong. Believe it or not, LEO's and the FBI actually have these things called laws that they HAVE to obey. Shows like this make their jobs harder, because everyone believes that the justice system is run like it is on TV. It's not.

Other than that, this show has a great characters and a fun story.",1397692800,,514,4.14

2532937,4,B000ERVJKE,I enjoy a show that has some realism and being married to a police officer that enjoys seeing crimes that are more realistic then adding the math in sucks you right in. It is good tv. We enjoy watching it together and seeing where the show goes. And why not give us something to get science and math an interesting twist.,1397260800,,321,4.278688524590164

2532956,5,B000ERVJKE,"This is a fascinating TV series that explains the mathematical principles which are discussed and applied in each episode.

2532959,5,B000ERVJKE,"I didn't watch Numbers at all until long after the series ended, and only decided to watch it because it was free through Amazon Prime and I had always wondered how the main character Charlie solved crimes using math.  Based on the few commercials I remembered seeing for the show while it was still running, I had the impression that Charlie could just see math and numbers everywhere, kind of like seeing the Matrix.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the show and realized that the mathematics and how it was presented were exactly the same math modeling algorithms and equations that I had learned while getting my degree in mathematics.  That said, I probably get much more enjoyment out of math than most people.  So if do not enjoy math, I doubt you will enjoy this show.

PS:  Just an FYI regarding the series as a whole, the first couple seasons were good, but as I got toward the last few seasons, it seemed to become somewhat repetitive and less focused on the math which was somewhat of a let down.",1392854400,,1027,4.554347826086956
2532960,5,B000ERVJKE,I like the series because the characters are great! The interactions between the brothers are well done. It's great to see them get together as a family at the end of some of the shows. The best part of the show is how the writers bring in the math to every episode. Each is unique.,1392681600,,282,4.1454545454545455
2532961,5,B000ERVJKE,"Its fantastic, a totally new approach to solving crime, i absolutely loved it. I really liked the contrasting characters between the brothers and how they both come in from completely different perspectives on the same problem.",1392681600,,227,5.333333333333333
2532962,4,B000ERVJKE,"Numb3rs is an awesome show with a stellar cast:  Rob Morrow (""Northern Exposure"", ""The Whole Truth""), Judd Hirsch (""Taxi"", ""Independence Day""), David Krumholtz (""Partners"" and lots of character roles), Peter MacNicol (""Ally McBeal"", ""24"", ""Grey's Anatomy"", and even dozens of animation voicings).

This show takes a unique perspective on crime dramas.  Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) leads an FBI team headquartered in Los Angeles.  One part ""rough and tumble"" and one part thoughtful detective, he initially dislikes having to involve his brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), a math genius professor at nearby ""CalSci"", in a case.  Math to the rescue.  A new crime-fighting dynamic duo (with plenty of help) is born.

The show's producers found a wonderful mix of action/adventure, drama, and the show's math backdrop.  At least once in each show, we are treated to Dr. Eppes' explanation of how he applied math to help solve the problem.  He uses comparisons, common life situations, and even the occasional story to enlighten us without making us feel lectured or foolish.  The graphics interjected by the show's producers while he talks adds to the affect, though I wonder how the poor FBI agents survive without them!

The interaction and relationships among the characters adds to the show's appeal.  These brothers are, well, brothers--loving, supportive, and also competitive.  Parental flavor is added by both dad (Alan Eppes played by Judd Hirsch) and Charlie's mentor and friend, physicist Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNichol).  Love interests show interest here and there, as required for all TV.

This is a fun show and fairly kid friendly, though parents should remember that violent crimes are a common foundation for story lines.",1392422400,,1748,5.305454545454546

After a full season in a fairly short time span, we realize it time to take a break because we don't just accept Charlie's math as the answer for everything.

Yet, it is presented in a way that allows the viewer to somewhat understand how the math helps solve the crime and the math jargon does not get in the way of the story.",1389398400,,391,4.444444444444445
2532986,5,B000ERVJKE,"I was a huge fan of the show, while it aired and remain so watching it on my Kindle HDX. The concept of a mathamatics professor, David Krumhotz, using his specialty to aid his FBI brother, Rob Morrow, to solve crimes was unusual enough to initially peak my interest.  You throw in a good supporting cast, including Judd Hirsch as their father and Peter MacNicol as David's best friend and former teacher, it makes for an entirely entertaining show.  Since I'm starting with Season 1, its interesting to watch the actors develop in their rolls and to watch the stories become slowly more coordinated.  I'm good with numbers, but seldom understand the math concepts utilized in the show, but it does not detract from my enjoyment.  If you've never watch the show, try it.  If you enjoyed it while broadcast, well worth watching again.  I plan to rewatch the entire six seasons.",1389225600,,875,4.723684210526316

2532995,5,B000ERVJKE,"This is one of my favorite shows ever! We were all drawn into this show very quickly. My husband and kids are all math, science, and techies; while my math skills have left much to be desired. This show sparked an incredible desire in me to want to learn math, and we live in a great time to be able to learn what ever we want online!

I'm watching the 1st season again for the 2nd time - this time with our 11 year old - who is doing complex geometry and computer programming using Khan Academy. He enjoys the show, but nearly as much as I - go figure! LOL I think it's because he doesn't see anything unusual about it - all of our kids think the skills and use of math are pretty much par for the course. ""Sure mom, of course you use math for that ... what did you think!?""

Anyway, I'm also working my way through Khan Academy and steadily working through - now that I can take my time with things I didn't really understand before.

I'd like to find more shows like NUMB3RS, that inspire me to ""shoot for the stars"" and go back to learn things I didn't do well with in college and earlier. If anyone has any suggestions - I'm open to suggestions!",1388016000,,1150,4.125

This season includes 13 episodes (4 episodes per disc except the 4th disc, which has 1 episode and some special features). To sum it up, Numb3rs is about two brothers: one works for the FBI and the other is a Caltech mathematician who helps his brother solve some of his cases using math. This description may sound a bit dry, but take my word for it, the chemistry between these actors (and their father, co-workers, and love interests) is very interesting and believable. If you don't like math you will still like the show - you don't have to be a geek - it is a cross between a police drama and a show about family relationships - at least in this season.",1385164800,,750,4.364285714285714

2533021,4,B000ERVJKE,"First, there are so many things to love about Numb3rs. It is intelligent, well written, and interesting on many levels. The storyline follows a brilliant mathematician from CalTech, Charlie, and his brother Don, an FBI agent, as Don relies on Charlies help to solve crime in Los Angeles.

The cast works beautifully together. David Krumholtz as Charlie, Rob Morrow as Don, and the incredible Judd Hirsch as their long-suffering father Alan, handle not only the work issues between Charlie and Don. They also work through the family issues of a family with a jock and a brilliant scientific mind growing up together. Charlie, four years younger than Don, graduate high school together, and Charlie goes off to MIT, taking the mom with him, as Don fights his jealousy of the time that the family puts in on a younger brother who requires intensive education to keep up with his brilliance from the age of three.

The thing I don't like about the show? Don't spoiled, temperamental self-centered attitude. Even thought Charlie has higher government clearance than Don (he consults for the NSA) he still tries to bully Charlie, pushing him around and lording his FBI status over Charlie. Sigh.

Overall? I am rewatching the whole series on Netflix and enjoying it just as much as I did the first time, especially the work of Navi Rawat, Peter McNicol and Diane Farr in exceptional supporting roles.",1380412800,2,1394,4.923404255319149

We love the show so much we own the first five seasons on dvd and still watch it some on Amazon!,1377820800,,286,3.9310344827586206
2533029,4,B000ERVJKE,"I've known about the TV show ""Number3rs"" for years, but as a published writer I always prefer words over numbers. I'm not a math enthusiast. I have never used Algebra beyond in high school.

However, the idea of helping to solve FBI crimes through creating complex mathematical equations and statistical theory is a terrific concept. I have no idea if what Charlie, the brilliant younger brother/Cal-Sci professor, comes up with to help FBI older brother Don and his team is real or can be accomplished (if so ... wow ... that's awesome.) Anyway, I made the leap of faith to believe it can be done (at least on the show), and I've been watching episodes in the same way I devour a bag of M&M's.

The characters are really engaging and believable and I especially like Charlie's best friend, Larry. He gives the show terrific comic relief. ""Number3s"" is definitely worth watching.",1377820800,,879,4.776315789473684

I like the stories and I think it shows how math and statistics aren't just things they tell us we need to take in school.  There are real world applications for high level math and just because you're good at math doesn't mean you're stuck being an actuary or teacher.  There are a bunch of other professions that rely on math,1377216000,,472,4.441860465116279

There are a number of interesting scenarios where mathematical constructs are useful to solve crimes, usually by finding the criminal.

2533057,5,B000ERVJKE,"I don't enjoy straight procedurals.  I prefer to have some character development within the story arcs.  I watched Numb3rs when it was on network television because it was a cop show with a difference and starred Judd Hirsch, an old favorite from Taxi.  It had the action of a cop show combined with interesting math and science, plus the dynamic of a father with his two very different adult sons.

I saw it on the list for my Amazon streaming videos and started binge watching it.  It's been fun and many of the cases still have validity today so it doesn't seem dated.  The only negative is that Amazon doesn't stream great through anything other than my Kindle Fire.  Through my BluRay player, the streaming can lapse and reversing, forwarding and pausing can cause the video to have problems reloading.

Compared to today's crime shows, the violence is not so graphic, but there are some disturbing cases that can deal with adult subject matter.  The people on the show are adults and their relationships are of that nature.  Not a show for young children.  However, the viewer will learn some interesting math and science facts to go along with the crime solving.  A fun show.",1371686400,,1182,4.712195121951219

I think Rob Morrow has never looked better.  He and David Krumholtz are believable as brothers and Judd Hirsch is the kind of father everyone should have.  I can't think of anyone other than Peter McNichol to play Prof. Fleinhart, he's very cute in the part. The stories are, for the most part, good entertainment and generally end well.

I wonder if this could really happen the way it's depicted.  All the characters were well cast and the plot lines were believable.  I don't know if the goal is to get young people interested in serious math endeavors, but I think it might do that.  The relationship between the math professor and his advisee was a little off-putting because it assumed they were interested in each other but the professor was too ""ethical"" and awkward to show his interest in her and, she was helpless to do anything about it.  Get real!  Professional women are usually not the typical ""just waiting for him to make a move"" type.

It is really refreshing to see a show that attempts something so difficult (a show about complex math) that is still able to make it understandable and entertaining. Of course sometimes they throw out a term or equation out of the blue to move the plot along, but for the most part they do a great job with analogies to make it seem feasible.

The premise behind this show is science and math and crime fighting. There are two brothers that share the main spotlight. One is very very smart in math and science. He is a genius with some of the social awkwardness and other problems that come with genius level smarts. The other one, Don, an average in the academic area and has fewer social problems. Don is an FBI man in charge of a unit, and he puts his life on the line solving crimes each day.
The idea behind this show is that Don recruits his brother, the genius, Charlie to help solve the crime using math.

One of the things I like is that most of the characters are very likable. They are enjoyable to watch and it is nice to watch their interactions. I also like the supporting cast. Most of the characters seem very true to life as well. The one exception to this would be Charlie. While there are geniuses it seems that the tv show has him writing too fast, solving problems to quickly. Many of the problems and programming plans he whips up would take much longer than it does for Charlie. But I guess that is TV for you.

Another thing that I have found fascinating is that just about all of these shows are based on true stories.

2533099,4,B000ERVJKE,"I enjoy the acting, writing and most of the plot lines.  I feel at times they are stretching things a bit, but the applied mathematics are generally plausible though.  My mathematics background is in theoretical not applied so I might not be able to accept the way things are used as 100% real.  The beauty is there now exists an interesting show which does not insult the viewer, challenging them a little, which shows there is a use for mathematics in real life beyond using arithmetic functions of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.

The humor is also subtle but it's there.  This is one area I really like as many of the humorous parts are not via belittling rather they are poking fun as silly things we all need to to in order to feel young at heart no matter what our ages.

And don't let the math part put you off as if you in no way need to understand the very advanced theories and their application to real world systems.  There is a lot here for everyone...not a bad family show though the themes can be somewhat more mature due to the crimes investigated.

2533101,4,B000ERVJKE,I love when a program has some level of education inherent in its production and this has it in spades.  Not only does it help you see how math is a part of everthing in our lives but it tackles the battle of interpersonal relationships for the family unit that includes a genius mind.  It is very difficult to understand how a genius can function in typical relationships but this production tries to help us watch this dynamic in action.  I think the writers do a pretty good job demonstrating how difficult it is for a genius to have a strong emotional connection with people that see the world very differently then they do.  It also reminds the audience that good interpersonal relationships involves alot of give and take from both sides.  Any program that makes me consider tough issues and provides multiple perspectives is interesting and thought provoking programming in my opinion.,1361923200,,892,4.803921568627451

Charlie (David Krumholtz) is a mathematician who can statistically provide answers to where the next crime will happen, and who is going to pull it off, given enough data.  It doesn't always make sense to us ""regular"" folk, but eventually we catch on.  Got to love the analogies.  Charlie works with his brother, Don (Rob Morrow), an agent with the FBI.  Charlie finds the bad guy, Don arrests him.  Ying and Yang.  The family dynamic is completed with the father figure, Alan (played by Judd Hirsch).  He's a very smart individual who's always looking to learn and broaden his horizons.  He keeps both of his sons on their toes, corrects childhood memories, explains others.  A good papa.  There are also several other characters at the CalSci University and FBI that are regulars in the program.  Professor Fleinhardt (Peter MacNichol) and Amita Rumatajhan (Navi Rawat) are from the Physics and Math departments at CalSci.  David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard), and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) who work for/with Don at the FBI.

2533138,5,B000ERVJKE,"In recent times, law enforcement agencies from local and state police departments all the way up to the FBI have been using mathematics to solve crimes and apprehend criminals.  For five years on Friday nights, the CBS show ""Numb3rs"" helped show the general public how math is used in law enforcement.

""Numb3rs"" is set in Los Angeles.  FBI agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) encounters many crime cases that can be solved with the help of mathematics, and his brother Charlie (David Krumholtz) is a mathematician who provides the number know-how needed to nab the criminals.  The 13 episodes comprising this first season of the series were originally broadcast in the first five months of 2005--some of the crimes that Don and Charlie team up to solve in the first season include kidnapping, murder, bank robbery, counterfeiting, sniper killings, and even a jail break.

This DVD set includes all 13 episodes and some bonus material concerning the development and casting of the series.  There is one flaw on this set--on the second disc, if you attempt to play the ""Counterfeit Reality"" episode from the main menu, the wrong episode plays.  The workaround to this conundrum is to use the Play All option and use the chapter fast-forward button on your remote--eventually you will hit the ""Counterfeit Reality"" episode and it will play successfully.

Morrow and Krumholtz play their roles perfectly, and the supporting cast is outstanding as well, including Judd Hirsch as Alan, the father of Don and Charlie.  The characters are likable and have great chemistry in a low-key sort of way.  ""Numb3rs"" is great television.  I regretted that I never tuned into the series until last March 12 (which turned out to be the series finale!) but am glad that the series is available on DVD.

That is all appropo since Charlie, the Math Whiz, explains each episode how math relates to everyone and everything while helping his brother to solve cases using algorhythms and equations that explore the details of the crime scenes and criminals.  The main star, in real life, said he was very poor in math in school so he wanted to make sure that non-math types could understand and enjoy the show. I can and I do!!

Listening to mathematical principles broken down into every day talk is fun, seeing the ultimate usefulness of math is nifty. I also enjoy that I can watch this with my 80 year old prude of a mother without blushing.
While those are the things that will keep me watching into season 2 I feel compelled to add that although I like the characters and while there is chemistry between them I don't ""care"" about them as individuals. Even after a complete season if something happened to one of the main characters it wouldn't be a big deal. This may be because the show dwells very little on the characters as ""real people"", you get little snippets of seeing their human vulnerabilities but not much. It may be this aspect that has made it impossible for ""suspension of disbelief"" to occur. Without this natural tendency to ignore inconsistencies that appear in stories I spend the entire show thinking, ""Oh, right, it's no problem to build a totally new working mathematical model with no time"" or ""Oh, he's a prodigy so he's good at just about anything.""

2533147,5,B000ERVJKE,"Television has had a love affair with cop and detective shows for decades, from Dragnet through Hill Street Blues to CSI -  Large-Metropolitin-City-of-your-Choice.

The best ones endure in memory and frankly make compelling viewing.  Not meaning to cast stones, but the mediocre ones are the television equivalent of cotton candy.  There are a few (The Mentalist) that almost, but don't QUITE reach the highest heights.

Right now there are two ""cop shows"" that started with a unique angle, then added great casts and writing.  In my mind ""NUMB3RS"" joins ""Dexter"" at the top of the current police heap.

Both have writing - dialogue and storylines - that easily match up with the best cop movies.  (Why couldn't someone have provided a better vehicle for Pacino and De Niro than ""Righteous Kill"", which looks like a high-school production compared to Dexter and Numbers?)  But I digress.

NUMB3RS is the ""genius"" drama. (The Big Bang Theory is the genius comedy, and it really IS comic genius.)  Rob Morrow, from another of our favorite shows, Northern Exposure, shows impressive range.  On NE his Dr. Fleischman was a slight of stature New York Doctor transplanted to Alaska.  In NUMB3RS he plays Don Eppes, a tough dedicated-to-his-career FBI professional with commanding stature. Almost every episode features Don and a team of FBI professionals storming a room with weapons brandished.  On ""Exposure"" he played the intellectual.  Although Eppes is not dumb - he's an observant professional - Don is easily the least intelligent of the leading characters.  Don's math genius brother is Charles, played by David Krumholtz.  Five years younger than Don, Charles has become an internationally renowned mathematician.  The sibling rivalry angle provides many plot points, and we see goes back to the time that Charles graduated in the same high school class as Don - only at age thirteen.

Charles, now 30-ish, still lives at home with their father, played brilliantly with heart and intelligence by Judd Hirsch.

Don was building his federal law enforcement career away from home until their now deceased mother became sick.  The series begins apparently soon after their mother's death, leaving a house with two men, frequently visited by still-single brother Don.

Alimi Ballard is solid as a fellow FBI man, and Navi Rawat looks like a young Catherine Zeta-Jones as a graduate student who studies under Charlie. Peter MacNicol gets another hit TV show (after Ally McBeal and 24) as a physicist colleague of Charlie.

The show is equal parts brains and heart - contemplation and action.  Almost every episode has me at the edge of my seat, and while the scripts sometimes require at least a momentary suspension of disbelief, they are smart and not insulting.

As cop shows go - right now NUMB3RS is good enough to spend my time.",1254787200,3,2831,5.049568965517241

I don't know why I avoided this for so long, because its a great, great crime drama with a strong human element.  Yes, there's plenty of action to go around, but Numb3rs also focuses on the cerebral ways that number theory could be used to solve crime.

There's very little not to like about this show...at times, the Feds make decisions that I would surmise ""real"" FBI agents would not, huge mistakes in protocol that add drama to the show but pull from the believability.  Still, I totally forgive these lapses and really enjoy the honesty and down-to-earth nature of the characters on the show, even when they are using Einstein-level jargon.

Anyway, all I got was a lot of gross images of murdered women in a plot revolving around a serial killer in LA but not a pilot epiode that introduced me to the characters.  (The pilot for the Heroes series is my idea of a good pilot episode.)

A good pilot episode should develop characters, and by the end of this I felt grossed out but not like I really knew any of the characters in the series.  Even Sabrina Lloyd was a disappointment as it seemed that all she did was glower.  I read she left after the first season, and if this is all they did with her, I could understand why.

If you look at this show in isolation, it's just another CBS crime show, and the math is somewhat forced in spots, but I watch it more for the interplay between the Eppes brothers and the action scenes than any understanding of p vs. np and advanced number theory. I haven't missed an episode yet, and I would highly recommend all 3 seasons to any fan of crime dramas.

That being said, I'm not sure if this is an Amazon problem or what, but every set of DVDs I have purchased so far has had some kind of malfunction, usually one disc out of the set that doesn't work, or will play episodes up to a point and then not the remainder. My computer will freeze and no amount of button-pushing or wiping down the CD will fix it, and I usually end up missing 2-3 episodes out of a season.

What was really sad is when I saw the first show, and the first algorthim they talked about I thought, ""I know that algorithm."" then groaned as I realized that not only did I know it and use it, but I'd programmed it!

Definitely start with the first season.  I did not start watching the show until the end of the first season and thus I missed a lot of the character development until after watching the DVD.  If you have also lately joined the Numb3rs craze on tv try and view the first several shows soon (buy or borrow).

Being Hollywoodish at times it is definitely too violent and has the occasional unnecessary inappropriate scene.  Overall quite enjoyable and it even sometimes succeeds in making math seem cool.",1176336000,3,692,4.822033898305085

2533181,5,B000ERVJKE,"My wife forced me to watch this show because she is an Engineer who is totally into math.

I think a coworker told her about it and we started recording it and watching it.  Now we are buying the series on DVD.

I have been burned out on cop shows for years, but this show really does a good job of telling a story, and even a good job of making points related to stories in today's headlines.  Sometimes it slides a little too far to the sappy human side with backstory or a little bit of romantic drama (which I hate) but for the most part they keep it to a minimum and even so it's done tastefully.

Like most TV shows, some of the early episodes are kind of what I would call ""clunky"" but still well done.  I really have enjoyed watching this series.

I wish they would add some features to the DVD, mainly subtitles.

I am sure it's closed captioned but I really like watching shows with the subtitles turned on, especially shows where I need to know what is going on.  When the kid is asleep it's hard to turn it up loud enough because sometimes the music is loud or there are gunshots and explosions.  Maybe on DVD releases for one of the future seasons they'll figure that out.

I'll still keep buying it though.",1168128000,2,1220,4.2155172413793105
2533182,5,B000ERVJKE,"If your TV has Closed Caption Capibility, it works fine with this set :-)

NUMB3RS is a great show on so many levels. I especially love the Geek Speak between Charlie and Larry.

NUMB3RS has FBI issues, car chases, gun shoot-out with the bad guys, and dinner at home with Charlie, Don and ""Dad"" Alan. Gotta love when Dad (Judd Hirsch) says ""Let's watch TV, you know the Classics are on late at night"", and the Theme from ""TAXI"" plays.....",1168041600,,438,4.4625
2533183,5,B000ERVJKE,"Numb3rs is a very smart, exciting crime drama about two reconnecting brothers and their various friends.  Of course all their friends happen to be FBI agents or various professors of math or science.

This series is full of interesting characters, and math.  I like the intellectual element Charlie brings, without seeming arrogant.

Thank God for a show about math that's finally interesting!",1164067200,5,393,5.290322580645161
2533184,5,B000ERVJKE,Numb3rs is a fantastic television program that my family enjoy watching on a weekly basis.  It is fun to watch a show that requires some thought process.  The actors do a superb job.,1162684800,3,182,4.484848484848484

2533186,4,B000ERVJKE,"NUMB3RS is a fascinating, original crime drams where much of the crime is solved by the genius of mathematics along with some good old fashioned police work, this time the FBI.  The first season gives us much of the background on its cast of characters:  Rob Morrow is the dedicated FBI sgent who gave up his previous assignment when his mother was dying of cancer and he came home to LA to be with his family; David Krumholtz is his younger brother Charlie, who is a mathematical genius, but also somewhat a loner in his personal relationships; Judd Hirsch is their father, the anchor in the family lineage trying to keep in touch with his disparate sons; Alimi Ballard and Sabrina Lloyd are Morrow's fellow agents; and Peter Macnicol hangs around as Charlie's mentor and advisee.

Sometimes the pacing seems a little slow and the mathematical explanations a little cumbersome; the progress of the family dynamics is probably necessary but sometimes it seems a little forced, as though they had to have something for Hirsch to do; but it all ties together quite nicely, and it's a worthy addition for television crime show afficionados' DVD library.",1159401600,3,1150,4.857142857142857
2533187,5,B000ERVJKE,"Now here's an enticing premise for you. FBI agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) enlists the aid of his math-genius brother, Charlie (David Krumholtz) in the solving of Los Angeles crimes.  The show's rather exotic plots make great use of two worlds, the FBI, and the college campus of CalSci, doubling for CalTech. One would expect to get the usual sort of felons--snipers, mad bombers, arsonists, terrorists--- and, yes, you'll find them all here but the show works very well as a whoddunit with the clock almost running out the hour before we bust our bad guy (or girl) who by the way is always predictably but not disappointingly the least likely suspect.  But where this show sets itself apart from the standard crime-solver genre is in the ""howdunnit"" portion of the story and supplying these answers is the brilliant research team of CalSci genius, Charlie, his colleague, Amita, and, of course, the sometimes enigmatic but always entertaining,  Dr. Fleinhardt.  A very able supporting cast, great editing, and snazzy photography add to the appeal of this fine CBS show. Especially fun is the college physics genius, Larry Fleinhardt, played by Peter MacNicol. One only wishes they made more use of him.  His background in quantum physics makes for some very lively discussions between himself and the  harder number-crunched views of his former student, Charlie.  And speaking of wanting more of something,  I wouldn't mind seeing more of that campus. It's such a great backdrop and such a natural frame for a show where the chalkboard as much as a chalk outline spells Murder!",1159142400,5,1577,4.99236641221374
2533188,4,B000ERVJKE,"As someone who actually understands quite a bit of math, I can say that the show's mathematical angle actually makes sense about 1/3 of the time, and when it does, the show is great.  The other 2/3 of the time, the math is just mumbo-jumbo, and the show ends up being pretty similar to other crime procedurals.  Even those episodes are good, though in a more traditional way.  (They allegedly have a CalTech mathematician on retainer to make sure the math makes sense.  But it's hard to come up with a distinct way for real math to solve 22 crimes a year, so I think the expert often just supplies technical-sounding language and cool-looking but mostly irrelevant equations.)

I must disagree with the previous reviewer who criticized Peter MacNicol's portrayal of Fleinhardt.  To me, he's the most believable character on the show -- very much the abstract academic thinker.  His presence allows for direct nerd-to-nerd conversation, and MacNicol carries it off with geeky charm.  Without him, I'd have a hard time buying the premise that Charlie is really a genius professor instead of a forensic scientist.  Fleinhardt is what keeps one of Charlie's feet in the academic world.",1159142400,5,1181,4.924242424242424

Without getting into the relative merit of the content or the series itself---which is extraordinary, unique and quite special---the Numb3rs Season 1 DVD set meets every professional criteria that could be asked for.  The pricing is reasonable. The ""extra features"" are plentiful and interesting. The ""extras"" are even closed-captioned (with the episode dialogue), which is something I haven't seen before.  The makers of this product really used a lot of care and love in releasing it, and it makes a worthy addition to any TV series collection.  The packaging, content and arrangements are all first rate.  No less than five episodes have commentaries.

2533190,1,B000ERVJKE,"I bought this DVD on the recommendation of the positive reviews which it gets here. Expecting some clever math and a good plot line, I was very disappointed. I give it one star because, to be fair, it certainly does have some clever math concepts. Sadly, the script writers focus all their attention on the math at the expense of the characters. Basically the story is about 'cop guy' and his supposedly nerdy brother 'math guy'. Together they solve crimes with the occassional help of 'male African American cop sidekick', 'female blonde cop sidekick', a 'physics guy' and an occasional 'female math sidekick'. These characters get to say things like: ""I'm on it!"" and ""Are you all right?"" Even the sub-plot is about the boys' relationship with their father (the mother is dead). There is no strength given anywhere to any of the female or ethnic minority characters. No wonder the great Sabrina Lloyd left after the first season. Please sirs, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, I would like to politely suggest that people who are not white men can a) occasionally offer an original idea and b)not be constantly worried that their colleagues are eating and sleeping enough.

2) some of the original music that appeared during its original airdate has been changed or dropped altogether.  To me, this means I'm not getting the complete first season as it aired.

3) on disc 2, the third episode is suppose to be ""Counterfeit Reality"".  But what really plays is ""Sabotage"", which is the 2nd episode on this disc.

There are numerous reports about user operation problems with the menu navigation on these discs. I can personally confirm this problem, having watched them over the weekend.

Certain episodes when selected, offer the option of director's commentary. When you make a selection (yes or no) you are often brought to the wrong episode (usually one you've just watched). It's a real pain, and exists on all of the discs with directors commentary. I've found that my 'best' dvd player had better luck, but still not 100%. The only way I was able to watch all of the episodes was by selecting the 'play all' option on the menu... then  skipping through til I found the episode I wanted.

I've also heard there may be problems getting the closed captioning subtitles to work, although I cannot personally confirm this (having returned my rentals already). If that feature is a concern, you may want to do more research.

If you can get past the operational errors, the show itself is very well done. Very unique storys with interesting characters. I was unhappy to find Sabrina Lloyd's charater not return for season 2.

I really like the show, and was disappointed to see find the manufacturing/mastering errors show up. Personally, I wouldn't recommned making a purchase til the problem is fixed by the mfg.",1150156800,26,1476,4.884

The disks overlap inside the case, rubbing against each other. And the disk case is not designed to close (only fold), so the disks fall out almost automatically.

I'm not much of a TV watcher generally speaking, but ""Numb3rs"" has really impressed me as a quality show from the get-go. My spouse and I always make it a point to be home Friday night to catch the latest episode, so we were both pretty excited that season one has been released on DVD. Since we don't have cable, and surrounding high-rise buildings hinder antenna reception (ah, yes, life in the big city), it has been especially nice to see the episodes again, only this time in clear and crisp digital.

So what makes this show so good? Lots of things, I suppose. I particularly like the combination of Charlie and Don as a crime-fighting team, their skills and personalities complimenting each other. With Charlie you get the latest incarnation of the classic figure of the detective who uses reason and logic to solve the crime (going all the way back to Edgar Allan Poe's Dupin in ""The Purloined Letter"" not to mention Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes), and with Don you of course get the cop with a badge and a gun who saves the day (a mainstay of American TV for decades). That said, both actors flesh these archetypes out really well into individual characters, and their brotherly interaction (with a dash of sibling rivalry) creates just the right dynamic.

The math angle is handled extremely well, too. My spouse the mathematician assures me that the higher math Charlie spouts is for real (even if it can't quite catch the bad guys quite so efficiently--cue temporary suspension of disbelief here), and yet for a humanities type like me who knows just enough math to unbalance the checkbook the show's writers and producers do a fine job of translating such mathematics into terms that make sense to the non-expert, often using visual asides to illustrate the principles involved in clever, creative ways. In general, too, the atmosphere and character of academia (with Charlie's physicist friend and all) is portrayed pretty accurately and authentically, which is extremely rare for TV shows...and movies, for that matter.

Finally, on the more basic level, there is just the good old-fashioned pure enjoyment of watching the good guys catch the bad guys.

To make a long story short (I know, too late), this is a fine TV show that is well worth having in one's collection of DVDs.",1149206400,56,2360,4.791154791154791
2533210,5,B000ERVJKE,"I absolutely LOVE Numb3rs. The cast is awesome and they make you think long and hard about each case and lets you make your own scenario about who you think did what in each episode. Each episode has so many twists and turns that it keeps you on the edge of your seat. My husband and I have watched it form the start and will continue to do so as long as the writers come up with good ideas. Each actor is AWESOME, from the veteran actor, Judd Hirsch all the way down to the new agent, Diane Farr. It's good to see a show come along that makes the youth of our nation want to learn about numbers/math.  I can't wait to see the season finale for the second season.",1147392000,14,663,4.061068702290076
2533211,5,B000ERVJKE,"- more of this kind of production.

These guys should get some kind of congressional medal or something.

The good guys are good guys - even though they're normal.

Math, science, logic and thinking are all GOOD THINGS - but not deified.

Even the geek is a good guy and his friends actually watch out for him.

No gratuitous immorality or bad language - isn't that amazing?

Sure, sometimes there's a bit of a leap and occasionally conclusions are drawn that aren't necessarily inevitable, but it's a good show.

It's even entertaining.

Maybe these guys could take over PBS?

Here's an idea. Someone should write a book that takes each episode and fully explains the math and the concepts involved. The audience is already interested.",1147219200,28,736,4.824
2533212,5,B000ERVJKE,I have watched Numb3rs ever since it came out and it became my favorite show.  I saw every episode of the first season and I thought the show turned out to be one of the biggest tv hits this century.  I can't hardly wait to see the current seasons' finale.  I know many people who praise the show for it's excellence and the enjoyment the viewers recieve.  I apprieciate the skill and mastery with which the actors do their job.  We are glad they do what they do and love the show for it.,1147132800,11,488,4.148936170212766

2533214,5,B000ERVJKE,"""We all use math everyday"" says Charlie Eppes, the lead character in the CBS mathematical drama NUMB3RS. Trying to convince an 8th grade math class about that became easier with this show on the air. I've enjoyed the show since day one. Crime drama that makes you think.

Teachers out there may not be aware that the show has a web site that offers lessons based on each episode. Upper level middle and high school students can be challenged by these activities created with help from Texas Instruments and The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. I am pleased to say some of the authors also participated in the Rutgers Leadership Program in Discrete Mathematics, a course I had the pleasure of taking way back in 1996.

2533215,5,B000ERVJKE,"Putting this series on DVD so quickly makes me very happy! From episode 1, I've enjoyed getting a glimpse into the esoteric world of Mathmatics--what a clever idea is is to turn a routine cop show into a blend of math theories and FBI investigative ploys.

The characters are really the soul of the series though, and David Krumholz gets the first role I've ever seen him in that allows him to be attractive.  His ""Charlie"" is brilliant, vulnerable, and very funny---not just the braniac caricature he's usually stuck doing.  It's good to see Rob Morrow again, too.  This show isn't as quirky and his former NORTHERN EXPOSURE, but it's very pleasing all the same.  It's also good to see Judd Hirsh regularly in a series.  He has the suitable gravitas to pull this off.

I look forward to many hours of diversion with this.",1144800000,,822,4.627586206896551

Unfortunately I have so heartily diliked season two which has negated just about everything I liked  about the first that I'm not really sure I would want to buy the DVD now. Season two has become just another blow 'em up shoot bang cop show with superficial characterisations and nowhere near enough of the math (or the mathematician) to make it interesting.
