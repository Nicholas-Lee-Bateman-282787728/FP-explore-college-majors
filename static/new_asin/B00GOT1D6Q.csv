6095778,5,B00GOT1D6Q,"Many years ago in my training days as a clinical psychologist, I saw a Korean-American teenage girl who was adopted from South Korea. She was in the depths of depression and utterly silent in many of our sessions.  I think a film like this would have given her a beginning for finding her voice.

Jung Henin is in his 40's now.  He grew up in a time when adopted children weren't  raised with an understanding of the culture they left behind.  His sense of abandonment and being an outsider comes to a head as a teenager.  The adult Jung who animates this film has made it through to the equanimity of adulthood and a life in art and storytelling.  His deft depiction of the mannerisms and relationships between siblings --adopted or not --- is hilarious and familiar. It's not a linear narrative, but whose life is in memory or its telling and retelling?",1421366400,4,855,4.549019607843137
6095779,4,B00GOT1D6Q,"A heartfelt, unique, mostly animated film, this off-beat documentary is the autobiographic tale of co-director Jung's adoption in Korea by a Belgian family when he was a young orphan. It gives a good sense of the strangeness of leaving your homeland and culture at age 5, and the difficulties of growing up in with a family where you don't look like everyone else.

It's particularly effective at capturing the lingering paranoia that you're not always loved as deeply as the 'real' kids, and suggests there may even be some hints of truth in that fear re Jung's adoptive parents, at least from a child's perception. And yet the film is ultimately embracing of his adoption, without denying its challenges.

Jung himself has grown-up to be a successful illustrator, and his drawings form the basis of the animation that make up about 80% of the film (the rest are old home movies and stills, along with shots of the adult Jung pondering, and visiting Korea).

So why don't I love the film more? It's brave, honest, and different. But it sometimes feels both emotionally muted and repetitive. As personal as the story is, the stylistic choices, while interesting, make it feel like a fable more than a person's real experience. This is fed by the adult Jung's narration being read by an actor, not the man himself. And there is something artificial in that performance.

I watched the film twice, and appreciated it both times, but was never quite as swept up in it as I longed to be. That may be my loss, my limitation. I can imagine someone else being deeply moved. One to see for yourself.",1419984000,2,1591,4.712230215827338

6095783,3,B00GOT1D6Q,It was interesting.  Liked the animation/life mix.  But the ending was kind of abrupt.,1461801600,,86,5.071428571428571

6095785,5,B00GOT1D6Q,"This made me laugh and cry. It showed me a life I have never considered and did it beautifully. I could relate to the narrator and his story in many ways( especially as a child going through a rough time and escaping through drawing) and I am so happy I watch this film. Thank you, Jung!",1460764800,,287,4.142857142857143
6095786,5,B00GOT1D6Q,It was an enlightening fact for adopted children.,1458086400,,49,5.25

6095788,5,B00GOT1D6Q,Very beautiful and touching film. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Would have like to see more if the adult Jung in real life reflecting and feeling.,1450656000,,141,4.68
6095789,4,B00GOT1D6Q,"Slice of life is not normally my style, but this is an honest tale, in the French style of documentary cinema. The animation is without embellishment, yet this too helps communicate who the narrator/adoptee is and was. It is refreshing after being beaten over the head with specific intent by so many recent American documentaries. There are lessons to observe but the viewer is left to form their own opinion.",1446940800,,410,4.871428571428571
6095790,5,B00GOT1D6Q,Beautifully done.,1444953600,,17,8.0
6095791,5,B00GOT1D6Q,"This is one of my favourites movies, I love the animation and how they mix it with some live action scenes. The story is wonderful, amazingly touching and emotional (even when that emotion is hate in some parts) whether it is completely true or half fiction or somewhat exaggerated through the eyes of a child. Simply a Masterpiece.",1441843200,,332,4.741379310344827
6095802,1,B00GOT1D6Q,Seems like Jung held on to all the memories of being chastised when he was growing up. He showed no love or gratitude toward his adoptive parents and did not attempt to portray their love for him until the very end. He gave a very negative slant to what it meant to grow up Asian in a Caucasian family. His conclusion regarding the death of his adopted Asian sister also seems to point the finger at the lack of love she was given. This movie would make any future adoptive parents think twice about what to expect.,1441584000,,515,4.319587628865979

6095807,4,B00GOT1D6Q,"This film was not what I expected. It told a story that I have only a vague second hand knowledge of. Lots of movies and dramas explore adoption in South Korea, but not what happens to these adopted children afterward. The story felt very honest. Feelings of being less loved, not a real member of the family and isolation must be familiar to many adopted children. I can only be a spectator, as I am not adopted. I sympathized a lot with the main character. I found his struggle with identity to be understandable and quite a sad reality for so many children around the globe. I didn't understand some of his choices in life, but people are complex beings. The alternation between real life and animation was entertaining and allowed for some creativity. I enjoyed that aspect of the film, especially because Jung is a talented artist. It could have delved a little deeper into Jung's thoughts and motivations, but it definitely gave viewers insight into his view of the world. I loved his thoughts as he reflected on his childhood as an adult. Perspective really does change things. I really enjoyed the movie overall and would recommend it to anyone. It could be eye opening in regard to the realities many adopted children face. It could also be comforting if you happen to be one of those children.",1428710400,4,1303,4.6695652173913045
6095808,4,B00GOT1D6Q,Good movie,1426550400,,10,4.5
6095809,5,B00GOT1D6Q,I'm still thinking about it. An artistic and emotional movie that will move and inspire. Beautifully done.,1425513600,,106,5.294117647058823

6095811,3,B00GOT1D6Q,"I would have much preferred to see real actors displaying real feelings. I did like the animation and the drawings per se, but this mode of presentation oversimplifies a wlhole set of real, complex issues.",1425081600,,205,4.885714285714286
8625650,5,B00GOT1D6Q,A wonderful movie! I enjoyed watching it.,1510790400,,41,5.0
8625651,5,B00GOT1D6Q,"Very well-done story of a boy adopted into a French family. The boy himself, now an adult in his forties, tells it through his animated art. The family meant well but were not prepared for him to need adjustment time. They adopt another orphan from the same country and haven't learned from the experience with this artist. Part of the storyline includes what happens as the adopted orphans grow older. The same kinds of addictions are used to numb themselves as we find worldwide, alcohol, drugs and in some cases suicide.

I don't see this as against adoption. It urges mentoring of both the adopted child and the family accepting the child into their home. A really beautiful piece. Thank you, Jung Henin.",1481932800,,708,4.7560975609756095
8625652,4,B00GOT1D6Q,What an incredible story.  I'm sure that many have gone through the same as him.  It's also a good reminder of what a struggle it is to be different but also so loved by his family.  Great story.,1481328000,,195,4.078947368421052
8625653,5,B00GOT1D6Q,Well done. I think that this is important for adoptive parents to view this. It opened my bio teens eyes to racial stereotyping.,1478476800,,128,4.608695652173913

8625655,5,B00GOT1D6Q,"Conscience living has nothing to do with not being able to bare a child of our own, or physical health.  Mental and spiritual health is equally important, and helps the whole world.  We must adopt conscience living, and this isn't a request, suggestion, or choice.  Thousands of years and all we've evolved, is technology.  Without evolving the soul, we just run in place, becoming more spoiled and dependent.  Waste.... but, not this film... exquisite .",1477958400,,454,5.0
8625656,5,B00GOT1D6Q,"This is a well made, beautiful and yet painful to watch movie. You can feel the pain and confusion of being abandoned as a toddler and adopted.
The combination of Jung's drawings and real footages of the events made this movie very interesting.",1476403200,,244,4.6976744186046515
8625657,4,B00GOT1D6Q,Very well done. I really liked the drawings. My heart went out to him. I'd liked to have gotten more information about Jung's life now and the rest of his family. I also felt that there were gaps in the story.,1476057600,,209,4.121951219512195
8625658,5,B00GOT1D6Q,Brought many things home for.  As Jung I also was an adoptee from Korea.  Everything that he went through I did in some way or form...  We must realize that adoptees from different countries go through an indenty crisis.  Sometimes we learn and sometimes we don't.,1474934400,,264,4.673913043478261
8625659,5,B00GOT1D6Q,Awesome movie you wouldn't imagine because it's in cartoon format but you'll laugh and cry trust me! It's based on a true story!!,1473638400,,129,4.6521739130434785
