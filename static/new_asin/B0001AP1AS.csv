1985354,5,B0001AP1AS,"The pluses: a) the great interpretation of Boris by Evgeny Nesterenko at his very best; b) the performances of the legendary Irina Arkhipova as Marina and of Alexander Piavko; c) the magnificent chorus and orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre; d) Maestro Boris Khaikin at the podium; e) the colourful settings and the luxurious dresses; f) an overall good camera work, and a fairly good digital transcription of image; g) last, but not least, the very low price.  The minuses: a) The quality of sound, although not bad, much below the possibilities of the current digital technology; b) no undertitles at all (a shame in the digital era); c) the booklet, though existing, contains no references to this performance (cast, tracks,etc); d) some viewers may prefer the original Mussorgsky version (the outstanding Kirov-Royal Opera version conducted by Gergiev is available on DVD).  The balance: This is the very best and most authentic Rimski version of Boris Godunov.  Given the low price, the Rimsky version deserves a place in your collection, even if you have the Kirov version as well.  The pluses so largely exceed the minuses, that the DVD deserves 5 stars.",1078876800,12,1159,5.052356020942408
1985355,4,B0001AP1AS,"Hopefully, someone more qualified to write a review will also contribute, but as an opera lover, here's my 2 cents. If I had known this was originally filmed in 1978, I would have missed this little treat. The video and audio quality are poor by today's standards, and I was disappointed that there are no subtitles. But, if you can overlook these shortcomings you will find everything you would expect from the Bolshoi Opera. The singing, acting and costumes are spectacular, and there are several brilliant operatic choruses. Definitely worth watching!",1076630400,5,554,5.0989010989010985
8009410,4,B0001AP1AS,"This is a classic performance, but unless your Russian is good, you'll probably want subtitles, which this DVD lacks. The Kultur DVD of this same performance, while no great technological triumph in other ways, does have English subtitles:

8009411,1,B0001AP1AS,"This is a very poor copy of the 1978 Bolshoi performance on the Kultur label.  The picture is blurry, the sound seems to come from underground.  A shameful production.",1268611200,,167,4.724137931034483
8009412,5,B0001AP1AS,The greatest Russian opera by the greatest Russian opera composer (I much prefer him to Chaikovsky). The performance is outstanding and Nesterenko is in top voice. I wish that Martti Talvela were still around.,1182902400,,209,5.176470588235294
8009413,5,B0001AP1AS,I feel it would be churlish to over criticize this performance which is very old fashioned in many ways.  But I found it very moving. The only thing I would have changed is to have less make up on the woman who played the Tsar's son.  She does a great job singing and acting but is made to look too beautiful. While I am not fond of the Tenor's sound I feel that he does a good job.  He acts well and has all the notes.  Of course the big assets are seeing both Arkhipova and Nesterenko at their best. There is nothing to wish for in Nesterenko's performance which is a joy to watch and hear.  The care with which this performance is presented by all the forces involved make it a highly recommended experience.  I have not seen any of the more recent DVDs of this opera but am fully satisfied by what I see on this disc.,1150070400,,821,4.1
8009414,3,B0001AP1AS,"Amazon.com really needs to do a better job identifying opera DVDs without subtitles.  This ""Boris"" doesn't have any.  Still, it's a bargain at the price...if just to see the amazing acting and the great costumes.",1118707200,4,212,5.0285714285714285
8009415,5,B0001AP1AS,"If you are a carper you can point out that the lack of English subtitles lessens your appreciation of the whole, even when you know the storyline it would be nice to be able to follow along

with the monologues. Having said that,the Boris of Nesterenko is overwhelming, he dominates the stage with his presence and completely overshadows his colleagues vocally. That is not to say that there is not some very, very fine singing on the part of the other singers, it is just that Nesterenko is so magnificent, his part alone is worth the admission fee. Throw in great scenery, costumes, and the great work of Khaikin and the orchestra and you have a Boris for the ages. C. Velliadis.",1107216000,8,681,4.581967213114754
8009416,5,B0001AP1AS,"This is a close as you'll get to this work's inner soul. It also makes you wonder, how many more filmed or taped great performances, not just of this seminal work, so dear and close to that great theatre that is the Bolshoi, but also of other russian masterpieces, lie gathering dust in the vaults of what in soviet times used to be known as Mosfilm and the All-Union Radio? What will take for an enterprising company to dig them out and rescue them for the DVD public? If this release is a sample of what awaits us in those vaults, then a most mouth-watering one it is!

This performance, caught live at a 1978 performance, always enjoyed some sort of legendary status. Indeed, the cast is phenomenal, the chorus first-rate, the long-seasoned conductor at his most inspired, its reappearance in DVD format deserves a standing applause. It is not perfect, though: there are no subtitles and the DVD mercilessly exposes a few faults and physical deterioration in the master tape, product of what has surely been insufficiently careful keeping. But what a performance it is! You have here the Bolshoi's usual composite of Rimsky-Korsakov's versions (for the original Mussorgski version you'll have to go to the excellent Gergiev-conducted  DVD Mariinski Theatre version of the Tarkovski production originally devised for the ROH Covent Garden): that means a spectacular Coronation Scene (the Musorgski original's main weakness), no parrot-incident narration by the Crown Prince in Act 2, a truncated 3rd Act (the Rangoni intrigues with their odd but wonderful musical figurations altogether absent, we actually see him for a few seconds only, blessing the lovers after that curiously proto-Puccinian duet that closes that so-called ""Polish Act""), but in turn we gain back the St Basil Scene that Mussorgski ended up supressing, much to his regret,  in his final version, with an additional Boris appearance and his dialogue with the fool. So, the fool is present at the Kromy forest revolt only for the scene's end, and there is no Shchelkalov speech before the Boyars in the 1st scene of Act 4, before Shuiski arrives. That act's scenes are presented Kromy revolt scene first, Boris' death later (for a time it was common practice in the USSR to reverse this order, thus reverting back to Musorgski's original).

Nestierenko was a superb Boris, his voice less powerful perhaps than that of other famous exponents of the past, russian or not, like Petrov, Pirogov, Talvela or Christoff but with a tender, lyrical tint that recalls Shaliapin's voice as preserved in 78 rpm discs but without the old man's excessive theatricalities or tinkering with the text in the clock scene. Arkhipova had been around singing Marina since the late 1950's (she portrayed the role in the Melodia 1962 set that preserved for us Ivan Petrov's impersonation of the leading role and appeared for the last time in the same company's 1983 set of the original Musorgski score, with Alexander Vedernikov as Boris) but was still in a very fine voice by 1978 although she no longer could impersonate a physically credible young girl; when she enters the stage for the first time she receives an understandable and deserved ovation from the audience, as she was one of the Bolshoi company's undisputed divas. Vladislav Piavko is a bold False Dimitri, the Pimen is superb, the Varlaam not only a very fine singer but a surprisingly good actor too, all supported as I said before, by an outstanding  chorus that carries this music in their bones, everything enhaced, on top of that, by the magnificence of the venue.

Sound quality is good enaough but variable and, this being caught live (the mikes show aplenty, TV cameras mercifully don't) singers' voice sometimes drop off abruptly or suddenly gain in volume as a consequence of microphone placing. Orchestra players' arrangement follows traditional theatre pit layout and is reflected in the generally good stereo perspective. Images are good and camera work unobtrusive, with good definition. Transfer to the NTSC colour standard from the original 625-line SECAM has been successfully processed.",1104969600,9,4119,5.058910162002945
8009417,3,B0001AP1AS,"Boris is a work of incredible genius, and as other reviewers have noted, there is much to be said for purchasing this production:

* It is beautifully staged, sung, and acted;

* The disc is bargain priced;

* It is the best recording of the Rimsky-Korsakov orchestration on the market.

Unfortunately, it also has its limitations:

* The sound quality is good but not really up to modern standards.  The sound's limitations will be a serious problem if you have state-of-the art equipment.  If, however, you're listening on your TV or through a simple stereo, you may not even notice it.

* The visual quality while very good for its day is less than optimal.  Again, with an old-style TV, this is not a problem.  With HDTV you will be aware of it.

* There are no captions.

* This is only Rimsky's orchestration, not Mussorgsky's own.

Most importantly, it does not compare with Kirov recording on Philips, either technically, dramatically, or as a musical performance.",1100649600,10,972,4.783132530120482
8009418,5,B0001AP1AS,"I have seen several performances of Godunov and have listened to many more.  I always admired it, but I did not ""love"" it.  This performance has changed that.  I expected something heavy and thick and slightly-acidic, like the stereotypical slavic voice production that does not appeal to me.  Instead I got lyricism and voices that were often just plain beautiful.  This score reached out to me this time as never before and I heard detail and melodic filigree that was hidden from me in my past exposures.  Even the quintessential male-voiced Russian chorus sounds were humane rather than simply thundering and roughhewn as they have seemed in past outings.  This seems to me to be a close-to-ideal realization of this opera.  I'm so glad I have it.",1099353600,3,751,4.858267716535433
