3131725,4,B0014F20GM,"when a blu ray is released, it should have all features from subsequent releases on board(or at least the ""better"" ones)... most notably was the bbc special on hunter s(contained on disc 2 of the criterion version).  there was also a small peice with hunter and johnny on the first release dvd(which is the one i own, and now the bluray), thats not included... WHY?????  all in all the film quality is good, but why do they fail to include things released on previous versions?????
disc two from the cc version is the shnizznosh... i also really liked the menu screens from the cc release..

i also own the t2 ultimate edition.. i bought the version before it(used from disc replay) and had to return it cause of skipping, however, the menu screen from that version i think is the best... its basiclly the same in the ultimate edition, except the machines inthe factory are t1000, not t800...  the detail with the t800, like when it goes into his skull to see the chip (chapter navigation), in my opinion is far superior... lol.  its little things like this that irk me...  although the ultimate edition  version of the film is prolly one of the best dvd releases, along with the rereleases of the origional star wars trilogy... they look damn good for dvd..  however i am pretty much now officially moved on to blu ray, and im deciding how worth it it is to double up on certian movies.. like i did for fear and loathing..  but the caddys, the desert, the lights... the effects, every thing in fear in loathing... gilliams vision, all of that was enough for me to double up on this one.. besides its one of my favorite flicks, and i love hst!! and gilliam is one of my fave directors too...  other faves include david lynch, david cronenberg, christopher nolan(i liked him before batman) spike jonez, michel gondry...david fincher is really good too....

edit:  ive since got the criterion release, which came out a month or so after i purchased this version...  if you like this film, don't settle for anything less than the cc release.. the other version, colors aren't right, and the sound dosnt seem to be mixed properly..  in the begining, with toby ""are you prejeudice? i didn't think so"" when he taps his chest, that sound is completly missing... little small details like that ruin it for me.. i noticed that on my first viewing of the initial release..",1293235200,,2362,4.619617224880383

3131728,1,B0014F20GM,"The movie (""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") is about two drug addicts, one of them is played by Johnny Depp. If I'd see him  in such a movie first time I would not buy any movie with him ever! Look at the picture of DVD title. This is what you going to watch through whole film: bunch of hallucinations through eyes of two losers. I couldn't watch more than half movie because it's sick delirium of ravings of a madman. They under drugs influence all the time, sweating and mumbling, doing some stupid mind disorientated things. And there is so much of that stuff in this movie that you can feel like you gonna through up already. What is this? Is this anti-drug propaganda or drugs Ad?
There are good actors in this movie like Johnny Depp, Cameron Dias (""Mask""), Tobey Maguire (""Spider man""), Craig Bierko (""13th floor"") but it doesn't matter. They are in a gross movie.
Do not buy it unless you want to through away your money.

PS Reading all comments to my review, I see that there are people who probably likes that stuff. If you do - Buy this movie it's most likely part of your world.",1289260800,3,1092,4.374384236453202

3131730,4,B0014F20GM,I'm gonna call this abstract art.  The acting was great and you will see some familiar faces throughout the movie.  These were some wild characters and they portrayed the psychotic and psychadelic the way I would imagine.,1278288000,,221,4.945945945945946
3131731,2,B0014F20GM,"I am a person of sound mind and wit. I did not like this film one bit. There was not anything about it that I found particularly memorable, I disliked the characters immensely, it all seemed like an overscripted drama at a nearby theater. This film is considered as a cult classic and yet I happen to be of the cult that doesn't quite dig this. Johnny Depp is one of the most over-rated actors in the industry. I can't help but blame him for how lackluster and robotic his acting made this. I do not recommend this film at all.

The Blu Ray probably has a better detail level so when the actors are tripping on dinosaurs and dim lights, there is better detail to zero in on how boring the film really was. I'm a big White Rabbit fan but they ruined the song in this unfunny roller-coaster.",1277856000,,789,4.26

3131734,1,B0014F20GM,"I will preface this review by stating that I have never read the book upon which this movie is based. I purchsed this DVD based upon the list of actors. I was truly disappointed with this movie in that I kept waiting for something -- anything -- reasonable and sensible to happen. Alas, it was not forthcoming. The continual narration by Depp's character did not work for me as it really did not add anything close to approximating coherency. The cameo by Bussey was good; however other than that watch this movie only if you are familiar with the book and have an extra two-hours of your life to spend.",1272240000,3,603,4.490909090909091

Seems every time I watch this I see something that I didn't notice before, like the scene where he's at a scrapyard on a payphone and the footage is running backwards, or when he's having an acid flashback and he sees the actual Hunter S. Thompson in the club.  The first time I watched this I was cracking up so hard during the entire Bazooko's Circus scene that I could hardly breath.  Johnny Depp was great in this role and he and Del Toro have great chemistry.  Cameos a-plenty.  Good soundtrack.

This was gonzo journalism.

Thompson remains one of my heroes and this book (sure, movie) is one of the reasons. His consistent efforts to twine his paranoid drug induced smugly-superior-while-completely-overwhelmed schizophrenic behavior with the ""real world"", while showing the real world to be an even weirder parody of his reality, is what made him a great writer and keen observer of the human condition.

It has many extra features including 3 commentary tracks, one by the author, who if you're unfamiliar is the real life main character played by Depp in this movie.

It is really quite hard to wrap your head around the crazy situations and amount of substances these two consume in this classic film by Terry Gilliam. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are are such a sight to see in their roles as Hunter S. Thompson and his Attorney Dr. Gonzo (Z). Depp did some in depth role research with Hunter for weeks, including a period of time in Hunter's basement with only headlamps and necessities (supposedly some LSD too) I've heard. Benicio is everything from a raving lunatic to a cool as a cucumber, soft spoken wise man on a good one. They feed off of each other's energy whether it's for the good, the bad, or the ugly. All in all, it is a hilarious, substance soaked adventure that keeps you guessing ""What are they going to do next?"". Hunter S. Thompson was one of the Great Writers of my Generation (29 yrs. Old). He was raw, descriptive and truthful amongst many other things in life and his work. He was also One Hell of an American who Believed in His Constitutional Rights and Freedom, may he R.I.P. .

I understand that several actors were assigned the lead role while the film was in development hell, but the final choice of Depp was a poor one. In this movie he looks like a child--10 to 12 years old--who is playing at being a grownup, which makes his drunken antics even more disturbing.

Our culture has changed, as well, since this mess was made. Regardless of where you stand on gun control, I don't see how anyone could find it funny to watch a completely stoned individual waving guns around. It's hard to believe that such a thing ever WAS funny.

Of course Terry Gilliam's visual style is on display throughout, and that I why I give the movie two stars instead of one. HIs nightmarish visions add some interest to what would otherwise be a complete waste of time.",1454457600,,941,4.562130177514793

3132575,3,B0014F20GM,"What it is: Psychedelia... I guess.

My wife hates this film and cannot understand why I would ever watch it.

This movie should be seen for it credentials if for nothing else, but you might just hate yourself on the morning: Hunter S. Thompson (the movie is narrated from start to end with his copy,) Alex Cox (of Repo Man (1984) fame,) & Terry Gilliam (who picked it up after Cox.) It does feature some trippy scenes, melting faces and fabrics, lizard people (with what I would guess is a returning, unexplained prop when Johnny Depp shows up with a lizard tail later on,) and lots of general weirdness and bizarre people and behavior, if no other actual genre content.

What story there is: Hunter and his sidekick go Las Vegas to cover a desert race, demolish their hotel room, attempt to leave, then return on a different assignment to cover a D.A. conference and proceed to trash a second hotel room. All the while they mass consume vast quantities of illegal chemicals and appear not to cover anything, really.

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not so much a story as a drug addled road trip to Vegas and back again. It is hard to see what the intent of filming this other than generating a general feeling of disgust (lots of vomit scenes, for some reason or other*.)  The movie is set five years or so after the height of Haight-Ashbury hippiedom (at least according to Thompson.) The Summer of Love is well over by now, and while it is at this point hard to really identify what Hunter S. had to do really with teenaged hippies in San Francisco, he claims to have been there at the time and he seems to understand that whatever happened there is now dead.

Distorted lenses, tilted cameras and light CG (just before the disastrously incompetent CG of the Brothers Grimm movie and the later explosive, Pythonish CG of Parnassus.) The neon Vegas setting adds to the trippy ambiance, and it may well be that the actual point of the movie is simply to recreate a cinematic drug trip.

I would call if a head movie if not for the fact that there could not possibly be any cosmic significance in any of it.

*But which, frankly, after the Python excesses of Mr. Creosote or the behind the scenes secrets of Crunchy Frog, may very well have only a mild effect.",1446422400,,2264,4.4914841849148415

3132639,5,B0014F20GM,"It was once said that the Austrian composer Wolfgang Mozart was ""not a man of this world."" If that was true of Mozart, then Hunter S. Thompson, the original Gonzo journalist, was not a man of this Universe, or any other for that matter. Or maybe, when Thompson came into this universe, he accidentally brought the other one with him. Thompson, the writer of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, was a man whose perspective on life oozed from a pen filled with ink from other dimensions.

Thompson made a following in the 1960's and 1970's with a two-fold avant-garde approach to journalism. Well, ""avant-garde "" is almost too tame a word. His style was the journalistic equivalent to Salvadore Dali or Thomas Pynchon where reality and surrealism become very reluctant bedfellows in a world that seems to have gone mad--or maybe it never really was sane to begin with. The other aspect in addition to Thompson's warped view of the world is his habit of engaging in the lovingly coined term ""Gonzo Journalism"". For those unfamiliar with it, Gonzo Journalism refers to an approach to reporting in which the reporter and/or journalist becomes as important to (or more important than) the story itself, in a kind of self-aggrandizement in which the story and reporter literally become one. And Thompson was, for almost five decades, the quintessential Gonzo journalist. He is sometimes referred to as Dr Gonzo.

As Gonzo journalism is definitely not for all readers, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is definitely not for all movie-goers. If you're shopping for a film to re-affirm certain steadfast precepts of logic, love, ethics, and morality, then your movie-buying dollar needs to be invested elsewhere. But if you're willing to forgo any predetermined expectations about how and what a movie should be, you're in for one hell of a ride. Fear and Loathing is a roller coaster from which you never seem to be able to get off.

The story surrounds a semi-fictional character, Raoul Duke, played brilliantly by Johnny Depp in a role that even the most daring of actors would avoid at all costs. The only other actor brave or foolish enough to step into the twisted world of Thompson was Bill Murray in ""Where the Buffalo Roam"". The difference between Raoul Duke and Hunter Thompson is mainly the spelling. The character is still replete with Thompson's trademark long cigarette, California drawl, and a personality that is at once maddeningly low-key and as deranged as Dracula on speed. The Raoul Duke aka Hunter Thompson character is the type of person you might want to at first avoid by running into the nearest coat closet before peeking your head out to see what this space alien masquerading as a human being will do next. And Raoul Duke goes on this adventure with a side-kick known sometimes as his attorney and also as Dr Gonzo.

The setting for the misadventures of these two interplanetary refugees couldn't be more perfect. Space Alien and his side-kick Godzilla go on a drug-infested trip to the loony-bin surreal capital of the US of A: Las Vegas. Duke is supposed to be covering a motorcycle race for the incomparable Sports Illustrated and gets sidetracked by the amusement park that is the Disneyland for adults. The road trip begins on the infamous two-lane highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in a 1960's convertible that has seen better days--and better owners. Even before they arrive in neon-ville, Depp sees bats all over the sky, but becomes concerned when his partner fails to see them also. He wonders that his partner may be ""losing it"" when he doesn't see the bats that Depp does. During the trip (and the ""trip"") these two maniacs enter Vegas and see strange creatures in and out of hotels, casinos, bars, and even on the race track. And people in particular sometimes show up as reptilian creatures looking to devour Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo.

The result is a kind of endless romp through an amusement park from Hell that never lets up. At one point the drugs have so twisted all of their perceptions of reality that the world has become somewhat akin to the hideout of the Joker in the old Batman TV series from the 1960's, you know where the floor is always slanted to the side. This is the Hunter Thompson world to a tee faithfully executed by probably the only other entity on the planet twisted enough himself to bring this mayhem to the screen: Terry Guilliam of Monty Python fame. (He was the originator of the mad cartoons that combined European Renaissance art with the Python surrealist sensibility between sketches.) The story is a mosaic of drug-inducements that nearly drive the characters insane. I mean, is Las Vegas only the most inane choice of a location to engage in an intense drug-fest? Some have criticized this movie as advocating and glorifying psychedelic drugs, but I disagree. By movie's end I felt there was a reason I don't personally engage in these kinds of ""trips"". Maybe the world is mad enough as it is without using artificial means to make it seem even more insane.",1430870400,,5027,4.793540945790081

3132648,2,B0014F20GM,"The beginning of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (a.k.a. What Its Like to Be Perpetually High in Nevada) is akin to the ending of Psycho: though youve heard its catchphrase before, it feels fresh when you sit down to watch.  When Norman Bates says in his mothers voice that he wouldnt hurt a fly, our skin crawls, whereas in Fear and Loathing, Johnny Depps delivery of We cant stop here; this is bat country is positively hilarious.  Context is key, and we know from the opening credits of Fear and Loathing that were in for a wild ride by literally starting off in one.

I normally don't like films that are one big acid trip (or, in this case, acid, mescaline, weed, ether, etc.), and Fear and Loathing is no exception.  Though, Depps portrayal of late author Hunter S. Thompson is all too entertaining, even if he does become a caricature at times.  I could have watched Depp swat at imaginary bats in that car for hours.

Fear and Loathings plot relies heavily on the audience having a prior understanding of who Hunter S. Thompson was and what he did for a living, else you're left wondering why this middle-aged dude and his lawyer are spending so much time in Vegas, blitzed out of their skulls.

We don't get a grasp on Raoul Dukes (Thompsons alter-ego, as we learn in a great scene involving a parking lot attendant) being a member of the press, covering a race in Vegas, until were about a quarter of the way in, when Duke contemplates via voice-over: What was the meaning of this trip? Was I just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind? Or had I really come out here to Las Vegas to work on a story? Your guess is as good as ours, Duke.

I thought Dr. Gonzos (Benicio Del Toro) being an attorney was a joke.  Surely, an attorney would keep more of a level head when he has a client like Duke, but no, the seduction of the drugs was apparently too great.  Scarily enough, when Gonzo is sober, Del Toro is actually somewhat comprehensible.  (I swear, the dude is like a Puerto Rican Marlon Brando.)

Fear and Loathing is as littered with celebrities as the Vegas strip itself, with quick cameos from the likes of Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, Flea, and Gary Busey, Ellen Barkin, Mark Harmon, Harry Dean Stanton, Penn Jillette, Christina Ricci, and even Verne Troyer (remember him?).  And yes, when Duke sees a future version of himself in a tripped-out haze, that is indeed Thompson, making an uncredited cameo appearance as himself.

Whats interesting is that all of these stars are credited with such bland character titles as Hitchhiker (Maguire), Magazine Reporter (Harmon), or Highway Patrolman (Busey)  a character who clearly has a name, as is indicated by his badge.  This suggests to me that when you're as saturated in drugs as Duke is, and for as long as he is, people lack significance.  Unless, of course, other people being insignificant had nothing to do with the drugs at all.

But the drugs, oh, those are referred to by name of course, and often.  Duke explains nearly every drug they take while they're taking it and the experience that each one brings, hallucinating images of blood-soaked floors and stretched out faces.  Fear and Loathing is as much a love letter to drugs as it is to Nevada (though, I must admit, Im sold on that carousel bar).

One thing that can be said about Depp is that the man surely loves his job, so much so that he makes you want to be an actor, too.  Im willing to bet that this is why he tends to veer toward crazier characters.  Despite the fact that he embodies these roles so perfectly, though, you can always tell that its still Depp under the make-up.  He never loses himself so completely as, say, Tim Robbins did in The Shawshank Redemption  save for maybe his portrayal of Sweeney Todd.

I remember reading that during the filming of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Depps daughter came down with a serious E. Coli-related illness, which no doubt influenced his work, allowing him to bring an exceptional brand of darkness to the role in a performance that ultimately earned him an Oscar nod.  So he didn't win  I doubt he minded.  Depp seems like the kind of person thats grateful to be able to wake up every day and do what he does; an Oscar win would probably be nothing more than a cherry atop an already fulfilling cake.

I remember learning in film class once upon a time that the voice-over technique can be frowned upon, as it is often overused as a lazy method of exposition, rather than the showing, not telling that film is supposed to accomplish.  (Thats why they call them moving pictures.)  Voice-over is rarely done well, though I imagine that its easier to execute it properly when adapting the film from a book, since the material basically writes itself.  What a way to sell a novel.",1426636800,,4788,4.549591598599767

3132745,5,B0014F20GM,"This movie is one of those works of art, kind of like a Tool album, that the casual movie-watcher can dismiss but those of us that get it, treasure it.  The acting is off the charts.  Depp aside, Benecio delivers one of the most powerful, hilarious, intimidating and sickening performances I've ever seen on film.  His scene with Ellen Barkin is as tense as scene as you'd see in any straight-laced drama.  His scene on the rotating bar at Circus Circus is as funny as anything you'd find in a mainstream comedy.  And it goes on and on, scene after scene, a new level of the character acting anywhere from responsible to outright homicidal.  It's something to behold.

The dialogue is wonderful.  It plays like jazz.  On re-watching it I always pick up on a different riff I missed the last time.  An it's infinitely quotable if that's your thing.  ""There he goes -- one of God's own prototypes -- a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production.""

The soundtrack is masterful and perfectly complements the material.  The visual effects and camera work are also perfect for the material.  The sets and details from the vomit on the walls to Tobey Maguires t-shirt are all genius.

It's a masterful work.  I'm almost glad it wasn't a hit when it came out and that the critic's didn't like it.  It makes it feel like I generally do about most things, that the majority of people just don't get it.  But if you've never seen it, please give it a couple watches as with any great piece of art be it a book, painting, song or movie, it deserves more than one look.  ""Don't try and fight it, or you'll get brain bubbles.  Strokes, aneurysms.  You'll just wither up and die.""",1414713600,,1697,4.516447368421052

Sure, there are plenty of drugs in the book, but also commentary on the ""American Dream"" and a good deal of humor and insight. None of that is in the movie and you might as well skip the second half--it's just more of the same.

He was appalled by it and we left half way through. Recently I bought the movie and watched it with out the assistance of someone with narrow views and a jaundiced sense of judgment.
I was blown away by all the performances and had not realized first time around what a star studded cast this was !! With Toby McGuire, Christina Ricci and Cameron Diaz supporting Depp and Del Torro this film was pure genius. Shock value, outrageous humor and total extravaganza. Depp as Hunter Thompson was in his element. Anyone with a sense of humor who was alive in the 70's needs to see this film. If you were alive in the 70's and you don't dig this movie, well, then it's unlikely you were really alive in the 70's.",1389744000,5,854,4.181818181818182

3132873,4,B0014F20GM,"From the very beginning, Terry Gilliam is able to make you want to squirm in your seat from a mix of feeling uncomfortable, laughter, and fear. This might sound like a criticism, but it's actually not. It is the mark of a very well-made movie that succeeds in its goal. The movie chronicles two 'businessmen' who get wasted out of their minds and destroy their lives in Las Vegas, comically and disgustingly. As a commentary of drug culture gone wrong, it might make you never want to ever go near drugs entirely. The slow decay of their sanity is depicted through an interesting blend of cinematography and content, and Terry Gilliam really pulls out the big guns with his absurdist style and knack for the bizarre (circus performing wolverines and martini-drinking lizard people, anyone?) It's not Depp's best performance, but Del Toro is extremely scary in this film, showcasing a powerful performance. Interesting watch if you're looking for something strange and intellectually stimulating.",1376870400,2,995,5.110429447852761

3132976,3,B0014F20GM,"This film depicts an out-of-control drug-induced orgy of destruction and idiocy. That doesn't mean the film is bad, it is just that it is about 150 minutes of chaos that is almost exhausting to observe and virtually impossible to comprehend fully. The film left me with the question: Why would two educated adult men embark upon a drug eating disaster in which their safety is constantly in jeopardy? There are probably many reasons but primarily, the change of human consciousness is positively reinforcing, that the distortion of perception is highly entertaining, and that the bending and melting of reality is a statement of rebellion against the system but also against the futility of trying to live a good productive life in a world of hypocrisy and idiots. The film shows men taking drugs that distort all perception, which they find extremely entertaining, far more than television. This distortion makes them feel good in the wildest, dangerous, hedonistic manner. They lose their humanity. The film actually starts with a quotation from Dr. Samuel Johnson to the effect that men become beasts to escape the pain of being human. This was more than a witty opening to the film, it is actually the meaning of the entire production. The film could be taken at many levels but many folks will be highly entertained by the outlandish foolishness that these drug intoxicated fellows create around them. It is entertaining and I found it kept me absorbed, shaking my head in disbelief, for over 2 hours. But underneath the foolishness, what was being said?  I think it was saying that human existence is not a bed of roses for we are confronted with death, loss, illness, violence, boredom, and a host of other barriers and burdens. We also are fully aware of these pains, for the most part. Yet we have an escape, the escape of changes to our consciousness that makes it all go away and get replaced by another reality and this wild reality is in place until we come back down to our senses and land back into the world of the living. So was this really a film about existentialism?  Only if you are an existentialist.

The image is amazing (whether you care for the movie or not, you HAVE to admit that it's a marvel of set design and special effects), and the audio is very good. Some of the dialogue is hard to understand at times (the fact that the actors mumble many of the lines is to blame, though), but the film's awesome rock soundtrack sounds terrific.

The extras are pretty much make this release. Three great commentaries which are ALL worth listening to if you are a fan (the third one, featuring Hunter S. Thompson, is particularly interesting), a collection of deleted scenes, and over two hour's worth of featurettes.

Overall, this release comes highly recommended to fans ONLY. If you have never seen this film, I recommend renting it before you pay 20+ dollars for it.

3133006,4,B0014F20GM,"Based on the book and article by the same name, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the movie has been described by the author Hunter S. Thompson as a ""a vile epitaph for the Drug Culture of the Sixties.""
On the surface it may be classified as two individuals on a wild drug trip, but deeper I believe it does delve into the eroding of the American dream.  This venture into what became known as ""Gonzo"" journalism has masterfully been brought to life by actor Johnny Depp who not only transforms into Thompson but also adds his own colorful quirks to relieve this writers journey into the abyss.
Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo, the affable attorney Oscar Acosta who provides the counter to Raul Duke's character and pushes the envelope to the extreme that event makes Hunter seem sane.
A mix of reality meets fiction, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a cult classic from an age that viewing from today's perception seems a whole lot simpler and saner than today's world.
Cameos by a few other well known stars like Carmen Diaz, Bill Murray, and Gary Busey to name a few,  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a wildly wicked peek into the American psyche.  It reaffirms the old maxim that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.",1324857600,,1221,4.490990990990991

3133010,3,B0014F20GM,"This review is not about the movie, but about the BD release. And just in case there are multiple variants of it, my package has bar code 025192046131. I can't remember where I got my copy (not from amazon, that's for sure), but it has the same cover shown here on amazon, and the issues I have with this release are important enough that I thought it would help to write a review here as well.

With this BD experience, I decided I will stay away from future BD acquisitions and stick to purchasing DVDs. Here's why: after a while, this BD will simply stop working. When I got it, I started playing it in a Visio player and all was great. But I couldn't watch it until the end, so I paused it and I adjourned the viewing. Next day, when I wanted to resume it, it wouldn't work - it basically gets stuck after selecting the English language, but before any preview is shown. Screen goes black, no message is shown, skipping or fast forwarding return the encouraging message that the operation is prohibited at the moment (great choice of words that every customer must want to hear, by the way), I can bring up player menus, but I can't change a thing, other than getting back to the player menu. I also have a Sony player, so I thought this might be a Visio player problem, so let me play it in the player of its makers - worked fine again, stopped it, restarted it and continued fine - alas, this was the last time it worked like this - third time I restarted the movie, it got stuck again like on the Visio. Now it doesn't play in either of them. I checked the disc surface and it's perfect - no scratches, dirt, fingerprints. Movie plays initially without any problems in a player, but then it's like it gets stuck and cannot be replayed. Both players I tried it on have the latest respective updates and they're recent models. Other BDs play just fine, so this is a release issue.

Now, this self proclaimed ""perfect hi def movie experience"" has a ""feature"" called BD Live - I think it tries to connect somewhere maybe to get fresh previews (like that's what I purchased this item for) and I suspect that maybe that is what gets stuck. So I tried stopping my internet connection in the hope that it can achieve something - unfortunately it didn't change anything.

I am now looking on the Internet searching for tips on this issue.

The movie is great. Its subject matter may not be to everyone's taste, but that's another thing. I'll probably get it on DVD if I can't figure out a way to make the BD work again.

[UPDATE 10/02/2011]: After digging through player menus, I found a BDLive category on the Visio player which allowed me to delete BDLive content and prohibit Internet access (feels good to be able to prohibit something for a change). On the Sony player, I had no such BDLive menu, but under BD settings I disabled BD Internet Access - I also erased the USB stick just to be sure. After these changes, the disc finally resumed playing in both players. I've been able to complete seeing the movie.

Updating review score - I'll raise it to three stars. A disc shouldn't require changing default player settings to get it to play properly - for the time wasted to fix that problem I am taking two stars out. The issue, in a nutshell, is that if your player has wireless Internet access set up, the disc will stop playing after a while because of some implementation issue with the BDLive feature. The fix is to prevent Internet access (cutting the connection wasn't sufficient, it looks like it must be prohibited using player settings) and clear up all BDLive information stored by the player. Hopefully, this information will save some time to others that encounter this issue.",1317427200,2,3695,4.474777448071217

i also own the t2 ultimate edition.. i bought the version before it(used from disc replay) and had to return it cause of skipping, however, the menu screen from that version i think is the best... its basiclly the same in the ultimate edition, except the machines inthe factory are t1000, not t800...  the detail with the t800, like when it goes into his skull to see the chip (chapter navigation), in my opinion is far superior... lol.  its little things like this that irk me...  although the ultimate edition  version of the film is prolly one of the best dvd releases, along with the rereleases of the origional star wars trilogy... they look damn good for dvd..  however i am pretty much now officially moved on to blu ray, and im deciding how worth it it is to double up on certian movies.. like i did for fear and loathing..  but the caddys, the desert, the lights... the effects, every thing in fear in loathing... gilliams vision, all of that was enough for me to double up on this one.. besides its one of my favorite flicks, and i love hst!! and gilliam is one of my fave directors too...  other faves include david lynch, david cronenberg, christopher nolan(i liked him before batman) spike jonez, michel gondry...david fincher is really good too....

edit:  ive since got the criterion release, which came out a month or so after i purchased this version...  if you like this film, don't settle for anything less than the cc release.. the other version, colors aren't right, and the sound dosnt seem to be mixed properly..  in the begining, with toby ""are you prejeudice? i didn't think so"" when he taps his chest, that sound is completly missing... little small details like that ruin it for me.. i noticed that on my first viewing of the initial release..",1293235200,,2362,4.619617224880383

3366225,1,B0014F20GM,"The movie (""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") is about two drug addicts, one of them is played by Johnny Depp. If I'd see him  in such a movie first time I would not buy any movie with him ever! Look at the picture of DVD title. This is what you going to watch through whole film: bunch of hallucinations through eyes of two losers. I couldn't watch more than half movie because it's sick delirium of ravings of a madman. They under drugs influence all the time, sweating and mumbling, doing some stupid mind disorientated things. And there is so much of that stuff in this movie that you can feel like you gonna through up already. What is this? Is this anti-drug propaganda or drugs Ad?
There are good actors in this movie like Johnny Depp, Cameron Dias (""Mask""), Tobey Maguire (""Spider man""), Craig Bierko (""13th floor"") but it doesn't matter. They are in a gross movie.
Do not buy it unless you want to through away your money.

There was not anything about it that I found particularly memorable, I disliked the characters immensely, it all seemed like an overscripted drama at a nearby theater. This film is considered as a cult classic and yet I happen to be of the cult that doesn't quite dig this. Johnny Depp is one of the most over-rated actors in the industry. I can't help but blame him for how lackluster and robotic his acting made this. I do not recommend this film at all.

The Blu Ray probably has a better detail level so when the actors are tripping on dinosaurs and dim lights, there is better detail to zero in on how boring the film really was. I'm a big White Rabbit fan but they ruined the song in this unfunny roller-coaster.",1277856000,,789,4.26

Thompson remains one of my heroes and this book (sure, movie) is one of the reasons. His consistent efforts to twine his paranoid drug induced smugly-superior-while-completely-overwhelmed schizophrenic behavior with the ""real world"", while showing the real world to be an even weirder parody of his reality, is what made him a great writer and keen observer of the human condition.

It is really quite hard to wrap your head around the crazy situations and amount of substances these two consume in this classic film by Terry Gilliam. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are are such a sight to see in their roles as Hunter S. Thompson and his Attorney Dr. Gonzo (Z). Depp did some in depth role research with Hunter for weeks, including a period of time in Hunter's basement with only headlamps and necessities (supposedly some LSD too) I've heard. Benicio is everything from a raving lunatic to a cool as a cucumber, soft spoken wise man on a good one. They feed off of each other's energy whether it's for the good, the bad, or the ugly. All in all, it is a hilarious, substance soaked adventure that keeps you guessing ""What are they going to do next?"". Hunter S. Thompson was one of the Great Writers of my Generation (29 yrs. Old). He was raw, descriptive and truthful amongst many other things in life and his work. He was also One Hell of an American who Believed in His Constitutional Rights and Freedom, may he R.I.P. .

I understand that several actors were assigned the lead role while the film was in development hell, but the final choice of Depp was a poor one. In this movie he looks like a child--10 to 12 years old--who is playing at being a grownup, which makes his drunken antics even more disturbing.

Our culture has changed, as well, since this mess was made. Regardless of where you stand on gun control, I don't see how anyone could find it funny to watch a completely stoned individual waving guns around. It's hard to believe that such a thing ever WAS funny.

Of course Terry Gilliam's visual style is on display throughout, and that I why I give the movie two stars instead of one. HIs nightmarish visions add some interest to what would otherwise be a complete waste of time.",1454457600,,941,4.562130177514793

3367072,3,B0014F20GM,"What it is: Psychedelia... I guess.

My wife hates this film and cannot understand why I would ever watch it.

This movie should be seen for it credentials if for nothing else, but you might just hate yourself on the morning: Hunter S. Thompson (the movie is narrated from start to end with his copy,) Alex Cox (of Repo Man (1984) fame,) & Terry Gilliam (who picked it up after Cox.) It does feature some trippy scenes, melting faces and fabrics, lizard people (with what I would guess is a returning, unexplained prop when Johnny Depp shows up with a lizard tail later on,) and lots of general weirdness and bizarre people and behavior, if no other actual genre content.

What story there is: Hunter and his sidekick go Las Vegas to cover a desert race, demolish their hotel room, attempt to leave, then return on a different assignment to cover a D.A. conference and proceed to trash a second hotel room. All the while they mass consume vast quantities of illegal chemicals and appear not to cover anything, really.

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not so much a story as a drug addled road trip to Vegas and back again. It is hard to see what the intent of filming this other than generating a general feeling of disgust (lots of vomit scenes, for some reason or other*.)  The movie is set five years or so after the height of Haight-Ashbury hippiedom (at least according to Thompson.) The Summer of Love is well over by now, and while it is at this point hard to really identify what Hunter S. had to do really with teenaged hippies in San Francisco, he claims to have been there at the time and he seems to understand that whatever happened there is now dead.

Distorted lenses, tilted cameras and light CG (just before the disastrously incompetent CG of the Brothers Grimm movie and the later explosive, Pythonish CG of Parnassus.) The neon Vegas setting adds to the trippy ambiance, and it may well be that the actual point of the movie is simply to recreate a cinematic drug trip.

I would call if a head movie if not for the fact that there could not possibly be any cosmic significance in any of it.

*But which, frankly, after the Python excesses of Mr. Creosote or the behind the scenes secrets of Crunchy Frog, may very well have only a mild effect.",1446422400,,2264,4.4914841849148415

3367136,5,B0014F20GM,"It was once said that the Austrian composer Wolfgang Mozart was ""not a man of this world."" If that was true of Mozart, then Hunter S. Thompson, the original Gonzo journalist, was not a man of this Universe, or any other for that matter. Or maybe, when Thompson came into this universe, he accidentally brought the other one with him. Thompson, the writer of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, was a man whose perspective on life oozed from a pen filled with ink from other dimensions.

Thompson made a following in the 1960's and 1970's with a two-fold avant-garde approach to journalism. Well, ""avant-garde "" is almost too tame a word. His style was the journalistic equivalent to Salvadore Dali or Thomas Pynchon where reality and surrealism become very reluctant bedfellows in a world that seems to have gone mad--or maybe it never really was sane to begin with. The other aspect in addition to Thompson's warped view of the world is his habit of engaging in the lovingly coined term ""Gonzo Journalism"". For those unfamiliar with it, Gonzo Journalism refers to an approach to reporting in which the reporter and/or journalist becomes as important to (or more important than) the story itself, in a kind of self-aggrandizement in which the story and reporter literally become one. And Thompson was, for almost five decades, the quintessential Gonzo journalist. He is sometimes referred to as Dr Gonzo.

As Gonzo journalism is definitely not for all readers, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is definitely not for all movie-goers. If you're shopping for a film to re-affirm certain steadfast precepts of logic, love, ethics, and morality, then your movie-buying dollar needs to be invested elsewhere. But if you're willing to forgo any predetermined expectations about how and what a movie should be, you're in for one hell of a ride. Fear and Loathing is a roller coaster from which you never seem to be able to get off.

The story surrounds a semi-fictional character, Raoul Duke, played brilliantly by Johnny Depp in a role that even the most daring of actors would avoid at all costs. The only other actor brave or foolish enough to step into the twisted world of Thompson was Bill Murray in ""Where the Buffalo Roam"". The difference between Raoul Duke and Hunter Thompson is mainly the spelling. The character is still replete with Thompson's trademark long cigarette, California drawl, and a personality that is at once maddeningly low-key and as deranged as Dracula on speed. The Raoul Duke aka Hunter Thompson character is the type of person you might want to at first avoid by running into the nearest coat closet before peeking your head out to see what this space alien masquerading as a human being will do next. And Raoul Duke goes on this adventure with a side-kick known sometimes as his attorney and also as Dr Gonzo.

The setting for the misadventures of these two interplanetary refugees couldn't be more perfect. Space Alien and his side-kick Godzilla go on a drug-infested trip to the loony-bin surreal capital of the US of A: Las Vegas. Duke is supposed to be covering a motorcycle race for the incomparable Sports Illustrated and gets sidetracked by the amusement park that is the Disneyland for adults. The road trip begins on the infamous two-lane highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in a 1960's convertible that has seen better days--and better owners. Even before they arrive in neon-ville, Depp sees bats all over the sky, but becomes concerned when his partner fails to see them also. He wonders that his partner may be ""losing it"" when he doesn't see the bats that Depp does. During the trip (and the ""trip"") these two maniacs enter Vegas and see strange creatures in and out of hotels, casinos, bars, and even on the race track. And people in particular sometimes show up as reptilian creatures looking to devour Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo.

The result is a kind of endless romp through an amusement park from Hell that never lets up. At one point the drugs have so twisted all of their perceptions of reality that the world has become somewhat akin to the hideout of the Joker in the old Batman TV series from the 1960's, you know where the floor is always slanted to the side. This is the Hunter Thompson world to a tee faithfully executed by probably the only other entity on the planet twisted enough himself to bring this mayhem to the screen: Terry Guilliam of Monty Python fame. (He was the originator of the mad cartoons that combined European Renaissance art with the Python surrealist sensibility between sketches.) The story is a mosaic of drug-inducements that nearly drive the characters insane. I mean, is Las Vegas only the most inane choice of a location to engage in an intense drug-fest? Some have criticized this movie as advocating and glorifying psychedelic drugs, but I disagree. By movie's end I felt there was a reason I don't personally engage in these kinds of ""trips"". Maybe the world is mad enough as it is without using artificial means to make it seem even more insane.",1430870400,,5027,4.793540945790081

3367145,2,B0014F20GM,"The beginning of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (a.k.a. What Its Like to Be Perpetually High in Nevada) is akin to the ending of Psycho: though youve heard its catchphrase before, it feels fresh when you sit down to watch.  When Norman Bates says in his mothers voice that he wouldnt hurt a fly, our skin crawls, whereas in Fear and Loathing, Johnny Depps delivery of We cant stop here; this is bat country is positively hilarious.  Context is key, and we know from the opening credits of Fear and Loathing that were in for a wild ride by literally starting off in one.

I normally don't like films that are one big acid trip (or, in this case, acid, mescaline, weed, ether, etc.), and Fear and Loathing is no exception.  Though, Depps portrayal of late author Hunter S. Thompson is all too entertaining, even if he does become a caricature at times.  I could have watched Depp swat at imaginary bats in that car for hours.

Fear and Loathings plot relies heavily on the audience having a prior understanding of who Hunter S. Thompson was and what he did for a living, else you're left wondering why this middle-aged dude and his lawyer are spending so much time in Vegas, blitzed out of their skulls.

We don't get a grasp on Raoul Dukes (Thompsons alter-ego, as we learn in a great scene involving a parking lot attendant) being a member of the press, covering a race in Vegas, until were about a quarter of the way in, when Duke contemplates via voice-over: What was the meaning of this trip? Was I just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind? Or had I really come out here to Las Vegas to work on a story? Your guess is as good as ours, Duke.

I thought Dr. Gonzos (Benicio Del Toro) being an attorney was a joke.  Surely, an attorney would keep more of a level head when he has a client like Duke, but no, the seduction of the drugs was apparently too great.  Scarily enough, when Gonzo is sober, Del Toro is actually somewhat comprehensible.  (I swear, the dude is like a Puerto Rican Marlon Brando.)

Fear and Loathing is as littered with celebrities as the Vegas strip itself, with quick cameos from the likes of Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, Flea, and Gary Busey, Ellen Barkin, Mark Harmon, Harry Dean Stanton, Penn Jillette, Christina Ricci, and even Verne Troyer (remember him?).  And yes, when Duke sees a future version of himself in a tripped-out haze, that is indeed Thompson, making an uncredited cameo appearance as himself.

Whats interesting is that all of these stars are credited with such bland character titles as Hitchhiker (Maguire), Magazine Reporter (Harmon), or Highway Patrolman (Busey)  a character who clearly has a name, as is indicated by his badge.  This suggests to me that when you're as saturated in drugs as Duke is, and for as long as he is, people lack significance.  Unless, of course, other people being insignificant had nothing to do with the drugs at all.

But the drugs, oh, those are referred to by name of course, and often.  Duke explains nearly every drug they take while they're taking it and the experience that each one brings, hallucinating images of blood-soaked floors and stretched out faces.  Fear and Loathing is as much a love letter to drugs as it is to Nevada (though, I must admit, Im sold on that carousel bar).

One thing that can be said about Depp is that the man surely loves his job, so much so that he makes you want to be an actor, too.  Im willing to bet that this is why he tends to veer toward crazier characters.  Despite the fact that he embodies these roles so perfectly, though, you can always tell that its still Depp under the make-up.  He never loses himself so completely as, say, Tim Robbins did in The Shawshank Redemption  save for maybe his portrayal of Sweeney Todd.

I remember reading that during the filming of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Depps daughter came down with a serious E. Coli-related illness, which no doubt influenced his work, allowing him to bring an exceptional brand of darkness to the role in a performance that ultimately earned him an Oscar nod.  So he didn't win  I doubt he minded.  Depp seems like the kind of person thats grateful to be able to wake up every day and do what he does; an Oscar win would probably be nothing more than a cherry atop an already fulfilling cake.

I remember learning in film class once upon a time that the voice-over technique can be frowned upon, as it is often overused as a lazy method of exposition, rather than the showing, not telling that film is supposed to accomplish.  (Thats why they call them moving pictures.)  Voice-over is rarely done well, though I imagine that its easier to execute it properly when adapting the film from a book, since the material basically writes itself.  What a way to sell a novel.",1426636800,,4788,4.549591598599767

3367242,5,B0014F20GM,"This movie is one of those works of art, kind of like a Tool album, that the casual movie-watcher can dismiss but those of us that get it, treasure it.  The acting is off the charts.  Depp aside, Benecio delivers one of the most powerful, hilarious, intimidating and sickening performances I've ever seen on film.  His scene with Ellen Barkin is as tense as scene as you'd see in any straight-laced drama.  His scene on the rotating bar at Circus Circus is as funny as anything you'd find in a mainstream comedy.  And it goes on and on, scene after scene, a new level of the character acting anywhere from responsible to outright homicidal.  It's something to behold.

The dialogue is wonderful.  It plays like jazz.  On re-watching it I always pick up on a different riff I missed the last time.  An it's infinitely quotable if that's your thing.  ""There he goes -- one of God's own prototypes -- a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production.""

The soundtrack is masterful and perfectly complements the material.  The visual effects and camera work are also perfect for the material.  The sets and details from the vomit on the walls to Tobey Maguires t-shirt are all genius.

It's a masterful work.  I'm almost glad it wasn't a hit when it came out and that the critic's didn't like it.  It makes it feel like I generally do about most things, that the majority of people just don't get it.  But if you've never seen it, please give it a couple watches as with any great piece of art be it a book, painting, song or movie, it deserves more than one look.  ""Don't try and fight it, or you'll get brain bubbles.  Strokes, aneurysms.  You'll just wither up and die.""",1414713600,,1697,4.516447368421052

Sure, there are plenty of drugs in the book, but also commentary on the ""American Dream"" and a good deal of humor and insight. None of that is in the movie and you might as well skip the second half--it's just more of the same.

He was appalled by it and we left half way through. Recently I bought the movie and watched it with out the assistance of someone with narrow views and a jaundiced sense of judgment.
I was blown away by all the performances and had not realized first time around what a star studded cast this was !! With Toby McGuire, Christina Ricci and Cameron Diaz supporting Depp and Del Torro this film was pure genius. Shock value, outrageous humor and total extravaganza. Depp as Hunter Thompson was in his element. Anyone with a sense of humor who was alive in the 70's needs to see this film. If you were alive in the 70's and you don't dig this movie, well, then it's unlikely you were really alive in the 70's.",1389744000,5,854,4.181818181818182

3367370,4,B0014F20GM,"From the very beginning, Terry Gilliam is able to make you want to squirm in your seat from a mix of feeling uncomfortable, laughter, and fear. This might sound like a criticism, but it's actually not. It is the mark of a very well-made movie that succeeds in its goal. The movie chronicles two 'businessmen' who get wasted out of their minds and destroy their lives in Las Vegas, comically and disgustingly. As a commentary of drug culture gone wrong, it might make you never want to ever go near drugs entirely. The slow decay of their sanity is depicted through an interesting blend of cinematography and content, and Terry Gilliam really pulls out the big guns with his absurdist style and knack for the bizarre (circus performing wolverines and martini-drinking lizard people, anyone?) It's not Depp's best performance, but Del Toro is extremely scary in this film, showcasing a powerful performance. Interesting watch if you're looking for something strange and intellectually stimulating.",1376870400,2,995,5.110429447852761

3367473,3,B0014F20GM,"This film depicts an out-of-control drug-induced orgy of destruction and idiocy. That doesn't mean the film is bad, it is just that it is about 150 minutes of chaos that is almost exhausting to observe and virtually impossible to comprehend fully. The film left me with the question: Why would two educated adult men embark upon a drug eating disaster in which their safety is constantly in jeopardy? There are probably many reasons but primarily, the change of human consciousness is positively reinforcing, that the distortion of perception is highly entertaining, and that the bending and melting of reality is a statement of rebellion against the system but also against the futility of trying to live a good productive life in a world of hypocrisy and idiots. The film shows men taking drugs that distort all perception, which they find extremely entertaining, far more than television. This distortion makes them feel good in the wildest, dangerous, hedonistic manner. They lose their humanity. The film actually starts with a quotation from Dr. Samuel Johnson to the effect that men become beasts to escape the pain of being human. This was more than a witty opening to the film, it is actually the meaning of the entire production. The film could be taken at many levels but many folks will be highly entertained by the outlandish foolishness that these drug intoxicated fellows create around them. It is entertaining and I found it kept me absorbed, shaking my head in disbelief, for over 2 hours. But underneath the foolishness, what was being said?  I think it was saying that human existence is not a bed of roses for we are confronted with death, loss, illness, violence, boredom, and a host of other barriers and burdens. We also are fully aware of these pains, for the most part. Yet we have an escape, the escape of changes to our consciousness that makes it all go away and get replaced by another reality and this wild reality is in place until we come back down to our senses and land back into the world of the living. So was this really a film about existentialism?  Only if you are an existentialist.

The image is amazing (whether you care for the movie or not, you HAVE to admit that it's a marvel of set design and special effects), and the audio is very good. Some of the dialogue is hard to understand at times (the fact that the actors mumble many of the lines is to blame, though), but the film's awesome rock soundtrack sounds terrific.

The extras are pretty much make this release. Three great commentaries which are ALL worth listening to if you are a fan (the third one, featuring Hunter S. Thompson, is particularly interesting), a collection of deleted scenes, and over two hour's worth of featurettes.

Overall, this release comes highly recommended to fans ONLY. If you have never seen this film, I recommend renting it before you pay 20+ dollars for it.

3367503,4,B0014F20GM,"Based on the book and article by the same name, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the movie has been described by the author Hunter S. Thompson as a ""a vile epitaph for the Drug Culture of the Sixties.""
On the surface it may be classified as two individuals on a wild drug trip, but deeper I believe it does delve into the eroding of the American dream.  This venture into what became known as ""Gonzo"" journalism has masterfully been brought to life by actor Johnny Depp who not only transforms into Thompson but also adds his own colorful quirks to relieve this writers journey into the abyss.
Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo, the affable attorney Oscar Acosta who provides the counter to Raul Duke's character and pushes the envelope to the extreme that event makes Hunter seem sane.
A mix of reality meets fiction, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a cult classic from an age that viewing from today's perception seems a whole lot simpler and saner than today's world.
Cameos by a few other well known stars like Carmen Diaz, Bill Murray, and Gary Busey to name a few,  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a wildly wicked peek into the American psyche.  It reaffirms the old maxim that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.",1324857600,,1221,4.490990990990991

3367507,3,B0014F20GM,"This review is not about the movie, but about the BD release. And just in case there are multiple variants of it, my package has bar code 025192046131. I can't remember where I got my copy (not from amazon, that's for sure), but it has the same cover shown here on amazon, and the issues I have with this release are important enough that I thought it would help to write a review here as well.

With this BD experience, I decided I will stay away from future BD acquisitions and stick to purchasing DVDs. Here's why: after a while, this BD will simply stop working. When I got it, I started playing it in a Visio player and all was great. But I couldn't watch it until the end, so I paused it and I adjourned the viewing. Next day, when I wanted to resume it, it wouldn't work - it basically gets stuck after selecting the English language, but before any preview is shown. Screen goes black, no message is shown, skipping or fast forwarding return the encouraging message that the operation is prohibited at the moment (great choice of words that every customer must want to hear, by the way), I can bring up player menus, but I can't change a thing, other than getting back to the player menu. I also have a Sony player, so I thought this might be a Visio player problem, so let me play it in the player of its makers - worked fine again, stopped it, restarted it and continued fine - alas, this was the last time it worked like this - third time I restarted the movie, it got stuck again like on the Visio. Now it doesn't play in either of them. I checked the disc surface and it's perfect - no scratches, dirt, fingerprints. Movie plays initially without any problems in a player, but then it's like it gets stuck and cannot be replayed. Both players I tried it on have the latest respective updates and they're recent models. Other BDs play just fine, so this is a release issue.

Now, this self proclaimed ""perfect hi def movie experience"" has a ""feature"" called BD Live - I think it tries to connect somewhere maybe to get fresh previews (like that's what I purchased this item for) and I suspect that maybe that is what gets stuck. So I tried stopping my internet connection in the hope that it can achieve something - unfortunately it didn't change anything.

I am now looking on the Internet searching for tips on this issue.

The movie is great. Its subject matter may not be to everyone's taste, but that's another thing. I'll probably get it on DVD if I can't figure out a way to make the BD work again.

[UPDATE 10/02/2011]: After digging through player menus, I found a BDLive category on the Visio player which allowed me to delete BDLive content and prohibit Internet access (feels good to be able to prohibit something for a change). On the Sony player, I had no such BDLive menu, but under BD settings I disabled BD Internet Access - I also erased the USB stick just to be sure. After these changes, the disc finally resumed playing in both players. I've been able to complete seeing the movie.

Updating review score - I'll raise it to three stars. A disc shouldn't require changing default player settings to get it to play properly - for the time wasted to fix that problem I am taking two stars out. The issue, in a nutshell, is that if your player has wireless Internet access set up, the disc will stop playing after a while because of some implementation issue with the BDLive feature. The fix is to prevent Internet access (cutting the connection wasn't sufficient, it looks like it must be prohibited using player settings) and clear up all BDLive information stored by the player. Hopefully, this information will save some time to others that encounter this issue.",1317427200,2,3695,4.474777448071217

8255551,4,B0014F20GM,"Loved the highly-subjective story, action and even the acting by Depp and co-star. Also appreciated the wise inner distance from the hippy culture this film displays, even though I kind of respect hippy culture philosophically. Hated the stupid cheesey athiest pseudo-philosophy tacked on at the end. Gonzo was a journalist extradinaire, but not much of a philosopher. Ultimately, this is a film you will either hate or love, and I mostly loved it.",1523750400,,448,5.1506849315068495
