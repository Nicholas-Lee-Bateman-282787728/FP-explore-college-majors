7374454,5,B013XBC9Y2,Greatest Japanese gangster films in an amazing set. Probably some of the best films ever made as well. Don't waste time and buy this set now before it's too late. Trust me.,1448496000,7,172,4.40625
7374455,5,B013XBC9Y2,"Here we finally have a Blu Ray box set of Battles without Honor and Humanity (AKA The Yakuza Papers) by director Kinji Fukasaku. Like the description says these films are sort of the Japanese equivalent of The Godfather. Difference being these are more violent & a lot of different characters come & go frequently sometimes. This set includes the original 5 films in the series plus extras:
Battles without Honor and Humanity
Battles without Honor and Humanity: Deadly Fight in Hiroshima
Battles without Honor and Humanity: Proxy War
Battles without Honor and Humanity: Police Tactics
Battles without Honor and Humanity: Final Episode
And exclusive to this limited edition set is Battles without Honor and Humanity: The Complete Saga which is a condensed version of the first 4  movies into one film & has never been seen outside of Japan. Set also include The Yakuza Papers book which has writings on the movies, Yakuza films in general & other things. Bonus features on the movie discs include interviews, commentaries, trailers & galleries. Two particular features I really like are on the first movie disc, an interview with Japanese director Takashi Miike & on the 4th movie disc which is a featurette called Remembering Kinji that talks about the late, great directors work.

Those familiar with Arrow Video know they release some great box sets & this one is no different. The films look really good, the extras are also good for those that are not only fans of the series but also fans of Yakuza films as a whole. One of the films stars is Bunta Sugawara who plays Shozo an ex soldier who kills someone, gets sent to jail, things happen while he's inside, then he's released, joins the Yakuza & more things happen (im trying to not spoil the overall story of what exactly happens for those that haven't seen it). There are also other characters that the films follow. The second film mostly follows the story of Shoji Yamanaka (played by Kinya Kitaoji) & also has Sonny Chiba & Meiko Kaji (from Lady Snowblood) in it. Films 3-5 return to mostly following original main character Shozo Hirono (Bunta Sugawara) as he deals with trouble both from inside & outside his Yakuza family. The films follow a timeline from 1946 to about the 1970s. Anyway, these films are really great, action packed Yakuza films. Very gritty feel to them as well. The only issue some may have is all the characters that are always being introduced or leave without notice (there's sometimes a lot going on in these films) but that's a really minor issue. If you are a fan of Asian action films or Yakuza films then this great looking set is a must own, the films are really good. This is one of the few times I can say I enjoyed every film in a box set.

And if you enjoy the 5 movies in this set there are more films in the series you may also want to check out that are not included here:
New Battles without Honor and Humanity
New Battles without Honor and Humanity: The Boss's Head
New Battles without Honor and Humanity: The Boss's Last Days
Aftermath of Battles without Honor and Humanity
Another Battle
Another Battle: Conspiracy
Hopefully Arrow also put out another box set with those other Battles films. And you can also check out some of Kinji Fukasaku's other Yakuza films as well. All fans of Yakuza films owe it to themselves to grab this wonderful limited set while its available. If you happen to miss out on this set though (limited to only 2500) Arrow said individual releases of the films would come sometime next year.",1448236800,23,3520,4.692556634304207

8729109,4,B013XBC9Y2,"Interesting series of Japanese gangster movies from the mid 70s. I would think this is what the US mafia in the early 30s would have been like too. A lot of gangsters, in a desperate environment, plotting and killing. One point, as a car guy. Don't say its 1950 and then immediatley have one of the main guys drive a 57 chevy! And keep driving it through the whole movie! I can understand seeing a 1972 Datsun in the city traffic, but I would think you would want the only main car to be correct. OK, said my piece. Will watch them all!",1515369600,,536,4.213592233009709

8729113,5,B013XBC9Y2,"These are very entertaining films.  They describe the history of the Yakuza in Japan from the immediate post-war period to their present (1973-74) by focussing on the careers of a handful of individuals operating in Hiroshima. I have seen these films compared to the Godfather films (the first two anyway), which were released at about the same time.  They are not as polished and operatic as the Godfather films, but like the Godfather films, they do benefit from the presence of many interesting characters and situations.  These movies reminded me more of The Velachi Papers in terms of production values, tone and style.  This is not a bad thing in my eyes, as that film is also an entertaining look at the development of organized crime seen through the examination of one man's career.  The films are a lot of fun to watch and seeing the development of the characters from era to era was fun.  The image quality and sound quality on the discs is very good.  The supplemental materials are also very interesting and the packaging is also well done and solid. No cardboard sleeves etc. here (I'm looking at you Marvel :))",1454544000,4,1125,4.7384615384615385
8729114,5,B013XBC9Y2,"If you don't already have these films stop reading now and buy this set, they are some of the best movies every made period and this is currently the only release offering them. Because these are must-owns I'm not gonna review the films; other people have done that and I just watched the Home Vision Entertainment DVD box set a couple months before I found out about this and wasn't gonna watch them again so soon (Although I did watch the ""Complete Saga"" cut that combines the first four films together). Instead I'll focus on what this Arrow set has compared to the HVE set released over ten years ago. I'm not a filmophile in the sense of being able to discuss technical aspects of the transfer and video quality, so it will be in layman terms.

First, upon buying this set you must immediately flip the slip covers over to the original poster artwork, the newly commissioned artwork is atrocious. The hardcover book is probably the best you could ask for and far above the little booklet from the HVE set. However, I'll note that as I am obsessed with yakuza films a good chunk wasn't new to me as a lot of it can be found online and I already had the book where the Fukusaku interview was first published. The ""behind the scenes"" article written by screenwriter Kasahara before the fourth film was even released is amazing and the clear highlight of the entire set, thank you Arrow for translating it. The history of Toei was a nice little addition too. I found the family tree of the film's characters a mess and don't think it will be much help to first time viewers; the foldout pamphlet of the tree given by HVE was better.

The Takeshi Miike interview is useless, but the interviews with the series' stunt coordinator, actor Seizo Fukumoto, episodes 3 & 4 assistant director, and episode 5 screenwriter were all good. ""Remembering Kinji"" with film scholar Yamane and the director's son Kenta is nice to learn stuff about Fukasaku's filmmaking and about the relationship with his son, who is also a director. The mini-doc on the Piranha Corps, a group of lesser known actors and drinking buddies who each appear in the films as several different characters, is the highlight as far as I'm concerned. The HVE extras have an interview with Kenta that just very briefly mentioned that Piranha name and I wanted to learn more ever since. Special feature wise this set beats the HVE one by its quantity, although HVE did have three good ones on Fukasaku's filmmaking, his use of violence, and the Jitsuroku subgenre.

As I said above I haven't watch the individual films yet, but did watch the Complete Saga edit. Do not throw it in thinking you can get the same experience and save time, these films can not be edited together and still make sense, especially to first time viewers. The Complete Saga was just an obvious cash grab from Toei and should only appeal to collectors. I've also skipped through the individual blu-rays and can say that to me, they are clearer/sharper than the HVE DVDs and have less grain, but they seem a little too dark.

The DVD/Blu-ray dual format is something that baffles me, just a reason to jack the price up. But hey, right now Amazon has this set for like five dollars cheaper than the DVD-only HVE set was originally. The HVE set is actually going for good prices on Ebay now. I believe I heard that Arrow might release the five films individually without the special features in which case you might want to get them that way if its cheaper, but then again if that doesn't happen you're missing out on superb films.",1454198400,5,3560,4.601574803149607
8729115,2,B013XBC9Y2,"This review isn't for the actual Battles films as they are all stellar examples of the Yakuza genre, if not THE most quintessential Yakuza films ever shot.  The films get 5 stars easily!!!  This review is for Arrow's shoddy film transfers.  While some of Arrow's Blu-ray transfers are gorgeous, others are very meh (I've found this to be the case with more of their Japanese releases).  It's kind of a gamble.  I only wish Criterion had acquired the U.S. rights to these films... then they would've looked a whole hell of a lot sharper.  The video presentation on this set is mediocre at best.  Upon first viewing, I honestly thought I had put the DVD from the set into my player by accident instead of the Blu-ray.  There's really no telling the difference from the old HVE DVD box set as far as the films transfers are concerned (maybe the slightest bit, but nothing worth Arrow's tremendous asking price).  One can clearly tell that these transfers were sourced from dated masters.  The colors are all washed out.  Even reds don't pop for s**t.  Blacks are a sickly grey, far from inky.  Contrast is lackluster.  The picture is on the hazy side of things, not sharp at all (though in all fairness this could be a factor of the source material).  In any case, there's next to NO fine detail to be found.  Granted, I have only made it through the first 3 films in the set, but if they are indicative of the other two then I must say that this box set is a serious let down where transfers are concerned.

That said, if you don't already own the prior HVE steel case DVD set then this release is still worth picking up.  As I said before, the films themselves are second to none, no frills, balls to the wall Yakuza masterworks.  But if you already own the previous HVE set as I did and are considering the pricey upgrade for this new Arrow set, just know that you'll barely see a difference in picture quality.  You'll also be losing a ton of home storage space as the new Arrow set is a real beast in size (another area where Criterion kills Arrow is in smart packaging).

On the upside, this new Arrow release comes with a very insightful booklet on the Battles series and Fukasaku himself, as well as new interviews and extras not previously available on the old HVE set.  But if you're like me, the main drawing point for Blu-ray is picture quality and everything else is secondary.  That being the case, this new set just doesn't cut the pinky finger.",1451865600,23,2457,4.47191011235955
8729116,5,B013XBC9Y2,Best blind buy of the year.  I'd compare it to Goodfellas.  Arrow has released a great box set and the transfers look great.,1451606400,2,124,4.3478260869565215
