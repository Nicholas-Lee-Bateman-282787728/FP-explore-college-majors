6284893,5,B00IPL29ZK,Outstanding conversion to DVD.  And what an incredible opportunity to see the USS Arizona just a few years (1934)  before December 7.  I have been told that a number of sailors lost on Dec 7 are extras in this picture. The details in the movie are also terrific resources for model enthusiasts who like to detail their work.  I much prefer this era and detail to the very controversial model newly installed at Pearl that is very dark blue and has the turret tops painted red.  Nothing I've seen and no commentary by even the salvage teams make any mention or show colored turret tops on ANY ship in Pearl on Dec 7.,1411171200,7,615,4.407079646017699

6284895,5,B00IPL29ZK,An extraordinary movie in that almost all of it was actually shot on location aboard the battleship USS Arizona! An extraordinary movie for any fan of 1930s movies and history buffs.,1406246400,3,182,4.903225806451613
6284896,5,B00IPL29ZK,If your a fan of early James Cagney then I would suggest  this movie. It features Cagney and his buddies Pat O'Brien and Frank Mc Hugh in the navy in 1934.,1405209600,3,155,4.0
6284897,4,B00IPL29ZK,"Great shots of the Arizona, the only movie ever shot on this iconic ship.  Paul Stilwell, the author of the Battleship Arizona, devoted an entire chapter to the shooting of this movie on the ship.  If you are a modeller, or just an interested observer, it is a movie well worth watching.  Story isn't that bad either, typical 30's military stuff.",1404691200,11,346,4.639344262295082
6284898,5,B00IPL29ZK,"Good transfer with clear picture and good sound.  Storyline is good with good photos of the USS Arizona throughout the movie..  I have been looking for this film for a long time.  The last time i saw it was a VHS transfer which was lousy. Different roll for Cagney, but still the bullheaded tough guy. Good flick.",1402876800,5,313,4.456140350877193

6284904,5,B00IPL29ZK,"Absolutely see this movie! I bought this movie on the advice of an aviation historian/author I know for a Navy Veteran friend. We showed the movie at a meeting of Pearl Harbor Survivors San Diego Chapter (thankfully there really are some left!) and a bunch of club friends who support this group and socialize at a small museum here. They loved it. The old time plot with the cocky insubordinate guy (Cagney) who acts the jerk then turns out OK and his nemesis (Pat O'Brien) the true Navy Blue guy was like so many of that age but we all were hooting and hollering for them. The biggest attraction for these men was the fact that it was filmed among other places here in San Diego at the Naval Training Center and on board the U.S.S. Arizona. The deep feelings for the Arizona made it extra nice to she her in her prime and all the scenes on board and real war game footage added were eagerly viewed and commented on. The U.S.S. Macon also makes an appearance. She had been moored in San Diego for a time also. They loved the training scenes declaring them to be exactly as they remembered and some even were at NTC San Diego before being deployed to the Pacific. It was a really great experience and I wound up offering to order 4 more copies from Amazon for the guys who wanted their own copy and don't have computers to order. If you know any ""old"" Navy vets or really enjoy these old time uncomplicated plot movies this is one to see. Anchors Aweigh!",1444435200,6,1454,4.369003690036901

6284908,5,B00IPL29ZK,"A nice nostalgic movie, with a little bit history from the Mid Thirties about how the US Navy was working, when her heavy renovated old WWI battleships yet were the strong components of the fleet during Pacific fleet manoevres, westwards from San Diego.
You can see the battleship USS Arizona alive!. (sadly, devasted by the Japanese air raid at Pearl Harbor, where the sunken wrecked hull now is a Memorial site!) also the supporting airships and seaplanes at that time. (a perfect working long range Naval Airwings, like nowadays, didn't exist)
 For saillors who have been realy known the USS Arizona, surely, this movie is a nostagic memory.",1436400000,,644,4.962962962962963
6284909,5,B00IPL29ZK,"One of James Cagney's lesser known movies, but one I loved. One of the big reasons I enjoyed it was the stars not listed in the movie - the Naval Training Center in San Diego, the rigid airship USS Macon, and the battleship USS Arizona!

Great fun from the 1930s!",1435190400,2,263,4.26
6284910,5,B00IPL29ZK,"My wife's father was the son of a Corpus Christie TX pool hall owner hard hit by the Great Depression. When he came of age (actually a wee bit before) he couldn't wait to get the hell out, and joined the U.S. Navy to see the world. In 1941. After boot camp in San Diego, he was assigned to the Pacific Fleet Battleship Arizona stationed at Pearl Harbor in not yet state of Hawaii in August, where he enjoyed the frequently janitorial tasks of a Seaman Second Class, and the delights of Honolulu... until Battle Stations were called the morning of December 7th. His was luckily situated at the top of the rear observation tower, a random or providence chosen spot that nearly everything fore of was blown up when a Japanese bomb hit a main powder magazine. Oree C. Weller and just under 300 guys lived to get their names on the ""Survivors"" list of the Memorial that straddles the ship now.

Here Comes The Navy was filmed just a few years earlier on board the Arizona, and gives us rare insight to what life on board was like before the ship became the starting point of WWII for the America. Glad this film is finally available. The rights were held by Turner Classic Movies, and after Ted sold it, they sat on it for years, ignoring the repeated requests of WWII historians, enthusiasts, and battleship fans. For us...well Jimmy Cagney hangs his hammock much like Oree did. We'll be screening this every December 7th and toasting him with Navy Rum or something. He'd like that.",1434672000,8,1478,4.535580524344569
6284911,4,B00IPL29ZK,"Oh, Jimmy!  Too funny!  But, another record of America between the wars, and everyday glimpses of what was then.  Including poor Arizona!  Worth watching for the ships and lighter than air ships that are long gone.  Not to mention the attitudes of the times that are also long gone!",1431648000,,282,4.673469387755102

6284915,4,B00IPL29ZK,Typical Warner Brothers formula. Cagney is the diamond in the rough and O'Brien has to teach him to be a team player. It helps that Cagney falls for O'Brien's sister Gloria Stuart (Titanic).,1419724800,,190,4.787878787878788

8644489,5,B00IPL29ZK,"This movie is steeped in pre-WWII history.  Some shameful (the way African Americans were treated), and much notable.  The Naval Training Base at San Diego, The USS Arizona and the USS Macon all seen in action.  Plus footage of the USN's first generation aircraft carriers, the Lexington and Saratoga is seen.  If you or a loved one was a participant in WWII, it is a must see.  Finally, James Cagney's love interest and Pat O'Brien's sister in the movie is none other than Gloria Stuart - she played Rose in the 1997 movie Titanic. Amazing to have roles over 60 years apart.

This film, ""Action in the North Atlantic"" and ""Battle Stations"" (a badly acted but historically significant movie about the USS Franklin ((which was rescued by my dad's light cruiser the USS Santa Fe)) are my all time favorite US Navy movies.",1522281600,,819,4.6923076923076925

8644496,4,B00IPL29ZK,"I loved this film, don't miss this as it has both comedy and drama.

 If you are a history buff, then you should note that it was filmed aboard the USS Arizona and the USS Macon.  Both Navy ships that were lost.  The Arizona in the Pearl Harbor attack and the USS Macon in an accident.

This is the first film that pares James Cagney and Pat O'Brien who went on to make a number of pictures together. (Angels with Dirty Faces and the Fighting 69th just to name a couple).  It's a picture that takes you back to a simpler time and also has the 30s slang in the picture.  Gloria Stewart, who plays the main female part is the lady who won the Oscar for the movie Titanic.",1474848000,,669,4.1
8644497,3,B00IPL29ZK,"It's okay. Corny story line by today's standards, but entertaining. The best part is actually seeing the USS Arizona in a different way than the Pearl Harbor raid. The Airship Macon was quite a site also.",1470268800,,204,4.694444444444445
