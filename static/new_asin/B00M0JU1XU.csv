I can't believe this won't become a Christmas classic.  The story was very interesting, and Susan's singing of the title song was wonderful.  Don't miss this one.",1408579200,45,321,4.642857142857143

Especially enjoyed seeing Susan Boyle in her first film role and hearing her exquisite voice singing an original song Miracle Hymn.
This is a film the whole family can enjoy every Christmas and should become a Christmas classic.  On the dvd cover it states ""includes Susan Boyle's 1st US live performance of 'Miracle Hymn' "", a wonderful video to watch over and over.",1408579200,64,450,4.8311688311688314

6530457,5,B00M0JU1XU,"""If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."" ~ Jesus, Matthew 21:22

""The Christmas Candle"" is a movie that captures the hope and miracles of Christmas. This is a story about the power of faith and belief. The plot is simple but has a few unexpected twists and turns. The basic story is that every 25 years an angel blesses a candle. When that candle is given to someone in need and they light it, their prayer is answered. The only problem is the candles all get mixed up in an accident so no one knows which candle was blessed. That means some unexpected things are going to happen.

It was delightful to see Susan Boyle singing in this movie. It was also meaningful to see a skeptical minister believe in miracles again. So if you are looking for a wonderful Christmas movie I can't recommend this highly enough. It is a beautiful story and has a magical ending.

For me that is a HUGE turn off and actually ruined what would have been a nice movie.  The movie has many important messages.  Let it speak for itself!  I will not watch the movie again simply because I refuse to be force fed propaganda and the people who made the DVD programmed it so you can't just get past it to see the movie.  How sad!

The message of forgiveness and salvation by God's grace through faith in Christ was weak and convoluted with a central theme of mysticism.

If a person doesn't have Love with Charity, then all is naught.

And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profits me nothing.""

  Being the devoted, faithful Catholic that I am, I take Christmas very seriously about the true meaning of the holiday season that has been unfortunately commercialized by society. I'm not saying that I don't enjoy a good gift for Christmas, or a good egg nog latte, or Christmas carol all through out December, but The birth of Jesus Christ means the world to me. This movie right here is the perfect representation of how Christmas is really supposed to be spent and celebrated. Sure you have your big holiday films such as Home Alone, White Christmas, Elf, Santa Claus, etc. really big critically acclaimed films that do make the holidays a lot of fun to enjoy. But it's not like this, which is probably why it didn't get enough recognition.

  In this film, a retired pastor (Hans Matheson) is brought back into service when he gets a request to become the local preacher of an English town called Gladbury. There he discovers the townsfolk have a powerful belief in a tradition they call the Christmas Candle, a candle selected every year around Christmas by an angel to provide a miracle for someone special. While at first the pastor is very skeptical about the chances of this being true, he later discovers that miracles don't come from just a simple little candle, but in each and every one of us with the best intentions for others, that is where the miracles are found. There is a huge focus on God as the towns people rely on Him constantly to help them in their needs as well as the pastor who little by little finds himself questioning his own stance on faith.

  The film has a beautiful message about real love, care, compassion, giving to others, having a strong faith, and above all, especially for all Christians, the miracle that was the birth of Baby Jesus. You don't find this a lot in lots of other Christmas films and if you do, they're found in very little metaphorical manners. The setting is beautiful of old England style creating a grander emphasis on the beauty aspect of life and the gift that God gives us to be able to enjoy lushy, green, beautiful paradises if one thinks of it that way. The film shines through it's impressive cast which include a few familiar faces such as Samantha Barks (Les Miserables), Sylvester McCoy (The Hobbit Trilogy), Lesley Manville (Maleficent), and the singer Susan Boyle, who shines through her miraculous song ""Miracle Hymn"".

  While I don't have much else to say about this extraordinary film, I will say that this is a must have for every believer and even non-believer if they look deep inside themselves and follow their hearts, they might just hear a calling to it. The Christmas Candle is a masterpiece on every level from acting to camera work and a true reminder for us all what we really should be celebrating about during the Christmas season.

God bless you all my fellow Amazon shoppers.",1485302400,,2952,4.664739884393064

6532360,4,B00M0JU1XU,"A very long music video for Susan Boyles song Miracle Hymn.  With a bit of a plot tossed in for good measure.  The story involves a cynical pastor (Hans Matheson) with a grudge against God.  He ends up serving in a village where they expect a Christmas angel to show up every 25 years to bless a candle that provides a miracle.  Light this and pray.  The legend endures in spite of the pessimistic pastor who gives an ill-advised sermon on good works rather than salvation through Christ.  He scoffs at the idea of a lucky candle.  Meanwhile, the candle-maker plots to keep the magic candle rather than give it to someone needy.  When he and his wife misplace the candle, they decide to give everyone a candle and let them think its the miracle candle.

What can you do when you have a dreary pastor who doesnt believe in miracles and a self-serving candle-maker who does.............just as electricity is coming into popular use?

Almost religious enough for the holiday, though it does present itself more like a fairy tale.",1482883200,,1027,4.655555555555556

Just a note about this story - it is more inclined towards believing a Christmas candle answering prayer if you have the angel-chosen candle. And a pastor's work at church (electric lightbulbs to replace candle) was mocked by the author and causing chaos and unbelief in the church-goers. That part is discouraging. Kind of disappointing to see that in Max Lucado's story.
On the other hand, Susan Boyle's singing was beautiful.",1482883200,,489,4.903614457831325

Gladbury has its own Christmas legend - every 25 years an angel visits the local candlemaker on Christmas Eve and blesses one candle. Whoever lights this candle receives a miracle. David struggles to inspire faith in the townspeople that goes beyond this superstition.

After a bit he discovers that they have a Christmas Tradition of a magical Christmas Candle.  Every Christmas the folks write their wish on a piece of paper and put it in a box for a drawing to see who gets the candle and therefore their wish.

However, this movie was made at Pinewood Studios, in Britain, and has the high production standards and good acting the Brits are known for (in contrast to the aforesaid Hallmark Channel.)  The Brits also know how to produce an authentic costume drama.  Set in the late Victorian era in the picturesque English village of Gladbuy, the story revolves around a blessed candle that grants a prayer every fifteen years at Christmas,.  The male lead is a skeptical new parson whose religious doubt stems from personal tragedy.  Interestingly, his romantic interest is also a sceptic.  When the Christmas candle is lost, the people of Gladbury must struggle to find their way back to faith by relying on each other.

6533760,1,B00M0JU1XU,"This movie stinks. That may be harsh, but the truth is it was supposed to be written by a top Christian author. It seems in today's modern world people are trying make Christianity more palpable. Substituting a MAGIC candle for JESUS CHRIST is a grave error in the film. What a way to trivialize our Savior who died a bloody death for the sins of the world. This film was actually promoting a NEW AGE message in blind faith and it failed to make Jesus the object of our faith. This movie did not make me and my husband feel comfortable at all. It was actually a rather strange film as noted in some other reviews here. For many Christians who will be seeing this film, they will be disappointed that the gospel and the Lord of Salvation were no where to be found.",1482451200,5,763,4.305555555555555

My opinion is that it teaches the idolatry of seeking worldly things rather than spiritual things and the belief in the myth of God's providence apart from covenant. Such entitlement theology is prevalent in our churches. The spiritual growth of Christians is stunted because of it. The movie, which is so contrived and unrealistic, taught quite the opposite of what the gospel teaches. I do not recommend this movie to anyone seeking truth in Christ and Christmas.",1482451200,,607,5.01980198019802

Caused the viewer to examine our life of faith in Christ and consider, ""Are we works oriented only or do we fully trust in the Grace and miracle working power of God in Christ?"" This movie seemed to reveal the fruit of each and yet  the emptiness of them when they are in isolation from one another. In the end, I think the point was that God's Grace is alive and well, He continues to work miracles in our lives, and that same Grace propels and stirs faith-filled works.",1482364800,,645,4.551724137931035

Susan Boyle's voice is beautiful as usual when she sings a few songs in the story. I was surprised to see her in a movie. I find Susan Boyle as an inspiration to older women to still reach for a dream. Her part was almost a cameo, and she seemed a bit uncomfortable acting, but her voice was wonderful.

It is all centered on a legend of a Christmas candle which grants the owner one special answer to a prayer. Will he bow to pressure from the town's people to preach about this legendary miracle? Or will he be able to teach them that they themselves, can be the answer to someone's prayers?

God has his people to burn offering to Him which is symbolized by lighting a candle.  Now a days they are scented and I do light candles often while praying to my miracle working God who is on the thrown of my life.  God tells us in James ""we have not because we ask not, and then when we do it is with the wrong motive.""  This movie is so much about that.  So as you leave a review, I pray that you truly have the correct motive and a humble heart so that God can work a miracle in you too.  Thank you for this wonderful message.

An esteemed author and a surefire setting encouraged me to sit through the entire movie, something the actual production values did not merit. Good talent not stretching to excellence. Lack of director diligence? And pacing faltered (my ""muddled"" comment above) repeatedly. Camera angles were beyond safe, to the extent of being pedestrian.
I was not--as evidently intended--uplifted. I found myself a little indignant and more than a little incensed, in fact. Because the messages I received were, ""It's a thing Christians are gonna see,"" and ""They have no taste and will never know the difference,"" and ""It is good enough for them.""

It does show that there's power in faith--but in this case it's faith in a candle that is blessed by an angel rather than faith in the Lord. Has some excellent supporting actors ( the candle-maker and his wife) whose presence onscreen outshines the main characters. Nevertheless,there are some nice special effects,it's clean and family friendly, and doesn't skimp on production.",1481587200,,542,5.313953488372093

6536713,1,B00M0JU1XU,"The overall hope and message depicted in this movie was miraculous candles sent by an angel. Anything or anyone who becomes the object of our worship is an idol. Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior and all hope is in Him, not in miracles or a candle that brings miracles. I have read a lot of Max Lucado's books in the past and have been blessed as Max typically points people to Christ. Something went awry in this movie though. I am disappointed if this movie was done with Max's approval or story line. It was a very 'new age' type of teaching. I believe miracles happen even today, but all praise and glory goes to God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit as the source of the miracles, not candles nor angels. Unfortunately, that message was left untold.",1481328000,3,750,4.402877697841727

6536716,1,B00M0JU1XU,"Horrible and dangerous theology.  This is exactly why many non-Christians scoff at and mock Christianity.  The God of the Bible is the sovereign Creator of heaven and earth, and He answers the prayers of Christians as He sees fit, for His glory.  The gospel is about God's plan to redeem fallen man through the incarnation, perfect life, death, burial, and resurrection of His Son, Jesus Christ...all for His glory.  Those who trust in Christ for the forgiveness of their sins will spend eternity with Him.  This movie aligns with the false gospel of Joel Osteen and others who tout a prosperity, or health and wealth, gospel from a god who seeks to reward men on this side of eternity with whatever they pray for.  The reverend was wrong to dismiss the power of prayer because his prayers were not answered the way he wanted, and the townspeople were wrong to believe that ""hope"" is the secret ingredient to turn God into a genie to answer our prayers.  C'mon fellow Christians, read the Bible and reject this ""fluff"" for real Truth!",1481328000,8,1034,4.711111111111111

6536764,5,B00M0JU1XU,"A thoughtful and sensitive story on the journey of lives intertwined with hope, despair, doubt, faith, miracles and practical Christian love. It shows how we often go in need, live in want, and yes, even pray for things when tragically, the Church (not the institution so much, but the body of Christ), has the means, if not the will, to be the answer to prayer.  Jesus said, ""By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. - John 13:35.  And yes, miracles do happen in places where people believe.  But as the true believers know, see and experience, earnest prayer (coupled with obedience - James 5:16, doesn't require special dispensations or candles.  This movie demonstrates clear Biblical teaching, ""You do not have because you do not ask God, James 4:2. Answers to prayer can be found in confession, repentance, obedience and prayerful petition; not from perfect people because there are none.  This movie proclaims ""the God who is there."" A God who ""sits high, but looks on the lowly.""  It exhorts Christians to proclaim Christ by loving acts of service and to believe and pray even in our darkest hours.",1481328000,2,1155,4.778894472361809

However, the supposed ""Christian"" story makes a candle the object of worship and even converts the minister of the church to do the same! In the scriptures this is called idolatry. Presently those celebrating ""Christmas"" sing songs of adoration and praise to inanimate Christmas trees, a fictional and animated character named Santa Claus, who has been awarded sainthood since he fictionally hands out free gifts, and now a candle! The scriptures state that an evil generation seeks miracles. Additionally, the only object of praise, adoration, and worship for the genuine church is Christ? Did a candle, Christmas Tree, or a fictional character die to give sinners forgiveness and eternal life? I am disappointed with Max Lucado.",1481241600,4,792,5.244094488188976

6537929,5,B00M0JU1XU,"In the Roman Catholic faith calendar we are now celebrating the season of Advent, the period including the four Sundays just before Christmas.  The word means COME.  The Christmas Candle portrays beautifully the waiting and wanting to celebrate not only the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ, but all the desires of the human heart.  The citizens long to be the recipient of The Christmas Candle, linked in years past to an angel giving the holder of same an answer to their prayers.  A miracle.  Who will receive the candle this year?  You have to watch the film to find out.  For me it had more meaning.  I was born on Christmas Eve in 1943.  My mother told me that I was the answer to her prayer, to conceive and bear a child, for the doctors had told her she would not be able to do so.  Lo and behold, I was the answer to her prayers, and she always told me I was the best Christmas gift she ever got.  I cried like a baby at the end of the film, for I miss her terribly.  You too will cry watching this very special movie.  Merry Christmas to all and may you receive your ""Christmas Candle"" in answer to your prayers,",1480809600,8,1123,4.240566037735849

6537967,2,B00M0JU1XU,"Well, in a word, boring. The movie is about the legend of the spirit of giving through the gift of a single candle blessed by an angel. The acting is about as dull as it comes. Some of the characters have some personality but they are minor parts, and the major parts are acted with such boring delivery you begin to hope it all comes to an end soon; thank God there are no commercials. I believe the story is okay - I haven't read the book - but the casting, acting, and directing lack luster.",1480723200,3,494,4.15625

Not this one. Even more, it lifted my heart and increased my faith in the power of believing in Christ no matter our deep losses in this life and believing in His ability to care for us and provide if we keep believing and trusting in Him. It also depicts the joy of Christian community, something that is greatly lacking but greatly desired in our churches and Christian homes.",1480550400,,552,4.642857142857143

So we added one. Mostly terrible but one gripping dark scene in the middle worth watching where the church almost burns down (it's made of brick, so almost burns), a man has a heart attack, and the pastor almost slips to the dark side. Watch that part. Not your most classic Christian movie.",1480118400,,461,4.566265060240964

Very beautiful story. Love, love, loved it!!",1479600000,,401,4.0886075949367084
6538648,5,B00M0JU1XU,"This was such a pleasant surprise of a movie. This movie has heart, the magical Christmas atmosphere, faith and the power of prayer, and miracles. I loved the atmosphere of the small town, the different families in it with their differing struggles and triumphs, the little church, the legend of the candle, and the journey of the reverent himself. This movie made me feel as if I had traveled inside the dreamy world of a Christmas snow globe (that is the closest description I can think of). I didn't expect to see ""Susan Boyle"" in here, she's not very good as an actress but is serviceable in her role, but her beautiful singing makes up for that. Of the Christmas movies I have watched so far, this is one of the most well-produced and heartfelt Christmas movies. Overall this is a great family Christmas movie.",1479600000,13,815,4.627586206896551

6539362,4,B00M0JU1XU,I enjoyed watching The Christmas Candle by Max Lucado. It is a good reminder of celebrating Christmas as it used to be. The Candle part of the story is an interesting twist on the celebration too. The film has quite a number of pretty well known actors from other period stories I've seen over the years. It's nice to watch this with the whole family too; very heartwarming.,1478476800,,374,4.514705882352941
6539363,5,B00M0JU1XU,"I was actually surprised -- pleasantly surprised by how well this movie was made. As we all are aware (but are ashamed to admit), most ""Christian"" or faith films leave a lot to be desired. Like, acting, for example. This one has a few familiar names, but it also was well thought-out and was a joy to watch.

I definitely would recommend this movie to anyone wishing for a Christmas miracle in the way of entertainment worth watching.",1478476800,,434,4.564102564102564

6539366,4,B00M0JU1XU,"English village setting is charming for this Christmas movie with a strong Christian feel. Aspects of Christian religion is discussed and shown in multiple church scenes and the main chars is a ""father"", but it's not really preachy or silly or anything. I usually don't make it a point to watch movies with a religious message because it's usually cheesy, but I found this to be different. It's more of a window into the lives of a close knit community during the Christmas seasons and their local experience of unexplained miracles which are rooted in one family's candle making business.

I bought the DVD for the film, NOT so I could watch over and over again the previews of films that I might not be interested in.  On other DVD's I have noticed that a lot of the previews are of films I already own.  So there are to types of previews, one, for DVD's I already own and, two, for DVD's I am not interested in.

It was good to show the pastors' pain and his recovery with the Lords endless love.  Sometimes I hear testimonies, ""I was sick/hurt/rejected and all of a sudden I 'm fine"" vacant of any time of suffering and working it through with the Lord.  My life has been ups and downs with awesome times with the Lord and way down depression.  People look at me funny because I may be without praise showing just sadness or anger.  We need to be honest with our struggles, then more people would listen and be deeply touched by God.

 It also was not so shallow as to leave out the true meaning of Christmas and the birth of the Savior Jesus Christ.

6540084,1,B00M0JU1XU,"Don't buy this movie.  I'm writing this review even though I never saw the main feature.  For over  5 minutes we were harangued by a ""commercial"" about the First Amendment and freedom. I'm as patriotic as the next guy.  I served my country during war which is more than most of the people who are lecturing me about ""freedom"" can say.  My issue is that you can't fast forward through all this slanted perspective.  We just wanted to see the movie.  Ironic, isn't it?  To talk about ""freedom"" and not give a person the choice to hear it or not.",1450656000,3,543,4.36
6540085,3,B00M0JU1XU,"I reviewed the book, stating that I liked the book better.

What I will give the movie is this:

+ The plot is ""fleshed out"" better, than it may be in Lucado's.
- However, the differences in character(s), and backstories that the movie has done, does, I believe, detriment to the story. The book is better.

+ Susan Boyle is a great singer... Just a great singer. Her first acting job capitalized on her great singing, because she didn't have great acting.

+ I watched the special features, and Lucado said, ""We were glad to showcase the great work of the Salvation Army in this film,"" as the Reverend is working for them at the beginning. It reminded me that they were not show-cased in the book, and thus caused me to wonder, ""Okay, sure, kudos to the Salvation Army, but it seems a rather unrelated plot point,"" and it truly is.

The movie adds a plot line that isn't in the book, and that is the community's aversion to electricity. It seems rather unrelated and unnecessary.

The book's character development of the Reverend, to me, is much more preferable than the movie's character development, especially the book Reverend's ""dark past"" compared to the movie's version of it.

I felt like the Christmas Candle movie was just hoping to capitalize off of Downton Abbey-esque motif, and settled with, I think, a sad treatment of Lucado's rich book. I am surprised to see Lucado's kudos of the story.

It sits on my shelf, and occasionally comes out around Christmas to remind me of how cheesy it is, and how I should probably just be rid of the movie and be content with the book.",1450137600,2,1586,4.579505300353357

And how in spite of people trying to control the outcome of Christmas it's the Holy Spirit that we need to guide us, not our own agenda.  Faith and love through Jesus are the best motivators to keep moving on the path of righteousness laid out for us. I enjoyed Susan Boyle's gifted voice as well.",1449619200,3,510,4.543478260869565

It had a very limited theater showing and in many ""blue states"" it was nowhere to be found. Shame on you!  I hate to sound like a commercial, but get this movie soon while supplies last.  I ordered several dozen last year and gave them to my dearest friends and supporters. Some, I drove in the middle of the night to their homes in order to place it their mailboxes before Christmas.

6540272,3,B00M0JU1XU,"I only bought this because my wife asked me to.

We saw this when it was first released in the fall of 2014. I had NOT read the story beforehand. Diane has told me the author (Max Lucado) is one of her favorites. I didn't think the story was anything special but it was ok. I felt the acting was stiff and the plot a little hard (for me anyway) to follow.

And let's just say it's a good thing that Susan Boyle has a day job singing (and she's great at doing that!)

For the first time I'm going to give **2 ratings** - one for me and one for my wife. I rated this a average movie - a 5.75 to 6.25 out of 10 - my wife (Diane) rated this a much higher 7.75 to 8.25 - so I guess this one depends on how you feel about the source material and the author!",1426032000,,751,3.770700636942675

6540335,5,B00M0JU1XU,"I found this movie wonderful and enjoyable in many ways.  For me, the visual scenic beauty was a source of delight which grew throughout the tale.  The subtlety of the lovely colors and muted lighting of the sets and costumes gave a special, almost dreamy beauty to the overall ""lighting"" and coloration and this was appropriate to the theme of light - Light as represented in old-fashioned candlelight rather than worldly new harsh electrical lighting.  Such two kinds of light were contrasted in the story for additional symbolic meaning:  The light of a jarring new materialistic industrial age was making its advent into the softer atmosphere of the older ways of life as represented by Gladbury and its singular precious tradition of ""The Christmas Candle""...

(The dreaminess of the lighting and softness of outlines, or the sort of haziness-around-the-edges of the world depicted in The Christmas Candle reminded me of the mysterious town called ""Brigadoon"" in the musical of the same name, although the two places in the two different productions are not really comparable to any great extent otherwise.  But, anyway, there were features in Christmas Candle that suggested to me ""another place in time"" or something of the sort.  I think that effect was probably intentional on the part of the movie-maker.)

I especially liked the use of the Insignia--the winged candle that symbolized the town of Gladbury.  (The town's name is meaningful in terms of the theme and ultimate ending of the tale.)

Just at the opening of the film, there was a brief view of what seemed to be a Title Page in a pretty storybook.  The page seemed to be drawn and painted in the style of storybooks of the ""Victorian Age,"" the age of sentimental Dickens.  As this opener Page passed briefly across the screen, I noticed a pretty blue and white teacup and I thought, ""Ah, Max Lucado is inviting me to have a cup of tea with him while I take in his story.""  (Was interested to observe the ""actual"" tea set itself later in a domestic scene as the movie progressed.)

This is a movie comparable to the type of ""Classics"" stories (in settings of the past) as produced by Masterpiece Theatre on PBS.  It has, of course, the distinct but subtle Christian theme (which is, however, not overbearingly evangelical or over-obvious).  The settings and the characters are somewhat reminiscent of Dickens stories but only somewhat, not a lot.  This story has its own unique quality.

As in Dickens stories, there are quite lovable characters.  Dear ""folk"" types.

A central message of the story is that while the Christianity that Jesus engendered IS about selflessness and generosity and the performance of mere ordinary, everyday kinds of Good Deeds, it is still also a religion in which actual Miracles take place.  Both kinds of phenomena, the ordinary and the extraordinary, are intertwined; and both are matters of Wonderment and Gladness.  That Jesus is the Light of the World and the source of Gladness (Joy), particularly in the specific Christmas custom of the ""miraculous candle"" in this tale set in this particular unique, almost dreamlike, little town of the past, is also the message at the heart of the story.

It seems to me that ALL of the characters were Main Characters, not just David and his Emily. I thought the acting of Susan Boyle was lovely and absolutely lovable and endearing.  She was a very effective actress as were ALL of the other characters.

I have no criticisms of the movie.  I wondered if Rev. David ought to have looked maybe about 15 years older--like maybe about 40 or 45 years old, because that would give him enough time to fit time-wise into the history of his past life and loss and departure from his previous substantial preacher's calling.  Also, it seems a few more years would match him up more closely with the vague picture of the woman in his past life whose picture appeared to suggest an age of about 35-40.

(I think that women might like this movie better than men because they will be sensitive to the scenic beauty in it, which is one of the movie's superb features.  Men who like only Christian movies set within modern-day realities, sports contests, or other clearly masculine topics might find the movie uncomfortably ""pretty."")",1423267200,,4265,4.852209944751381

6540412,5,B00M0JU1XU,"I love this movie, it fact I got one for myself, loved it so much, I purchased 5 more and gave them to friends and family for Christmas, along with a Christmas candle.  One of my friends mentioned that she lit the candle and make a wish, to her amazement the wish came true.  Now I can't say that will happen for you, because you have to believe in order for your wish to come true.  Without given to much away, this is a wonderful story, with wonderful, seasoned actors. Even though the story line is in the past, the whole story gave me sure hope, it made me believe again that there are people out there who are the miracle and that I too can be part of that.  I've watched the movie 3 times already.  Things happen for a reason.  Reading some of the other reviews, I think they missed the point, which was everyone's wish came true, but not because of the candle, but from letting themselves believe and helping each other, that was the true miracle, their faith.",1421280000,,967,4.285714285714286

6540452,5,B00M0JU1XU,"Is a really good movie, have a GREAT message. i didn't read the book, i need to buy it so i can't compare. But i really like the movie, i mean i can watch it with my parents, oma, and my little fellows, because is familiar, have no obscene scene, not even a bad word.
I love the message they gave us. Maybe you aren't a Christ follow, but sometimes we focused in looking for the medicine taking with the  nurse, and even when she knows many thing, she haven't all the answers or even the power to authorize some examples to find out what the disease is, but we still focused in the nurse... We have to go direct to de doctor, the one who made more years of school and can bring you more information. Is the same, SPOILER! : they (the people of the town) are focused in fire one candle that an angel touch and pray in front so what you are asking will be give it to you, but it was just one candle! to all the village! And yes, the miracle was given, but the other people where sad because they got nothing, and wait till the next year to try to get the candle... but something happened (im not gonna write it, so you have to find out in the book or movie) and everyone got one candle, so everyone in the town fire one candle and pray with all their forces, and even when those candles whereat the one that the angel touch, they received their miracle.
Sometimes you are so focused in the miracle, that you didn't realize if the way you are taking is the right one, sometimes we take some ""short-way"" that became in extra-large-way... we can go right direct in front of the fire that give the light of the candle and ask for help and He will give it. This movie is a Christian massage movie, and teach you that the real light is Christ and also that He use everything to make a miracle happen",1420761600,,1791,4.131805157593123

6540468,2,B00M0JU1XU,Max Lucado is a wonderful storyteller.  I love to read his stories and I am sure this story in book form was great.  It did not however make for a good movie.  It simply did not work.  The movie tried to do too much and the marginal acting did not help either.  I watched it with a friend and she felt the same way so I know it wasn't just me who felt that way about the movie. Even the singing wasn't up to expectations.  The song was forgettable. I'm sure the director worked hard but the movie didn't come to life.,1420588800,5,517,4.019607843137255

6540491,2,B00M0JU1XU,After reading the reviews and seeing that the film featured Susan Boyle I decided to buy this having never seen if before.  I kept hoping it would be good as I watched but found it to be a depressing story.  Even given the time frame and setting it still felt flat and I could not even care about the characters.  I wish I had paid a rental fee of a dollar or two to see this rather than wasting fifteen.  I would not recommend purchasing it without seeing it first.,1420416000,5,466,4.144444444444445

6540509,1,B00M0JU1XU,"The movie itself isn't awful. Not very good, but not awful. About the crisis of faith of a young minister who doesn't buy into the ""miracle"" his parishioners attribute to a miraculous candle at Advent. Of course, he's taught to see the error of his ways (I think? The whole movie was kind of a muddle. But he almost burns down his church and gives heart attacks to a couple of his parishioners (literally) in the meantime. A typical Max Lucado morality story: a straightforward enogh message, but a long time getting to the point. Basically a pretty tedious movie at core. There's a nice song by Susan Boyle, offered in her pleasant-enough voice-- about five times altogether!
But this was all bearable and forgiveable. It's Christmas after all. But what isn't to be forgiven is the way that this film's producers force you (no fast forwarding through) to sit through at least fifteen minutes of ads for their other forgettable movies (which one did not order)-- including once reprehensible right wing screed featuring the ilk of Governor/Reverend/ Right Wing Zealot/ Diet Guru Mike Huckabee crying tears about how the government in Washington (that is, the Satanic Demcrats under Sheik Obama) are persecuting their particular brand of Christians.
I bought this film to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, not to be forced to listen to Huckabee and company, and I deeply resent this bait & switch.",1420416000,8,1399,4.9071729957805905

He helps the people of the village to learn to help one another and it was tremendous.
Susan Boyle had a bigger part that I had thought and she was fantastic.

6540577,4,B00M0JU1XU,"A beautiful little story about the importance of both faith and putting faith into action.  I was pleasantly surprised that the acting was decent, for the most part, and the story was not forced- although predictable in some plot points.  *Warning: Spoiler* I would have like to know ahead of time, since I watched this with my 8-year-old child, that a decisive part of the plot involved a woman abandoned while pregnant and unmarried by another character.  This turns out to be a sort of providential coincidence that is joyful in the end-but hard for a young child to understand.  A couple minor complaints: I would have preferred the producers use some other special effect in the ""miracle"" scenes- they are a bit cheesy and too Mary Poppins-like, and the spontaneous kiss of the preacher and a single woman before communicating any serious intentions seemed a bit out of place in a Christian film.  Overall a nice Christmas story that your family that shares Christian values will enjoy watching.",1420156800,,1000,4.893491124260355

6540588,5,B00M0JU1XU,"I was delighted to find this underrated movie.  I first rented it and loved it so much I bought it for my kindle.  This is a very lovely Christmas story that has the feel of a Les Miserables, or perhaps a Dickens classic tale.  This is a great family movie, that talks about faith, prayer, and miracles, taking place in a small town in England in 1890.  I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone that enjoys Period piece movies.  A great new Christmas classic I will watch again and again with my family.",1420070400,,509,4.315789473684211

Sorry, really don't like paying for a movie and then being forced to sit through 15 minutes of advertising in my own living room.  Never had any other dvd where they wouldn't even let you fast forward through the previews but this one wouldn't allow it.  Had to watch them all.
Update Mar 20 2015.  Now that I've calmed down, it was a good movie like most Max Lucado stuff.  I just detest being forced to watch sales material on a product I paid full price for.

The new minister comes to the town and at first starts to tell people the truth about Jesus. Then it flips and everyone including the new minister start believing the candle miracle when people start talking about their prayers coming true because of the candle. What kind of message is this film trying to present? If its going to be about some Christmas candle miracle just leave at that. The way it is presented is as if they are saying do not have faith in Jesus, because if you want the miracle it ain't happening without the candle.",1418256000,22,764,4.464285714285714

Hans Matheson does a great job portraying the new pastor who has a past that haunts him. He is not preachy in the ""eye rolling"" sense that some films of this genre tend to portray. He is very down to earth (and not bad to look at either.) The actors are delightful (love the candle shop owners), as is the small town scenery in England.

6541116,5,B00M0JU1XU,"GIFT THIS DVD, it's that good. Heart-warmer.
Stored with the Christmas tree and trims are books and DVDs so good they are worth an annual look. This will be included in our annual DVD viewing.

Perfect family entertainment, and keeps the ""good will for others"" theme that Scrooge made so famous decades ago. It pushes the idea of giving and helping others at Christmas time, rather than the greedy segment often seen. It is good holiday fare for any person of any faith, at least anyone who celebrates Christmas in some way. The late 1800s period with fantastic costumes, props, and excellent cinematography, makes it timeless. The music is worth the DVD price itself. A great cast makes this holiday new classic shine.
There's more in this film than found in the Max Lucado book, both good in their own way.
Susan Boyle debuts as an actress, not perfect, but when she sings the miracle of her voice astonishes over and over. She's highlighted during a church service with congregational singing of the movie theme song ""Miracle Hymn."" She also has a bonus live performance solo rendition of the song included.
5 Dove seals, as good as it gets for wholesome family viewing.

Another reviewer went ballistic on the DVD manufacturer forcing the viewing of previews, one a slanted political view. No menu, no fast-forward, a mandate if you wish to see the feature. It's true--AND VERY TACKY. It is also a sinful shame, as it is the only negative I could find with this Christmas DVD.
DO NOT REJECT THIS FILM FOR THE UNFORTUNATE LACK OF MENU.
One of the previews encouraged me to immediately place an order on Amazon for another film.

I'm a practicing Catholic but my reaction to these films initially is are they that good or are they preaching to the choir?  This year I saw ""Heaven is for Real"" and ""Moms' Night Out"" and my expectations were exceeded.  I approached this film with the same trepidation and thankfully my fears were not realized.  Ironically the main character in this film is a minister experiencing a crisis of faith which I think makes the message of miracles and divine intervention more effective.  The film espouses the idea that miracles are an everyday occurrence and come in forms we either don't imagine or in ways that we don't really expect but heal our psychic wounds nonetheless. A hopeful and optimistic enterprise on all counts.  A terrific film that thankfully is gaining an audience on home video.",1416700800,,874,4.832214765100671

There are just so many good spiritual lessons throughout the film.  It wasn't ""preachy"" ... it dealt with many real, diverse people living their lives in a small community in the 1890s, but the problems of life then were as contemporary as life now.

The scenery, the actors, the period costumes, the music, was perfect in every way.  It was a serious story and an imaginative story, but it was full of humor and laughter and lessons to learn.  The real meaning of Christmas and being a Christian came through in a unique way.  It was a story of sadness and happiness.

The price is so low on Amazon, it is a great gift for a friend or yourself.  I would have paid full price, since I wanted to get the dvd for a year now.",1416268800,5,868,4.174698795180723

If you want to throw your money away on garbage like this, be my guest I stayed with this movie for almost an hour hoping it would get better. It finally reached a point where I could no longer stand it. I keep getting rude letters from people who liked this movie. I have an opinion as well and if you don't like my opinion that is your problem. This is probably the worst Christmas movie I have ever watched and I stand by this review. I misplaced this movie and found it a few days after Christmas. I decided to give it another shot. It is a little better this time. I actually made it to the end. The movie is still not something to wrtie home about. Very slow movie and a very mediocre ending.",1415577600,18,844,4.090361445783133

The story from bestselling storyteller, Max Lucado is a great foundation combines with a wonderful cast of British actors, beautiful period sets and scenery and inspiring music from Susan Boyle to truly satisfy our Christmas movie appetite.

This movie is unlike almost all other Christmas movies.  Can you name a Christmas movie, other than a nativity story, that is actually about Christmas?  Candle is actually about the miracle of Christmas, not Santa or the commercial sentimental Christmas.  Like Christmas, Candle is about Christ with us and what that miracle means to each of us in our lives.

6541232,1,B00M0JU1XU,"Simply put, this of one of the most beautiful films ever made. The story is a complex multigenerational plot weaving intrigue and mystery set against one huge Victorian snow-scene. Be prepared for a roller coaster of a ride as the story unfolds. I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end, and glad I had the foresight to bring a box of tissues with me for the unexpected tragedies that befall some of the characters. The acting is superb and  the scenery simply breathtaking. Newcomer Susan Boyle steals the show with her splendidly articulate and animated acting which makes Hans Matheson, Sylvester McCoy, and James Cosmo seem like dullards by comparison. And who would have thought she had a voice of an Angel too? What a bonus.

But back to reality: I never thought I'd say this, but I would rather sit through a re-screening of John Boorman's debacle, Zardoz, than suffer this simple-minded, asinine trite.

I was forced to endure this mindless presentation last year, and my wife (who was the enforcer in this episode), subsequently read the book upon which this was based and informed me that the film actually did a good job of such a poorly written drivel. The mind boggles.

Please also keep up with the ""unhelpful"" votes too, as this really reinforces the value of the Amazon review system, which is designed to allow alternate points of view! (I am of course being ironic here for those who understand the concept). If you only wanted to review positive reviews why did you read this one at all? It was never going to influence your viewpoint or your purchasing choice. Clearly you have already decided you ""like"" the film, so just buy it, put some Xmas carols on in the background, grab a box of tissues and then watch it, preferably following up with, Where the Red Fern Grows...",1414368000,25,1802,4.6750788643533125

I laughed out loud when she was pretending to cry in her hands. Otherwise, it is very slow. I fell asleep when someone died. The movie theatre was empty with nothing there to keep me awake. I woke up when the church caught on fire towards the end of this Dickens setting movie. I wouldn't watch it again. Only cost me $7 to see this movie but I saw The Hunger Games movie right after.

My family and I saw The Christmas Candle movie three times in Houston, TX, in November, 2013 and we loved it. The first time we went to see it, our attention was all on Susan Boyle, because it was Susan's debut film role. She played Eleanor Hopewell in this special movie role which was written for her and she introduced a new song, Miracle Hymn, written exclusively for her to sing in the movie.  We were waiting just for that and we were delighted.  The second time we went and enjoyed the wonderfully warm story played out by terrific actors. So heartwarming, that it brought tears to our eyes.  And, the third time we simply took it all in and enjoyed the entire production.  It is an amazing movie the whole family can enjoy.
