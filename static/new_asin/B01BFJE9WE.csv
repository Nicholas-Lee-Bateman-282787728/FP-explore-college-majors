7633378,4,B01BFJE9WE,"""Heart of a Dog"" (2015 release; 75 min.) is a non-fiction movie by musician/performance artist Laurie Anderson. As the movie opens, we see a cartoon-animated Laurie Anderson inform us that ""this is my dream body"" and that in her dream she gives birth to an adult dog whom she calls Lolabelle. It's not long before Laurie starts reflecting on her dying mother, 9/11, SIDS, and a bunch of other things.

Couple of comments: Laurie Anderson, best known for her minimalist music such as ""O Superman"" from the early 80s, is no stranger to movie making. Here she takes two particular tough periods in her life, the decline and death of her rat terrier Lolabelle and the decline and death of her mother, to weave a collage of images and montage of sound, supplemented by Laurie's spoken words in which she explores ""the connection between love and death"" (Laurie's words) and everything in between. One might call it a stream of consciousness, except that Laurie is not rambling in the least. Let me tell you. it makes for one amazing movie experience. It's like being in a dream. if not a trance, where things somehow become a lot clearer. Let me also mention that I was vaguely aware of the movie, along the lines of: ""that's the documentary about Laurie's dog"", and I almost did not watch the movie for that reason. As it turns out, the movie devotes only about 10-15 min. to the dog, and the movie is not even a documentary. So it was a complete misconception on my part what this movie was about (and to be honest, the movie's title only reinforced that misconception). Last but not least, Laurie's husband Lou Reed (who passed away in 2013) isn't mentioned a single time, but an excellent song of his, ""Turning Time Around"", does play over the movie's end titles.  Please note: you don't have to be a fan of Laurie Anderson to appreciate this movie (but it certainly doesn't hurt if you are).

""Heart of a Dog"" showed up out of the blue and without any pre-release buzz or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati last weekend. The early evening screening when I saw it a few days ago was not attended well (three people, including myself), and I noticed that it will drop out of the theater after today. That's a shame, as this is a remarkable movie in many respects, and by all means deserves a wider audience. If you are in the mood for something very different, all the while realizing that is a deeply personal essay and film from Laurie Anderson, I encourage you to check it out, be it on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Heart of a Dog"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1457568000,33,2604,4.595698924731183

7633380,1,B01BFJE9WE,"there is absolutely no denying Laurie Anderson's talent as a 20th century artiste of 'immense talent and gift', but this 'documentary' is far too 'much' in the 'sentimental-side-of-things. I can and do appreciate and admire her works from 'big science' to 'homeland'. she really is remarkable. Heart of a dog just turns talent aside as I can see.",1501200000,,346,4.982758620689655

7633387,5,B01BFJE9WE,"Great film.  You have to watch it 2 or 3 times in order to get a feel for that style of the movie.  If you are intellectually challenged, don't watch it.  You will be frustrated with symbolisms alone.  I was drawn to it because of the dog that looks like mine.  However, was surprised by all of the other sub-themes or maybe main themes.  If nothing else, try to let yourself be entertained.",1490745600,3,391,4.287671232876712
7633388,5,B01BFJE9WE,"Another masterpiece by Laurie Anderson. It reminded me of what some biologists said about non-human animals; Its not that they are so much like us; its that we are so much like them. By recounting her late dogs reactions to the world around her, Anderson comments on humans reactions to the world around them.
Watching this definitely requires the viewers full concentration, it is not something to have on whilst otherwise occupied. The extras on the DVD are also interesting, especially the Christmas songs played by the dog on keyboards. The background interview Anderson does is also interesting, except that she devotes much of the time to advertising her other works.",1489968000,3,673,5.072072072072072

7633393,5,B01BFJE9WE,"This is one of the most touching, interesting and profound films I have ever seen.

7633400,5,B01BFJE9WE,"What a lovely film. As always true of Laurie Anderson's work, it isn't for everyone--but it will appeal to people who love poetry, or art, or just like to think. It's about death, love, fear, music and a dog.",1473984000,14,208,4.358974358974359
7633401,5,B01BFJE9WE,"Tremendously moving and beautiful, and the best capturing of Laurie Andersons unique combination of off-beat humor, heartbreak, poetry music, images, animation, stories, Buddhist philosophy and artistic experimentation yet on film.

In theory its the story of Andersons relationship with Lolabelle, her beloved terrier, as the dog moves through life towards aging and death.  But it is also clearly thematically about her love for, and loss of her husband Lou Reed, and her pondering of her own mortality and the meaning of life.

Yet as dour and daunting as that sounds,  Anderson never loses sight of the joy that abides with sorrow, knowing that there is no love without pain, and no pain without the seeds of joy.

And while its a heady mix, and resolutely refuses to act anything like a normal movie, Anderson is also the most accessible of experimentalists.  She has no interest in torturing or confounding her audience, just catching them off guard and getting them to think new ways -- but always with a smile, a wink and a chuckle at it all.  Shes a tremendously important artist, and this film is great for fans and newcomers alike.",1473552000,12,1142,4.916666666666667
7633402,4,B01BFJE9WE,"I would LIKE to watch this. However, thanks to lawyers or whoever, it's not available online via Amazon.com.  Of course.",1469145600,,120,5.0
7633403,5,B01BFJE9WE,"Laurie Anderson is an avant garde performance artist and Heart of a Dog is an arthouse film commissioned by Arte which Laurie Anderson directed. This DVD consists of the complete film and there are some extras too. There is a trailer of the film which is worth looking at first to whet your appetite. Of more interest and significance is an interview with Laurie Anderson in which she discusses the live performance piece known as ""Concert for Dogs"" and then the film ""Heart of a Dog."" In fact, these compositions are separate and different - so don't get confused!

I first got to know Heart of a Dog through listening to the CD which was released in the UK in October 2015. I fell in love with this soundtrack of the film, and found that repeated listening seemed to enrich my experience as there were multiple layers of narrative, meaning, and artistic expression to be discovered and re-interpreted.

The soundtrack is mainly spoken but is enriched with other sounds which are mainly unobtrusive consisting of sampled tunes and natural sounds. I was lucky enough to see the film on the big screen at the Brighton Festival (2016) where Laurie Anderson was the Guest Director. The soundtrack literally came to life through watching the film but I am glad that I had the opportunity to really listen and familiarise myself with the CD first.

Having said that, the film lends itself to repeated viewing because of the complexity of the content. However, the film can be enjoyed and appreciated with just one viewing. Laurie Anderson has a soft expressive voice which has a musical quality and the lyrics are quirky, profound and poetic. Laurie Anderson is telling a story, or actually a collection of short stories, and you inevitably get drawn into another world if you follow the threads.

The short stories are stitched together to create a patchwork of metaphysical surrealism in which Laurie Anderson explores the relationships between love, life, death, and spirituality. The main character through which this is explored is Lolabelle, her pet dog although much of the narrative is derived from autobiographical experiences.

Whatever else, the film is captivating and draws you into a magical place, which is what all great films have the power of doing.",1465862400,7,2262,4.926509186351706
7633404,3,B01BFJE9WE,"Honestly one point here ruined the experience for me.  I understand everyone has a right to handle the death of their pet as they choose.  But for me, the author allowing her dog to slowly suffer and die because her pastor told her that she had no right to end the suffering... I can't see the love in that.  The last act of love we can give to our dogs is a peaceful end.",1462924800,,372,4.0
7633405,5,B01BFJE9WE,"The Heart of a Dog is an okay film.  It goes for a really profound message contemplating many mysterious questions about life.  Perhaps the description shouldn't have mentioned that the narrator Laurie Anderson was Lou Reed's husband because given the release date (a couple years after his death) it deceivingly tricks viewers into thinking this movie is going to be about Lou Reed's career, life and legacy.

However perhaps Lou Reed's death was a strong inspiration for Laurie to make a movie like this.  Either way this is a good documentary but it might not be what you expect.  It starts off weird as Laurie talks about this dream she has where she's giving birth to a dog and none of the doctors think this is remotely strange.  I have similar weird dreams.  Not about giving birth since I'm a guy, but dogs talking to me like humans.  She then goes on to discuss dogs in greater detail and how one dog she had was well-loved around town but eventually went blind, and the heartache one feels when the dog had to be put down.

Laurie also frequently mentions the 911 attacks and how she moved out to California to get away from all the chaos and spookiness of that horrible period, and how security was beefed up considerably at airports after the event and eventually people became acclimated to this so nobody thought their presence was weird anymore, and how we've now programmed our minds to think that such terrorist attacks can happen in the air (hence all the scenes we see of the big blue sky).  Nothing is really mentioned of Lou Reed until later when one of his songs plays during the credits.

A lot of this stuff is interesting/profound which is why I'm giving the movie a high grade, but it's not a documentary on Lou Reed like I (and probably others) was led to think.  Still that's not reason to criticize the movie.  This movie has a certain mood perhaps due to Laurie's calming voice that makes everything feel so natural, and as a result you feel absorbed into the storytelling and her words.  With that said, the movie does wander a bit in the second half.  The first half is much better I think, perhaps because the first half focuses on her dog and I can relate to losing a dog and how difficult that is.  With that said, perhaps because I know what it's like to lose a dog that's why this aspect of the story didn't hit my emotional nerves as much.",1461801600,3,2377,4.493023255813953
7633406,5,B01BFJE9WE,"This isn't an easy film to watch, almost ninety minutes of voyeuristic practice in the art of feeling sad without being sad from a thoughtful artist who in recent years has lost her mother, dog, and husband. But this isn't a wallow in the morose. It's a meditation, presented as disorientingly as Laurie Anderson fans might expect. Her monologue reminds me of the homely story structure employed in The Ugly One with the Jewels, more voice than instrumental or electronic magic, full of wonderment not tears. We're told that crying at the death of a loved one is forbidden. It confuses the spirit of the deceased. The visuals are full of water though: rain, snow, ice. If she takes a little bit of an easy out at the end, there's no sense of victory in it, just the next thing. We're left with a moment of honesty about human nature not to be applauded or condemned. I admire that.

If and when this becomes available on DVD, I'll be first in line. The conversation I have with it will change with each exposure. To me, that's the mark of artistic greatness.",1461542400,30,1058,4.539267015706806

She chronicles the event of having a beloved pet and love of her life Lou Reed in the most unexpected way, she put it together in a dream like state. How she was able to come to terms with a mother was at odds with is something I can relate to. Anderson articulates her thoughts in a clear and provocative way.

I've loved that she's experimented seemingly fearlessly with the lines between art, music, and spoken word. This release is a great return to what Anderson does best - storytelling set to sometimes atmospheric, other times guttural music. I sat transfixed, my eyes closed, listening carefully the first time I played this and felt completely satisfied with the experience. There is everything from joy to heartbreak here, punctuated by the closing song by her husband Lou Reed, who I believe had recently passed-on when the movie and this soundtrack were released. I have yet to see the film...but this audio experience is like no other. Put the CD on, turn out the lights, lie back and close your eyes and let the experience wash over you. It is an amazing piece of art.",1504224000,3,938,4.796296296296297
