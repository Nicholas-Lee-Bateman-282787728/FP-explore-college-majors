8006435,3,B00014NF2U,"This video covers the fancy train that goes through Mexico's copper canyon. This review is more for Spanish classes than others.

For train fans, two guys and one woman give their opinions of the trip. There are lots of scenes of the train itself and the scenery, including one scene going through a tunnel that lasts 47 seconds. Another bridge crossing lasted over a minute.  The background music is very calm and soothing but pleasant. The engine number is 911.

It does have some information about the Tarahumara people. The riders of the train are all older and probably not terribly interesting to most teens. It is good for discussing Preterit, Imperfect, and Passive tenses though. My students pointed those out. Overall, pretty boring.

It does mention margaritas, whiskey, and a fully stocked bar. No violence, sex, drugs, horoscopes, or swear words to worry about.",1422921600,,874,5.006896551724138
8006436,3,B00014NF2U,"It was very interesting to me, but I bought it for my classroom. I teach teens, and they quickly got bored. I passed it on to my dad, who absolutely loved it. Great for adults, not so much for restless young people.",1395878400,,215,4.142857142857143
8006437,5,B00014NF2U,"I bought this as one of several from this great series to pass around to our family of train nuts.  I know little about trains, myself, but have always loved British movies filmed onboard, especially the Orient Express.

I had no idea that a train of this caliber was running in Mexico today, and then was further floored by the scenery and history behind this particular leg.  I especially appreciated the narrator's respectful comments about the people of this land, and his encouragement for people to take this journey to this marvelous canyon (few Americans know about) if they can.

This would make a wonderful commentary in a History or Spanish classroom, as well.",1200528000,3,671,4.859649122807017
