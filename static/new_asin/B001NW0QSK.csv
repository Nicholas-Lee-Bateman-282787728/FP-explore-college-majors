3723490,5,B001NW0QSK,"Bodystrikes is an awesome workout!  I like that Ilaria takes the time to explain and ease you into all the moves and proper form before getting too into it, which makes it easy for someone like me (the less coordinated... haha) to keep with it and be successful.  I definitely enjoyed the workout while I was doing it and the feeling after.  Highly recommend it!",1268697600,2,362,4.538461538461538
3723491,5,B001NW0QSK,"As a certified personal trainer, I have recommended this product to my clients for lower body toning and overall fitness.  It has the potential to burn well over 500 calories in a workout, as I have had intermediate/advanced clients burn over 600 in a single workout!  Tough, enjoyable, and definite calorie burner!  Top Quality!",1249516800,16,329,5.055555555555555
3723492,5,B001NW0QSK,"This is my first workout by Ilaria.  I was looking for a change with a routine where I could focus primarily on my form and use my body weight only.  This met all of my expectations.  Her cuing is precise and to the point.  I felt the effects of this workout immediately.  The combos are good and not difficult to learn; they are repeated a sufficient number of times.  Her accent is a little heavy, but I didn't mind increasing my volume to hear her more clearly.  This one has quickly become one of my favorites.  It is great alone or as a warm-up for another routine (which is how I used it initially).",1247616000,5,605,4.245614035087719
3723493,5,B001NW0QSK,This is a challenging workout with serious results.  Love her cuing and the flow she achieves in the video.  You see results immediately.  Great video!!,1240617600,,152,5.0
3723494,5,B001NW0QSK,"This is a great workout for men and women - fun and effective.

A word of warning though - if your knees aren't too good then it might be better to avoid this as there are LOTS of squats and lunges.

Other than that it's highly recommended.",1239494400,16,240,4.085106382978723
3723495,5,B001NW0QSK,"I had never worked out to anything quite like this and felt like I was having to much fun to feel like it was effective although the cardio work will let you know you are working hard. I use ilaria's 30 minute - abs & pushups along with this to get a awesome total body workout. It will help to build your strength and muscle tone in a short period of time. Ilaria's dvd's are well done with good cueing and she is very likeable. If you're looking for something a little different to add to your routine then this might do it for you, I know I really enjoy it.",1239321600,9,560,4.054054054054054
3723496,5,B001NW0QSK,"This workout is easy to follow, CHALLENGING to do, and  no equipment necessary!  Ilaria is one of the best instructors today, always developing the most effective exercises.",1232409600,2,173,5.37037037037037
3723497,5,B001NW0QSK,"WOW, what an effective workout and best of all you need is a dvd player to get the workout done.  Intense and effective, great, for many fitness levels.  Has moves that can do only one thing, WORK.  Enjoy, I did.",1230163200,,212,4.25
3723498,5,B001NW0QSK,"If you want muscular legs *and* a good sweat, this is for you. The exercises are killer as they progress, but, as Ilaria said, some of the moves are very advanced, so just take your time and you will get stronger. They even do a few push-ups in the warm-up. Be warned, though. These are for *very* muscular legs. Not ballet legs like, say, Ballet Beautiful. I don't do all the exercises on this DVD. I just pick ones that target problem areas I have. But, all in all, great DVD.",1354492800,5,478,4.263736263736264
3723499,5,B001NW0QSK,"I reviewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powerstrike-Vol-4-with-Ilaria-Montagnani/dp/B001NVW4PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powerstrike, Vol. 4 with Ilaria Montagnani</a>&nbsp;and loved it. I am not disappointed with Bodystrikes also by Ilaria Montagnani. It is 45 minutes long, just 15 min. shorter than Powerstrike but you work all 45 minutes non-stop. There are no punches in this DVD, just an awesome leg workout (kicks, leg lifts, squats, lunges) in four routines that at the end are all put together into one monster routine. Do not let the word routine bother you--the routines are easy to follow, and the transitions are easy too (no awkward steps or counts). I suppose you can do one or two routines only if you are pressed for time. I haven't really worked with the menus. I just put the DVD and play.

Similar to Powerstrike: Ilaria with other performers (6 total including Ilaria). Despite more performers, the larger number is not distracting (at least not for me). The background is well lit. All the performers are wearing shorts that emphasizes the techniques which is helpful in studying a particular move or routine. Throughout the program a modified version of each move is presented for beginners or those with problem areas (like knees or back issues). In fact, one thing I forgot to mention in my Powerstrike review is that Ilaria, is always showing how and how NOT to do a particular move; and WHY! Other videos I've owned or just watched will TELL you how to do a move but often times will not show you how or why it is particularly bad to do a move incorrectly (Kathy Smith comes to mind).

Each routine is introduced part by part and drilled before putting it together and moving on. The music is again terrific, not distracting nor too loud that you cannot hear Ilaria. This is a continuous non-stop, low impact work out--no jumping or running--but no less aerobic. For me as a beginner of this DVD it was quite a workout (my heart rate was up the whole time). I hadn't finished the 1st routine and my outer thighs were screaming (we'll see with time). I suggest you keep hydrated during the work out. I've never sweat like this, even with P90X and that is a beast!

Different from Powerstrike: Menus work better (although not interactive Matrix-like); no skipping or odd behavior from DVD. Other performers (Powerstrike had 4 performers total). Introduction is brief w/o demonstration of kicks (the DVD assumes you'll either follow along or mimic; or that you know how to do a roundhouse kick etc.) The Intro is an explanation of the routine--this is primarily a leg workout.

I love all things with this video. If I had to complain about something it is that again, as in Powerstrike, the ""cool down"" is not enough for me. The ""cool down"" portion kept my heart rate going in fact it raised it. If your heart rate does not come down quickly you will have to either pause the DVD while you cool down or cool down while they are stretching and then stretch on your own, which is what I do. She doesn't really mention anything during the cool down or why it is important to return to heart rate to a normal rate before stretching. I'm a tad old school.

If you are looking for running, jumping, punching or combination of this, BODYSTRIKES is not the DVD for you. If you are looking for a great cardio, low-impact (high intensity) leg workout, check out Bodystrikes (from your library before buying or do a search for video snippits of this DVD, they're out there).",1344729600,6,3534,4.873544093178037
3723500,5,B001NW0QSK,This is my first workout with Ilaria. She is really great. Strongly recommend. Not high cardio but you will feel it!!,1336953600,,117,4.619047619047619
3723501,5,B001NW0QSK,"This is a fabulous workout video. Although it is fast paced and intense for the first few times, once you get used to the exercises and know how to form the motions, which Ilaria teaches in a very easy to follow way, you will be able to follow along and do as much of the video as you are able and slowly build up to doing the entire video. It is intense and even doing part of the video shows great results! This workout has tightened my bottom, firmed it up and firmed up my legs very rapidly. I do exercise and am in shape but this workout gets right to those trouble areas, rear, hips, thighs...love it!",1332720000,4,607,4.1525423728813555
3723502,5,B001NW0QSK,"I have more than 100 exercise dvds including p90X, biggest loser, hollywood trainer, bar method etc., but I have not seen a dvd like Ilaria's. She is amazing, poised, in control, NOT  a bit ANNOYING, and suberb.  The workout is quite challenging but result oriented. Ilaria does not waste time with small talk and gets you going with the workout, ques and transitions perfectly. You do not feel confused and fall behind. I feel like I get a nice workout by just watching the dvd. She knows what she is doing. Her body is super fit and she looks amazing.

I did not get a chance to fully complete the workout yet but, I can guarantee you that with reqular practice one can see incredible results - the workout might be a bit tough on the knees, though.

My hat is off to you Ilaria; you are simply incredible. Well done.",1312156800,3,819,4.403973509933775
3723503,5,B001NW0QSK,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Yet another great workout from Ilaria --- my favorite fitness instructor.

Same great formula with a mix of low impact martial arts, dance/ballet moves, and basic leg strengthening moves (lunges, squats.)  Great cuing, minimal music with strong beat, decent video quality.  I would prefer less people overall (ideally 2+instructor is perfect) but this is still good despite the larger group.",1289260800,3,447,5.434782608695652
3723504,5,B001NW0QSK,"I've been an at-home exerciser for years and consider myself intermediate to advanced and this DVD kicks butt! I'd never heard of Iliara before getting this DVD, but now I'm looking forward to getting more of her workouts! I've always been a ""pear"" shape, even exercising 5-7 days a week, but I've been doing this exercise at least 2-3 times a week along with workouts with weights on opposite days for about a month now and I've already gone down one pants size! I love the way she starts each exercise ""set"" and adds to it each time. The time seems to fly by as you try to remember what comes next (in a good, challenging way), but her cueing is also very good if you lose your way. If I had to say anything ""bad"" about this DVD, it would only be that you need to turn the volume up as the music can drown out her voice a bit and the ""cool down"" is not long enough, in my opinion, but if you walk around a few minutes afterward or march in place, you'll be fine. It's about 45 mins. long and by the end I'm dripping with sweat so I know I've worked hard. I highly recommend this DVD!",1284336000,5,1085,4.122641509433962
3723505,5,B001NW0QSK,"When you first start this workout it appears easy, but Ilaria ramps it up each notch that by the time you are done, you know you have worked.  This exercise will change your lower body, guaranteed if you put it in rotation at least 3 times a week.  Lastly, Ilaria is one of the best instructors out there, flawless ques.  A must have.",1281484800,4,334,4.26984126984127
3723506,5,B001NW0QSK,"I am again impressed with Ilaria's ability to craft low-impact yet effective cardiovascular workouts that are both challenging and form-conscious. This workout focuses on lower body toning, and since it is fast-paced, offers a sweat-pouring experience. Balance is also challenged in this workout, as well as coordination, since the combinations move quickly. The music is similar to her Powerstrikes 5 DVD workout, in that it is also fast-paced, techno-driven, and synchronized to the movements, which is helpful (although it can be annoying to those who aren't into that kind of music). Again, the music can be louder than Ilaria's cuing voice, but once you get used to the routine, this becomes less of an issue. Ilaria, as in all her workouts, does the entire workout with her crew and you, with hardly any indication that she's out of breath or struggling to keep up. She is truly in top form, and her body shows it. Her demeanor is very professional, low-key, instructive, sincere, mature, and straight-forward; she could put on a ""tough-gal"" act if she wanted to (a la Jillian Michaels), but instead, her high-quality instruction and modesty speak of her true professionalism as a martial arts and fitness expert. This is a great accompaniment to Powerstrike 5, and can be done in a limited amount of space in about 45 minutes' time. This is NOT a kickboxing workout per se, but does use some kickboxing movements of the lower body to the extent that they lend to lower body strengthening; so, if you prefer an actual kickboxing workout, I would highly recommend Powerstrike 5 instead. I would recommend this workout without reservation to anyone looking for a high-quality, fat-burning workout that is easy on the joints but challenging on coordination, balance, and control (almost like dancing!).",1280793600,9,1805,5.08080808080808
3723507,5,B001NW0QSK,I've been doing Taebo dvds since 2003. i finally decided to try this dvd. best $20 i invested. her workout is very effective. No offense to taebo but she doesnt spend alot of time talking. she gives excellent instructions very you move on to the next move. its at a comfortable pace and her reps are even. im getting ready to order her other Dvd. im an advanced exercise workout 5x a week and 2 of the days i use her dvd. each time i be sweating like i came out of a pool. 5 stars.......,1273536000,,487,4.083333333333333
8327976,5,B001NW0QSK,if you do this three times a week you can notice results in as little as two weeks:)  my favorite leg workout by far.,1486252800,2,117,3.875
8327977,5,B001NW0QSK,This is a very good video. Terrific easy to follow instruction. I like her style. Serious trainer. This is a great leg sculpting routine.,1475712000,,137,4.75
8327978,5,B001NW0QSK,"I am an avid fitness junkie who has worked out about an hour per day, 5-6 days per week, for years and have a multitude of exercise DVDs (e.g. Cathe, Jeri Love, Insanity, TurboFire, Tae Bo).  I also go to the gym a few days a week and do various strength training (e.g. leg machines with heavy loads).  This is my very first Iliaria DVD and let me just say, I love her!  She is no-nonsense and won't let you off the hook, but also exudes a warmth and compassion that is very appealing.  And I won't even get into her physique...suffice it to say that she is as ripped as they come!  With the amount of strenuous activity I have been doing for so long, I was skeptical that doing her workouts would make me ""sore"" in new places, as I believed I was working all of my abdominal and leg muscles.  Well...I stand corrected!  The first time I did this workout (I also have Bodystrikes Vol. 2 which is also amazing) I woke up the next morning really feeling my inner thighs, glutes, and abs.  This was a fantastically pleasant surprise!  I have now done this workout and Vol. 2 a total of three times and am still feeling it the next day.  I really love her approach: low impact strength moves that really bring your core and lower body muscles to complete fatigue with relentless repetitions and no breaks.  The high-rep and no break factor is what really gets your heart rate up (and keeps it up) therefore providing an added benefit of cardiovascular activity.  This is really a one-stop shop program for cardio and toning combined.  Other than some push-ups in the warm-up, you will not get much in terms of upper body work, but if you add weighted gloves you will feel your arms, back, and chest the next day.  I really love Ilaria and have already purchased my third DVD from her collection (Powerstrike).  It is arriving today and I will certainly post a review once I have tried it.  Thanks, Ilaria, for the fantastic cueing and butt-kicking workouts.  You have obtained a new fan!",1463011200,3,1983,4.448753462603878

8327981,5,B001NW0QSK,"If you're looking for great leg workout, then this is what you need to buy. This was the first dvd I bought of IIaria and I'm definitely a believer. This dvd has you doing squats, lunges and kicks. She breaks up the workout and makes sures you know how to do one movement before moving onto the next move. Then you repeat everything you have learned with the new move you just learn. I got this dvd a week ago and have used it 3 times. It's definitely a new staple in my workout routine! I plan on checking out some of her other workouts.",1428710400,2,538,4.133333333333334
8327982,5,B001NW0QSK,Great!,1410739200,,6,6.0
8327983,4,B001NW0QSK,gives good ideas about mixing up cardio workouts and adding variety.  Can turn cardio into fun and makes time fly,1399680000,,113,4.65
8327984,5,B001NW0QSK,This video will remain challenging to me for quite some time. It makes my legs feel much better. I'm only through the first 3rd of the video and tenuously moving into the second 3rd of it. I'm not a fitness freak but I am starting to challenge myself to stay fit and this video is a great second level. I started doing 10 mins workouts and moved to 25mins and now im working my way up this 45 min work out. It focuses on lower body only ..which is fine because I use ABS & PUSHUPS PLUS DVD with Ilaria Montagnani for upper body.,1397865600,,528,4.086538461538462
8327985,4,B001NW0QSK,"I say interesting because it is, Ilaria's bodystrikes dvd it's very hardcore and can wore a person out because of the reps you have to do. Though it will help tone and reshape your body, I have a couple of issues with this dvd. For one, the warm up is a tad too long, if you didn't know any better you thought the warm-up was the exercise till later on when she cues you for the ""official"" workout, the second problem is that she does make you do a lot of squats and side kicks. Which for the most part i have no problem with, except that the hip flexors and quads takes a beating. If you not good with technique and doing it fast but in control movements this dvd is definitely not for you. And in all do honesty, no beginner should ever use any of ilaria's exercises. You end up hurting you self more than actually helping yourself. But regardless of these factors, this was a superb exercise dvd. Definitely recommended.",1358380800,3,923,4.310344827586207
