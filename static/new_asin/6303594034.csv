7851813,1,6303594034,It was sent fast got it right away. This video was try rember the start on MTV. No problems watching it,1279584000,,103,3.9523809523809526
7851814,5,6303594034,"For those of you who only have fond memories of Toby Huss doing Frank Sinatra or that crazy Go To Hell guy, or Donal Logue doing the crazy cabbie Jimmy McBride... here's your tape. Though they didn't include all of my favorite commercials, seeing some of them was nostalgic enough. I can't find any of this stuff online!

Hey, for a couple bucks, who cares how much stuff is or isn't on the 40 minute tape.",1134864000,,406,4.342105263157895
7851815,5,6303594034,"This is quite a find... admittedly I got it for really cheap elsewhere, but the Toby Huss/Sinatra impersonator spots are pure gold.  And of course, Donal Logue as Jimmy the Cabby is great fun, too.  Worth checking out if you can get a good price...",1032307200,3,248,4.488888888888889
7851816,4,6303594034,"I always thought the best part of MTV was the little bits between ( back then ) videos -  Here is a nice collection of them going all the way back to the early "" I Want my MTV "" bits with Cyndi Lauper and Billy Idol, Randy and the Redwoods, up thru the Sleazy Cab Driver.
 My only complaints are that it isn't long enough - and that makes it cut out some of the more interesting bits of the recurring characters.",1013731200,,412,3.9518072289156625
