3549728,5,B001ECRAVK,"At first, only a few titles intrigued me.  But after watching all 4 volumes, I'd say that only 1 or 2 of the movies didn't settle too well, and none of them were so bad that I couldn't finish them.  Over all, the quality is high: acting, music and stories were all good!  And for $50, one can't go wrong!",1239235200,9,304,4.033333333333333
3549729,5,B001ECRAVK,"came really fast in the mail. I started to watch the second season and man these are the best horror movies out there, so i had to get the rest of them",1233532800,3,151,3.75

8297723,3,B001ECRAVK,"These are much cheaper bought individually. I bought the set at Fry's for $2 each. I still see them there, so if there's a Fry's in your town, you can get it instantly.

The movies are okay storywise. Some are a little hokie, some are pretty good. They're not cheap knockoff type stories. One actually takes place in the same universe as 'An American Werewolf in London' (just by reference, not really a sequel), which I thought was pretty nice.",1417737600,,445,4.5625
8297724,1,B001ECRAVK,"Well let me start off by saying I love the series, but these bluray copies are shit, I see now why they didn't make season 2.
They don't work on my computer or my other 5 bluray players (region A). My PC can rad and open all of they 65 blurays I own but these. I wish I never bought them.",1373760000,,288,3.737704918032787
8297725,3,B001ECRAVK,"First of all, this is a great series, and I find myself re-watching a lot of the episodes multiple times.  I was also disappointed when they quit after only 2 seasons.  That being said, is there a benefit to buying this version as opposed to paying under $30 to buy the 4 volumes separately?  Perhaps I'm missing something?  If so, could someone please let me know what that is?",1351468800,5,378,4.434782608695652
8297726,5,B001ECRAVK,"Don't expect to be frightened to death or held in suspense but do expect some enjoyable and sometimes ridiculous short films.

The quality of the blu-ray is stellar and its great to purchase a full set all at once rather than one volume at a time.

These movies are perfect if you enjoy sometimes cheesey and ridiculous movies but that are put on with a quality budget and generally, a good cast.

Perfect movies to plop in and drink a couple beers while watching with some friends.",1326412800,3,482,4.517241379310345
8297727,4,B001ECRAVK,"This ran only two seasons before it got the ax. Then we only got season one divided up into four seperate blu rays. It should have been one box set of the whole season but they chose this method and this is what we were stuck with. The stories range from scary to bizaare and even slightly humorous. They look great on blu ray and hopefully someone will put out season two on blu ray. In fact there's enough space on blu rays to add some of the third season that was called 'fear itself""
which was a regular tv show and not a showtime effort.",1301788800,,542,4.122641509433962
8297728,5,B001ECRAVK,"This was the first Blu-Ray movie purchase I ever made and I am glad I did. There are some homerun stories in this set with great actors my favorites are ""Jennifer"" and ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"", but the there are a couple others that are good just don't stand out to me as much. The picture quality and audio are amazing. All I am waiting for now is Season 2 to be released. I hope they reboot the series because it was missed by many and is a hidden gem for all fans of horror.",1299715200,2,490,4.010204081632653
8297729,5,B001ECRAVK,"Some of the best horror movies I've seen, and great stories as well. Video quality has the look of about 720p, but still very watchable with little grain, and good color. Writing and directing varies, but is typically on par with a large production movie. Actors are very good and professional. IF you're looking for a series of straight gore (there is some, but not usually gratuitous,and frequently non-existent) or torture movies (AKA Saw) look elsewhere. It's the stories, directed well and acted believably that makes you squirm for the people in the movies or give you OMG! moments. Weigh this, and the fact that you're getting about 12.5 hours of quality horror.

I WISH they'd come out with Season 2 on BD!",1288137600,,714,4.804878048780488
8297730,2,B001ECRAVK,"I thought this was going to be a good series, it is not. Most of the stories are not scary or gory at all. I was very disappointed and will not buy any more of this series.",1277337600,2,172,3.675675675675676
8297731,5,B001ECRAVK,"To compare this to anything, you'd have to say Twilight Zone. its got great intriguing stories with some great people starring. amazing stories!!",1267056000,3,145,5.3478260869565215
