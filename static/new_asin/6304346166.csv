845811,5,6304346166,"I think that this film is rich in the sense that the directors tell the audience straight up to where some aspects of where our society and culture is heading and that we shouldn't leave our children be in such a sensitive  and under developed stage where they become ferral and raise themselves to  accomodate for their own everyday lives.  The last thing that fitzpatrick  says that when your kid there is not much to do and when you find something  that you like you shoot for it, which it was that he did which leaves him  with such a bleak existence.  This film is spectacular in that it is a  message to us and that I think that however weird and odd it seems it is  very clear.",916531200,,684,4.24031007751938

845813,5,6304346166,"As a teen, I totally related to the movie.  It was an eye-opener to see that sex, drugs, and alcohol aren't all that cool.  I watched it with a group of friends,  and I was the only one that thought of it as a wake-up  call.  I would recommend to your teen, but only if he/she is very mature.  I think this is a wake-up call to everybody,  because teens really do go  through this stuff in life, no matter where you live.  An excellent movie.",916272000,,442,4.046511627906977
845814,3,6304346166,"A well devoloped but irresponsible movie, I was angry when I first watched it.  I couldn't believe what these 'kids' were doing and the attitude they had about it. Whether it was teen sex, alcohol, drugs, lying to parents, or  viciously ganging up and beating on people, the kids had a no-consequence  attitude that scared me.  The documentary/home movie style filming gave it  an absolute realism to the characters.
It's not what I consider  educational, and no child should ever watch it (I saw it at age 21). To its  credit, however, it intrigued me so much I ended up watching it again.  I  admit that it keeps your attention like almost nothing else, and that's why  the three stars.  One star for the message it sends (unless you're  mature  enough to see through the superficial behavior by the end).  Five stars  because of its originality and ability to hold your attention in disbelief  of what you're watching.",914198400,,921,4.734177215189874

845962,5,6304346166,I am 22 years old now. However I wish I would of seen it before like at age 14. This movie is very powerful. It has a lot of sex talk and I mean in ways you don't want to hear it. However if you have young kids I recommend it. It shows girls how boys talk and shows girls what's pretty in the outside ain't pretty in the inside. And also don't fall for words and how getting extremely high off drugs can lead to something horrible,1480377600,,430,3.897727272727273

846091,4,6304346166,"Well, this would have been a shock back then, but now? Things change pretty fast and now we see many scary things about kids.
We see kids making porns with their own hands and spread in websites and that was even back in the end of 20th century.
This movie was made back in 1995 which is pretty rusty now but still seeing how the boys only interested in girls about using them as fulfill their sexual desire and that only. They even rape the girls who are totally unconcious drunk or sleeping totally tired. They really don't care how they feel or what their furure will be whether they will be pregnent later or will have some kind of sexual decease or something.

There is this one scene when this boy is raping this girl who just got a test and receives the report that she got AIDS and goes to the party and totally tired and falls asleep in the couch and this boy rapes her in her sleep. He for sure will have AIDS too. Very scary moment but also he desereved in on the other hand.
But again who is to be blamed?
What did all the teachers did in school? Just took all the money from the government and play? What is wrong with this country called America? Land of dream?
And what about drugs? Are you guys asking for more freedom using drugs? Good idea guys. Ruining your life.
I had chances to live with drugs when I was a kid against my will and couldn't get away from it for some time and now I never touch it anymore.
It's a nightmare.
There are some things that you shouldn't do in life .
 Being promiscuous, do drugs and so on.
Now being as a kid, that's a whole different story.
When grow up, there's a lot of time to be corrupted why now in their golden times?

These kids have no one to take care of, say some things that will be helpful to them.
They have nothing to do but have sex or searching for girls to shoot their sexual desire and get done with it. And then some more drugs and lost their agony. Living in a dream world.
There's no need to think about the future cause there is none.
What if when they grow up?
They will end up with using the government money on the street no house bunch og unwanted kids haning around them uneducated wasting their life doing nothing no job.
Is that what they want?
Then again who did told them all this?
No one.
It is all adult's fault.
Where were they when they need one?
All they did was when the kids asked for money they said I don't have one, when will you come back home? They didn't even asked where are you going.
In Korea parents are so crazy about education they practically use all the money for education and suffer from mortgage. I might say what will they gain from it? Will they grow up and pay back from their effort? Na.
But then again, at least they tried. They didn't abandoned their children. They, like compete with other parents, took care of their child.
Wake up America.

KIDS is about a girl who gets aids i love how the movie is not made by a idiot who thinks its just for gay people especially in the 90s when it was a new subject! the movie is comedy at first but ends up being a super sad movie towards the end and you will not unsee the movie ever. i love KIDS but i give it 4 stars becasue its nothing special its only an hour and a half of sex and drugs and has little meaning till the end and most people won't be able to get there so thats a huge issue! otherwise great movie though i love it!,1447977600,,649,3.7794117647058822

846240,4,6304346166,"Only giving this movie four stars because I wanted to see someone die towards the end. That's how much distaste I had for the characters. Granted the acting was absolutely flawless. Kids is one of the most authentic movies you will ever see. Everyone was perfectly gross and reckless. Although I've never experienced any of the activities in the film, I always knew where the scene was at and where to find it. Kids portrays a clear view of how self-destructive adolescents can be. Thank goodness for women's clinics and places like Planned Parenthood where people can get tested for HIV/AIDS.

After further research I learned that many of the characters in Kids were played by actual adolescents from New York City and were into the skateboarding scene. Justin Pierce (Casper) and Harold Hunter died young before getting any more significant movie roles. John Abrahams, Leo Fitzpatrick, Rosario Dawson and Chloe Sevigny have moved forward with their careers. Other lesser known characters Billy Waldman (Zack) and Jeff Pang (as himself) become professional skateboarders. The others are pretty much non-existent acting wise and you won't find any information of them online.

As a fan of Rosario Dawson, I was happy to see her debut in Kids. She's always been so humble and charismatic on screen. I just wish she wasn't typecast so much as a home-girl, but I think that's what the movie industry loves about her aside from her natural beauty. Interesting to note that she was discovered in New York on her front porch by photographer/screenwriter  Harmony Korine. She also had relatives who were HIV positive in New York.",1435881600,2,1623,5.003703703703704
846241,5,6304346166,"One of the best, shocking movies I've watched. The raw grittiness of how inner city kids would band together in NY when they had nothing to do in the 80's and 90's.  You see a melting pot of colors which is very much how NYC's population is.  NYC has changed a lot since the move was filmed over 20 years ago.  Times Square and it's flith and griminess is gone, replaced with Disney and big lights.  But the film still holds it's weight and hits hard with the carelessness of youth.  Sex and drugs ran rampant and is still an issue among today's youth. The term date rape didn't exist, but it still happened.  The world has become a lot more aware of using protection to prevent AIDS, but in Kids and the early 90's they rolled the dice and flirted with death.  I highly recommend everyone to watch it, because it's still relevant today.  In our society with social media, many of today's youth fall into the EDC (electric daisy carnival) crowd, pop Mollys, and have unprotected sex.  This movie was a wake up call to a culture that has existed since Woodstock in the 60's with sex and LSD and carries over to the present.",1435190400,6,1122,4.381642512077295
846242,3,6304346166,"This is not a great film. Pictures, lighting, costumes and plot are in no way astounding. Probably not a very big budget film. Yet in 1995 some started calling it a masterpiece. It was not and it is not and it will not be. It is at best a manifesto and a testimony. Even Andy Warhol was better in his Flesh series of films.

An underage kid, out of school and out of work and still taken care of by his parents is explaining us his philosophy reduced to a three letter word that he dares call love. He has no love for anything and anyone. He only has lust for the three letter word he calls love. It starts with one girl and it ends with another girl while the first girl is being taken advantage of by another boy while she is out of it due to some drugs. But in between, since this chap only takes virgins, the first virgin has been discovered and tested as HIV positive and the second who was tested negative will be tested positive afterwards, and since another boy takes advantage of the first girl he will be tested positive too later on. The lusty and lubricious boy is also an HIV spreader.

And that chap dares say he only has that three letter word he calls love and if it were taken away from him he would have nothing at all. And make sure you hear me properly. He only takes and fancies virgins, and of course only girls. He is deeply anti-gay naturally, since he is a natural cock though closer to a chicken than to an adult rooster. But I guess he can cackle all the same.

This vision of these young men and women all of them underage and all of them cheating one or two or more years, evolving and indulging in endless promiscuity, in never ending alcoholic binges and in perpetual drug taking, this vision is sickening but it is true to the marrow and the bone for a rather important minority of young people who are not able to find any stability in their own families. So they steal, even from their mothers, so they brutalize and eventually kill  who cares  those who stand in their way though the film only shows Chinese and blacks in such situation of the victims of these hooligans thieving and mugging and brutalizing.

These are the dregs of society and to show them without any kind of depth or humanity is more or less targeting the good society to show them how bad it could be if these were to be authorized up even only one rung on the social ladder. They deserve to be at the bottom and to stay there. Luckily for good society at the time, and still today, these dregs do not want to go up and they are satisfied with soaking in their own sweat and other bodily juices.

846290,5,6304346166,"I feel sick saying that I loved this movie- the reason why I gave it five stars was because, like American History X and other hugely disturbing movies that pack a huge freaking wake up call, this movie had me disturbed to the point of wanting to vomit and cry for up to a WEEK after I watched it. There was so much in this movie that should be commended and pointed out that deserves awards....
The directing was insanely amazing. The cast was so believable, I did not even feel they were acting. I was squirming in my seat with total sheer disgusting fascination, I was scared, and horrified by the images, (not so much how graphic visually they were, but because of the meanicing disregard for life) the underlying dread and the absolutely disturbing reality that this movie refelcted upon on the youth of the '90s kids (I guess they'd be Generation Y or the Millenium gen). What I want to say here is that while this movie was very hard to watch, it was super IMPORTANT.
Warning: This is NOT the kind of film you rent with a barrell of popcorn on a Friday night with your sweetheart or friends cuddled up on the couch to take a break from your week. It is graphic, it is disgusting and it is all done with a huge message- it is not for shock value or to be gratuitious in any way...it is not done for the sake of filler images or to just be funny or anything like that- unlike a lot of the stupid-ass teen films today- this film was a TRUTH movie- it was a sad, very sad commentary on the waste and disregard and the lack of sacred love for human life.
It is one of those films that kids might need to be forced to watch in highschool, but that would never happen due to the graphic nature of it. In fact, had I been forced to watch this in highschool, (in 1990-1993) I know I could NOT have handled it, I would have been even more screwed up and needed to seek dozens of therapists after seeing this movie. The images are graphic, the subject matter is horrifiying, and a warning, there is a sceen where the main character Telly sort of ""kicks"" a cat out of the way- nothing bad happens to the cat, but it was jarring, and telling of his sick personality.
That was only ONE of the horrific sceens in this movie. The absolute disregard and insensitivity for human life and reprecussions of ones actions are overwhelming in this movie. It is done in such a masterful and compelling way, that in ways, I guess you could say it is like a car wreck- you know how people have to see that kind of stuff on the road, but they don't want to look? That is what this entire movie feels like to me. And then, you see dead bodies and blood everywhere and a baby shoe or a teddy bear or something like that and you wish to God you hadn't looked.
The ending is a huge huge huge HUGE horrific shocking ending- at least it was to me and yet, it was the ONLY way to end this movie. I thought about it after- and alternate endings would never have served the kind of justice that this ending served.
Watch out for the last line, the very last line of the movie- it was utter and complete genius. I will never watch this movie again- even if you paid me $500,000.00 and offered me a years supply of make-up from Sephora.  But then, I wouldn't need to because I have the words of the characters, and the images permanently scoured into my minds eye now, even though I watched it over one year ago. So, if you can handle stuff like that, disturbing in violence, and sexual content and every other horrific disturbing thing, go for it. I am glad I saw it. It is a very important film. I respect the film makers and the writer for putting this out there, it is just a very very sad movie.
You gotta understand though, it is a filmmakers responsibility to shed light on the human condition. This movie did that. It portrayed a side of irresponsible and wreckless youth that would make anyone roll over in their graves if they were born in 1975 or earlier.",1428710400,,3935,4.253671562082777

846298,3,6304346166,"The content of Larry Clark's documentary-style ode to (one form of) cultural cancer, 'Kids' (1995), has been covered thoroughly in the surrounding reviews: parentless, soulless urban delinquents spreading AIDS and similarly destroying themselves for lack of anything better to do.  His directorial method is laudable and necessary, as the story itself is negligible and otherwise would have to be girded by phony theatrics of various kinds, something to the effect of an after-school special made by a pedophile.  But the problem with the film as it is-- aside from its inherently limited audience appeal-- actually stems from its anti-narrative, character-intensive structure.  We have on the one hand Jennie, bright and sharply acted by Chloe Sevigny, and, on the other, Leo Fitzpatrick's Telly, bug-dumb, gawky and clearly 'un-acted' to the point, paradoxically, of inauthenticity (compared to his nasty mates, the 'real' Telly would be pigeon-holed in with the special-ed crowd, ridiculed or ostracized by his peers, and certainly not by a long shot rise to become the Valentino of the group).

846332,2,6304346166,"Within the first ten minutes of watching this film, and being introduced to all these little a-holes, you quickly realize that there is not a single redeeming quality about any of them. It's not so much that the stuff they're doing is unrealistic, because I'm sure there are a good deal of kids out there who can very easily relate to Casper and Telly, it's just that they made me want to punch them in the face from beginning to end. These are the ""kids"" that get chewed out by drill instructors and sent off to boot camp on Maury Show because all they care about is sex, drugs, raising hell and ruining young virgin girl's lives. These are not the people I want to spend ninety seconds with let alone ninety minutes, these are the kids who deserve to get their ass beat like clockwork, but that's unfortunately who we're dealing with. ""Kids"" is a exaggerated, overrated film about foul mouthed lower class kids partying on the streets of NYC. It's the Refeer Madness of the 90's.

What I also dislike about this film is that it tries to convince the viewer that these are semi-normal teens doing what normal teens did in the 90's. This is NOT how all ""kids"" were twenty years ago in 1995. These type of teens did exist, but they were a very small percentage when it came to kids in general. This is not what normal ""cool"" teenagers did in 1995. Normal kids in the 90's were kids who loved Disneyland and watched new Full-House episodes. The kids in this film are the kids who came from foster homes and broken families and gave each other STDs with their spare time. These were the kids who grew up and are now adults in prision or simply dead.

846457,3,6304346166,"Those words in the title to this review were the first to come to mind when trying to think of words to describe this movie, however it must also be said that for many people this may in fact be a bit of a difficult film to watch all the way through.  There are scenes which were quite controversial in their time and which doubtless will remain so today.  This is a strong film which you won't soon forget.  It centers on a day in the ordinary lives of a group of almost (but I guess not quite) ""street kids"" in NYC, in the mid-1990's, within the skater/punk type of subculture.  So to people who were born right around or after the mid-90's, this movie will obviously feel quite dated in many ways.  However, I would venture to guess that all of what is depicted in this film still goes on today; just with some different clothing styles, different music, and also now adding in smartphones and the internet to the mix as well. (Though in fairness I guess there might have been an early form of internet back in '94/'95 but it was the era of Windows 95 ~ and the social networking, general daily usage, etc, was certainly not as widespread and commonplace as it is today -- who knew what a text or a tweet was back then, or had a FB, or Kik'd, or snapchatted??).

 In any case, the material dealt with here is tough stuff, there's no way around it.  We're brought face-to-face with teen (underage)sexuality and promiscuity, teen violence and generalized lack of basic respect for society, HIV/AIDS/STD's, drug and alcohol abuse, and I suppose we could even throw issues like poverty and perhaps single-parent homes into the mix as well (eg, the home life of the main character Telly is briefly shown).  The acting is mostly solid and spot-on, to the point where you wonder if some of these people were in fact ""street kids"" just being filmed on a documentary sort of basis, or were they all actors.  Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly) did an outstanding job of creating an impossible-to-like delinquent; Justin Pierce who played Telly's buddy and sidekick was also in fact discovered while skateboarding in NYC.  He unfortunately did not act a whole lot after this film and hanged himself in Las Vegas in the year 2000.  Another first-time actor in this film is also now deceased; the skateboarder Harold Hunter who died of a drug-related issue and had played the character ""Harold"" in this movie.  The beautiful actresses Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson also turned out excellent roles here, both of them at that time still early in their careers.

  This is no ""Reefer Madness""; no case of uptight adults just being hysterical and overreacting to ""teens being teens"".  The threat(s) and problems depicted herein are quite real and still remain.  This movie is definitely worth a watch, as a social commentary and as a drama as well.  But it's really not for people who are under the age of at least 17, and in my opinion could have probably been rated NC-17 as there are several fairly graphic sex scenes dealing with apparently underage teens, images of underage teen drug use and children smoking, etc.  For the older viewer of whatever age some of the things depicted and the overall thematic material will likely be disturbing (probably most of all for those who are parents/grandparents, or aunts, uncles, etc).  Basically anyone who has kids they love that are growing up now.  We all hope for better for our kids or loved ones, and the ""wrong paths"" seem so readily available and easy to wind up on.  This movie only reiterates and magnifies that fact.",1375833600,,3553,4.6496
846498,5,6304346166,"So, tonight I finally was able to see the film that everyone has been talking about this year; `Spring Breakers'.  It's been a long time coming.  I should have seen it in the theaters, I know, but my life is far too hectic and busy to allow for that kind of thing.  When you have three children it appears that unless it's a cartoon, I don't get to the theater to see it (an exaggeration, but not a very big one).  I've refrained from reading very many reviews, mostly because I didn't want to spoil for myself what was bound to be the highlight of my cinematic year.

Right?

Before watching `Spring Breakers', I sat down to watch Harmony Korine's very first film; `Kids'.  While he didn't direct it, he wrote the screenplay at the ripe old age of 19, and so I was interested to see how these two bookends complimented one another.  I must say, watching these two films back to back brought so much perspective to both features and helped highlight the raw honesty of Korine's vision.  Despite being 18 years apart, the themes and even the way in which those themes are expressed and expounded on show the bleakness of youth and their culture and how little it has evolved over the years.

""Life is short.""  A taxi driver makes that statement to a grief stricken Chloe Sevigny in `Kids' and that very statement, while a very common one, makes itself extremely prevalent in both of these features.  The truth in that statement looms over every frame like a dark cloud that permeates every moment, every sequence, every nightmarish reality.  Harmony Korine is not afraid to exploit the darkside of modern youth, and finding fragments of apathy and ignorance to lace the development of character gives both `Kids' and `Spring Breakers' a chilling sense of honesty.

We hate for it to be true, but we can't deny that it is.

That is what makes these films so socially important.  They are not shy of social relevance, no matter how unattractive or uncomfortable it may be.  Watching either film, especially `Kids', is not pretty.  In fact, I squirmed during some moments and found my stomach tensing as certain sequences of events were unfolding in a way that made me feel almost dirty.  Korine doesn't sugarcoat a thing.  He lays it all bare for us to decipher and dissect.

With `Kids', Korine exposed the ignorance of youth in the way they viewed sex.  With innocence being wasted on a group of children thrust into life, wholly unaware of where it is going to take them, `Kids' is a brutal look at the effect that growing up too soon can have on an entire generation.  With `Spring Breakers' he exposes a more apathetic view towards life itself but showing the steady decline of morals and value of life as these young girls fall into a pattern of reckless abandon.  Together they paint a stark yet accurate picture of the very problem with society today.  Children are oppressed by the very image of immorality that corrupts the heart of pop culture and creates in them a complete disregard for life because to them they are invincible.  In `Kids', young Telly is blinded to facts by the fantasy idea that sex with virgins will keep him safe from STDs, while in `Spring Breakers' the girls fall into a video game mentality, even using that very inspiration for their behavior (""just pretend it's a video game, like you're in a movie"").

Littered with provocative and lived in performances, both films thrive thanks to the dedicated performances throughout.  James Franco, Selena Gomez, Chloe Sevigny, Rosario Dawson, Justin Pierce and many more lend their surprising talents to creating characters that feel far more than mere caricatures.

These are not easy films to watch and yet they are important because they expose something that many people are afraid to embrace.  Our youth are being polluted, possibly by the very films that are exposing that pollution (the controversy surrounding `Spring Breakers' alone points to the detractors to this very kind of statement piece) and yet adults are afraid to look that pollution in the face and work to clean it up.  Harmony Korine has seen that pollution, and he has given it a voice and, in the process, lent us his eye.",1375747200,,4173,4.706611570247934

846545,3,6304346166,"Although the majority of youngsters these days don't act like this, there are still a lot of them that do. Upon viewing KIDS, I was completely shocked. The dialogue is extremely realistic...I can easily compare the lines in the movie to real life conversations with friends. The cast is so perfect, and to add onto it, the soundtrack has a few really good songs. The main character named Telly (the ""virgin surgeon"") even reminded me of Alex from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in so many ways.

KIDS came out at a time when the HIV virus was much more common among kids than it is today. Nearly all the kids in the film have intercourse (or graphically describe their own experiences) and Jenny tests positive for the virus and the common sense is that she is not the only one among this group of kids who has it. Also, the kids do drugs...lots of drugs. Yet again, completely shocked by the rawness and reality of the picture. Among all this, there is a quite graphic beating on one man by a whole group of these young delinquents. Shortly following the beating, there is a huge party. This party scene really grasps the viewer's attention mainly towards the end.

Overall, KIDS is a must-see for all. The quality of the picture is rather low. It looks almost like it was shot with a handheld camera. Aside from that, it truely stands out as a brutally honest story. The party scene around the end is every parent's worst nightmare come true.

846593,4,6304346166,"'Kids' is straightly put, one of the most difficult movies you will ever be able to sit through. That is, if you CAN sit through it all. I only did because I already have such a desensitized nature so watching continuous crude and derogatory sexually perverse language and acts for 90 minutes isn't something that will really make me flinch, although I do admit, it did disturb me. I admit I only purchased this film and viewed it because of all the controversy surrounding it upon its initial release back then, and never actually got a chance to see it.

The film is captured in a documentary style, yet is a completely scripted and fictitious story. It is inspired by the behavior of many inner-city youths during the 1990's, and THANKFULLY due to films like this, and many other advances in sexual education for children, statistics do show that these days in 2012, teenagers are not as fleetingly irresponsible regarding their sexual safety as they were back then. Therefore, in a way, this film is not really all that necessary anymore, as in 2012, this film does not correctly portray the lives of what society used to see as an endangered youth of America in the mid-90s.

'Kids' tells the very simple story of a few sexually irresponsible and gravely immature teenagers. The movie follows them throughout what seems to be a span of 1 or 2 days during a hot city summer of what I'm guessing is New York City when school is out. The main characters are a boy named Telly and his friend Casper, who really do nothing but try and up their sexual conquest with various girls they are friends and acquaintances with. We open the film with Telly as he is sweet-talking a very young girl (who is probably about 12 or 13), and proceeds to have sexual intercourse with her. Right off the bat, I would imagine many people shutting the movie OFF within the first 5 minutes, as watching two teenagers have sex in a film is downright disturbing to say the least. It is a fairly long scene that lasts a few minutes. Yet we know nothing about this boy Telly and at first the audience will buy into everything he is telling this young girl. Now as Telly walks out and sees his friend Casper, does the non-stop flux of crude sexual language begin, and literally DOES NOT END throughout the entire duration of the film. We see scenes of them and their friends, talking more trash, smoking cigarettes and pot, drinking, etc. We also catch a scene of a group of teenage girls whose sexually derogatory language is just as bad as the boys. They speak of their own sexual conquests and even though they admit to being mistreated, they shockingly seem to take pride in such behavior and disrespect of themselves.
Keep in mind that the language used in this film is very outdated by today's standards. Kids speak in regular ebonics to a very annoying degree. Yet, at the time, that's the only way lots of teenagers used to speak, as it was sort of the ""in"" thing to do. So yea, just a film where white teenagers are constantly tossing out terms like ""a-ight, yo, word up,"" etc. It's silly, but hey, it's what was prevalent back then.

The real plot begins when 2 of these girls decide to take an HIV exam at a local clinic. One girl I might add is played by a young Rosario Dawson, in what is perhaps her first ever movie role. No, she is in no way cute in this film even though she is very young, her sexually disturbed character will pretty much kill any charm she might have had. Anyway, it turns out that her and her friend Jennie both test differently for the disease. Jennie is positive, while Rosario's character is HIV negative. This is ironic considering that in the film, Jennie has only slept with 1 boy, and that is our main male lead Telly. Rosario's character on the other hand has had about 10 different partners, yet is completely clean. So after this Jennie decides she needs to find Telly and tell him about her disease, and to also inform him that he is also HIV positive. Yet though Telly does not know he has this disease, he continues to sleep with as many girls as he can, and makes a big deal about only going after virgins.

As we follow these characters throughout the film we don't really learn much about them, yet the film really holds up simply due to the character's graphic behavior. In the infamous fight scene (which surprisingly enough gave this a non-rating, even though the rest of the film could have very easily done that... the fight scene was probably the cleanest scene in the WHOLE FILM considering the stuff these kids pulled) we have the group of friends beat a man senseless due to a petty argument because Casper accidentally bumped into a guy at a park while riding his skateboard. The man is beat nearly to death.

The film introduces some newer characters towards the end, young friends of Telly and Casper who are even younger, probably about 12 years old, and are on the very same road to sexual and behavioral destruction. It's simply way too sad to watch because we know these children will eventually ruin their own lives due to their own pride and foolish behavior, but seem to have absolutely NO parental guides or role models to follow whatsoever. The only interaction with any parents is with Telly and his mother who is at home with Telly's baby brother. Their relationship is sad and pathetic as they seem more like roommates than a mother and son. We also get a glimpse of Casper's perverted mind as he oogles at Telly's mother breastfeeding the baby.

Now when it comes to that night, all the kids want to do is party some more. In a pool scene we watch as a different young boy becomes very enticed by a young girl who is part of their friend group, and makes frightening advances because he wants a kiss from her. If things went far enough, we get the feeling that the kid would perhaps have raped the girl, but of course that didn't happen. The fear only goes to show how good these performances were, and as the viewer, you cannot help but become convinced by every single shot of it. The documentary style helps this feel so much more real than it really is.

Things culminate with a final party scene where our female lead Jennie gets drugged by a friend, and still proceeds to find Telly. Telly and Casper try for more sexual conquests, and lots of teenagers passing out and vomiting. Just an extremely sad scene that is effectively disturbing. One cannot sit and believe that many teenagers actually USED to act like this. The thought is so heart-breaking that children can be raised and ignored in society so much that they build a life on looking for only fleeting pleasures, and have no aspirations for themselves whatsoever.
So to not give anything away regarding the outcome of Jennie and Telly, the film ends on a low note, as a final rape scene puts the nail right in your heart's coffin, and we see how things end with just more implied hopelessness from these teenage characters. This truly was a very sad time for many of America's youth. You leave the film with a sickened feeling, about how people could be so ignorant, or could HAVE BEEN, so ignorant towards children as to not lead them in a better direction. But then you remind yourself, hey, this is 2012, not 1995, children don't really have these types of behaviors to this degree nearly as much as they used to. They also don't speak the same way, as ebonics has thankfully been more or less ignored in regular speak in 2012 by many.

'Kids' is a very effective and disturbing documentary , but thankfully, it is also very outdated. While many will mistake the disturbance the film causes to be due to a poorly written and directed movie, many others will take notice that the reason the movie is so well made is BECAUSE of how disturbing it is. By the end, even though there is not much characterization, you still feel a certain something for the characters, and still have a heart for them. Because, in the end, they're just kids. So really, because this film is so relative towards its time era, it really isn't necessary anymore. Many who watch this now should definitely not take it so such heart, but instead do what I did - watch the film as an either an analytical piece, a piece of history, or just to see what all the hoopla was for back in the 90s. Just keep in mind that it IS disturbing, and offensive in many areas. So while it's too strong for many , others will no longer take this as the original life lesson it was first presented to be, but instead as a film where you just want to see what all the fuss was about.",1346198400,,8559,4.4926140012845215

846644,5,6304346166,"As someone the same age as the main characters, I recognize that this, first off, is a realistic movie. There's a caveat- I've never known anyone personally who has drudged through their life with the recklessness portrayed in KIDS. But contrary to the claims of many positive reviews, I don't see this as a cautionary tale for parents. KIDS seems a graphic presentation of hopelessness, a directionless agitation that's perhaps more prevalent in inner-city teens than in other kids. But no teenager is a stranger to the sense of emptiness and desolation that KIDS details, if theatrically. The kids you know probably don't behave like Telly. But whatever void Telly can only fill by deflowering prepubescent girls sucks away at all of us.

As for the graphic sex and accusations of child pornography-one reviewer claims the entire movie ""could easily pass for a kiddie porn film""-I think the hideous images are at once the most successful and the most sickening aspect of the movie. Sex to these kids is hardly the artistically shot, passionate whirlwind we're used to watching in films. It's quick, animalistic and, most importantly, dull. Watching the sex scenes hollowed me out; Clark manages to make us feel the same desolation that drives his characters to sex and drugs. If this is a movie for parents, its message isn't: ""your children are doing all this right now! Lock them up!"" It's: ""being a human is difficult and heart-wrenching. Being a teenager is almost impossible."" I recommend KIDS to any 16+ kid with a strong stomach and to any adult with an open mind.

on a side note: Rosario Dawson's eagerness, Chloe Sevigny's numbness, and Leo Fitzpatrick's doe-eyed villainy are fantastic. The acting was a huge selling point.",1275436800,4,1736,4.982758620689655

846647,5,6304346166,"More troubling than Kathy Bates' nude scene, Kids is a raw, voyeuristic look at the ever-decreasing morality of teenagers, sinking lower with each successive generation of degenerates.  Like a sucker punch to the stomach, this film shocks the senses and leaves a nauseating aftertaste, like the acid reflux of disgust.

Following the daily meandering of delinquents, cotton-mouthed Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and soullessly bankrupt Casper (Justin Pierce), an inside look at every parent's nightmare is provided.  Between massive sessions of drug and alcohol abuse, the two manage to squeeze in time for a savage beating at a skate park, breaking and entering, and non-stop parties.  The shock of this movie, however, is obviously its brazen look at teen sexuality, as Telly and Casper talk ad nauseum about their desire for virginal conquests, regardless of the ever-increasing danger of AIDS.  It takes the life-changing tragedy for Jennie (Chloe Sevigny) - one of Telly's former sexual partners - to expose the truly despicable nature of Telly and Casper's actions.  Welcome to the urban edition of Lord of the Flies.

The acting and teen life is jaw-droppingly realistic and accurate.  Every day, teens seemingly get worse and worse, and Kids amps it up quite a bit.  The sugar and spice of yesteryear is gone; the fly on the wall ate it, and puked.  I'm still sickened at not only the actions of Telly, but also by the thought that such a goofy, ugly, mush-mouthed kid could accomplish what he so easily does (which I'm positive happens in reality).  It's not just the morals declining; standards are dropping at an alarming rate.

The best aspect of this eye-opening piece is the introduction of two young stars: Sevigny and Rosario Dawson.  Their talent shines through, and causes a viewer to despise the actions of Telly and Casper that much more.

846686,3,6304346166,"Even though 'KIDS' wasn't as graphic as I feared it's still extremely disturbing and hard to watch. I think that's to be expected of any film that begins with a rape and ends in a double rape. Even with all of its disgusting situations, the film has a lot going for it. It serves as a cautionary tale about the life- threatening dangers of having unprotected sex. Plus, it features the film debuts of Leo Fitzpatrick, Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson.

Taking place over the course of a hot summer day in New York, the film focuses on two groups of teens. In the first group is Telly (Fitzpatrick) and best friend Casper (Justin Pearce). In the second group is Jenny (Sevigny) and her best friend Ruby (Dawson). Telly is the self-proclaimed ""virgin surgeon"" who delights in sharing the very graphic details of his conquests with Casper. The language in this film isn't just vulgar it's downright disgusting and in terrible taste. At one point, Casper jokes about his cousin having rough sex with a handicapped girl. Telly's goal is to de-virginize as many girls as he can. On this particular day his goal is to have sex with two virgins in the same day. Telly even has a victim picked out - the younger sister of one of his and Casper's friends. While Telly and Casper stalk the streets stealing, drinking, fighting and getting high, on the other side of town Jenny, one of Telly's previous conquests, accompanies Ruby to a clinic where both girls get tested for STDs. While Jenny has only been with Telly, Ruby has had unprotected sex with at least 9 guys. This makes things all the more shocking when Jenny tests positive for HIV while Ruby passes with a clean bill of health. A distraught and devastated Jenny sets out on all day and all night quest to find Telly and tell him before he passes on the virus to some other unsuspecting girl.

The film is shocking in its depictions of kids as young as 12 smoking, drinking, taking hits off pipes and having unprotected sex. There is a scene in a skate park where Telly, Casper and a large group of their friends, after scoring some grass, beat the hell out of a black man who yelled something at Casper. The  movie is full of these kinds of disturbing moments during which director Larry Clark lets his camera linger for unbearable lengths of time. 'KIDS' crosses the  line constantly and is often too much to handle, but it's admittedly well made and well acted. When the film was released in 1995 it may have been ""a wake up call"" as many critics claimed but over the years, with the increasing popularity of reality TV and other films focusing on teens, 'KIDS' feels somewhat tame. There aren't any new revelations when it comes to teens, who don't hold back,  experimenting with sex and drugs. Instead the film shows the timeless dangers of kids, often with low self-esteem, being extremely vulnerable to peer pressure and how deadly the consequences can be if they succumb to it.

It's a controversial movie, featuring extremely graphic yet causal conversations about sex, ten-year olds taking drugs, brutal gang beats, and rape. Though there's naturally subplots, the movie can just as easily be taken as a whole, a film showing the character's typical routines and experiences.

 At the center of the story is Telly, a pale, gangly boy with a ""addiction"" for virgins and who enjoys the act of deflowering them. His friend is the vulgar Casper who is as sexually deviant as he is, and the two regularly socialize with drug-dealers, gangster skateboarders, and all-around degenerate losers. One of Telly's previous girls, Jenny, discovers she has acquired AIDS through Telly, and urgently sets out to find him before he passes the disease to other girls whom he may coerce into intercourse with. Telly and his clique have their own criminal adventures, climaxing at a wild, drug-laced party while Jenny searches the city with increasing hopelessness.

This is today's American youth? We're doomed; this is moral implosion.

My generation, and we weren't particularly thoughtful or polite, used words such as: peace, please, love, thank-you, welcome. . .I don't think I heard any or those words here. (Sorry, ""love"" is used in the film, but only as a personal lubricant.)

These KIDS are subhuman. They beat; they rob; one--and this is his goal?--tries to claim two virgins in one day.

Quit moralizing, you might say; this is only a movie and these are only actors. But--really--this is a documentary. In the ending credits, Clark claims credit for ""original story"". But there is no story here; it's just kids let loose. (Sorry: 21st-century American kids let loose.)

If kids like this are our future, then we are all doomed! Maybe we will live in a futuristic, badlands world like in ""Road Warrior"". Forget global warming, maybe our youthful generation will end mankind. ""Kids"" follows the stories of Jenny & Tellie. Tellie is a teenage boy who craves sex with virgins. He craves it so much that he goes on his own personal quest to get as much virgin girls as he can. Jenny is one of Tellie's former flings and she has contracted the HIV virus from Tellie. Throughout the film we witness a gang beating (about ten guys against one), drug use, shoplifting from a store, stealing from a parent, a rape between two teenagers involving Jenny and a wild, alcohol party with kids as young as 10 drinking! The film ends as Jenny pursues Tellie to tell him about the HIV virus and possibly stop him from affecting more unsuspecting victims.

This is quite a shocking film induced to shock.  It has a redeeming realism to it because chances are you may have passed by ""kids"" like this on a daily basis. We can see kids like this in a mall, bus station, school or just by walking by. Maybe you just wish some of these kids will go away and grow up, but some cannot. Let this movie be a wake up call to parents. This movie can be a parent's worst nightmare. I think this is the type of movie parents & teenagers should watch together.

There is one scene that surprised me in the movie. In the subway, Tellie and his friend, Casper are talking boastfully about sex and profanity. A man with no legs enters the subway car and sings repeatedly ""I have no legs"". As he passes the two boys, they slump and stare quietly. Tellie's friend reaches for some change to give to the handicapped man. A single moment of humanity among many troubled and disrespected moments with these very troubled teens. Maybe all hope is not lost?",1209945600,,1996,4.7601156069364166
846778,4,6304346166,"""Kids"" was very controversial when it first came out 13 years ago, and it still packs a punch today despite the rise of the internet age and reality TV. This story of a day in the life of a group of NY teenagers is so gritty, so immersive in its delivery, that it really does feel like a documentary. After watching I was struck by the thought that this was the best ensemble acting performance I had ever seen. Not one of the actors (other than perhaps Chloe Sevigny) seemed like they were acting. They projected 100% authenticity in re-creating the carefree energy, immaturity, and menace of adolescence. As a film, ""Kids"" doesn't really succeed, but as a look inside the world of urban teenagers from the wrong side of the tracks, it is painfully realistic. If you are a very sensitive person it might be difficult to watch it all the way through, but if you appreciate fine acting and truth in film-making, give ""Kids"" a try. In terms of the DVD, the only extras are a couple of trailers. The lack of a commentary track with the director and the performers is unfortunate, but we'll just have to hope they put out a special edition one day.

The movie had a lot going for it, but I still vowed never to watch it again. But it just stayed in my head. When I watched it again a few weeks later, I didn't get squeamish at all this time around, the good aspects were heightened, and I really enjoyed it. This is great cinema, period. I have a very hard time believing that there was a script for this because the dialogue is the most real I've ever heard in a movie. Major credit to writer Harmony Korine (who also wrote and directed Gummo). Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pearce, and Chloe Sevigny give great performances as the main characters. True, this movie isn't for everyone - some people can't handle the fact that this is real life and not some fake suburban setting, so they'll just write it off as garbage. That's fine, they don't know what they're missing. I won't say that the film depicts the kind of life I wish I have, but it's great that a talented filmmaker like Larry Clark had the guts to show it.

846781,4,6304346166,"A minor classic, though flawed in its' inability to really provide clues as to why the stereotypically lost urban youth of today seem willing to take chances even the ""worst"" of previous generations wouldn't consider. AIDS, considered a modern day plague and one very avoidable for those who were not the unfortunate victim of a medical ""accident"", has no apparent meaning for Telly and Caspar, one not exactly college material, and the other his amoral and willing prodigy.
The location photography is in the best tradition of hard, gritty films of the early '70s, like ""Mean Steets"" (DeNiro, Keitel) and ""Born To Win"" (George Segal and Karen Black; Robert DeNiro in a small supporting role).
The scene at the clinic when Jennie learns she is HIV-positive is riveting to say the least. The Medical staffer tells it like it is to Jennie, who acknowledges the seriousness of her condition, but can't seem to manage her new responsibility in notifying Telly, or in making an abrupt change in her life style. She finds herself at another wild party and in no condition to block the advances of Caspar.
The film took a bold step in focusing on heterosexual transmission at a time when the bisexual or homosexual community was unjustly identified as solely responsible for the spread of this disease. The problem with using this movie as a teaching tool, however, is that Jennie is the only sympathetic character, among the ""older"" kids, who should know something about the risks of certain behaviours.

846785,4,6304346166,"While the content of most of the reviews here I skimmed is true, the kids in this movie are ultimately pathetic human beings and a good advertisement for not having kids you don't have time for.

The few instances of parents observed are the type that have no control over their own sad lives (Telly's pathetic chain smoking breast feeding single parent mom) and as such were in no postion to give their kids any worthwhile or even interesting goals for their own lives.

This movie is pretty much like Saturday Night Fever, only younger kids and minus any Tony with his undefined dreams of dancing to give it any charm.

The kids are all stupid and unoriginal hedonists who are probably parodying the missing adults in their lives, dringing, smoking and trying to get laid in awkward and stupid ways.

The girls in the movie all completely lack any self esteem and apparently any street savvy whatsoever, weird for NYC, as they all will apparently believe any line any loser teenage boy with nothing going for him will throw at them. The girls in this movie are all victims - of their own deficiencies and of the stupid hormone driven boys who prey upon them.

When I was in middle school and high school I hung out with a weird mix of geeks and druggies, both groups from the middle class through the poor (the poor ones all had to work to help support their family). Sometimes we would encounter kids like the ones in this movie (stupid, mostly lower middle class, pedestrian and limited mentally) and I can remember wondering sometime what their sad seeming lives must be like. This movie showed me and its pretty much as bleak and a waste of time as I imagined.

The execution of this film is also clunky, while some of the acting is good, though I suspect the actors may be exctly what they are portraying.

While there are certainly subcultures likes this - pseudo-sophisticated, selfish, and arrogantly fearless - I must admit that I doubt my kids hang out with kids like these or ever would.  Of course, there but for the grace of God go we all, but we listen to our kids, they enjoy achieving, and they are developing interests that possibly are pointing in career directions; they rebel, they experiment, and we talk with them.

So I don't think the sick kids here reflect much about the youth of today, except for a very small group.  Most kids understand basic limits, and it is our job as parents to make sure they do.

846852,3,6304346166,"Kids (Larry Clark, 1995)

Once all the furor has died down, Kids will be remembered as the movie that started the careers of Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson. Of course, it's been twelve years, and the furor hasn't yet died down. I'm a little confused as to why.

The story, though it takes Clark a while to get around to it: Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and Casper (Justin Pierce) are skate kids in New York. Jennie (Sevigny) is a girl Telly had had sex with in the past. She accompanies her friend Ruby (Dawson) to the clinic so Ruby can get an HIV test; Ruby turns out negative, but Jennie is positive. The rest of the movie is Jennie trying to track down Telly before he can sleep with anyone else and tell him.

First off: watch the movie with subtitles on. It won't offer a complete translation, but it'll probably help. Telly and Casper's dialogue is often unintelligible. It may lend credibility to the characters, but sometimes you have to sacrifice a bit of credibility so as not to lose your audience. (Interestingly, almost every male in the movie talks in the same odd patois; I can't remember a single female in the movie doing so.) Second, the pace here is all over the map; it seemed as if Clark were working entirely without an idea of pace until the main story starts up (which happens far enough into the film that it seems as if it's going to be a plotless slice-of-life flick for a while), and once the main story does appear, the movie wanders off into tangents that sabotage the pace even more. Parts of the film that should have been minor scenes to advance the plot are dragged out, while valuable character-building scenes are jump-cut.

I got the feeling I was supposed to be shocked by the ages of the participants, as well. First off, that's a gimmick at best, and a transparent one; second, are there really people who don't know what teenagers are like these days? (And ""these days"" is a misnomer-- it's been a long, long time since I was a teen, and we were like this then, too.)

It's not bad, and does contain some good performances, but it's certainly not the groundbreaking masterpiece I'd been expecting given the twelve years of raves I'd heard about it. ** ",1178841600,5,2191,4.52020202020202

Teenagers do incredibly stupid things (mostly revolving around drugs) and seem to enjoy wasting time (all in the name of so-called rebellion).  This kind of stuff has been happening since time began, and while it may be more explicit nowadays, it's still not that shocking.

I don't really know.  As for the film, I would have preferred Harmony Korine (the screenwriter of this film) to direct it.  He has a much better sense of art and cinema than Larry Clark does.  Larry Clark's directorial style (if you can call it that) is way too straightforward and really lacks in imagination.  The only scene that I found haunting was the final one, when an aria is heard (or an operatic song), and we see some beautiful camera work.

This movie should not be compared to Thirteen, because Thirteen is not nearly as shocking, graphic, or believable. It gets one star in my book; also the plot and the characters were quite boring to me.

Even though KIDS takes place in New York City, which is one of the biggest cities, this kind of behavior takes place everywhere..this is the truth. In fact, I was friends with kids like Casper and Telly in high school, which sort of made the shock value of this film significantly less for me. Reguardless, the AIDS situation is quite realistic in this movie. It definitely makes you think before your next endeavor with a sexual partner.

While watching this film, I felt that in many moments these `kids' were having a better time than I was. How can I compare sitting in classroom full of strangers, to skinny dipping with a bunch of good friends? These youth have a camaraderie together that is rare in my world.

These `kids' just happen to act on their overly sexualized and abusive compulsions; blatantly saying and doing the same things that I think about, but hide from everyone else. Beneath it all, they are not just an embarrassing cross-section of our society, they are human beings. They are not stupid. They are spirits like me who are trying to get by with the best options that we are aware of.

I have hopes of planting a missional church that proclaims Jesus in every relevant way possible. As it stands today, I am completely irrelevant to these `kids'. If I was them, I would not want to be friends with someone like myself. I am so far removed from their world there is no way that I could ever get `in' with my natural presumptions and civilized front. Reflecting on this film has helped change my view of them. However it is only the beginning, and not enough, because I still see these at risk youth as `them'.

My ministry must move beyond simply awareness of `them'. I cannot see transformation happening without real, intentional, friendship involved. My faith community must know them as fellow human beings on the journey through life. Their rampant sexual behavior must be gently won over with persistent and extraordinary love. Their violence must be overcome with a people with an even more violent desire; a community that would rightly fight on behalf of them for their futures.

The film was a snippet of what God sees every day, both on our streets and in our hearts. If these children are merely a reflection of my own humanity and God still chooses to give hope and a future to me, then I must choose to give hope and a future to these children.",1168214400,2,2562,4.6467991169977925
846916,4,6304346166,"Its would be hard to add anything to what's already been posted. There is one observation I'd like to share.

I live in New York City, and frequent many of the neighborhoods where ""Kids"" was filmed. While walking through one of those areas about a year ago, I saw one of the actors from the film. His appearance was unmistakable.

Keeping in mind that this movie was made in 1995, what do you suppose this guy was doing? Hanging out on the streets, getting high and drinking with other kids. 13 or so years later, and this is still how he lives his life.

""Kids"" isn't a drama; it's a documentary.",1167177600,3,597,4.36036036036036
846987,3,6304346166,"I did feel this movie was a bit weird to give as a Christmas present, after watching it, but considering I'd never heard of it, when I opened it, I was just a bit curious. It sounded just a tad depressing (how wrong was I????) to watch on Christmas Day, so I decided to watch it the next night.

What's ultimately shocking about Kids is how realistic it is. How many times have you seen a group of kids walking towards you, and crossed the road to avoid them? How many times have you seen a couple openly snogging at a bus stop and stopped to think, ""They're too young?"" How many times have you read in the press about the latest 12 year old getting pregnant, cos her boyfriend told her he loved her? Or am I just getting old? It could also be because I never experienced that when I was young. I was still playing with Barbies when the kids in this were out getting drunk and doing god knows what. What's also realistic is the language. I actually went to put the subtitles on whilst watching this, cos I couldn't understand a word the kids were saying. (I'm only 22!) And as it turned, there weren't any subtitles to understand Telly or Casper, so I had to gather as much as possible.

Telly is the main character; with a face only a mother could love, and has a thing for deflowering virgins. He also has HIV. But does he know? Personally, I didn't find the actor playing him that attractive, and he got girls into bed, by telling them that he ""liked"" them. At least they didn't fall for the ""I love you, now come to bed"" line. There are some attractive scenes of Telly at it in bed, with the unlucky girl. His best friend, Casper, doesn't seem to get the girls as much, at least, until the end.

Jennie and her friend, played by a really young Rosario Dawson, go to a clinic to get tested. No pregnancy tests are ever mentioned, but an HIV test is. And Jennie has it. The only guy she's ever slept with? Telly.

Jennie decides to catch up with him, to confront him, to do god knows what, but fatally, only just catches up with him when he's already found himself another virgin. She also gets caught up the whole nonsense, when she passes out drunk, and Casper, hungover (or still drunk) and horny, decides he needs a piece of her.

This should really be shown to any irresponsible parents out there. The ones who don't care about their kids, and care about their job/toyboy/favourite child etc. The parents who give their kids too much pocket money, which will ultimately be spent on cigarettes & booze, rather than a decent lunch.

It's probably not a good idea to watch this film if you're easily affected by this kind of thing. I couldn't forget about it, and a day later, am still thinking about poor Jennie, and ultimately, Casper too. The kids are set on self-destruction, and this movie shows how. Afterwards, I felt like I needed a cuddle, just some general love & affection. It's a really hard movie to watch and also a hard movie to forget about. It will probably haunt the viewer for the rest of their life, if they've got a haunt. The film needs to be taken seriously. Pick it up if you see it for a lesson in life, and how NOT to bring your children up.",1167177600,,3171,4.321008403361344

I would hope even they show it in schoolfor sex ed, this movie is a great one and the best of the least, and it would never get old.",1164499200,2,373,3.7341772151898733
846989,3,6304346166,"I agree with most of the other reviews for this movie so I don't have a lot to add.  It's raw, it's realistic, and it's effective.  It really is scary to see kids hurt themselves and each other the way they do and seemingly not even know it.  What makes both the film and reality so disturbing is that these really are kids, not hardened criminals but children who are in some cases still experiencing puberty.  The girls look like they only recently began wearing bras.  The main (and worst) character looks not so much like a completely depraved being as a skinny awkward kid like the kind you see on the street every day.  The truth is, he's both.  These kids commit crimes to rival those of the grown men, but with less understanding of what they're doing.  The movie exposes this mentality very well.

Of course it's only effective inasmuch as it's realistic.  I'm a suburban teenager and I don't do this stuff, but I went to high school.  In my limited experience, well, there's a spectrum.  Most kids aren't like in this movie, and most aren't completely innocent.  Some kids do bad things, but would never do them to this extent.  Some kids might have experiences like this, but only on on occasional weekends.  Some kids talk as bad as in the movie, but don't do it in real life.  The film doesn't show the norm, but it shows what's out there.

The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because I don't understand why this is hailed as an ""eye-opener.""  Haven't teenagers been accused of this kind of behavior all along?  I thought by 1995 teenage delinquency was pretty well-known and the fear of it was widespread.  Drugs, sex, and violence among youth have been issues for the past several decades.  I don't see how this film introduced any new ideas.  It just shows this behavior in practice, whereas for many people ""delinquency"" is just a concept that doesn't touch them.

I don't know if I can recommend this movie or not because it's rather unpleasant to watch.  Very explicit.  For some people, that can kill the film whether or not it's good or effective.  But if you want to get an idea of the underworld of the youth, this is a good movie to watch.",1160265600,,2164,4.470588235294118

When I visit clinics and hosptials with my students, we see children 12, to 15 (honor roll) infected with HIV, and AIDs, who didn't think it would happen to them. Our children are definitely into sex, and we as educators, parents, grandparents, aunts, whoever, we've got to start paying attention. No, we don't want them to have any sex. But they are!

There is no script to speak of, just watching them being themselves. One kid called Telly (about 15 or 16) who has AIDS (and may not know it) likes young virgins (12 to 14 year old girls). He's a predator with no conscience at all. Probably a sociopath. And his buddy Casper is a dumb punk who swills beer. He's just as bad as Telly.

I have no doubt that teens like this exist. They existed back in the '70s when I was a teen. I'm sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don't have children. Perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing. I'm sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too. And small towns. And even rural areas.

This movie isn't for the squeamish but if one parent watches and starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them.",1154736000,5,1048,4.369230769230769

Maybe things are different when a child is lucky enough to be brought up in a loving home.  Maybe the pressures to do drugs and have sex aren't as prevalent outside of an urban environment.  Who knows.  Regardless, this movie is very real.  Seeing it again now, at 31, gave me chills.  I was having some serious bouts of deja vu.

This movie is documentary-style fiction bringing the reality of teens, sex, and AIDS, right to your uncomfortable viewing pleasure.  The actors (these kids..literally) show us a world of unrestrained promiscuity that is at once shocking and crass.

I keep going back and forth with this one, asking myself ...""Could I show this to my own kids someday""?...  It's like asking myself if I will ever be prepared for a tragic car accident.

 I found it interesting that in real life, many of these teen actors ""lost their way"" after this film became an independent favorite.

Prepare yourself to enter a world of 13 yr. old hell.  If you can relate to the imagery, you will find it disturbing.  If you can't relate, you will find it disgusting.  Either way, KIDS is not to be overlooked-let this film stand as a reminder of how admirable maturity is.  If you can bear it, I highly suggest watching this film with your teen.

It really was almost like watching a documentary on a primate species, how the males and females gather in separate groups to chirp and chatter at each other until it's mating season.  Then they all get together in a big pile and have at it with whoever is handiest.

The plot?  A day in the life of aimless kids: virgin conquests, shoplifting, public urinating, drinking, smoking, getting high, breaking into a pool for a skinny dip, street fighting (complete with a brutal, perhaps deadly beating for a simple transgression), raves, public fornication, and one girl's discovery that she has AIDS.

There are two scenes that stand out in the movie, the first being when Telly briefly comes home, and his mother is sitting on her hinder, smoking, nursing her new baby, and watching TV.  She barely notices Telly is in the room, except to tell him to be quiet so he wouldn't wake the baby.  Parenting at its very worst, and you just know that little baby will grow up the same as Telly.

The second is the scene where Casper wakes up after the party.  He moves from the tub he passed out in, past his friend who is unconscious over the toilet, to the kitchen where he immediately drains the dregs of the leftover beer bottles and lights a cigarette.  He then goes on to take advantage of a girl who is passed out.  Wow.  Another morning in hell.

Larry Clark has done pretty well with Kids, though his work with 'Bully' was better, smoother, less raw while still being on the cutting edge.  The performances from Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly), Justin Pierce (Casper), Chloe Sevigny (Jennie), and Rosario Dawson (Ruby) are more than acceptable.  Clark certainly has a talent for bringing teenage angst and degradation to the screen, and for using brutal scenes to hone his dagger of truth home to those brave enough to watch his films.

It showed teenagers being out of hand, and feeling like they were above the law. Same here, and it's just a feeling of nothing got changed really over the last 30 years. The most disturbing scenes would have to be, and there were 3 of them:

1. The most horrifying scene of Telly having sex with the last girl, and how she was screaming for her life, but it wasn't in ecstasy he was hurting her terribly.

2. The part where Telly's gang beat up a black adult all because he looked at them the wrong way, and the gang beat him to death, and then they go for a swim party, and they're all in thier underwear. The girls were pretty, but someone not in thier right mind might get the wrong idea.

3. The final scene where Jenny finds Telly screwing the other girl, and this was after he screwed her, and gave her AIDS, and then Casper (Telly's Friend) gets his pound of sex by banging off on Jenny while she's asleep feeling depressed.

This is where both movies intertwine where the Kids follow the pattern of the adults. If kids see thier parents acting a certain way they will mimic. I know with my 3 year old I have to watch what I say otherwise when he becomes 13, and up I'll have alot to deal with as I see him going down a possible path of destruction. That's one door I do not want to open for him, so if I say something, and it's something I should not say in front of my son I have to apologize to him, so he knows that we all slip up, but not to use the slip up as a ""COP OUT"".

He only likes to have sex with virgins and he is spreading the disease rather quickly. One of his victims finds out she has the virus and goes out on a hunt for Telly to tell him.

Alcohol, Drugs, Sex, HIV are all risky behaviors that is present in this film and no one has the common sense to say, ""Hey! This is wrong!""

It was also, I believe, Chloe Sevigny's first film.  And she is terrific.  The rest of the people in the film are amateur actors and Larry Clark's first film feels like a student film.  But somehow, it comes off as artistic.  I think the mistake people made is that this was some sort of ""warning"" or ""life lesson"" film.  Larry Clark just thought it would be a good theme for a movie; to take a different route to explain teenage behavior and how the adult world continues to misperceive them.  As for taste, the film is more voyeuristic than pornographic, and to tell you the truth, it's lost its shock value over the past nine years.

I think that every parent needs to watch this movie and others like it with any children that they have over the age of 16 and then listen very carefully to what their kids have to say after viewing this movie...who knows, they just might learn something about their child and the adolescent world they they all currently have to grow up in.

You can just sense that almost everything that occurs in this film despite the slightest creative license has most likely occurred in real life and the convincing acting of the teenagers who look the part (Not looking like they're 21.) really justify that. A perfect example includes a scene where teenagers mock a smaller kid because he hasn't been laid amongst other scenes.

While I think it's brilliant in its depiction I just can't give it five stars because quite frankly I really wouldn't want to see this again. I understand it's not meant to give any answers and just be a voyeuristic look at a failed generation but it's so grimly realistic that it leaves the viewer bitter and disgusted with no sense that a kid can turn out being anything but a degenerate, the film gives the impression it's a tad too late.

However I think EVERYONE should see this before they start a family as it'll either make you hate teens or show that we've got to clean up our act if we intend future generations to grow up with any sense of conscience and moral decency, ESPECIALLY in economically struggling and socially broken homes.

the actors/actresses in this movie are relatively unknown to me. i have never seen them in any other movies that i can think of off the top of my head. that just added even more to the realism of the story. all the characters are like people other people really know. about half the people in the story i could see replacing with my friends because that is how they act. all the conversations they held were just like the conversations me and my friends had back in high school.

this movie is a little graphic, but that is how it is supposed to be. that is how it catches peoples attentions. if people say that this type of stuff doesn't really go on then they need to get their heads out of the closet for a second and look around.

overall, this is one of the best movies i have seen in a while. it is one of those eye openning movies that you really can't unsee, but you wouldn't want to. i don't recommend this movie to anyone that is easily offended to an extended dirty vocabulary, but i do recommend this for just about everyone else. from the looks of it, this is a movie that you will either love or hate, not too much in between. chances are you are either gonna like the way you can relate to a story like this, or you are going to hate it because it stereotypes delinquent adolecent kids, or for the way they did the camera shots. i loved the movie for all these reasons.",1096416000,3,1658,4.175
847263,1,6304346166,"This was a very big letdown.  With all the controversy surrounding it, I was curious to see what it was like.

It was attempting to use the shock value of showing all the adolecent stereotypes in order to give some sort of cautionary tale of todays youth, in the end though it doesn't really work.

They take a large number of stories of delinquent kids and follow them around for the day.  One of them has a thing for deflowering virgins, what he doesn't know is that he has AIDS as he goes on to his next conquest.  His friends wander around the town, skate, steal alcohol, get into fights, and try to get laid as much as possible.

Two problems that I had with this movie.  Even though it was using graphic language and more graphic scenes than most movies, it just wan't that shocking or interesting.

I think that might be due to experiencing a lot of the stories in High School.  The guy that has to go around and get laid as much as possible, or a guy that likes to deflower young women.  The group of kids that wanders around shoplifting and partying whenever they get the chance.  etc......

Second of all, none of the actors had an ounce of charisma.  The main character not only came off as extremely stupid, but ugly as well.  Being neither suave or good looking it is hard to believe that he would be so talented at his hobby.  The fact that he talks like he has either a head injury, suffers developmental problems,  or is addicted to qualudes makes it even harder to fathom.

His friends suffer from the same problems; dull, poorly acted, unrealistic, etc......

This is a movie that tries very hard to shock, too hard.  I think this is what destroys the plot which could have been interesting.  But I think it also suffers from the problem of been there done that.  We have seen movies that are tales of what kids are capable of for years; Blackboard Jungle, Class of 1984, Bad Boys,  A Clockwork Orange, etc......  So this is old territory, and he might be able to get a new spin off of it, but wouldn't delve into new grounds.

847310,5,6304346166,"First off, ""Kids"" is a phenomenal movie in absolutely every respect.  Harmony Korine's script is amazing (I can already tell I am going to run out of superlatives.)  It blows me away that someone so young could write something so self-assured, so masterful.  The performances are impossibly real.  Add to this Clark's voyeuristic, documentary style and the result is some of the most uncompromising naturalism in cinematic history.
Kids is the kind of movie that makes mainstream filmmakers blanch.  It is also the kind of movie that makes mainstream film goers confused and angry.  Naturalism has never been a particularly popular style of theatre.  If a viewer doesn't have an appreciation for the style, he/she may think the film lacking.  Naturalism depicts life objectively, imposing no value judgements.  The question of value is left up to the observer, the viewer.  It does not shy away from ugliness or uncomfortable situations.  Naturalism is often seen as nihilistic, but that is the challenge that is presents.  Being truer to life than other dramatic forms, it's meaning is more obscured.
Many have interpreted ""Kids"" to be a ""wake up call"" concerning the growing menace AIDS poses to young people (I think it was even printed on the box cover.)  That is one interpretation.  I see a much more sinister theme at the heart of ""Kids.""  For me, AIDS just served as a metaphor for a diseased culture.  These kids are sick mentally and emotionally.  To me, these hopeless characters represent an entire generation of lost youth.  Their general apathy and animalistic hedonism is a perfectly understandable response to the empty, violent, plastic, consumer/commercial culture that raised them.  Yes, they are contracting AIDS; but what about those that escape it?  What are they going to do with their lives?  Of course, this is just my interpretation.  The film itself remains objective and impartial.  In fact, I think Korine would disagree with me and that is why I love this movie so much.

847390,4,6304346166,"""Kids"" is one of the most controversial releases of 1995.  Its brilliant and daring plot earns the writers tremendous respect.  The inside look of a sexually active teenager, Telly, teaches many lifelong lessons about the dangers and the consequences about such lifestyles.  All of his friends influencing him and applauding him for his actions keeps the film interesting as it helps explores other dangerous lifestyles: drug use, violence, etc.  In the meantime, they explore another storyline: that of one of Telly's ex-sex partners, Jennie, who discovers she's HIV-positive.  Telly is the only sex partner she's had.  While she's trying to find Telly to share the news to him, he chases another potential sex partner.  Such combination offers a more intense movie experience and adds more twists and turns.  Obviously, the writers never held back any graphic details.  They share the scenes with the audience like no one is acting.  The camera work and the lighting add to the danger effect.  The lights shine brighter in most of the afternoon scenes, successfully offering a more graphic view of the characters' environment and a more raw feel.  Had they not done that, the danger feel wouldn't have been as heavily present.  Leo Fitzpatrick (""Bully"")wonderfully portrayed Telly, offering his own bad boy image into the character and to the movie.  His research about the expressed issues is obviously present.  Oscar nominee Chloe Sevigny (""Boys Don't Cry"") proves in her role as Jennie that she is one of the greatest independant movie actresses ever.  As with all her projects, her every drop of heart and soul is fully expressed through her character.  All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully.  ""Kids"" is a great movie for those looking for something daring.  This is highly recommended for parents to show their kids.  Few other movies show as much realism as ""Kids"".  Behind that, this is sure to please many audiences.",1075334400,2,1943,5.104761904761904

A Statement that the young in this country are left to fend alone in a cruel world, with predators and prey, with no referee.

This film doesn't offer answers, it reveals a world that most adults choose to ignore. These kids are on a collision course that is fostered by conformity, insecurity, poverty and violence. There is no easy solution, and to pretend that there is would be worse than useless.
As far as the acting is concerned, EVERYONE is superb. The ""documentary"" approach used by the director & cinematographer clicks perfectly with the realistic acting performances. Even though most of the kids are portrayed as repulsive, you can't help but feel for them. Instead of caricatures, we see insecure young people who are engulfed by a very destructive conformity to violence & extreme promiscuity..
I'm not saying that people aren't responsible for their actions. But, I think it's fair to say that anyone who could actually transcend an environment such as the one portrayed in the film who be a very rare individual.",1071705600,7,1068,5.03954802259887

847501,3,6304346166,"Kids has gained notoriety since its 1995 release for its controversial view on the life of kids today.  Some of the subjects that this movie covers are very real, indeed.  Praise should also be given to the casting director for this movie, Alysa Wishingrad, who was able to choose actors who looked very real and actually appeared to fit the part that they were chosen for--the role of kids.
However real they may have looked, there is just something about the performance of Leo Fitzpatrick as Telly that doesn't work.  He seemed to fit into the role far too well, and at times it seems that he is overacting the part as a cocky sex fiend.  For this reviewer, Telly just grated on the nerves after a few minutes.
Praise should be given to the late Justin Pierce in his role as Casper, as he no doubt was created to be a very likeable character, and he succeeded with flying colors.  In this movie, he appears to be the most realistic male kid on the cast, as many young teenagers could likely identify with the personality that Casper conveys.
As far as the females go, it should first be noted that Kids was the first role for both Rosario Dawson and Chlo Sevigny, who played the roles of Ruby and Jennie, respectively.  Sevigny's performance was stellar, as her emotions felt real, her plight was understandable.  She was given all the sympathy in this film, and she earned it with excellent dramatic acting.
Unfortunately, the performances of Pierce and Sevigny are outweighed by Telly, who overexaggerates his role and ultimately ruins the movie.  By the end of the film, however, things will have picked up, and the climax thankfully delivers a disturbing, yet satisfying ending.
The sad truth is that this movie is merely kids play (pardon the pun) compared to the things that kids are getting involved in today.  Still, the events that these kids go through seem very real, and they are very real.  All in all, Kids is a movie that should be seen only once or twice, to understand the controversy that this movie has rightfully garnered with its headon attack at kids' issues.",1071273600,5,2084,4.653950953678474

The story follows a clan of NYC youths through 24 hours of hell that is their adolescent lives. Crisp, stylish camera work makes it feel like a documentary. We learn a young women is one of many that is infected with AIDS. She turns to being innocent and partying with friends to forget her troubles.

Although the acting is very realistic for one dimentional characters, the story moves at a very slow pace. The movie is poorly written and there seems to be no real structure. Stuff just seems to happen, there's no real development or progression of a theme. It's just 91 minutes of doing random ""shocking"" activities. The violence is quite tame, and besides the fact that these characters are children, there's nothing very disturbing about their acts in that they have all been preformed hundreds of times on the screen. Robocop 2 had a much more interesting dynamic child character who was a major player in the underground world. If you had tagged on only a couple of years to the characters, this would be considered a waste of time. A good film shouldn't rely on a single detail to make a point.
If you're oblivious to the real world this film may come as a shock, but for most people it's pretty much common knowledge that under age kids will perform illegal acts. I found nothing shocking or surprising in the film. I think the only good feature of the film was that it didn't try to shove some message down your throat, but it was clearly trying to make a statement.

3- Good cinematoghraphic for a ""indi"" film.
4- Cool music.
Bad things:

2- Little kids smoking grass.
3- It doens't have a clear message against the drugs like in Requiem for a Dream.
4- The movie says that using drugs is a very cool and funny thing to do, it also says that no matter the consencuenses of making sex without protection is still a cool thing because is the way to be more ""MACHO"".
5- Dissappointing and incomplete ending.

Though some might consider that last statement a bit ""preachy,"" it is not intended to be. It is simply an observation of cause-and-effect. Why else would a kid like Telly (played brilliantly by Leo Fitzpatrick) be so obsessed with deflowering 13-year-old virgins? Why else would the lives of the other kids portrayed in the film be so deeply entrenched in the non-stop pursuit of heartless sex and reckless drug use? And why, through it all, would they be so completely indifferent and oblivious to the consequences of their actions?

Kids is a modern Clockwork Orange, but without the narrativity or theme; it a relatively dumbed-down and arguably irresponsible analysis of modern amorality.

847618,3,6304346166,"""Kids"" goes right to the heart of everything that parents fear will become of their children.  The youths that inhabit this film are not just wayward... they are violent, amoral kids whose state of evolution seems to have regressed to something more primal.  The male lead, if you can call him that, in this movie is a truly horrific animal named Telly (played with scary realism by actor Leo Fitzpatrick).  Telly seems to exist for no other reason than drink, get high, get into fights, and, oh yeah, deflower as many virgins as possible.  He cajoles his conquests by telling them exactly what they want to hear, and once he's accomplished his mission, he will have nothing to do with them.  He says he prefers them because they aren't all dirty or have diseases.  Yet, the irony is, he is unknowingly carrying the AIDS virus around and endangering his conquests because it would seem that one of his 'virgins' was not quite honest with him.  It's not hard to see how Telly can become such a monster.  He has no moral compass around which to develop.  One brief scene takes place during a brief stopover at his house before he and his friend, Casper, take off for more mayhem.  His mother is sitting in the living room, folding laundry and watching TV while being almost totally oblivious to Telly being there.  When Telly asks for some money, she says no and asks him when he's going to get a job, he just says that he's looking and then he goes into her room and takes some money, anyway.  She wouldn't know if it was missing.
  The actual plot of this movie, as thin as it is, focuses on a girl named Jennie (who was one of Telly's conquests) searching the streets of the city to find Telly and stop his virgin conquest because of the AIDS virus she just found out he gave her.  Her search is intercut with scenes of a brutal gang beating by Telly and his friends of guy who popped off his mouth, club kids engaging in animalistic carnal behavior, and a morally bankrupt party where kids as young as 10 are drinking up, getting high and participating in even more carnal behavior.
  ""Kids"" gets a positive rating because there is nothing phony about its unflinching view of the existence of kids with too much time on their hands and no direction in their lives.  It does not get a higher rating because the images are extremely graphic and difficult to digest.  This movie is not for everyone, but, if someone feels the can handle the subject matter, it is a valid tale.",1026000000,91,2475,4.496644295302014

847711,5,6304346166,"Okay, Kids often feels like a documentary. It's filmed in a very simple style, and the dialogue is so life-like that it feels unscripted. But it is scripted, of course, and the film is somewhat stylized. For all its alleged obscenity, it actually takes a fairly conservative stance. Casual sex is equated with AIDS, which of course is equated with death. It's a classic cautionary tale, just written and acted in a hyper-real fashion. Of course, that is what makes it so effective. This film probably did more to promote abstinence than all the sermons in the world.

It's interesting to note that, for all his amorality, Telly actually has a bit of the romantic in him. His justification for seducing virgins is that they will remember him as long as they live. There's something of the decadent aesthetic in that. And, as strange as it may seem, it's touchingly naive. In fact, it's the girls, not Telly, who are the most cynical about sex. Their conversation between themselves would have dashed all of his illusions, had he been around to hear it. It is a very perceptive, if unpleasant observation on the film's part. This sort of attention to reality is what makes it so compelling.",1023062400,5,1188,4.739130434782608

The movie is 24 hours of the life of teenagers in NYC. The cinematography is great, and its in a way like a documentry. Like all movies, you get into it, and follow the charecters, and i myself felt sad when Jenny discovers she is sick, all due to the stupidity of one boy, our main charecter, Telly.
Words cannot describe this movie. It is a must see. Although, this is not rated, i suggest that if people under 17 are to see it, for it to be used as educational purposes only. The movie contains extremely foul language, 3 sex scenes, and drug/alchol use.
The movie is trying to get the point across that Teenagers think they are invinciable, and all the stories they hear about AIDS are just stories, and it could ""never happen to them"", until it does. Carelessness,stupidity,ignorance all contribute to 5 charecters, in this movie becoming infected with the uncurable disease.",1022889600,7,1143,4.607843137254902

847714,5,6304346166,"I think this is the only time I was fooled.  Many films attempt to achieve a documentary feel within a fictional narrative.  Usually, they fail miserably.  ""Kids"", however, got me hook, line, and sinker.  I was amazed that director Larry Clark had managed to get seemingly unlimited access and unsparing raw footage of teenagers patrolling the streets of Manhattan.  I only found out later that the whole thing was an expertly made fiction (although there are some clues; I should have wondered how Clark got the p.o.v. shot of the kid getting beaten in the park).
The credit, I suspect, should be doled out in three equal portions.
First, Clark himself.  His cinema verite camera work is terribly effective.  Some scenes consist only of him setting the camera up in the middle of the room, and swinging around from face to face to catch bits and pieces of conversation.  An early sequence, shot in this way, contrasts what boys talk about (uh, sex and drugs apparently) with what girls talk about (more or less the same thing), in a way that never feels scripted or rehearsed, but also doesn't come across as amateurish or slapdash.  The casualness of the direction allows for the casual story to unfold.  It also allows those moments of high drama to stand out even more.  Witness the aforementioned scene in the park, where dozens of young skaters beat up one unsuspecting tough guy.  It's gruesome and brutal stuff, but Clark's camera never flinches.  (Later, someone offhandedly asks, ""Do you think we killed that guy?"", a question that's quickly brushed aside without a second thought, perfectly detailing the inherent nihilism that makes these characters so fascinating to watch.)
Second share of the credit goes to the actors.  A quick perusal through their filmmographies reveals no one had much more than amateur experience beforehand, and really only Chloe Sevigny has made any waves since.  But in the context of ""Kids"", they're all wonderful.  Leo Fitzpatrick, in what could have been a very unlikable role as Telly, is terribly charming when he needs to be, in a seedy kind of way.  His buddy Casper, a near-brain-dead space cadet with a mean streak, is perfectly essayed by Justin Pierce.  And Sevigny herself takes a wonderfully rigid, and then totally freaked-out turn as Jennie.  These are the three biggest roles.  But peopling the backgrounds are a vast menagerie of unknown actors and real-life street kids, none of whom ever strikes a wrong or false note.  Most striking is a group of boys who Clark focuses on for one long moment at a party: they're shirtless, stuffed four wide into a couch, and sharing a joint.  They are obviously much younger than the main circle of kids we've been following (presumably someone's younger brothers), and their brief appearance lets you realize that the people you are watching aren't just an isolated incident; they are a trend that will be followed for generations to come.
The third and final credit share goes to Harmony Korine.  Korine, an apparent child prodigy, was only 19 when he wrote ""Kids"".  It thus doesn't surprise me nearly as much as it should that he got the lingo and slang of teenagers just right.  The dialogue feels genuine and authentic.  The screenplay's greatest strength, though, is that it is fairly tight structurally, but the audience never feels like a story is being told.  It may seem at first like a mosaic of a movie, randomly put together around themes and not much else.  But closer inspection reveals a very strong, if hidden, narrative. Jennie finds out some bad news that she must tell to Telly.  She spends the rest of the movie searching for him, but is always one or two steps behind him.  Telly, for his part, is searching for something of his own: a new virgin to deflower (his randy/amoral little hobby).  The narrative stretches out over the course of one, hot Manhattan day, and even though there is no real deadline, Korine (along with Clark's direction) makes it feel like Jennie must catch Telly before the sun goes down.  In doing so, he/they give the film a thrust that an ordinary documentary-style would never be able to achieve.  And still, what could have come across as a ham-handed suspense thriller is, as written, more like a visceral slice of life.
And for those who think this film offers only a glimpse into the kids' world, and not a moral lesson, I ask you this:  What do you think will happen to Telly, Jennie, and Casper in the year after the movie ends?  I imagine their carefree days will be over soon, and the consequences of their actions will be felt full force.  It's quite a powerful film, if you think of it that way.  And even if you don't, it still moves you.",1018656000,9,4695,4.758961681087762

847716,4,6304346166,"Larry Clark's powerful film is about kids(obviously). The movie feels like a documentary. That's because the movie knows its subject very well. Early on after Telly(Leo Fitzpatrick) makes love to a young girl with shameless voyeurism he walks out the door to meet his best friend Casper(Justin Pierce). They begin to walk through downtown Manhattan on a really hot day. Telly talks about how he likes to [have sex with] young girls how he like to do it. They say it even as they pass by adults. Casper even takes a leak in the open in front of everybody. This first scene after the credits is the most powerful in the film. We realize that to these kids at least adults don't exist. If we look even deeper we pickup that these two have no curiosities, interests, values, ideals or rules to live by. They simply do what they want when they want. It is hard to listen to young kids speak like this but still thats the way many kids talk and act in America these days. We go on and see that these two are part of a larger circle of friends. We meet them mainly in Central Park. Here is another poignant scene. Casper gets into a fight with another kid in the park for running into him on his skateboard. His friends come and help him and they beat up this kid so bad that he nearly dies. Do they care no they even spit on him when there done. These kids are basically wild animals on the loose. They have no feelings no regrets all they care about apparently is [having sex]young girls and getting money from their parents. Larry Clark's powerful first film is right on one of the most disturbing i've ever seen in my life. It's also all true. Later we meet Jennie(Chloe Sevigny). She had sex only once with Telly but now she is infected with HIV. As for Telly he could care less as he tries to make love to two virgins in one day. She runs after Telly to save the next girl who he tries to make love to. Unfortunately shes too late. Eventually they all wind up at someones house where these kids makeout have sex, do drugs and other crap. Even young kids who look only ten are in on the act. Yes its difficult to watch but Larry Clark's film tells nuttin but the truth. It is difficult to believe that some kids go through this day in and day out but they do and they represent a failure at home church, school, society, and with friends. They would've been netter off being raised in an animal farm raised only to basic and needful instincts of survival.
 As for performance these are the most realistic i've ever seen in my life. We believe everything they say and or do is happening. The characters all look especially Telly and Casper fifteen years old. Leo Fitzpatrick gives the best performance in the movie. As Telly he sounds rude crude and has a bad attitude. His only interest in life is to ""devirginize"" young women. Everything he says sounds unwholesome and bad we almost want to deny this type of kid exists in America. Justin Pierce gives an excellent performance as Casper. He is basically along for the ride but nevertheless central to the action. He has the final line in the movie. It is ""Jesus Christ, what just happened"". We wonder along with him to as we stare at him knowing he too has HIV now because he just made love to infected Jennie. Chloe Sevigny gives a powerful performance as Jennie. She is helpless, distraught and shocked. She runs around Manhattan looking for Telly and we struggle with her in an undeniably difficult quest.
 ""Kids"" needs to be talked about after its been seen for real man. ""Kids"" doen't tell us exactly what it is all about. There is some form of a message involving safe sex(obviously a film loaded with promiscuous sex is). But safe sex won't change these kids lifestyles or make them better people. When you watch Telly you realize something about him. His only things in life are to have intercourse, drink booze, do drugs and skateboard. The last thing he says is another powerful phrase in the film. He says ""take sex away from me and I really got nothing."" Looking at his life you can't help but accept this as true no matter how hard. You listen to his voice and everything he says and understand why veryone needs their own mixture of philosophy,religion,ideals,curiosities,values,and rules in life that works for them and them only. All teenagers should see this film and if i could i would make standard viewing for everyone between the ages of 13 and 17. This way we understand that without something to open our eyes to the better possibilities of life we might as well sit back and all just be like Telly and swing around with absolutely no curiosities or interests and have sex,drink booze,do drugs and watse away.
Note: This story takes place in Manhattan. We realize that quickly. But this horrifying story of young fifteen or sixteen year old kids could quite possibly happen anywhere in America at any moment in time. In fact its probably going on now in at a least hundred different areas in the United States and most likely the world.",1018051200,4,5008,4.490131578947368

Our protagonists are a pair of mush-mouthed idiots, Telly and Casper, who engage in alcohol abuse, drug abuse, sexual abuse/rape, petty theft and assault as a lifestyle.  We all know that adolescence can seem pretty grim, but we are given no reason at all to sympathize with or identify with these two or any of the film's other characters.  We just watch the boys bully their female friends, parents, local shopkeepers and anybody else who enters the frame.  That said, I really didn't find this to be a 'wake up call' to anything no matter how stridently its proponents howl.  I'm already well aware of what happens to children when they are raised by Viacom/MTV instead of mommy and daddy.  And although this film may be an exaggeration of those consequences, we only see the effect on society.  From Kids, the message continues to be that crime is cool, urban culture is the only culture (as evidenced by the list of trendy concerns in the special thanks section of the credits), and you won't be held accountable for your actions.  The only thing really shocking about this movie was watching Telly try to taste the stomach contents of his victims.  Gross.

But months later, little flashes of the film would be in my head, and I started thinking about giving it a second chance. So I did, and I've watched it nearly twenty times since. I love this movie. Yes, it is disturbing to see the way these kids live, and the fate they've assigned themselves. But for some this is everyday. And we should all see it. Most of the people in this film weren't professional actors, they were kids from the area, people who already live the lifestyle they're portraying. And they present it in an incredibly accurate way, probably for that reason.

I would hope they wouldn't go through half that much in a lifetime. I'm realistic, I know that it's hard out there for teens-peer pressure, violence, rape and drugs and homosexuality abound. But this movie gave no hope or understanding, or strong underlining moral to grab hold of. The attempt at realism was overdone. The movie was a major downer with no punch at the end...so they all had sex and died, the end. Sheesh, I've seen better points made for not having sex with a condom.

She didn't really get the idea of how this is the way quite a few of our young people live their lives.  I think that is why alot of folks hate this film.  Then you have the other side who see it for what it really is - the truth.  Not all teens or kids behave this way but I think parents would be appalled to find out just how many do these things.
Kids start drinking too young, they start having sex too young and they don't think of the consequences.  This film does not in any way glorify teen sex at all.  In fact, it tells a story that no teen movies ever tell and that is that AIDS exists and no one is immune regardless of age or how many sexual partners they have.  Kids is the only film that really tells a story the mainstream moviegoers find too depressing.  Larry Clark has the guts to remind all of us of what's out there.

Seems that all the reviews I've read that claim KIDS was an unrealistic, ridiculous, sensationalist portrayal of youth have been written by people who didn't grow up under those circumstances. It IS something real. Things like those in the movie do happen.  It's not a portrait of ""American Youth."" It's not supposed to be. There ARE kids whose lives are just like those in the film. Kids all over aren't all shooting up or contracting AIDS, but some are. There are so many different things that ""the youth"" are doing, so it's ridiculous to claim that KIDS is or isn't realistic. It IS an accurate picture, of ONE of the things that is. It's not new or outlandish, it's not a fresh look at what some teenagers are doing, and it's not shocking. It doesn't MATTER if it's new or not. ""Teenage nihilism"" isn't NEW. But does that mean an interesting movie can't be made out of it? People look at the supposed ""attempt to be shocking"" of the movie instead of the movie itself. They got so caught up in the opinions of the very young or the ""open-minded"" older crowd who think it  really is fresh and a true cinematic masterpiece, and the SoHo-culture crowd who moan about the boringness and lack of anything even remotely redeeming about it. Watch it for the story, not the hype. Does it have a ""plot""? The more important question is, does that matter? Do you get angry when your life doesn't have a plot?

847797,1,6304346166,"Where to begin?  This movie is an overrated load of nonsense living off nothing but hype.  Conventional, boring, and unrealistic.  Why?  Let's tick off the reasons.
Conventional-- Wow, teenage nihilism.  Like we haven't seen this before.  Is there anyone under the age of 80 who's really shocked to find out that teenagers are having sex and taking drugs?  This stuff has been going on since the Beatniks in the 1950s.  ""Kids"" presents nothing particularly disturbing compared to earlier movies, like ""West Side Story"" [What does it say that a 50's musical has almost as much edge as this movie?], ""Clockwork Orange"", ""Colors"", and ""Menace 2 Society"".  The worst violence here is a brief, gang-style beating of another kid.  Hey, go rent ""Children of the Corn"", made ten years earlier, and watch 13-year-old kids slitting people's throats.
Boring-- The ""plot"" about Jennie trying to find Telly consists of almost nothing but Jennie wandering around saying ""I need to find Telly"" over and over again.  In-between, we're treated to painfully-long, pointless, and mind-numbing ""dialogue"" that literally goes nowhere.  I understand that this is supposed to be the point, but why do we have to watch 90 minutes of it?  I got the message after about five.
Unrealistic-- ""Kids"" does not have a single drop of racial tension.  I was in high school only a couple of years before this movie was made, and admittedly I didn't live in New York, but in San Diego at least, among the young, dumb, and violent, things were generally divided along racial lines.  There was more mixing than in our parents' generation, yes, but still not a whole lot.  ""Kids"" is supposedly a gritty and unflinching view of youth, and at the same time it tries to pretend that teenagers are living in some wonderful color-blind utopia.  I half-expected the cast to start skipping down the street singing ""It's A Small World After All"".
If it's any sort of plus, I agree with the reviewer who said that this movie might be good for high school sex-education classes.  It IS better than the usual educational movie, slightly.  For everyone else, you'll never get back the ninety minutes of life you wasted watching this movie.  Don't say you weren't warned.",1010275200,3,2220,4.900804289544236

If you like movies that don't hold back and show it like it really is then you will love this movie like I do.

And then I saw ""Kids"" and I wonder whether I should look up my Sunday School teacher and thank her, or give my mom twice as many roses next year on Mothers Day for getting so angry with me for staying out too late with my girlfriend when I was 17.  It's hard not to moralize when seeing this film, and middle-class values gasp while watching it.
What I saw was a lack of direction or a complete and total dissonance between reality and hedonistic bliss.  I would compare them to dogs, but even dogs have respect for owners and care about where their next meal comes from. These New York City kids have little, but don't work for anything but what they enjoy, and even that work is illicit.  They shoplift, steal, and share the substances and people that bring them happiness.  There is complete lack of any sort of true authority.  Even though you see many public places, relatively nice NY apartments, and people on their way to work, there are no parents, police, school-teachers or administrators, even older children don't shepherd the younger ones. The scenes in this film show nothing but kids abusing and having sex, essentially gratifying themselves for the short term, since they don't even think about the long term. (...)
The film was particularly shocking. What we saw were kids that have been brought up to think of themselves, of happiness, of bliss, and not the sacrifice necessary that shows them how to get there.  They have no reason to try because bliss is right there for the taking, and there isn't anyone to tell them about the importance of diligence.  They can get and take whatever they need to be happy. Telly even tells his friends this prophetic statement:  ""Aids doesn't exist, and if it does, I'm gonna go out (...), you know what I'm saying!"" Nothing is going to get in their way.  And as the cabby that took Jenni to the rave said, ""if you can't make yourself happy, then why go on?  Don't think about what makes you upset.""  How do you convince these kids about sacrifice?  About how hard work will pay off?  It makes you wonder whether we will be able to bring these kids back to earth, where people struggle to grow food and work to feed families, and eventually take a look at the fruit of their actions.  As Casper says in the final scene (...), in a hung-over stupor, after flashing scenes of Tai Chi in the park and Moslem prayers, ""Jesus Christ, what happened?""

My parents saw it in 1999, and their sheer reluctance to me watching the film told me that it was NOT for kids. I finally saw it and was I ever shocked! This is not a 'brutally honest' look into kids today. Real kids are not as stupid as these were. The girls that Telly deflowered were pathetic and the only sane character in the entire film was the taxi driver. As a virgin myself, I would never want to lose my virginity to someone as UGLY as Telly. And besides, Darcy knew Telly for like, what...two hours before they had sex? Who is really this stupid? I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it's NOT real. Probably one out of every five hundred kids are really like these idiots. All I saw in the movie were carnal boys and spineless girls.

Unfortunately, as much as the viewer would like to deny it, the movie is a very true to life 'hardcore' look at a much too large segment of our disaffected urban teens of today. One does not have to go too far to remember the NY Latin day festival in 2000 when raging bands of teenage youths attacked young women on the street scandalously right in front of the cops.  (...) On a tchnical note, don't expect your wide screen TV to shine since the video resolution that this movie was shot in does not really allow for more than the letterbox version on the DVD.

847910,3,6304346166,"As a teen, my life was very sheltered, but I knew people who lived like this. I went to school with them, I was friends with a few of them.
For me this wasn't really a drama, but more a horror film, with the AIDS virus as Freddie Kruguer. Although it isn't meant to be a ""race against the clock,"" for me, that's how it ended. I was left very disturbed, but only because this movie shows plain as day how simple the AIDS virus is passed around. I was always horrifed when I'd meet girls or guys who had sex with multiple partners, or who lost their virginity to people they hardly even knew. I wondered how they could do such a thing, but the fact of the matter is teenagers think they are invincible, and as disturbing as the film is, I think teens need to see this movie for that very reason. Some of the more for gone kids won't get it and will become fixated on the debauchery, but teens who were like me, or teens who had been followers rather than leaders, or teens who were just uneducated, but sensible with get this movie and may alter their lifestyle.
This movie is also important because most films show sex, but not the consequences of it. Part of the reason why teenagers think its OK to have lots of sex is the image Hollywood and television and music present of sex. The casual attitude towards sex is really a leftover from the ""Sexual Revolution"" and ""free love"" of the '60s, before things like HIV were running around threatening to ruin your entire life. The problem is, Hollywood still promotes the pre-AIDS view about casual sex. And since most young people interpret TV as reality they aren't thinking about getting AIDS.
Now while I think this film is important, it still is flawed. The beatdown of the guy in the park was unrealistic, the scene with the man with no legs was out of place and the whole movie left me screaming ""Where are the parents?"" It lacks depth. You're left with a lot more questions than answers, which may be the purpose. I think another movie like this needs to be made, but it needs to have more depth. This was a cinema verite-style movie, meant for the viewer to interpret that what he or she is viewing is real and really happening, and it does feel that way. I don't necessarily want to see a more ""Hollywood"" glossy version, but I'd like to see something similar with a plot and some parents so we can learn how these miscreants got this way in the first place.
And they really should have explored Ruby's character more. I went to high school with a girl just like her, but I know why she was that way. I think the viewers would have liked to know why most of the characters in kids were the way they were.",1004486400,,2660,4.322
847911,5,6304346166,"Do not listen to Siskel and Ebert.  They give two thumbs up for everything.  This movie is entertaining.  If you are not used to street life, such as drugs, violence, materialism, and other addictive habits, you will surely find this movie fun to watch as well as learn from it.  This will shock some people, mostly parents and teachers.
The movie is about one complete day (24 hours) in the life of two boys and two girls.  Their interactions with each other leads to a silence catastrophy that only the two girls know about.  Telly infected this girl with HIV in the first sexual encounter she had.  Her friend, who has had over 6 sex partners, came out negative to STDs.  But then, at midnight, Telly's best friend, being drunk and possibly under the influence of a controlled substance, rapes the girl with HIV, who is past out on downers.  This movie is different from others in the fact that it is like a documentary.  It has no climax and then a final encounter at the end.  This is not another one of those cliche movies that think they portray the life of teens on the streets.  This film, behind the acting and the directing, does portray life as it really is.  Some people see it more than others.  But just because you don't see it it does not mean it isn't there.  Another movie I recommend is ""Traffic"".  It cannot be compared to ""Kids"" because they are completely different movies.  But both films are directed documentarily.  Parents should not watch this movie because then they will think that all their son's/daughter's friends are like that.  And I think the movie will affect their raising their kids.  But it tells the truth and may help those who spend most of their time in the streets.  On the other hand, it may only give kids more ideas on how to get high and how to steal and not helping at all but making things even worse than they already are.

847913,4,6304346166,"Following the film's grubby and heartless introduction enough to already have an impact upon a viewer and have him think twice as to whether or not he shall continue watching it, there is a scene where Telly, walking along the streets of New York City with his alcohol-dependent friend Casper, narrates to him his latest sexual subjugation, which we have just witnessed in callous detail. Casper is gulping beer from a bottle, which he has likely stolen from a convenience store, for you later see him stealing a fresh one out of the fridge, ever so casually mind you. Telly's language is like strings of hideous blows; he articulates about his exuberance for ""de-virginizing"" young girls, Casper cheers him on, and it becomes clear that neither one of them has any state of curiosity, any esteem, frame of consultation, beyond instantaneous animal regalement.
Then a peculiar thing occurs. Casper respites casually, in plain view of a passerby on a street corner, to urinate. That is not what is odd. What is odd is that Telly opts to stand around the corner from his friend, to grant him privacy. If you scrutinize this body language, you comprehend that these kids live entirely in a world of their own. Other people-adults-simply do not exist, which is a reason large enough to baffle many as to the lactation this film was made in, for the camera, like the characters, sees merely this deplorable youth culture. Director Larry Clark's Kids is a film regarding their world, seeing everything as they see it, being the reason you scarcely get to see Manhattan. It is twenty-four-excessively-agitated-hours in the lives of these youths through one simmering summer day and night during which they travel Manhattan on skateboards and subway trains, shoplift, drink, use drugs, chat about and have sex, party like there's no tomorrow, involve themselves into fights so aggressive they're pestilent, and crash in an accustomed stupor, before beginning all over again the following day. It's clear to us that most of these kids are likely to not make it out alive past a period of their age when others would be worrying about their future careers, if they were to not already be locked behind bars, and it isn't like they have a future to look up for, anyway, nor does anything else interest them in life than doing all of the mutinous things you see them doing in this film. Telly, on the other hand, at least has an interest (or more of a hobby): Sex. His face is a frightening contemplation in self-absorption as he tells girls lies they should laugh at. Being thickheaded, nave, or simply inquisitive, they listen to him, not aware of the consequences that come with such decisions, of Telly's true personality that is always revealed following the acting out upon his sexual fulfillment, which is not at all the compassionate and caring one it's made out to be. Aside from his looks, which weren't much to look at, yet I guess he's quite successful in compelling the curious, his voice was so very rustic and abrasive; everything he says sounds deleterious.
The film sees this culture in such flat, unblinking detail, with dialogue so authentic in the world of today (for it was written by a nineteen-year-old whose life was once familiar to theirs), that you will develop the sensation that you were watching a documentary! With breathtaking images from one of the world's most renowned photographers, Kids is an affecting, no-holds-back landscape of words and language, protracting with raw sincerity and experiences, attitudes and perplexities of innocence lost.

848016,2,6304346166,"""And all the vampires walking through the Valley/Move west down Ventura Boulevard. -- Tom Petty, ""Free Falling""
Move Tom Petty's ""Free Falling"" from Los Angeles to New York and you get the movie ""Kids"", an occasionally shocking but ultimately uninteresting look at a twenty-four hour period in the lives of the new Lost Generation, a glimpse of humans (only in the strict species sense) who have no ambitions or goals drifting aimlessly from one location to the next in search of satisfaction of their most basic animal needs.
Leo Fitzpatrick plays Telly, an adolescent ""Decameron"" and self-described ""virgin surgeon"" whose whole life revolves around the deflowering of young girls. ""Take that away from me,"" he confides in one voice-over, ""and I really got nothing."" He relates his latest conquest (brutally filmed in the movie's opening) to his best friend Casper (Justin Pierce), then, after shoplifting some beer and stopping by a flophouse crammed full of boys and drugs, he reveals his latest plan: he has set his sights on a thirteen-year-old girl named Darcy, and wants to make his conquest that night. ""Two virgins in one day?"" Casper says. ""That's gotta be illegal or something."" (Well, yes, it is, though not in quite the way he thinks.) Meanwhile, Jenny (played by Chloe Sevigny) has just discovered that she has contracted HIV from her single encounter with Telly, and spends the movie trying to find him to give him the news. (A caveat: if Telly is only interested in virgins, then how did he contract HIV? Never mind, I don't want to know.)
It's grim stuff, made even less comfortable by Larry Clark's direction. Clark shoots everything with such gritty realism that the picture takes on a documentary feel. And it's effective; we feel the heat of the day, the sweat on the bodies, the texture of the grimy city, and the result is sensory overload. That the cast is made up of unknowns who try not to remind us that this is only a movie contributes to the effect. It manages to shock even the most jaded moviegoer. At first.
That first twenty minutes is shocking, indeed. We see the deflowering of a young girl, theft, and drug use, we hear frank talk about sex from both boys and girls, we feel the vaccuum that has sucked all vitality and humanity from their lives. Unfortunately, in time the shock wears off, and it becomes obvious that Clark and Korine haven't bothered to present us with interesting characters. We want a reason to care about what happens, but we never do, because screenwriter Harmony Korine has failed to present anybody with an inner life. Aside from some vague pity for Jenny and loathing for Telly, we never feel anything but our own revulsion. Perhaps the point Korine is trying to make is that these kids have nothing to look forward to and nothing to hold onto, but that does not make for good drama. Or any drama at all.
Clark and Korine continue to provide us with shocking images--more drug use, casual violence, crude attempts at symbolism (at one point Telly sucks red Kool-Aid from a tampon), compulsive partying--in a rather desperate attempt to hide their lack of a compelling story. The shock thus becomes exploitative and sensational, much like the set pieces and special effects of a typical Hollywood movie. The effect is less genuine realism than hip nihilism.
Problematic, too, is the absence of any discussion of the issues raised. This is especially frustrating, for this is a movie which should spark debate. We see this movie and ask questions: how did these young people devolve into this cultural catatonia? What were the causes? What can be done about it? Casper, at the end of the movie, dozes naked in a living crowded with other partiers, then wakes and asks, ""What happened?"" It's exactly the question we're asking, but no answer is forthcoming. Again, maybe Korine and Clark feel there are no solutions, but if that's the case my question becomes, ""What's the point?""
While watching ""Kids"" I was reminded of ""Fresh"", another powerful look at contemporary urban life and its effect on the young. Both unflinchingly tackle the theme of inner city despair, but ""Fresh"" also managed to present us with characters who had hopes and dreams; despite an environment of random cruelty and parental apathy, they were still recognizably human, and they made us care. ""Kids"", despite its aggressive stance and catalogue of unpleasant behavior, has nothing more to offer than its own bleak outlook. It is as empty shell; strip it of its shock elements, one finds nothing of import and little of consequence. In the words of Telly, ""Take that away from me and I really got nothing.""",996192000,27,4639,4.851197982345523
848017,3,6304346166,"Kids is a simply produced film shot on hand-held held cameras to give an authentic documentary feel.  Director Clark follows a number of New York city teenagers over a 24-hour period, focusing on Telly, his friend Casper, and Jennie.  Telly's only purpose is to get high, drunk, and ""de-virginize"" as many girls as he can.  As the film progresses, Jennie (one of Telly's victims) eventually learns that Telly has infected her with HIV.  Clark effectively chronicles his characters recklessness and cruelty:  They engage in substance abuse, theft, promiscuous sex, and near murderous violence.  Clark's realistic direction is augmented by superb acting:  Sevigny and Fitzpatrick in particular handle the difficult, often disturbing material with believability and aplomb.  Stylistically, Clark has succeeded in creating a quazi-documentary that is as real as any fictional film can be.
While the acting and style is excellent, on a whole Kids is superficial.  Many lauded Clark for keeping the film a simple chronicle of his characters lives that offers no solutions or explanations.  But Clark not only offers no answers, he offers little or no insight.  Clark does a moderately effective job of holding the viewer's interest, but just doesn't make you feel much after or even during the film.
Kids concludes with Casper regaining consciousness after a night of substance abuse and sexual assault, uttering, ""What happened?"".  Kids is disatisfying because Clark never really tries to answer this question.  He does show their abject environment, but this doesn't really provide any additional emotional depth.  It would be a better film if Clark delved into his character's psyche in an attempt to offer some explanation for their behavior.  Ultimately, Kids is an emotionally disturbing, but strangely unmemorable film that doesn't realize Clark's ambitions.",995760000,5,1859,5.428571428571429
848018,5,6304346166,"Ever since I was 11 and this film first came out on the cinema, i wanted to watch it. All the contreversy surrounding it was appealing, but recently i wanted to watch it because i wanted to see if i could relate to it, being a teengager,but it was only untill a few days ago, i actually got round to renting it. Now most films you are eager to watch for so long actually turn out to be a load of rubbish, and i was afraid that this might turn out the same, but HOW I WAS WRONG!
This is a REAL teen movie, a film which shows exactly what us teens get up to, although i must say as a depiction of most teenagers, it's a slightly exagerated portrail of an average teenagers every day life, but still shockingly true anyway. Just cos this is a teen movie, by no means is it a sugar coated flick like never been kissed or loser, if I was to compare it with anything, i'd have to describe it as, the breakfast club on speed and outdoors.
Now many adults spoke out about this film and spoke out about how ""exploitive"" and ""outragous"" this movie was. But the truth is they can't deal with the fact that this goes on and is happening today, it goes on the street, why not show it on screen? you show people getting mutilated,raped,you show family's being killed by their kids,you show men waking up with dead horses next to them, and that's acceptable but showing what teenage life is REALLY about is not? Come on!
If you do get shocked and upset from harsh scenes in movies however, I would advise not to watch it, It may seem harsh in some scenes in the movie,the beating in the park,the rape scene,the drug abuse,the sex scenes which are all shown in graphic detail, but if you watch it throughout right to the end, I don't care, you'll LOVE it.
All teenagers above the age of 14 should watch this, especially girls, because this is what ""MOST"" guys talk about, with little respect for females(i should know, i'm a guy...at least i was last time i checked!)Even if at times a little far fetched or only regarding a small amount of teens, this film has elements that every teenager can relate to.

848019,2,6304346166,"In a way the purpose of this film is to shock. And it did. The cavalier and casual attitude toward sex and drugs is shocking enough on its own. However, the fact that the kids (yes, kids) indulging in these more decadent and dangerous things is positively sickening. I heard a lot about this movie for years, but I did not see it until recently. I feel sure that I would have been horrified by this film whether I had been a teenager or a mid-twenties (and sheltered) woman that I am today. The real tragedy is when a girl (Chloe Sevigny) discovers that she is HIV positive as a result of one sexual encounter with a guy, Telly, who has a reputation for going around and having sex with all the girls he can convince. And convince them he does, with smooth talking, lies and a lot of persuasion over the girls' clear reluctance. Sevigny's character is the most likeable as the innocent whose life comes apart at its fragile seams when she accompanies a much more promiscuous friend to a clinic to be tested. Sevigny is tested only as a favour to the friend. Her friend is HIV negative. Sevigny then wanders through the city to confront Telly, who is, as the film progresses, deflowering yet another young girl. When Sevigny finally locates him at a party in the midst of having sex with his latest conquest, she passes out and another friend rapes her while she is unconscious, having no idea what he is getting himself into. Overall this film is just... shocking and horrifying. I don't even have the adjectives to describe how affecting this film is. I wish it were not so disturbing and so nonchalant.

There is almost no humanization to the characters except Miss. Sevigny.  The film is completely aimless and borderlines on pornography.  I don't think that shocking and disturbing us is the way to get us to change things in the lives of youth.  Fear is the only thing we create, because most of us are just as ignorant as the youths depicted in this film.  I will say that the film hit close to home to my high school days, even if it was a bit more severe.  Thats precisely why I gave mercy with two stars.

Yes, some teens have sex. Yes, some teens do drugs. I have done some of those things myself. But there isn't much realism to this story. I think Clark and Korine just made this as shocking as possible because they wanted to come off as hip, and they wanted attention. The cinematography is bad. The sound is bad. The editing isn't all that great either. The acting is so-so. I don't think parents should see this with their children. Sure, it deals with important issues, especially safe sex.

You also have to mind that these kids were just actors.  After having taught in the New York Public Schools in New York for two years and growing up as a white teen in the Mission Hill section of Roxbury, Massachusetts, I can say that the kids in this movie make up less than .2% of the kids in the inner cities.  Lots of kids have drank when they were 8 or 9 but not many of them act as stupid as these kids.  People just aren't that bad in real life, and most of the kids in NYC are great.  Many kids in the suburbs or parts of the city that have money have an attraction to these kinds of movies becuase of some insecurities of their own, and want to be a part of this urban culture because of something that they are missing in their own lives.

I first saw this film in the  theater.  I knew it would be a hard film to watch; that's an  understatement.  You'll find some interesting parts of the film that may  bring back some adolescent feelings of insecurity and curiousity about sex.  I think we all harbored these feelings to some extent when when we were  teenagers.  What really hit me hard is the main focus of the movie: STDs.  I won't spoil the plot for you because if I tell you any more I may risk  destroying the experience this movie gives first time viewers. I hope no  one else has spoiled the plot line for you.
Although it sounds  unorthodox, I think they should show this film in ALL highschool (11th or  12th grade) sex/health classes.  If I had seen it when I was 17 I would  have had a better understanding of the consequences unprotected sex can  bring.

All that happens is a Kid with AIDS has sex, smokes some  marijuana, has more sex, participates in violence, and then has more sex.  THAT IS THE MOVIE.  So, why did it have to be made, to inform parents about  bad kids?  Hardly.  The director of this movie obviously has no experience  in filmmaking (maybe he used a shaky camera at a party or something).  Funny thing is, that's all this piece of garbage is, a shaky camera  following stupid kids around.  I hope you find this review helpful, but I'm  guessing most people won't just because they like the movie, and they don't  welcome my opinion.

It's like a gifted filmmaker took a camera out on the streets and just let it roll, capturing  every facet of teenagers gone wild and off the deep end of delinquency.  Nothing is masked by censorship, but is here in its entirety with every  brutal and horrific image ever imagined played out here mercilessly. The  story focuses on Telly, who has this overwhelmingingly insatiable hunger  for making girls lose their virginity. But he may have gone too far. One  girl, Jennie, who had a wild time with him, has been infected with the AIDS  virus and must scour the city of New York to find Telly and warn him of the  pending danger that will one day claim him as well. But her search is in  vain, mixed with the horror of the inevitable that she will die at an early  age thanks to him. Telly is off with his buddies living it up, and the  night Jennie finds him, she makes the horrific discovery that she may be  too late. This film is definitely not for the faint hearted or the saints.  On a level or morale it looks nasty and hideous to the art of filmmaking,  but when looked at from the perspective of movies as an art form, it is a  genuine masterpiece of seizing real images in life on film and playing it  out before the eyes of those who refuse to admit that the youth of our  country is going in the wrong direction in life. This film is daring in  every way possible, from the language teenagers use to their vile ideas of  how to have fun in life.

Is there a light side?  I don't know, should it show a light side, should it have even a single character we can feel sympathy for?  NO.  The film is very pure and plays very strictly by it's own rules, pulling no punches. whether it's stupidity, drug use brutality or the rape of a minor there is no turning away, and no polite little nods to help you accept that this only a movie.

In the mid-eighties I was an HIV counselor to homeless  youth, whose participation in a study necessitated their revealing their  personal i.e. sexual lives.  I knew I could be trusted; they didn't, but  eventually many of the kids did tell me what was truly up.  I paid a lot of  attention to how the straight media responded to this film, and most of it  was infuriating.  I suspect it's a form of denial to say that most kids  don't live lives like those in the film; maybe most don't, but some do.  And those kids are not throwaways, just like I wasn't.  One small  quibble: screenwriter Harmony Korine has claimed in interviews that the  dialogue was written to the word and that there was no improvisation.

It is episodic like real life and the kids playing the kids are  frighteningly real.

If you want to stick educational interests and add morale nuances to it, fine.  Indeed the title suggests that this is what happens with kids, in an open,  general statement. It is a powerful tool to tell kids to watch out and be  careful with drugs and unsafe sex.
But you could also see it as an  out-of-the-average success. After all, if we are to take this movie's facts  as real and average, most teens in America and the rest of the developed  world would be infected with AIDS, addicts to a multitude of drugs and  making their families disintegrate. This is more likely to represent a  dramatic moment in the life of some teens that might not represent the  whole teen world. It can be documentary if we look into some specific  groups of teens growing up in frantic, highly developed cities like New  York. That's it. The whole debate of ""kids"" showing what average  kids do today is a little absurd.
Instead I'll focus on the technique  and the mastery of filming, character developing and storytelling. The film  is powerful and delivers a high level of impact because of this as well as  for the raw, rude images. The mixed elements became a singular whole, in  the same way blacks, hispanics and whites team up against others or to have  fun. The melting pot culture can be felt in the story almost as good as in  the way the movie is done.
At the bottom line, this is a movie that can  be experienced by such a wide range of different people. Teens can relate  to some or even all events depicted. Relaxed parents can star thinking they  do not care enough for their babies. Artists and creators can witness a  movie developed with flawless, accurate skills and with a  hardly-seen-lately-in-movies punch and thrill. It deserves to be a popular  film in all senses.
