8290316,4,B001CX5ME8,"If you're a complete beginner like I was, this is the dvd for you. I knew nothing of yoga before this dvd.  Yolanda is a great instructor, giving guidance through all aspects of the postures and breathing.  The dvd itself is also nice, providing the english and sanskrit names of all postures before you engage in them as well as the benefits they intend.  In addition, the scene selection page shows each of the postures beign performed by Yolanda in case you don't remember the names.  If you're at all competent in yoga, you'll most likely find this dvd below your level, but for those of us who can't touch our toes, this is a great first step to exploring yoga.",1277769600,2,666,4.479338842975206
8290317,3,B001CX5ME8,"My wife states the DVD received did not match the DVD that was ordered. The DVD received has a different title/jacket = Simply Yoga - Mind Body Spirit. This is not the DVD pictured/titled as shown. In spite of this issue, the DVD is given 3 stars for its video quality and content.",1253664000,,281,4.320754716981132
