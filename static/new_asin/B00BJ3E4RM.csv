8569324,4,B00BJ3E4RM,"It's good. I have all of Tanja's workout videos and they pretty much have the same routines with a couple of variations. She's a great instructor. Always feel my workouts are challenging with her. This particular video is the same as the boot camp video I have, with the exception of the partner workout. Overall a good video, just wish I would of known it was the same as her previous videos I already own.",1434067200,,407,4.44
