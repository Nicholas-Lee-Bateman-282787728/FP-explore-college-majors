752583,1,6304004567,I can't believe that my wife and I spent three hours watching this tripe.  The acting is ho hum and the plot is unimaginably stupid.  It doesn't hang together in the least. The rationale for people's actions are never explained and the ending is totally unbelievable.  David Janssen was far too old to be the 'babe magnet' dnd seducer his character was meant to portray.  Stay away from this one.,1156464000,8,396,4.614285714285714
752584,5,6304004567,"In the dank catacombs beneath Ostia, Italy, an archeologist discovers an ancient manuscript that could turn the Christian world into chaos.

Said to contain the writings of Christ's younger brother, James the Just, the faded document ignites the religious world with controversy.

Confusion turns to conflict when a wealthy publisher seeks to publish the unauthenticated document.  His only obstacle: a powerful theologian dedicated to the suppression of this new Bible.  Caught in the middle of this embittered battle is a public relations expert hired to promote the new Bible.

But there are greater forces at work, and he soon finds himself sinking into a quagmire of greed, deceit, and violence.  Someone is hiding the truth about THE WORD.",1144108800,4,745,5.271186440677966

752586,3,6304004567,"There is another version of this video. It is called ""The Word"" by USA Home Video, and it has two tapes in a pack with 188 minutes in a full length feature film (according to the box).",1047427200,15,184,4.0

7858432,3,6304004567,"15 years ago I may have given this a four.
I read a book along time ago about The Q document  from which Matthew Mark Luke may have drawn there gospel writings and they're sayings.
The Q document book and this movie seem very similar

Don't recall the author of the Q document book
Since then many critics of trying to cast doubt upon the scripture writing itself or to uplift false gospels that were found and nag Hammandi in 1945.
The majority of the at the so called Gnostic gospels
are not even close to the Gospels of Matthew Mark Luke and John and do not tell the life of Christ but of magical ""Events"" in the life of Jesus from the viewpoint of Greek philosophy.

Still as fiction goes this movie, The Word, was a very interesting miniseries when it first came out we also see the world of publishing whether it's biblical literature or nonfiction literature that we still have to deal with today.
Too many times the hype is more important that the book itself in the publishing industry,
but this will never happen with the Bible so I guess I give it 3 1/2 stars",1411084800,,1070,4.34
7858433,2,6304004567,The audio in part one of this series (VHS Movie) is not good sounds as if the tape is dragging so the dialouge is slurred the video is OK but the audio takes away from the over all quality of the movie,1403568000,,201,3.8095238095238093
7858434,4,6304004567,However unlikely the premise and while not a mystery this is a thought-provoking and entertaining movie.....a good way to spend a few hours.,1402617600,,140,5.130434782608695
7858435,5,6304004567,"Read the book many years ago..before I saw the movie. Confused the two and got a different ending than I expected but I searched for this miniseries for a long time and was happy to find it here.
The book was more exciting.",1362614400,,223,4.209302325581396
7858436,1,6304004567,This VHS was a bad buy. The quality is so bad that I can not even watch it. I am sure the movie would have been interesting however the tracking was so bad that I had to stop watching in fear that the tape would ruin my VCR.,1356739200,,224,3.6875
7858437,5,6304004567,"Saw this on television many, many years ago and had been trying to find it. Wish it had been available on DVD but we were still glad to find it on VHS. David Jansen was one of my favorite actors. Recommend The Word to anyone who has not seen it.",1356739200,,245,3.92
7858438,4,6304004567,"This may be a cut version, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I still find it quite
interesting to watch. I have never seen the original 6 hour mini series, so I can't really say that I miss anything. The ""188 minute"" version seems to stand quite niceley on its own.
This video is availble, spanning 1, 2 or 3 tapes. In every case 188 minutes long. As far as I know, the complete 6 hour version was never released on video for puplic sale.
Hopefully this movie will be relaesed on DVD one day. With a bit of luck we might even get to see the full 6 hour version.",1349481600,,566,4.108108108108108
7858439,5,6304004567,"The Word you saw on television when it was first released is not this video. The cuts are so deep that in thier effort to make it fit in one video cassette, they even cut off the ending altogether, In the original ending, David Jansen's father (John Houston) recovers from his stroke and tells his son how the new Third Testament has changed his life and the lives of millions of others. It's the punchline of the film and they cut it off! Don't waste you money.",1285372800,5,462,4.32183908045977
7858440,1,6304004567,"The original mini-series was 6 hours long...this version is only 3 hours.

IGNORE all the nonsense about this being the un-edited, full-length, un-cut version....PURE LIES!

If you are going to cut 50% of a movie for purely economical, greedy, self-serving purposes, as the distributors of this VHS tape have done...expect a movie that makes no sense whatsoever.

Again: the distributors of this have trashed and destroyed a great mini-series for purely greedy intentions and seem to forgot that some of us remember the original.

IGNORE THIS VERSION AT ALL COSTS !!!",1168732800,19,567,5.197802197802198
