6613206,4,B00N83X2SS,"There are far too few horror films about America's favorite pasttime: Baseball. I can only think of a handfull of true horror films that deal with the subject, like BLOOD GAMES (1989) and the truly awful THE CATCHER (1998). There have been plenty of thrillers and crime films that use baseball as a major plot point, but not many true horror films. That is, until now. This horror film is a true gorehound's delight and has a pretty good story to go along with it, with an ending that will take you by surprise. We see some unknown psycho watching a tape of a Little League game, while he puts a wooden baseball bat in a vice. He hammers huge nails through it and inserts a large retractable blade at the tip. He then goes to the library to look at some microfiche about a missing man in 1995, who was last seen stumbling out of a tavern drunk as a skunk. We see the drunk guy pissing in an alley, where the psycho, now dressed in an Umpire's uniform complete with mask and deadly altered bat, chases the guy and pulls him from trying to escape under a garage door. He splatters the man's brains with the nail-filled bat, burns a number into his flesh and then uses the blowtorch to burn off his face on a team Little League photo. We then see the psycho use some chain pulley system in an underground room (it will be explained later), while he goes outside and hits a baseball into a lake, while we watch the ball sink to the bottom. We are now in Two Rivers, Wisconsin (filmed on location) in 1996, as tomboy bartender Alison McKenzie (Erin Hammond) notices a young man walk into the bar and order a whiskey on the rocks. It turns out he is Alison's old Little League teammate Bobby Spooner (Marshall Caswell) and they haven't seen each other since they were kids when that unfortunate ""accident"" happened. Bobby and Alison's old teammates (and lifelong Two Rivers residents) Kyle (Nick Sommer) and Danny (Max Williamson) soon join them at the bar. Both Kyle and Danny are dressed in baseball uniforms because they just got done playing a game in the local Adult League. They reminisce about the old days while purposely avoiding the subject of the ""accident"". The three guys go to the local ballfield to play a game of hit and catch, making fools of themselves, generally having fun and are soon joined by Alison when she gets off duty. It's apparent that there is some sexual heat between Bobby and Alison, but something hangs above all their heads like a black cloud. None of the four want to talk about it, but it eventually comes out. This is the 15 year anniversary when something really bad happened and Allison mentions that they should have a memorial this weekend for their childhood friends Sam and Jamie, as well as their Coach Fredricks at the Coach's cabin in the woods. But what actually happened to the three? Kyle has a flashback to when he was a kid and he saw his three friends murdered by fellow teammate Billy Haskins (Sebastian Weigman) at the ballfield in 1981, while the police handcuff Billy and take him away (Billy shoved a baseball bat down Coach Fredricks' throat and the other two victims were left in bloody posed positions). The young Kyle screams out, F*** you, Billy! F*** you!"" as the flashback ends. The Umpire goes back to the library and pulls out some more microfiche, where he reads newspaper stories about Billy Haskins and how he was committed to a mental institution for his brutal murders. We see a bald Billy in his hospital room, grotesque pictures drawn on the wall and he is always crying. The Umpire calls a pizza delivery guy and has him deliver it to the wrong address. Apparently, the pizza delivery guy was also a teammate on that 1981 team, as the Umpire stands in the middle of the road and the pizza guy gets a flat tire trying to avoid him. While he is changing the tire, the Umpire sneaks up behind him and stabs him in the back, the blade protruding out of his stomach, by the homemade deadly baseball bat's retractable blade. He burns a number on the pizza guy's skin (What could that possibly mean? The numbers aren't in any discernible order.) and then uses the blowtorch to burn his face out of the team photo (by the looks of it, the Umpire has already claimed 6 victims). The problem is, none of the victim's bodies are ever found. Our four friends head out to the Coach's cabin, when they stop to play some miniature golf and hit some balls at a batting cage. Danny sees an old guy slapping a young boy behind a building and it triggers a flashback in Danny's mind, where Coach Fredricks (Michael Stansy) is yelling at a young Billy for not getting hit with a pitch and taking ""one for the team"". Seems like the Coach wasn't such a nice guy after all, especially to Billy. After the flashback, they get into their vehicle and head for the cabin, but someone is following them. Once at the cabin, all four of them see the same team photo that the Umpire is using to burn faces off and Alison has to remind Bobby that he gave her her first kiss there (Bobby doesn't seem to remember). It just happens to be Halloween. so the Umpire walking around in his get-up does not raise any flags. The Umpire's next victim is a housewife (and former 1981 Little League team member) handing out candy, when the Umpire bashes her head in with the bat, burns the number ""04"" on her chest and blow-torches her face off the team photo. The four friends drive to the Coach's gravesite to pay tribute to him, when they are stopped by a police officer and he ends up hauling Bobby's ass in jail for alleged drunk driving (The officer seems to know Bobby, but Bobby has no idea who he is). Danny walks back to the cabin, while Alison and Kyle find the Coach's grave (they first find a grave with the name ""Anita Mint"" engraved on it!), but someone has removed his corpse from the grave. Kyle blames Billy, but Alison says he should blame her (There is more to Billy's story that we haven't been told yet.). The guy that was following them enters the cabin carrying a shotgun, so Danny hides under one of the beds. The mysterious man makes a phone call to tell the person that hired him that they are not there right now, but ""someone's gonna die"", then hangs up the phone and leaves. Danny lights his way under the bed with a Bic, where he sees strange drawings in the underside of the bed, the same type of drawings we saw in Billy's institution room. This could be interpreted as a prime example of child abuse. Bobby is booked and is purposely put in a cell with a crazy person who tries to kill him. What does this officer have against him? Danny finds a bunch of chocolates in Alison's purse when no one returns by daytime and eats them all. When Alison and Kyle return to the cabin a short time later and Alison notices that all the chocolates have been eaten, she freaks out. She tells Kyle that they were ""boomers"", or chocolate-covered psychedelic mushrooms. A very high Danny cuts the chain to the shed and steals a four-wheeled ATV and goes for a psychedelic joyride. Kyle finds a gun in the truck's glove compartment. Danny has a freak-out scene, which trips another flashback, where he sees Kyle, Bobby and Alison shoving Billy behind the bleachers because he's not a good ballplayer, telling him once again he ""screwed up"". Is it possible that Billy was being bullied by the four people we have come to know and care about? Danny continues to trip-out and finds an old school bus in the woods, where he has hallucinations of people looking at him and saying he did nothing to stop them. Danny then actually runs into the Umpire and he tries to get away on the ATV, but he is so stoned, he clotheslines himself on a low-hanging tree branch and is knocked off the ATV. Danny hops on the ATV to try to escape again, but it's ""Batter up!"" as the Umpire beheads Danny with one swing of his bat's blade. The Umpire burns the number ""14"" on Danny's chest (it's at this time we learn that the numbers burned on the chests correspond with the numbers on their Little League uniforms) and burns his face off the team photo. Want to know what happens to the other three, who the mysterious stranger is and if Billy is actually the Umpire? Well, you'll have to buy the DVD or watch it streaming. Either way, its a unique little horror film about America's pasttime and the denouement comes as a complete surprise for a film that looks like it is going to be the usual DTV slasher film. It's very gory, Alison finally shows her boobs and the story has a satisfying conclusion that nearly everyone won't see coming. There are also other surprises revealed, especially about Kyle and who the mysterious stranger really is. As a matter of fact, there are no loose strings I can think of, one of the first times that has happened to me in a film in a long, long time.  Directors/producers/screenwriters Drew Rosas (BLOOD JUNKIE - 2010; who was also the sound editor and has the role of the police officer who arrests Bobby) and Nick Sommer (his first directorial effort; he plays Kyle in the film with a lot of style) keeps the mystery coming and the blood flowing at a rapid pace and the gore goes way past what the MPAA would consider R-Rated. All I will tell you is that nearly everyone is not who they say they are and we learn what the chain pulley system is used for when Alison finds the underground room and accidentally trips it (it's not pretty). I believe that this is the best baseball-themed horror film I have ever seen and, even though it was made with a low budget, the story is high concept. This should please most horror film fans, especially those who were bullied when they were young. The killer's sacrifice at the film's end is especially poignant and there are no end credits stingers like most new DTV films. This is what most horror films should hope to achieve: Give you a good mystery to go along with the gory effects (and all of them here were physical). This is not your typical DTV horror film.

6613208,5,B00N83X2SS,"I actually cannot give this a proper review as I am bias; the character who is indeed ""on drugs"" is portrayed by my brother Max Williamson. He had great fun making the film but mostly does theatre. I feel he is a scene stealer, as he always has been in life. It's odd for me to watch, because for me it's like just watching my brother goof off and be himself. For other horror buffs like myself though, I do feel Billy Club will most likely be enjoyed by those who love the genre.",1443657600,,480,4.117021276595745

6613237,4,B00N83X2SS,"Overall Billy Club is a worthy slasher film that is an instant cult classic. I enjoyed this film immensely, I connected with the vibe of little league having played up until JV, the nods and homage to classic 80s slashers are tasteful and not rip-offs, and the killer is just a nightmare. Truly creative and menacing. The cinematography is done nicely, enough of the film happens in darkness (which is how a horror film should be), the scenery and sets are odd, eerie elements that just amp up the chilling subject matter. But mostly the guts and gore are the big draw for horror fans to the film. Definitely check this one out!",1431475200,,628,4.566371681415929

""man this guy has friends"". That is the only thing that explains the positive reviews of the film that has been made a million times.  but a million times better. The acting is horrible you actually want hem to die. I  only got about 45 minetets into the film and i just had to turn it off because it was boring and the most annoying character and actor was not dead yet. This is insufferable its a bore with bad killings no gore a d a mercy reason as to why this was happening. As to the interesting camera angles; film school; 101, thats all. They didn't help the film just made it look like a commercial , oh and i noticed a few product placements that were funny when they stop for beer the ""wacky"" guy runs over to a mini golf corse as everyone leave he runs down the list of everything you can do there with the sign promptly in the back ground. Sad. Now if that wasn't a way the makers got a couple thousand to make this silly film bad on me and io am sorry but no i am not because its poor writhing if your dialogue sounds like a commercial. As a huge gore and horror fan this film pissed me off, i canrt wait for the day when we can start making people repay the money i paid on this crap.",1429401600,2,1375,3.9963636363636366
6613244,3,B00N83X2SS,"A slow start to a movie with more potential to have been a very good teen slasher. Some comical moments that were not as funny as they could have been.

6613260,3,B00N83X2SS,"Not horrible and not good. And nowhere near great or bad enough to be trashy campy treasure. Some nice use of 1990's nostalgic microfilm and a CD jukebox. Back before the internet murdered everything and made most things available in your home and at your fingertips instantly. A funny pizza delivery scene killing with the wrong suspect being arrested by cops and fleeing away in his Bryan Cranston tighty whiteys. Kudos to the ATV go-pro hallucination scene that came out of left field and was a home run. Most of the kills were professional and impressive.

To harsh to call the filmmakers ""wannabes"" or fugazi because their heart was in the right place. But if I watch one more formulaic clichd flashback than I will bash myself in the head with a baseball bat full of rusty nails.

Nothing real original a Graduation Day (1981) / Some Guy Who Kills People (2011) ripoff played out with a baseball theme. And a crazy baseball horror movie called Catcher (1998) seemed to inspire a few scenes as well. Just passing my opinion to fellow movie lovers to skip this one like a rock and get your jolly ranchers elsewhere. Time available to watch our beloved films is so precious.

Nobody likes to trash somebody's art. These guys obviously love movies. Fanboys love them so much we all dream of making one or two. But at the end of the day some of us were just born to watch them.

So, I watched BILLY CLUB, fully expecting to hate every dumb minute of it. Instead, to my great shock, I loved this movie! In 1981, in the small town of Two Rivers, Wisconsin, two little league baseball players and their coach are slaughtered by a team-mate named Billy Haskins. Billy is arrested and winds up in a mental institution. Fifteen years later, someone, dressed in the aforementioned get-up, is murdering  people. Has Billy returned for more blood-letting? Meanwhile, four former players from Billy's team head out to the coaches remote, old cabin in the woods for a celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of the massacre. Not unexpectedly, they soon cross paths w/ the world's angriest catcher! Mass-carnage abounds. Filled w/ sympathetic characters, humor, and retro-style slasher atmosphere, BILLY CLUB is a well-constructed, low-budget film that delivers the gooshy goods!

6613283,5,B00N83X2SS,Wow this movie was awesome! I loved the director's first film Blood Junkie which should be also checked out. It was a great homage to 80's slashers also and is one underrated film. Billy Club is a great sophomore effort which I already consider probably the best slasher I seen in awhile! It homages so many films of the old but still stays on its own. I really enjoyed the characters and the setting. A lot of the actors are new faces except for two. Co-director nick summer who was the star of blood junkie and veteran actor Mark Metcalf who played Neidermeyer in Animal house and was also in the 80s horror film The Final Terror. I highly recommend this film and can't wait for what Drew Rosas brings next!,1418169600,11,709,4.419847328244275
6613284,4,B00N83X2SS,"Billy Club is very successful at bringing us the viewer a straight up formulaic slasher film with a retro flair. It has all the basics needed for a great slasher film,the first being good kills with good gore effects.

Another being the opening flashback that's cause for revenge. Only in Billy Club they slowly unravel the somewhat mysterious ordeal through out the film. The killer dons a catchers mask and carries a mean bat complete with bayonet with nails as spikes.

The film also boasts Clever camera angles and a good cast. There was a small amount of humor but this was a straight up no holds barred slasher that was good enough to play it straight! Of course there's somewhat of a twist but nothing that's a major revelation. Bottom line it's a great stalk and slash something we haven't had enough of this year.",1415664000,8,822,4.623287671232877

8676558,4,B00N83X2SS,"I grew up in the 70s and 80s so I have a particular fondness for films of those eras. As such upon seeing the trailer for Billy Club I thought that this looked like a typical 80's slasher with a killer with a MO I hadn't seen yet, and after watching a movie where a killer used a giant fishing lure I thought I'd seen it all. So I went into this expecting a somewhat generic, possibly cheesy little throwaway horror and instead discovered a diamond in the rough. This film will never be an 80s classic like say My Bloody Valentine, a film which it shares a number of common traits, but its heart is in the right place and it's really worth a watch.

While the acting isn't great, but its far from awful and in fact the characters have some depth to them and unexpected nuance here and there which is rather subtly hinted at. The characters are often likable and even the ones who aren't (like the total douche of a sheriff) still have character and serve the story. There are plot holes which are roughly filled in by the end as some of the story is a bit nonlinear and can lead to some confusion. The killer has a nicely themed look and weapon, and a motive for revenge that makes sense. The baseball them really works for this guy in a good way right up until the very last shot of the film and is actually rather satisfying that way as some themed slashers either have gimmicks that come across as hokey in the vein of the old Adam West Batman tv show or the gimmick is presented and never really adhered too.

If you appreciate 80s slasher/revenge flicks and aren't looking for a masterpiece I think you'll find this film to be surprisingly enjoyable. Its got some good shots, develops mood here and there, has a few character arcs and is generally enjoyable.",1522627200,,1763,4.33939393939394

8676562,4,B00N83X2SS,"Billy Club is a decent killer movie, but there's a couple things that bother me.  One is that it gets really messy during the final 20 minutes.  You can tell the film's low budget then.  Up to that point I thought the characters were pretty good.  I cared about them at least.  Another problem is the fact the killer... is a guy with a baseball bat, and the topic of baseball being the main concept for the movie.  Yeah that's not a good creation for a horror film, haha!  But the killer does have his moments, though not as often as I'd have liked.  I like in the beginning when that drunk guy disrespectfully throws a bottle at his face, misses, so the killer has to take his spiked bat (his weapon of choice!) and bash him over the head with it.  The drunk guy kinda had it coming given his attitude though!

The story is that these grown men and women who return to the place they used to play Little League baseball.  A tragedy happened here 15 years earlier, and a few kids were killed in a triple homicide.  At first these returning men and women don't seem to care about the deaths all that much.  They party and act like they're celebrating more than anything.  The guys (being typical guys!) comment that their female friend really grew up and no longer resembles a Tom Boy.  But eventually during a quality campfire scene they reflect on the past events that happened and show a compassionate side that I like.  The one guy of the group even says that even though he didn't know those who died very well, they still feel like family to him.  This is when I realized these characters aren't just a bunch of silly party animals and they're worth caring about after all.

I like the pizza scene.  A young man delivers a pizza to a guy's house but he comes to the door insisting he didn't order a pizza so he yells at the delivery driver.  The pizza delivery driver actually gets upset when the man rejects the pizza and throws it at his door.  He even eats a piece of pizza and spits it on the ground.  Calm down dude!  Someone out there will pay for that pizza (me probably!)  Soon after the driver is killed and the man of the house is blamed for it.

When the friends are out drinking and driving late at night the town cop pulls them over.  This cop is definitely weird.  He points his fingers at the driver's forehead (Billy) in the shape of a gun and demands he take a breathalyzer test.  The results are 0.11 so he has to spend the night in jail.  The cop also grabs some beer in the back of the truck for himself, lol.  The jail itself looks more like a mental hospital room with a crazy dude strangling Billy, forcing the cops to come in and beat the man down.  This scene is strange in that it appears when Billy enters the room, the crazy man looks like he's in a nearby jail cell but... he's actually in the same cell as Billy.

The killer spends his time hiding until he finds the right opportunity to strike.  The goofy guy of the group encounters a situation where he peeks around the corner of a store and sees a man smacking his wife around.  He remembers his past when his Little League coach used to drill him in the dugout for not swinging at pitches properly, and that he needs to stand up for himself.  This is what I mean about the concept of baseball used in a horror movie being weird, lol.

This same goofy guy breaks into a cop's house for some reason and hides under the bed when he comes home.  Come morning he sees chocolate tainted with drugs on the kitchen counter.  When taking them he gets delirious and rides his fourwheeler into the woods acting incredibly whacked out.  Just then the killer appears with his spiked bat.  The guy tries to defend himself but his brain is now officially in drug mode so he can't swing his weapon properly.  He jumps on his fourwheeler and hits a dead end with a branch in the way, so he turns around and... the killer is waiting for him with his spiked bat in swing mode... and off goes his head!

The female of the group cheats on her boyfriend with Billy in a bathroom.  When the boyfriend opens the door and finds Billy hiding in a closet he gets angry.  He seems for forgive rather quickly however, and they both go for a ride in a truck.  The guy actually makes a pass towards Billy and gets upset when Billy doesn't like it.  He insists ""You looked at me!"" implying Billy wanted it, but apparently he didn't.  Soon after this the sexually confused guy contends with the killer and gets whacked in the face for his troubles.  After this the female of the group accidentally shoots the cop when she thinks the killer is coming through the front door instead.

The story gets chaotic after this.  The killer continues beating people up with his bat and dumps them in a lake.  Some of the characters find the bodies and freak out.  The cops arrive to the scene to try and rescue the woman standing by the lake scared, but it's all for nothing as the killer is much faster and stronger than those old cops.  The ending though... wow it's pretty bad.  SPOILERS!  Billy's the killer.  He takes it personally that his fellow Little Leaguers used to tease him by making him participate in that dunk tank game where he has to sit on an upper ledge and someone throws a ball at a nearby target making him drop in the water.  To be honest he wasn't picked on *that* bad.  I've seen worse.  The female of the group feels bad that she's the one who hit the target making him drop in the water.  She feels responsible.

Anyway about that bad ending.  SPOILERS!  Billy's either trapped in a baseball cage or simply doesn't want to get out.  He either stands against the wall or someone ties him to the wall as baseballs quickly shoot from a machine and head right for his eye making it swollen and shut.  A second baseball hits him... and the movie's over.  Really weird, but the credits are awesome thanks to TWO really good themes.  The first theme sounds like a throwback to the 70's hard rock days.  Awesome guitar work and riff.  The second song is probably called ""Drinking Is a Friend of Mine"" given how catchy the chorus is.  It sounds like a part grunge/part hard rock tune and it's really good.

I enjoy this movie.  The killer could've made a few more appearances and he definitely could have been more violent at times instead of always relying on that trusty spiked bat of his, but he's okay.  Billy being the killer is a surprise.  Well I mean, if you ignore the name of the movie it's a surprise, lol.  The acting's the weak point perhaps.  It's not that good even if the story holds together until the final 20 or so minutes.",1500508800,,6607,4.3278955954323
8676563,2,B00N83X2SS,"Two and a half stars to this horror movie with perhaps a slightly higher budget than many.

One gets the feeling and has the impression here that there was some serious editing done, as the kill scenes often seem to be intended as gorier and more graphic, only to be held back. Such a more extreme film may have worked better, whereas the one we have is okay but not much more.

With the gore apparently suspended, what we have is more of a thriller. A guy in an umpire outfit is killing people because of things that happened in his childhood, and that's about it. There is a ""surprise"" ending, but I suspect many will see it coming. The cast gives it their all with their performances here - which unfortunately means that they too often overact. The direction is not assured enough to keep character emotions and attitudes flowing evenly from scene to scene. And the film seems uncertain in a number of ways. For one thing, the killer's umpire outfit is interesting, but not very scary in my view.

Many of these problems, once again, could be the fault of editing, and I wouldn't mind seeing a different version of this if one is available.

As for the good in the film - it takes a shot at the dark side of ""our national sport,"" from the point of view of the kids and grown kids who knew it from Little League.  This theme is compelling throughout and kept me watching. Recommended for an at-bat, with the option of drawing a walk.",1487980800,,1436,4.40377358490566
