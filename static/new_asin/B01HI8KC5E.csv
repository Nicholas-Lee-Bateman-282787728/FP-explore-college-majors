8765507,2,B01HI8KC5E,"This movie makes the Jerry Springer Show look highbrow. It's poverty porn at its worst, and probably qualifies as actual porn. The PG rating seems to be an in-joke of some kind: X would be more fitting. Copious nudity (male and female), sexual activity (which seemed to be unsimulated), foul language (including racial slurs), and constant drug use. The high point (?) comes when a pregnant woman gets a shot (apparently of heroin) in her... um... chest area. You have to give the filmmaker some credit for somehow persuading these people (with money, probably) to allow themselves to be filmed doing these things. The filmmaker is Italian and his intention seems to be to make American culture look utterly degraded, while giving his audience some shocks, and he has certainly succeeded on both counts.",1471996800,6,803,5.0
