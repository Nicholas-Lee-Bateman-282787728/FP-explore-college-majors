7849652,5,6303515886,"As a Wheezer fan, this tape is perhaps my favorite of the Cabin Fever series.

Small Talk is the first short on the tape. It was the first of the Our Gang talkies and quite a good one at that. It centers around Wheezer who is adopted into a rich family. However, his older sister Mary Ann wants him back. The gang decides to help her win him back and in the midst gets into lots of trouble. It is similar to the silent Little Mother. However, it is set apart for being the first talkie.

Forgotten Babies is very funny and revolves around the adorable antics of tiny Spanky who has been forced to babysit (although he is just a baby himself). He tells the children stories and tries to prevent them from wrecking the house. Wheezer's little brother Dickie has a great running gag throughout the film in which he only says ""Remarkable"" about everything.

Bear Facts is a mediocre comedy starring the later gang with Alfalfa, Spanky, and Darla. Alfalfa tries to woo Darla, the circus owner's daughter, by bragging that he can hypnotize bears to do his will. Her father hears this and dresses as the bear while enjoying tricking the gang.

Baby Brother is great because it is a silent, it marks the first appearance of Wheezer, and it is genuinely funny. Joe plays a rich boy who wants nothing more than a baby brother. The gang invites him to share their baby siblings while using their inventive machine that takes care of babies. Oliver Hardy makes a cameo appearance.

Overall, this tape is a delight.",1121040000,2,1502,4.527675276752768
