3497938,5,B001BRYTEO,"How this great, well crafted film 'flew under the radar' is beyond me. The storyline and acting are absolutely first rate, and the holocaust subject matter, familiar, yet ultimately touching. Yet, it never gets tiring to hear stories of utter despair and resilience like this one, and how one man overcame (as much as he possibly could anyway) and moved on. The story was explained by several reviewers here, so I won't repeat it. Much of the film was shot in Greece (island of Hydra?) as well, so the scenery is beautiful. A 'must see'!",1361923200,4,537,4.663157894736842

8284419,5,B001BRYTEO,"a fantastic movie...  heartfelt, deep, shows a depth of human soul that is amazing.  Very few movies approach the quality of their source material, but in this case, it comes very close to the book in quality.  For length a major plot of the book was dropped,but the movie stands on it's own as a true work of art.  The movie is a bunch more upbeat than the book, but it's still a real tearjerker, have the tissues handy",1420675200,,420,4.2784810126582276

8284421,5,B001BRYTEO,"""Fugitive Pieces"" (2008) is a beautiful meditation on memory and healing, which is directed by Jeremy Podeswa (The Five Senses). The movie follows the life of Jakob Beer from his youth in WWII to his time in Canada where he meets the two important loves in his life. The movie sticks close to the poetic narration of the book, of the same name, by Anne Michaels.

The dvd is of fine quality, and has a director's and author's commentary, as well as an interview with the Producer Robert Lantos. Also included are deleted scenes.",1395446400,6,528,4.617021276595745
