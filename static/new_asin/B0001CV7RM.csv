8010166,4,B0001CV7RM,"As one of the other reviews indicated, aching for DVD release. Worked on the film, but never saw it due to its distribution and production woes. Liked the script and the cast expecting to enjoy the film, but it never came to a theater near me.",1461715200,,243,4.304347826086956

8010168,5,B0001CV7RM,"I watched this as a kid, and loved it... Now, as a professional airline pilot, it's even better.  Fantastic.",1447372800,,108,4.684210526315789
8010169,5,B0001CV7RM,"Terrific movie. Saw it years ago and still remember it. Cliff Robertson at his understated best. The doctor character was inspired and beautifully played by Milo O'Shea. This really needs to be released on DVD. Much better than the remake. You find yourself hoping the pilot with a problem can keep it secret. That's how good Robertson is. He was blacklisted for a time. When he won the Academy award, the director he was working with would not allow him time off to go to the ceremony. President Kennedy chose Robertson to play him in PT109.",1435968000,2,542,4.65625
8010170,5,B0001CV7RM,Hard movie to find but good.  I be believe they made a remake called Flight.,1427328000,,76,4.066666666666666
8010171,5,B0001CV7RM,I remembered this from years ago & remembered that it was good. It was! Great for aviation buffs. Some god photography of an old DC-8. I can't imagine a pilot these days having a 'serious' drinking problem. I hope I'm not wrong(?),1403740800,,230,4.5
8010172,5,B0001CV7RM,"Make no mistake, this movie is very different from any you have seen. It will stick in your memory. The proof? It's currently being remade as a Denzel Washington movie.  Cliff Robertson rides the fine line between good guy ace pilot and bad guy dangerous alcoholic. He nails it so well, that you end up not judgmental at all, but instead accepting him as the fallible human being he is. Bonus: the action sequences are nail biting, the flight sequences show the sheer joy of flying, and the emotional scenes are real and heartfelt.  Honestly, you couldn't write a more real, human story than this. Why hasn't it been made into a DVD? I have no idea, the time has never been better...",1350864000,8,683,4.544715447154472
8010173,5,B0001CV7RM,This movie tells it like it really is. You'll see first hand how it is to be an actual airline captain. In todays times this would have never happened. Captain Hagen would have been put into a treatment program and then released back to the line. This movie is one of the best and that's why it is a Classic even today.,1306713600,4,319,4.161290322580645
8010174,5,B0001CV7RM,"The Pilot is an excellent movie about an airline Captain who is a first rate pilot. The captain has to deal with his alcoholism throughout the film. He recognizes that indeed he has a problem and seeks the aid of a physician to help conquer this disease. The aircraft Cliff Robertson is flying is not a 737. Not hardly. It is in fact a DC-8. 737's have 2 engines, the dc-8 has four. Captain Hagen just about kicks his alcohol problem where at the end of the movie he is forced to abort a takeoff due to an engine fire. He is caught by his first officer who is a ""plant"" to try and catch Hagen with alcohol on his person while on duty. The flask of alcohol falls out of his coat pocket from the crew closet during the aborted takeoff. Hagen subsequently loses his job, but the movie has a happy ending. It is believed that Capt. Hagen kicks the reliance on alcohol and pursues his real passion in life....being a private pilot who does crop dusting. Very realistic cockpit procedures as Robertson was a pilot in real life. I truly enjoyed this film as I have been a private pilot.  Eric Hutchinson",1110844800,14,1096,4.3463414634146345
8010175,5,B0001CV7RM,"The Pilot is an interesting little movie about an alcoholic airline pilot. Little is paid to his home life, which might be for the better and quite a bit is held in the cockpit of what appears to be a Boeing 737. The main character is played by Cliff Robertson, who is seen going into the restroom of the airliner a lot during each flight, but this isn't due to a bladder problem, he goes in to get to his flask which he's carefully hid beneath the sink on each flight.

Keep in mind he's not a stumbling down drunk, at least most of the time. The guy's an excellent pilot and knows his business. He just has a problem with alcohol.

I really wish they'd bring this one out on DVD. For anyone that's a pilot or that flies as a passenger it's a good one to watch.",1102896000,19,762,4.10738255033557
