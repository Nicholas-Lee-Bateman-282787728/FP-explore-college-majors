8646259,5,B00IY1JBHA,"Found this unflinching look at the decay of Alzheimer very interesting.  The way the director set it up and edited it was beautiful.  It was uncanny at the end when the poets mind was almost gone and he's just making tonal noises then he looks right into the camera and says the most lovely poem or snippet of wisdom, then fades to insane babbling after.  Show how devastating the disease is.  I appreciate the honest look at the man, with all his warts.  I felt for his children, their pain long scarred over to the point they couldn't care anymore really, but you know they still do.  At least the man had the means to pay for in home care, looks top notch, not like the majority of cases sent to depressing homes and over worked staff if they are lucky.",1513814400,,756,4.326241134751773

8646261,5,B00IY1JBHA,"This is a very moving documentary about a man I studied with. It's sad to see him decline but it's wonderful that at least part of his spirit has been captured.
A very moving picture of a man who was one of my teachers. It is sad to see him decline but it is wonderful that some of his spirit is captured in this well crafted documentary.",1429747200,,338,4.059701492537314
8646262,5,B00IY1JBHA,"Edwin Honig was my professor at Brown. I used to go over to his place for bagels and discussions of translation and poetry. This film therefore touched me especially deeply. Very well done, from a clearly loving place, but also with enough objectivity to capture the ravages of Alzheimer's, especially on such a quicksilver mind. At the same time, I appreciated Berliner's fairness, in showing the many sides of Honig's personality, highlighting his intellectual gifts, while including his difficulty with emotional connection.",1429574400,,527,5.439024390243903
8646263,4,B00IY1JBHA,"I thought I might learn something about the progression of Alzheimers and its effects on the memory of a once extremely articulate poet so I found the film oddly frustrating since it is not linear and cuts back and forth and does not show much live footage of Honig when he was younger.  But any fault lies with my expectations (maybe it would be better to see a film with absolutely no preconceived ideas) since Berliner's intent was not to educate so much as to reveal a personal family story and, in that respect, he was successful.",1414540800,2,535,4.515463917525773
8646264,5,B00IY1JBHA,The gripping questioning of a great mind slipping into dementia is heartbreaking and strangely elevating.,1412985600,,105,6.066666666666666
8646265,5,B00IY1JBHA,"Talented and off-beat film-maker Alan Berliner documents the mind of his much older first cousin, the poet and translator Edwin Homing, as he slowly loses the battle against Alzheimer's.

Of course, any film about that subject can't help but be touching, but Berliner goes well beyond the obvious tragedy to raise questions of; what is memory, time, family?  We see and hear both the good and bad about this man, hear (and sometimes see) his poetry, hear the anger he put on his children as they were growing up, to end up not with a portrait of a disease victim, but of a man and an artist.  Berliner jumps around in time, so we see Edwin in bad and good moments.  In the end, this isn't a linear portrait of a man's decline, but an thoughtful and even darkly entertaining exploration of what is communication, thought, love.",1409011200,,826,4.598639455782313

8646267,5,B00IY1JBHA,"Our family is experiencing firsthand the ravages of Alzheimer's as our mom slowly slips away, little by little, on a daily basis. To state its an extremely emotional and confusing time doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what is happening to Mom and us.
This documentary gave me an lifeline, although threadbare, to grasp.  Watching the film, I came to realize as isolated as we each feel in our personal dealings with Alzheimer's and dementia, there are many similarities to what others are going through.  Selfishly, I feel gratefully bound to strangers who are also dealing with the hopeless inevitability of this awful disease.
The presentation style of the film honors the life's passion of poet and literary translator, Edwin Honig. Its a powerful glimpse into the mind's decline as the result of Alzheimer's Disease.",1397347200,3,832,5.065693430656935
