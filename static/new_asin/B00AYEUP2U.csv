8559183,5,B00AYEUP2U,"These are original television shows aired in the mid 50's, all these actors were MAJOR film stars early on, and some still made films at this time frame. As my study for classic film making, story telling, and unique acting abilities, this particular one is 5 star all the way! My two favorite on this DVD, Charles Colburn, he begins with a short narration of the storie presented then it flows right into it. It's about a elderly man being pushed to retire by his much younger employer executive, which he fibs about his age as he is not ready to retire just yet! I find Charles Colburn full of zest and his expressions are hilarious! He indeed had a style all his own, and youthful actors should seek out some of these older shows/movies, as Character acting doesn't seem to exsist anymore! Defiantly more pauses and it seems that actors expressed more facial expressions and hand and arm jesters. As if real.
The Joan Fontaine story, is a bit mistical an imaginary (which is what I like about it), as she rounds up four friends to participate in a wedding she wishes to occur at 11pm! The wedding which will take place in her very good friends laundry service, though her friends doubt her, as they begin to inquire about her mysterious fiance, which she admits she
""Wished"" for! Not to give away this really well acted story, her friends are all of different cultures and customs which really makes this such a loving unique piece! Will the baker come through with the wedding cake? Story is a bit out there, but I loved the characters and the acting style of this unique show. -The other 2 stories were ok. An if your into history you would enjoy them too. In overal, these shows are entertaining, slower cuts, but stories flow, really love camera angles too, another style that's gone away...
Very direct and clear language, David Niven is another fantastic English actor!
Pick this up, it's reasonable!",1505001600,,1909,4.6342182890855455
