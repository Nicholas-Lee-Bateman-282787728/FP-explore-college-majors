7032201,5,B00UARSZXC,Wonderful movie!,1436572800,,16,7.5
7032202,1,B00UARSZXC,"Boy was this movie a stinker. The holes in the story were enormous: the main character walks freely about someone else's house and takes their horses. The moody, roll-your-eyes teenager suddenly discovers she's ""the chosen one"". In visiting the castle she walks into the barn and immediately goes for the stall marked ""Do Not Enter"". Guess what!? She's the only one able to ride the wild horse. When caught by the stable hand, is she punished? No! Of course not! She's cheerily brought to the lady of the manor. She then spends the rest of the movie randomly breaking and entering and stealing horses without consequence. The vanquishing of the evil gold-digging fiance in the end is ridiculous. It seemed like maybe the movie made sense at some point, but was edited so that each scene just ended and went to the next with no continuity. I rented this as a family movie, and we did enjoy laughing at how bad it was. Mostly it was my kids making fun of me for spending money on it.",1436140800,,981,4.548022598870056
7032203,5,B00UARSZXC,A different kind of Irish movie. My sister bought this and told me about it. Lots of lovely Irish scenery and some magical Irish lore. Good for all ages.,1436140800,,153,4.310344827586207
7032204,1,B00UARSZXC,"Poor acting, lot of incongruent situations like the girl entering to the house of the old lady as she has a key, an old book that has new white pages. Not recommended",1434585600,,166,4.21875
7032205,5,B00UARSZXC,Enjoyable,1434240000,,9,9.0
7032206,4,B00UARSZXC,"It is not too common that a small production company makes a wonderful film with a nice story line, cast and nicely done overall. The Legend of Longwood is a wonderful dramatic story that will be enjoyed by most who sees it.

The main genre of this film is drama with a sense of adventure and fantasy thrown in. Also, they include from time to time a bit of comedy making the story enjoyable, yet thrilling.

The story begins when a young girl named Mickey (Lucy Morton) is torn away from New York where she lives with her family because they have to move to Ireland on almost the opposite side of the world. She arrives sad and depressed. To add to the problems of leaving New York, she leaves behind the memory of her passed away horse which is the only connection she has to her dad.  (If you want to find out more about he dad, you have got to watch the film!) She and her family settle in and she soon learns about a legend and starts a massive and dramatic adventure along with a discovery which leads to a very unexpected ending.

This film is a wonderful production with nicely executed shots and story plot. You never expect what happens so it is just a thrilling thing to watch. The director, Lisa Mulcahy, really excels at creating a compelling story with everything in perfect position. The only con I have is that the acting with some of the younger talent is a bit dull at times. Also, they move through conversations so fast that I missed important parts of the story, making me wondering what happened later.

My favorite scene is when a elderly lady tells Mickey the story of the, 'Mysterious Black Knight' which is a 300-year-old legend. It is shown through animated pictures and narration and becomes a very, if not the most, important part of the story.

This film really has nothing too mature for kids, so I recommend it for ages 9 to 18. I also give it 4 out of 5 stars because, although it is very nicely done in terms of directing, story and camera shots, it lacks somewhat in terms of acting skills and feels rushed at times.

great acting. keep me on the edge of my set on the last 30 mins of the movie",1496275200,,101,3.6363636363636362
7032237,5,B00UARSZXC,I actually enjoyed this very much. I don't usually watch movies like this but I am glad I caught this one. I'm not sure why I chose it. Probably because it has a castle in the background but I'm glad I did. It was a good story. Not great production value but it was a good story.,1496102400,3,279,3.912280701754386

7032240,5,B00UARSZXC,"Wonderful, more movies should be available like this one. The movie  and television industry have forgotten they need to provide entertainment and a story line of hope.

7032241,4,B00UARSZXC,"I previewed this movie prior to offering it to my children for movie night.  I think some of the Black Night scenes may be scary for the younger viewer, but overall the plot is well constructed and the actors/actresses were quite good.  I was truly pleased to have something to offer my family that had nothing to do with the usual ""Disney-esk"" children are in charge and adults are ineffective idiots.",1494028800,,402,4.647887323943662

7032244,5,B00UARSZXC,"Loved It!!!! The scenery was gorgeous. the story was wonderful, and the actors were fantastic! true the movie was a little slow, but the story and the plot more than made up for it. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again, and never get tired of it. What a find!",1492646400,,284,4.089285714285714
7032245,3,B00UARSZXC,"This is a very preteen movie that is lightweight even when dealing with weighty issues. It highlights some negative characteristics about its heroine (her sense of responsibility feels sanitized, she tends to break and enter a lot of places, and she's more willful than helpful) and makes the bad behavior of others seem playful. The story is vague and full of plot holes, the pace is snail slow, and the adults are alternatively witless and childish.
I'm giving it an overrated 3 stars because the photography is good and the actors do a professional job. I read some reviews, and true, the movie doesn't have profanity or engage in realistic violence. But in my opinion, the lack of those don't make a tepid film hot.",1490832000,,719,4.76
7032246,5,B00UARSZXC,"One of the best fantasy movie for those you are young at heart. Well worth the watch!!! Enjoy!!!!
I say to all don't ever go by anyone's review. Even though I say what I honestly feel and think, I'm
a firm believer in one should decide for themselves. What I might or mightn't like  might not be what
you do or don't. So I encourage you to read the reviews I've posted on various movies and check
them out yourselves. And after you do that, then you'll see. I'm a straight shooter. From the hip
Shooter let me know about you views on my reviews and what your opinions are on said movies.",1487980800,,587,4.1946902654867255

7032279,2,B00UARSZXC,"Well, it wasn't a total disaster. But it was close. Besides the beauty of the horse, Silver, there is not much to recommend here. The plot is meandering, bizarre and weirdly complicated. The actors did well enough, given their scripts, the ponies are cute and the countryside is picturesque. But it was a frustrating and unsatisfying crawl through a lot of nonsense and unsympathetic characters. The movie did little, and did it badly, with its low budget. Kids may enjoy it, but they will probably have no idea what happened either.",1484092800,,533,4.868131868131868

There is no gore but a bit of spookiness with the Black Knight, especially at first when you don't know what's going on. My 13 year old asked me if it was a 'horror' show, within the first 30 minutes, due to how things were portrayed. Its a decent family movie, however. I can't really recommend it for anything other than being more of a family movie and without gore, violence or sex.",1474761600,,521,4.2727272727272725

7032570,4,B00UARSZXC,"The movie quality was what one would expect from a second generation European film. However, we watched it as a family, and the way it was written, you had a definite character you could hate as well as others you could relate to, and it had wild horses in it with supposed magical qualities. My daughter who is sensitive was teary-eyed at some scenes and jumping up and down in her seat at others. however, The special effects were not fabulous but with what they did, there was still a mystery/suspenseful feel to the film. I wish that the plot had been more developed with backstory about the main female character's father and his departure overseas and then disappearance, and also her friend and his dad's history. Also I was hoping at the end to have more loose ends tied up like learning more about the Black Knight.. overall, we enjoyed the film and would recommend watching it, not to say over and over again but definitely worth at least once all the way through.",1471219200,3,974,4.571428571428571

It just seemed to happen instantaneously without much explanation. Worse still were the ''villains'' of the movie--the Mayor and Caitlin, the fiance. Caitlin seemed like a nasty woman, but certainly not murderous. So when her murderous intentions come about towards the end of the film, it doesn't make sense. And the fact that no one was concerned that she tried to murder anyone was bizarre as well. They laughed it off. What, no one is calling the police? Really?!! Bad.

7033202,5,B00UARSZXC,"A wonderful story collaboration between Irish and Dutch, that features beautiful scenery, horses, mystery, good acting and captivating family adventure.

Mickey Miller(well played by Lucy Morton), whose Irish dad has been missing in Egypt for 4 years, reluctantly moves from New York to the Irish countryside after her family inherits a mill.  Her mother(Dutch actress Thekla Reuten) and younger, slingshot fascinated, brother make the best of it, fixing up the ramshackle mill while trying to fit in.

Mickey loves horses and discover 7 white beauties, including the wildest one, Silver(Hi-ho!) at the nearby castle.  Unfortunately, the town is
haunted by the Black Knight, ancient owner of castle, and somehow, Mickey plays a role in that legend.

Everything is tip-top in this movie.  There's plenty of action and spooky, but not overbearing, mysterious going ons.  The actors are very good with fresh faces(however, if  a Harry Potter fan, you'll recognize Professor Sprout) and great outdoor shots with horses galore.

Our kids love horses and have been to Ireland, and give this flick a big thumbs up.  The extras include a making of featurette.  They shot 190+scenes in 6 weeks!  And the young actress knows how to ride.  Drama, comedy, a tiny bit of romance, and a villain to match Cruella DeVille!

Quality family fair, give us more!",1454284800,,1342,5.152777777777778

7033331,4,B00UARSZXC,"I liked it. I was confused with the beginning of the movie; we know from what we are shown that the horse didn't make the jump and main character fell but then the movie skips forward to the family's move to Ireland and doesn't tell you anything about that accident; or provide any sense of time between the accident and the move to Ireland; the appearance is that it was a short time. The leg brace tells us she was injured; but what happened to the horse? We were shown the second boat behind the first one and it left me to imagine the horse was seriously injured and probably had to be put down. For a sensitive young girl who loves horses this would have been terribly traumatic. The movie leaves one hanging with questions that could have been answered with a more developed opening scene and/or a written prompt telling the audience something like ""two years later"" which would be a reasonable amount of time for her to process and come to terms with the guilt she would have naturally felt by knowing her misjudgment caused the death of her beloved horse. I had to block out this inconsistently to enjoy the remainder of the movie.

No, it's not Disney, Dreamworks, or any other ""large"" corporation (at least not by American standards), but it was wonderfully casted, and interesting (sometimes even funny.) It seems to be based on some sort of Irish folklore, and a young girl from New York moves back with her family to a small town in Ireland and discovers she is the key to unlocking, and bringing an end to, a dark curse that has overshadowed that town.

You'll have to watch it yourself to discover the rest. If you keep an open mind, I don't think you'll be disappointed. :)",1451606400,2,697,4.576

7033426,3,B00UARSZXC,"I wanted to love, The Legend of Longwood, but I couldn't. It was a decent enough movie for the 10 - 12 crowd, But it didn't have that extra spark that reaches beyond it's intended audience. I'm a fan of foreign movies but this one missed several marks. There were some well known and accomplished actors but even they could not save the movie from its wooden lead. Perhaps English is a second language but the acting was tepid at best and dreadful at times.  The cinematography was incredible and showed Ireland to its greatest glory but the movie was overly long. With a well paced tale I never look at my watch - not so with Longwood.  It could use a good editor with the guts to overrule the director.
It's an okay pre-teen movie that you can let the kids watch without worrying they see some gratuitous violence or sex. However, the grownups should perhaps read a god book while watching with the kids",1449014400,,905,4.445783132530121

7033679,5,B00UARSZXC,"This was obviously a blatantly fantastical tween-targeted tale, true to the Irish Culture. With that in mind, I felt the dreams it might inspire far outweigh the possibility of expectations beyond reality. My tween has a great imagination and a great sense of reality (bolstered by my coaching). She loves to read, but this gave her in a movie that fantastical flight away from reality toward all the possibilities in the world. I could poo-poo the underlying overwhelmingly Cinderella themes in the story, but I won't. She enjoyed it with a light heart full of imagination. Lightening her heart means lightening her hopes. I loved that she loved it.",1447113600,,650,4.972477064220183

The acting is absolutely wooden and morose, the plot drifts from one pointlessly dreary trope to the next, even the cinematography is gray and confounding. Purportedly set in present-day Ireland, with confounding 300 year old flashbacks, there is no trace of ""Irishness"" in the set-up (here's a clue: there are no ""earls"" and ""barons"" and ""knights"" in Ireland), and there's not even a wisp of Irish brogue to be heard.  The entire endeavor is so hopelessly silly and lame, one can only wonder why it was made at all.",1446076800,,666,4.791304347826087

7034034,5,B00UARSZXC,"This was such a good movie! Although it is mystical, the faith of this little girl in her ability to break the curse is overwhelmingly pleasant. The way she gets around and disobeys adults and steals is not good, so morally it is corrupt on that end. I do not know how one could fight evil any other way though, in the matters concerning this movie. How do you get something that belongs to you that has been stolen when no one believes you but it is the lock that opens a world of the end of fear and sorrow? You will have to watch it for yourself, but even though it is a little corny, it is cute and shows how the love of a girl and her horse could protect so many.

The main character's mother lets her little girl go and do what ever she wants.  Example:  ride a wild horse out in the country and jump over things with no adult even knowing where she is.  This is just one example.  And some people think this is a good family movie.

The setting of Ireland is breathtaking, and watching the white horses run through fields is mesmerizing. The tale begins with a family moving from New York to Ireland, and our teen protagonist is less than pleased with this. There is some mysticism - fantasy - in the show, drama and a nice mystery to solve. The clues are actually large enough that the mystery is easy to solve, so no hardboiled detectives needed.

The mystery involves a 300-hundred-year-old legend of the Black Knight. The gorgeous seven white horses viewed throughout the movie are supposed to be murdered children. Don't worry folks, the legend is told in such a nice manner, even little kids should enjoy it without being too scared.

7034247,3,B00UARSZXC,"The Legend of Longwood is a pleasant enough children's movie -- the mystery works well enough to hold the attention and the setting in Ireland is lovely. Alas it is rife with stereotypes (the blond gold digger and her daughter are the worst) when better developed characters would have made for a richer story. Lucy Morton makes for a nice lead as Mickey, a courageous, horse-loving girl who is struggling with loss of her father and the difficulty of a move to a new (and very different) place . Brendan Conroy is excellent as Old Ben and we see too little of Miriam Margolyes as Lady Thyrza (too little for the character and too little for the plot). The run time is 99 minutes, which is a bit short for trying to work out all the pieces of the film.

The movie was beautifully filmed, with frightening spots, and a happy ending. I don't know if this showed at American movie theaters but it should have. Horse fans will like it. A little more of a chick flick as the heroine is female and saves the day with the help of a  stalwart male friend. Good values. Good triumphs over evil in the end.",1443571200,,518,4.820224719101123

For those who wish to stay away from magic-related themes, this movie is not for you. Less than 20 minutes in, I had to turn it off because it was too much for my 8 yr old. I wish I'd turned it off sooner at the first signs of occult themes (magic, circles, visions of the dead, etc).",1443484800,5,388,3.9240506329113924

It is nice to see an independent children's movie, and this has lovely scenery, interesting music and characters, and enough intrigue and peril to keep it interesting for the kids and adults.

7034581,4,B00UARSZXC,"Believable fantasy where a spunky American girl (aren't we all) and her family move to the missing dad's Irish homeland.  Irish lore - 7 white horses, a crone with a ""homespun"" looking wardrobe, a believable crypt, a sweet, good-guy stable man, a young, very attractive wicked witch who plans to sell the property, and some local kids, make for a terrific movie for preteen or teens.  I am neither, but I enjoyed it.  I seldom sit and watch a movie without a project.  That's what I did here, but if I had been watching it with a daughter or granddaughter, I would have watched without being bored.  Highly recommend for a mom/kid or grandma/kid evening on the sofa with a bowl of olive oil/sea salt popcorn and juice.  Well worth the time.

TEASER: Don't miss the wonderful moment when the younger brother comes through with his sling shot!!!

Good characterization.  Attractive kids.  Wonderful settings.  I won't give away the ending and whether the dad comes back, but it is a good ending..",1443225600,21,994,4.72093023255814

There are to many movies made today with darkness.
The good thing about this movie is goodness wins the day.
And there is happiness in the end of the story.
Other then that it was a good movie whether to allow little children to see it.
I would say no maybe 16 years and up and the horses we're just beautiful.
But Ireland is just beautiful anyway.",1443225600,,398,4.115384615384615

7034648,3,B00UARSZXC,"Typical chosen one motif. I have a writer friend who produced a much better storyline which includes a legend, girl from US going to Wales, the horse, etc. I liked her book better.

But for what it is (a young girl's fantasy with pretty horses) it was pretty good. I enjoyed the selfish bitches (c'mon, her name is Chardonnay?) getting their comeuppance. I think the black knight looked more like Zorro (see the hat?) than an Irish Lord.

As I said, good enough for me to watch the whole thing, but not good enough to recommend to anybody.",1442880000,,539,4.489795918367347
7034649,5,B00UARSZXC,"The Legend of Longwood is one of those gems I stumbled upon while perusing the offerings on Amazon Prime.  As the story develops, there are increasingly strong hints that something quite mystical and mysterious is going on, and it doesn't stint on the big payoff at the end.

It's perfectly good for kids to watch, though I really hadn't thought of it as a children's story until I read others' reviews on Amazon.  Indeed, the horses are beautiful.  They reminded me of these scenes of the horses at Beorn's house in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, with the difference that the magnificent animals get a lot more screen time in The Legend of Longwood and they play a key role in the plot.

Keep watching the beginning of the credit crawl; you'll be glad you did.",1442793600,,767,4.569343065693431

They used to live in New York and Mickey is having a difficult time adjusting to the move.  But one bright point for Mickey is her mother's job gives her access to the estates stables.  The estate and the nearby village also are cursed and Mickey has a connection to the curse.  It sort of reminds me of ""The Canterville Ghost"".

I won't give any more spoilers but I think this movie is well made, the acting was good, and well it just worked for me.  It was free with Amazon Prime so no complaints related to the price.",1442361600,6,662,4.333333333333333

7034703,2,B00UARSZXC,"A great story badly directed. Too many holes being filled after the moment and too many weird leaps to the next thing without building a logical basis for the leap. The young girl protagonist goes from passive to gutsy and is best when gutsy -- about three great lines in the movie indicated they had a writer but someone didn't listen to them. To uncritical children, this movie could be a fun watch -- but why not show them a movie worth seeing in the first place?",1441497600,,466,4.367816091954023
