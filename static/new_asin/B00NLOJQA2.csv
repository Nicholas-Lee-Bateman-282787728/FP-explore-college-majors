6667090,5,B00NLOJQA2,"This is an unusual little film starring George Arliss as master concert musician Monty Royale whose young pupil Grace (Bette Davis) confesses her love to him. He's of course flattered but unsure of what the coming years will bring considering their age difference. He agrees to marry her if she feels the same in six months. However, near the beginning of the six month period something happens that leaves Monty unable to enjoy his own music - he is left completely deaf from an explosion. He becomes a bitter man who shuts himself away from everyone. He does take some training in learning to read lips so that he can deal with the world in his new condition, and this training leads him to realize that he now has the means to bring happiness to people in a different and more individualized way than he could as a musician. With the aid of some powerful binoculars left behind by Grace, he can read the lips of the people in the park across the street, learn their troubles, and with his large family fortune and influence, save lives or maybe just bring someone some welcome happiness.

Soon the joy of living has reentered Monty's life, and he is happy that the six month waiting period is soon to end and Grace will be returning from California - they can be wed. He's people watching at his window when Grace suddenly appears in the park across the street. She sits down with someone and begins to have a conversation. Monty ""listens in"". What will he discover and how will he react? Watch and find out.

In addition to the fine work of George Arliss and Bette Davis, the supporting roles are well played here too. Ivan Simpson is great as Monty's gentleman's gentleman who has no trouble sternly lecturing his master when he needs it, yet is such a formal person that he cannot leave the house -even on an urgent errand - without his hat, and there is even a very small part played by a very young Ray Milland. Highly recommended for fans of early 30's films. It has some precode elements in it, particularly the part where Monty is wrestling with God and his loss of belief, but I would not call it a precode at all.",1436572800,2,2126,4.47680412371134
6667091,5,B00NLOJQA2,"This movie is one of Arliss's best! He gave Bette Davis her start in this movie because he believed in her talent even as young as she was then, and remember this was 1932! His range of emotion in it is astounding, proving he was one of the very best actors of his time.

If anyone wishes to become an Arliss fan, here's a great way to begin!",1424131200,6,342,4.029411764705882
6667092,5,B00NLOJQA2,"This was a Christmas present. It was also a huge surprise because I didn't know it had been released to DVD.
The plot is fairly simple. Montgomery Royle is a famous concert pianist who has gone deaf.....stone deaf. His career is over and he is despondent. His fianc&eacute;e (in a career saving role compliments of Mr. Arliss) is the one and only Bette Davis. To occupy his time, Montgomery learns lip reading and actually becomes a benign voyeur via binoculars. He reads the lips of people meeting in the park across from his swank penthouse. It is interesting and it sets the pace for his character. Montgomery is a really sweet man and a noble one. One day he sees his fianc&eacute;e meeting a man she has fallen in love with. She refuses to leave Montgomery because he needs her more than ever. The cat is let out of the back and he releases his fianc&eacute;e to marry the man she loves.
The story is simple and also on the face of it a little improbable due to casting. Arliss wasn't young and didn't look very healthy. Casting him in this part really didn't make sense, but his talent and the power of his performance is incredible. Oddly, Davis is good in this movie but she wasn't the dynamo audiences would come to know a couple of years later. Still her portrayal rang true and there is something about this movie that is powerful and absolutely convincing.
Though not remastered this is a clean print that is easy to watch. The sound is good.
This movie is yet another example of why Arliss managed to have a long and productive career.",1423008000,5,1548,4.512455516014235

6667095,5,B00NLOJQA2,"One of the items on my bucket list is to see all of Bette Davis' feature films.  I picked a good time to do this with the proliferation of her earlier films being released through the Warner Archive Collection. Having seen about 80 of her films so far, I am aware of what a range of quality exists in Davis' films, although I am delighted with every one.  I was not expecting much with this film, although I am aware of the status of George Arliss at the time it was filmed, as well as this movie being a turning point in Bette's career.  I was pleasantly surprised not only with the performances, but also the storyline.  It exceeded my expectations by a great deal.  Also, the sound and picture quality on this dvd was quite good.  I have many of the Warner Archive dvds, which run the gamut as far as picture quality goes.  This was above average, especially considering the age of the film.  Also, the sound was clear and less muffled than other early sound era films I own.",1412899200,11,978,4.335164835164835

8678920,4,B00NLOJQA2,"THE MAN WHO PLAYED GOD is a much better film than synopses & reviews indicated.  An awestruck fan of Bette Davis, I often replay a film to get past the first deep breaths of just gazing at her, watching her work.  I love many of her earlier films from the 30s & 40s (OF HUMAN BONDAGE, DANGEROUS, DARK VICTORY, THE OLD MAID, THE LETTER, THE LITTLE FOXES, IT'S LOVE I'M AFTER, THE BRIDE CAME C.O.D., WATCH ON THE RHINE, DECEPTION, and her two (so far) most sublime: ALL THIS, AND HEAVEN TOO and NOW, VOYAGER), plus a pair from the 50s (THE STAR and ALL ABOUT EVE).  THE MAN WHO PLAYED GOD was an unexpected & entrancing addition to this list.  So many of her films, though, which I haven't yet seen.  Please load more of her films for rental viewing.",1475798400,,748,4.276595744680851

8678924,4,B00NLOJQA2,"The Man Who Played God is a 1932 drama that gives us two of the finest (and campiest) actors of the first half of the 20th Century  George Arliss and Bette Davis.

The film is an adaptation of the 1922 silent version in which Arliss played the same role.

George Arliss (1868-1946) plays a concert pianist gone deaf who must re-evaluate his life. He was a major star on the stage and in the silent and the early talkie period, with films like Disraeli (1921 and 1929), Alexander Hamilton (1931), and Voltaire (1933). He won the Academy Award for Disraeli (1929) and was nominated again for The Green Goddess (1930).

Arliss was so well regarded by Warner Bros. the title refers to him as Mr. George Arliss. Not only in the title, but Warners was so happy to have Arliss he was given creative powers over his films that no one else had and he worked with Darryl Zanuck in recruiting stars like James Cagney, Randolph Scott, and Dick Powell. But Arliss major casting coup may have been his insistence that Bette Davis co-star in this film.

According to AFI Bette Davis (1908-89) is the #2 female screen legend, and she was the first actress to ever achieve an AFI Lifetime Achievement Award. She received her first wave of critical acclaim for Of Human Bondage (1934) and followed that with Oscar wins in Dangerous (1935) and Jezebel (1938). She appeared in nearly 100 films, was nominated for an Oscar 11 times between 1935 and 1962, nominated for an Emmy 4 times and won once (Strangers in 1979), 3 Golden Globe Nominations, and for All About Eve (1950) she won awards at Cannes, in Italy, and the New York Film Critics.

But in 1932 Davis career seemed over. Carl Laemmie at Universal Studios was not happy with her failed performances in her first 6 films - The Bad Sister (1931), Seed (1931), Hells House (1932) - and said she had as much sex appeal as Slim Summerville. He terminated her contract and she was headed home, when Arliss intervened and convinced Warner Bros to use her in this film.

In addition to Arliss and Davis, this film gives us excellent performances from Violet Heming (as a suitor for Arliss), Louise Closser Hale (Arliss sister and confidant), and Ivan Simpson (Arliss manservant).

Heming (1895-1981) was a British stage actress who worked with Arliss. She made few films (part of Thanhouser) and is best known for her stage work, which is unfortunate for the rest of us since her acting is really exceptional.

Hale (1872-1933) combined a grandmotherly spirit with a quick wit and sometimes tart edge in supporting roles (Daddy Long Legs, Shanghai
Express, Platinum Blonde) and her skill is probably nowhere better on exhibit than in this film.

Simpson (1875-1951) was a Scottish stage and film actor who worked with Arliss during the silent era. He made more than 100 films and later transitioned to TV. He was used extensively in the British dramas (Prince and the Pauper, Lloyds of London, Captain Blood, Mutiny on the Bounty). This is probably the best example of his considerable talents, and the chemistry between he and Arliss is a joy to watch.

Look for Ray Milland (uncredited) in a brief scene in which he plays a man threatened with prison. For Milland (1907-86) this was his 15th film and fame was still a few years ahead. Ultimately he won an Oscar for The Lost Weekend (1946).

Also look for Hedda Hopper (1885-1966) as a west coast society matron. She is better known for her gossip columns, but she did, in fact, appear in over 100 films between 1916 and 1946.

The film is directed by John Adolfi (1886-1933) who worked on many of Arliss films.

The NT Times said  ""It is a neatly conceived story as it comes to the screen, with effervescent cheer in the introductory sequences, then a period of melancholy, and finally episodes of thankfulness and happiness . . . and while it seems a little lethargic at times, it has such a genuinely gentle and appealing touch that one would not wish it to be told any faster.""

1932 was a good year for films  Grand Hotel was the Oscar and box office king, but Jean Harlow had 2 films in the top 10 (Red Headed Woman and Red Dust) as did Miriam Hopkins (Trouble in Paradise and Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) and Wallace Beery (Champ and Grand Hotel). Other notable films from that year were I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, Freaks ,A Farewell to Arms, Scarface, Horse Feathers and Tarzan The Ape Man.

Though the film has much to recommend it, it isn't perfect. Its a bit too long and the sex appeal between Davis and Arliss is a bit strained. Davis was 24 (she says 25 in the film) and Arliss was 65 (though he plays a 50 year old in the film), so their full frontal kisses look a bit worrisome. At one point Arliss introduced her as his granddaughter and there is nary a blink. The age difference probably made more sense a decade earlier when Arliss filmed the silent version.

Also, Arliss cant help but revert back to his silent days on occasion, and there are several close-ups of Arliss staring directly into the camera that are reminiscent of days gone by.",1442102400,,5048,4.582685904550499
