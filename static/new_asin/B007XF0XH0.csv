5113891,2,B007XF0XH0,I wish the video would have spent more time on the health aspects of a vegan diet and less on the environment and animal issues.,1348963200,10,128,4.16
5113892,3,B007XF0XH0,"It was a well-produced documentary and is a great way for starting the conversation about what we're eating and how it affects us and the planet as a whole.  However, if you've seen some of the bigger films in this category (""Forks Over Knives"", ""Food, Inc."", etc.) then this is going to be mainly a rehash of what you've already heard.",1347580800,33,336,4.508196721311475
5113893,5,B007XF0XH0,"Since Fork over Knives last year, I went from being a vegetarian to 100% vegan and love the results.  I feel great every day... clear and light.  As a huge fan of Dr T. Colin Campbell (his book, ""the China Study"" is also a must read) and his efforts to promote Plant-based Nutrition, I support all of his consumer informational products that help us understand the importance of this way of eating and living.  The more I read and see about affects of this lifestyle, more I know how important it is to share and spread this message... to save not only our lives, but the lives of all other earthlings and our planet for future generations.",1347148800,31,640,4.452991452991453
5113894,5,B007XF0XH0,"I received a review copy, and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's up there with other excellent and inspiring nutrition documentaries like Forks over Knives, Fat Sick & Nearly Dead, Food Inc., etc. Planeat is the perfect film to give to friends who are 'foodies', but not yet convinced that a plant-based way of eating can be delicious and even sophisticated. The evidence that this way of eating is just as tasty, plus  healthier for the individual and the planet, is overwhelming. And the descriptions of interesting restaurant recipes are tantalizing. Thanks for a terrific documentary.",1345507200,57,589,5.2
5113895,5,B007XF0XH0,"I also saw Planeat as part of a film festival that Whole Foods put on in 2011.  It started me on a wonderful journey into the world of plant based eating and the incredible health benefits associated with the program.  I've since read many other books and viewed other videos covering the same topic and have now switched to a plant-based eating program and feel terrific.  If you are looking to improve your health and do something good for our planet, this video is the perfect place to start on your journey.  You won't be disappointed.",1336608000,59,539,4.583333333333333
5113896,5,B007XF0XH0,"I first saw Planeat as part of a film festival that Whole Foods put on. I was vaguely aware of the benefits of a plant-based diet, but I had no idea that eating plants can reverse heart disease and arrest cancer growth. The film is a real eye-opener for those not already aware of the work of doctors T.Colin Campbell and Caldwell Esselstyn (Bill Clinton's heart doc), but also focuses on the benefits to the planet from reducing our intake of animal protein. It shows how plant-based diets can mean eating amazing food, with top chefs like Chad Sarno from Whole Foods and the team at New York's Pure Food & Wine, among others, demonstrating amazing recipes for healthy, plant-based eating. I've gradually changed my diet to a being mostly plant-based and it feels great and tastes great. Highly Recommended.",1335830400,120,808,4.7785714285714285

5113915,5,B007XF0XH0,"Loved it!  It had similar information to Forks over Knives, which also featured Dr. T. Colin Campbell PhD and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyne MD, but it went beyond in a few areas.  For one thing, the producers did a number of interviews in the kitchens of vegan and raw vegan restaurants, with the camera delivering close-ups of mouth-watering gourmet vegan dishes  as the chefs described the dishes and their approach to food.  This really helps people see that vegan can be amazingly tantalizing and good.  In addition to introducing the benefits of a vegan diet for reversing cardiovascular disease and preventing cancer (via the research of Drs. Esselstyne and Campbell), the filmmakers also interviewed scientists to help explain the harm an animal-product based diet causes to the environment, and the benefits of switching to a plant-based one.  Great film.  I will recommend it!",1445385600,2,879,5.147887323943662

5113942,4,B007XF0XH0,"Really liked this documentary.  It gave me a lot to think about.  The concepts were presented well, and I was amazed at the information provided and how a few fairly simple changes can change our lives and the planet. I believe we have a responsibility to be good care takers of our areas of responsibility on this planet.  I know just one person can't change the whole world, but Meatless Mondays are already making an impact on our environment.  Truly, I would have scoffed at this three years ago.  Now, I am coming from a different place in my life - eating a grain/plant based diet - I feel SO much better!  And I can see how my choices are a little more long-reaching than I originally thought.",1440374400,,700,4.4296875

5113949,4,B007XF0XH0,"The most compelling aspect of the film were the medical claims. Patients reversed vascular disease by eating a vegan type diet.  A 52-year old study patient who had 30% blocked coronary  artery returned to being healthy - as was shown by comparing angiography after several years on the plant based diet.  A 44-year old physician who  after a heart attack, had an angio showing a very unhealthy ""moth eaten"" coronary artery.  This patient  refused statins but agreed to try a plant-based diet.  His repeat angio after 30 months showed a  healthy, completely clear coronary artery.  Later, Dr. Esselstyn
's wife is cooking in their kitchen and says ""did we give up oil in '84 Essy?""  Esselstyn
goes on to say processed oils, dairy and animal protein of every kind including fish, damage endothelial cells - those are the cells that line our blood vessels.  Dr. Campbell claims the high cholesterol diet acts like ""fertilizer"" to create a bodily environment where cancer can grow and thrive.",1437609600,,989,4.933333333333334

You may not agree with everything it says, but I assure you that it will provide food for thought (sorry, I couldn't resist). It is available at Netflix and may be at Amazon Prime. It may even be at your local library waiting for you to check it out. Host a movie night and invite friends to eat organic popcorn cooked in organic coconut oil (you will barely if at all taste the coconut flavor).

So why am I encouraging to watch it?  This gentle film kindly informs you about concerning issues",1418860800,,621,4.43859649122807

5113974,5,B007XF0XH0,Going to Dr. Esselstyn's speech this month. This is a true  eye opener for everybody who relays on main stream medication to treat cardio vascular disease rather then eat healthy to prevent it from happening at the first place.

5113976,5,B007XF0XH0,Here is another compelling DVD discussing the pros of Plant based diets and the cons of the animal based diets. The key is Whole Plant Based Food - not the animal and processed foods that are advertised so extensively.

5113984,5,B007XF0XH0,"This documentary gives a great summary of plant-based eating, however it is similar to some of the others out there such as Forks Over Knives (and includes some of the same people). In my opinion, Forks Over Knives gives a better overall look at the research behind plant-based diets for health and PlanEat gives more information about the environment (still includes much about health though). Overall, this was a very interesting and well-made documentary and I love that it includes a lot of restaurants/chefs to give a good idea of what plant-based eating can actually look like. 5 stars.",1388793600,2,592,4.98989898989899

It overlaps quite a bit with another similar documentary, Forks Over Knives, but there was enough that was different that it made this movie worthwhile to watch as well.

I enjoyed it because I'm interested in eating better, being more environmentally conscious, and because I admire some of the people who appear in the film. However, it was nothing new or astounding if you've already seen Forks Over Knives. For me, that was a really eye opening film. This seemed like a follow up (or an afterthought) to FOK.

Yes, much of same info rehashed from Forks Over Knives but am glad finally the perspective of the negative effects of an animal-based diet on our environment is covered also.

Although honestly, I don't suggest veganism as a true health diet. If you are doing it for spiritual reasons then sure, but watch ""The Perfect Human Diet,"" this is a FABULOUS documentary and will help you understand that eating animal products is not a fad, it's propelled the human species to have larger brains, live better, and evolve. Also read the book by Leirre Keith called, ""The Vegetarian Myth.""
