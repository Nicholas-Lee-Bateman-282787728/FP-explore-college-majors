Pia Nilsson and Lynn Marriott's Golf54 Process is proven and I will try to incorporate all their advice but this video is not as good as their book. The way the video is shot is distracting and unprofessional looking. Interviews are in an awful room with the most distracting horizontal wallpaper. They use average golfers in the drills, lumps and all (I have lumps too but I do not want to see them in a golf video). Their book ""Every Shot Must Have A Purpose"" is more complete, save your money and buy the book.",1142985600,4,530,4.408163265306122
