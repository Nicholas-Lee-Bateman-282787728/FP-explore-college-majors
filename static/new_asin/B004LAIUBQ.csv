4400981,5,B004LAIUBQ,"This documentary is a very moving account of the journey of immigrants from Central America that try to make it to the US. The total lack of concern of the Mexican government for these populations, leaving them the targets of narcos, robbers and rapists (or simply of the train itself), is totally revolting. At the same time, the help provided on the way by anonymous people to these immigrants is admirable.
Good class material, if it weren't for the controversial nature of the topic itself, of course.",1357948800,8,505,4.816091954022989

4400984,5,B004LAIUBQ,"Siempre tuve el inters de ver este Documental, por conocer la realidad de los Inmigrantes centroamericanos, me pareci cruda y real los echos de los que narran las personas, de las cosas que pasan me es casi increble soportar el trato de estas personas de su propio gente tnica, pero la verdad, esta en el documental, no creo que se hallan agregado cosas falsas para ser mas emotivo, por lo tanto me despierta la compasin y la comprensin de todos nuestro hermanos Americanos para luchar ya sea aqu en EE.UU., o en nuestros pueblos por la lucha a una vida mejor de igualdad y respeto a nuestros semejantes donde quiera que estemos.

En resumen creo que doy 5 estrellas para alentar a que la gente vea y sea consciente de los echos, as como a mi mismo, a dar un mejor trato a todas las personas y dar recomendacin de que fue un buen trabajo documental. gracias",1332979200,9,857,4.45859872611465
4400985,5,B004LAIUBQ,"You would has to live it to believe it, I did exactly, what this documentary has, but I did not knew there where shelters all over, I was one of those who just had to live and went.

I have been here for almost 30 years, I'm a citizen now, work really to get it, is a lifetime work, I just got it in setp 21st 2011.

Every time I try to tell my American friends or anyone who is not from central america, what you has to do to get here, they think you have been watching too many rambo movies.

It is hard to explain, because your mind can not compute the trip, then I found this, and is much eaiser for me to pop it in and say this is ""WHAT I HAD TO DO TO GET HERE"", you can use as an educational material, or just to see what you has to do to get here.

I still get tears on my eyes and I feel guilty that I'm here and every second that pass people are jumping trains and risking their lives, to reach the so call  ""THE PROMISE LAND"".

as someone ask, why can they follow to what happen to this people... if you been there, it is so many of them thousands of them, I for one would love to find out the address of the gentlement who had his harm cut off, and still trying to make it here, i wish I knew how to help him...

if anyone knows where he is at his address, I would like to help...

Once you get here.. well that is a different story, is actually worse thant when you are on the train..
I was there.. being an ilegal in the great USA, is not a really good thing...
trust me
