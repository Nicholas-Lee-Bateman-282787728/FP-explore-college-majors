8604389,3,B00EE12GHG,"Some of the better Westerns ever made are represented in this 5-disc bluray collection that comes attractively packaged in two standard plastic cases housed in a cardboard slipcase at an attractive price.  However, the picture and sound quality varies sharply from disc to disc which is a disappointment.  ""Pale Rider"" is excellent with very good picture and sound quality and all in all is the best film here.  ""The Wild Bunch"" is decent but as far as blurays go isn't all that impressive and truth be told is not one of my favourite Westerns to begin with; it's highly overrated in my opinion but ranks third best overall taking picture, sound and overall content into account. ""Rio Bravo"" is the biggest disappointment given the picture and sound quality is relatively poor when compared with the two films above and it's one of my favourite Westerns of all time.  No faulting the content but there are many imperfections such as dust and spots on too many frames and the mono sound quality on a blu ray with many action shots on show does disappoint.

""How the West Was Won"" is the worst of the lot with barely above average content and while the sound quality is pretty decent the picture quality is poor as the original three-panel join lines are very visible making it severely distracting for the viewer throughout.  ""The Searchers"" is the second best film here with great content, very good picture quality but with only a mono soundtrack.  For this reason given the good content and great picture and sound quality ""Pale Rider"" stands out as the best of the 5 blu rays here.  While these are not the best ever Westerns this is a nice group to have in your video library alongside the true greats such as ""High Noon"", ""Shane"" and ""Unforgiven"" for example.

Overall this is a good idea however the execution in terms of inconsistent picture and sound quality and actual selection of titles makes this a mixed bag.",1412726400,,1921,4.71044776119403
