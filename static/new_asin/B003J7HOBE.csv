4129338,5,B003J7HOBE,"Elaine Page at her very best. Filmed in the beautiful State Theatre, Sydney, Australia, it is an absolute joy to watch. Fans of Elaine will certainly treasure this special DVD. She is definately the First Lady of the Theatre. Diane Lovett",1281484800,6,238,4.829268292682927
4129339,5,B003J7HOBE,"I just finished watching a superb performance by the First Lady of Musical Theater. This concert captures a lifetime of accomplishments by Ms. Paige, and is memorable on many levels.  Memories, indeed.... Elaine has never been more beautiful, nor has her voice been clearer or more dynamic. Elaine Paige does not merely sing songs- she lives them, and acts them.  Her songs have stories to tell, and passion behind them.  No exceptions.  I found the bonus interview a nice enhancement, and hearing firsthand how some of the songs and shows came about are fascinating in their own right.  Long live the Queen!",1280620800,7,608,4.921568627450981
4129340,5,B003J7HOBE,"I have been eagerly waiting for the U.S. release of Elaine Paige's Celebrating 40 Years on Stage.  Wow -- what a stunning performance by the first lady of British musical theater!  She is truely an actress on stage which makes the performance even more exciting. And, I believe as she matures, the quality of her voice is even better -- there is a sassy quality about her stage performance. So many have sung the lead roles in Cats, Evita, Hair, Chess, Sunset Boulevard -- but she sang most of them first in London's West End and on Broadway.  No one sings ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina,"" ""Memory"" and ""I Know Him So Well,"" like Elaine does.  She pours her heart into every aspect of this performance, which was filmed in Sydney.  The interviews were excellent -- added to the entire DVD.  Well done Elaine! Please perform in America.",1279929600,15,832,4.587837837837838
4129341,5,B003J7HOBE,"I've just finished watching this, and all I can say is, ""Wow!"" After a career spanning forty years, Ms. Paige is still in glorious voice, with a relaxed-yet-total command of the stage. If you bought the CD, you still have to get the DVD as there are several songs and passages that were not included (also, the CD is not taken from this concert -merely the same playlist). Brilliant as she is, Elaine is not well known in the US, as she was never given the opportunity to take the roles she made famous in London (Eva Peron in Evita; Grizabella in Cats; Florence in Chess) to Broadway. She finally arrived in New York to breathe life into Sunset Blvd. for its final year on Broadway.

The songlist is mostly classic:
Overture
Life Goes on
Tomorrow
Easy To Be Hard
Broadway Baby
I Don't Know How To Love Him
Small Packages
Hello Young Lovers
Shoot The Breeze (by Dustin Hoffman and Bette Midler)
Yesterday
Don't Cry For Me Argentina
As If We Never Said Goodbye
By The Sea
I Get A Kick Out Of You
I Dreamed A Dream
Someone Else's Story
I Know Him So well
Poor Old John
Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien
If You Love Me
Cry Me A River
Memory
With One Look

There are bonus features, including a behind-the-scenes interview, and she performs with a first-rate orchestra. Especially notable are her performances of songs from Sunset Blvd. and Piaf in character and costume. Stunning!

If you love musical theatre and/or classic vocalists then you'll fall in love with Elaine Paige. If, like me, you're a long-time fan -You'll fall in love all over again.",1279756800,26,1539,4.508960573476703
4129342,5,B003J7HOBE,"Elaine Paige's name is not a household word in the US though she's played many roles on Broadway. But in London's West End, where she originated many of the roles in Andrew Lloyd Webber's productions, she's a huge star. When a lot of ALW's shows transferred to the US, Paige stayed on and an American actress took over the role. Think Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Sunset Boulevard. She is probably best known in the US from appearing in Chess and Cats.

Its been 40 years since she first stepped on a West End stage - a last-minute fill-in for a lead role in Hair. And to celebrate those 40 years she presented a concert - not in London, but at the State Theater in Sidney, Australia. The 1- hour long show consists of more than her hits. For some reason she sings ""Tomorrow"" from Annie, a show she didn't appear in, and later ""I Dreamed A Dream"" from Les Miz, the role she turned down to take a role in Chess instead! There is also some ""special material"" written for her about her vertically challenged frame (she's admittedly short) and the oddball song """"Shoot The Breeze"" which was written by her friends Dustin Hoffman and Bette Midler (yes, they write songs). The ""Hits"" are here too - songs from Sweeney Todd, Evita, Piaf, Chess, Sunset Boulevard.  And she still sounds great after 40 years.

The bonuses on the DVD include one outtake (""Grow Young"") and a 33-minute interview. The interview is not all talk. Paige usually repeats a story you heard during the concert and parts of the concert performance as blended into the interview so its fairly repetitive.

Paige fans - and I know there are many of them - will want this DVD for their collection. Theater fans in the US will enjoy hearing her perform her versions of songs sung by others on Broadway and hearing what the original lead actress sounded like when the shows premiered in London.

4129358,5,B003J7HOBE,"Not only does Ms Paige have a wonderful voice, she knows when to sing softly and when to belt. No diva grandstanding here. She is always true to the lyrics of whatever she is singing. The song is always more important to Ms Paige than whether she proves to us or not that she can belt.  This is so important and many singers miss this mark.
She has been a ""star"" for forty years and the professionalism she has gained over those years is evident.
Everything she sings, she knocks out of the ballpark and, frankly, once she sings it, a song belongs to her.
She is every bit as good an actress (if not better) as she is a singer.  This is a killer combo.",1296172800,9,652,4.166666666666667
4129359,5,B003J7HOBE,"A great overview of a great career. Elaine sings all that you would expect and some great surprises,such as Cry Me A River. Concert is supplemented with a great interview.

8397919,5,B003J7HOBE,"wonderful taping of a live concert in a beautiful theatre in Australia....although not a big Elaine Paige fan I did grow to like her more watching this performance...she was always a bigger star in the UK than here in New York City. But the highlight for me was when she went off stage to do a costume change and came back in her costume as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard and sang songs from the show...she did it again with Piaf and after doing an onstage wig, makeup change she was Piaf singing three of her most famous songs. I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the Broadway/West End musicals as well as anyone wanting an enjoyable evening in the theatre with a talented singer/actress/personality.",1436659200,,713,4.666666666666667

8397924,4,B003J7HOBE,"This CD is an excellent review of the 40 year career of the ""First Lady"" of British musicals, Elaine Paige, minus her later role in Follies in the States and her duet with Susan Boyle. It covers everything from 1968 - 2008 with stories of life in the theater in between.
