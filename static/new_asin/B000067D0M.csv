1713771,5,B000067D0M,"Some of the best Popeye cartoons have been gathered here (""Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp,"" ""Popeye Meets Sindbad,"" ""Popeye Meets Ali Baba,"" ""Li'l Sweet Pea,"" and ""Customer's Wanted.) All of the cartoons have been on higher priced Cartoon Crazys editions. They all look the same (mixed bag) and have the same overblown stereo sound.
The extra included here is a good, old newsreel about the making of Popeye cartoons. While it does not contain the extensive production notes and reading lists of the Cartoon Crazies volumes, some may still find the newsreel preferable.
And at this price, you can't go wrong.",1044403200,,608,5.02970297029703
1713772,4,B000067D0M,"Yea - the quality could be a lot better. But this is Popeye's best stuff. Especially the two-reelers.
This was the Fleischer brothers firing with both barrels - trying to convince the studio that a movie length cartoon was feasible.
The movie never quite worked out for them. But the cartoons are pure gold.
You can pick them up on the cheap now, or keep waiting till who knows when.",1043193600,,383,4.485714285714286
1713773,4,B000067D0M,"It's true. The majority of those great 30's Popeye cartoons are being held up for release because King Features and Turner can't come to terms. Yeah? Well here's your terms: YOU AIN'T GONNA MAKE NO MONEY TIL YA RELEASE 'EM! Now, on with this DVD. Some of the reviewers don't give it enough stars in my opinion. The only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because of the lousy color on the first three cartoons, there ain't ENOUGH cartoons and the cover art could've been better. But, with all the flaws, flawed vintage Popeye is better than NO Popeye. The two black-and-white cartoons (""Li'l Swee'Pea"" and ""Customers Wanted"") actually look better than the color films (Sindbad, Forty Thieves, and Aladdin). I bought this DVD while lying in wait for the entire Fleischer collection. It'll have to do...you ain't gonna find a better one til then!",1037318400,6,850,4.7114093959731544
1713774,2,B000067D0M,"What we have here is yet another sub-par Popeye DVD release.  Granted,  ""Popeye: When Popeye Ruled the Seven Seas"" collects some classic Popeye cartoons.  ""Popeye Meets Sinbad the Sailor,"" ""Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamps"" and ""Popeye Meets Ali Baba And His Forty Thieves"" are amongst the best Popeye cartoons ever made.  Because of this, they are included on nearly every Fleischer Popeye collection on DVD.  Here they are again.
The disc also includes two black-and-white Popeye cartoons, ""Little Swee'Pea"" and ""Customers Wanted,"" both also available on other Popeye DVD collections.  Both are great cartoons, and worth owning.  The featurette newsreel is the real bonus of this disk and offers the only real reason to buy it if you own other Popeye collections.
The quality of the pictures and sound is the usual un-restored sub-par quality found on other Popeye DVDs.  No better or worse than VHS.  It is nice to have the cartoons available at all, and I am happy to own them but it seems like the Sailor Man with the Spinach Can deserves better than the small serving available on this DVD.  I lie in wait of the high-quality box set of Fleischer Popeye cartoons that I would gladly pay big bucks for.  Until then, ""Popeye:  When Popeye Ruled the Seven Seas"" will have to do.",1031788800,15,1280,4.821100917431193
1713775,1,B000067D0M,"First, let's be clear that this review is for this DVD only, and not the cartoons themselves. Among animation fans, few would dispute the fact that the Fleischer brothers were creative geniuses whose innovative techniques are admired to this day.
But the sound on this DVD does these great works a terrible injustice. The sound on Aladdin has been reworked with ""improved"" sound effects, to the detriment of the original dialog and music. I had to shut off surround and turn the treble down to minus 12db on my receiver just to make the added sound bearable! At one point, after Popeye (Aladdin) has been transformed into a prince, he's riding into the city on his great, white steed, and singing a song. But all through the song all I could hear was a loud ""clop, clop, clop"" that was, I presume, supposed to be the sound of horses hooves on pavement, but sounded like nothing less than Monty Python and the Holy Grail's ""banging two coconuts together."" The added or ""enhanced"" sound effects on Aladdin were more than distracting, they were overwhelming!
The rest of the cartoon shorts are a bit better, and the newsreel is an interesting bit of history.
I don't know. All in all I suppose I am happy to have these in some form, but I'd pay several times as much for decently restored (and properly respected) disk of these same cartoons. Hopefully, someone will come along in the not too distant future with a definitive restored collection of the classic Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons and put them on DVD.
This is NOT that DVD. Buy it if you must, but be prepared to tear your hair out all through Aladdin (at least) as you strain to hear the wonderful dialog . . . because it's THAT BAD.",1029196800,5,1695,4.597359735973598

7962502,5,B000067D0M,"this is my first time order this DVD from the Amazon.com and great site to order it.

I'm so huge fan of the Popeye cartoon character and I alway prefer to getting this for the 3 short animated of my favorites with ""Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp"", ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves"" and ""Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor"" with 3 in color version to getting in DVD in my collection. And also plus ""Little Swee' Pea"" and ""Customer Wanted"" in both in B&W version. And also includes bonus about an 5 minute of ""The Making of a Popeye Cartoon"".

7962504,2,B000067D0M,"As many have already pointed out, the cartoons contained in this DVD are the usual sloppy job by cheapskate company Goodtimes Video.  Apparently, the definition of ""digitally remastered"" is quite broad, because these cartoons (especially the color ones) look pretty bad.  All the cartoons here are available in other collections, with varying degrees of quality.  The only good thing about this is the rare newsreel feature that details the making of a Popeye cartoon.  Animation buffs and Popeye fans will appreciate the short feature.  Otherwise, we're still waiting for someone to do the spinach-eatin' sailor justice on DVD.",1164326400,,628,5.36734693877551

7962506,1,B000067D0M,"GoodTimes claims to have ""digitally restored"" these old Popeye cartoons. By ""Digitally Restore,"" they must mean ""add corny sound effects that came with our DVD editing software."" It's bad, folks. If you're a fan of animation history, this DVD will do nothing but make you tear your hair out. My guess is that GoodTimes added the new sound effects so that they could claim copyright on what would otherwise be completely public-domain cartoons. Here's to hoping that someone comes out with a DVD that respects these Fleischer masterpieces.",1141430400,,538,5.125

I have noticed some mixed reviews about this product with most of the negative ones being ghost written by our competition so i wanted to tell everyone the real truth about this product since we are the people who produced it. I am using my wifes Amazon account to post this.

 We have taken some of the greatest classic cartoons ever produced, from some of the greatest animators in history, and meticulously added hundreds of hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars of detailed restoration to both the sound and images in order to make them look as good as they did the day they were first released. Each cartoon is digitally processed first through photo shop frame by frame, and then using both the Davinci and the new Pogo systems to remove every scratch, line, dropout and artifact possible. We then we do a full color restoration at Technicolor using the original color palates to match the colors, tones and shades. We then digitally clean up the sound track to remove all the hiss and scratches and carefully add new foley sound effects, ambience and digitally remix them back onto the cartoons.

The result is our animated DVD series which is currently distributed in both the United States and Canada by Goodtimes Entertainment. These fully restored, full motion, color animations have not been seen in this condition since their original theatrical release. Sit back and be amazed and enjoy some of the finest and funniest animation ever made.

thats why were to only studio doing these that have the blessing and participation of Fleischer Studios and the only one to receive the prestigious Gold Medal from the Classic Animation Preservation Society.

I highly recomend this product to any lovers of classic animation.",1112054400,,1789,4.9072847682119205
7962508,5,B000067D0M,"I loved these when I was a kid - they were on every afternoon during the local kid's show from Ottawa - and seeing them again now, I can understand why I did!  Do they stand the test of time - my three year old is asking for and eating spinach - and singing both Sindbad's song along with Abu Hassan's! (who I think Saddam Hussein based his schitck on - or maybe it was Donald Rumsfeld who used Popeye meets Ali Baba when he planned the invasion using special forces, i.e., Popeye in the run up to the Iraq War.  I digress, but it does have comedic possibilities!)
Yes the sound and transfer are spotty, but I'm sure they were on TV in 1962 too!  Buy it and enjoy!",1089072000,,664,4.092307692307692
