1062361,5,6305732329,"""Outside Providence"" is a surprising movie.  Since it came from the Farrelly brothers, I was expecting little more than the type of humor that was the staple of ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Kingpin"",  and ""There's Something About Mary"".  What I got is a very well  done if not predictable ""coming of age"" story.
The film is set  in 1974 and features Shawn Hatosy as Tim Dunphy, a stoner sent away to a  private school by his single father, played by Alec Baldwin (who calls his  son ""Dildo).  I'm not a fan of Baldwin's but was mightily impressed by  his performance.
At school, Tim finds a new circle of friends (not  abandoning his old ones) and falls for fellow student Jane (Amy Smart).  He  also struggles against an uptight, mean-spirited dorm master.  The comedy  is politically incorrect and sometimes even gross, as you might expect from  a Farrelly brothers film, but the coming of age story gives this movie some  degree of substance that has been lacking in their previous films.  Although the plot is almost painfully predictable, ""Outside  Providence"" succeeds in being interesting and entertaining.
The VHS  version of this film also features an alternate ending.  After seeing it,  I'm glad the brothers stayed with the first.  It resolves all of the  questions that come up in the movie in a much more satisfying way.
One  reviewer described this movie as ""charming"".  I think that says  it right.  Perhaps one of the reasons I think so is that I graduated from  high school at about the same time as Tim and his friends and can really  identify with the struggles they go through.  I consider this to be an  exceptional motion picture (which also includes an exceptional soundtrack  featuring a great collection of songs from that era).",953596800,,1745,4.79054054054054

His father, hoping that someday he'll make something of himself, ships Tim off to a Academy, an upper-crust prep school that promises to straighten  him out.

1062555,5,6305732329,"I owned this movie on VHS I am looking for it on DVD but it's not a barging to buy...just goes to show you it's a great movie still worth buying and I will...
This movie accurately portrays the 1970's like in a small mill city where I actually grew up...neither the internet or cell phones existed back then, life was simple and people socialized in the same fashion as the father did playing cards and drinking and smoking and the kids back then use to get together and smoke a little weed...I actually remember climbing onto giant bill boards and also water towers with friends just hanging out and being kids...we didn't hurt anyone it was just like the movie with an occasional puff of the green to pass time (it was the 1970's).

The acting is spot on...If you grew up in Pawtucket (I did) which is the actual city right next to Providence that this movie is portraying where the character's homes were portrayed, I can totally relate to the movie which made me love it...

I am not a Alex Baldwin fan by any means but he played an excellent role and reminded me of one of my friend's dad I hung out with, so accurate it was like I was reliving my youth, it touched my heart because today my friend and his dad are gone...Maybe that kid of up bringing isn't always going to end up with a happy ending.

Great movie, I won't go into any more details other than to say it was an accurately done movie for it's time period...The kids today couldn't understand because they have been spoiled by technology and so many gadgets to keep them busy they have become drones...Adults today are nothing like the guys playing cards in the movies, they are also drones with limited freedom to speak your mind amongst friends without the fear of offending (cough-cough)...",1421452800,,1762,4.46583850931677

Anyone who grew up in this era would think this was a riot. It gets a bit vulgar, the language is off-color, and there is a lot of marijuana use shown, but that's what makes it so funny. I didn't grown up in that environment, but I laughed almost as hard as they did. We've seen it over and over again. It was a low-budget film, but there is a lot of bang for the buck here. The funniest scene of all, I thought, was when the school's headmaster reads aloud a letter the school received from Dunphy's friend.

Acting was good for what they had to work with, but lacked the true teenage environment of our high schools no matter if private or public.  Alec Baldwin and  Shawn Hatosy the stars did a great job.  They should of read the script better, as it was just not of anytime that was from the 70's to 2013.

For those who do not want reality, this is a movie you might want your children to watch with you during the weekend and they will probably open up more than what this story line did for the audience.

Words like DUNPH are regular in my house.  Of course there are others that may get censored so i'll leave it at that.  If you lived any time at all in the '70s you can relate.  My older brothers practically lived this movie, except for the Cornwall Academy scholarship part.  But they nail it from start to finish.

I had high hopes for this flick, and in truth it had some very good moments, especially in the 'clash of cultures' context.  But the writing was clunky and the transitions were sort of out of nowhere.  It's as though the movie jumped from one scene to another without developing anything or anybody along the way.  Several characters were WAY too stereotypical at the prep school, and were overdone in the decidedly downscale neighborhood where the protagonist comes from. But I could overlook that.  The jumping from scene to scene, the lack of coherence, the obvious need of the director to shove the social distances and divisions in our face got real old and took a lot away from good performances.",1337472000,,771,4.7593984962406015

The movie is great. Anyone that likes movies about a small town with high school age kids having fun and getting into trouble (""coming of age"") will like this movie. Its not silly with dumbasses doing stupid things. It's actually rather serious toned with funny things that happen to the people. Alec Baldwin is GREAT in this movie!!! I think this is my favorite character of his. (I liked him in Along Came Polly, too) Amy Smart is always hot and she plays the girl next door the best! I don't want to give the plot away, but its a great story... kind of a slow moving one, but fun. Basically a typical under-educated high school boy who typically causes his share of trouble, gets sent to a private school. He meets some friends and a girl. That's about all you need to know.

Based on a book that was written by one of them, and based on their childhood experiences.. I think that this was less of a ""gross-out"" comedy, and more of a down-home, touch your heart sort of experience.

""My fathers name for me was Dildo.""

This movie, for one thing, established Alec Baldwin, in my head as a great comedic and character actor. His role as the single father, raising two children (both mad pot head deliquents) always makes me laugh. The view of Providence, RI circa the 1970's is great, and full of awesome rock and roll.

This movie has plenty of hillarious moments, but also has a few good moments that may just learn ya a thing or two...

for instance... you should always savor a good woman, the way you would savor a good smoke... and that masturbation is nothing to be ashamed of. And also a great lesson on how to balance keeping your idiot friends and keeping your responsibilities in order.  Anyway, great cast all around, good story, lotta fun...

There, he tangles with strict administrators, suffers the classrooms of  exacting instructors, and hangs out with fellow pothead students. He also encounters Jane Weston, hands down the coolest chick in school and from an upper class family. Jane is beautiful but studious; she's trying to get accepted to Brown University. Dunph is just trying to get by without accruing any more punishment for violation of school policies. Regarding Jane, his friend advises Dunph: ""Forget it."" Yet, somehow, Dunph and Jane get together. It's not a match made in heaven, but hey, Dunph will take it...

Supposedly based on Peter Farrelly's school experiences at Kent, Outside Providence is a very good coming-of-age movie. It was touted as a comedy but, really, while it has its share of laugh-out-loud funnies, its dramatic undercurrent is the engine that drives it home beautifully. It reminds me of those 1980s John Hughes dramedies (Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful). Yes, this movie is liberally dosed with pot jokes, but a sense of realness and pathos felt  throughout provides a nice counterbalance. From a raucous Farrelly Brothers-type comedy to an ultimately thoughtful film. Very nice.

The only other time I've seen Shawn Hatosy was in the cool horror The Faculty; to be honest, in that film, he didn't make much of an impression on me. But, here, he takes center stage and does a real good job in portraying easy-going, pot-smoking Dunph, who initially is aimless and just drifting along but then undergoes life lessons and steps up to responsibility. Amy Smart's Jane is a major impetus in Dunph's maturation process. Amy plays her character as a young woman who's smart and hardworking - but not afraid to let her hair down - and, most importantly, she is genuine; those qualities, more often than not, are enough to positively influence a guy. The supporting cast, from Pawtucket, Rhode Island to Cornwall, Connecticut, does a credible job evoking the '70s, ably backed by the great soundtrack. Alec Baldwin is remarkably good in playing Dunph's gruff, hard-bitten father, with surprising hidden depths. On the other hand, Timothy Crowe as Mr. Funderberk seems to be channeling Jeffrey Jones's Principal Ed Rooney (Ferris Bueller's Day Off).

I knew this movie was gonna make me smile and laugh; I was surprised when it made me feel. Outside Providence is very recommended.",1151452800,7,2563,5.078384798099762
1062918,5,6305732329,"Although very humorous, ""Outside Providence"" is a departure from other Farrely brothers movies like ""Kingpin"" and ""There's Something About Mary."" This is a more intelligent, less vulgar offering which still delivers the laughs.

Set in the 70's, the film is a moving coming of age tale about a middle class pothead shipped off to a prep school after a run-in with the law.

Predicable hijinks ensue as ""Dumph"" (played by Sean Hatosy) faces a difficult adjustment to his new world. The strength of the film is in the relationship between ""Dumph"" and his father (played by Alec Baldwin). Baldwin is totally convincing as ""Old Man Dumphy"", a gruff but caring father heartbroken by the loss of his wife.

If you grew up in the 70's, you'll probably enjoy this nostaglic look at teenage life set to a fantastic soundtrack of 70's hits.",1146268800,4,830,4.830985915492958

1062977,3,6305732329,"Outside Providence is a slight but charming coming-of-age movie set in the 1970s. It is the type of picture which makes the film festival circuit and is lucky if it finds a distributor. It received venomous reviews from critics, but much of what they wrote seemed to be about the picture's producer, Peter Farrelly. This guy, along with his brother, wrote and directed both Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary. The siblings are also behind this summer's Jim Carrey release, Me, Myself and Irene. Mr. Farley also penned the novel on which Outside Providence is based. Many of these critics seemed convinced that Farrelly used his power to muscle Miramax Films into making the movie. Well, so what? Welcome to Hollywood, boys and girls.
Timothy Dumphy [Shawn Hatosy] is a likable working-class kid. He lives in a run down house in Pawtucket, Rhode Island with his Dad, his wheelchair bound younger brother [cool kid!] and a three-legged mutt. He loves to hang out with his long-haired buddies, who while away the summer nights smoking pot. One night, the car they are riding in gets so smoke filled that the driver rear ends a parked police car. Dad has an influential friend who saves Timothy from jail by somehow getting him into a private boarding school in Connecticut, where Timothy and his new friends while away the fall nights smoking pot. He soon meets a rich girl from Virginia, and they spend their afternoons in the woods smoking pot. The villain in the movie is a prissy teacher who loves to bust the kids and put them on work detail. As soon as his back is turned, they usually run and hide and smoke you know what. I think I got a contact high about halfway through Outside Providence.
What impressed me was that, given a plot that is more a series of vignettes than a story, director Michael Corrente was able to do anything at all with the movie. Nothing much happens. The dramatic high point occurs when Jane [Amy Smart], the girlfriend, convinces Timothy that he might rise above a 'D' grade average if he quits getting stoned while he studies.
Most of the movie's scenes are basically skits. Some work, and some don't. This structure weakens the film, because, by its nature, it makes it inconsistent. When the skits work, they are very funny. The ones that don't aren't so much boring as they are flat.
Don't get the wrong impression from all the drug use. All of these kids are basically sweet-natured and kind. So are all but one of the adults. In this version of the 70s, beer and weed are just part of growing up. There is not one teenaged character here who does not indulge. I suspect that this is how Peter Farrelly, who was born in 1957, remembers growing up. Considering how delightfully deranged his movies are today, this may be autobiographical material.[....]Is it possible that what offended critics so much, besides who produced Outside Providence, was the fact that these kids indulge in behavior that would get you twenty to life in our uptight times? Did they ever stop to consider that the movie is a parody of life in the 70s? Are we so ramrod straight now that we don't know a comedy when we see one, if said comedy is politically incorrect? My point is that, while this movie is hardly great cinema, it still is a small but often warm bit of entertainment. Lighten up!",1016582400,3,3322,4.651360544217687
1062978,3,6305732329,"If you're looking for R-rated terms of endearment, _Outside Providence_ can suggest several. Most of these affectionate references are lobbed by Alec Baldwin's character, a working class father whose eldest son, Tim, is giving him a hard time. The worst of Tim's hijinks involve booze, pot, and an unfortunate fender bender with a cop car--this accident proves a sufficient reason to send Tim to upper-crust Cornwall Prep School, a place that your average blue collar kid is bound to feel out of place.

I was nervous at the idea of seeing another movie hero come of age, especially considering that one of the Farrelly brothers penned the original novel and contributed to the screenplay. Have no fear; _Outside Providence_ is subtly acted, riotously funny, painfully uncomfortable, but mostly satisfying. A friend who accompanied me said, ""I am happy with that whole movie""--a rare sentiment from that particular critic!",1010534400,2,922,5.22972972972973
1062979,3,6305732329,"The ambiguity of youth and the road to maturity are addressed in a somewhat stoically humorous manner by the Farrelly Brothers in the comedy, ""Outside Providence,"" directed by Michael Corrente.  Set in New England in 1974, the story centers on Tim Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy), an irresponsible seventeen-year-old who since the untimely death of his mother has lived with his gruff, blue-collar father (Alec Baldwin), his crippled younger brother, Jackie (Tommy Bone) and a one-eyed, three-legged dog.  Life is less than idyllic for Tim, but it doesn't seem to make much difference as long as he can live in the moment and get high with his friends.  In that respect, in fact, life is pretty good.  Tim's a senior in high school with nary a care in the world, until a car accident involving drugs and alcohol lands him in big trouble, and he avoids incarceration only by the grace and intervention of one of his father's ""connected"" cronies.  Instead of jail time he is sent away to the prestigious prep school, Cornhill, whereupon graduation his offense will be expunged from his record.  All he has to do is toe the line and get through his senior year.  But that senior year can last a long time, especially after he meets Jane Weston (Amy Smart), the girl of his (and everybody else's) dreams.  So what is a lad to do, knuckle down, follow the rules and put his life in order-- or follow his heart?  Or, as Tim replies when a teacher asks him to name his favorite author, ""Hamlet.""  To be, or not to be.  And that is the question.
 While not terribly original by any means, Corrente's film (which he co-wrote with Bobby and Peter Farrelly, adapted from the novel by Peter Farrelly) is funny and well presented, and has that quirky, recognizable Farrelly Brother's touch.  There's even a poignant moment or two, and most importantly, this isn't a ""silly"" movie, and though the characters are fairly stereotypical, Corrente manages to give it something of a fresh face and allows the humor to evolve naturally, never fishing for laughs or manipulating the situations purely for the sake of hilarity.  And it works well; there are some genuinely funny scenes, some side-splitting lines and one signature Farrelly Brothers scene that involves a flashback of the traumatic ""hazing"" of a freshman named Irving (Jack Ferver).
 Shawn Hatosy gives a believable performance as Tim, and though he's not overly charismatic or likable, he does create a character with whom many peers and parents will be able to relate.  Tim is a very real person feeling his way through a very precarious period of his life.  And beyond the humorous aspects of the film, there is actually some very credible character development evident in Tim's behavior, and in the final analysis the overall picture not only aspires to a higher level because of it, but succeeds in that regard.  Hatosy's Tim is very much the average kid who lives in your neighborhood and works at the local fast food joint while he figuring out what life is all about.  Without anything singular or remarkable about him, he is entirely true-to-life and honest.
 As ""Old Man Dunphy,"" Baldwin gives a solid performance, and with limited screen time manages to establish his character with astute precision.  Like Tim, Baldwin's character is real, and serves as a kind of core for the story, and that realism of the characters is one of the strengths of the film.  The ""Old Man"" maintains a gruff exterior-- a bravura by which to live, if you will-- but you get a sense that there is something deeper to him, while at the same time you realize that what you see is very much a true perspective of who he really is as well.  It's a matter of Baldwin's ability as an actor enabling him to infuse some complexity into a character that could easily have been one dimensional in less capable hands.
 The supporting cast includes Jon Abrahams (Drugs Delaney), Richard Jenkins (Barney), George Wendt (Joey), Adam LaVorgna (Tommy the Wire), Timothy Crowe (Mr. Funderbeck), George Martin (Dean Mort), Gabriel Mann (Jack) and Kristen Shorten (Bunny Cote).  In a market veritably saturated for some time with comedies about teen angst (most of which are silly, insignificant, devoid of real humor and not worth the film they're printed on), with ""Outside Providence,"" Corrente and the Farrelly Brothers have to be given credit for delivering one that is truly funny while at the same time anchored in reality.  There is, in fact, more here than meets the eye upon the initial viewing.  Not only does it capture the essence of the era in which it takes place, but a sense of reality that in the end is definitive of it, as well.  And it's done with humor, and without taking it over the edge, as the Farrelly Brothers are often won't to do.  Ultimately, it's a satisfying experience, and it's the magic of the movies.",1000512000,3,4842,4.779111644657863

My Opinion:  I was very surprised with this movie. It is pushed very strongly as a comedy. Probably because the Farrelly Brothers are famous for those. Although it has funny parts, I don't consider it a comedy. It is more of a coming of age film. It takes place in the 1970s and has a killer soundtrack.

Shawn Hatosy stars as Timothy Dunphy, a likable, not-very-bright  high school student who, like many of his generation, would much rather  party than study and would rather smoke-out than think seriously about his  future plans for college or career or even life in general.  When he  crashes his vehicle, packed with other drinking and pot-smoking teenagers,  right smack into the rear of a parked police car, Tim is sent by his  working class father to finish his last school year at a nearby prep  academy.  Alec Baldwin, adopting a dese-dem-dose accent for the occasion,  plays Tim's father, a well-intentioned widower whose brusque demeanor hides  a filial love that Tim is only vaguely aware exists.
""Outside Providence""  certainly does not bring a whole lot of fresh insights to this well-worn  territory.  We have the obligatory scenes of non-stop pot smoking (this  being a depiction of 1970's adolescence after all), the inevitable first  love between the hero and the sweetest, most understanding and, of course,  most beautiful girl from the local distaff school, and the predictable  confrontations that develop between the freethinking teen and the  anachronistic stuffed shirts of the school's administration.  There is  also, of course, the mandatory death of one of the members of the original  gang to act as a device to sober the boy's up to an awakened awareness of  the seriousness and responsibilities of adulthood.
Yet, for all of its  adherence to the formula of this particular genre, ""Outside Providence""  wins the audience over, partly through the breezy likeability of the actors  and performers, partly through the unforced realism of the screenplay, and  partly through the film's dead-on accurate recreation of a decade that is  fast becoming the era of choice for modern day nostalgia.  Like so many  films that tie themselves strongly to a time long past, ""Outside  Providence"" relies (and perhaps even over relies) on a soundtrack filled  with memory-inducing tunes of the period.  This is the easiest trick in the  book for filmmakers to stir an audience's fond recollections - but, damned  if it doesn't work every time.  In addition, the film is set within the  beautiful environs of autumnal New England, a factor that contributes to  the overall laid-back charm of the film.
""Outside Providence"" provides a  relaxing, unfrenetic trip down memory lane for those of us who happen to  have come of age in the era the Farrellys are presenting.  The film  ultimately doesn't amount to much, but one could find worse ways to spend  90 minutes - and a worse group of people with which to spend it.",968025600,4,2931,5.110169491525424

Although billed as a comedy, as you would expect any movie to be that's tied to the Dumb & Dumber Farrley Bros.,it's far  from any slapstick that you've seen from them before. Instead, it mixes  drama such as father/son relationships and homosexuality with a 3 legged  dog and a handicapped child who gets pulled by a car in order to deliver  the newspaper. Normally, I would applaud a departure such as this if it  wasn't for the terrible direction, lack of solid plotting, and mediocre  acting, even from one of my favorites, Alec Baldwin. You're never sure if  this is a comedy, drama,or what...The site gags fall flat in the face of  the drama, the story lags, and the plot has holes you could drive a john  deere thru!

It makes no sense! And  where did the girlfriend come from, out of the blue? Suddenly there's a  girl's school close by?And how is George Wendt, who plays the homosexual,  back into the weekly poker game after being thrown out the week before? And  this is based on a book? All I can figure is that the Farrleys were to  stoned when they wrote the book and made the movie to remember the segues  that lead to the answers to all of these questions. And as a result, that's  how the entire movie comes across; dazed and confused!",959731200,,1540,4.400709219858156
1063062,5,6305732329,"Tim Dunphey is on the road to nowhere. He spends his time skipping school, smoking dope with some heavy drug using friends and literally heading nowhere.
He lives with his dad (Alec Baldwin) and a handicapped brother.  Mom passed away years ago but Dad doesn't speak about the  circumstances.
Tim finally gets in enough trouble for Dad to decide he  needs to get him out of the environment around Pawtucket, Rhode Island  where they live. He send him to Cornwall Academy, a college prep school in  Connecticut.
At first, Tim goes on as he had in Rhode Island, doping,  not cooperating, stacking up detentions and simply not taking his new  school seriously.
Tim meets a girl who changes all that. He falls in love  with her head over heals and will do anything to please her -- including  study. Tim's grades begin to improve dramatically and we see a gradual  softening of this nice kid who thought he was a total tough ass.
Shawn  Hatosy does an excellent job of portrarying Tim. We see a shy, sensitive,  lonely kids who falls in with a bunch of druggies. Yet, even though they  are his main friends, we get a sense he's really not comfortable with them.  He really cares for his younger brother and tries to spend as much time  with him as possible.
Getting in trouble turns out to be a good thing for  Tim. At the end, we have a kid who seems to have his head on straight. He's  headed for Junior College and realizes the druggie life is a trip to  nowhere.
Alec Baldwin does an excellent job portraying Tim's Dad. The  struggles of raising him alone are apparent. Baldwin reveals to Tim a very  touching and sad story of how his Mom committed suicide. The story is as  tough for Baldwin to finally share as it is for Tim to hear.
This is a  wonderful story. It's isn't big budget, it doesn't have all kinds of  exciting props and action. It deals with the reality of everyday life and  growing up. It's a tribute to the writers that they chose this story after  big event pictures like Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber. Sadly  because this wasn't a full adreneline film, it got short shift at the box  office. Well worth seeing on video!",959385600,5,2151,4.4627249357326475
1063063,4,6305732329,Great film that was severly overlooked with the current glutch of teen films.baldwin as never been better and Hatosy shows how wasted he was in The Faculty by brandishing the screen with a performance only mirrored in  todays teenage world by the also great Sexton jnr 111. The dialogue  sparkles with farrelly freshness & the eye to detail (of the 70S) is  second to none. Teens of today don't worry YOU WILL like this film although  you didn't know the 70S. just sit back and prepare to laugh and be moved all  in one. a great great film sadly discarded in todays 'want the next thing'  society...oh and the soundtrack ROCKS!,958780800,,627,4.603603603603603

1063065,5,6305732329,"Tender, funny, real comedy/drama from the Farrelly Brothers. A surprise for nonfans of the brothers and another great movie from the masters of comedy writing. Great script from a very good book from Peter Farrelly.  Michael Corrente's direction is solid. Great performances by Alec Baldwin  and Amy Smart. Best acting though is by newcomer Mike Cerrone who plays  cardplayer Cavveech. He steals the scenes he's in (playing cards) and has  the funniest lines in the movie. He belongs in the cast of The Sopranos.  Also excellent is Sean Gildea (a staple in Farrelly films)as the trendy  teacher. Everyone I know has enjoyed this movie. That is what the  Farrelly's know how to do. Write a funny, down to earth, memorable and most  of all, enjoyable movie.",958521600,,755,4.936507936507937
1063066,5,6305732329,"Simply put, this is a wonderful film. The story is not original but this is not meant as a criticism, since very few stories are anymore. What sets this movie apart is the the way in which all of the characters are thought  out and portrayed and the skill of actors involved. The physical comedy is  well done, but not cartoonish, like in There's Something About Mary and  Dumb and Dumber (the film makers better known productions).
Alec Baldwin  gives his role the kind of depth unusual in modern popular culture where  father figures are ridiculed and dismissed as stupid, cruel, or  dysfunctional. The scenes where Baldwin's character teaches his son how to  put on a tie properly, and his confrontation over his wife's suicide are  unexpected, genuine, brilliant, and moving.
 This could have been a  buffoonish movie that turned on humor frequently drawn from teen cruelty  and immaturity. What we have, instead, is a film that plays on all of the  comic potential of drugs, disco, the 1970s, and Pawtucket, Rhode Island;  but it is also about friendship, loyalty, respect for women, making  mistakes, and doing the right thing to make up for them. I suspect that  most people who rent this will come looking for something between  ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Porky's.""  They  will be disappointed because they miscalculated. Anyone looking for  something more will be glad that they picked up ""Outside  Providence.""",956793600,2,1429,4.97457627118644

1063068,4,6305732329,"Though I was expecting more of the ""Something About Mary"" humor, I still found this movie enjoyable. With some adolescent humor mixed with a ""Dead Poet's Society"" hint (the setting, the prep school, etc.),  I found myself engaged in the main characters.  To me, ""Outside  Providence"" was the equivalent of a good beach book -- don't expect  too much depth, just sit back, ride the tides, and laugh a little while  you're doing it.",956620800,,430,4.756756756756757
1063069,3,6305732329,"This mid 70's slice of life comedy is charming in spots, but mostly insubstantial. It is the story of a working class teenager from Rhode Island named Timothy Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy) who is sent to prep school for  getting into trouble with the police. The story meanders through his  exploits with his friends at home, his relationship with his father (Alec  Baldwin), and his situations with his new preppy friends and with the evil  headmaster. The film has its moments, but mostly it is a nostalgic  retrospective on prep life in the 1970's with little in the way of a  plot.
Having gone to college in Rhode Island in the 1970's, I can  identify with the period, and Rhode Islande born director Michael Corrente,  through the look and feel of the New England settings and the background  music, did a good job of bringing back a flood of memories from that  time.
Shawn Hatosy did an excellent job in his portrayal of a working  class teen, trying to make the best of what he considered a bad situation.  His acting, though not yet very polished, is very sincere and this part  seemed to fit his personality well. Amy Smart, as his girlfriend Jane, is a  fresh face with a sweet look; just perfect for the nice girl role. Smart  also exuded sincerity so the screen chemistry between the two was  excellent.
Alec Baldwin finally found a role where his new paunchy look  was an asset. Actually, he was quite good as Timothy's rather crude dad,  doing the best he could with limited intellectual assets. Baldwin, who  usually plays clever characters, gave a realistic and enjoyable performance  of a working class stiff, though his accent was a little too stereotypical  and not true to Rhode Island.
I gave this film a 6/10. It relied too  heavily on New England charm and there was just not enough story. Though  there were funny scenes sprinkled here and there and the ending was nice,  it just lacked the horsepower to really keep the viewer engaged throughout.",956016000,,1964,4.675438596491228
1063070,4,6305732329,"From the minds behind ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Theres Something About Mary"" comes another raunchy landmark comedy, but one with heart.
Seemingly repetitive, a teenage boy is sent to a prep school  after a car accident involving a parked police car, several friends, and  unspecified amounts of narcotics. Throughout his journey he encounters  friends, foes, and of course, love.
The same coming of age tale every  weekly movie aims for, however superior to most thanks to several key  factors.
Alec Baldwin, who was perhaps cast merely to attach a well  known name to the movie, pulls off a surprisingly tricky role as a rock  solid father who is confused and disappointed with his life. One of the  movies most effective scenes is a short one, involving this star-stunned  actor teaching his son how to knot a tie.
The script is not only amusing,  but it also provides a lot of emotional depth to the story through simple  and idealistic lines. Written with cunning craft and executed superbly by  the cast, it provides a solid backbone for the movie and proves to be  effective in conveying the situations.
What truly brings this movie  together, though, is the charming charisma of newcomer Shawn Hatosy.  Capturing the naive facial gestures, the sorrow- filled-eyes maneuvers, and  that age old enlightmened maturity posture seems to be a natural gift to  this young actor.
Along with those three factors, it is wise to note the  crude and yet witty comedy often present in the Farrely Brothers works:  obsessing with homosexuality, mocking social status, and the maniacal  humiliation that comes with life. For some this genre of entertainment is  not appealing, however I found their classic formula highly  engrossing.
It is hard to say what the downside of this movie is, except  that the ending left me somewhat unsatisfied. Perhaps thats merely because  I was enjoying the film so much I simply did not want to end. Of course,  given the flow of the movie, the ending was a natural and propable choice.
An all around impressive film from those fiendishly humorous brothers,  ""Outside Providence"" is a landmark of their work.",954028800,15,2132,4.951977401129944
