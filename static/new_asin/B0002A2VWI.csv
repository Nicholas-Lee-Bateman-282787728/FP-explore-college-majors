2073085,3,B0002A2VWI,The story was supposedly mostly true. It certainly shows what women had to put up with from their fathers when they wanted to date someone he didn't approve of. I would recommend it. The technology of it on the kindle was very bad though. I had to try to watch it at different times. It would skip and freeze all the time.,1375056000,,322,4.209677419354839
2073086,4,B0002A2VWI,"Horton Foote's Courtship is a quiet but compelling film.  It won't be to everyone's taste, but it is one of those rare films that engages with the lives people actually live.  Fundamental human issues and problems are given voice through the lives of ordinary folks in a pre-world war one Texas town.",1359417600,2,300,4.75
2073087,3,B0002A2VWI,"I  realize my review is  not a  glowing one but I found this movie's pace to be too  slow.  On the other hand,  I found the acting to be quite competent.  Too bad the pace of the story and some of the dialogue was stultifying.",1347321600,,226,3.888888888888889
2073088,5,B0002A2VWI,"Horton Foote knows how to tell a story. The time is 1915, when the Vaughn family spends one day trying to maintain a way of life that is fast coming to an end.  Daughters Elizabeth and Laura struggle as they long for independence while they are under the thumb of a dominating father.

The girls have practiced a deception that is, of course, found out and they suffer but Elizabeth becomes determined to follow her heart.

The cast is really spot on with three of Foote's children taking roles.  Daughter Hallie as Elizabeth, Horton Foote, jr as Steve and another daughter in a very minor role.  Amanda Plummer is Laura.  The parents and two aunts round out a cast that make you think you are back in an era where young ladies were totally ignorant of the facts of life and the older generation frets as they see that their children are growing up.",1331769600,5,849,4.48051948051948
2073089,5,B0002A2VWI,"I became interested in purchasing this because I discovered that it was a prequel to a Horton Foote story that I owned on VHS, ""1918"". This story is about the same family, but set a few years earlier. I also purchased ""On Valentine's Day"" which is a story that falls between this one and ""1918"".",1259539200,2,295,4.381818181818182
2073090,5,B0002A2VWI,"One of Horton Foote's best stories, beautifully adapted to the screen. A very gentle movie reminding one of what life used to be.",1231200000,2,129,4.6521739130434785
2073091,5,B0002A2VWI,"In the events of one summer evening, a young woman comes to a decision that will change her life. During the course of this wonderful play by Horton Foote, we get a glimpse of a solid middle class family in a small Texas town. The year is 1915 and Victorian mores rule as a patriarchal father attempts to rein in the emotional yearnings of his daughter, who has fallen in love with a young man he does not approve of. Ever polite and respectful, her face a mask of composure, she reveals in long conversations with her sister and the young man courting her the inclinations of her heart and the uncertainty she experiences in judging whether the heart should guide one's most important choices and actions. Meanwhile, dance music floats in on the evening air, belying the turmoil of small-town melodrama that swirls around them in gossip about others, past and present, for whom affairs of the heart have gone awry or fully wrong.

Foote's play has been brought lovingly and faithfully to the screen. The long dialogues and monologues are magical in how they reflect the inner conflicts, the emotional negotiations made and unmade, and especially the graceful awkwardness of the two young lovers as they gently reveal their affection for each other on the front porch of her house, very much aware of the displeased father who roams the rooms inside. Like Foote's other plays, this one is for lovers of the spoken word and the theatre. I certainly loved every minute of it.",1214352000,30,1473,4.7315175097276265
2073092,5,B0002A2VWI,"Horton Foote is a playwright and screenwriter of the gentlest, most powerful kind.  His beginnings in small town Texas has informed most all of his writing ever since.  He has written for broadway, live television and hollywood.  He wrote the amazing screenplay for ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" based on Harper Lee's book.  He wrote the films ""Tender Mercies"" and ""Trip to Bountiful"" (based on his play)  He's won the Pultzer Prize for his play ""Young Man From Atlanta"" (1995).  Many of his plays have ended up on video/dvd and ""Courtship"" is one of them.  It was first shown on PBS.

There is a series of plays written by Mr. Foote called ""The Orphan's Home Cycle"".  Nine terrific plays, gentle and rewarding individually...put them together and you have a gorgeous epic that spans decades.  The plays follow a boy named Horace from childhood to adulthood.

The middle three plays of this cycle are: ""Courtship"", ""Valentine's Day"" and ""1918"" and are all on DVD and available on Amazon.

""Courtship"" takes place in Texas of 1915 and tells the story of Horace as he courts Elizabeth. (Played beautifully by Horton's daughter).  As we hear Elizabeth and her sister (played by the wonderfully quirky Amanda Plummer) talk of what's happening in the town around them and the old fashioned patriarchal presence of their parents overshadow the proceedings, it becomes difficult for Elizabeth to make a decision that will please her parents, her sister, Horace and herself.  The delicate way the subjects of love, danger, security and family roam in and out of the dialouge is very moving.  ""Courtship"" stands alone as an amazing timepiece.  Put the film together with the next chapter, ""On Valentine's Day"" and then with ""1918"" and you have an amazing statement of life in small town America from 1915 to World War I. You have a dramatic poem about love and endurance.  You also have an important document of Amercan theater by having a record of this great playwright's work come to life.

The same wonderful cast is in all three films, offering great continuity of performance and sparse, tender storytelling.

2073099,5,B0002A2VWI,"This is one of the best videos I own.  I remember watching it originally on American Playhouse on PBS back in the mid 1980's when they were first produced.  American Playhouse ran them as Story of a Marriage.  I'm talking about Courtship, On Valentine's Day, and 1918, in case anyone is not familiar with all three.  Horton Foote is brilliant at capturing the manners and ways of the Old South.  The characters and dialog are spot-on.  These people behave exactly as people of their status behaved 100 years ago in the Old South, down to the last word.  Those of us who come from that background recognize it as a true portrayal of life in a small southern town.

Some of the people who don't like it say it is not their kind of movie, which I can understand.  Some people only like movies with a lot of action, instead of meaningful dialog, which is a personal preference, much the same as liking or not liking science fiction movies.  But for the others, I honestly think it went over their heads and they simply were not able to understand the subtlety of a movie like this one.",1451520000,3,1081,4.441624365482234

2073109,5,B0002A2VWI,I have always enjoyed Horton Foote's plays and found this telling of his parent's courtship most interesting.  A good insight into the life of small town Texas.,1428364800,,160,4.925925925925926

2073111,1,B0002A2VWI,"Seriously don't understand why anyone would like this. NOTHING happens. In a movie called Courtship I would expect that the main characters might go out on a date or something....crazy me. They don't . The ENTIRE play takes place on the porch of a house with a few blips into a dance going on down the street. Now I am no expert on Texas living during this time frame, but I would not expect two very educated women to talk like hillbillies from the deep south. The dialog is VERY unnatural and juvenile. I guess this is an attempt at recreating the level of polite obvious conversation that was common among the wealthy households such as the ""How is your mother""....""She is well""...""Thank you for your kind inquiry"" kind of thing, but this is definitely no Sense and Sensibility. Don't waste your time.",1425772800,4,804,4.629370629370629

Written by Horton Foote, who I never realized wrote the screenplay for one of my all time favorite movies, The Trip To Bountiful. He really develops unforgettable characters. With my hearing a little goofy lately, I was disappointed that 1918 didn't have closed captioning, while the two earlier ones did. I will eventually watch these, again.
