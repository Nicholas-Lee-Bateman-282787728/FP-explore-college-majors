8121892,3,B000FFJ8SA,Overpriced for a 2006 movie....,1409011200,,31,5.4
8121893,4,B000FFJ8SA,"So I liked the movie.  All the characters seemed very believable. After seeing a few similar movies, you would avoid gambling altogether.  Casinos are run by THUGS! They will beat the crap out of winners who are OBSERVANT!",1403913600,,222,4.815789473684211
8121894,5,B000FFJ8SA,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Very well acted, good plot line, simple but not silly. It delves into how easily gambeling can become an obsession and the consequences that result. Fine young cast along with veteran character actor Charles Martin Smith make this a great ensamble movie. Katharine Isabelle is her usual standout and might I add beautiful actress in her role as a graduate student trying to make enough money to finish her degree.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a simple, well acted, ensabmle movie. If you are a Katharine Isabelle fan, this one is a must.",1235779200,,619,4.585585585585585
8121895,4,B000FFJ8SA,"I wanted to see this movie because it had Katherine Isabelle in it from the Ginger Snaps trilogy.  I think Katherine and Emily Perkins did such a wonderful job in those movies.  So, after watching this movie I had to buy it.  The characters are all played out very well and there is humor and a little bit of action and suspense in it.  You may come to the same conclusion after watching this, like I did.  But I think this is the basis for the movie 21, that just recently came out.  What do you think?",1224892800,,503,4.134020618556701
8121896,5,B000FFJ8SA,The Best canadian movie ever and i got the movie in 2 business days!!! Impressive.,1213833600,,82,4.533333333333333
8121897,4,B000FFJ8SA,"OK....I'm partial to Katharine Isabelle.  This movie is very entertaining, however, and is a great treat for Katharine Isabelle fans.  Lots of great humor and some really good drama as well.  One of my favorite scenes is in a restaurant where KI's character is forced to repeat a very tongue twisting and confusing pizza order.  It's also nice to watch Katharine stand up to a casino owner who suspects her (rightfully)of counting cards.  There is also a nice ""moral"" lesson here concerning gambling addictions and the consequences thereof.  It was definitely worth my time.  I've watched this movie more than once and have enjoyed it just as much the 2nd and 3rd time around!",1200528000,,676,4.87719298245614
8121898,5,B000FFJ8SA,"I was really impressed with this movie. It was exciting, suspenseful, somewhat believable, and really fun. Way better than I would expect a made-for-TV movie to be. I've already watched it twice, and plan to again soon when I have someone else who's interested. *Excellent* ending.",1181606400,,281,5.130434782608695
