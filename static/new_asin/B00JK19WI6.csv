8651631,2,B00JK19WI6,This DVD is only 59 minutes!!!!!!! There is one story on this DVD and it isn't that compelling. The program starts with a women lying dead on the bed with her sister barricaded in the bathroom. The two main characters who are accused of this crime then speak into the camera about what happened. Of course they both accuse each other of  killing the dead women. There is a solicitor for the women but not one for the man which I found  unfair.  The solicitor keeps saying sisters don't kill sisters and therefore the women didn't kill her sister. The evidence that was presented wasn't  very compelling in making the case that the women didn't kill her sister. There was a tape of this women punching her sister in the head earlier in the evening. Of course the women got off and the man went to prison for the crime. You could compare this program to a B movie. There is just something lost in this type of series where almost all the action takes place with the characters talking into the camera. It's like a sandwich without the spread inside. It might have worked if the DVD was at least and hour longer and there were two solicitors presenting the cases in more depth so you could figure out who really killed the dead women.,1435536000,,1231,4.433628318584071
