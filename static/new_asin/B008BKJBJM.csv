8526635,5,B008BKJBJM,"This was an excellent Dvd because you truly get to for the price of one for Ol' Webhead. I love the Spactacular Spidey series cause its modern and hip. And the short lived cgi Spiderman show was pretty cool to. You may have to get used to the art, but good spidey/peter stories. A solid combo deal.",1407283200,,298,4.245614035087719
