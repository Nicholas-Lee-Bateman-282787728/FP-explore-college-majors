8185799,5,B000OONQ8A,Really enjoyed this movie. Reccommend it. A big fan of Haley Duff. Always enjoy whatever she stars in. She always gives her best.,1389312000,,129,4.6521739130434785
8185800,2,B000OONQ8A,This is your typical skateboarding movie that was clearly produced and shot by people who do not skateboard.  Just like every other Hollywood skate movie,1358553600,,153,5.12
8185801,5,B000OONQ8A,"this movie is excellent cinematography. and artists and a lot of very misunderstood outstanding performers. only if you are retarded or incult or illiterate will you dislike this pellicle. it has the best scenario, the best directing and the best music and the best actors.",1275523200,,273,5.088888888888889
8185802,5,B000OONQ8A,"Well, going into this movie I really didn't know what to think considering that I don't like skateboarding in any way. By the time this movie was over I was in love with it. I don't know if it was because my favorite actress was in it, Haylie Duff, or what. But its a great film...even if your not a skateboarding person!",1275264000,,321,4.193548387096774
8185803,5,B000OONQ8A,"When Kevin (Marshall Allman) looks for a way to escape his back-breaking summer job, he enlists in the kitchen at an extreme summer camp with the hopes of spending his breaks on the half-pipe. But Kevin gets more than he bargained for when he teams up with his fellow extreme skateboarder dishwashers, The Dishdogz. He'll have to be more radical than the competition and win the heart of the girl (Haylie Duff) if he's going to keep up with his new crew. But before he does, he'll have to get all his work done, if he's to avoid a thrashing from his surly boss Tony (Luke Perry), who's hiding a secret that's truly old school. In the end he learns the true meaning of skateboarding and how to never give up.",1275004800,,707,4.404580152671755
8185804,5,B000OONQ8A,"The Movie Gallery here only had one copy of the DVD. I would have thought that kind of movie would have a lot of appeal to the younger audiences of skateboarders. Come one guys!

We all really liked DishDogz because it did not have cursing or killing or anything like that. Michelle Lombardo (she was the swimsuit model in the film) was easy on the eyes to say the least.

Haylie Duff plays a really sweet girl. She does a really good job here with this part. She also plays in Backwoods, Legacy, Material Girls, and more! :)

Luke Perry must not be used to being the ""old guy"" in a movie but he did it well. Laid back and cool without being out of it.

Marshall Allman did a really good job as the outsider trying to fit in. I specially liked Tim DePriest as Malone. Every movie needs a guy full of himself that gets his at the end. Without a bad guy, you cannot have a good guy. Tim played the part well as a skateboard snob who is so impressed with himself that he cannot be charming and so we do not feel bad for what happens to him.

I think everyone will like the Dish Dogz. They pull pranks on each other without being mean. Way to go guys! And the camp counselor was just perfect for the part. Haven't you seen guys like that? Well done!

The camera work on the stunts was great! The location was awesome!

It is a predictable movie but still very enjoyable!",1273881600,,1366,4.171102661596958
