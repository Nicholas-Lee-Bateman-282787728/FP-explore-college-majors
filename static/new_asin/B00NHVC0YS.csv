6656882,5,B00NHVC0YS,A very good movie and kept you trying to work out as to what will happen next.,1446595200,,78,3.6470588235294117
6656883,5,B00NHVC0YS,WWII is a terrible tragic event and the related human stories resonate with me.  This is one such story and I recommend it highly.  The story illustrates the British politics and societal prejudices of the time while conveying an exciting race to protect Britain from German aircraft.  This is a true story of a genius who lost so much to invent the one thing that is still essential to our safety today.  An important story about one of the unsung heroes of WWII.,1446163200,16,464,4.554216867469879
6656884,3,B00NHVC0YS,"Eddie Izzard was a pleasant surprise as the lead in this WWII movie about a little known contribution to Britain's success in preparing for the German Luftwaffe bombings, about how radar was perfected to allow the RAF to get in the skies quickly.  The story was slow and in dull in places, but the reward was when the technicians finally overcame the hands on problems as well as the skepticism of the RAF command and the politicians. Izzard was anything but the flamboyant flash he usually plays. He is a fine actor in appropriate roles like this one.",1445904000,,552,4.63265306122449
6656885,5,B00NHVC0YS,"1935. Hitler is building faster and lighter aircraft, and hes building a lot of them. The Fhrer isn't admitting it publicly, yet, but these are warplanes. England, in the meanwhile, has just started to build a modern air force.

In London, a meeting attended by the government and the military is called to decide how to allocate their limited funds. For new aircraft, of course. But Professor Lindemann also pushes for a defensive weapon, because an invasion surely will come. He wants a Death Ray. Henry Tizard and his aide, A.P. Rowe, are given the assignment of finding the men who will build this weapon.

Now, they cant just put out a newspaper advertisement looking to hire Death Ray inventors, this is hush-hush. So they DO put out a help-wanted ad, but they try to word it cleverly to disguise what they're really looking for. There follows some comic interviews with researchers and inventors, and then the last man in the waiting room bustles in.

Hes a weatherman, Robert Watson Watt, and he wasn't fooled by the ads wording: I know what you're up to. Youre worried about the Germans. Eight pints of water equals eight pints of blood. The distance and height specified = an aeroplane. Ergo, you're wanting some kind of weapon that will vaporize pilots in their cockpits, aren't you?
Tizard, not admitting anything: Will you begin your presentation please?
Watt: The thing you propose doesnt work. It never will work. But hes got a better idea. A locating device using radio waves. And he explains his proposal.
Rowe to Tizard: Hes an idiot.
Tizard: Perhaps. But out of all the ideas weve heard today
Rowe: His is the  least idiotic?

This history lover thoroughly enjoyed Castles in the Sky.  Though a lot of the story appears fictionalized, it is an engaging, fun story. I love its essence, which is that scientific progress is often made through simple slogging with occasional flashes of intuition. You try this. You hobble together that. You beat your head against the blackboard and then you try something else. This is Edison and his 1,000 lightbulb filaments, except the stakes for Watson Watt and his team were much higher.  Five years later, July 1940, the Battle of Britain began, and England was given a fighting chance with Watson Watts castles in the sky.

There are no bonus extras on the single-disc for Castles in the Sky, which is too bad. I would love to know if the telephone test of the Cambridge professor was based on a real event. It cracked me up! I also suspect that an out-take reel would be fun, because the first time the actor said ""I want a Death Ray"", the whole table had to have broken up.

The BBC is issuing, in late October 2015, The World War II Collection (not yet available on amazon as I write this). It will combine four WWII TV shows, including Castles in the Sky. The other three are:

6656886,5,B00NHVC0YS,"Excellent.  Combine radar with code-breaking and spying and great pilots and you have a pantheon of ""how they won WWII.""  Take your pick of How.  Oh, and don't forget the Bomb, as equally-dramatized in MANHATTAN.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote that it takes 50 years for prejudices to fade, and here it seems to take much longer.  History is very slippery and Drama must fill in missing information, sometimes accurate and sometimes false.  This series appears to have it right.  The UK has lots of great actors, indeed.  And directors and writers.  This movie deserves several re-watches.  NOTE:  the requirement of different Region Code is easily and inexpensively solved by a new Blu-ray player.  The one I have just lets you select the Code when it is turned-Off by entering the number on the remote.  No excuses anymore from the manual for complexity.  Delivery from the UK was really fast.",1432512000,32,888,4.87248322147651
6656887,4,B00NHVC0YS,"This is a commendable attempt to make the process of actually `doing' science and technology a bit `sexy' through the story of British boffins, just before the outbreak of World War II, inventing one of the early forms of Radio Detection and Ranging, or, as the US Navy later referred to it, RADAR. To some extent it works as we witness the establishment of a team of suitably eccentric egg-heads led by Robert Watson Watt (Eddie Izzard) gradually persuade the initially somewhat skeptical `powers that be' that it could make a vital contribution to the air defence of the realm when hostilities with Germany actually began.

Watt's unconventional team drew from most corners of the British Isles: he was Scottish and a worthy descendant from James Watt; his chief assistant, Arnold `Skip' Wilkins (Karl Davies), English; and the cricket loving Edward `Taffy' Bowen (Celyn Jones), Welsh, amongst others. Predictably, they are given little money, shabby accommodation, scarcely functioning equipment and, perhaps most tellingly of all, held in barely concealed contempt by the influential and somewhat odious Frederick Lindemann, played convincingly with relish by David Hayman. Lindemann did his best to discredit Watts' efforts and tried to use his close relationship with Churchill, who, although out of government, always had his own `secret sources of information', to obstruct the team's progress. Fortunately, on this occasion Churchill's instinct that their efforts might prove fruitful overcame his tendency to defer to Lindemann on scientific and technical matters. (Lindemann is an interesting character in himself being, of German origin, and simultaneously an almost rabid anti-Nazi and believer in eugenics and the possibility of genetically engineering a race of `super-beings'; characteristics which, however, are not pursued in this programme).

Eventually, following a semi-successful demonstration to various government officials, including Air Marshall, Sir Hugh Dowding, head of RAF Fighter Command, Watt and his team were able to secure greater funding and rather more salubrious quarters.

Ultimately, the attempt to make science (at least appear) sexy doesn't quite succeed; the only hint of sexiness being supplied is in the form of Laura Fraser who plays Watt's long-suffering wife, Margaret! Nevertheless, it has a certain charm and continues the delineation of `war wizardry' begun almost fifty years previously in, arguably, a rather more successful attempt by British classic, `The Dam Busters'.",1423267200,48,2524,5.584856396866841
6656888,5,B00NHVC0YS,"I give this movie a five, but unless you enjoy history as I do; you may not find this as entertaining. I agree with a previous review about miscasting of the Prime Minister, and a few minor inaccuracies; however, I wish there were more movies like this. This is a prime example to young people to never give up. During this time in history, the British had the hell knocked out of them; they were down, but never out. Robert Watson Watt (Developed Radar), R J Mitchell (Designed the Spitfire), and later Alan Turing (Broke the Nazi Enigma code). These three men saved England in my opinion with their ""don't give up attitude"". The RAF was outnumbered three to one, but they overcame these odds with radar, initially the Hurricane, and later the Spitfire. Many people never knew those brave RAF pilots used their wingtips to knock V1 rockets off course. (This was not part of the movie) Sir Winston summed up the RAF in one sentence: ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few""",1508976000,,1009,4.489130434782608
6656889,5,B00NHVC0YS,"THIS BBC FOR-TELEVISION MOVIE PROVIDES AN ENTERTAINING INTRODUCTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRITAIN'S  RADAR DEFENSE SYSTEM (""CASTLES IN THE SKY"") AGAINST NAZI GERMANY.  AS ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE FILM, LICENSE IS TAKEN WITH SOME FACTS AND, OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS  STORY ARC AND EFFORT TO MAKE THE SUBJECT/STORY ENTERTAINING.  I PURCHASED THE DVD AFTER STREAMING THE MOVIE ON AMAZON.
IN SUM:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BBC MOVIE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF RADAR AND WWII DEFENSE OF ENGLAND.
ROBERT WATSON-WATT'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ALLIES DEFENSE WERE NEITHER UNRECOGNIZED NOR UNHERALDED.  IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT FOLLOWING THE TIME PERIOD ADDRESSED IN THIS MOVIE, ROBERT WATSON-WATT WAS SENT TO THE US (IN 1941) TO ADVISE THE U.S. ABOUT AIR DEFENSE FOLLOWING JAPANS ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR. AFTER HIS RETURN TO THE U.K. HE CONTINUED HIS LEADERSHIP OF RADAR DEVELOPMENT FOR THE WAR MINISTRY AND MINISTRY OF SUPPLY. IN 1941 HE WAS ELECTED A FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND, IN 1942, HE WAS KNIGHTED. THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON AWARDS TO INVENTORS AWARDED SIR ROBERT 50,000 FOR HIS WORK ON RADAR. IN 1946 HE WAS AWARDED THE U.S. MEDAL FOR MERIT.  IT IS FITTING THAT HIS CONTRIBUTION AND THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE ALLIES AND THE DEFENSE OF BRITAIN BY OTHERS PORTRAYED IN THIS FILM ARE REMEMBERED.",1503014400,2,1277,5.052380952380952
6656890,3,B00NHVC0YS,Interesting but very slow moving . So if you can hang in there it worth it,1502323200,,74,3.6875
6656891,5,B00NHVC0YS,"Excellent docu-drama about Robert Watson-Watt, a meteorologist/Scotsman whose vision and scientific brilliance were not readily recognized in 1930's class-bound British society due to his slight eccentrictiy and ""lack of credentials,"" but who nonetheless laid the foundations for the fundamentals of what we know today as radar.  In doing so, he saved the United Kingdom from extinction at the hands of Hitler and the Nazis, for during the Battle of Britain, it was radar, Hawker Hurricanes, and Supermarine Spitfires, in that order, that saved England and its empire.  I add this last bit not to disrespect any of the men and women involved, for nothing would have happened without them, but to point out that as far as this film is concerned, the Hawker Hurricane -- which formed two-thirds of RAF Fight Command's operational strength during the battle -- did not exist.

An interesting note in the film is the pivotal role played by Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, in greenlighting continued funding and support for Watson-Watt's research, when in-fighting and competition for scarce funds threatened to shut it down at a time when Britain was struggling to find the best options to deal with the looming threat of war.

The scene in which Watson-Watt is excluded -- more precisely, expelled -- from the first operational wartime demonstration of what the British called the ""Chain Home"" system (as the Battle of Britain is beginning to unfold) may have involved artistic embellishment on the part of the movie producers, but it was nonetheless infuriating and heartbreaking, with a dash of insult for good measure.  But at the end of the movie we learn in the postscript that the universe righted itself -- the man whose drive and vision had done so much to save the UK from the Nazis, was acknowledged in 1942 with a knighthood -- and rightly bloody so.",1501632000,,1879,5.009615384615385

6656893,5,B00NHVC0YS,"This is an interesting and, for the most part, factual history of the development of RADAR, in England, at the start of WW2. However, the scene, which depicted Mr. Watt being told to leave the reviewing room, when the first real use of his project was put into action, appears to be a dramatic addition, without basis.

He was a backbencher in the Commons until becoming first Lord of the Admiralty in Sept. 1939. Also I have to say that the actor who played Churchill was miscast.

6656963,2,B00NHVC0YS,What a disappointment.  What could have been an interesting story was a predictable and mediocre film with feeble attempts at humor.  The characters were staged and unconvincing.  Terrible choice of actor for Churchill and not very believable character of of Watson-Watts' wife,1449100800,3,277,5.5476190476190474

6656967,3,B00NHVC0YS,"You have to be a real WWII buff to stay interested in the story, which is intriguing but a bit slow.  It's well-cast and the settings are excellent, but the two-steps-forward, one-step-back storyline made me want to speed it up a little with the remote!  Also, as an admirer of Winston Churchill, I was really put off by the actor chosen to portray the great man.  He made him seem like a bloated, mean, not-very-bright leader who made the decision to go with radar simply by accident.  Churchill was nothing like this!  However, the film does accurately show how much these men sacrificed and struggled to realize their dream.  A very educational film.",1448668800,2,653,4.734513274336283

6656970,5,B00NHVC0YS,"By 1935 the British Air Ministry was aware the Nazi-German gov't. was building very large numbers of military airplanes. They saw a great danger to Britain and took a decision to put out discreet feelers for ideas on weapons for destroying aircraft in flight. A science advisor for the gov't. envisioned a high energy ""death ray"" which would kill the pilot and he resisted any other approach to the problem.
A group of proposals was tendered; the only one which seemed likely to succeed was made by a Scottish engineer, Robert Watson-Watt, who was working as a weatherman at the National Physical Laboratory. The gov't. liaison manager recommended contacting Oxford and Cambridge Universities for the best physicists and mathematicians, but Watt insisted on using men from the Weather Laboratory to build his team.
After overcoming almost overwhelming obstacles, the system they developed was successful at spotting and tracking aircraft at distances up to more than 100 miles, and enabled RAF Hurricanes and Spitfires to be scrambled in time to intercept attacking German planes before they reached the English coast.
The system Robert Watson-Watt's team developed became known as ""radar."" Radar enabled the RAF to win the Battle of Britain and prevent a German invasion.
This is a story of triumph, excellently acted, and magnificently told.",1447804800,20,1343,5.251162790697674

6656973,5,B00NHVC0YS,"There are so many excellent reviewers out there; I hope they make a contribution here.  Just let me add my little uneducated bit.  I found this movie very uplifting and entertaining and moving.  It's the story of the man and his team, who, out of pure necessity, and on a shoe-string budget, conceived and invented the basics of Radar before the beginning of WWII in Great Britain.  You'll wonder why you never heard of him before.",1447113600,,431,4.631578947368421

6656976,5,B00NHVC0YS,"Our society simply does not value intellectuals.  Well, intellectuals(nerds if you like) ,engineers and scientists, have built the modern world.  Here is an example of how such folks built the radar system that saved the country during the Battle of Britain.  Great movie.",1446768000,,272,5.27906976744186
6656977,5,B00NHVC0YS,"Excellent drama on the invention of radar. British authorities see the threat of German bombing. Solicit bids for a 'death ray'. No winners. However, one, a weatherman! offers a detection ray. The drama henceforth focuses on the uphill fight to support a 'weatherman' instead of British academia.

One precious scene has Watt defending his fellow weathermen. His boss wants Oxford professors, they 'will obey orders'. Watt picks up the phone, calls an Oxford professor and directs him to put his phone in a fish tank. He obeyed this nonsensical order and destroyed his phone. Point made. No professors needed. Great!

Drama includes conflicts among the staff, stress of inventing to order, dread of German bombing, where to find new electronics and other obstacles. The strain on Watt's wife is shown.

However, the primary tension is the constant threat of replacing the weathermen with ones with higher status. Makes for exciting movie. Concludes with the 'authorities' expelling him from the room on the day when radar saves Britain.
Poignant.
Unfair.
Arrogant.
Sad.
Great drama!

8678301,5,B00NHVC0YS,"Robert Alexander Watson-Watt was a Scottish man, who had this idea of shooting off a high-frequency pulse and listen back to its echo from a far away object, like a German Messerschmitt heavy fighter. Knowing the time of pulse sent, and when the echo received determined how far the Germans were from the British island, so Royal Air Force squadrons could be sent in time to greet the belligerents.

This movie is about that moment in the early  part of World War II, when Watson-Watt, along with Arnold Frederic Wilkins, trying to convince the powers that be (like Henry Tizard) at that time of how to create a mesh of radar stations to protect United Kingdom.

As impressive as radar was in WW2, what's equally, if not more, impressive is the dramatic acting chops of Eddie Izzard, who is arguably the greatest living comic today.",1529366400,,832,4.724137931034483
8678302,5,B00NHVC0YS,"SOME SPOILERS...SORRY! This film has a stirling cast, but Eddie Izzard's portrayal of Mr. Watt is wonderful. Mr. Watt was looked down upon by the aristocracy because he was ""just a mere weatherman"" but he proved that one needn't have the pedigree of an elitist, but rather the pedigree of a 'true, free-thinking' man. This is a wonderful film which also allows us to enjoy Eddie Izzard's fine acting skills which resonant with depth & reach. We have much to thank Mr. Watt & his team for inventing radar, since most of today's technology piggy-backed their existence from his/their ideas. This is an uplifting film that proves when we come together as a unified people & realize we all have the same positive, common goals to achieve, such thinking allows us the capability to create magickal ideas to flow. By working together we then parley such ideas into a limitless, unified reality. An inspiring film about a truly great 'ordinary' man. Bravo!",1526083200,,949,4.864197530864198

8678304,5,B00NHVC0YS,"This movie made prime barbecue out of stones and vines.  The essence of the challenges - dramatized but not mathematically enumerated (which I could have wished for ... though not the estrangement of the mathematically challenged) - was brought about by a small team.  You can tell this film was low budget but all the actors were good - even Izzard, a stand-up comedienne.  The low budget of the production found realistic source in the low budget of the fledgling radar team's setting.

Brilliant story about intelligent, not brilliant, nor well-born men, hashing out together a technology that would allow Britain to withstand the Luftwaffe with 1/3rd it's planes.",1523491200,,667,5.091743119266055
8678305,4,B00NHVC0YS,"It is about the invention of RADAR and how close the program came to being shut down, several times. I had not realized how decisive the technology was in ""holding off"" the Germans in the Battle of Brittain. How different would world history be if that program had been shut down? It seems like the Germans would have successfully invaded the UK, long before we entered the war, if that technology had not been able to tell the RAF where and when to scramble their limited fighters.

8678309,5,B00NHVC0YS,"This is a wonderfully plotted and acted out film detailing the exploits of Watson Watt. It showed his perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, especially from Lindemann, the German Prof from Oxford held in high esteem by Churchill. His actions are well presented yet the actor lacked his German accent which would have highlighted is overall obnoxious behavior.

The development of what became radar was presented but in a non technical manner. The need to develop ""beamed"" antennae, power sources for transmitters and most importantly the ""system"" that integrated it with the RAF deployment was alluded to but left somewhat hanging. The last scene where Watt sees the RAF control was well done but one wonders how this jump may have been made.

It would have been useful to have had some technical discussion but understanding a general audience this would have been difficult. I knew people who knew Watt and as best I gather his depiction was well done. I had the good fortune to have one of RV Jones staff work for me in the 70s and also to have had my MIT Office in the old RADLAB buildings. Thus perhaps my closeness may result in some nit picking but overall this was a great human drama. Well worth the viewing! BBC at its best.",1514937600,,1242,4.692660550458716
