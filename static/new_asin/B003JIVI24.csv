4129817,5,B003JIVI24,"I saw this film at a festival, and it made me cry.  Tears of anger at first and then tears of joy at the end.  This is the ultimate story of redemption and teaches the power of love and tolerance.  I highly recommend that everyone see this, especially if they are gay and trying to come out to their families or if someone is struggling to come to grips with a family member who has just come out.  This film is for you.",1274918400,8,420,4.024096385542169
4129838,4,B003JIVI24,"After reading some of the poor reviews, I was hesitant to watch this movie, but it was free on Prime so I decided to watch it.  At first the movie did not seem very good to me, and I could understand all the bad reviews.  However, about a third of the way through the movie, the view of all of the characters lives changed and it really caught my interest.  The story was very powerful.  The shooting of the film could use some improvement, but the film overall was pretty good.  If you can make it through the first third of the movie, you may be pleasantly surprised.",1398556800,2,569,4.231481481481482
4129839,3,B003JIVI24,"I choose to rate this movie 3 stars because I like the idea for the movie, but the way that the idea is portrayed is jerky.  The viewer must piece together what is happening, and by the time that has happened, the story is half way through, and it feels disjointed.  The premise has been used before, and if the acting were just a little bit better, it might be pulled off with a bit more credibility.  However, the topic needs to be understood more in today's world, so for that I give it 3 stars because the focus is important.",1393459200,,529,4.217821782178218
4129840,2,B003JIVI24,"This movie's storyline has promise. It could have been important, in the hands of experienced filmmakers with the resources to do it justice.  As it is, viewers are forced to follow amateurish, wooden actors as they attempt to emote their way through every imaginable cliche.

I applaud the filmmakers' passion and the effort that went into trying to talk about the devastating consequences of bigotry. Unfortunately, the production values are so poor that the movie appears to have been put together by a bunch of kids who took a few film school courses, and borrowed some equipment. The result is way too many flashbacks, strange scenes that use lighting effects to set the mood, and odd, laggy sound. Even the background music feels contrived.

As a contender in an amateur film festival, ""Change of Life"" would be interesting, but, when it has to compete with professionally produced and acted movies, it's outclassed.. And that's a shame, because, minus its hackneyed writing and cliched characters, this could have gotten its message out to many more people.",1389916800,,1064,5.0685714285714285
4129841,2,B003JIVI24,I just felt the whole movie was dealing with homophobic people and the acting was awful.  I never finished watching it,1386806400,,118,4.619047619047619
4129842,1,B003JIVI24,"The description of this film is totally inadequate, and should be amended to include more information. I did not expect it to be about hatred, especially religious based hatred. I watch this type of film to try and understand why people would want to treat other people so horribly. Film is not simply to entertain, but to inform and create understanding. Gay cinema is always striving for understanding. This film was so hurtful, I did not watch the entire film.",1383523200,,463,4.8
4129843,2,B003JIVI24,"Bad dialogue,, bad acting, cliched plot, bad directing.  It beats you over the he'd with a message and tries to educate you at the same time. Don't do it",1379808000,,153,4.275862068965517
4129844,1,B003JIVI24,"I started watching this movie because it was available in the GLBT category of Prime Instant Videos. After 10 minutes I started considering whether I had the gumption to keep watching. It was just plain out bad...horrible acting, low budget. I was out of there 5 minutes later and there ain't no going back.

Be afraid, be very afraid!!",1378944000,,336,4.694915254237288
4129845,1,B003JIVI24,The title of my review says it all. Don't waste your time on this movie. Better stuff out there for sure.,1377734400,,105,4.0476190476190474
4129846,3,B003JIVI24,"This is a low budget film - the camera work and acting are not going to win any awards. But the message is worth putting up with the mediocre production values. Three stars might be a bit generous, but, as I said earlier, when the theme is redemption, the generosity is warranted. Oh, and you might learn something about the story of Johah.",1372636800,4,340,4.412698412698413
4129847,2,B003JIVI24,This moive was not what I expected.  The title led me to believe the plot was a lot full circle.,1371945600,,96,3.8
4129868,2,B003JIVI24,"There is not much to recommend here. Poorly acted, poorly filmed and poorly written. Pass on this one. I do realize that there were probably budget restrictions.",1367193600,,161,5.0
4129869,4,B003JIVI24,I liked this movie because it does happen in the real world and so many people are effected this type of situation.  What seems to be real in relationships sometimes is done to make the people seem normal.  I didn't think the doctors' job would be in question because of his being gay.,1366243200,3,285,4.3584905660377355
4129870,2,B003JIVI24,"The story line was good, but not very well executed. It was okay, but very slow and had the low budget feel.",1363737600,,108,3.9545454545454546
4129871,1,B003JIVI24,This movie was not what I expected.  Difficult to follow and far to much wasted film time on the protestors....,1356998400,,111,4.55
4129872,1,B003JIVI24,"I can handle the bad camera quality because i know what low budget is like.  But the horrendous script and bad acting was really hard to swallow.  Also, they make the religious guy so far out there that it seems impossible to relate to in any way, so unbelievable that this will never reach them in any way...i'm not sure if his acting was that horrible or if it was the script and how they were filming but it was just bad... the lesbian sexy scene was god-awful...everything...bad bad... very disappointed because i liked the idea for the movie which is why i suffered through the whole thing...sigh glad it was free on netflicks....speaking of how the heck did it make it to netflicks???",1337040000,,690,4.556451612903226
4129873,1,B003JIVI24,"I rented this because I thought the plot was an interesting idea and it is an interesting idea.  I know it's low budget, but it could have been done so much better.  If you've got talent and a good script, you can turn low budget into something great.  Sadly, the writing behind this was horrible.  The dialog made me cringe.  The acting is just as bad, if not worse.  Finally, the sound is pretty bad too.  I kept waiting for something redeeming, but it never came.  The only good thing about this movie is that there were a couple of beautiful shots, but that doesn't even make it worth the $2.99 rental or the time I wasted watching it.",1330214400,2,639,4.310924369747899
4129874,1,B003JIVI24,"Wow, this was the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  I wanted to turn it off after the 1st 15 minutes but was hoping it would improve.  I should have turned it off.

The story line is of a bigoted minister whose daughter is a lesbian and his views change during the course of the movie.  Right off the bat the daughter's lifelong best friend is killed in a hate crime.  The movie gets confusing when the father either has a dream or is thinking that his daughter killed herself (the movie doesn't make it clear which) and the father turns into the dead best friends boyfriend.  He goes through all of the trials and tribulations associated with being a gay male and ends up stopping the boyfriend from being killed by acting like a complete sissy!

The acting was horrible the lesbian ""love scene"", if you could call it one, looked completely fake and ridiculous.  Several parts in the movie did not make sense for example they kept showing a photograph of the daughter (looking like a teenager) and her mother however though flashbacks the mother apparently died prior to age 4 or 5.

This was a waste of my time and money.  I'm glad I only rented and did not purchase!",1324166400,,1174,4.4186046511627906
4129875,5,B003JIVI24,"Beautiful movie maybe not HD but amazing story so true. I would recommended it to everyone.
I think all of us should watch it. We want to change the world while we are not even trying to change ourselves. This world is our. We are existing here and We should change our behavior. If you are not gay you don/t even know how hard it is to be one in this world. People hate you ,destroy you .LIFE,HEALING,SUN,NATURE,HARMONY AND SPIRIT",1322524800,3,431,4.4
4129876,4,B003JIVI24,"This movie was superb, especially for low budget gay/lesbian themed drama. However, you could apply the elements of bigotry the main character held and direct it toward any group and I see the story as thematically holding strong. As other reviewers have mentioned the same prior, I am really just resounding the same! This will not be a waste, I assure you. Also, if you are like me and have netflix and find it on their ""instant"" - it really isn't. I think it's a directors commentary over the film the whole time. I started trying to watch there and didn't work, so just spend your money here, it's a bargain anyhow!

Not to give too much away, but I found it particularly moving midway through and things had switched over. I hope it can help any out there who might still struggle with people in your life who think it's a ""choice"" or what not. Midway, we find the reverend in quite a new role, so to speak, and as we all know - much like I shudder at the thought of making out with a man - you can't just ""choose"" to be gay. Kudos for this film. The acting, writing and filming were just spot-on. Def drama, so on the love-meter - 4: chillax, but don't expect romance in the boudoir.

As always, pop the corn, here's your soda, don't drop milk duds on the white carpet, and pass the remote",1314921600,5,1295,4.30327868852459
4129877,5,B003JIVI24,"I really loved and enjoyed this film!!! You do not need to be gay or lesbian in order to relate or enjoy this film. It has an important theme which is all about acceptance of others and the negative consequences of hate and bigotry. This is a thought provoking film that everyone needs to see. Although this is mostly a serious drama the film did have some laughable moments that gave one little breaks from the serious heaviness. There were moments that did cause me to cry out of sadness and joy. Also, the acting was very good especially the acting of the man who played the bigoted minister main character. This film made me pause and think about my own life, my childhood and my relationship with my father. We all need to take a step back sometimes and really try to feel what its like to be in others ""shoes"" in order to become more loving, understanding, and accepting.

I bought 3 DVD's to give to members of my family for Christmas.",1290729600,14,942,4.413793103448276

Did Reverend Catell's daughter kill herself midway and the rest of what happened after that was a dream of an alternate reality or what?",1437436800,,176,4.67741935483871
