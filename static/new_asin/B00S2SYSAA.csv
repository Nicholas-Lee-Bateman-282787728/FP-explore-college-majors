6950890,4,B00S2SYSAA,Nice production. I love live theatre on DVD.,1433289600,,44,4.625
6950891,5,B00S2SYSAA,Wonderful live performance! I particularly love seeing Brent Carver as Friar Lawrence. A great role for him!,1433289600,2,108,5.411764705882353
6950892,3,B00S2SYSAA,I wanted to like it. I really did. Orlando Bloom seems to be trying a little bit too hard and the cuts irked me to no end. Props for the modern setting and the set design. Rest of the cast was pretty good. But I'll pass on adding it to my collection.,1431388800,6,250,3.826923076923077
6950893,1,B00S2SYSAA,"One of the worst versions of R&J I've seen.  The acting is awful, even from Bloom, who looks every bit the part, but plays to the balcony, not the heroine, who is too young and inexperienced to get the material of the poetry of Juliet's speeches.  No chemistry at all from the two leads. They never exude any passion. Attempts at humor do not work. The actress who plays Lady Capulet has no grasp of the material and plays the character like this is an off broadway version of ""Raisin In The Sun"", not a great Shakespearean drama. A noble experiment gone terribly wrong. Such a pity.",1430697600,6,583,4.4392523364485985
6950894,5,B00S2SYSAA,I really loved this production.  I actually liked it more the second and third time around.  I just rented this on instant watch and will be pre-ordering the DVD version to add to my Shakespeare collection!,1428451200,,206,4.694444444444445
6950895,5,B00S2SYSAA,"Really well done. Engaging acting, action, music, props, sets - beautifully working with Shakespeare's words.",1426809600,2,109,6.333333333333333
6950896,5,B00S2SYSAA,Very well done adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet! Orlando Bloom did a fantastic job playing the role!!!,1426636800,4,114,5.388888888888889
6950897,5,B00S2SYSAA,It's awesome! All the actors were beyond amazing and expressed themselves eloquently in Shakespeare's language. The actors sort of put their own twist on their character. The music was bold and crisp in each scene.,1426118400,6,214,5.142857142857143
6950898,5,B00S2SYSAA,"I loved this! I tend to like the stage versions of any Shakespeare play better than movie versions, but it's always challenging to find a professionally, effectively filmed version of the plays. What's great about the stage is the way that the actors play off the audience and that the characters are working in a fixed environment. This is what Shakespeare's language was intended for. Many movie adaptations are wonderful, but the language is always a bit in the extras of a film--the music, the visual effects, etc.

Both of the actors, being classically trained stage actors, know how to use their whole bodies to express the language, not simply their faces. This play is set in an updated, modern environment, but the language still works beautifully.",1424908800,18,757,4.960629921259843
6950899,5,B00S2SYSAA,"The modern setting was effective to bring the ideas into a current time frame.  The actors showed real feeling and yet keep the poetry of Shakespeare's lines, those that were direct from the play. They were very expressive.  Orlando Bloom was very strong in this role showing us the romanticism and yet keeping the virility of the role.",1424649600,8,336,4.775862068965517
6950930,5,B00S2SYSAA,This was a gift. She was very happy with it!,1485734400,,44,3.5
6950931,5,B00S2SYSAA,"Amazing, black family vs white family vision of ""Romeo and Juliet"" starring Orlando Bloom. Perfect for inclusion of African-Americans into a traditionally all-white play. Beautifully staged and acted!",1485388800,,200,6.178571428571429
6950932,5,B00S2SYSAA,"Superb acting brings the Bard's masterpiece to life for a new generation. As a teacher of a multi-racial class, it is refreshing to offer this version. We were in tears at the end.",1481846400,2,180,4.484848484848484

6950934,4,B00S2SYSAA,It was pretty good! I would love to own it!,1473379200,,43,3.4
6950935,2,B00S2SYSAA,"This version reeks.  It is embarrassingly bad.  There is no real emotion, just actors parroting lines.  Stick to earlier versions.",1473292800,,130,5.4
6950936,5,B00S2SYSAA,Great. So artistically authentic.,1471046400,,33,7.5
6950937,1,B00S2SYSAA,"I bought this to use in school. My own fault I guess, I could NOT use it in the school computer because it was ONLY blu-Ray...not DVD!",1467849600,,134,4.0
6950938,5,B00S2SYSAA,I like this play because its a unique introduction of r and j.,1463788800,,62,3.8461538461538463
6950939,5,B00S2SYSAA,"We showed the play in class after reading Romeo & Juliet.  We found that the kids really liked the production.  The play mixed modern elements (costumes, music, dance) with dialogue that was very faithful to the play that they read.",1463011200,9,232,4.775

6950951,5,B00S2SYSAA,Loved it!,1453593600,,9,4.0
6950952,3,B00S2SYSAA,"I enjoyed this production, but some of the characters were horrible.  I did not like the actor that played Mercutio!  He was not believable, and his slimy demeanor took away from the play, rather than added to it.  I mean, him opening up his pants to fight, and pumping another actor on the floor?, Really?  He was not likable at all, and could not act, so he basically stuck to stupid mannerisms.  Another actor that didn't work for me was Juilet's mom.  Why was she such a sour pus the entire play?  Serious-looking, never smiling, rock hard...she didn't do a good job either.  The others were okay, but Bloom looked a bit distracted...It was a reasonably well attempt at a classic, and had sweet moments, but three stars is all I can give it.",1453507200,8,745,4.507462686567164
6950953,5,B00S2SYSAA,"I loved it. The acting, the minimal sets, the use of fire.",1440374400,,58,3.9166666666666665

6950955,3,B00S2SYSAA,"I keep looking for a good version of Romeo and Juliet to use in my English class. This is not it.  I was told it was better than others, but that is not high praise.  You would think that someone could make a really good versions one of these days.",1437264000,6,248,3.94
6950956,4,B00S2SYSAA,Orlando makes a great Romeo.,1436486400,,28,4.8
6950957,5,B00S2SYSAA,I love this version. It's great to have a Broadway version of the play.,1435449600,,71,4.142857142857143
6950958,5,B00S2SYSAA,I love it about time a interracial romeo and Julie was done. I'm a black woman who proudly dates white men and I'm glad when movies focus on it. The only downer they had to die. But alas great had I been Shakespeare  and wrote it. They would have left town came back a year or so later and not seeing them would have given their parents time in their absences to see what idiots they were.,1435276800,5,389,4.0519480519480515

8697139,5,B00S2SYSAA,"I am an English teacher and I use this version with students.  It is beautifully done and most of the cast is stunning. Orlando Bloom is a TERRIBLE Romeo, but that leads to great discussions about what the words actually mean and how Bloom's presentation and choices don't match the meaning of the words, forcing the students to think about the language.",1522713600,,354,4.709677419354839
8697140,2,B00S2SYSAA,Just ok.  He was way too old for Romeo,1522540800,,38,3.2222222222222223
8697141,1,B00S2SYSAA,Won't play. European DVD code.,1514592000,,30,5.2
8697142,5,B00S2SYSAA,"It would be difficult to miss even one word in this production. Every line is clearly spoken and well-acted without being over-acted. Very different from most modernized versions of Shakespeare plays, where actors mumble their way through lines they obviously don't comprehend.

And the director actually understood the bawdy side of the dialogue and made sure it came through! I've been amazed at how many Shakespeare plays end up neutered. Whole sections simply removed.

This production proves that Shakespeare is still alive and not merely a historical reenactment.",1511913600,,569,5.454545454545454
8697143,4,B00S2SYSAA,Arrived as promised...,1500854400,,22,6.666666666666667
8697144,2,B00S2SYSAA,"Worst version ever.  In this retread, Romeo's British accent fades in an out like a lighthouse, and his over-coached delivery lacks sincerity.  And every time Juliet utters her lines, her inflection pointlessly crash-lands on some unimportant word in each sentence, it's an odd effect and disturbs the story.  Well, at least these 2""Thespians"" can add this film to their resumes.",1491350400,,379,5.283333333333333
8697145,2,B00S2SYSAA,"I realized that it was a stage production and actors have to speak loudly, but IMO there was way, way, way too much melodramatic screaming in places that did not call for such histrionics.  That made many scenes very distracting.  I thought Juliet was the best acted, and when Romeo and Mercutio were not screaming, they were good, too.  But the overt, gratuitous sexual physicality of the gang members was entirely uncalled for, and embarrassing to see actors use those antics to illicit laughs.",1489795200,,496,4.880952380952381
8697146,4,B00S2SYSAA,"I bought this version to share with my high school students as we study the play. This version of Romeo and Juliet has some excellent moments, some really great actors, some interesting staging... and the rest just feels good, but not excellent.

First of all, Juliet, played by Condola Rashad, delivers one of the most memorable balcony scenes that captures the energy of a young girl who has just fallen head over heels for the dashing Romeo. Her rapid dialogue and bright-eyed delivery makes for both a romantic and comical interpretation. My students and I laughed out loud at her jittery energy; the movie is worth seeing just for this moment. Her father, played by Chuck Cooper, is quite frankly a presence on the stage. He captures the gusto, strength, and cutting voice of Lord Capulet and gives one of the better performances seen on screen. Both of their performances add interest and a fresh feel to these ancient roles. But it is the Nurse, played by Jayne Houdyshell, who takes charge. She is a total scene stealer. Her delivery of her lines in her opening scene masterfully translates the archaic language for a modern audience. She, in my opinion, holds up many of the scenes with her icy, untrusting glares and her deep, authoritative voice. My students loved her authority and always looked forward to watching scenes with her. Romeo, played by Orlando Bloom, does a decent job. At times he seems to overreach and awkwardly holds a stance or a stare off into the audience (and even more awkwardly, into the camera).  He does a fine job, but  his is not my favorite performance.

There are many others who contribute to this being a ""good"" version, but probably more importantly is the crew's work to include both modern and Elizabethan-feeling elements into one show. The set's minimalistic perspective works--it feels Shakespearian. The backdrop for many of the scenes mimics a Renaissance painting, but is overlaid with marks of modern graffiti and is occasionally accented with scaffolding bearing real fire. The characters wear mostly generic, could-be-from-most-time-periods clothing with modern twists--hoodies, visible tattoos, and hipster boots. All of these details add a nice touch.

However, distracting, and quite frankly silly, is the motorcycle on which Romeo enters. Something about his entrance announced: ""We are trying too hard."" In addition to this, there were a few moments throughout the production where the camera angle would shift to show a different actor on stage in a somewhat awkward or jarring way--two come to mind that made me wonder why the editor didn't favor a full stage shot over the closeups selected for this film version.  Unfortunately, small details like the motorcycle, staring into the camera, or an awkward cut here and there did take away from the impact of this show.

All in all, it is a good version, a funny version, and a version from which students will learn.  Cheers!",1487203200,4,2937,4.991820040899795
8697147,3,B00S2SYSAA,"meh - the overacting is a but much for me - Romeo and Juliet are the downfall of this production, especially Bloom.",1486598400,,115,4.2727272727272725
