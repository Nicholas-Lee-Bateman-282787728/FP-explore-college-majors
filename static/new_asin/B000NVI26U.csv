8181875,1,B000NVI26U,"If you expected, like I did when I bought this ""product"", to be seeing AC/DC perform some legendary performances, you're gonna be very disappointed. The band is excellent, and while the sound is sometimes compromised, what annoyed the hell out of me was the various clowns who inadvertently interrupted these videos with their own wax and wane on the band's importance at that point. The result is, you get enticed into their playing, and then suddenly, the band becomes the background while these ""journalists"" sit on comfy couches and babble about the band. I say, ""shut up and let me see the band perform"". I don't need anybody telling me what they're doing while they're doing it. These people are as annoying as radio ""personalities""! VERY DISAPPOINTED. And it's funny, that throughout, not one band member talks, except for Brian who is interviewed in 1980. Cheezy.",1220572800,10,871,4.972602739726027
