1692410,4,B000063V14,"This was a cool movie - maybe just a little much for a 3 yr old, but I haveta say that my son was engrossed the entire movie; we took him to see Monsters, Inc, and Shrek and he got anstsy towards the end but this one held his attention the whole time.
From my somewhat older ;) perspective I was entertained and amused by the movie as well. The animation was well done based on the style and the sound design was cool too; besides any soundtrack that has a Ramones song (Blitzkrieg Bop) PLUS the ""chicken dance"" in it works for me!",1011052800,,531,4.115384615384615
1692411,5,B000063V14,"As far as state-of-the-art computer animation has taken us, ""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius"" isn't first rate, but who said it needed to be, anyway? Here is a movie whose animation reminds us that capturing reality through technology isn't always appealing; for me, this delightful children's movie is a true triumph of comedy and spirited fun, and will no doubt please children as well as adults.
The story is based on the Nickelodeon cartoon featuring Jimmy Neutron, a highly intelligent elementary school student whose knowledge of all things scientific wows his father and displeases his mother (""How many times have we told you not to play with rockets?""). He is teased at school for his height and his creativeness, which sometimes carries mixed results, though none of it seems to bother him. His inventive nature drives him to do things like creating a girl-eating plant, burp soda, and launching a satellite made from a household toaster into space.
When phlegm-like space aliens retrieve the satellite and discover Earth's coordinates, they descend on Jimmy's town and kidnap all adults as a meal for their ruler, a cross between a chicken and Godzilla. At this point, it's up to Jimmy to save the day.
This is a very simple yet entertaining story, devoid of the in-jokes and satirical whimsy of ""Shrek,"" or the slightly more realistic appearance of Disney's ""Toy Story"" movies, yet it still manages to please with its childlike innocence and its wonderful humor. Jimmy's creative mind provides for some very wacky shenanigans, including a completely robotic dog named Goddard who is Jimmy's friend for life. He is also supplied with two best friends, a nerdy, timid chub named Carl, and a cartoon fanatic named Sheen, both of whom bring a great deal of laughs to the material.
The comedy supplied here reminds us that a movie need not be a satire or parody, or possess abundant bodily function jokes or crude humor to be amusing. As for the computer animation, there's no reason I can think of for which ""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius"" should have been supplied with a completely realistic animation process; in fact, when working with the movie's unrealistic story, it adds to the sense of whimsy and fantasy that makes it such a terrific movie.
I expected no more or no less than fun from this latest family feature, and came out with a big smile on my face. Like many of the year's family films, from ""Cats and Dogs"" and ""Spy Kids,"" to ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" this film is pleasing for the kiddies while reminding adults of the pleasures of childhood, and that alone is worth it. That, and the chance to see a Ferris Wheel and an octopus flying through space.",1010102400,15,2681,4.8431372549019605
1692412,1,B000063V14,"After scanning the marque carefully, I decided Jimmy Neutron was the way to go.  No, I'm not a parent, nor a child.  I simply decided that seeing a mindless comedy may be fun.  It was--but only to laugh at.  Jimmy Neutron was a waste of time.  As the director's name flashed on the screen at the end, I jumped out of my seat and made it the first out of the theatre.  Let me tell you why.
Back in the eighties, when I was growing up, we had actual films for us kids--greats including The Neverending Story and Willy Wonka.  These timeless classics entertained and had intelligent gatherings about them.  Jimmy Neutron is a simple chance for a CGI cartoon, but Bugs could fare better.
Many ""subversive"" techniques were used, all cliche, in order to teach children lessons.  Talking to an (extraterrestrial) stranger and sneaking out are what set the movie in turn.  The characters are stupid and potty-based.  Jimmy himself is two dimensional (no pun intended), as he is simply tryin' to have a good time.  His friends are losers who supply comic relief by bragging about peeing in the shower or getting their stomach rubbed by their mom.
While I know that kids aren't hardcore film critics and don't pay careful attention, I felt myself hoping that Jimmy and crew would be depressurized while traveling through space without shelter.  No such luck.  Won't somebody please think of the children?!  ...
Save some money and rent Toy Story again.",1010016000,3,1442,4.712
1692413,4,B000063V14,"I had free passes so I took my 7 year old and 4 year old.  We had not heard anything about it.  Both of my kids were laughing out loud and dancing to the music.  They both loved it!  I enjoyed it too, although it is a kids movie made for kids, not like Shrek, which has more adult humor.  I laughed out loud several times.  I wasn't sure my oldest would like it, but he did.  I would recommend this, just keep in mind it is a silly, fun movie.",1009929600,,443,3.802197802197802
1692414,4,B000063V14,"Just because hes a small kid hasn't stopped Jimmy Neutron from building a rocket ship out of spare parts in his backyard, or a satellite out of a toaster, or a jet pack or a robot dog that plays dead by exploding.  Intending to contact intelligent (and thus benevolent) intergalactic beings, Jimmy breaks the cardinal rule  he talks to strangers (other than policemen).  The aliens  gobs of intelligent goo living in egg-shaped floating canisters (sort of like Daleks) and flying through space in huge battlecrusiers resembling swooping chickens  follow the transmission to Earth where they systematically kidnap all of Retrovilles parents intending to sacrifice them to a huge monster.  At first, the disappearance of the towns adults spurs Jimmy and his friends to turn the town into a pre-teen Utopia  which looks like a cross between an amusement park and a diner (the aliens cover their tracks by leaving identical notes on every refrigerator in town).  A night of carousing, however, leaves the remaining children with bellyaches, and nothing to do with them.  Putting the pieces together, and assembling a ragtag fleet of spaceships using amusement park rides, Jimmy and friends set off for the evil alien homeworld where (surprise) pint-sized ingenuity wins out in the end.
Neutron was great  the atmosphere is perfectly nuanced so its exciting without verging into truly scary, yet entertaining enough for parents.  (My kids, aged 4 and 2 sat through and enjoyed it til the end, never complaining about a thing).  The jokes are light but consistently deliver, the soundtrack keeps things bumping with covers of Kids in America and B by science, and the animation is first rate.  A great family treat.",1009843200,2,1709,5.082437275985663
1692415,4,B000063V14,"Many filmmakers try to make kids movies as entertaining for the parents as for the kids.  Some movies get that just right, like Spy Kids; some movies go a little too far, as Monsters, Inc did in a couple of the scary moments, or Harry Potter did pretty much throughout.
Jimmy Neutron, in contrast, is focused squarely at the kids, and hits its target unerringly.  My daughter was completely engaged from beginning to end.  Even the obligatory scary incarceration scenes were toned to just the right shade; she turned to me and confidently announced that ""the kids are going to win anyway, you know, daddy.""  I was quite relieved.
This is not to say I didn't enjoy the movie.  It's light and entertaining, and some of the visual humor was quite delightful.  The plot is uncomplicated, as the message.  There is some nuance in the interaction between the characters, but even this is painted in primary colors.
As we left the theatre, my daughter was already asking to go back and see it again.  That's a pretty strong endorsement.",1009584000,10,1029,4.709497206703911
1692416,4,B000063V14,"QUALITY: It's no Pixar so Nick didn't go there but the plastic animation of this really cute movie adds to its totally fantastic grounding.  Physics, or reality for that matter, has no place here but bends to the will of the child's imagination.
MORALS: Size doesn't matter, it's all relative and parents usually know what's best, even if they don't seem to know why.
HITS: There's a little sneaking around and adults are shown in a poor light as not altogether coherent (or with-it), especially the teacher and Jimmy's Dad.  This could have been because kids often see adults this way but should not have been perpetuated.
PERKS: I loved Patrick Stewart's voice as the villain, just enough Star Trek with a twist of barbaric megalomania.

I do commend Nickelodeon on wisely firing up the show after this movie's success.  And again...this was a good movie.  Though the concept of all parents disappearing and the kids' initial jubilation and subsequent sadness over the situation has been done before, this movie kept the scenario fresh and entertaining.  While a serious suspension of disbelief is required throughout the film (i.e. just about anything taking place in outer space), it is a kids' film and kids will love it.  I did get a chance to see the computer animation prior to losing my eyesight and I have to admit that's pretty cool, especially given the fact that it was all created with off-the-shelf software.

1692701,5,B000063V14,"There are good and bad things about this movie...mostly good!

In the movie, Jimmy Neutron is a genius, who even though he does all of this cool stuff to help people, others just make of him. One day, Jimmy and his best Friend, Carl Wheezer, launch a teleportation satalite (okay, it is a toaster, but he is a genius!) and it gets found by and alien race called ""The Yolkians"" and they use Jimmy's directions to Retroville, and while all of the kids snuck out to go to the ammusement park ""Retroland"", the Yolkians abduct all of the adults in Retroville. When the kids come back, they figure out their ""No Adult"" dream is now true...but Jimmy later figures out that the adults were stolen. So, Jimmy, with his dog Goddard, and his friends Carl and Sheen Estevez, must lead an army of kids to use ammuesment park rides to get their parents back before they are fed to a giant alien chicken.

So, the movie is good. Okay...the movie is GREAT! It had various lessons in it. ""The Importance Of Family,"" ""Don't Talk To Stranger"" ""You can be helpful, even if you are different (Jimmy has a short size)"" In the show too...Sheen doesn't use the line in this as much: ""Ask Yourselves...WHAT WOULD ULTRALORD DO?""

There is some bad though...like Jimmy is more whiney in this than in the show...and it is actually impossible that all of the parents were on a vacation (I mean, seriously, ""Son/Daughter?"" Butch the Bully could probably of figured something was weird about that, much less a genius like Jimmy.) I also don't like how they act on the ""No Adults Day"" they are moreless being care-free and trashing the town...just think of how mad the adults would've been when they saw the school tee-peed, junk food everywhere, and more ALL OVER THE PLACE!

Besides those few bad things about the movie, this is a movie you should really try out, especially if you like avergage ordinary nerds that no one understands (I know, that is from Fairly OddPparents, but no one DOES understand Jimmy) who can make almost anything...even a ray that plays with size!

You should also really try the show, Jimmy is much less whiney, he makes wackier inventions, and the Sheen lines...where should I begin? :)",1337472000,,2185,4.635658914728682

1692708,2,B000063V14,"In my opinion, the true mark of a good children movie is one that can entertain and speak to children and adults at different levels. This is a movie children will enjoy but not likely grow into discovering grown-up jokes or a more sophisticated understanding of its theme as they mature. It is very much a vapid story within a framework so arbitrary that anything can happen. Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius it's not so much a children movie as it is a children's movie.

I saw this with my daughter when it was first released in theaters and two minutes into it I realized there was just no comparison between it and anything from Pixar or Dreamworks. Prior to the theatrical release Nickelodeon had for months played a number of JN sketches and some were quite funny, but they were all so disjointed I realized after a while they couldn't all possibly be in the movie. And they weren't! This movie was just an attempt to capitalize and promote a show that was going to be on TV.

The voice talents are excellent and the animation is good. The characters themselves are funny (especially the dad and Sheen) and stand out from one another, unlike other shows in which several characters seem to speak with the same voice, both physical and from script. Yet the story line is halting and, even for a kid show, inconsistent, i.e. Jimmy travels around the world (before breakfast) in a rocket he made which is faster than military planes but his family is still middle class and makes no money off his super talent/He is a genius but still attends the same class as non-genius -and downright loopy- kids/He travels through space without a space suit, etc. Fantasy is not the issue, but there has to be consistency within the fantasy; there are ""rules"" even in the most fantastic children fantasy universe that keep the story concordant with itself and not, like in JN, flying off the handle and going wherever it wants to. You'd never see a story so loose from Pixar or Dreamworks.

Eventually, Jimmy Neutron TV episodes went on to be refreshingly original and unusual for a children show (open endings/bad guys winning) but this movie was a letdown, it surprises me the mostly good reviews it has gotten. Whereas I'm just as excited -if not more- than my daughter about whatever new CGI movie is released, with JN I kept glancing at my watch and mentally balancing my check book.

There are worse children movies you can buy, but there are not many of them.",1214697600,,2450,4.625287356321839

1692712,4,B000063V14,"I would like it if everyone took a page from the Tao of Jimmy Neutron, and before you laugh hysterically at the thought of this, I would encourage you to see Boy Genius yourself.  I went into this film expecting childish humor, a mediocre plotline, and animation that would make the boys at South Park seem like they were working at Pixar ... but alas, I was wrong - dead wrong.  Now, I don't want to say that Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius is the best movie I have ever seen, in fact, it is very rare that I deem any film with those words, but it was worth an hour and a half of my time.  What stood out immediately was the animation, the coloring, the bold attention to detail, and the fact that none of it was lost on the DVD.  Occasionally, you find yourself watching an animated film wondering how many drinks the animators may have had while attempting to create artwork, which suddenly becomes even more visible in the comfort of your own home.  There has been, in my time reviewing these films, one film that has been animated flawlessly.  That was The Incredibles, and while Neutron is not that film, the two do stand very well together.  Aside from the standing ovation animation, the rest of the film is actual a fun watch.  Going into this film with no knowledge of the character Jimmy Neutron or his history, I found myself eager to enjoy more of his adventures and further deeper into his world.

One of the enjoyable elements of this film has to be the pacing.  While some will argue that you cannot judge a film by the mere merit of time, for Jimmy Neutron you can.  I didn't want to get bogged down, I didn't want to loose my attention span, and thankfully - with the skilled penmanship of one Steve Oedekerk - I learned to sit back and thoroughly enjoy what Jimmy had to offer.  I wasn't distracted by small, insignificant plot alleys or forgettable characters; with Neutron what you see is what you get.  For approximately 82 minutes we are packed with one exciting element after another without getting sidetracked.  From the opening ""pull"" sequence to the center amusement park transformation, all the way to the final climactic scene which incorporated all the themes and elements from earlier in the film, Neutron honestly didn't let you down.  Strange to hear that coming from a critic that typically goes harsh on the children's films.  For some strange reason, Neutron hooked me and kept a smile on my face during the entire time.  The humor was crisp, the characters were actually enjoyable to watch, and unlike other films of this genre, you knew what was going to happen, but you weren't quite sure how.  I think that is what kept my attention the longest, with the brain power of Neutron; I was never quite sure what he was going to combine next.  The opportunities were endless, and I enjoyed seeing them unfold right before me.  Laugh all you want, but Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius was an enjoyable experience.

Why is it that women can do pre-pubescent boy voices better than anyone else?  Just like in The Simpsons we have a young woman doing the voice behind our heroine with the perfect blend of emotion, excitement, and honesty.  I loved the voices in this film mainly because it didn't focus on trying to give you the ""who is that voice"" quiz game, but rather employ unknowns and allow the film to do the talking.  While I have to give the entire cast excellent marks on their work with this film, it was Patrick Stewart and (I can't believe I am saying this...) Martin Short's comical combination that did it for me.  They aren't big stars, so I didn't hear the voice and immediately see the actor, I saw the Martian counterparts that they were trying to portray!  Coupled with the fact that they looked hysterical (humorous physical depictions of alien life), I found myself laughing at this pair more than I imagined.  Stewart controlled his voice and delivered (with ease) some of the best one-liners of this film, while Short added the final punch needed to make the kiddies in the audience laugh.  For me, the two worked brilliantly together and could honestly carry a show of their own together.  Short wasn't over the top, and the two created a strong balance which coupled well with the seriousness of Neutron's quest.

With all this praise, one would think that this is a perfect film.  Alas, I cannot give it the full five stars, mainly because of an issue of redundancy.  Perhaps that isn't the right word, but what I am trying to say is that this is a show that prides itself on the genius of the main character, Jimmy.  What makes this show work is that he is by far the smartest child on the Earth, yet his parents keep him grounded (which creates likeability for the viewers) by making him do chores, get in trouble, and create boundaries.  Yet, for all the inventions that Jimmy creates, for all the tests that he passes in school, he seems to forget that there is no air in space and therefore the entire plausibility of all the children in his town flying to this obscure planet is debunked.  I realize that this is a cartoon, a-hem, an animated feature and that I should just accept the fact that in this world there is air in space, but I couldn't buy it.  Without the masks or helmets, I felt cheated and was pulled away from the truth, thus forcing me to realize I was watching a film.  Make sense?  I was deeply involved with this film until the kids rallied together and shot into space, because of the fake nature of it.  I couldn't move past it, and was a discouraging element to the film.

Overall, I would strongly suggest this film to families, and in fact, friends.  I thought this was a very funny, very smart, and exceptionally well animated film, especially during the age of Pixar.  The voices were perfect, the pacing (as mentioned before) was a slice of perfection, and the overall molding of this film was nearly flawless.  Outside of the scientific elements that should have been caught (due to the intelligence of our main character), there were moments of pure Oedekerk that made me grin from ear to ear.  Also, if you look closely, there is a great Beetlejuice montage at the beginning and end of the film.  Perhaps it is obscure, but it made me want to watch that classic Keaton film again.  I liked Jimmy Neutron, and while it may get me laughed at on the playground, I thought that for what it was worth, it gave a good 92% -- and that is still an A isn't it?  Check it out - you will be happy!

So I bought the DVD. We still love the slightly cheesy, but very entertaining animation, and the storyline is timeless. Our kids love it, and our adult friends find plenty of inside jokes to keep them happy. A great film for kids.

The only downer is the included music video (not part of the movie) ""Kids in America"" with the old girls dressed like older women who are overcompensating for self esteem issues. It creeps me out to see little girls presented as sex objects. Shades of Jon Benet Ramsey. However, the portrayel is not especially bad by today's standards.

It's a kid-safe bit of amusement, with brilliant Jimmy out to save the parents of the world. The parents have been captured by evil aliens, who look like something lurking in the back of the fridge on last month's leftovers, but with googly eyes. Jimmy and the kids of the world (or at least, his housing tract) save the parents in a bloodless coup.

Wheezy Carl, snooty Cindy, and all the rest create a cast of easily recognized stereotypes. Jimmy's Mom is the one who changes the oil in the family car - cheerful but inept Dad can barely be trusted with the oil in the salad dressing.

That's about as deep as it gets, though. Kids may like the ""kids save the day"" theme, but there's not much here for the adult viewer. One extra star for above-average visual humor.

the animation achieves a fluidity rarely seen in CGI animation and very nearly matches the masters--Warner Brothers and old Disney. The colors are bright and kid friendly, yet the dialogue, allusions and spoofs of everything from teen movies to comic books will entertain adults.
The animators have decided not to tread down the path that Pixar and SKG have gone with Toy Story and Shrek, i.e. the attempt to ""copy"" reality, and have, instead, pursued the outlandish whackiness that cartoons used to be known for. If some have criticized the animation, then they have been comparing apples to oranges.
We have kept our daughter (4 1/2) away from Nickolodeon because we find it generally tasteless, crass and repulsive--thus we were very pleasantly surprised at the result.
The characters are interesting and well drawn and played to the hilt by everyone involved.
One can only hope the inevitable sequels are done with as much verve and cleverness.
A couple of nitpicky items: I agree with the observations of some that Jimmy's father could be more complexly drawn. In this film he is a mere compliment (pun intended) to Jimmy's fiercely brilliant mother. It would also be a good thing for the children if there were a couple of adults (other than his mother) who were a LITTLE smarter than the actual teachers most of us had in school.

Summary:
A great kids movie that is enjoyable for adults as well.  Lots of color, action, silly scenes, and imagination from the kids point of view.
DVD Features:
The DVD has some great features, but lacks Directors' Commentary.  This is a great disappointment only because the movie is very clever. So, it would have been awesome to hear what thoughts went through the Director's mind while making this.
It does provide a number of pre-quels for this movie, as well as a number of promotional short shows for the Jimmy Neutron cartoon that should become a regular feature on Nickelodeon.
Finally, an interesting quick feature with almost all the actors regarding their respective characters and the fun they had making the film.
Review:
James Isaac Neutron - aka Jimmy Neutron is a young genius with a larger than normal head.
His numerous inventions are creative and his mis-adventures with those inventions are entertaining.  - especially his robot dog Goddard, which can transform into anything you can  imagine!  His secret laboratory is more creatively clever and entertaining than Dexter's.
Jimmy contacts and advanced alien civilization for universal peace, only to find they have kidnapped all parents in his town.  So, its up to Jimmy and his friends to construct a fleet of rockets (very childlike rockets) to bring them the alien planet and get their parents back!
Scare Factor:
My kids absolutely loved it (4, 5, 6 years old).  While my son (just turned 4) loved it and was not afraid (my concern for movies with ""bad guys"") I can see how other children may not be so happy about the aliens.
So, go into this great movie with ""optimistic caution"" for the very young.",1032480000,3,1681,4.87719298245614
1692772,4,B000063V14,"Computer animation is poor in this movie but does it really matter?I mean what kind of person would rate a movie on animation?Animation is like a special feature. The animation is not what makes a movie. It's the voice talents and the plot etc that make a movie. That's what I focused on in my veiwing on Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius which is the first computer animation film in the Nick movie seris. Not counting the two Rugrats films this movie was actually all made on the computer. It's not a movie with a bit of adult humor thrown in here and there but the kind of movie that is all for kids just about but parents could enjoy. Adults or parents can enjoy the movie without the extramly brief adult humor unlike Shrek which had alot of it. Why?Because the plot and the idea of it all is interesting. The scene in which the kids make rocket ships from the amusment park to go to space was very interesting and you wouldn't really see that in alot of other films. Basecally the film is good and has alot of great voice talents and evn though I talked about the animation before it is acutally pretty good animation. But what is the movie about is probally the question in your mind. Well then let me begin...
The movie begins in the sky where Jimmy Neutron to trying to send a message to a distant galexy via satllelite that looks alot like a toaster. The message gets through the atomosphere but Jimmy and his best friend Carl Weezer don't make it and fall onto the roof of Jimmy's house. After school that day he learns that that night is the grand opening of a new theme park called Retroland. Too bad it's a school night and Jimmy can't go. Jimmy gets grounded that night also because of an accendent that he had and he Carl and his other friend Sheen decide to sneak out. After having a great time they wish that parents would just go away for a little while. There wish comes true when the aliens from the galexy come to Earth to steal the parents and make them sacrificed to there great Lord. At first the kids are happy with no parents and stay up late and eat way to much candy untill they start to miss them. They then embark on a quest to save their parents from the aliens in an adventure in space.
I know you probally think it sounds corny but you have to see the movie because of the funny jokes that are inside. Such as Sheen's obession with an action figure Ultra Lord which is possible one of the finniest things in the movie. So Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius is worth the bucks to see it. I recommend it to you and most of the other reveiws do too. It's funny and perfect for children....an adults too.

The animation was very cool for its unrealisticness, though they did put great detail into the lighting and eyeballs of the characters (and did it WELL!). Even the soundtrack, a serving of mostly pop songs, wasn't all that bad!
Plot: very simple BUT (and a big 'BUT', I might add (tee hee)) effective! After Jimmy (Derryberry) sends a home-made satellite made out of a toaster into outer space, an egg-like alien race called the Yolkians discover it and decide to use all the parents in Retroville (Jimmy's hometown) as a sacrefice to their god, Poultra (think Godzilla as a chicken and you got it). At first, the kids are happy that their parents are gone (they don't know the whole sacrificing thing yet) and celebrate, but then start to miss them after only a day. So they decide to go on a rescue mission (they know now) to save thier parents from becoming chicken feed.
The humor was very well done, with lots of hidden jokes for the adults. It also reminds adults about childhood.
HOWEVER, I AM unhappy with the way this film was rated. MPAA Rating: G What I Think it Should Be: PG for rude humor and some mild sci-fi action violence.
In case any of you parents are worrying: 1.) I'll tell you what was in the film to warrant a G rating, and 2.) I'll let you know what to look out for: an action scene where the kids are stuck in a meteorite shower, a chase scene involving some gunfire and explosions, some burping, a couple of fart reference jokes, a joke involving Yolkian civilians and Poultra's big butt, a puberty joke, and a joke about girls and hormones.
Remember, the MPAA thought this was mild enough to get a G rating.
Dispite that, everything else was perfect.
So c'mon, I URGE YOU to buy this. Oh, and get it on DVD. There will be plenty of features to keep you busy for a while.
Overall rating: [5] out of [5] stars.",1032307200,,2897,4.66015625

1692812,4,B000063V14,"This movie is very funny and the animation achieves a fluidity rarely seen in CGI animation and very nearly matches the masters--Warner Brothers and old Disney.  The colors are bright and kid friendly, yet the dialogue, allusions and spoofs of everything from teen movies to comic books will entertain adults.
The animators have decided not to tread down the path that Pixar and SKG have gone with Toy Story and Shrek, i.e. the attempt to ""copy"" reality, and have, instead, pursued the outlandish whackiness that cartoons used to be known for.  If some have criticized the animation, then they have been comparing apples to oranges.
I have kept my daughter (2 1/2) away from Nickolodeon because I find it generally tasteless, crass and repulsive--thus I was very pleasantly surprised at the result.
The characters are interesting and well drawn and played to the hilt by everyone involved.
One can only hope the inevitable sequels are done with as much verve and cleverness.
A couple of nitpicky items: I agree with the observations of some that Jimmy's father could be more complexly drawn.  In this film he is a mere compliment to Jimmy's fiercely brilliant mother.  It would also be a good thing for the children if there were a couple of adults (other than his mother) who were stronger role models.  Mrs. Fowl, while funny, comes across as little more than a brain damaged Flo from Alice.
Bottom line: if you're a catroon fan you'll enjoy it as much as your younger children will.  The ""Cool Factor"" will probably prevent ""tweens"" and ""teens"" from admitting they like this movie.",1026000000,,1584,4.869888475836431

1692816,5,B000063V14,"""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius"" (2001)
It is rare that an animated children's film comes along and reminds us exactly how much fun it was to be a kid. Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius is one of those movies that makes you want to go back to those days and play with your gadgets and have fun. Instead of doing that you could just watch this splendid film. It's about as suitable for kids as it is for adults, and I'm sure even though the movie is unrealistic, everyone will view Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius as it was meant to be viewed - a fun-filled, imaginative and faithful adaptation to the TV show I have not yet seen.
The movie's plot is fairly simple - some kids' parents are kidnapped by aliens so its up to the children to save the day - but the wizardry is not in the plot. The real fantastical thing about the movie is the fact that Jimmy Neutron is a boy-genius and this offers for some terrific belly laughs. The fact that this young child can invent things that children and even some adults can only dream about is brilliant and it brings the movie vividly to life. Jimmy can invent edible bubble-gum which blows up to be a type of transport, burp soda, a mechanical dog named Goddard, a plant which is robotically engineered to eat girls, and many other things. Neutron's inventions are what save the day in the end and they are memorably creative and you'll wish you had some of the things that Jimmy could invent.
The film's humour is absolutely stunning. You've got the chance to see a giant octopus and rollercoaster ride in space, see Channel 7 news run by children and the characters themselves bring many smiles and laughs to the movie. Jimmy Neutron is a funny man himself, very scientific and uses a lot of big words and metaphorical slangs (funny since he is so young), but it isn't him that steals the show. For me, the sidekicks really steal the show which is so often the case in many comedies. Carl is Jimmy's best friend, a glasses-wearing, chubby and thick guy, and he has the coolest voice and I just thought his lines and character in general were very cute. For the kids Sheen will be terrific. His obsession with a cartoon character Ultra Lord offers many belly laughs. And then of course there's Goddard, Neutron's mechanical dog, who has many gadgets and insertions, and he ultimately takes the cake and is the most inventive (and that's out of a lot) thing in the film.
Sure, the movie does have a couple of problems. There are still some questions you'll want answered like I wondered if the parents were only abducted from Jimmy's home town or from all over the world. And how could the children just ""breathe"" in space? But of course you've got to remember this movie is mostly intended to be seen by children so those 2 are excusable in some senses. What disappointed me slightly is that the movie is really quite predictable overall. The gadgets and ideas in the movie are indescriably entertaining and you don't expect them, but the plot doesn't have any major twists and turns and you just know how the movie is going to end. I also wanted to see more of Jimmy's class teacher, who is the funniest character in the entire film and has yet 2 scenes.
However, what remains of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius is a terrific animated movie with great memorable quotes and some amazing ideas. It is worth seeing in the theatres for its creative genius and great photography. Highly recommended!

1692839,1,B000063V14,"Jimmy Neutron may be a genius, but the people who made this movie sure aren't. This movie had never appealed to me, but I got free tickets to a sneak preview of it, and since I had nothing to do on the night of preview, I decided to go to it. How I wish I hadn't. One of the main problems with the film is the type of animation they decided to use. It reminded me of animation that's in several computer games, especially ""SimTheme Park"". Sure, it would have suited a half-an-hour cartoon show, but not a full length movie! The characters are dull and unfunny. Jimmy Neutron, the title character, is cute at first, but then becomes annoying. Very annoying. The story itself is unoriginal and, well, lame. A boy genius who gets himself into many little adventures. Half the shows on The Cartoon Network are already about that! Young children may find it entertaining, but it's going to be an absolute pain for their parents to sit through. I wanted to walk out of the theater in the first 20 minutes of the film, but since my 5-year-old niece (who I took to the screening with me) seemed to be enjoying herself, I decided not to. But it turns out that she didn't enjoy it that much at all! When I asked her how she liked it she responded: ""It was OK."" Why was this film nominated for an Oscar?
