Between the music, the motion and the meaning of the pieces I could not take my eyes off the screen.  I have already recommended this work to several friends and I have given two copies as gifts as well.  There is nothing like it!",1155081600,5,374,4.225352112676056
8600947,5,B000H2NHME,"DREAM SHADOWS ""evolution"" is a 25-minute multimedia film that illustrates and interprets poems through music and photography. This unique and ultimately captivating compilation of poems is ingenious, as well as entertaining and educational for anyone interested in poetry, digital photography and editing, and inventive ways to merge these elements. The film consists of 14 individual poems, by poet Jim Way, that explore a common theme of personal voyages and are visually linked through 12 original photographs taken by Joe Watring.

While many of the poems will be unknown to viewers, the language and dominant theme in the story are sure to be familiar to many people who seek physical and spiritual journeys. The most interesting part of the film is the pairing of photographs to each poem. The combination of these components is harmonious, facilitating an intriguing way to explore and experience poetry. Text scrolls along each page allowing the reader to keep pace with the exact tempo of each poem. Not only does this help the reader to follow along, but it establishes the right beats per rhythmic measure. The ease with which the music, photography, and poems blend together helps to create the overall feeling of being on a journey, and it is difficult to imagine that the digital editing and transitioning of the photographs is largely responsible.

DREAM SHADOWS ""evolution"" is an interesting film and Joe Watring is an avant-garde photographer who has successfully dramatized Way's poems in his multimedia DVD. This film would be an invaluable tool in the classroom. Many students look at poetry with trepidation. This method of combining poems, photos, and music into a film presents poetry in a way that is engaging for many students who might otherwise be intimidated by it. Not only is this a way to explore poetry but it is also a new way to implement technologies into the learning environment.",1155081600,4,1916,5.118210862619808
