8058732,5,B0009A5KLU,"""iParenting Media Awards Reviewers"" stated the following:

The interaction outside was especially appealing to my son. He was excited to actually see the kids run around outside. He's familiar with soccer balls and was excited to see them and learn more. I think this is a good, basic tool for teaching kids about soccer.

The positive characteristics of this DVD was that it used the character Jimmy Sport. The children became more interested once he appeared. I liked how the DVD shows how sports can be made fun.

This is a great DVD for kids who already have an interest in soccer and to spark an interest in those that don't. The setting, situations and dialogue seemed very believable. The addition of Jimmy Sport makes this different from most sport-related instructional videos. Teamwork is emphasized, as well as basic skills and exercise.",1141430400,3,848,4.957746478873239
