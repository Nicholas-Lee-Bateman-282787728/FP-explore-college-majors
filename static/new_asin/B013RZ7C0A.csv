8728655,3,B013RZ7C0A,"A FEEL GOOD MOVIE, BUT I FAST-FORWARDED THROUGH MOST OF IT. LORENZO PLAYED A VERY NARROW-MINDED, GODLESS CHARACTER. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE STAR. NO ACTION.",1501027200,,156,5.038461538461538
8728656,1,B013RZ7C0A,"Like other viewers, I wish I hadn't wasted my hard earned money on this movie.  Don't buy! Horrible acting, story could have been a lot better, looks like it was filmed back in the 80's and with a video camera",1447459200,,209,4.225
8728657,1,B013RZ7C0A,"Welcome to the wonderland of bad Christmas Movies...Take a hackneyed plot, add in semi-competent actors when have given up once they read the script, market it as heartwarming Christmas saga and viola: you have  A LITTLE CHRISTMAS BUSINESS. But as the title suggests, this will generate a little business but not much. This makes even the sappiest Hallmark films (there are MANY really good ones) look decent. Avoid at all costs!",1447113600,,429,5.042253521126761
8728658,2,B013RZ7C0A,"Love the Baldwin boys-but, this is a very low budget movie. Very hard to follow; Daniel Baldwin is sent to gather signatures from different offices per his boss( what a 1st class HORRIBLE actor) and as Don Collier ( Daniel Baldwin) goes upstairs to the 1st office it appears he is having a heart attack?? falls and I suppose is transported to his past life.. A little unclear what's happening, also, he has taken his 10 year old son with him, leaves him in the car and we are left wondering about the son as it seems he is forgotten while Don is meeting with people fro his past and goes to lunch. Sorry- but at this point I turned off the DVD. Just seemed to drag out a confusing plot that I just wasn't that interested in making a effort to sort out.",1446681600,,752,4.229166666666667
8728659,2,B013RZ7C0A,"I wanted to like this movie, even though I knew the storyline was going to be a mostly predictable ""Ghosts of Christmases Past"" type of thing.  But the movie just dragged, there were no subtitles or closed captioning, and the sound quality wasn't very good, which made me stop it halfway through and donate it.",1446336000,2,310,4.636363636363637
8728660,4,B013RZ7C0A,"A VERY quick 69-minutes. It's more of a QUIT YOUR JOB IF IT SUCKS
movie than a Christmas movie. The actors were ALL capable. There's
a slide show with a very pretty Christmas song, director's commentary,
previews, etcetera.
I once had a VERY good paying job... with a boss I hated. She wanted me
to come to work an hour earlier [before the first 180MPH BULLET-TRAIN]
left my small German town for the 22-minute ride. Driving my car would've
taken FOUR TIMES that long... when it wasn't snowing. I'll never forget our
last words:
SHE: ""So, you cannot d-r-i-v-e to work every day, and get here before 07:00?""
ME : ""I could, but, WON'T.""
SHE: ""You won't get a $20-an-hour GOVERNMENT job anywhere NEAR here!""
ME : ""I'll start working for $6-an-hour, tomorrow at the PX. Good-bye!""
It took 13-years to get up to $15-an-hour... not VERY close to what I was making,
but life is TOO short to be MISERABLE... and/or spend most of your day on-the-road,
and at a job you don't enjoy anymore.

I deducted one star because the [dialogue ]SOUND could have been a bit better.",1446076800,2,1060,4.578947368421052
