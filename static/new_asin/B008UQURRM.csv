5183564,4,B008UQURRM,"There isn't really any new material on this DVD (which shouldn't surprise anyone) - but it is a one stop shop for many of the best moment of RvB.  If you enjoy RvB, you'll enjoy the DVD.  If you don't enjoy RvB, why are you reading this?",1353715200,7,237,4.0212765957446805
5183565,5,B008UQURRM,"I finished watching this DVD a few days ago, and it's kept me laughing the entire time. It is presented in a hilarious awards-show format, with different characters presenting the different awards. The antics of Sarge, Sister, Church, Caboose, and many others keep it funny, while also paying tribute to the epic moments of this spectacular series. So go ahead and pick this up, it's a steal for just $5. And remember, memory is the key.",1352592000,,437,4.7631578947368425

5183567,5,B008UQURRM,"In my opinion, a one of a kind Dvd that a RVB owner must own!

Its the Red Vs Blue Awards show introducing everyone including Sister,
Andy, and someone from the Grifball mini series. This Dvd shows all sorts of stuff like favorite quotes, favorite characters, and other moments from the past.

It also has new content that makes the whole thing complete, and why not get it, 5 bucks!??? THATS A STEAL!

Get it now...

5183588,5,B008UQURRM,"This is a good movie about how the Red VS Blue tv show gets rewards for stuff like best villains, best friends of all time and more. This movie is amazing. I wish Rooster Teeth would come out with a Blu-Ray. The movie is great.",1408406400,,227,4.066666666666666
5183589,5,B008UQURRM,My only regret is that in a few years I will be forced to buy the collectors edition because it will have even more of this stuff.,1402963200,,130,3.8518518518518516
5183590,2,B008UQURRM,"Bought this for a 10 year old thinking it was a comedic movie about the Halo teams, but, it contained a lot of bad language and we turned it off within the first 5 minutes. Maybe okay for older viewers.",1396224000,,202,4.075
5183591,5,B008UQURRM,"I must be honest. At 63 years old, this is not my kind of movie. That being said, I bought it as a gift for my grandson.
 I gave the DVD a five star rating based on his reaction to it. He enjoyed it, was very happy with it. And when you can get a 19 year old to admit liking anything, you have got a winner.",1391817600,10,307,3.582089552238806

5183595,5,B008UQURRM,I am a HUGE RvB fan (even though I don't play Halo).  LOL.  This DVD is presented as if it were an awards ceremony and has the best of clips - and they really are the best of!  The DVD is a must have for your RvB collection if you're a fan.,1377216000,4,240,3.576923076923077

5183598,5,B008UQURRM,Roosterteeth did an awesome job with this one. Love the whole set up and how they had added in the mini series: Relocated for easier viewing and I just love these guys and how well they've been doing with the series~ :D,1370044800,2,219,4.238095238095238

5183601,5,B008UQURRM,This DVD binds together all the best moments of the Red VS Blue Trilogy. It was great because although I had seen those moments a hundred times it was great. This DVD is a must get for all Roost Teeth fans,1367798400,,205,4.024390243902439

5183603,3,B008UQURRM,"A best of reel with the premise of an awards show.

Kind of never gets going. Most episodes by themselves are funnier.",1366502400,,118,4.363636363636363
5183604,5,B008UQURRM,"Having followed the series for the last six years, I seem to have forgotten some of the absolutely comical gems that can be found within the episodes. If you, like me, are a fanboy to the core for the Red and Blue teams, this bonus disk is definitely for you! Presented as an awards show, this ""best of"" disk will have you rolling on the ground from start to finish. Guaranteed. Well, guaranteed if you have a pulse and the capacity to roll on the ground while laughing.",1366243200,,470,4.3522727272727275
5183605,2,B008UQURRM,I expected an entertaining feature. It is just a mish mash of old clips with narration. I don't understand how it's the best RVB DVD of all time.,1364428800,,145,4.214285714285714
5183606,5,B008UQURRM,"I picked this up for a friend who had heard of the series, but never watched any of the episodes. This is a fun intro to the series, and will help you get to know the characters. There are spoilers in the program is you have not see all of the seasons, but with a show like this it does not affect much. If you want to avoid spoilers start with the Blood Gulch DVDs instead. If you enjoy Robot Chicken type of humor this is for you!",1359936000,,432,3.9204545454545454
5183607,5,B008UQURRM,This is great. If you don't like RvB don't even bother. But if you are a fan then buy it and donate to the cause.,1358294400,3,113,3.56
5183608,4,B008UQURRM,"I like how this DVD has a Grammy/Oscar award feel to the RedvsBlue series,  But the amount of footage offered is much to short for my taste, it was nice to see the highlights from past seasons and episodes, But I own all the DVDs so it wouldn't have been that hard to watch them over again. All in all I think this is a great DVD, especially four only $5? Yeah totally worth it.",1358035200,,378,4.04
5183609,4,B008UQURRM,2 Easter eggs and they are only in one place. The dvd is just for the show its self and not the features at all... and we know Rooster Teeth for their amazing DVD extras... Said best RVB DVD ever but it's like 4rth. Now why I know it was so cheap... So.. Buy a bunch and give them to your friends!,1357948800,,297,3.806451612903226
5183610,5,B008UQURRM,"The Rooster Teeth team should hit Hollywood.  My teenage son started watching them a few years back.  I was never big into Halo but being the involved dad that I am, I figured I'd give it an honest try and watch a few episodes of Red vs Blue.  I am so glad I did.  They create great story lines and the comedic banter between the characters is the best I've seen.  They put network TV to shame!

I got this for my kid for Christmas and we have watched it several times now.  Their choice for Best Music was off...I thought the track for Tex Returns when she kicks everyone's butt in that warehouse was better...but that's just me being picky.

Get this DVD if you like RvB...BUT if you haven't seen RvB yet, get the Season DVDs first, otherwise you will just be lost.",1357516800,,767,4.241379310344827
5183611,5,B008UQURRM,"Good movie.  Buy it.  Also arrived in good condition and all that.  Is it a clip show? Yes, but it does have about 50% new material and the clips are the best.",1357430400,,159,3.90625
5183612,4,B008UQURRM,This was a xmas present for my son. i'm not into Halo & red vs blue but he loved it.,1357257600,,84,3.25
5183613,5,B008UQURRM,"Sup, Shisnos? They already released all 10 seasons on DVD. You may be asking yourself, ""Why is it here?""

I already own all 10 seasons that are out now, but I bought it anyway. Only half of it is reruns, and a few things from the show are re-edited, like a Meta/Agent Maine epicness montage. Even though I've seen every season at least 3 times, I laughed like I was seeing the clips for the first time. However, very few clips from Season 9 made it in, and only one from season 10.

The award ceremony scenes between clips are nothing short of hilarious, especially if you know the series as well as I do. If you don't know the series, it's a good way to get hooked, and it's only $5. Come on. Plus, it includes the obscure Grifball miniseries ""Expansion"" exclusive to Halo Waypoint and the Recollection DVD set from RoosterTeeth (Amazon and Best Buy versions don't have it).

Anyway, it's a great way to introduce friends to the show, it's great if you have some or none of the DVDs, and it's great for die-hard fans like me. Buy it. And pick up some elbow grease and headlight fluid while you're at it.",1357171200,14,1104,4.349514563106796
5183614,5,B008UQURRM,This DVD highlights some really great moments in the series and really shows how the show has developed since its humble beginnings. This is a must have.,1356307200,,153,4.703703703703703
5183615,5,B008UQURRM,The DVD is very much so worth it (It's $5!). All of the scenes selected were excellent and chosen by RvB viewers. A must have for an RvB fan.,1356048000,,141,3.896551724137931
5183616,5,B008UQURRM,"This was five stars for me, just a fantastic trip down memory lane. I really enjoyed watching this.

Over the next few months, I'm sure I'll leave it on playing a few times while I'm cleaning house and such.

Red vs Blue has always been so much fun for me.",1355875200,,256,4.1
5183617,5,B008UQURRM,This DVD is a fun filled disc compiled by the best of RvB seasons 1-9 hand picked by the fans for the fans,1355356800,,106,3.652173913043478

8530610,5,B008UQURRM,"Son a huge fan n even had me watching some of em. He pretty happy with the video, he already had several seasons but this was a good ""don't have all day but want to watch some good episodes"" DVD.
Arrived super fast and in great shape. Thanks amazon",1480896000,,248,4.081632653061225
8530611,2,B008UQURRM,"Welllll, I may be guilty of judging a DVD by it's first few minutes and I will go back and watch more BUT This seems about as funny as MST3K so it's probably better with ethanol and since I take warfarin, I am not allowed to indulge.

When I give it another try, maybe by skipping around through the disk, I may update this if I find it better than 'dismal'.

Sorry fans. I guess I just don' get it.
