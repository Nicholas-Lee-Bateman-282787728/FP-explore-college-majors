5962479,5,B00F0SLHBI,"A signed copy of this timeless treasure.
I have been looking for Success for years!",1414108800,,83,4.6
5962480,5,B00F0SLHBI,"A very clever movie.  Jeff Bridges plays a man who works for his overbearing father-in-law and whose wife treats him more like a pet than a husband.  One day he becomes fed up and devises a plan that will not only let him get even, but ahead.  It involves him impersonating himself.",1406851200,2,282,4.384615384615385
5962481,5,B00F0SLHBI,"I was looking for years for this film on DVD . It's practically out of print
Yet , when it  I saw it available on Amazon , I jumped at the chance ... And it paid off . Great movie ( and on DVD  )",1392422400,,195,3.311111111111111
8611199,3,B00F0SLHBI,"silly romantic comedy about a milquetoast husband who turns into a risque lover for the spoiled brat daughter of a credit card typhoon.  Contradictory that it treats a stolen ""five million dollars"" as adequate for the portrayed concluding lifestyle.",1521504000,,249,5.384615384615385
8611200,5,B00F0SLHBI,Wonderful!  I loved this movie.  A hilarious presentation of a relationship.  If only I could give it 6 stars.,1520812800,,110,4.684210526315789
8611201,5,B00F0SLHBI,"I have always really liked this movie and I streamed it from Amazon Prime last night. I have an old VHS of The American Success Company which I haven't watched in awhile. I do not recall that there was a narration in the original, which I think detracts from the film. The plot as it unfolds is easily understood without having it explained throughout by a voice-over of what Harry is thinking. Still, it's a clever and funny movie.",1518912000,,432,4.481012658227848
8611202,1,B00F0SLHBI,"This film is a glimpse of everything that was seriously screwed up in the 80s. Toxic masculinity, infantilized women and that is just scratching the surface. There are glimpses of humor thrown in but not enough to prevent the cringeworthy issues with the lionshare of the screenplay. Its a miracle I did not go blind watching or listening to this. It will take forever to get the stench of this film off me.",1518048000,,407,4.589041095890411
8611203,1,B00F0SLHBI,"not worth watching ,the wife was a real bimbo that loved herself",1517529600,,64,4.416666666666667
8611204,5,B00F0SLHBI,"Loved this wonderful movie about the fantasy world of a man who marries daughter of a wealthy banker. He plays dual roles of his own character. A young Jeff Bridges pulls off his role/roles effectively and truly makes it a huge success. Highly recommended, but the movie needs to be touched up a bit for sound effects and setting.",1517184000,,330,4.610169491525424
8611205,5,B00F0SLHBI,"I have loved this movie for decades and always wanted a copy. At last I have it. It went straight into the DVD player quality is good for an 80's movie and a disk that is not ""mass produced"". The signed copy was unexpected for me and struck me as cool. I originally saw "" The American Success Co."" version, as I remember it being called, on HBO(?) as a kid about 1980. I cannot recommend this film enough. Super fun to watch and surely one of Bridges best performances ever. Love the story.",1497571200,,490,4.223404255319149
8611206,4,B00F0SLHBI,"I have not purchased the DVD because it is now (2017) unavailable. I remember seeing two different versions of this extremely entertaining film on a cable TV movie channel circa 1980 or 1981, and for a while I had a bootleg VHS copy of the longer, more complete cut.  The shorter version made no sense whatsoever.  The possibly apocryphal story behind this film  is that during one or more of the numerous production shut-downs for William Richert's other film (Winter Kills), Richert had cast members Jeff Bridges and Belinda Bauer (a former supermodel with the Zoli agency) available, and Richert cobbled together the script and scrounged to get this film made in Europe during the time available. Bridges is very good as the boss's son-in-law out of his depth (""The kitchen. Where is it?!""); Bauer gives a wonderfully loopy performance as his spoiled wife (""I'm a snow bunny""), and there are bizarre but effective turns by John Glover and Ned Beatty.  I'd love to have a decent transfer of a complete cut of this movie.",1494720000,,1022,4.822857142857143
8611207,3,B00F0SLHBI,Bought this movie because of the house where they filmed was art deco decor  The sound is not the greatest but fun movie.  Wish someone would do a remake.  I don't remember movie being so grainy and sound so off.  Probably would not have ordered movie knowing what I know now. It was a little pricey.  The memory of the movie would have been better.  Yet I am glad I found the movie.,1432512000,3,383,4.178082191780822
8611208,5,B00F0SLHBI,"Hilarious.  One of my favorite comedies, with incredible performances from Ned Beatty, Belinda Bauer, and especially Jeff Bridges.",1423526400,,130,6.222222222222222
