8120460,1,B000FBTZ1O,This was not what I expected! I thought it was gonna be more informative. It felt like the whole DVD was like the introduction of a big book so you're left sitting down waiting for a lot more! Anyways it's my personal opinion!!!,1327708800,,228,4.325581395348837
8120461,1,B000FBTZ1O,"I had to purchase this for a class. This is among the worst documentary shorts I have seen. Yanomami: Straddling Two Worlds is monotonously narrated, poorly paced, abominable quality, and worst of all: overpriced. Whoever sells this video is obviously in cahoots with my professor in an educational supplement scam: $9.99 times 30 students times four semesters per year comes out to $1,198.80, and that's just for one professor. Amazon Instant Video is the only place on the internet where this video is available, and believe me, nobody is thankful for this monopoly. I have bought DVDs for cheaper than this. In fact, I wish I watched one of those DVDs instead of this.",1313712000,,671,4.894736842105263

8120463,3,B000FBTZ1O,"As a producer of videos on Amazonian Indians, I am keenly interested in other videos of Amazon tribes.  This video brings up some good points about native societies, but lacks spectacular images of indigenous people that I was seeking.",1157414400,6,235,5.0256410256410255
