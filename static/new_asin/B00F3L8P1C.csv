If you loved this show as a kid, buy it before its sold out. If you never liked it , than give Superhuman Samurai Syber Squade a chance.",1381622400,5,372,4.405797101449275

I'm already halfway throught he series & I can't wait to finish it. If you're a bit of a nerd & want to geek out for awhile, then this is the show for you.",1381449600,4,283,3.8135593220338984
5966560,5,B00F3L8P1C,"I have kept tabs on this show ever since it aired on tv. I hadn't looked up any information on it in a couple of months, but this morning I received a shock when I typed Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters From Beverly Hills into Yahoo. It was to be released on dvd this very morning, October 1st, 2013! Needless to say, I ordered it without a second thought. When I receive it, I promise to give in depth reviews on each episode. Scoop this one up, you won't be sorry!",1380585600,,465,4.177777777777778
5966561,2,B00F3L8P1C,"I watched this show back when it was on TV and well, this is bad, badly acted, effects that look like 60s/70s Dr Who.  If you want to prove that there is effort in Power Rangers along side the knock offs, just show them this for what it takes to not put in effort... it's allmost like they put effort into not putting effort into the show.

Ok, so why did I give this two starts, that's just personal prefence as for as bad as this is, I just like goofy things like this... at least a little.",1379376000,4,492,4.010204081632653

5966564,3,B00F3L8P1C,"One of the better Power Rangers rip-offs.  It doesn't hold up as well as I had hoped, but it's still a fun little romp if you like that genre.",1442102400,2,142,3.896551724137931
5966565,5,B00F3L8P1C,I watched this show before school. It's bad. Realllly buddy. But I bought it to remember how bad it was. It makes Power Rangers look really good. Do not buy this expecting a god show. Buy this to remember how bad it is.,1433116800,,219,4.116279069767442

5966569,5,B00F3L8P1C,Loved the show on tv except the replay of a few episodes over and over. Having the complete series allowed me to see every episode.,1412726400,,131,4.28
5966570,3,B00F3L8P1C,A nostalgic trip through one of the super sentai shows of the 90's. The special effect aren't very good. The writing is very 90's and very cliche. But if you watched this show in the 90 and and you want a trip down memory lane you can beat it at this price.,1409011200,3,257,3.9615384615384617

5966573,5,B00F3L8P1C,"It's practically Power Rangers done right. I say this because they're a bit more realistic because the characters don't really like each other, yet they fight together against evil aliens. Power Rangers on the other hand were too friendly to each other, which makes it seem less realistic when it comes to personality and behavior. My only gripe is the title of the show, which is way too long. I mean come on? Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills? I would have shorten it to Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters, or just Alien Fighters. Anyways I enjoyed this show when I was a kid. I'm sure people will love this too.",1404259200,,628,4.666666666666667

5966575,5,B00F3L8P1C,"It's an understatement to say that this show is frowned upon by Ranger fans and toku lovers everywhere for being too low budget and cheesy (which is saying quite a lot). But come on. It's supposed to be.

Once you look past the production value, you'll see a very well-written series that is much more of a satire/spoof on the Power Rangers than any of its other imitators. It has such an awareness about it and treats its characters like real people that have real emotions and real motivations. At the time this aired on the USA Network, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, although very exciting and explosive to watch, did not those kinds of things. Yes, the Power Rangers themselves had basic character tropes that you could feel and legendary screen presence, but their characters were always somewhat two-dimensional and Pollyanna-esque. The Tattooed Teenagers, on the other hand, were not this way. They were sarcastic, pessimistic, sassy, snarky, and didn't always get along with one another. They even questioned what their heroic duties multiple times throughout the show's run and even tried to quit more than once.

This is what makes Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills so fresh in comparison. It wouldn't be until ten years later during the Disney era of Power Rangers that its writers would even try to be bold enough to attempt to portray that franchise's heroes that way. In that sense, TTAF is a pioneer and truly ahead of its time.

Don't be surprised when this show airs on something like Adult Swim in the next few years. It's a great piece of camp - a parody that is severely misunderstood. Don't take it seriously. It wasn't meant to be viewed that way.",1402272000,5,1686,4.8068965517241375
5966576,5,B00F3L8P1C,"This show is 20 years old. 1994-2014 still love this show. the music, fight, and the dialogue, this show is cheesy at it's best. takes me back to 1994. good times!  :-)",1398124800,,168,4.25
5966577,5,B00F3L8P1C,I know this show was trying to be another wannabe power ranger show but it was something different and their symbols are actually signs of the horoscope.,1392336000,,153,4.703703703703703
5966578,5,B00F3L8P1C,"I'm not ashamed to say that I watched this show when it first appeared on the USA Network back in the mid 90's, and that I taped the majority of the episodes. It recently reappeared on the local THIS Channel in Connecticut and my kids saw it. My youngest son, a converted sci-fi fan, fell in love with it. When I found out that the complete series was available on DVD, I had to have it!! Watching the episodes (without commercial interruption), I come to appreciate it even more. It's not exactly the Power Rangers (which I also have on DVD), the special effects are not top-notch Daikaiju style, but the series has its own special appeal, particularly the actors playing the four kids, as well as those playing their Galactic Sentinel counterparts. This series is not only watchable, but re-watchable, and enjoyable.....but completely underrated. But, it's sci-fi. It's not really good sci-fi, it's not really bad sci-fi, but like all sci-fi, you have to dispel reality in order to enjoy it. So, take a chance and enjoy!!!",1391126400,,1024,4.758426966292135
5966579,5,B00F3L8P1C,"This show was super cheesy to me as a kid and that still holds true today.  But that was what made this show so much fun, and still does!.  A great, action packed show that never takes itself too seriously and just has fun riffing on the Power Rangers and Kaiju films we all know and love.",1388534400,,289,4.052631578947368
5966580,5,B00F3L8P1C,Great buy Love it. Brings me back to my childhood. A Plus Highly recommended to any one. If you like power rangers this is for you.,1386288000,2,131,4.076923076923077
5966581,5,B00F3L8P1C,"It's funny how many people rate this show poorly calling it a cheap Power Rangers knockoff. I don't think they get the point of the show. It's clearly a spoof on all the shows that tried to cash in on the Power Rangers craze and it's clear that's the case when the show makes a point to pick fun at the many tropes of the genre, such as the way villains send one monster per episode and don't just send all their monsters at once, or why of all people the good guy with indistinguishable characteristics a la Zordon picks teenagers of all people to fight crime. There are some pretty funny ideas in this episode, and it's obvious that these guys know it's a parody of the genre. The battles are the most hilarious part of all due to how bad the special effects are. There's an episode where the bad guy Gorganus sends his monster Octodroid to pollute all the Earth's fresh water with salt water and the monster proceeds to stomp around and make gurgling noises for a bit before lighting a couple trees on fire with an energy ray from its mouth. The explosions are all very tame and the whole time you can't help but think why these monsters are such a threat. Then there's the superheroes that transform into Galactic Sentinels, who are bodybuilders with bulging muscles in latex costumes. Most of the fighting consists of jumping around and acrobatics before some blasts with their energy weapons and joining together to form Knightron before defeating the monster. It's all very silly butt very funny. This is a great show to put on and laugh at for comedy value, plus it has great eye candy in Leslie Danon, the girl who plays Lori Foster.",1382054400,12,1642,4.494983277591973

8612055,4,B00F3L8P1C,"A cheap cash-in of the Americanized tokusatsu era, TTAFFBH manages to turn the genre on its head by having hilarious, self-aware dialogue and oddly endearing moments that put the spotlight on the absurdity inherent to tokusatsu,but still manages to be fun and exciting in its own way.",1511049600,,284,5.0638297872340425
