8235430,5,B000ZH88WA,"This TV series deals with the ""true"" story of a geek who comes to the aid of a woman that he sees being mauled by a drunk abroad a subway train.  The woman thanks the geek by sending him a pair of tea cups.  Through the chat forum that the geek participates in, the members provide encouragement and advice on how to pursue the lady.  The geek has to go through several crises in trying to befriend the lady.  The TV series consisted of 11 episodes.  The subtitle work of this DVD set is spotty in some areas since it was not done professionally.  Often, you don't see the English translation at all while a character continues to speak Japanese. The main male character does come off a bit too ""over the top"" in some of the acting.  I think the chat members are one of the strongest points in this series.  Their reactions and advice that they give the geek are hilarious at times.  This is an entertaining series with good plot flow with a good emotional storyline.

This two DVD set is in NTSC with no region coding so it is playable on USA players.  The main menu does not have any subtitle setting.  You have to use the player remote button to change the subtitles (from none to Chinese, English, or Japanese).  I tried to play this DVD on a Blu-ray player, but wasn't able to access the subtitle change option using the Blu-ray remote.  I was able to access it on a standard DVD remote.

This set has the 11 TV episodes plus the first special episode (Train Man vs. Guitar Man) after the series ended (there was a second special episode, but that is not included in this set).  It also contains the movie version as well (which has a different cast).  That is why you see all four central cast members on the front photo of the DVD set (two from the movie and two from the TV show).  Personally, the TV series was better for me.  Better plot development, better supporting cast, and a more attractive heroine.  The series has lots of laughs and tears.  Enjoy.",1294358400,,1965,4.358126721763085
8235431,5,B000ZH88WA,"The TV version has 11 episodes and this story is so good and the cast is so perfect that we found it difficult to not watch the next episode even though it was time for sleep. Couldn't wait to get home from work to watch the next few episodes. I laughed out loud, I cried due to the sincerity of the acting, and I cheered also. This is the best dvd purchase that I have ever made in my life. If you love Japan and Japanese things, then you simply must see this.",1239062400,4,461,3.967741935483871
8235432,5,B000ZH88WA,"While the Movie version of Densha Otoko was licensed and distributed in the US, the TV series never was.  This an unlicensed DVD.  The Subtitles are spotty and even say at points that if you paid for the DVD someone is ripping you off.  (An obvious sign that they stole the translation from the an internet FanSub).  This is not a legal import version.",1230336000,9,352,4.453125
8235433,5,B000ZH88WA,"Train Man is about a geek who ends up saving a lovely woman from a drunk on the train.  The geek thinks that's it, you know, what else is going to happen?  Well, when the girl sends him a gift as a thank you and it turns out to be a costly gift.  So he decides to go for it, to ask her out on a dinner, to make up for her spending so much on a gift. And he does it, he asks her out.  Oh, the horror, the sweating horror, as a geek goes from living in his room to going out and having a life.  I have the manga, the movie and even the novel but I had to get the TV series.  Why?  The lovely, the funny, the sexy, the great Japanese actress, the one and only Ito Misaki.  She can do any part and she always does them well.  In this series she plays the older woman who is smart if sometimes clueless, mature, tastefully and truly a woman who seems to be on a pillar.  The kind of woman in real life many guys will not even try to get into a relationship with.  She is just too good for us.
Over 540 minutes, funny, touching, but it sometimes feels a tad slow.  Maybe because I knew the story already or maybe because it is a TV series and they had filler to spread it out over so many episodes.
