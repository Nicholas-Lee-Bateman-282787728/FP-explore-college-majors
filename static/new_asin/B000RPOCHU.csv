It is a limp,ineffective attempt to cash in on a current movie. Dont waste your money on it.",1211155200,2,213,4.325
2874659,4,B000RPOCHU,"A good production on the plot to kill Jesse James. A deeper insight on Robert Ford and his desire and ambitions to be a member of the James gang.
His disappointments concerning his role in the gang that eventually led to the plot and it's consequences.",1199491200,4,252,4.5

8202238,2,B000RPOCHU,"Mostly of Bob Ford, Jesse's Killer. Did not enjoy at all.  Had high expectations from a History Channel presentation.  Something that I would highly recommend , by PBS, is ""Jesse James Deal or Alive"". Excellent !!  If you like things along this subject material, PBS, ""Wild West"". Has an awesome View of Jesse James.  I bought the separate DVD ""Jesse James-wanted Dead or Alive"".  Excellent !!  On that DVD was advertised the ""Wild West"".  This has the same Jesse James just described, Plus, Billy the Kid, Butch Cassidy, George Custer, and Wyatt Earp.  Highly recommended !!  PBS explains the story and puts you right there with them.  Get it and enjoy !",1456012800,,655,4.767857142857143

8202242,5,B000RPOCHU,"This is an excellent pair of documentries by the History Channel that examines the James'legendary murder and the mystery that continues to surround his death today. It consists of two documentries;""The Plot to Kill Jesse James"" and ""The James Gang: Outlaw Brothers"".
 Much has been written about the murder of Jesse James by Bob Ford,and the song about it is one of the best known songs from the Old West. This documentry centers around Bob Ford from his childhood days on a poor scrable farm,reading about James and his gang. Ford dreamed of the days when he could become as famous as Jesse,and eventually actually became one of Jesse's gang members. Jesse never really thought much of Ford,and didn't let him accompany the gang on their exploits;rather he used Ford as a gopher. This led to him killing James. The documentry also details what became of Ford after the murder.
 The other documentry details the story of Jesse James and his family,the Youngers,and their exploits. It does a great job of showing how the public viewed The James Gang,and how many spmpathized with them. It also shows the resentment of how the Southeners (Confederates) felt after The Civil War,especially how they were treated by the North (Union or ""Carpetbaggers) .
 So much has been written,and so many movies have tried to tell the whole story. There are the facts,but fiction and legend abound;so today it is difficult to separate it all. I guess this pair of documentries is probably as factual as any;and it sure is entertaining.",1352937600,4,1519,4.902723735408561
8202243,5,B000RPOCHU,I was very happy to learn more of not only the great Jesse James but also of Frank James. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Histroy.,1314921600,,142,4.107142857142857
8202244,5,B000RPOCHU,"The DVD about Jesse James (presented as on the History Channel) is like watching a movie concerning the real life of Jesse James and how people feared and yet revered him!  It tell the story of a young man who made it his business to become of the Jesse's outlaws, but ultimately ended up killing Jesse James by shooting him in the back.  Very interesting.  I'm very happy to have it in my collection.",1217030400,4,401,4.391891891891892
