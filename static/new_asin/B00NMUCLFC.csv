another brilliantly quirky selection from eclipse!  only very recently has kinoshita's ouevre (49 films) come out in japanese box-set;  these 5 films are the first 5 of his career, and all wartime films.  kinoshita is now known as a serious anti-war filmmaker and it is quite astonishing how he managed to get his message across, despite the heavy film censorship policy in place at the time.

FLOWERING PORT (1943) is a satire about 2 con-men working a scam to deceive simple boondockers into investing in a non-existent company.  it is ultimately the virtuous rubes who manage to make honest men of the crooks, played brilliantly by character actor ozawa eitaro [the wannabe-samurai brother-in-law in mizoguchi's Ugetsu] and the world's best melodrama actor uehara ken [the bus-driver in shimizu's Mr Thank-you].

LIVING MAGOROKU (1943)  has uehara & a cast of greats depicting the struggles to surivive rationing and other wartime deprivations in a little village.  a heavy-metal, straight propaganda film but weird & interesting nonetheless.  NOTE: very bad transfer!  it can be watched & understood, but there was no attempt to clean it up.  only film in the box with this problem.

JUBILATION STREET (1944) makes a similar theme much darker, showing the small & large tragedies befalling civilians in a patriotic neighborhood, amongst them the wasteful death of the romantic lead (uehara) in a pilot training accident.  it is both a bleak & moving film, shot on cheap sets with a tiny budget but with blistering performances by a fine ensemble cast including iida choko &  tono eijiro.  a sublime episode is the funeral held for their printing press by the local printer (himori shin'ichi) & his family before it is taken away by army requisition order to be melted down for metal.

ARMY (1944) is a masterpiece, ending with one of the most famous scenes in japanese filmdom as tanaka kinuyo watches her teenage son march off to battle in a glorious parade down main street thru cheering crowds.  it is a bio-pic about the boy growing from a timid kid into a budding soldier, urged on by his facist-policy-spouting dad (the great ryu chishu).  the film was roundly panned by the critical establishment for the last scene and soon removed from theatres.  apparently it was initially OKed by the pre-production censors because the scene (14 minutes) is wordless and was described in the scenario simply as ""she runs downtown to see him off to war.""  tanaka's performance in this scene is unparalleled by anything in her future career, altho it ensured her stardom forever.

MORNING IN THE OSONE FAMILY (1946) was one of japan's first post-war releases, telling a wartime story of the suffering of an elite tokyo family when its scion is arrested for left-wing activities.  he is reviled by his patriarch uncle (ozawa) but supported by his mum (the brilliant sugimura haruko, star of naruse's Late Chysanthemums).  a really great cast (tokudaiji shin, miura mitsuko, osaka shiro) in the earliest of the popular postwar genre of soul-searching political films.

japanese wartime films as a whole are almost never available in subtitle so this is the very rarest of collections, and by a great master director.  the release of this set is a very thrilling historical event.  satisfaction guaranteed.",1412035200,49,3416,5.0
