The content is totally different and since he doubles up himself as the editor and the cinematographer as well, one thing we can be assured of is that it is going to be a technically superior film. This film tells us about the problems that high flying urban couples face in their day to life which may also start affecting their relationship and then they think as to what cost they are chasing fame and money if they can't spend time with their loved ones?

This film is hugely inspired by Norman Jewison's Hollywood flick Only You (1994) starring Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. and tells us about an urban couple Neil and Nikita who have a fight one day and they go each other's way to work. The day end with Nikita's death in an accident. That is when Neil realizes the actual value of her presence in his life. He gets up next morning only to realize that it had been a bad dream. He tells Nikita about it though he can't explain the full situation well enough for her to realize anything. As the day passes, it is proved that the same sequence of events which had taken place in his dream take place one after another in reality and eventually just the end changes as instead of Nikita it is Neil who dies in an accident.

There is a very interesting character in the film called the Magician played very well by Saheb as the person who is constantly performing magic and seems to be the controller of our fate. The performance have been excellent and specially the music by noted music arranger Joy Sarkar who turns music director with this film. We even see noted editor Rabi Ranjan Maitra in the role of a conductor which has suited and even Riingo and Rituparna make an appearance as part of the audience in a sequence.",1277942400,2,1898,4.4511494252873565
