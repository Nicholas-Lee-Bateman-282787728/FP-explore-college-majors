4217540,5,B003XMKN7M,"The first disc is the best documentary about Rory I've seen anywhere. One can see why he developed into such a unique performer, song-writer, singer, guitarist, and all-around admirable human being - so rare in the music, or for that matter, any business. It is spiced with many brief cuts of him performing throughout his long but attenuated career.

The second disc is packed with sixteen live songs, shown for the first time (at least that I've seen).

It is early Rory - raw and spontaneous. What it lacks in polish it makes up for in sheer intensity, presence, and joy. He is a consumate performer making love to his guitar, his audience, his talent. He is the Buddy Rich of the guitar. Nobody did it better. Watching him perform here is like sitting next to the stage and discovering a world-class talent for the first time. YOU ARE THERE...

Further, the production quality (visuals and sound) are first-rate. One viewing of ""Hands Up"" and ""Messin' With the Kid"" shows why Rory achieved so much notariety among music professionals. Is it too bad he never released a single, never courted pop fans, chose to play with Muddy Waters, Albert King, and Albert Collins, instead of the Stones or Deep Purple?

You be the judge. But I'll take Rory just like this. Duane Allman may have inspired Ronnie van Zant to write his anthem, ""Free Bird""  but Rory WAS ""Free Bird"" - in every way, soaring, diving and ultimately achieving legendary status - but yet ephemeral, unknown to the masses yet intimately adored by the select who appreciate sheer artistry for artistry's sake - not cheap thrills or glitsh.

Oh, what we would have missed if Rory hadn't been true to himself.

Rory Gallagher is the gift that keeps on giving to his adoring fans across generations and around the world.

If you have stumbled on this review, go the last yard and purchase this DVD collection. It will change your perspective on music forever.",1288828800,9,1919,4.724550898203593

I think these Beat Club performances are even better. Sound quality is very good, picture quality is good, but the performance is jaw dropping.

4217543,5,B003XMKN7M,"Rory Gallagher was one of the most underrated guitarists/songwriters of the classic rock era, if not THE most. Like Clapton, he came into his own around the time that blues and rock were coming together to produce the kind of music at the forefront of the late 1960's. While hugely popular in Europe, he never took off in the United States, and sadly he still hasn't got his due. The documentary part of this 2-DVD set explains how his lack of Top 40 presence was largely due to his integrity to his own music and not bending to popular trends or watered-down versions of his songs in order to crack the mainstream. That, along with the fact that he wasn't a ""shredder"", kept his awareness in the mainstream from equaling that of Clapton, Ted Nugent, etc. However, looking back now in this world of crap music reigning the charts, such integrity makes him a hero to true and pure music, underlining the now-obsolete concept that talent is more important than the almighty three-minute single with cliche lyrics and unoriginal melodies. More people should follow Rory Gallagher's example and more important, listen to his music! The man was a remarkable guitarist, singer and songwriter. Well, not the greatest singer, but good enough, and he did have a unique and identifiable style. As did Jimi Hendrix, Rory possessed talents in other areas that more than made up for any shortcomings as a vocalist.

The performance DVD is fantastic, showing the power of Rory's 3-piece group in the blues-rock tradition set by Cream and Hendrix. He also performs some excellent acoustic numbers to change it up. This is the only video footage that I know of that features Wilgar Campbell, his first drummer, who turns in a fantastic performance, along with his trusty right-hand man Gerry McAvoy on bass. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1287964800,6,1811,4.87987012987013
4217544,4,B003XMKN7M,"I was fortunate to see Rory Gallagher perform live twice and talk to him briefly.  What an amazing talent and soulful, humble guy.  I have read biographies and watched several concert videos.  ""Ghost Blues"" is a wonderful collection of live performance footage ... some of which I have never seen before.  The interviews are interesting and give a perspective of Rory -- the person, the musician -- as well as how he fit in with the tremendous changes taking place in the music world, Ireland, and popular culture.  For fellow guitarists, the Beat Club sessions are very clearly filmed ""live studio"" performances where you can really see the fundamentals of Rory's technique.  Overall, there are many moments in this collection that capture the sheer energy and excitement that Rory generated in his live performances.",1287100800,23,818,5.067164179104478
4217545,5,B003XMKN7M,"This is an excellent DVD with early live TV show performances and a really great film about Rory Gallagher. It would be a good 1st introduction to him.

Still excellent tho...good sound, this is a must have for any Rory Gallagher fan.",1286928000,5,357,4.682539682539683
4217546,5,B003XMKN7M,"Rory Gallagher has been ""well represented"" on DVD releases over the past 10 years.  ""Rockpalast"", ""Montreaux"", and ""Irish Tour '74"" to name a few...With the new release of ""Ghost Blues"" and ""Beat Club Sessions"" we finally have a release of the Vintage Rory 1971-1972 era!  I am a huge fan and love all of Rory's Music.  Yet if I was forced (at gunpoint) to pick a favorite era, I would have to say his first two solo albums, ""Rory Gallagher"" and ""Deuce"" are my favorites!

Disc two is 90 minutes of pristine quality great performances from those two records!  Sound & picture quality are Fantastic, the only minor glitsch is the backgrounds for the ""Beat Club"" show can be a little annoying at times.  Rory plays fantastic, as does his band of Gerry McAvoy on Bass and Wilgar Campbell on Drums.
Highlight include ""Hands Up"", ""Sinner Boy"", ""Just the Smile"", ""Crest of a Wave"" and ""Messing with the Kid"".  I can't even begin to describe the great feeling that this timeless, high quality Music provides.  Rory was a master and this is a fine document to surface some 38 years later!!!  He would be proud of how well it sounds today!

Disc One is the ""Rory Story"" and it is the first such attempt at that and is a pretty good job.  I'd have liked to see more Rory interviews, but will not complain as I feel that they did a good job and I learned a lot!
Now if only they can secure the rights to the entire film of Taste at Isle of Wight!  I know that they're trying!
If you Love Rory then this set is a must.",1285027200,30,1506,4.320284697508897
4217547,5,B003XMKN7M,"Ghost Blues The Story Of Rory Gallagher is a must have for any Rory Gallagher fan or for anyone who simply loves the great Blues guitarists! This fantastic 2 disc dvd set covers the life of Rory Gallagher from his childhood in Ireland to his untimely death in England at the young age of 47. Born William Rory Gallagher on March 2, 1948, Rory was the first child of Daniel and Monica Gallagher, who both were musically talented with not only singing, but Daniel also played accordian. At around age 5 or 6, Rory loved to sing and play his songs on a little dimestore plastic ukelele. It wasn't long before Rory's parents bought him his first real wood guitar at the young age of 9. Rory quickly showed his natural talent and began winning talent contests, using the prize money to buy yet a better guitar. In 1961 Rory's parents bought him the very first Fender Stratocaster guitar in Ireland- a Sunburst model which cost 100 pounds. Rory's younger brother Donal tells many great stories about Rory on this dvd and about how this guitar might as well have cost 100 million pounds, as his parents went into great debt to afford this gift for Rory. Rory used this very famous guitar through every decade up until his death in 1995.

There are many very rare pictures, films and stories on this tremendous dvd about Rory. He was the first great Blues guitarist in Ireland who opened the doors for all the other great Irish bands such as Thin Lizzy,  U2 and many others. There are also many great photos, stories and films from Rory's first band from the sixties, The Taste. Besides many great commentaries and stories from his brother Donal, we also hear from Bob Geldof, Bill Wyman, Cameron Crowe, his bandmates, many others and Rory himself on this dvd. The stories from his brother Donal are wonderful, as we hear how there were no blues bands in Ireland, so Rory had to learn everything from listening to Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly and other blues greats on the radio and tv. Rory's genius didn't stop with just the guitar, he also played slide guitar, alto saxophone, bass, mandolin, banjo, harmonica and coral sitar. He was well known playing at the Marquee Club in the U.K. sharing the stage with other greats such as Cream.

On the second dvd are rare, never before seen performances from The Beat Club Sessions in 1971 and 1972. These early, rare performances have been  cleaned up so the picture looks absolutely fantastic with crisp colors and superb sound! The cameras showcase Rory's early guitar work and is a real treat to see up close! A very young Rory is joined by Gerry McAvoy on bass guitar and Wilgar Campbell on drums playing the following songs:
1.  Laundromat
2.  Hands Up
3.  Sinnerboy
4.  Just The Smile
5.  Used To Be
6.  In Your Town
7.  Should've Learned My Lesson
8.  Crest Of A Wave
9.  Toredown
10. Pistol Slapper Blues
11. I Don't Know Where I'm Going
12. Going To My Hometown
13. I Could've Had Religion
14. McAvoy Boogie
15. Hoodoo Man
16. Messin' With The Kid

In the late 80's, Rory began to have health problems and in 1995 he had a successful liver transplant. Just before being released from the hospital, Rory developed a MRSA infection. His health quickly deteriorated and he died on June 14, 1995. Ireland lost their leader of the Irish rock movement and the world lost a great blues guitarist, singer, songwriter and bandleader. This dvd set is a fitting tribute to Rory Gallagher whose life was too short, but whose tremendous talent will live on forever through his great trailblazing blues music!",1284681600,54,3539,4.614649681528663

Rory was but a step behind Jimi and in some ways surpassed him, if only because he played for longer. They both ploughed their own road and heaven help anyone who got in their way. The concert footage in both the documentary and the accompanying session extras show a man brimming with delight while playing, especially when soloing. Anyone who has played the guitar at any level above ""three chords"" can identify with this delight and ride along with him. For the rest, this is the definitive contemporary blues guitar biopic and the perfect subject to display in this way. What a player, what a story. It would have been wonderful to have had more words from Rory himself, but then that's the way he was - he spoke through his guitar, his faithful old Strat, as worn as he was by the journey.

4217583,5,B003XMKN7M,"This a very impressive documentary - insightful throughout and at times moving.
I say insightful because as someone who flatters himself an expert at Rory-ness, there were still
numerous scenes showing anecdotes about him I was unaware of. And I say moving because ... well ...
how can anyone watch Rory do his thing and not be moved - both to exhilaration and despair?
When he wanted to go uptempo, Rory could out rock anybody.  And when Rory played the blues you KNEW he was
telling truth about it.

In the 1970s my friends and I came of age listening to ""Rory"" - no last name was necessary, just ""Rory.""
He was our Elvis.  We loved his music for its authenticity and we loved him for the same reason - authenticity.
We wore blue jeans & flannel shirts and we drank beer. And we wanted - needed - music to speak to us AND about us.
On all accounts Rory Gallagher delivered.

The day I heard Rory had died was a sad sad day. The first time I ever got misty-eyed over the passing of
someone I had never met. (Tho a half-dozen or so of my buddies had shaken his hand, either from the stage edge
or at music store visits Rory made while in our town.)

He was a purist, the music meant everything.  There's a lot to be admired about that and
Ghost Blues: The Story of Rory Gallagher provides an excellent means to do so.
Rest in peace Rory. And from myself and on behalf of my buddies, thank you for providing us so much
enjoyment - and guidance on how to approach life - over the years.",1419379200,,1484,4.24468085106383

The other disc is top notch-quasi-pshycedelic backgrounds notwithstanding(think on Cream's Albert hall gig,sort of).Rory plays a lot of stuff from his early albums and whilst the renditions stay faithful to the vinyl,the solos often let rip in another direction.

Interviews go in depth about the kind of person rory was and how detailed he presented his music and why he did it the way he did. For example you will hear why rory didn't like to put his music on singles or have them put on the charts as singles. You'll hear how other musicians percieved him as a musician and what kind of person he was not talking about music. You'll hear about his childhood up bringing and how he started playing,when he got his first guitar and the influence it had on him. You'll also hear about all the small venues he played right up to the big concerts he performed at. His family, ,friends, producers,band members, and numerous musicians tell it all on this wonderful documentary about the life of Rory Gallagher.

The first Documentary Disc is priceless as it not only contains an excellent account of Rory's career up to his final days but it is done with professional quality that includes a lot of never before seen footage especially that from the Taste era and the quality of the footage and sound is stunning.
Professional accounts of Rory during the Documentary from some of the celebrities that knew him were also tasteful.
Admittedly it brought my Wife and I to share a few tears near the end. What a needless loss but we were both extremely impressed.

The 2nd DVD Disc should speak for itself (I have been waiting for Decades for this stuff!)and the Video and Sound Quality once again are simply stunning. I am glad to see this get preserved for all time! The wait albeit long was well worth it! Honestly I think this set deserves the Blu-Ray treatment as it is that good!

I wasn't watching this for juicy gossip, its dignity is strength, but I thought it may have been alluded to as a source of some of his great music. The bonus disc is amazing.

There's a scene on stage in the doc from one of Rory's last gigs.  His body is bloated from the steroids, his face is contorted, and he's obviously in pain.  Very hard to watch.  I prefer to remember him as he was in the early days, so well represented on the second disc of the Beat Club performances.  So alive, vibrant and filled with energy, his talent just flowing from his fingers through his guitar and out of his amplifier.  As others have already noted here, these performances are astounding, proving yet again that Rory Gallagher was arguably the best guitarist of his time.  He didn't have to take a back seat to Hendrix, Clapton or Page.  In my opinion, only Jeff Beck was his equal in the ""classic rock"" era.

This DVD is exceptionally well produced, sound and picture quality are excellent.  I only hope Donal Gallagher is working on releasing the all-acoustic performance from Irish TV in 1977, and the Old Grey Whistle Test gig from Rory's 28th birthday in 1976.",1296864000,3,1214,4.574074074074074

I also learned on this set he could also play a very mean saxophone with a live clip to prove.  He was stubborn and a true bluesman in the sense of dedicating himself to the music sacrificing financial gain as he refused to release any singles or conform to a record companies demands.

After watching the ""Beat Club Sessions"" I had to pick my jaw up off the floor several times. I can not figure out how the video, and especially the audio, can be of such high quality, on something that was filmed almost 40 years ago. The performance by Rory and his band is just mind boggling. Rory's guitar work simply has to be seen, and heard, to be believed.

I bought this DVD about a week ago and watched it a couple of days ago.  I thought the format was great, the footage was very good and the appearances of younger stars like The Edge and Johnny Marr was really telling.  I really didn't know how much of a mantle Gallagher carried for Ireland before I watched this DVD.  I'm quite sure he didn't see it that way, but it was really interesting to follow his career as he built a name for himself during a time when many guitar heroes were building their own.  I didn't know much about Taste and now I went and bought that stuff as well.  I thought the guy was a solo artist!  The only song I knew until about ten years ago was ""Shadow Play.""  I'm glad I bought this DVD to fill in the blanks for me.  Now I own about a dozen of his records, but while music does do a lot of talking for a given artist, I love hearing what contemporaries and younger stars who revere the guy think too.  There is some of that 60's fake psychedelic collage type footage you see in old Blue Cheer videos, but overall it's a very impressive collection; both the story and the concert footage.

4217646,5,B003XMKN7M,"I suppose I'm quibbling here,I'm thankful for anything about Rory that comes out,but the documentary could have been a lot better. It's not ""bad"" per se, but fewer talking heads & more of Rory himself would have improved things. The Beat Club disc makes it all worth while! Wonderful & essential stuff, despite the occasionally annoying ""psychedelic"" camera work. I was lucky enough to see Rory 5 or 6 times, they are the musical high points of my life. I've seen them all & NOBODY is or was a better or more exciting musician than Rory in his prime!",1290470400,3,550,4.565656565656566

4217648,5,B003XMKN7M,"First, if you are Rory fan, buy this. Second, if you haven't heard Rory Gallagher, buy this.

This is fabulous DVD set with an outstanding comprehensive history of Rory's legendary life on one disc and a knock-out performance from his earlier days on the other disc. The documentary disc is very well done. The story and comentaries provide a nice insight into Rory's life, his impact on other musicians and why he still has legions of devoted fans to this day. The DVD with the beat club sessions is a jewel. It is the first footage I've seen from that era with Wilgar Campbell on drums and it is top notch. Great sound quality with three outstanding musicians performing at the top of their game. All the originals are superbly done and the cover of 'Toredown' is the easily the best ever by anybody. But then again, Rory was the best. A wonderful tribute to a legendary blues-rock musician.",1289001600,,893,4.616352201257862

WHAT MORE CAN BE SAID? >> Outstanding documentary, followed by truly Incredible Disc 2 LIVE Beat Club Sessions!

Rory, Hendrix & SRV my fav 3 - but there's so many more great Guitarists that never get the Spotlight or recording deal with a major label.

Rory reminds me that there is much to be said about being the HUMBLE LEGEND!

Miss him so much, genuine nice guy with a huge heart of gold.  God the good ones go too soon!!!
