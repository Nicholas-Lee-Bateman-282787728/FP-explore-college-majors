3437856,4,B0019K4YRU,"In numerous other reviews, both professional and otherwise, I've read about this movie not really being ""scary"" as some think it should be.  The fact is, like it or not, that this movie is not meant to be scary in any serious way.  It reminds me of another in the vein of the more recent Mummy films Hollywood has pumped out--those with more than the usual amount of CGI effects and more humorous than scary.  Even the dialogue and other situations rather quickly give this movie an intentional and rather comedic tone, as well.  Very often opportunities to heighten potential scare are purposely undercut by a humorous situation occuring simultaneoulsy.  (i.e. the bedroom scene with the inspector and the curator coinciding with the appearance of the phantom elsewhere in the museum).  Yes, too many people, I think, critique this movie on what they want it to be, rather than what it is and what it is meant to be.  If you take it for what it is, it's really a pretty entertaining and well-acted movie, with a sizeable amount of effective humor, and, oh yes, a mummy/phantom, as well.

Speaking of acting, that is one of the things which keeps this movie together, depsite whatever else.  The acting by all main characters (specifically the beautiful Sophie Marceau) is top-notch and better than what one typically sees in such films.  The excellent soundtrack also keeps the movie from being less than it would be otherwise.  The soundtrack is very Egyptian, with a hint of foreboding doom about it. That keeps the viewer from getting too convinced that the phantom is less than dangerous.  It also keeps reminding the viewer, very subtley and subconsciously, that the movie really is a horror movie after all.

Others have criticized the phantom in this movie for moving too much like a human and not like a phantom.  Some have said that such movement for a phantom is ""ridiculous"" and a sign of a low budget.  Well, let's not forget that this is a human being used by a phantom to accomplish its mission on earth.  So, on the basis of that fact alone (the rules which the movie creates for itself), let's not expect more than we should--or more than is realistic under the circumstances.  To the contrary, I would actually consider it ""ridiculous"" to have a human, as it is, moving like a phantom.

All in all, I enjoyed this movie quite well.  I don't necessarily recommend it to anyone, only because I know that some will still be compelled to judge it on the basis of how ""scary"" it is.  Again, if you do that, then you're certainly asking for disappointment.  On the other hand, if you you watch it with an ability to see and enjoy the humor, then I think you'll be pleased.",1231113600,7,2684,4.6440677966101696
3437857,3,B0019K4YRU,"Synopsis: An Egyptain sarcopacus is found hidden away in the back of a large storage room at the Louvre. As the resident experts begin their examination of the remains within strange events begin to plague the museum and the surrounding neighborhood. Frequent electrical shortages soon escalate into more serious occurances such as the disappearance of ancient Egyptain artifacts and the deaths of several museum employees while stories of a Phantom stalking the premises at night abound.

Meanwhile across the street from the legendary landmark a beautiful young woman named Lisa (Sophie Marceau) begins to hear strange voices and hallucinate. Are the two events connected and if so what does any of this have to do with the unidentified corpse within the sacophacus?

Critique: Released in '01 'Belphegor' is a moderately entertaining film offering surprisingly quirky and original dialogue, above average special effects and some nice atmospheric sequences of the mysterious Phantom cloaked in black gliding around the musuem. Add to the mix the charming Sophie Marceau who is always a plus to any film and you have the makings of a pretty enjoyable evening. On the negative side, the movie is a little overlong and there are some uneven spots that make it difficult to maintain your undivided interest.

My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.",1222992000,6,1333,5.219626168224299

3437864,1,B0019K4YRU,"This movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  When I ordered it I didn't realize it was in French with English subtitles.  That didn't bother me and was about the only thing that kept me interested for the first hourish.  I quit watching it because there was NOTHING good about it.  It was poorly acted, there were NO SPECIAL EFFECTS, I honestly would not recommend this to anyone regardless of what type of movie you like...I love French so I enjoyed listening to the words...that is about it!",1354752000,,516,4.4
3437865,5,B0019K4YRU,I enjoyed this film (even with the sub-titles). Watched it twice on the same day I received it. One of my new all time favorite horror/thrillers. Great story line.  I shall show it to my girls on Halloween.,1351209600,,206,4.421052631578948

3437867,2,B0019K4YRU,"I'm a big Sophie Marceau fan and wanted to give this movie a try. While I'm still a huge fan of hers, I have to believe this is not her best work. The story is weak, the special effects are bad and for the most part the acting isn't very good either.

It's nice that several scenes were shot inside the Louve and some nice shots of Paris. Of course Sophie Marceau is always easy on the eyes too. But if it wasn't for those 3 things the rest of the movie is nearly unwatchable.

Sophie Marceau has done some excellent work and I look forward to watching some more of her movies. Every actor/actress makes a few duds in their career and for her this is probably it.",1297296000,,663,4.131782945736434

8274206,4,B0019K4YRU,"Bought it for Sophie Marceau and was not disappointed in that regard.  Not a scary movie at all, but had a couple of good moments.  It is really more of an art film and it was made in the actual Louvre.  If you want the traditional Mummy, this is not for you.  This is more a possession or a phantom and the special effects are kind of poor.  I still liked it myself, but I wouldn't recommend it for horror buffs.",1487289600,,413,4.049382716049383
