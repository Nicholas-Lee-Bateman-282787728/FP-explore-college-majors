5882575,5,B00E0KWBE4,"Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade is now my favorite Christmastime movie.  This delightful holiday romance has it all....a terrific script, excellent acting, great music, humor, and it is family friendly. It doesn't get any
better than this for movie entertainment.  The actors and everyone involved in this film can be proud of their efforts.  It's a winner.  Don't miss seeing this.  The DVD is worth whatever it costs.",1382140800,3,423,5.072463768115942
5882576,5,B00E0KWBE4,"This is one of the BEST Hallmark movies ever! The chemistry between these two is wonderful and such a joy to watch! I could watch this movie at least once a day! My only wish is that there were more men out there like Henry! I love, love, love the grocery scene!",1381968000,6,262,4.0576923076923075
5882577,5,B00E0KWBE4,"This is my 1st time review, Ever!!  That is how much I  loved this movie :0)  I have made several of my family members watch this movie and they truely give it a thumps up!  The kind of movie you want to watch every year as the Christmas season starts rolling around!",1381622400,6,267,4.076923076923077
5882578,5,B00E0KWBE4,"Yes! Five stars... Warm and charming. Has a terrific supporting cast who carry their respective roles with grace and timing.
This great little flick by Hallmark is definitely a keeper! It is a wonderful prelude  to the holiday season by starting with all of the preparations for a grand parade down State Street for the Thanksgiving holiday. It is a story of a romance which isn't, a person who doubts romance and limits it to a certain number of dates. How does this all work out? Well you'll just have to watch it! This movie will be a keeper for so many of you. Enjoy!",1380240000,21,571,4.438095238095238
5882579,5,B00E0KWBE4,"I'm so happy this movie is coming to DVD. I agree with the other reviewer that said there's not many Thanksgiving movies available and I think this is definitely the best of the ones I have seen. The plot is really cute too- Emily is in charge of the Thanksgiving Day parade in Chicago every year and it has a special significance to her, but this year a handsome financial consultant who does not share her love of the parade, is hired to cut costs. At first, the two clash of course, but that slowly changes. The chemistry between these two characters is really cute and I love the setting of the movie and the romantic holiday feel with a little comedy thrown in. I especially love the karaoke scene. A must own!",1380240000,24,715,4.383458646616542
5882580,5,B00E0KWBE4,"Ever since I first saw this movie on Hallmark Channel, I have been addicted to it. I DVR'd it right away and could not wait for it to be available on DVD. It is charming, funny, witty and the music is great. You will fall in love with both characters and the chemistry between Antonio Cupo and Autumn Reese is amazing. It has become my favorite holiday movie. It is great to watch how Henry gets to know Emily and how he falls in love with her. You won't be disappointed. Some reviewers are not happy with the way it ends, Henry dressed as Santa and he pulls off the beard at the end, but since children who believe in santa won't be watching this movie, it ends very welll. Enjoy it !!",1380067200,47,686,4.165413533834586
5882581,5,B00E0KWBE4,"This movie has been on my DVR since it was on TV last Thanksgiving. I was so excited to see that it's coming out on DVD. It's clean, humorous, romantic, and appropriate for family viewing. A must-have holiday movie for sure!",1379980800,30,224,4.487804878048781

5882592,2,B00E0KWBE4,"I am not a romance movie kind of gal... until the Christmas season that is. I was hoping to start early this year with a Thanksgiving Hallmark movie but I was not a fan. I have found that the ones I really enjoy are usually big city girl goes to a small town, falls in love with the slower pace and townspeople, throws away her NYC life and stays. A flat out romance is not really for me... I would rather it be the side dish. This was all about a woman who wants nothing more in life than to get married. Some of the scenes were cringe-worthy (think karaoke and doing the robot) and I felt the characters lacked depth and chemistry. However, if you love Hallmark romances year round, you may enjoy it. I am personally always up for a stupid B horror movie, so I'll knock this one up to genre preference seeing all the positive reviews.",1511740800,,836,4.23125

5882658,5,B00E0KWBE4,"An overly enthusiastic parade coordinator (Autumn Reeser as Emily Jones) quickly finds herself having to deal with an unwanted consultant (Antonio Cupo as Henry Williams) who has a calculator for a heart.  He isn't interested in the festivities, he just wants to know how much it will cost and can they charge parade watchers a fee!  Hes a jerk and shes maniac.  She maintains a relationship with a guy via the computer; he breaks up with his last date on the phone.  They are both control freaks.  Hes stuffy and she buys and wears vintage clothing that she hopes might have belonged to her mother.  Reluctantly, begrudgingly, they come to (eventually) appreciate each other.  Before they know it, they're smitten.

Its a cute movie without being overly saccharine.  Both leads are likable.  The ending was a foregone conclusion but it was fun watching the plot work its way in that direction.",1448755200,2,894,4.860927152317881

5882712,4,B00E0KWBE4,I saw this when it premiered in 2012 and feel this is a film to add to one's collection to start the holiday season. What did strike me was when Autumn Reeser's character appeared in a replica of Jackie Kennedy's pink outfit including pillbox hat the day President Kennedy was assassinated. I was wondering if Hallmark got permission to use this since the one worn by Mrs Kennedy has been locked away until 2103. Just the image of a similar outfit brings back memories of that infamous day.,1419465600,,490,4.579545454545454

5882714,5,B00E0KWBE4,"Yes, Hallmark has created another superb Christmas romance in this one.  The chemistry between the two main characters is one of the keys to its success, but not the only one.  I liked the music, which starts the movie off with a bang as we see Chicago and set the stage for the story.
  And the story is a very nice one; the two main characters seem the least likely in the world to like each other -- they are rivals and seem to be polar opposites.  She's in love with a great guy, he's just broken up with yet another woman, whom he's convinced is not for him --he has a 5 date rule.
  Of course we know they're going to get together -- that's the way these things usually work out, after all.  But it's the trip down that long, long road that helps seal the deal and make the movie as good as it is.
  I first saw it a month ago and enjoyed it again this week.  It is, in my opinion, one of the best of the very many Christmas movies out there.",1419379200,,948,3.9893617021276597

She loves vintage clothes and there is a touching reason why; he brings his own linens to a wonderful hotel. Both have alot in common, though on the surface it doesn't appear that way.

5882837,5,B00E0KWBE4,"What a fun movie!  There is a lot of chemistry between the two lead actors.  This heartwarming love story set around the Thanksgiving parade in Chicago centers around Emily, the Thanksgiving Parade Coordinator and Henry the handsome consultant hired to cut costs.  These two likable characters at opposite ends, argue and banter beautifully as sparks and tension fly between them.  The music and the occasional split screen, highlights Emily and Henry's angst and turmoil for each other. This gem of a film is reminiscent of successful romantic films of the 60's. When Emily's fiancee of five years returns, it thickens the plot resulting in twists and surprises. The vintage attire worn by Emily throughout the film is charming and exemplifies the character's love for the past, propelling her to protect the city's history and annual Thanksgiving parade. Autumn Reeser as outspoken Emily gives a performance that is funny, vulnerable and adorable! ""Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade"" is sheer delight and acted with great comedic pacing. The Karaoke scene is not to be missed. I love this movie!",1387843200,3,1099,5.157303370786517

I enjoyed watching their relationship grow. I liked the vintage clothing the star actress wore and her joy of life. We learn that as she was knocked down through events in her life, she got back up. The passion she had to keep the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade true to its roots was wonderful to see.  I enjoyed learning some of what it takes to bring the MTDP together as well. The star actor was a true gentleman throughout the movie. This budding romance flowed nicely throughout the movie. My husband (yes, I said, my husband) and I will watch this movie again and again. We watched it several times on the DVR and decided we would add it to our library and lose the commercials!",1386633600,2,849,4.549019607843137

movie enough to watch it twice already. I particularly liked the karaoke scene, and I liked the surprise about Henry's
early life. This movie is acceptable for family viewing-no bedroom scenes or swearing, which is so rare, even in some
supposedly PG movies. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a little time escaping from the reality of their
daily routine.",1386374400,,486,4.867469879518072

Added to my collection of Christmas movies. Autumn Reeser and Antonio Cupo are perfect together.,1386288000,,270,4.583333333333333
5882856,5,B00E0KWBE4,"At least one Christmas movie a year spins such charm that it pulls me in and I am reminded why I hold such a fondness for Christmas movies. This year, Love at the Thanksgiving Parade wins the pick for new favorite.

Emily Jones (Autumn Reeser) loves her life. Every day she gets to go to a job she loves  one that is perfectly tailor made for her, and sneaks in Skyping time with her marine biologist almost-fianc, Brian in-between his travels and busy work schedule. A Chicago native and cops daughter, Emily thrives on being the best at her job as a coordinator for the annual parade with a specialty in knowing all the historical details and this year, it seems nothing could ruin her happiness that is until Henry Williams (Antonio Cupo) comes along. Henrys job is to close out places that aren't earning the city any revenue and despite their less-than-cordial encounter, Emily and Henry are about to be paired off as working colleagues since part of his job as an independent consultant is being tasked with figuring out if the parade is still worth the resources and time it demands.

You already know that I really loved this movie from the opening comments so I suppose now what Ill ramble about is the why behind loving this telefilm although other than saying this film was superior, Im not sure what more to say! Judging by its seasonal genre, I am not sure when the last time was that I fell head over heels for a Christmas flick. Certainly up until now nothing has topped the sweet stories of 'The Christmas Card' or 'A Princess for Christmas' however this film held its own and one viewing later, I knew that again Hallmark had scored another winner. Too many films  particularly televised ones, rush their story and leave the audience feeling (partially) cheated out of a full circle concept. This one had a nice pace and the progression seemed very easy both for the story line and the characters.

This script was really fantastic. It added in some unique quirks that sought to blend the worlds of contemporary and vintage and fortunately, the filmmakers vision worked just right. Many of the scenes do a stupendous job of putting us in mind of the 40's/50s era with its taste for vintage fashion, settings  Emilys apartment and her determination that books are far more original than a download (see, this girl is awesome) and an adorable heroine whose goal for living in the past is to feel close to her mother, which brings me to the characters. They were so delightful and fun and special. Henrys wealthy businessman persona was portrayed convincingly well by Antonio whom Id not seen in anything before, yet thoroughly enjoyed as a leading man (he reminded of a young Peter Gallagher). Autumn pulled off a beautiful vintage look and with exception to one or two ensembles which looked horribly misplaced, she sported all of the cloths with snazzy style  and I applaud designers for putting together such a complimentary wardrobe. These two were also adorable together (did I already mention this?); I mean, their chemistry is infectious  they made fighting fun with plenty of sparks and it was sweet seeing the care and time Henry took to help Emily overcome some of her fears, basically, we find ourselves waiting for their next moments together.

Though filmed in Canada, the Chicago setting was different, making the location somewhat unique to most films that are either in a small town or the big cities of the west and east coasts. Adding in the conflicting personalities of the characters (modern world vs. the old soul) was also something that added a memorable back-and-forth proving that cute flirting doesnt always have to entail a bad vs. good scenario. Eventually, the conclusion may be one of those things that viewers have a hard time accepting as realistically satisfactory, however speaking for myself, this film is possibly the best holiday script Ill watch this year. It sparkled (with so much personality) all the while retaining a special kind of genuine feeling than most Christmas movies manage to compel and thats why this one dazzles.",1386028800,2,4082,4.803418803418803

This Hallmark Movie was great! It is well - written, smart dialogue and come backs, this movie ""makes you all giddy"". I was rooting for them. The chemistry was awesome.

I saw this  few days ago on the Hallmark Channel and having watched a lot of the movies there (don't judge. LOL ), I can truly say - this movie is my favorite of them all.",1383782400,15,557,4.186915887850467
5882899,5,B00E0KWBE4,"- A disconsolate Emily: ""Thank you for the drink. I don't really drink, so I'm beginning to feel it.""
- A concerned Henry: ""...It's ginger ale.""

Emily Jones (Autumn Reeser) is an operations manager in Chicago, but that only describes what she does to make ends meet. Who she is, is a book enthusiast and a champion of old buildings. Her fashion taste leans toward vintage. She's an unofficial historical archivist. One of her great joys is coordinating Chicago's annual Thanksgiving parade each year. Except that this year, a financial consultant is hired to rein in the event's expenses.

Now a mild plot SPOILER alert.

Veteran of watching Hallmark movies that you are, you're clued in to the formula. We both know that 99.9% of the time, there's a happy ending around the corner. So the draw isn't in the destination, it's in the getting there. We know with rock-sure certainty that Emily Jones and that urbane consultant, Henry Williams (Antonio Cupo), will butt heads, what with Emily the sentimental idealist and Henry, the calculating bottom dollar fella. To her horror, he suggests that they charge people to attend the parade. More obstacles? Emily is in a five-year, long distance relationship with a marine biologist, and she's fretting that he hasn't proposed yet. Henry abides by the five date rule (because after five dates, she gets serious and so he bails).

There is such a plethora of made-for-television holiday films that get churned out yearly, I've become stingy doling out them 5 out of 5 star ratings. LOVE AT THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE deserves five stars, maybe even more stars, it's that charming and watchable. It truly gets you in the holiday mood. And, by the way, to make it interesting, I've here and there injected mention of several Thanksgiving-themed films I'd watched in years past that did NOT at all get me in the right holiday mood.

There's tremendous and undeniable chemistry between Autumn Reeser and Antonio Cupo. The film, in a wise move, opted to not portray Cupo's consultant as someone who requires a massive infusion of heart. Henry was already a good guy, it turns out. We the audience - and Emily - just needed to get to know him better. Okay, that'll be enough gushing about Antonio Cupo - dude's so damn suave and good-looking it's making me resent him.

So, stay away from HOME SWEET HOME(1981). It's about an escaped mental patient who runs into a family celebrating Thanksgiving and decides to murder them. It's really not a well done slasher film and when I saw this a few years ago, it ripped me out of that proper festive frame of mind. But there's a fun drinking game in that each time the family encounters car problems, take a shot.

Autumn Reeser is why I love this mov-

THANKSKILLING (2009) definitely put me off my feed two years ago. It concerns a homicidal turkey itching to embark on a killing spree. Luckily for the turkey, a gang of college kids comes home during the Thanksgiving break. Shot on a $3,500 budget, this movie is, er, fowl. Also, make sure the young 'uns are asleep when you put this on. Don't make the same mistake I did. I'm still paying for that.

But Autumn Reeser is why I love this movie. She is utterly captivating. Her character manifests such a joyful spirit and a deep yearning for romance. I think I fell in love with her within the first ten minutes. There are many moments that highlight how sweet and vulnerable she is. And if I had to pick my favorite scenes, they'd have to be Emily and Henry at the six star pizza parlor, Emily's explanation of why she wears vintage clothing (which may be the film's best scene), and the karaoke sequence with the Heart of Glass and Emily's weak (and yet awesome) robot dance. I don't mean to blaspheme by mentioning Audrey Hepburn and Autumn Reeser in the same sentence, but my favorite acting Hepburn did cross my mind whenever Reeser was on camera.

There's this welcome retro feel. Watching this is like being swept back to better days, back to when pictures were more innocent and weren't afraid to show those old-fashioned values. And when I say welcome retro feel, I of course don't mean BLOOD FREAK (1972). You may or may not regard this as a Thanksgiving movie but, hey, it's got a serial killer with a mutant turkey head. This lunatic was a more disturbing sight than Joey's shoving his head in that turkey in that one FRIENDS Thanksgiving episode.",1383696000,2,4396,4.697402597402597
5882900,5,B00E0KWBE4,Love  this movie. I saw it last year when it first aired on Hallmark and made it a point to try to see it every time it was on. It's a cute story and Autumn Resser and Anthony Cupo make a believable couple.,1383523200,,206,3.7906976744186047

the title and cover art do not do the movie justice",1383350400,4,328,4.433333333333334

5882903,5,B00E0KWBE4,Fun movie with lots of footage around Chicago. A Pleasant way to enjoy preparation for the parade and a good story with a really fun cast.,1383350400,4,138,4.346153846153846
5882904,5,B00E0KWBE4,"If you love romantic comedies(RC)like we do then you're in for a Thanksgiving holiday treat with this one.  It's perfect, full of fun, comedy, good actors, a Chicago backdrop, with lots of old fashioned style romance and conflict, exuding sexual tension without being vulgar or blatantly sexual.

Countdown to the Thanksgiving Parade.  The sentimental heroine, Emily(Autumn Reeser), is in charge of coordinating it, but by order of the city, she must work with, better said, contend with a handsome development consultant,""jerk"", Henry(Antonio Cupo), who is set on doing drastic changes in order to make the parade solvent.

Heads butt immediately between the two.  She determines to convince him of the worth of the parade as is.  What ensues is a series of funny romantic situations that the two constantly find themselves stuck in.

Several problems, of course, exist(*Alert-don't read ahead if you don't want to know absolutely anything about the story's premise*): 1. He's still a ""jerk"" about to sell out the parade; 2. She's has a boyfriend.  He's a marine biologist who's always away, and their relationship of 5 years is mostly via Skype.  They apparently love each other greatly, and he's coming back to propose to her; moreover, she's already bought her wedding dress. 3. Henry has commitment problems, i.e., after the 5th date he breaks up because the woman starts talking marriage.  Her friend sums it up with a true RC maxim: ""Men don't know they want a long term relationship.  That is until they meet the right woman.""  *End alert.*

The actors are terrific.  Studly, but not focused on it, Antonio Cupo plays the hero as an organized, calculating planner- self-absorbed, no place to call a home, his past haunts him.  If they gave out Oscars for Best Actress in a RC, it would go to Ms. Reeser.  Her Emily is cute and endearing- energetic, opinionated, deeply felt, she wears vintage clothes from the 50&60's, up for a fight if need be, with a strong front but a deep vulnerable core.  She dreams of only one thing(like many of us want and some of us are blessed to have).  She seeks true love with a lifetime partner through marriage.

This film uses every RC trick in the book.  Well done, nicely shot with characters that one cares about, probably the best RC with Chicago setting since ""While You Were Sleeping"".",1383264000,6,2333,4.873096446700508
5882905,5,B00E0KWBE4,"This is truly a family movie that the oldest as well as the youngest family members will enjoy. The casting is brilliant and the story line is so charming. I first saw this movie during the Christmas Hallmark series last year and vowed I would buy it as soon as it was available. I watched it soon after it arrived and it is well worth waiting to own it. The characters have just the right amount tension among them and the story unfolds in such a charming manner. Unlike most movies that unfold over a period of a few days, this one takes place over a few weeks and that one thing actually adds to the authenticity of the story. Okay, so its a chick flick but then I am a chick so it suited me fine. I may watch it again today!",1382745600,5,728,4.0979020979020975
5882906,5,B00E0KWBE4,Very good film to watch. Clean and sweet. I love the fact that Emily was wearing old vintage clothing and didn't care what others thought about it. It goes to show that it's confidence inside your heart that makes the outfit sparkle! I like the way the two characters sparred with each other and then the sweet way they fell in love.

It's kind of funny that Emily wears vintage clothing and uses vintage items: tea set, compact, etc. . The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of Brian, to me he is self-centered twit.
