I read my bible and was trying to find the biblical point of view with this movie.  I guess I will give it another try and try watching it a 2nd time.",1359849600,,202,3.8095238095238093
4690690,2,B005GISDXW,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing! I was disappointed because I had expected a higher quality level.  I know that many Judeo/Christian movies tend toward B quality and I choose to rent them anyway however I do feel I was a bit mislead about this one. I tried to watch it, really I did, but alas after 25 minutes I had to turn it off. I think it was the props that did it. I just couldn't take it seriously. The makers meant well and I admire their initiative but to agree to rent it out on Amazon surely wasn't a good idea. The movie description should clearly state it is an amateur film. Had I known that from the get-go, I might not have bemoaned the loss of $1.99 because I would have had only myself to blame.",1357257600,14,729,4.170212765957447
4690691,1,B005GISDXW,"I should have listened to my fellow Amazon reviewers! This movie has about 2% Biblically-sound material, and 98% of stuff that was either made-up or perhaps 'based on some extra-biblical writing'. The acting was bad, the cinematography was horrible, and the plot was a train-wreck. This film was so bad, it made me laugh (sadly). It is NOT even remotely close to the Biblical narrative, so if you were hoping for something based on The Bible, RUN the other way.
Sadly, this is the WORST movie I have seen in a long time. It is painful to watch, and by the first 15 MINUTES, you will see what I mean. (on the flip-side, its so bad its comical, so you may get a laugh out of it)...ugh...",1356480000,,685,4.4015748031496065

4690694,1,B005GISDXW,this is a cheesy production! the picture quality looks like kids holding their parents outdated video camera. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,1341878400,,129,5.190476190476191
4690695,5,B005GISDXW,"Not since 1953 when a black and white movie, ""Sins of Jezebel,"" came out, has any production company released a Bible movie depicting the life of the prophet Elijah.  Recently, Breadwin secured distribution through Celebrity Video Distribution to issue ""Blast and Whisper -- the Story of Elijah.""  Blast and Whisper is a solid entry into the low budget movie category.  You won't find Jim Caviezel, Charlton Heston, or Howie Mandel in it.  Nor will you experience dazzlling eighteen million dollar CGI.  Even so, if you can live with these facts then Blast and Whisper is the ONLY movie about Elijah's life that you will find in any library of DVD's more recent than the B&W effort Sins of Jezebel.  You will be well rewarded in purchasing this movie.  The Bible itself begins Elijah's story more or less in the middle of persecution, with Elijah's curse against the whole kingdom of Israel for swallowing hook line and sinker the Pagan agenda of the Sidonian Jezebel.  The makers of Blast and Whisper rounded out this first chapter of the story with some creative background about *why* this famous curse launches the conflict, and they chose to do it in a way that would make Scott Hahn proud.  I won't spoil the details, but suffice to say if you can live with the low budget nature of the film, you will find BLAST AND WHISPER an edifying and provocative retelling of the story of one of Christ's favorite prophets, a prophet Jesus Himself met with, in person, on the Mount of Transfiguration.  Good stuff!",1339027200,11,1510,4.75095785440613
4690696,1,B005GISDXW,"I never do reviews but felt obligated to do one on this movie -- this isn't what it seems as a 'true' biblical account. The first several minutes doesn't resemble anything of the prophet's accounts in Kings or Chronicles... strange music and canned dialog that grated on me along with bad acting. Fifteen minutes is all that I could take and that was pushing it. Can't figure out what 'bible' these people had read to make this movie. lol!!! Furthermore, this is about some 'whisper' in the winds. Okay, enough said..... :)",1325203200,38,523,4.695652173913044

First of all, it opened up with Elijah stuck under a fallen tree. I have no recollection of this happening in the bible. Second, it looks like they just went to the woods behind their house and filmed this. Third, it looks like they went to dollar tree to get their costumes. Also, I'm not sure why the movie is called Blast and Whisper but maybe that's something I didn't catch because of not watching the movie. Anyways I would recommend not watching this movie, just read the story straight from the bible and I'm sure you will have a better image in your head than what this movie portrays.",1469836800,2,758,4.345070422535211

4690718,1,B005GISDXW,"Being a Christian filmmaker myself I understand the great desire to communicate the good news of the Gospel to as many people as possible through whatever means available. Telling stories from the Bible that convey the gracious, loving kindness of the Lord as well as His righteousness and His judgements are powerful and should be told for all the world to see. I believe I understand the hearts of the producers of this film and their desire to tell this story but, to be totally honest, this production falls way short of even conveying the message of this story of Elijah in the Bible. The production quality is less then what you would expect from a junior high play. Every element of this movie is awful. The writers did't even stick to the Biblical narrative. The results of this poor planning and execution is a product that not only is insulting to the intelligence and sensibilities of the viewer, but is also not God honoring. In the Gospel according to Luke in the Bible, Chapter 14, verses 28 - 30 Jesus says ""For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who observe it begin to ridicule him, saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'"" The producers of this film did not calculate (or count) the cost of doing a God honoring job on this project and it shows. It would have been better to take on a much smaller project and concentrate on making it excellent than what you have here. For the potential viewers of this film, instead of watching this movie just go open your Bibles to 1st Kings, Chapter 16 verse 29 and read all the way to 2nd Kings, Chapter 2 verse 14. Reading the story of Elijah from the Word of God will give you a much more accurate account of the time that Elijah lived on this earth but a greater understanding of why God allowed and directed these things to occurred.
And just a word to the producers of this film (if you get a chance to read this). I know this review seem harsh but it's meant to help motivate you towards excellence in serving the God of the universe. Let's make quality our aim for our work and not mediocrity.

4690726,1,B005GISDXW,"ZERO STARS. WARNING.  This is a biblically inaccurate and bad movie. It has zero redeeming qualities. The movie's description is what made me want to see it in the first place. Huge waste of 20 minutes - that was all I could tolerate. Each passing second was excruciating.  I kept thinking that it would improve, but it never did.

I had to laugh when some trivia about the movie blamed the costume designer for backing out at the last minute.  Honey, the costumes were the least of this movie's issues!  Another chuckle I had when reading the trivia was when they bragged about an ""unprecedented"" second viewing.  I am guessing that the only reason for a second viewing was because of the movie's description and its artwork.  My question, how many people actually stayed in the theater for the entire screening.

Even they could have done better. Could never figure out what was happening. Watch about 40 minutes of it hoping it would get better never happened. .Boy what a waste of time. Tried to understand what it was about never could. Wouild have ratedit lower but you have to give at least one star.,1418860800,,569,4.524271844660194

4690819,1,B005GISDXW,"What bible were they reading. I have tried a number of times to watch this and I don't understand what they are talking about; or what is going on. I have read Elijah's story in the Bible. There is so much that would make a wonderful movie. The time on Mount Carmel when he challenges the priest of Bale, the time on the mountain when he hears the still small whisper of God. The time he brings the Widow's son back to life.
There is no way I see myself ever watching the whole movie. I just thank God that it did not cost me any money to try watching it in the first place.",1412553600,,574,4.0
4690820,1,B005GISDXW,The most stupidest movie ever. And terrible actors. And for the record its Elisha not Eliah. I broke the dvd in half. Plus it isn't event biblical.,1410480000,,147,4.481481481481482
4690821,1,B005GISDXW,I should have taken the time to read the reviews on this. What a waist of money. The camera production was so nauseating for the first 15-20 minutes that I almost turned it off but then the acting started and I couldn't even get through 10 mins. This is a terrible production! I really was hoping for a good Elijah movie. This movie really is the perfect example of 'Don't judge a movie by its cover',1410393600,,400,4.276315789473684

4690834,1,B005GISDXW,"This is the worst movie we have ever watched. The sound was awful, the actors were terrible and the filming was atrocious. In one scene electrical outlets were visible in what was supposed to be a city street in the time of Isiah. There was also a nice barbed wire fence around the horse pasture where they filmed part of it. We have read the Bible quite a bit it but it was almost impossible to recognize most of the miracles because they were so poorly done and we couldn't understand the dialog. Go read the Bible and skip this trash completely.",1405987200,,548,4.382352941176471
4690835,1,B005GISDXW,Probably one of the worst home made movies I have seen on Amazon....I was really hoping for a nice story about Elijah who is a great Bible Figure. I know Amazon is receiving a lot of requests from us to have more Bible and Christian movies available but the quality of this one is really below what should be the standards. I applaud the crew for making the movie but as with photos some need to be deleted and retaken.,1404086400,,419,4.25
4690836,1,B005GISDXW,"I don't like giving negative reviews but this was one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.  Not only was the acting subpar, but they were communicating in a way that made it difficult to follow; not to mention the very low budget quality.  Because of the content, I wanted to like this movie so much, but I have to be honest and say what I felt was true about the movie overall.  I'm sure there are lots of worth while movies out there, but unfortunately this was not one of them.",1403481600,,485,4.138297872340425
4690837,1,B005GISDXW,"Next time I better look at the reviews first.  This movie was a waste of my time. The acting was terrible, very amateur and it was music playing thru out the movie that was also very irritating.  The movie cover is very misleading",1401494400,,230,4.325581395348837
4690838,1,B005GISDXW,"Very hard to follow, not a movie exactly. They never really say God they only refer to him in a half way. There was a few points that I could pick out that came from the story of Elijah . I really expected it to be better.",1400284800,,222,3.74468085106383
4690839,4,B005GISDXW,"I will give it 4 starts because every film effort should be CELEBRATED. It's easy to criticize when you don't shoot not even a short film. However, Mark Moran's next movies will work if he takes care of certain elements. For example, costumes (they must be ironed before wearing. The camera lens sees EVERY DETAIL), wigs (ALL actors should wear wigs or NO actors should not wear them. Having real hair and wigs at the same time distracts the viewer. In fact, even in Hollywood many Medieval History movies look strange because of the wigs or hair extensions. And they DO HAVE MILLIONS to make movies. Only when actors let their hair grow it really looks beautiful). The main actor in this movie is REALLY GOOD. Mark should continue to hire him. Cinematography: There are many ways to add grain and saturate colors during post-production so that the film has a more interesting, stylistic look. Careful with those sandals! They should never look contemporary. Better barefoot! Finally, I congratulate Mark Moran and he should continue doing more of these to practice and get better at it. By the way, EXCELLENT POSTER. That's the look you want for your film. In fact, that's what made me click to view it.",1399161600,3,1204,4.76555023923445

4690841,1,B005GISDXW,"I've watched a lot of bad movies but this may be the worst. And I meant ""Tinny"". Being in the same room with these moving images is like the sound of an empty tin can thrown against a brick wall and rolling forever down a concrete slab. Annoying sounds at first but soon unbearable. It is an insult to say this is an amateurish effort as ""Amateur"" means one who works for the love of it. No one working on this flimsy experience could have possibly loved it. Yes, the story is biblical, but so poorly executed that it is an insult to its source.",1398124800,,545,4.2
4690842,2,B005GISDXW,I was quite disappointed in Blast and Whisper.  I thought the acting was poor and the movie itself was slow.  There are some really beautiful Christian movies on the market now but I didn't get that uplifted feeling from this movie as I have with others in the past.  It might work as a Sunday school lesson film but without the prophecies that were fulfilled and the lack of Godspeak...it has lost any kind of message(s) that it may have been trying to convey.  Really disappointed.,1397347200,,483,4.5813953488372094
4690843,1,B005GISDXW,"Sorry to post a negative review, but honestly, I turned it off after about 15-20 minutes.  Kept hoping the dialogue, costuming, filming technical issues might improve.  They didn't.  What a shame.",1396656000,,196,5.258064516129032

4690858,1,B005GISDXW,"The story was weak and only loosely followed the biblical account of Elijah. The acting was poor with virtually none of the characters being believable.

4690863,2,B005GISDXW,It seemed this movie was made in someone's back yard. Maybe it was someone's first attempt at movie making and they definitely had a very small budget because it shows.

4690881,1,B005GISDXW,"I think Amazon needs more movie critics like Roger Ebert, he being Jewish would have at least know the reality of Biblical Truth and Un-Biblical Fantasy. If one read the description of this film used by Amazon one would think this film was made by dedicated ""Believers"" limited in scope and funds but nonetheless dedicated to the ""true rendition of the Prophet Elijah.""  The clothing and costumes were not close to the period, the women looked more ""muslim"" if one can us that term, than what was worn in ""Biblical Times.""  As it has already been noted the ""narrative"" did not match with Biblical text or even context. This was neither a ""Good attempt"" at film making and as one person promoted this film for purchase, one can only infer that they were a part of the backers of this film hoping to regain their losses. I can only give this film one ""Star"" because the system won't allow me to give it zero stars. About the only positive description I have to say is that the Artwork on the ""DVD"" cover is more impressive, or deceptive than the film itself. Please Amazon, create another category under which films can be organised, if ""B"" movies expressed the Sci-Fi of the 1950's please relegate this film and probably others to ""Z"" movies: ""Better to sleep through"" Than to watch!!!

I decided to waste 5 more minutes to warn someone before they make the same mistake I just did. The cover looks promising, but ""Breadwin"" Productions are definitely selling wolf tickets.
