There were fourteen movies that featured Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. The first two, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, were set in the late 19th century. The others were set in modern times and supported the Allied war effort. Each movie is on one DVD unlike some other collections. For more details read the individual reviews for each movie. The best movies are based on the original stories. One flaw is the use of Dr. Watson for comic relief, unlike the original stories.
