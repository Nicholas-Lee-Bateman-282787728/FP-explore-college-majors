1271962,4,B00003CXQ0,"Fans of the last Rugrats movie won't be dissapointed. Rugrats in Paris is a entertaining movie with jokes for everyone in the family, and slapstick humor from the begining to the end. But underneath it all is a touching story about how important family really is. It all starts when Chuckie finds the need for a new Mommie at Grampa Lu and Lulu's wedding. Everything then gets thrown into chaos when Stu's called to Paris when it Reptar Robot goes crazy. Brining along the family, and the rest of the crew they find themselves in EuroReptar World, a Japanesse theme park in the middle of Paris. They meet the evil Madame Coco whose sceme is to marry Chaz in order to gain control of a family loving company. They also become aquainted with her evil Henchman Jean-Claude, and the gentle Kira and her daughter Kimmy, who happens to be a female version of Tommy.
If you're a fan of family movies and the Rugrats. You'll love this.",987033600,8,927,4.5568862275449105
1271963,3,B00003CXQ0,"One of the reviewers for this movie said it had 'something for everyone.'  Well, I'm a big fan of basically all types of movies, and to be honest, I was a little bored with this one.  I've always loved the cartoon, but maybe that's because it's only a half hour.  An hour and a half of Rugrats is just a little too much for me.
The film centers around the lives of several little children, but mainly one boy, Chucky, who's mom has died and who's Dad is now in the market for a new mom for him.  Dad's job takes him and the kids over seas to Paris where he must fix a broken-down amusement park ride.  While he's there, he meets a few perspective takers.
It's interesting how the story is told from the children's' points of view.  Something that might seem gross or inappropriate to an adult is a paradigm of interest to the tots.  The grownups are intelligent and can think for themselves.  Sometimes in movies geared toward children, the adults are merely objects to help move the story along, and not necessarily an important part of the central focus of the movie.  That is not the case here.  The music from the movie is generally good (with the exception of the atrocious ""Who Let the Dogs Out"") especially a song entitled ""I Want a Mom That Will Last Forever,"" a touching ballad sung by Cyndi Lauper.
The film is charming and touching in parts but still a bit juvenile for my tastes.  I was a little bored and found myself checking my watch, but the little ones around me were enthralled.",986688000,,1496,4.384057971014493

1271965,4,B00003CXQ0,"What makes the ""Rugrats"" show so interesting is it's moderate take on pop culture from a child's perspective. A great example of this was the intro of the first film in which Tommy Pickles, under the ""Okie-Dokey-Jones"" moniker go in search of a secret treasure a la ""Indiana Jones"". Eventually, they fail to grab the holy grail and a giant rock starts hurling towards Tommy, Chuckie and Phil and Lil. The ""rock"" soon turns into Didi's protruding Pregnant body and the four end up smacking the window face first. In ""Paris"", shortly after the title appears, a logo ""Rugrats II"" forms, similar to ""The Godfather"". Angelica acts as the ""Bobfather"" to the rest, sitting behind a desk listening to pleas of the other Rugrats for ""help"". For many of the young fans, this stuff will absolutely go over their heads.
This film is more plot driven than the original. One situation that has existed in the series for a long time is that Chuckie Finster really didn't have a mom. His birth mother, Melinda died earlier in Chuckie's life. Chas, Chuckie's father, has once again started to date again. Around the start at Grandpa Lou and Lulu's wedding, the mothers get to have a special dance with their kids. Poor Chuckie is left out of this. As a result of some events that occurred before the film (a 3-part prequel aired on Nick), Stu, Tommy's father has constructed a giant robotic Reptar for ""EuroReptarland"". As most Stu inventions do, this one malfunctions and he is summoned to fix the machine. What, you believed the Rugrats were going their just for fun? Business must be finished!
So it's off to the city of lights for the Rugrats and their parents. The party stays at a posh hotel located directly in the theme park. CoCo Labaunch, a woman who hates babies and much as Creulla De Vill hates puppies wants to be promoted by the company. The problem is, the boss wants one who loves children, something that CoCo doesn't flow with. Until she meets perennial baby-hater Angelica, she cooks up a plan to win Chas' heart in exchange for a spot as a ""princess"" in the parade. Kira, a single mother who works for CoCo is totally opposite in personality. She is caring, has great voice work, and most importantly nice. She is the link to Chuckie's hope for a new mother. Her daughter, Kimi will probably turn out little more adventurous than Tommy after this film. She really knows the theme park, so the Rugrats do really get loose there thanks to her.
For a movie that takes place in France, it seems that a good portion takes place in the theme park. Places such as the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe (The building featured on the DVD box) are in the climax, locales such as the Loruve is nonexistent. And no cancan dancers? Sounds like ""Rugrats in a Theme Park in Paris-The Movie"". A little UN-historic, but considering the popularity of (Yes, contrary to popular belief, they ARE making money now!) Disneyland Paris, how could they leave out the most popular attraction in Europe out? Speaking of Disney, I was a bit surprised to see many references, obvious and obscure from the Mouse. The infamous attraction ""It's a Small World"" is spoofed as ""Oooey-Gooey World"" which is abundant with green slime. Lady and the Tramp and one lampoon of those numerous singing ballads are examples of this. Since Reptar has always been like Godzilla in the series. The nail-bitting finale features the robotic dino, which are operated by the Rugrats against Robosnail through the streets of Paris. If you thought the dangerous situations in the woods in the first one were intimidating, you ain't seen nothing yet!
In my view, Chuckie was the man for the most part of the film. At times, he was the usual ""Scaredy Cat"", but his neurotic acting never gets old. He will be the unsung hero. Phil and Lil in the first one were very funny. This time, they are very funny and very disgusting. For one, if you are going to see a film with animated babies, expect toilet humor. ""Paris"" is no exception. After years of seeing them mess with foreign items such as worms and navel lint, the two kids outdo their sick selves by grabbing a ""doggie bag"" before leaving. They also mess with the green stuff from the Ooey Gooey ride, eating it and storing it their diapers. I bet you're about to lose your lunch by reading this.
Look for some BIG changes from some characters, especially Angelica and Chuckie. If I told you it, it would defeat the purpose of seeing the movie. As for Kimi, the newest Rugrat on the block really doesn't develop her character in this film. I was hoping this character would be ""the one"" to jump-start the franchise from the horrible episodes that dominated the '98 and '99 season. I guess we will have to wait until 2001 when she will (hopefully) make an impact to the show. Well, she's adorable and her voice is an excellent match.
Despite the usual crude humor and some underdeveloped characters as stated by some braindead critics, ""Rugrats in Paris-The Movie"" is NOT an extended episode. It is really a fun adventure that has a lot more plot and heart than the original. Not only it has it's moments, it does have a few earth-shattering changes from the Rugrats characters. Changes that I really enjoy. Adults (and kids at heart like me) will enjoy (and actually comprehend) it more than that mindless drivel that ""Pokemon"", ""Digimon"" and every other ""mon"" that has been laid before us. After a mediocre slate of unimaginative episodes, it' refreshing to see some changes and intrigue.
As for the DVD, don't expect it to be the greatest one ever, but some of the additions are leauges better than the first Rugrats movie DVD. The alternate endings are pretty bland and the behind the scenes featurette is promo stuff. Hey, at least its anamorphic (DVD-geek speak for ""enhanced for widescreen TV's"", so if you have one, no black bars) with a super clean transfer.",985910400,2,5867,4.67504835589942

1273038,4,B00003CXQ0,"I grew up watching Rugrats and we just recently threw away our old VHS tapes, so finding this movie on DVD was great for me. I didn't like it as much as the first because I'm not much for introducing new characters, but it was still a good movie and worth watching. I rated it four stars because something just wasn't working for me...I'm not quite sure what it was, but in comparison to the first movie this one definitely seems to be lacking a star.

Pros;
-It's Rugrats. These babies kept me entertained for years and I still enjoy watching them.
-Chuckie's ""I Want a Mom"" song is very sweet and sad, and if you're anything like me you'll end up with it stuck in your head after you watch this. Come to think of it I suppose that could also be a con... =P
-Funny. Angelica's Godfather impression will make you laugh, as will several other parts of the movie.
-Touching and relevant storyline. Some children don't have a mom, and Chuckie's struggle to get through that might help them to get through that. Even those children who are lucky enough to have both parents should realize how precious life is. (And just because Chuckie is looking for a new mom doesn't mean he doesn't love his actual one. He went YEARS without one, it isn't as if he's trying to replace her).

Cons;
-The Reptar park could have been anywhere in the world. Besides the accents and the ocassional shot of the Eiffel Tower, there was nothing to show that it was actually in Paris.
-The poodle. I could be wrong but at no point do you actually find out the poodle's name and who owns her. As someone who has seen the show I know, but if you just watch the movie as a standalone thing you might be left wondering. It isn't a big deal, just something that bothered me a bit.

Overall, I like this movie. If you're a fan of the Rugrats, go ahead and buy it before you can't find it anymore. It is a cute movie that will appeal to people of all ages.",1292025600,,1923,4.292011019283747
1273039,5,B00003CXQ0,My kids used to own this and loved it. So glad to have found it here! Very quick delivery and now my kids are watching a movie from their past.,1271289600,,143,3.8
1273040,4,B00003CXQ0,"I, like most of the people commenting here, grew up watching Rugrats since it first came out on TV and I personally still like to watch it to this day as a closet hobbie of mine. That said, my feelings for this movie when I first watched it were good and bad, but overall positive.

To start with the turnoffs, I was surprised a G rated movie had things such as Tommy's diaper falling off and mooning everyone while dancing on top of the record player at his Grandpa's wedding, or Coco's wedding dress being ripped apart and exposing her underwear. I didn't think stuff like that needed to be in there and thought the movie was a little bit grosser than the potty humor found in the regular TV episodes.

I also thought it was a bit of a stretch for the babies to be capable of operating the giant Reptar robot. Though I still was entertained by all the havoc it created by rampaging through town, I just couldn't see how a bunch of infants would be smart enough, let alone be big enough to control it. Sure the movie is made for kids, but even my younger siblings thought that was wierd and didn't make sense.

Now for the good stuff. I thought Klasky Csupo did a good job of integrating pop culture parodies such as Lady and the Tramp, King Kong, and my favorite of all, The God Father. I couldn't stop laughing when I first saw Angelica appear as ""The Bobfather"" (and believe me she fits that role perfectly) or when Dil first drooled all over her hand. The pop culture parodies were one of the things that made the show great in the first place, and in my opinion the writers did a good job of inserting more of it into this movie.

Coco Lebouche also made a pretty good villian. When you love to hate the bad guy in a movie you know they're good and I just loved her coniving manipulative personality. It's always fun to see those kind of villians get what they deserve at the end and she definately got hers (In fact I wish they had kept the alternate ending [one of the bonus features] in which she was stuck working at a deoderant factory and being grossed out by that low life job she was forced to work).

Most importantly of all, this movie has a wonderful family values aspect to it. Chuckie is my favorite character, and I've always felt sorry for him in being the only baby in the group to not have a Mom. So to see him finally get a really good one in Kira Watanabe, as well as a new sister in Kimi was very touching to me. It's this kind of stuff that I wish more cartoons had these days.",1187827200,,2504,4.2301255230125525
1273041,5,B00003CXQ0,"First of all, let me say that I really enjoyed the first film and lets just say that I haven't laughed that hard since the time that I saw that ""Help, Ive fallen and I cant get up!"" commercial, but the second film really is not appropriate for children. There are numerous sexual references and unneeded foul language all commited by children for children. It is obvious that the actor protraying Tommy(the main character) is not a child anymore (when was the last time you hear a baby speaking perfect english, I mean HELLLOO???) and should pass to role on. I am very disappointed with the producers and actors for taking place in this kind of film. Thumbs down big time!",1168041600,,672,4.56198347107438
1273042,5,B00003CXQ0,"Of course, I think this movie is super! The reason I rated it 5 stars is because of the plot. Actually, there were a few plots, like the wedding, giant robots, broken hearts, and lying. That is everything I love. Well, okay, maybe the fact that it's not scary is distressing, because I love horror. But, all in all, it was a great film. I watch it a lot with my mom. The villain, Cocoa, was super. Her plan was to become the president of the whole theme park and, believe me, that was a very important job. The whole reason they had to go to Paris, France was because the gigantic robot, Reptar, had his head blown up, which I think was hilarious. It made a huge mess, and then they had to go all the way to Paris which, believe me, is a long way. But, it really turned into an adventure and here are some things that happened: a crazy woman tried to trick Chuckie's dad into marrying her, and a dog running away, then a wedding, and a gigantic robo-snail which, believe me, is exciting and entertaining. I would have given it about 4 stars, but the plot just had to make one more star. My favorite part was when the whole plot began, but Chuckie knew that he must stop all these weird things from really happening, or his life would be ruined. If you ask me, there was a lot they had to worry about. I mean, they still did fix Reptar, which was important. There are even cool controls that make Reptar move. This was the best Rugrats movie I have seen so far. Believe me, you will want to watch this movie over and over with your family.",1151193600,,1538,4.199324324324325
1273043,5,B00003CXQ0,This was a good film. I liked cocoa the best.(Is that how you spell her name?),1112832000,,78,3.9375
1273103,3,B00003CXQ0,"There are two things that keep this film from being as good as the first one.  Those things are Kimi (horrible character) and elements gone too far out of reach of the ordinary human imagination.

Rugrats fans may like this, but to me this movie only further propelled the downfall of the TV series I grew up watching.  It's no longer one of the favorite shows of my youth, and I can't help but say one of the reasons for it is this movie.

Stu has made a new invention, a Reptar robot that can be used for a play being performed in Paris, France.  He signs the deal and the Rugrats are off to Paris!  And this time Chuckie is getting a mommy.

It's a fun adventure, but by all means it isn't a good one.  A few things about it are just too farfetched.  For example, the parents are downright stupid.  How do you NOT know your kids are missing?  And why would you leave a bunch of toddlers in a hotel room without supervision? Honestly.

Another aspect that sends it on a downhill is the simple fact that some parts just don't feel believable.  The babies end up climbing into Stu's invention and going all over Paris with it.  In this 100 foot Reptar they manage to smash through most of Paris, save Angelica when she is propelled up the Eifle Tower and falls from it.  To me this is an overstretched imagination.  Even babies controlling a giant robot is too far outside the box.

And then there's Kimi.  The new character on the block.  At least unlike Dil she does something, but Kimi has things that annoy me so much more than Dil.  Kimi is an asian baby (with cowboy boots) who is always ready for an adventure.  I don't mind that at all, and I don't even mind that Tommy seems to have a crush on her throughout the film.  What I do mind though, is how perfect she is as a child.  Even Tommy makes mistakes, but Kimi seems to be the know-it-all baby.  As a character she's overall flawed by not having any flaws!  As the character Otacon said in the video game Metal Gear Solid; ""People just aren't complete without some type of character flaw..."" and you know what? He's right!

I'm not trying to be picky, but overall I'd say that the main reason the film didn't work was because of Kimi.  I was a big Rugrats fan in the early 90's and even after Dil came a long I found the strength to keep watching the already flawed television show.  But after Kimi came, that was it; no more Rugrats for me!

A great adventure?  Sure it is.  It's good if your younger than ten.  Even for the older audiences that like the Rugrats this film just can't measure up to what it's worth.  Kimi is a horrible character and the overstretch of imagination with some of the aspects of the film are really stupid.

Good movie?  I would like to think not.  Any kid will be impressed with it, but older people (even those that grew up with the Rugrats like myself) will be horrified by it; even insulted intellecually.",1107043200,5,2901,4.297597042513863
1273104,5,B00003CXQ0,"I love little baby Kimi!! I was so glad when she became one of the Rugrats at the end. She is so cute and so sweet, it would impossible not to like her. She looked really, really cute at the end in that weird robe, yeah!",1093910400,3,220,3.8043478260869565

1273107,4,B00003CXQ0,"Now I remember watching the first ""Rugrats"" movie in almost empty theater, which went totally ignored in Japan, where Nickleodeon's original famous, long-cherished TV series is virtually unknown among Japanese anime productons.  And this  second theatrical offering, after that result, went as a consequence almost unnoticed, given only a very limited theatrical release (and Japanese-dubbed version only).  So, I bought a copy at Amazon, just to listen to the original cast's voice.  Yes, no one can reproduce the voice of wickedly funny Angelica.
The second movie ""Rugrats in Paris"" turned out better than I expected, and probably the first thetrical one.  Adults, let me give you good news, there are less toilet humors that is one of the characteristics of the series.  Well, still there is, but thanks to the producers' wise decision, the focus is given to Chuckie, (comparatively) elder member of the baby gang that go  to Paris with a reason so far-fetched that you might as well forget at all.  Anyway, the point is, the kids in dipers go to an amusement park in Paris, managed single-handedly by a mean, greedy woman Coco (imagine Cruela of ""101"" with-French accent, voiced by Susan Sarandon)  Apparently in the name of love for kids (but with her own hidden agenda), she swears that she is going to marry Chuckie's dad, but before that, her amusement park, and inevitably the city of Paris also has to suffer the greatest wreck since the time of ""Armaggedon.""
The story is nothing but an excuse for those kids' wracky gags, and sometimes the film, even for its short running time, looks as if padded out.  Still, the film goes smoothly (more smoothly than the previous film) and by giving (again comparatively) elder characters more time for spotlight, the film avoids being filled with gross-out laughs though, obviously for younger audience, they are still retained.  One of my favorite moments of the film is when deliciously mean child-devil Angelica reflects: ""Sometime I can't help myself.""  Yeah, that's why you are so lovely.
The only complaint from Japanese audience is that the film, intentionally or not, seems as if confusing Japan and China.  Though names like Tanaka or Yamaguchi are obviously Japanese ones (and Mako, born in Kobe provides for the former), their costumes and manners rather belong to Chinese tradition -- for instance, dragons or gongs -- and this kind of confusion might explain the lukewarm reception on the side of Japanese distributors.  As a matter of fact, the people in both countries are getting too much weary of this kind of mistakes.
These things aside, the film lives up to our standard of animated film today, and if nothing special, ""Rugrats in Paris"" gives you an enjoyable trip to fantasy world with those noisy but lovely child gang from Nickelodeon.",1022112000,,2809,5.0
