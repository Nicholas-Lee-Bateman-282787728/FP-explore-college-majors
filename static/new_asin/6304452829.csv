885737,5,6304452829,"Crackerjack war/anti-war yarn starring Frederic March and Cary Grant as two flying aces in WW I who don't like each other, with events leading to a surprise turn-around for one of them. Despite their antipathy for each other, when they fly together they actually make a good team. March begins to lose his grip on things after some of the pilots are killed and especially after he shoots down the German ace Greentail, only to find out he was just a boy. He delivers a scorching anti-war diatribe after that and then commits suicide. Grant, who recognizes the nobleness of March, refuses to let it be known he died by suicide, so takes him up in his plane, riddles his body with bullets, and makes it look like he was killed in combat. The script is a good one, and the acting is intelligent. Carole Lombard appears briefly as March's love interest (for one night) while on leave in London. The dramatic tension is relieved wonderfully along the way by Jackie Oakie, until he's killed in a mission. And after that the tension builds superbly to the climax. It's a well-done production - definitely worth a watch.",1149552000,,1112,4.649746192893401
885738,5,6304452829,"MCA/Universal is re-releasing the great Stars of early Hollywood Classics.  It is truly great to see these stars in their early careers.
""The Eagle and The Hawk"" - starring A young Fredric March & Cary Grant. (With a cameo of the fabulous Carole Lombard).  This World War I film is a psychological battle of the aerial dog fighting between young men and the lasting effect on these young pilots and observers.
March & Grant are bitter enemies who respect each others professional abilities.  Who team up to become the squadrons best aerial team.  The stress of the job and the constant exposure to death take their toll on our stars.
Excellent protrayal of young men and their experiences in war.
The acting of March & Grant are tops. A brief visit of Carole Lombard eases the pain & sufferings.
This VHS, Standard version is a good copy with an original trailer included.  Enjoy.",1048204800,13,880,4.7254901960784315
885739,4,6304452829,"We've been watching a lot of Fredric March movies in the past several months. It amazes me how many times he appears in uniform. This is one of at least four times in WWI uniform. Anyway.
It was really interesting to see him working with Cary Grant, who plays a former labourer with an attitude. But deep down he has compassion on Fred's character, a former polo player who can't deal with all the killing and death he is witnessing. He thought the war would be a party. The movie shows his progression from a carefree soldier to one who has nightmares and is losing his sanity. Although Cary Grant acts as if he can't stand Fred, in the end he steps in and - well, watch the movie and you'll see.
Jack Oakie plays a loafer at home and a loafer at the front. Occasionally he does fly the airplane, but only once do you see him in the plane - always he's sitting in a wheelbarrow reading ""A Night in a Turkish Harem"", lounging in a bathtub, and so forth.
Carole Lombard had a platinum blonde and overly made up bit part as a trampy-looking woman who shows kindness to Fred when he's on leave. I couldn't really figure out what purpose she played in the movie... kind of strange.
I don't have a lot to say about this movie except that it is really really good, and you should see it by all means.",1032393600,10,1294,4.242914979757085
885740,4,6304452829,"Just this year I have discovered Fredric March, and what a great actor he is. He does not disappoint in ""The Eagle and the Hawk"" either. He plays an ace American flyer in the Royal Flying Corps, who was at first eager to go to war, but once in France and actually participating in the war, he finds that war is not the romantic glamour thing he envisioned it would be. War, he found, is actually killing people. It disturbs him greatly to realize that so many must die, and that he has a part in so many deaths. He begins to slowly lose his grip on his sanity, for none of the other men seem to feel the way he does, about the senslessness of war, of killing young boys just free from their mothers. He is a skilled flyer and earns many medals, but in the end they mean nothing to him, for he earns them by killing, which he cannot stand. The commanding officer grants him 10 days leave to hopefully ""cheer"" him up, but it does not work, for at the party he attends, all people want to talk about is the war; even one woman's young son asks him gory details about planes going down and people dying. It is during the leave that the Carol Lombard character enters the picture. I don't think she was really necessary. I personally felt she wasn't right for the role. I didn't care for her personality, her make-up and hair, and her ridiculous fur coat! But she was there to listen to Fredric talk to himself about the senselessness of war, and he needed to vent, and she was there. I think another woman would have been better, a more naturally beautiful one, one with more naivity and gentleness of spirit. I believe that the scene had much more potential than it was given. Anyway, Fredric goes back to war, and finally cracks up, and kills himself. The Cary Grant character, who was antagonistic toward Fredric March in the whole movie, is kind to him in the end, and makes it so noone knows he lost his sanity, but that instead he died a war hero. I do not know why Fredric March is not on the cover of this video, HE is the star, not Grant or Lombard! I recommend this for a good example of Fredric March's acting. I should mention that his scene where he was having the nightmare of all the people who died was very touching. This isn't a very long movie, so give it a watch, you'll like it.",1031356800,16,2295,4.254004576659039
885741,5,6304452829,"This is a memorable antiwar movie with Fredric March as a reluctant hero, co-pilot Cary Grant, everyone's pal Jack Oakie, and society dame Carole Lombard. Great film.

7872403,5,6304452829,"For those who appreciate earlier movies this is one you do not want to miss. It is really a vehicle for Fredric March. He plays a WWI pilot who finds coping with the war rather difficult.

Carole Lombard has a appearance for a few minutes as a women he meets in London while on leave.

Cary Grant has a smallish role as another pilot.

But it is mostly March, who sinks into the despair the war brings as he kills the enemy and sees those he flies with being killed on a regular basis.

The ending is not pretty, but is fairly powerful in its statement about what war brings to the warriors.",1417996800,,591,4.20353982300885
7872404,5,6304452829,"A bitter anti-war film brilliantly acted by Frederick March.  This is a 1930s film that gives some insight into the powerful American isolationism prior to WW II.  Despite subsequent hype, many Americans felt deeply betrayed by the Wilson Government's lies and distortions that got us involved in ""The War to End All Wars.""  Every nation involved in this pointless and stupid war was desperately wrong, including the nations we eventually allied with.  America, in joining the War, simply joined the coalition of the hopelessly idiotic.  Many Americans, considering our losses during WW I ""balanced"" against the destruction of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Prussian and Russian Empires and the fatal weakening of the French and British Empires along with the rise of Soviet Communism, recognized how futile the whole thing had been--a mass genocide for less than nothing.

March plays a reluctant fighter Ace tormented by his friends who have died and the men he has personally killed.  His soul shattering insight is that it has all been for exactly nothing.",1417392000,,1060,5.236686390532545
7872405,4,6304452829,"A wartime drama of the first World War.  Frederic March gave a strong performance as an ace pilot trying to keep up a brave front while being overwhelmed by the death and brutality of war.  It touched on a fact that few movies of the time did.  It is something that happens to many soldiers in combat.  You want to look brave and heroic on the outside, but inside the stress and guilt of killing people tend to eat away at you.
This film touched on that and March delivered the goods.  Cary Grant did an excellent job as his enemy-friend, that learned to understand him.",1408320000,,570,4.339622641509434
7872406,4,6304452829,"If you're a fan of this well-acted, introspective tribute to WWI aviators (a worthy precursor to '12 O'Clock High' and other great flyer films), know that you needn't settle for an overpriced MOD copy: 'The Eagle and the Hawk' (3 1/2 stars) is also available on a fully mastered disc as part of Universal's '10-Movie War Collection'-- a real bargain containing fine prints of several classics, some never before released on DVD.",1371340800,7,428,4.958333333333333
7872407,4,6304452829,"This movie was a remarkable and pleasant surprise.  The subject matter is sobering, and was dealt with very well.  It showed that Hollywood producers had more than just a romantic view of war, depicting, as carefully as they could back then, the toll that war can take on the soldiers involved.  Nor is it overly patriotic.  Fredric March deserves to share the cover with Grant on the box, though.  But, I realize what it takes to sell a movie.

Mr. Grant's role was well incorporated into the film, with a good balance between he and Fredric March.  A pretty good job by the director, I guess.  And again, not depicting him as an obvious hero, either.  I enjoy seeing Grant in these roles; he seemed to put a lot of effort in whatever he did, even his early films.  Not a lazy actor at all -- very refreshing!

He was soo young and slender! And even in this role, I guess he just couldn't help but look handsome too.  They don't make 'em like that any more!

7872408,5,6304452829,"I found this to be a very good classic movie. Of course, I am also
a Cary Grant fan. This movie had a lot of action, and also
showed respect for your comrades in arms, even if you didn't
especially care for them. Thought it was good overall, and worth
watching. Black and white, of course. It is after all an old movie!",1243209600,,319,4.079365079365079
7872409,4,6304452829,"1930's movies are a hobby for me.  I have seen thousands.  It is obvious that the overwhelming majority were made for one purpose-- to maximize profits.  To do this they were ""designed"" to give the public what it wanted--and still wants, i.e., bigger than life movie stars, a few endlessly repeated popular themes, shamelessly uncomplicated scripts, formula directing.  In the 30's, they were the ultimate mindless escape entertainment for hard times.  For these reasons (and the black and white, 4:3 format), most of my friends think I am wasting my time with these ""old movies.""  I can't really defend myself and don't try.  I am having a good time.

The Eagle and the Hawk is different from what I just described.  It isn't a great, but it is a far better movie than the standard fare today.  Roger's and Miller's screenplay was a thoughtful treatment of one man's struggle with the human wreckage of war.  Stuart Walker's direction captured many of the subtleties of real people doing real things.  The sets were completely believable and the cast well chosen.  The climax was not the inevitable feel-good, tiddying-up of loose ends to keep us happy.  It was ultimately a sad movie.  A statement movie.  You think about it afterwards.  It was a powerful production that owes much to whoever so expertly brought all the pieces together.

Do not, however, go for the illustrations on the VHS box.  Carole Lombard and Cary Grant never share a scene.  In fact, Lombard's part is best described as a cameo, as another reviewer has already said.  Furthermore, Cary Grant's role is minor when compared to Frederich March's.  March is the focal point and does a fabulous job.

There are quite a few other really good and even great movies from the 30's.  Unlike ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""It Happened One Night,"" these often have unrecognizable titles and will remain unknown as long as audiences favor ""modern"" star vehicles, repetitous story lines, etc.",1169683200,14,1949,4.871951219512195
