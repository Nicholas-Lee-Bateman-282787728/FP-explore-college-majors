7957386,3,B00005YR1L,"Andy Sidaris' favorite ""actresses"" Dona Spier and Hope Marie Carlton are back in their best-known roles as undercover models Donna and Taryn in ""Savage Beach"". Let's be honest: if you've seen one Sidaris movie, you've seen them all: there are lots of beautiful women, guns, explosions, confusingly convoluted plots, and amazingly improbably coincidences aplenty. There is nothing subtle about any of these films, but I'm sure they make a lot of money so there are a lot of them.

""Savage Beach"" contains an extremely muddled plot that is irrelevant to the film anyway (most viewers just want to see the girls and guns), but this installment contains the most eye-rolling coincidence in any Sidaris movie, and perhaps in all cinema history. It's 1989 and the girls still work as pilots for Molokai Cargo as pilots. The film opens with Donna busting a heroin smuggling operation wide open amid much gunplay (the drugs were in hollowed out pineapples) all within the first five minutes of the film. Two minutes later the girls and two other Playboy veteran friends are in the Jacuzzi discussing their day. Suddenly there is an emergency in the Marshall Islands! A children's hospital needs some special serum delivered to save the children during a huge storm. Ace pilots Donna and Taryn and their trusty Cessna 172 are dispatched. Since they are flying vaccine across the Pacific they need to be fully armed, and they get guns and a crossbow with an explosive arrow. I wonder if that will need to be used later on? None of this is within the laws of reason but, hey, it's an Andy Sidaris movie.

Providing a thread of continuity to earlier installments, Shane Abilene (Michael Shane) is the male lead in this one. Like all the other films in the Sidaris universe, this one contains lots of innuendo and romantic banter, and in this one the interpersonal dialogue is extra cringeworthy. Also like other Sidaris films the confusing backstory swings into gear with some kooky military and CIA hijinks involving a smarmy revolutionary from the Philippines and stolen data from a ""Star Wars"" satellite (remember when this was made for what little historical context is relevant). The plot pivots to be about a sunken Japanese ship from World War Two that contains gold stolen from the Philippine people, and now everyone wants to get rich.

Japanese agents interrogate an old Japanese Admiral who tells them the story of the theft and the boat's sinking on his deathbed: he wants to return the gold to the Philippines because he's noble. All the Japanese here speak amazingly good unaccented English, by the way. Meanwhile, the girls deliver the serum, refuel and leave without so much as a bathroom break (I'm going to point out that the alleged 1,500 mile journey would take about 14 hours one way in a Cessna 172, so they must have bladders of steel.) Once airborne the girls put the aircraft on autopilot to change out of their wet clothes. (Yeah.) Of course the plane gets hit by lightning, knocking out all their instruments and they have to make a forced landing on an uncharted desert isle. While all that's going on, everyone is converging on a small island where the Japanese boat foundered in 1943. Where do you think the girls just happened to land? You may think that's the most ridiculous coincidence in the plot but you would be oh so wrong.

The girls settle in to their amazingly well-equipped survival routine with wetsuits and spear guns for fishing. Donna uses a sextant to figure their position (I cannot stress how hilarious this is) while Taryn goes to the plane to get a blanket because Donna ""has a chill""...when it's 100 degrees in the shade. The island is inhabited (no surprise). Taryn said when they landed it felt very familiar to her; she also told a story about how her grandfather had died in World War Two in the Pacific. The girls take their survival assault rifles to hunt the other inhabitant and find it's an old Japanese guy who was a soldier in the war and who has been living by himself on the island for 50-something years. He has a ceremonial sword, but refuses to kill Taryn, leading to the most outrageous coincidence in movie history. He doesn't kill her because of the foreshadowing. Nothing goes to waste in a Sidaris movie, and in this case the Japanese soldier had found three Americans who had crashed their plane; they killed and buried the Americans, but the Japanese guy recognized Taryn because of her eyes that looked just like her grandfather's. He even kept his dog tags and a photo of him for all these years. I gave the film three stars solely on the absolute hilarious absurdity of this coincidence. In the end the Japanese guy kills a bad guy to protect Taryn while he gets mortally wounded, thus completing the circle of life as he dies in Taryn's arms. Perfect. In the end all the good guys reveal their true identities, motives, and employers and go dancing to celebrate. Taryn even managed to take six gold bars from the loot as a finder's fee. She's so clever.

This, like other Sidaris movies, is beautifully shot and has nice scenery, but the script is only modestly coherent (I'm being generous) and the acting is appalling. Having said that, if you elected to watch a movie called ""Savage Beach"" and especially if you have ever seen an Andy Sidaris production before, you'll know exactly what it is all about: girls, guns, and exploding things. This delivers all that in spades and then some.",1469318400,,5456,4.757127771911299

In fact, Andy Sidaris cleverly disguised the location to look like some tropical island in the Caribbean.  But don't be fooled, that's Fort Wayne you're looking at.  Lastly, the hotties!  The women are not from Fort Wayne--thank goodness.  Silicon free, these women are 100% natural.

7957392,3,B00005YR1L,"Andy Sidaris!  Guns and explosions!  Random nudity!  All-synonymous.  I purchased this movie because it is the prequel to ""Return to Savage Beach"" which was, in my opinion, the best T&A movie that I have EVER seen up to this date.  And if you don't know what T&A stands for than you are unfamiliar with the genre, and I therefore do NOT recommend ANY Andy Sidaris films to you.  ""Savage Beach"" pales in comparisons when it comes to the babes in the movie.  For bouncy silicone lovers, the sequel, Return to Savage Beach would definitely be a more satisfying choice.  What you see on the cover is what you get with the original ""Savage Beach.""  Two avergage looking blondes, scantily clad, packing serious heat.  I give it 3 stars out of 5 because if you are even considering this film, than you're certainly not looking for much more than what you see on a cover.  And in that case, this film does deliver, and even goes slightly beyond.  It is cheesy (as expected) but comical.  There is even something that ALMOST mildly resembles a plot, which was a surprising bonus to this film.  ""Savage Beach"" is good for a B-rate, C-cup, Sidaris flick.  But it does lack the much better looking, super double D-cup (and beyond), silicone laced, higer polished models featured in its sequel.",1064448000,2,1281,4.65625
7957393,5,B00005YR1L,"Nobody will ever accuse writer/director/producer Andy Sidaris of delving into the the realm of film noir. Sidaris's films are all lighthearted romps by beautiful people through sunlit locations and improbable circumstances involving bullets, bombs and babes. Andy Sidaris is the Spielberg of T&A, and his movies are just good, plain fun.
In ""Savage Beach,"" secret agents Donna Hamilton (Playmate Dona Spier) and Taryn Kendall (Playmate Hope Marie Carlton) reprise their roles from ""Hard Ticket to Hawaii."" This time, the two sexy superspies are stranded on an uncharted Pacific Island, which, a la ""Gilligan's Island"" is suddenly overrun by brawny, testosterone-choked males who are searching for some treasure left there by the Japanese during World War II. When not changing out of their wet things, or skinny dipping in the gentle surf, Donna and Taryn are locked in a life-or-death struggle to survive ninety-odd minutes of light bondage, ogling, and baldfaced sexual innuendo, punctuated by random gunfire and explosions. Taryn's incendiary crossbow is a nice tip of the hat to James Bond. ""Q"" never had it so good as Hope Marie makes it.
Although his scriptwriting leaves something to be desired (like a real plot), Sidaris's production values are excellent even when his actors and actresses don't and can't. Hope Marie and Dona really try to remember their lines. They are so likeable and so incredibly attractive, and so obviously having fun in this goofy picture that anyone who is in a serious state of mind is advised to take his raincloud elsewhere.
This newly-released Special Edition DVD includes trailers from other Sidaris films, an introduction by Andy and Penthouse Pet Julie Strain, and a segment of the ""Andy Sidaris Film School,"" in which Andy dissects the technical aspects of moviemaking using his own films as material. Anyone who is interested in filmmmaking should watch this segment as it is informative and intelligent, and clearly shows that despite the ""B"" genre of Andy's films, he is both thoughtful and professional.
It's fun. Pure fun. Enjoy!",1034208000,12,2077,5.221556886227545
