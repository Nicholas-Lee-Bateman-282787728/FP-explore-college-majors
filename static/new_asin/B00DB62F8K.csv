5786937,3,B00DB62F8K,"Although This DVD Zeppelin concert has a low quality image and sound, it results interesting by the material that the band plays on stage. It's not easy to play more than three hours but they did very well. It's true that the listening of the voice of Robert Plant is something eroded and rough but the emotion is still there and the musical skills of Jimmy Page, John Paul Johns and John Bonham are really great, so enjoy the music... The music programme is:

Rock & Roll, Sick Again, Over The Hills And Far Away, In My Time Of Dying, The Song Remains The Same, The Rain Song, Kashmir, No Quarter, Tangerine, the acoustic set: Going To California, That's The Way, and Bron-Y-Aur Stomp; Trampled Underfoot, Moby Dick, Dazed & Confused, Stairway To Heaven, Whole Lotta Love, Black Dog. ...Good Luck!",1175558400,,798,4.659574468085107
5786938,5,B00DB62F8K,This DVD illustrates the fact that the Mighty Zeppelin had reached their pinnicle of musical status. Everything after that year of 1975 just added much more to their grandeur. They were indeed one of the greatest musical group that came out of the U.K.,1367625600,,252,4.75
5786939,4,B00DB62F8K,Its great to see these rocks god in action. The audio and video is not very good. Best to get the Zep from 2003. Its nice to see though. Wish they would re-mix this.,1359331200,,165,3.8823529411764706
5786940,1,B00DB62F8K,"After my purchase, it was clear that this was a burned copy and put in the garbage pile but listed by the seller as Used-Like new. I have watched parts of this concert on youtube and it is a great. If you can find a legit copy with good sound, it would be worth every penny otherwise avoid it and save yourself the aggravation. As a Zeppelin fan when a legit copy is made, I'll be first in line to buy. I suggest you write to any seller to ask whether it's a cheap burned version or the real deal.",1353801600,19,497,3.98
5786941,5,B00DB62F8K,"Hory Shit this is a very cool Video !! Audio & Video is Good Quality considering it's 1975. Great to see some great footage of One of the Greatest Bands in the History of Rock N' Roll !!!

Highly Recommend This Video !!!!",1352505600,,221,4.1395348837209305
5786942,1,B00DB62F8K,Sound quality is atrocious. Buy the Led Zeppelin DVD that has the portion of Earls Court. Avoid this one. Not worth the price.,1351900800,14,126,4.521739130434782
5786943,5,B00DB62F8K,"Well, here it is.
  I never had a chance to see Led Zeppelin live. In the movie The Song Remains The Same you just don't get a felling for the interaction between members of the band itself, as well as the band and the audience. It's too stiff.
  I'm not a kid, I first heard Led Zeppelin 1 the week it came out when I was ten and they immediately became my favorite band.

  The one piece of the puzzle that always alluded me was not being able to see them live and to feel their presence, and to see what all the fuss was about, a live show. You just don't get that in little snippets from You Tube or a photograph. Those only tell you a part of the story.

  Led Zeppelin is a band of warriors that leave it all on field so to speak. Or stage if you like. They lived their lives in the open and they live their lives on stage. It was all won or lost on stage. That was life for them, that is what they lived for.

  If you are able, that is, are of a certain mind and spirit they will engage you and you will have a dialog with them. And you will see that dialog acted out among themselves, and you, and the audience. And it's funny.

  Knebworth is great example of this as well. But that show has a life and a plot of it's own. It's quite a different story.
  I encourage anyone reading this to first watch The Earl's Court Show and let it all sink in. Then shortly after watch Knebworth. The dialog that exists between them and you will be different.

  Of course none of that will work unless you have the ability to live in that moment, forget about the clown show that followed them wherever they went, and forget about what you know will happen. And just watch.

  You've heard the saying ""The Golden Age of Movies"" and ""The Golden Age of TV"" and ""The Golden Age of Rock and Roll.""
  Earl's Court is a fine example of the Golden Age of Led Zeppelin, live.",1347753600,9,1865,4.054945054945055
5786944,5,B00DB62F8K,"I was there, I was 20 years old living in England, my husband was stationed at RAF Lakenheath.  We were young and stupid then but damm, what a show.  We were in another world that night, thinking we were in the US and when it said the last train was at 10:30, we all blew it off not even worrying about it.  Well, the show ran late, we missed our train and had no idea the name of the station where we left our car more than an hour out of London.  We had $12 to our name, no clue how to get to our car and by this time it was 1am.  Lucky for us, I went in to this hole in the wall taxi place and the guy felt sorry for us and took us all the way.  Lucky, right?  Yea I know. But Led Zeppelin rocked our world that night.  The laser light show was something we had never seen before, purple light beams shooting off of their guitars into the crowd.  We had no drugs but you would never have know that! (lol) Hey, Im from the 60's what can I say.",1305072000,14,945,3.7806122448979593
5786945,2,B00DB62F8K,"I've just seen it for five minutes ago, an I can only say, It was funny to look at. I bought it In Denmark for 25 kr., the same as about 5$. If I had bought it for nearly 12 it would probably had been near as funny to look at.

I give The Blob ""fishtrunx right in many of the thinks he's saying! One of them is If you're looking after proper sound and videomix, you should go after something else.  And as J. DiMattia say, they could have been in better shape, but there is definitely very good moments.

....But I think it's funny to look at and I got myself some laughs and smiles, so those 25 kr. is probably the best investment of the day.

When I vote, I will think of it, as I bought it for full prize :-)

I'm so sorry, but I can't give this more than two stars. I never thought I would give something with Led Zeppelin on it, that kind of rate...but still, it's a bootleg, big time bootleg and I don't think Page, Plant or Jonsey have had anything to say when this material first time saw it's days on DVD!",1177027200,,1014,3.9753694581280787
5786946,2,B00DB62F8K,"First of all, i do love the band and have listened to many hours of their bootlegs over the last 32 years but, i'm not deaf and know they were the slackest as well as the most exciting band i've heard.
This is a bootleg and therefore shouldn't even be on this site. The sound or the footage hasn't been cleaned up professionaly for an official release.
It's not a great show for Plant's vocals - at least on the electric numbers. For the people that are deaf, Plant lost his ""great"" voice after march '72. He has struggled ever since to keep his voice from breaking but can still blow your mind on a good night.
Bonham puts in a solid performance but his health wasn't the best in this period and his energy level is down compared to the shows just 2 months beforehand in the USA.
Page was better in the USA as well. His playing here is patchy and erratic but still blitzes in small sections. His overall ability was still there but a ""problem"" was starting to emerge from this point onwards.
Jones was always the most professional player in the band and his performance here stands out amongst the others.
Overall, items like these coming out are what collectors sweat on and i'm one of them. But seriously folks, my friends that love ""studio"" & some ""live"" zeppelin just plainly don't like this.
Amazon needs to take bootlegs off their site as they are not officially released by the bands for a good reason. Selling these items to a casual fan can be disappointing to the fan and damaging to the band's reputation as they are not in 5* form. Unfortunately in Led Zeppelin's case, there isn't much pro-shot stuff around. And worse still, most of the official stuff out there isn't from their better performances. Listen to the bootlegs up to march '72 and you'll know what i mean. This isn't a bad dvd, Seattle '77 is - stay far away from that one!!",1176336000,5,1851,4.431085043988269
5786947,1,B00DB62F8K,"Words cannot begin to express how upsetting this purchase has been, if it were possible to rate products with negative stars, I would.  To start, I am the biggest Led Zeppelin fan I know.  I have collected the entire catalog, live and studio, own the 2003 DVD and The Song Remains The Same, I've read a few biographies, and watch and listen to them more than any other band.  However, I would like to warn anybody interested in Zeppelin to stay away from this DVD, don't even consider buying it if you are a completist like myself.  Earl's Court 1975 was an incredible show and was captured brilliantly in the 2003 DVD, but this copy is a travesty.  The audio/video quality of this DVD is horrific and does not come close to doing justice to the greatest band in the history of music.  Yes, there are four more tracks here than on the previous release, but the unforgivably low value is devestating to the viewer.  Do not make the same mistake I made, stop reading this and go order one of the other two aforementioned concert films.  This DVD almost brings me to tears with its pitiful presentation of, again, the greatest band ever (if anyone disagrees with the status-greatest ever- I will gladly destroy them).  For new or die-hard fans alike, I strongly recommend anything but this DVD.  Thanks for reading, and remember, DO NOT order Live at Earl's Court 1975.  In this case, ""import"" means ""bootleg"", and a bad one at that.",1176336000,3,1430,4.590551181102362
8591163,1,B00DB62F8K,"Visual quality was horrible. I know they didn't have all of the technology in the 70's like the technology we have today. Everything was blurry.  Now the sound quality is s**t. When they are playing in my time of dying, when Robert sings, you can't even here Page, Bonham, and Jones. I thought I was getting something great but it sucks, good vintage collectors item, but not good for watching or listening to.  Oh, and another thing when they send the dvd, it comes in a plastic slip, that fits the dvd. SAVE THAT PLASTIC SLIP. The case doesn't even stay closed, it is annoying as hell. One more final thing is the dvd case, the setlist that they present on the back of the case is incorrect. It's says that they play the crunge but they don't. They play going to california, but it doesn't show that on the case. And by the way going to California looks terrible.",1454630400,2,865,4.4

the performance(s).

8591169,5,B00DB62F8K,"After conquering the World Led Zeppelins triumphant return home for a victory lap is delayed as they are forced into tax exile. As a result, the perfect storm empowers arguably the bands most inspired and anticipated live performance ever!

This was also the only 1975 show to feature an acoustic set.

This historical value of this document is priceless, the band, the fans, the critics, most agree that this was the crowning moment of their record breaking tour. The variable in this equation is the quality of this specific transfer, and to that I cannot directly attest. I can only say that if you find a good quality version of this particular concert  it is well worth having.

Converting PAL (European) to NTSC (North American) video standards used to be very difficult and expensive in the early 1990's when the masters first became ""liberated"". As a result, some early copies (and their subsequent reissues) are of horrendous quality. That said, there are also some more recent low gen versions that look and sound STUNNING.
