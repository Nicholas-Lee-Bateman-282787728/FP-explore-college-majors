4401415,5,B004LIYF76,"Although I have no intention of  counting one's chickens before they've hatched, at least I could say it's exactly a good thing that Bandai Ent. is finally launching this highly anticipated series on Blu-rays.

The problem here is apparently someone messed up the Product Details above.  It says only Japanese audio is available while it also saying this title is dubbed, and 66 minutes running time is too short to hold even three episodes.

As I checked with the manufacture's web site, this title has English dub as well as the original Japanese audio with the English subs. It also says the volume #1 is to contain the first four episodes of the series.

I gave 5 stars based upon that information. However, I still strongly recommend you to be cautious before you order this item (If it contains only three episodes, 4 stars at best).",1299110400,21,839,4.719178082191781
4401416,3,B004LIYF76,"First I have to start with saying K-On is one of the best anime I watched in a long time. I am not going to go into further description of the anime itself, as you can find that on other sites.

What I wanted to point out is K-On Volume 1 only has the four episodes on it. So depending on how many volumes Bandai chooses to use, likely four for the 14 episodes (maybe three if they compress the video), you are going to have to pay $140 without any discounts. Even with the best discounts you are still looking at $80+ for the series. I personally find that too high compared to other companies Blu-ray sets, and would like to make sure you have advanced warning.

If that is not an issue for you, then I think you will enjoy this release barring Bandai messing up the encode, which they are not known for.",1297900800,15,806,4.160256410256411
4401417,5,B004LIYF76,This is a perfect show for people ages from 15-30.  If you loved Azumanga Daioh then you are going to love this show.,1308528000,3,117,4.086956521739131
4401418,3,B004LIYF76,"This is the kind of show where you can sum up the story in a few sentences at most, and with these 4 episodes, comes accross as rather average at best.

Basically this is a story about Yui, who has little to no real life talents, she gets drawn into a music club, must get an instrument, and everything else is basically just random slice of life elements.

Although I get that this series is popular, it doesn't really have much, if any depth beyond the whole moe thing that shows like Lucky Star(Also created by the same people as K-On) have.

If you want a random slice of life show which apparently is deep because it has music lol, this is a show for you, however if you want something perhaps with more of a story, you might want to look elsewhere.

I pretty much think of this show as Lucky Star with a musical tone.",1308355200,2,823,4.222929936305732
4401419,1,B004LIYF76,i bought the blu ray only to discover its region locked! it doesn't say it in the description! WTF amazon?,1306108800,3,106,4.35
4401420,3,B004LIYF76,"K-On! is the first of two anime series based on Kakifly's seinen (young men) manga (which means its primary audience is males aged 18-30, not young girls as the amazon.com editorial review above would have you believe - although that demographic would certainly also enjoy K-On!). The show follows the everyday life of four high school girls who decide to revive their school's light music club and form a band. From that point on, they spend most of their time goofing off.

This first volume (there will be four in all) contains the first four episodes in which the group 1) first meet each other, 2) help a member procure an instrument, 3) struggle with mid-term exams and 4) have a training camp at the beach.

Since it first aired in 2009, K-On! has reached immense popularity among anime fans and it's a shame to see that Bandai Entertainment's domestic release is something of a disappointment. The release has a number of flaws, the most significant one being the as-of-yet unexplained music replacement in the first episode, where an instrumental piece performed by the characters has been replaced by an altogether different tune. Add to that the complete lack of any of the bonus materials included in the Japanese release and the fact that they went with lossy Dolby Digital audio instead of lossless for the Blu-Ray, and the disappointments begin to add up. Thankfully, the video quality is stellar. One thing I can't really fault Bandai for is the decision to release the series spread across four individual volumes as opposed to a complete series box set. The license for K-On! was no doubt hellishly expensive, and they need to make their money back somehow. And besides, at the very least it is still dirt cheap compared to the Japanese release!

The only notable extra on this disc is a video interview with a member of the American dub cast. If you're a dub fan, you might find this interesting. The English dub itself is, while no masterpiece, at least pretty good for what it is. You can tell they went to great lengths to do justice to the original - not an easy task considering the original set of characters is probably one of the most iconic casts to emerge from anime within the last couple of years. With the English dub being what it is - an imitation - it's never going to be as good as the original, but it is a decent attempt and should be appreciated by those with an aversion to reading subtitles.

All in all, despite being an imperfect release, I will still recommend it to anyone with an interest in this type of anime. From the get-go, it's good, charming fun and it is only going to get better from here.",1304726400,41,2644,4.6191489361702125
4401421,4,B004LIYF76,"Kyoto Animation has a track record of producing titles that go on to become mega-hit franchises. Haruhi, Lucky Star or their multitude of adaptations of Key's visual novels; no matter what they put out, odds are it'll go on to become a hit. But on top of that, they've historically struck an emotional chord with their excellent scripts, and wowed audiences with their lavish animation. K-On!, an adaptation of Kakifly's 4-panel manga series, is their most recent hit series. With such a pedigree to compete with, does this simplistic tale of a high school band rise to the levels of greatness seen by the studio's works, or fall into the trappings of other slice-of-life moe series? The answer is more mixed than you might think.

We join the protagonists as they all descend on a high school group known as the Light Music Club. On the verge of being disbanded, this club's intention is to make music that is enjoyable and pleasing to the ears. But the only problem is that, despite the fact that three of the four are well-versed in music and can indeed play instruments, they're... just ""not very good"", according to the group's guitarist. She's in no position to speak though, because she can't even play guitar yet. Yes, with this type of dysfunction, on top of school exams, summer trips and other hindrances, the future of the Light Music Club is uncertain.

Their comedic struggles, though, provide a nice four episodes' worth of entertainment in this first volume, however vanilla it may be. These episodes start with each character confused as to what exactly this club's intention is, and end with them having formed a bond and set in motion a solid plan to perform at the school festival. Nothing too challenging in terms of content, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.

This series' main strength lies not in it's plot, though, but in the tone that the writers set. As a reader of the original manga, I have to say that KyoAni did a better job of establishing these characters than their own creator did. Despite the fact that shy rich girl, keyboardist and excellent cook Tsumugi feels like a carbon copy of Miyuki Takara minus the irony, these characters feel like real people that you'd meet in your day-to-day life. Any viewer of Lucky Star can attest to the fact that this studio's storytelling specialty lies in the field of believable characters, but this time, I have to say they've done a better job than in their previous works. I was sucked into these characters' chemistry, and was frequently reminded of my relationship with my own friends. This attention of detail to personality really puts K-On! ahead of so many imitators.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the plot. While it is fun to watch these characters go about their day-to-day affairs, the fact remains that many of these affairs are typical things we've come to expect from this type of show. Beach trips to the rich girl's summer home, shopping trips which include a montage of looking a pretty/cute/fun things, the very concept of forming a dysfunctional club that gets into comedic incidents... these are all things we've seen before. It doesn't make the show any less enjoyable, but those expecting a total deviation in formula from Lucky Star-type shows might feel a bit disappointed.

But to those expecting KyoAni to hold up their excellent quality of animation, prepare yourself for one of the best demonstrations of their work. This could perhaps be the most attention to detail they've paid to a series since the first season of Haruhi. Every piece of background art, every ripple of the characters' clothing, and every movement of the characters themselves are all delivered to us in painstaking detail. This is the type of stuff that only KyoAni's budget can achieve, and it's damn beautiful to look at. While what they're showing us isn't exactly fantastical, the studio proves that paying attention to your everyday surroundings may reap more rewards than immersing yourself in imaginary worlds.

The voice-acting is top-notch as well. KyoAni's past megahits have boasted fantastic casts (in both their English dubs and original Japanese voice tracks), and this show is no different. Especially great are Stephanie Sheh and Aki Toyosaki as Yui, the ditz of a lead guitarist whose personality shifts every 0.5 seconds. Both actresses convey a perfect sense of ADD when voicing this fragile girl, one rarely achieved by V.A.s when voicing this type of character. Not to take away from the rest of the cast; everybody here is on their A-game.

Hajime Hyokkoku's score is the tidy ribbon which wraps up this neat package. Encompassing a wide range of musical styles (rock, pop, orchestral, techno, synthpop, etc.), this man has come a long way from his Voogie's Angel days (five points to anybody who'd heard of that series before having to look it up in the link!). This should cement into the realm of top-notch composers of mainstream anime.

Bandai USA's American release of the show is fairly bare-bones, but that can be forgiven considering it's just not feasible to release the limited edition versions we saw of Haruhi and Lucky Star (whose last volume didn't even get a limited edition release because of then-collapsing anime DVD industry.) There's an entertaining interview with Stephanie Sheh, and a handful of trailers, but nothing too special. If you have a Blu-Ray player, though, getting this show on that format would be your best bet to appreciate the animation in it's highest quality.

K-On! isn't KyoAni's best work, not by a long shot. But their most polished? Definitely. It doesn't reach the depths of Haruhi, nor the emotional highs of Air, but sometimes, we all just want to relax with some shiny fluff. That's exactly what this show is, and that's why I love it.

4401422,2,B004LIYF76,"Its hard to not give this DVD a 1 star. While I've never taken myself for an uptight purest when it comes to anime (other than DBZ), I have to say this realease was bad.

The voice acting was actually pretty damn good in my opinion. However, I feel that most of them end up sounding alike as you keep watching. Makes it tough to identify them as individuals. I feel they have more character in Japanese, because their voices are simply more unique and different from another. In this only Yui's voice is drastically different. Mio, Ritsu and Mugi all sound good, but nothing really unique.. especially between Mio and Mugi. I feel they were going too hard for a ""soft"" voice cast.

All in all the dub is good and not my gripe. My gripe, is that in the first episode while performing for Yui to convince her to join K-on, Bandai changed the song. The original was Tsubasa Wo Kudasai cover, a legendary song all around the world. I understand it may have to do with license issues, but I'm sure they could've kept it if they were anything less than ""lazy"" in this production. I understand cutting such corners helps the wallet, and most English speakers may not be familiar with the song, but its a pretty big scene for fans of the series.

Not to mention, other studios have had the song in their releases, no problems whatsoever. Like Evangelion 2.22, which has the song cover by Megumi as the final battle's theme.

Honestly speaking, the Tsubasa wo Kudsasai cover in the first epsidoe is one of my favorite K-on moments, if not my favorite altogether. and it was the moment I was most looking forward to watching when I bought the DVD. Then it began, and I was shocked. The replacing song is not even attempting to sound similar either.. they could have at least took the original song and changed some notes to give you a familiar vibe.

Although when Yui says ""you guys aren't that good"", the line feels much more fitting now that they put that terrible replacement song insert.",1303948800,12,1982,4.50974930362117

We can watch K-ON in Japan ver.
But Japanese blu-ray disc is very high price that is over $100.

4401426,3,B004LIYF76,"I've been looking forward to the English dub of K-on! for a couple years now, as it's one of my favorite animes.  But $35 for 4 episodes?  Are you kidding, forget it!  This is a real step backwards, because most anime sets issued in the last 3 years have packaged at least 13 episodes together, and sometimes 26 in one box.  I can buy a whole 13 episode season of many other good animes for $35!  I really don't understand why they are releasing it this way.  You would have to be a really hard core K-on! fan, or have lots of money to burn, to buy packages like this.  I'm sure after all is said and done they will release a big box containing both seasons, so I guess I might just have to wait for that...

It's a great anime, though.  Actually, it should have had an English dub a couple years ago.",1301702400,6,801,4.116129032258065

It's just the first four episodes. The subtitles are an ugly yellow color and are positioned a bit strangely, but that is common for the blurays i have bought. If this is your first time seeing the show I recommend just watching it on 9anime where they have most of the episodes in 1080p, but if you love this show as much as i do then you want blurays for more sentimental reasons.",1518480000,,543,4.3861386138613865

The show will never fail to bring a smile to your face, and is one of the few shows that can truly making you laugh out loud. Excellent animation quality and great art style.

I'm usually a fan of dubbed animes, but would actually recommend watching the sub for this. It's not that the english voices are bad, but after viewing the series with the original cast, the voices just seem to fit so much better with the energy they bring. If you hate subs, then the dub will still be fine, I'm sure you'll love these characters after the very first episode.",1403049600,,659,4.446280991735537

It's funny and lighthearted and not boring, which is hard to find since pleasing adults and children is not an easy balance to pull.

I can recommend this for parent who like anime and want something to watch with their kids. Its good enough that it can get other audiences but that's the reason I liked it.",1391904000,4,652,4.133858267716535

8434423,5,B004LIYF76,"K-on! Volume 1 Review
The first volume of this show does give a nice and entertaining take on the manga by Kakifly.
On Bluray the quality is stunning crisp and clear nice step up from the im sure great DVD resolution, I found the songs in the opening and closing to be fun and rather cute.
Now comes to the meat to some fans, the English dub suites the needs well for those of us (myself included) who cant always look at the screen to read subtitles or a lack of know how to speak Japanese.
While Yui's voice is a bit high at times it still works well, the VAs of Ritsu, Mio and Tsumugi DO fit their characters well. Some can argue that the voices `don't fit' and that it is fundamentally `better' in the original language. However do keep in mind the company didn't HAVE to bring this great series over.
I have noticed they have chosen to go for American Dollars over Japanese Yen, Yui's Guitar cost
250,000 Yen, yet Mio says $2,500, this isn't too large a deterrent however but a nice nod to those that can't get conversions.
Overall however I am impressed with this anime, nice packaging good quality. If you're a fan of the original manga or just want something cute, give this a go.",1336003200,,1188,4.331838565022421
8434424,5,B004LIYF76,"I bought the blu-ray of the volumes 1 & 2 of K-on! in Australia - distributed by Madman. With each blu-ray you get four episodes, an interview with one of the English dub cast and some trailers. Not really enough, in my opinion, but I can live with it (I'll have to, won't I? ;- The entire running time is 100 minutes which isn't exactly great, especially for a blu-ray DVD.

The first four episodes of volume one largely sets the scene and introduces the characters. We meet four girls: klutzy Yui (guitar), the introspective Mio (bass guitar), sweet-as-apple-pie Mugi (keyboards) and the slightly demented Ritsu (on drums). As you've gathered, the girls form a Rock band at high school in their ""Light Music Club"". We also meet Yui's friend, Yui's very responsible and together younger sister and their outwardly sweet female music teacher who is actually a bit of a renigade. In volume 2 we learn that Mugi is in love with her.

The show has some fun and laughs and it all good natured. It isn't anything ""earth shattering"", but it is a pleasant series to watch and I will buy the other volumes as they're released in Australia.

I like K-on!, there is much to enjoy in the series, especially the incredible look of the animation - which is especially vivid on blu-ray, but I will return to my old favourite, ""Azumanga Daioh"", which still has me ROTFLMAO!
