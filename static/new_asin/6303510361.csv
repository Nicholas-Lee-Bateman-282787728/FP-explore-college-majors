681314,5,6303510361,"I haven't seen the remakes of this film to be able to compare them, but I do know that the basic story of this film has been used over and over in movie history, and that's because it's a good one.  The plot follows the  rise of a young actress and the fall of her actor-husband.  Fredric March  is excellent as the husband who turns to the bottle for comfort when his  career flounders and his star dims.  Janet Gaynor, as the star that is  born, plays her role expressively, no doubt influenced by her days in  silent films, but it works and anchors the film.  Lionel Stander is great  as a cynical studio man. There are a number of terrific scenes, including  several surrounding the new actress' makeover (name and looks) which gives  the viewer an idea of how the studio system must have worked in the Golden  Age.  The final scene is also a classic.  A Star is Born is well scripted  and acted, and it opens the door into Hollywood of the Thirties.",952732800,4,954,4.3352272727272725
681315,5,6303510361,"Having been in public domain for so long now, it seems everyone has put out a print of this movie on video. They are consistently poor quality issues. This DVD issue is not perfect by any means, but it far exceeds any others I've seen. If ever a film was in need of a full restoration this is it. A great movie about that land of hopes and dreams called Hollywood. Honest, realistic, touching, and tragic. Although Judy Garland's version is excellent this is the version that truly delivers. I won't even mention the Streisand remake.",935625600,5,534,4.572916666666667

681403,5,6303510361,"This is probably my all-time favorite movie.

First, I should mention there are 3 different films with the same title. The 1937 version, starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, is the one I'm reviewing. The 1954 film, starring Judy Garland and James Mason, and the 1976 film starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson are both musicals, while the 1937 film is a drama. I found both musical versions disappointing compared to the 1937 version.

The 1937 version, as other Amazon customers have mentioned, is truly a classic, in the best sense of that word. There is a sense of ""freshness"" about it that you only experience in the best of films. I'm happy that other Amazon customers have appreciated the movie as much as I have and have extolled many of its virtues. I'll only add one more virtue to that list: excellent editing. The pacing of the movie is flawless. There is never a wasted moment. Every scene contributes to the forward progression of the story. How many movies can one say that about? And yet, I never felt it was rushed.

I must confess that none of my friends I've recommended the movie to were as enamored of it as I was. So I thought I'd first mention things about the film which might not be appreciated by some viewers.

First of all, the film is definitely a tragedy. Even I must admit the Academy Awards scene is truly painful to watch. But the movie is not an unrelenting downer. There are comic interludes and scenes of optimistic enthusiasm. And I found the final scene at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre uplifting and redeeming.

Second, admittedly (and embarrassingly), the movie does contain some ""corn"". This includes every scene with Andy Devine in it, and some of Janet Gaynor's naivete comes across that way too. But I take the corn as an artifact of its time and a small price to pay for the movie's many positive virtues.

Third, one of my friends thought the movie was ""overacted"". There is some truth to that. I thought that Janet Gaynor's ""overacting"", such as her less-than-subtle facial expressions, might have been the result of her earlier silent film career, where such overacting might have been necessary. But it works. The viewer can't help but empathize with Janet Gaynor's character.

Now, to the quality of the numerous transfers. Being my all-time favorite movie, I've bought many VHS and DVD versions of the film. (I assume it is in the public domain.). The best transfers, for which I've awarded my 5 stars to, are the Image DVD, the Kino DVD, and the Kino VHS. Although the differences between the Image and Kino transfers are noticeable, I found both were acceptable to me. I think it's partly a matter of personal preference rather than one being more accurately transferred than the other.

I don't pretend to have the technical expertise of some of your reviewers. So I'll limit my comments regarding transfer quality to the opening scenes of the movie where many of the transfers I've viewed are totally unacceptable. Luckily, the first version of the movie I ever saw (on VHS) was complete or I might not have realized that part of the movie's opening is missing from many versions (on both DVD and VHS). The opening scene of the film shows the sign of the Selznick Studios, followed by the Southern-style mansion front of the studios. That scene is accompanied by a fanfare played first by the trumpets. The next scene shows a night time panoramic view of Hollywood over which appear ascending titles and credits, which remind me of a red neon sign. This scene is accompanied by a gorgeous melody by Max Steiner. The previous fanfare makes the perfect introduction for Max Steiner's melody. The effect of the rising ""neon"" titles accompanied by Max Steiner's glorious music is emotionally overwhelming. I wish I had been there in 1937 to experience this in the movie theatre on the big screen.

Quite a few transfers of this movie are missing part or all of the opening scene of the Selznick Studios and the accompanying fanfare music. These ""butchered"" versions deprive the viewer of one of the most impressive openings to any movie ..... ever! Watching a butchered version is almost like listening to the first movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony from which someone had deleted the famous 4-note opening motif. The Image and Kino versions are all complete in the opening scene. If you have a different transfer, make sure you have the opening scenes as I've described them.",1432339200,2,4447,4.795039164490862

Don't be predjudiced because it was made in 1937==I believe it added to the drama.  For me, I prefer when situations are eluded to, left to your imagination as opposed to what is produced now which are often much more graphic.

He should have won the academy award that year.

The film is enjoyable but this restored version (which is the best there is out there right now) distracts at times.  I am still waiting for the PRISTINE RESTORED VERSION of this fine film.

681522,1,6303510361,"Last week I gave away an Electrolux  vacuum cleaner.  It was purchased by my mother in New Jersey in 1968.  It cleaned our homes in New Jersey and Florida for 15 years, and it is still functioning perfectly.  I only gave it away because today's lightweight vacs are much easier to tote.  I tell this story because there was a time in this country when companies took pride in their products and ripping consumers off was unheard of, or at the very least, it seldom occurred.  But the years have passed and companies don't care about quality anymore.  Now it's all about getting top dollar for inferior products that promise you everything and deliver nothing.  Such is the case with Kino's The Selznick Collection.  All five films in this boxed set claim the following:  MASTERED IN HD FROM AN ORIGINAL NITRATE 35MM PRINT PRESERVED BY THE GEORGE EASTMAN HOUSE MOTION PICTURE DEPARTMENT.  If this is actually true I am willing to eat all five DVDs and then the cardboard box itself.  All five films are of substandard quality, some of them so awful that they are barely viewable.  The most disastrous of them all is BIRD OF PARADISE, with the lovely Dolores del Rio, which is not only marred by visuals worthy of bad public domain piracy but is also afflicted with a distortion of its soundtrack from the very beginning of the film, making the dialog unintelligible, to say nothing about Max Steiner's fabulous score, which is distorted beyond recognition.  I have seen public domain copies of this film which are superior to this absolute merde Kino claims came from an original nitrate negative.  Sound and image problems plague all five releases.  The two Technicolor classics, A STAR IS BORN and NOTHING SACRED suffer from color variations which go from a pinkish hue to something that looks like three-strip Technicolor.  At no time during these two films does one get any semblance to real Technicolor or anything close to it.  The best of the worst are LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY and A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which is not saying much because the visuals are still substandard and so is the sound. It's just that compared to the other three aberrations, these two fare a little better.  But I would like to stress that the entire set is no better than a bad public domain copy of any of these films.  Kino has added no extras whatsoever, not even English subtitles.  It's a no frills package of unacceptable prints at premium prices.  This is an insult and a slap in the face to consumers and collectors.  There should be an agency that handles situations such as this, and Kino should be made liable, and be forced to reimburse EVERYONE who has fallen prey to their false claims and advertising and has purchased these five films, whether singly, or all together in a boxed set.  So be warned, if you spend any money on any of these 5 releases, you are just throwing your money away.  If you absolutely must have one or more of these films, I suggest borrowing them from your public library or renting them and making dubs.  It's exactly what Kino deserves for putting out crap like this.",1357516800,,3085,4.666666666666667

She feels most of today's movies are like video games and are to her uninteresting.  She has seen the Judy Garland version, but not the other two.

681524,2,6303510361,"This will be a short and - I hope - helpful review. Amazon does some really strange things by grouping ALL reviews of a title by the same Studio - i.e. all releaves over the years of a Disney classic. Thin this case I'm reviewing the September 18, 2012 release of this film by VCI under their ""Nostalgia Film Factory"" header. If you came to this titled through Amazon and found the 2012 VCI release, please sort all reviews by ""DATE"". I say that because this release - in it's released format has not been reviewed before. Sure the ""Star is Born"" 1937 (which I'm sure is now Public Domain) has been reviewed for the story. But be aware that this is not a recently restored print and should not be confused with the release from Kino.

VCI does some nice restorations - and I've reviewed many - but this is not one of them. It's a ""budget release"". Also there are lots of BONUS features to make it seem like ""A Night at the Movies"" - a trend Warners Started in the 1970s.

In addition to the 150 minute film, there is a 9-minute newsreel (including America Earhart getting lost) from Castle Films, A 3-minute ""Grampy"" cartoon and a 24-minute chapter of the serial ""Radio Patrol"". None of the prints is great. (Actually the Newsreel is best) and the Star Is Born print is dark throughout.

So, as a budget release, it okay but there are much better prints out there of this film.

And ALWAYS sort reviews on Amazon by DATE and compare year of review to the DVD release date so you are reading the review of the title you are looking to buy.

681525,5,6303510361,"Everytime I see this movie, I think of Vickie Lester (Janet Gaynor) pluckily saying 'this is Mrs. Norman Maine' as her eyes are moist with tears. What a trouper!
While I like the 1954 version of this movie with Judy Garland as Vickie which is a dramusical, I really have a soft spot for this version. Gaynor is oddly endearing as Vickie blending navet with a wide eyed wonderment as she traverses a tight rope to fame and fortune and falls in love with Norman Maine (Frederick March). As their paths converge, Norman's career is in freefall from the excesses of film success. He's bleary eyed and starting to look his age as his handsome face belies too much booze, too many late nights, and probably too many one night stands. The movie parts are getting stale and repetitive and movie audiences are reacting to the new and younger actors. Vickie, fresh off the train from the snowy midwest, is fresh and innocent and naive enough to believe she can crash into the movies just because she's always wanted too. Under Norman's wing, Vickie is prepped to become an actress while Norman is slammed by an antagonistic press agent named Libby and presented with the unfortunate realities of plummeting box office revenues for his films by studio head Charles Bickford. As the dynamic changes in their careers, Norman drowns his sorrows, goes into rehab, and starts feeling helpless while Vickie struggles mightily to support him. Added to the cast is Vickie's quirkily adorable grandmother played by May Robson who injects some of humor in her scenes.
Done in early technicolor. The general effect is a little jarring since the color is extreme in the sense that it doesn't look  natural; I get so wrapped up in the story that I forget about it.
in the end this is a well-scripted film that has some good performances and reflects the production values of producer David L. Selznick.",1340150400,,1878,4.7607361963190185

Its possible that there isn't any better source-material extant and nothing better will ever be available; the original Technicolor materials are often long-gone, especially for the earliest pictures like this one.",1337212800,4,609,5.214285714285714
681527,4,6303510361,"The original heartbreaking Hollywood romantic drama, ""A Star is Born"" makes its debut on Blu-ray.

While many people are familiar with George Cukor's 1954 classic film adaptation starring Judy Garland and James Mason, the very first film was back in 1937 and was produced by David O. Selznick (the producer known for ""Gone with the Wind"" and bringing Alfred Hitchock to the United States to direct ""Rebecca"" and ""Spellbound"") and a film directed by William A. Wellman (""Wings"", ""Nothing Sacred"").  The film was written by Wellman, Robert Carson, Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell.

The film would star Janet Gaynor (""Seventh Heaven"", ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"", ""Street Angel"", ""Lucky Star""), Fredric March (""The Best Year of Our Lives"", ""Nothing Sacred"", ""Design for Living"") and Adolphe Menjou (""Paths of Glory"", ""A Farewell to Arms"").

""A Star is Born"" was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning ""Best Story"" (and also earning a special Academy Award for ""Technicolor Cinematography"" for W. Howard Greene) and would become the first color film to be nominated for ""Best Picture"".

While there are earlier Hollywood films that would be based on one trying to make it in Hollywood or the perils of fame, ""A Star is Born"" would surprise audiences with its tragic ending and for a film of it's time, it was a a romantic drama that was an instant tearjerker.

VIDEO:

""A Star is Born"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1).  It's one of the earlier Technicolor films and while this film has been released on DVD before, many who have seen this film, saw it via terrible quality public domain videos.  May they have been downloaded or purchased on DVD.

I have seen the original public domain version and because it was Technicolor and in bad quality, for me, those public domain versions were unwatchable.  Fast forward to 2012 and Kino Lorber has presented us an authorized edition from the estate of David O. Selznick from the collection of George Eastman House.

With that being said, for those who are not familiar with Kino Lorber, they are not like a major studio or the Criterion Collection.  They do not do frame-by-frame restorations which is very expensive and laborious but they present the best quality of a film to present on Blu-ray.  So, these are films that will have dust, white specks and damage.  Kino Lorber is also selective on what releases will receive a Blu-ray release and with ""A Star is Born"", I'm pretty happy that they did choose this classic film and give it an HD release.

As expected from early Technicolor films, the colors are a bit softer than what one are used to seeing from a Technicolor film from the '50s or '60s, but still, there is clarity.  And compared to the public domain releases out there, this Blu-ray release of ""A Star is Born"" is a huge step via picture quality as colors are not faded.  Sure, there is some film damage and white specks but the clarity, the colors and even the black levels look great for this 75-year-old film and its worth upgrading from the PD copies and even the previous DVD's to this Blu-ray release.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""A Star is Born"" is presented in Linear PCM 2.0 monaural and once again, Kino Lorber doesn't clean up their releases.  They present the best quality of a film on Blu-ray.

So, there are moments of mild hissing and occasional pops but by no means will this affect your viewing. Dialogue is clear, Max Steiner's music is also clear and definitely much more pleasant to the ears compared to the PD release.

There are no subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""A Star is Born"" comes with the following special features:

  Gallery - Featuring 16 stills, posters and lobby cards.
  Wardrobe Test - (1:15) A Technicolor wardrobe test.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Before there was ""Sunset Boulevard"" and before the George Cukor classic starring Judy Garland, there was the 1937 William Wellman original.

And while the 1954 film was quite memorable and also was a musical with a different storyline, ""A Star Is Born"" is rather interesting because it took on a storyline of what was happening in Hollywood at that time.

Bare in mind, the transition from the silent era to the talkies, was the most difficult transition for many Hollywood talents.  While many were well-known in silent films, many who transitioned to talking films, saw their careers decline.  There was no gradual decline, one year you were hot, the next year your career was over.

And it has been well-documented of the many Hollywood talents that were unable to transition their careers from the 1920's to the 1930's and became alcoholics.

And while the classic film ""Sunset Boulevard"" featured that type of storyline focusing on a popular actress and her decline, in the 1930's, there were films that took on tabloid news about celebrity suicides and George Cukor (who directed the Judy Garland ""A Star is Born""), directed a 1932 film titled ""What Price is Hollywood?"" that dealt with one's waning career (an interesting side note: David O. Selznick admitted that Cukor's 1932 film was used as source material for ""A Star is Born"").

But with William Wellman's ""A Star is Born"" is your classic Hollywood story about a celebrity couple.  Unlike the 1954 version which Judy Garland used as a vehicle to once again showcase her vocals, this is no musical.  This is about two people who found love, but yet as one becomes a star, the other becomes a falling star and is unable to cope with his fall from stardom.

And with the 1954 version, you expect Judy Garland to sing.  With Janet Gaynor, what many have known her from is F.W. Murnau's ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"", ""7th Heaven"" and ""Lucky Star"".  Often she played the heartbroken woman, but for this film, she had a chance to show off various sides of her acting, may it be the tearful farmgirl who wants to go to Hollywood, the comedic actress trying to show off her acting impersonations to Hollywood higher-ups and most importantly, playing the strong-willed wife who has achieved success thanks to her husband.

So, Gaynor was an intriguing actress to play the role of Vicki, because we see a different side to her acting.

Fredric March on the other hand, he has always played the suave character.  May it be his role in ""Design for Living"" to ""Nothing Sacred"", he is a charismatic actor and while his Norman Maine portrays him as strong-willed (this is a man who stays a man and never shows his sensitive side) man who is an alcoholic (strong-willed, but inside, he is frustrated and depressed).

The original also was helped by its surrounding characters.  May Robson does a fine job of playing the sensible grandmother (who actually has a wonderful supporting actress role in the film, a character missing in the 1954 version), Adolphe Menjou as the producer Oliver Niles and bumbling Andy Devine as Vicki's good friend, Danny.

This is a film that focuses on the perils of fame and while I enjoyed this 1937 film for keeping within the confines of a Hollywood story without the ""happily ever after"", it's George Cukor's film that was full of emotion.  Not to say that Janet Gaynor and Fredric March lacked emotion at all, it's acting that was common for 1930's, Judy Garland and James Mason took the role to another level in the 1954 film adaptation.  There is no doubt that the musical version was emotionally charged and was much more of an emotional film.

While both films are similar, yet they were very different and needless to say, George Cukor knew how to make the remake even more powerful and emotional than the original film.

Still, for any cinema fan, a chance to see Janet Gaynor in her Academy Award ""Best Actress"" nominated performance and to see her in a much different light than she was previously seen in the Murnau films (and also to see her in early Technicolor) was quite enjoyable.  Also, if musicals are not your thing and has pushed you away from watching the 1954 version, fortunately in 2012, we have the best version of the original ""A Star is Born"" on video ala Blu-ray.  You can trash those public domain versions or give them away to a friend, but if you want the definitive version of this 1937 film, this Blu-ray release is the way to go!

Granted, the picture and audio quality may not be pristine but still, this Blu-ray release is so much better than the old public domain copies and the film has never looked so good until now!

Overall, ""A Star is Born"" is another wonderful release from Kino Lorber and a fine addition to their Kino Classics lineup on Blu-ray.  I look forward to more of these classic Hollywood films from Kino!  Definitely recommended!",1336176000,6,8644,4.764271323035595
681528,2,6303510361,"At paying full price at $29.99 at Barnes & Noble and reading that it was a restored print from George Eastman House, I was expecting a lot more than what I saw.  The DVD from a few years ago was better than this, though still flawed and needing further restoration.  I give 2 stars only that the story is still one of the greatest regarding Hollywood of yesteryear.  The transfer to Bluray is a shear disappointment, sound & picture, especially when one of the trailers for ""Nothing Sacred"" with Carole Lombard that is included in the Features portion is in so much better shape than this film.  That film was restored.  Someone needs to call Martin Scorcese, Thelma Schoonmaker & their teams to get this one back into pristine condition.  I'm not wasting money on this classic again until it is fully remastered the way ""Gone With The Wind"" was done.  Flawlessly.",1331596800,3,864,4.644736842105263

681530,5,6303510361,"David O. Selznick's 1937 production of A STAR IS BORN was a re-working of 1932's WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD, and was remade in 1954 as a semi-musical with Judy Garland and James Mason. I've always preferred the '37 Janet Gaynor/Fredric March version as the best handling of the tragic story about the happiness and heartbreak that go hand in hand with fame and fortune as a wife's acting career takes to the heights, while her alcoholic husband's takes a nosedive.

Directed by the always dependable William Wellman, A STAR IS BORN definitely tugs at the heartstrings but does it without being saccharine. As many times as I've seen it, it never fails to stir my emotions thanks to the excellent, truthful performances of both Gaynor and March, and Max Steiner's poignant music score. The film also authentically depicts  Hollywood in that era; the machinery that went behind the tinsel, and the sometimes ruthless treatment the stars had to endure from the studios and public alike.

Kino's Blu-ray is a noticeable improvement over the previous DVD Image release, having been mastered from an original 35mm nitrate print from George Eastman House. I compared both versions, and the color saturation of the Blu-ray is much richer than the DVD, and the picture is clear and sharp without any digital ghosting. The print has cue-marks and some wear, but still looks like actual film in 1080p resolution, which is something the previous DVD doesn't fully replicate. The extras are nothing special: a few trailers, some stills and lobby cards, and a wardrobe test.

All things considered, Kino's latest release, while imperfect, is the best version of A STAR IS BORN that's currently available and I, for one, am glad I upgraded.

This honest drama surely remains as one of the greatest movies Hollywood ever made about itself.",1329004800,,1817,4.983498349834983
681600,2,6303510361,"As with other fans of this classic film, I am greatly disappointed that KINO'S latest offering is not much of an improvement over previous KINO DVD releases of the film.  While the IMAGE/KINO DVDs in 1998 and 2004 were at that time a marked improvement over the myriad of public domain travesties, the elements utilized for this release are only marginally better, despite the HD processing.  This is also particularly disappointing when the film's fan base is aware that a restored print (by UCLA) exists.

According to a March, 2010 blog-post by NY POST film critic Lou Lumenick, he said, ""Daniel Selznick, son of producer David O. Selznick, told me two years ago that WHV was doing a high-definition transfer of a UCLA restoration of the 1937 original, which has long languished in public-domain hell.""  Lumenick also quoted a Warner rep as saying, ""When we looked at the master of the '37 'A Star is Born,' we realized that it really needed, more importantly, deserved a special restoration...using our Ultra Resolution process to bring out the glorious Technicolor of that film. So rather than it be an add on...some less than-terrific extra content, we pulled it back so as not to diminish the importance of either versions.""

I suppose it was wishful thinking on my part that KINO would be releasing that long-awaited ""restored"" version. This will be the VERY last version I invest in until either Warner Home Video, Criterion or KINO offers us the ultimate version -- and that will only be when the restored print from the UCLA effort is finally utilized as the source material.

Despite's the Selznick Estate's stamp of approval, I would suggest people save their money and wait.",1328918400,23,1688,4.905263157894737

We're not talking about ragged Public Domain Transfers here, folks!

As for the film itself, I think one thing that gets overlooked these days is the solid casting, and I'm not just talking about the two main leads, Janet Gaynor and Frederic March, as great as they are. Some of the biggest supporting players fro the thirties are in this film. I found Andy Devine and Edgar Kennedy to be quite good in their supporting roles. With the then celebrated actress May Robson (Best known for 1933's LADY FOR A DAY), and of course, Adolph Menjou, you simply can't go wrong!",1328054400,3,1070,4.567708333333333

She was too old for the role in the first place, and her hair and makeup were absolutely matronly.  She looked like a little mouse next to the  statuesque, stunning young woman Norman brought as a date to the party at which Esther was waitressing,  For me, Miss Gaynor, in her early thirties at the time, strained credibility too much playing an ingenue. It can be done. See Bette Davis in the film ""In This Our Life"" , playing 21-ish when she herself was 37. Wardrobe, hair and makeup!",1286928000,3,650,4.391666666666667

Sometimes her character tends to be an overly sweet hayseed, but she keeps her vital  with excellent acting.  Frederick March stars as the established movie star, ""Norman Maine"" who falls in love with and helps Esther start her career, but he realizes as her star rises, his is fading.  He is a heavy drinker, older and a proud man.  Seeing that he is sinking into obscurity, he cannot play second fiddle and commits suicide.

681608,5,6303510361,"A Star Is Born packs a great deal of action, suspense, drama and even some light comedy into a film that is truly remarkable. The acting is very convincing; Fredric March in particular gives blood to make his character comes to life on the screen. The cinematography and the choreography both work well, especially in crowd scenes in which there are lots of extras. The plot moves along at a good pace, too.

When the action starts, we quickly meet Esther Blodgett (Janet Gaynor) who comes home with her younger brother from going to the movies. Esther's mother and father are not too happy about her fixation with Hollywood. However, Esther's kindly and wise grandmother Lettie Blodgett (May Robson) encourages Esther to follow her heart and her dreams although she also warns Esther that there may be a painful price for stardom. Lettie then gives Esther the first of several sums of money to help Esther live in Los Angeles at least until she can find extra work.

But much more happens. Esther meets and soon befriends assistant director Daniel ""Danny"" McGuire (Andy Devine) who wants to help Esther find work but he's not too powerful--or employed--himself. One night Danny and Esther attend a concert at The Hollywood Bowl; and Esther sees Norman Maine (Fredric March) in person for the first time. He's quite drunk and embarrassing to his actress girlfriend Anita Regis (Elizabeth Jenns); but not much happens between Norman and Esther until she gets a waitress gig through Danny where Norman and the fat cats from the movie studio are socializing. Norman falls for Esther; and he pushes movie producer Oliver Niles (Adolph Menjou) to do a screen test with him and Esther. Esther is a huge hit; and this certainly complicates things as Norman's drinking is interfering with his acting career.

Finally, Esther and Norman are married--but the moment they return from their honeymoon Oliver and studio press agent Libby (Lionel Stander) arrive at their new home to tell Norman he's washed up and that all they really want is Esther. They try one more film with Norman just to be sure; but that fails as Esther becomes even more popular with the public.

Soon Norman is at home and although it seems remarkable people no longer recognize him at all. You'd think at least a few people would after the long career he had; but then again this is a movie making a point about the pitfalls of Hollywood. Norman even enters a sanitarium to try to combat his alcoholism.

What happens after this? Will Esther and Norman be able to handle this stress or will their marriage break apart? Will Norman ever find acting work again? What about Esther's idea to get Norman a part in a movie produced by Oliver Niles--will that come to pass? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!

A Star Is Born has been made more than once; it fact, there are three versions of this movie. This version has excellent acting; but if you like musicals then you owe it to yourself to get the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason. As regards this version, I commend the actors for their outstanding acting. I highly recommend this for fans of the actors in this movie and people who like classic movies. In addition, this film is a must-have for persons who wish to study the tough realities of the motion picture industry.",1240531200,,3325,4.743944636678201

The story is the same in that veteran actor meets new actress, they fall in love and get married. While his career declines, hers takes off. It is a wonderful love story that will make you want to see it again. But, instead after this film try the next one with Judy Garland to see another version.

Yet, at least director Wellman hits upon it here, without throwing the entire film into disarray. March knows that he's had it as an actor, and only through the auspices of his rising srar wife Gaynor is he able to avoid jail time. If Gaynor seems almost too good to be true,then so be it. Anything might have been better than her negative, sarcastic upbringing. Too late does anyone understand the depth of March's depression; no doubt to this viewer that his final swim towards Hawaii was a noble gesture on his part, paving the way for his wife's blossoming stardom.

The lack of songs and dancings in the older version actually forces my attention to the two main characters. What the older version lacks - in lyrics and dancing - it more than makes up in the refined character development and superb acting. Vicki (Janet Gaynor) 's grandma could understand Vicki's dream and hope in Hollywood. Once she ensured Vicki had the conviction and was prepared to go to great lengths, without any doubt, to pursue her dream, she gave her blessings and full financial support. This was handled warmly and delicately. In addition, Norman Maine (Federich March) was 100% convincing whose leading actor career winded in the wrong direction. He spotted Vicki from obscurity and saw the rising career of his beloved wife with mixed feelings. He loved Vicki that much while suffering deeply inside. Despite the encouragement of his studio friend (Adolphe Menjou), he was too proud to take any hand outs. In the end, Vicki's grandma went to Hollywood, for the first time, and attended Vicki's film premeire - a master stroke to see both Vicki's and grandma's dream fulfilled.

Fredrich March, Janet Gaynor and Adolphe Menjou were heavyweights in the big screen. I reckon the older version more warm and touching. A truly wonderful movie. In addition, Janet Gaynor was the lady who won the first Oscar for a leading actress in recognition of her work in three other films.

This movie is about the role and the impact of the images in Hollywood and about a feeling rarely treated, because not particularly expressive, in cinema : gratitude.

David O.

When we watch A STAR IS BORN now, we are boggled by the quality of the dialogues of the film and the importance of the supporting roles.

This is one of my all time favorite old movies.

A Star is Born manages to be both comic and tragic while portraying the ups-and-downs of fame and love in the lives of ""Vicki Lester"" and ""Norman Maine"" (roles played to perfection, earning both Janet Gaynor and Frederic March Academy Awards). Vicki comes to Hollywood and is discovered...then the heart of the story begins. Vicki and Norman fall in love and marry.

This film's merits are many, I need not comment on them, but will make a comment on the cast.  While the entire cast is outstanding, the real standout is Janet Gaynor who portrays Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester in such a way that you can connect with her and feel her sincerity on a level that you cannot with Judy Garland in the 1954 version (and the less said about the 1970s Barbra Streisand version the better).  The rest of the performances in this film are super.

This film, produced by the late great David O. Selznick and released through United Artists, is currently in the public domain and many of the numerous DVDs/VHSs of such films are of deplorable picture and sound quality.  Fortunately, it is not so on this DVD release from Image.  The colors are extremely bold and vibrant.  There are some age-related artifacts present and graininess is visible in a number of places, however this has been kept to a minimum.  I will forgive these shortcomings considering the elements used for the DVD transfer are nearly 70 years old.  3-strip Technicolor was still in its infancy in 1937 (indeed, the first feature shot entirely in this process was released only 2 years earlier), but some outstanding results were had even then.  The sound, while obviously rendered in 1937 recording technology, has been nicely cleaned up for this release, allowing the musical score by the venerable Max Steiner to shine as it should.

Norman has a chance encounter with Esther at a concert and then again at a fancy Hollywood party where she is moonlighting as a waitress. He is immediately taken by her natural beauty and sweetness.  Norman chooses Esther to be his leading lady in his next movie.  When the movie is released, Esther, who is renamed Vicki Lester by the studio, becomes an ""overnight"" star (that is after she suffers many rejections and near poverty prior to her stardom).
""A Star Is Born"" provides a realistic view of the crassness and undeniable glamour of Hollywood.  And it examines the fleeting nature of stardom which Hollywood creates and then conveniently and cruelly destroys when a star is no longer viable.
Everything about this movie is first rate in particular the perceptive direction by William Wellman, the smart screenplay by Wellman and Robert Carson, and the uniformly excellent performances by an all-star cast.
March and Gaynor are at their very best giving restrained, yet powerful performances.  March's skill as an actor makes the demise of Norman Maine, at the behest of a fickle public and a mostly callous Hollywood establishment, heartbreaking to watch.  And Esther's quiet strength and unconditional love and support of her adoring, self-destructive husband are subtly and convincingly conveyed by the gifted Miss Gaynor.

I discovered Fredric March in 2002, and in one year collected over 54 of his films. During this time, I bought 2 other VHS versions of A STAR IS BORN; the first one was horrible...scratchy sound, the mouths didn't match with the words, blurry and washed out color. The second one was a bit better, color not so good, but at least the movement of their mouths was in step with the soundtrack. I really enjoy this film, and wanted to find a better print. This KINO print will not disappoint! It is superb...while the color is not like what you will see today, it is very very good. I was so impressed; what a pleasure it is to see a film almost as it looked originally in 1937.
I mainly wanted to share the news that this is an excellent VHS (I called KINO, and they said they don't know that they will ever put it on DVD...too bad, but I think I have seen bootleg DVD's taken from this KINO print on ebay.) This video is well worth the money due to the wonderful quality.
Many have already stated their opinion on this film. I greatly admire Fredric March and he did such a good job portraying Norman Maine. I liked Janet Gaynor's performance as well. It is fun to see some of the famous Hollywood locations in these early days. It is a good story...nice to see a wife sticking by her man through the good times and bad. Nice to see how she honors his name and memory at the end of the film. Nice to see that she didn't sit and have a pity party about how horrible a husband Norman was. She was of beautiful character...you especially see this when at the Academy Awards, and he accidently slaps her face, she just takes his hand and calmly walks with him back to the table. Later that evening, at home, Norman (March) is passed out drunk in a chair, and we see Esther(Gaynor) kneeling before him, still in her gown, with her Oscar lying on the floor beside her, taking off his shoes. What love and devotion and lack of selfishness is portrayed in that one simple scene... We know her heart was hurting; none of this was easy for her.
I know many people just adore the Judy Garland version. I have seen it, and my main problem was I thought there was too much singing ( I am not fond of musicals), and I also felt Judy looked too old and weary for the part. You could see this in her eyes. She lacked the youthful innocence Gaynor had. Now if Judy had done it when she was younger...but this is only my opinion.

If you don't like an emotional, roller- coaster like tear jerker, then this version of Star is for you.  Mary Marnie Brown Hair is probably a straight ,Judy Garland hating detractor.  That poor ,culturally deprived lass even thought the Wizard of Oz was a horrible movie. Pity, pity, pity...  If you want,you could get both versions and compare them side by side,performance for performance, and decide which version of  ""Star"" is the true #1 classic.  (on a personal note, I prefer to skip the appetizer and go straight to the meat and potatoes.)Gaynor and March will entertain you, but their performances will have seemed like charicatures after you've seen the Garland and Mason version.  If you want tame, go with Gaynor.  If you want to experience a full gamut of emotions, pretty much a religious experience, than get the Garland verion.",1039219200,,1109,4.962162162162162
681743,4,6303510361,"I don't understand why anyone would prefer the later remakes to this version, which is so far superior as to be incomparable to the later attempts. Who could be better than Fredric March? Of course it was a bit bizarre for him to play a fading star when in reality he was in the Hollywood limelight. I felt this version had so much more depth and story to it, without the multitudinous songs or the shallow world of musicals to interfere.
I'm not sure really what to say about this except that it's very very good and I think you and everyone should see it at least once. My favourite moments... in the cafe where Fred drinks raw egg while Janet impersonates various movie stars at another table. And at the preview of their first film together, they kiss for a LONG time, and Janet shrinks down blushing into her chair. There are others, just can't remember them at the moment. And the last part is very touching of course. Loved how Grandma couldn't take the bright lights.
I liked the producer better in this one than the Garland version as well. He seemed to have more character and wasn't so goony looking.
The colour quality of the video is admittedly terrible, but I have heard that the DVD version is a restored one and much better and easier to watch. I have not seen it myself to compare for certain.
Well, I've said my piece. This is the version to see. Don't bother with the other ones - they can't hold a candle to this one.",1031788800,3,1437,4.385767790262173
681744,5,6303510361,"Though this is the only non-musical version of the thrice filmed tale, this original is my favorite. It may more than likely appear dated to some, but it is  not only a wonderful story about the price of fame, but an early record of Hollywood history. Fredric March and Janet Gaynor are wonderfully touching as the doomed couple ,""Norman Maine"" and ""Vicki Lester"", she being the new discovery whose *star* is ascending, totally eclipsing March's descending stardom. This was my first glimpse at Janet Gaynor, and I fell in love with her. May Robson is great also as Gaynors feisty Granny, who encourages the young, unknown dreamer to follow her dreams, and is there at the end when she seems to have given up. There are many wonderful moments, as when Gaynor, as the then pre-stardom ""Esther Blodgett"" tries to get the attention of movie big-whigs by her impressions of then popular stars Mae West, Katherine Hepburn, and Garbo. Andy Devine (that VOICE!!) is comical as the fledgling director who befriends the naive, broke, and new to Hollywood ""Esther"", and sticks with her through her metamorphosis to ""Vicki Lester"", and her tragedy and heartache. There's also fun scenes of early Hollywood locales, like the Hollywood Bowl, and interesting behind the scenes looks at the star-making process, when a little nobody  is given everything from a new hairline to a new name. I always find myself blubbering like a fool at the films end, when Gaynor, having triumphantley come back from tragedy, delivers her final, famous line with a teary-eyed close-up. Yes, it's corny, but I'm crying not only because it's a tear-jerker, but also at the memory of all those beautiful fools of that long ago time, when there really was a place called  HOLLYWOOD.",1023840000,7,1746,4.911864406779661

But this love affair is tragic because the man is at the end of his charm and can only regress, whereas she represents the new style, the new era that is opening at this moment and she goes up so fast she crushes her husband into oblivion and non-existence. But she remains faithful to her love, and he does not want to block her in her career. So he commits suicide to free her road and she nearly cracks up and goes away. But she can stick to her career by assuming his name as hers. A very sad film about the film industry and its law of the jungle.

681747,4,6303510361,"Hollywood has usually been too close to Hollywood to present an authentic picture of itself.  But this Selznick Internation offering from 1937 is still an excellent movie with the full flavour of the Hollywood of the mid-thirties.  The story of a movie-struck North Dakota farm girl named Esther Blodgett who goes to Hollywood, suffers many discouragements, then suddenly finds herself catapulted to stardom.  The piquant Janet Gaynor is Esther, with Fredric March as a Great Lover whose career is ending as hers begins.  Miss Gaynor (who looks well in Technicolor) gives a splendid performance which fairly confounded the critics back in 1937.  The story of Esther Blodgett is, with minor variations, the story of a score of Hollywood stars (at least in days long past).  Her father was a paper hanger who failed on the stage.  After High School, Gaynor got a job in a movie theatre and dreamed of being a star.  Arriving in Hollywood in 1924, she was cast opposite Charles Farrell in SEVENTH HEAVEN in 1927, in the same year, she also played the tragic farmer's wife in SUNRISE; she won the very first AA for best actress!",1004659200,,1124,4.848167539267016
681748,5,6303510361,"I'll confess: I saw this movie on 16mm when I used to run the projector at an art film house back in college. I can't comment on the quality of the film being sold here; I begin with the caveat that my comments are on the content of the film only.
First, I am compelled to add the historical note that Janet Gaynor is the first winner of the Oscar for Best Actress in the history of the Academy Awards (1927, mainly for her work in Sunrise).
Next, I want to say that screenwriter Dorothy Parker's sarcasm is sometimes so thick, that one must watch the film several times, in order to see through it, layer by layer, before one begins to see her subtle wit. With repeated viewings, the film is funny, then tragic, then funny again.
I have not seen the other versions of this film on purpose. This film is so gloriously complex, and made up of so many tiny parts, but with not a seam showing, that I am afraid seeing one of the others would only spoil the original for me. (One of the great regrets in my life is seeing Mel Brooks' To Be or Not To Be.)
This film belongs among the immortals-- or at least among the pantheon of the truly stupendous-- the films that are difficult to describe because one lacks the vocabulary, because ground-breaking, wonderous, magnificent, and all the superlatives have been over-applied to the slightly superior. I wish these words had been reserved for this film.

Most cinemagoers are familiar with the more famous 1954 musical version starring Judy Garland and James Mason; but even fewer are familiar with the motion picture that preceded it. Released in 1937 and starring Academy Award winners Janet Gaynor and Frederic March, this non musical version merely served as the blueprint for the even more spectacular (and in my opinion, definitive) version of the story, though that does not mean that this early version is inferior. Well written and expertly acted, with comic moments provided throughout, including by Max, future butler to Mrs. and Mr. Hart. Two years away from releasing his masterpiece, David O. Selznick showed his brilliance with this picture.

I have not seen nor do I plan to watch the 1976 remake with Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. 98% of the comments I have read on that version trash it completely, and say that the 1954 film is better.
