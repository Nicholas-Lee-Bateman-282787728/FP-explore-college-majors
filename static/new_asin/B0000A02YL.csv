1899508,5,B0000A02YL,"We (spouse and children and I) just viewed this DVD tonight and are extremely pleased. The familiar ""bad-guy-caught-at-the-end"" format is used as well as the typical Scooby Doo format of mishaps with the Mystery Machine, food-hungry Scooby & Shaggy, red herrings, ballads, etc. plus a very mild love-interest for Scooby. The clothes and vocals are just like the original series, too.
What really caught our attention was the similar style to the original televsion series when Scooby and the gang visited various locations and learned things about the places they visited. Having visited Vera Cruz and Mexico City, we were struck by the similarities with the cartoon animation of Vera Cruz and Mexico City. We were also pleased to see Mexico/Mexicans portrayed in a positive way rather than as sterotypes.-There is even some basic Spanish used in a way to educate youngsters.
The cupacabra (evil monster/ goatsucker) which frightened tourists from Vera Cruz was a bit dated, but caused us to recall the scare which griped Mexico a few years ago.
We liked the voices and animation and were pleased to see the familar format of catching the bad guys in the end (""those meddeling kids""...) unlike some other recent Scobby DVD's where the monsters/witches are real. The cultural nuances and theme of ""things are not always the way the seem"" was also educational.
The only  negative about this DVD is that the languages are English and French with Spanish available only in subtitles. One would think the title would suggest a DVD with vocals in Spanish...",1065571200,6,1551,5.035019455252918
1899509,2,B0000A02YL,"Back again in the brand new slicker animation form, the Mystery Inc gang head down to Mexico to visit Fred's e-mail pal but get caught up in the Chupacapra mystery as said beast begins terrorising the locals. It's not very good as the plot is practically discarded in favor of endless running around scenes and over-indulgence in set pieces.
The recent Scooby Doo feature-length animations have had decent stories, nice atmospheres and a couple red-herrings. It's very post modern and has certainly help revamp the franchise. But Monster of Mexico feels very dated and 60's. The gang are back wearing their old clothes instead of the modern gear they wore in the first four animated movies.
The ending is no surprise and completely unsatisfying. I don't like it. I wish for the next one to be a little more sophisticated. I mean children are intelligent and they deserve intelligent entertainment. Monster of Mexico may have been okay back in the 60's but in the modern day it's quite poor.
The DVD has a great 1.33:1 picture and a rather good Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. The extras are rubbish apart from the commentary by Shaggy and Scooby which is actually a really neat touch. I was excited at the Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman trailer featured here but it's 20 seconds long and shows you nothing. What's the point?",1065225600,3,1315,4.797356828193832

1899544,2,B0000A02YL,"Don't get me wrong. This film is like Legend of the Vampire in more than a few ways. Again, the voice cast from where are you returns sans the deceased Don Messick. We also get the original music and sound effects. The problem is with the story and its execution. The story this time is way too over the top even for Scooby Doo. Scooby's romance is cute and the scene involving the gang emailing each other is charming and a subtle way to update the franchise but the film suffers too much in too many areas. Legend of the Vampire was great because it was a clever rehash of a repetitive yet classic series. Monster of Mexico is a rehashed rehash of a rehashed series. Scenes from this film are almost exactly copied from legend in subject, making it the most blatant of all copycats. The voices, music, and sound effects just salvage this film into average fare.",1469059200,,863,4.433962264150943

1899552,2,B0000A02YL,"Released in 2003, SCOOBY-DOO! AND THE MONSTER OF MEXICO is twentieth in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market.

MEXICO finds the gang traveling to meet Freds pen-pal, Alejo Otero, who lives in Veracruz, where he and his family own and operate a lavish hotel.  Upon arrival, however, the gang finds the hotel almost empty: tourists have been frightened away by stories of El Chupacabra, a monster that has recent appeared in the city.  The gang, of course, decides to investigate, and are soon looking for a kidnapped Daphne, stumbling in and out of Mexican ruins, and doing battle with ancient sculptures that come to life.

A good many series fans have described MEXICO as the worst entry in the feature length series.  Im not so sure of thatI found MUSIC OF THE VAMPIRE almost unwatchablebut its very obvious that the creators of this particular title put very little time and effort into the script.  Velma makes a number of factual errors in her comments, the plot is wildly incoherent, and the whole thing is crammed with filler.  But the ultimate killer is the pace: it drags, it drags, it drags.  You can easily watch one of these Scooby-Doo flicks in a single sitting, but this one was so weary that I had to take a coffee break midway through.  Young and undiscerning fans will probably love it, but for the older viewers, you just cant suspend disbelief enough to make it okay.

1899694,4,B0000A02YL,"It was nice to know that initially, after Warner Bros. Animation began making direct-to-video Scooby-Doo movies in 1998, that they didn't forget about those who preferred the classics. (I do enjoy the previous movies made before this one, except for ""Alien Invaders."") In wake of the live-action Scooby-Doo feature film, and their then-new (and pretty crappy) ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" animated series, Warner Bros. Animation decided to try a different approach for their direct-to-video movies. Abandoning the more dark, suspenseful and fantasy-oriented style the first four movies had (though ""Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase"" was the more light-hearted one of the four), they decided to go for a more retro approach for ""Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire,"" in a manner similar to the ""Night of the Living Doo"" TV special produced in a similar retro format (except that was produced by Cartoon Network, not Warner Bros.) This was also carried over to this movie, and really helps it. Had it been produced in a different style, several of the things in the story would not have worked. Unfortunately, they abandoned this style in 2004, when the executive suits took over and retooled them into a more realistic style, basically rendering the 2004-2009 movies into 70-minute episodes of ""What's New, Scooby-Doo,"" that lasted until a much-needed improving came with ""Abracadabra-Doo"" in 2010.

But enough of that; on to reviewing this movie. While this movie is indeed pretty fun, I didn't enjoy it as much as ""Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire."" I am a little annoyed how they went and changed the Chupacabra into a purple hairy Bigfoot-wannabe instead of the reptilian monster according to original Spanish legends. Many of the Mexican cultures are also depicted in the same stereotypical manner as the Speedy Gonzales cartoons (no surprise, as Warner Bros. Animation DID make this movie.) However, Warner did a great job making the movie look and sound like Hanna-Barbera made it; an interesting change from the more Warner/anime-esque style used in the first four movies, along with the Adelaide Productions-influenced style (think ""Jackie Chan Adventures,"" ""Men in Black: the Animated Series"" and ""The Boondocks"") used on ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" and the 2004-2009 direct-to-video movies. The original Scooby-Doo designer Iwao Takamoto was heavily involved with this movie, and it really shows. I also really loved hearing Velma's original voice again, along with Heather North as Daphne (her main voice from 1970 to 1986), and of course Casey Kasem as Shaggy (though the voice was obviously aging by this time) and Frank Welker pulling double-duty as Scooby-Doo and Fred (the latter having been his original voice since 1969!) The vintage Hanna-Barbera sound effects are also used heavily to enhance the ""retro"" feel, something ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" and many of the other movies (except ""Vampire"" and ""Mask of the Blue Falcon"") are sorely missing, and the soundtrack often consists of synthesized contemporary remixes of the classic late 1960s Scooby-Doo music pieces (similar to ""Legend of the Vampire,"" except many here are given a more ""Mariachi"" flavor to keep with the Mexico theme.) With the exception of the film's Mexico-themed ""Viva Las Vegas"" parody (""Viva Mexico""), the vocal songs are not that memorable.

The animation is pure eye candy, but I will admit it's not as retro-looking as the Scooby-Doo movies and TV specials made since 2010 (we even have the whites on the characters' eyes here, unlike in the older shows and the recent movies!) There are some bits where we get a bit of nice full animation, but there are also some bits where it seems to slow down. The story does linger a bit at times, but the comedy and action sequences all make up for that.
And another thing I enjoy; this film is very cartoony, like the older shows were! The first four movies, as well as many of the recent ones, are done in a more ""fantasy"" type of style that somewhat fits with the supernatural plots, and the 2004-2009 movies and ""What's New, Scooby-Doo"" were made to look and sound more like real life instead of a cartoon. There is quite a bit of slapstick, and nearly everyone seems to have a hint of that classic Hanna-Barbera cartoony trait to them. The mystery is also doubled here, in order to make it fit with the extended running time, a problem many later movies had.
The DVD special features I really enjoyed were the audio commentary by Shaggy, Scooby-Doo and Fred  (I actually tend to enjoy when this happens on cartoon DVDs, like on a couple of the ""Ren and Stimpy"" DVD sets), along with the ""making of"" featurette and the fake ""bloopers"" (there's a particularly fun set of ""outtakes"" where Scooby-Doo keeps trying to pull the rubber mask off a living skeleton, each time with a fun reveal such as Scrappy-Doo (don't worry, he doesn't speak!), repeated skull masks underneath each skull, Yogi Bear, Fred Flintstone, even another Scooby!)

Definitely worth it if you are a big Scooby-Doo fan and also enjoy the classics a lot. It's too bad no more movies (or even a series) were produced like this!",1372982400,3,5132,4.998830409356725

My kids love them, which makes me sooo happy, just glad the younger ones love SD as much as I did, lol.

I make tacos, we watch Monster of Mexico, play a couple of games, and have a ""sleepover"" where we sleep downstairs on the pull out couch.

1899765,2,B0000A02YL,"The best way to begin is to show you where I stand. I think ""Zombie Island"" and ""The Witch's Ghost"" were excellent. I didn't much care for ""Alien Invasion"" or ""Cyber Chase."" I thought ""The Legend of the Vampire"" was a surprisingly good return to form. Onto chapter six. I can't really say this is one of Scooby's better movies. It kind of lacks the punch and surprises of ""Zombie Island"" and ""The Witch's Ghost."" Instead of the scarey surprises seen in the first two movies, this 6th chapter seems to rely more on silly chases. (But if you like the original episodes, you probably won't mind that so much.) Also, in my opinion, the script is weaker which means the movie seems very long and drawn out. (""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost"" don't seem to have many dull moments at all.) And, I won't say too much here, but when the mystery is uncovered and you really didn't get to know the culprit in the first place, a certain edge is missing. (In ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost,"" we got to know the culprits very well in the 1st half of the movie, and therefore, there was  a scarey sense of recognition when the plots were uncovered. The main reason I can give to watch this movie is that it was at least nice to the original line up from the early cartoons (Casey Kasem-Shaggy, Frank Welker-Fred, Heather North-Daphne, and Nicole Jaffee-Velmah) together again. The movie is worth some interest, but it's more of a long episode. If you like Scooby, this movie is watchable. But, don't expect the terror, intensity, and suspense of ""Zombie Island,"" ""The Witch's Ghost,"" or even ""Legend of the Vampire.""",1113782400,5,1607,4.618881118881119

All the same, the Legend of the Vampire totally insulted the vampire myth, and so I didn't expect this new one to be any different. For that reason, I waited until it was being played on the cartoon network before watching...

Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico

Here's how it ranked...

Sound: 3.5/5

Like Legend of the Vampire, this movie used a lot of the songs from the original series, and a few new ones, but unlike Legend of the Vampire, the original songs in this series were stereotypical to the point of being annoying. Hence the additional half-point down from that film.

Graphics: 3/5

The same grade that I gave the graphics in ""Legend of the Vampire"" and for the same reasons. This movie uses graphics that were just not as good as they could, or logically should have been, and were barely even better than those seen in the original series.

Story Concept: 3/5

Slightly less cheesy than the concept in Legend of the Vampire, but no less cynical towards the supernatural. Scooby and the gang visit Mexico for no real reason except to be in time for a mexican halloween, where they encounter El Chupacabre, and find out that there's a plot brewing. But as in the last movie, and the series, there were no real monsters. This creature was really just some woman in an animatronic suit. That was annoying, and I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it for that reason alone.

Story Presentation: 3/5

Similar to Legend of the Vampire in presentation, cause and resolution, except that the pleasing scenes of Daphne and Velma hanging out as they did in that movie were dropped in favor of scenes of the entire gang as stereotypical (and somewhat insulting) mexican tourists. Like in Legend of the Vampire, there is no real monster, but to make things even worse, Velma makes some comments near the end about monster stories that really cheezed me off. Her acts of superhuman strength in mid-movie were balanced off by the fact that they spent that whole section of the film getting chased my monstrous stone statues and tourists; a part which had nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and was seemingly added just to extent the length. The words of many of the bit-part characters got on my nerves too. I simply found the movie distasteful. Yes, it's scooby, and like Legend of the Vampire, it's funny scooby material, but it was presented too much like an episode of the series, and not enough like something worth making a movie over.

Acting: 5/5

Perfect grade here, because who plays Velma, Shaggy, Daphne and Freddy like their original voice actors? Like in Legend of the Vampire, the original actors returned, but again, it's a shame they had to pick a film like this to lend their voices to.

All in All: 3.5/5

I enjoyed this movie more than alien invaders, but less than Legend of the Vampire, because honestly, Legend of the Vampire at least had A LITTLE nostalgia to it and didn't go overboard into cheesy behavior and unforgivable puns like this movie does. However, this movie had no thrills at all, and was really just a silly little romp through a country which was, at best, a caricature of a real one. Frankly, I wanted more from Scooby, but it would be a lie to say I had EXPECTED more. This film is most comparable to Legend of the Vampire in general mood, pace and result, but it's sillier and less respectful, so if that's your cup of tea, have a ball. Otherwise, you may join me in a boycott of this movie. Toodles.",1106438400,2,3642,4.5830769230769235

I have to admit though, El Chupacabra from this movie and the ghosts from The Boo Brothers is scary for my son to watch at nighttime so I don't offer it as a choice at night. In this day and age of foul mouths and violence on TV, I am glad to offer Scooby-Doo as a choice for my son.",1083456000,2,444,3.734042553191489

1899770,4,B0000A02YL,"The Scooby-Doo movies of recent years have been generally warmly welcomed in our household.  They tend to be of two schools:  1) more silly than serious, low on mystery, and catering to a young audience (Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School or Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf come to mind) and 2) more serious than silly, emphasizing mystery, and catering to an older audience (Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island or Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders come to mind).  My wife and I enjoy Scooby-Doo and watch it with our children, but we try to stay away from the sillier films.  This movie, Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico, looked to be of the more serious variety, so we bought it.  Here are my thoughts:
The Animation:  The first thing I noticed was that the movie opens with some nice animation eye-candy.  (Generally, key scenes seem to begin with some startling visual, such as rippling water or flickering flames.)  I thought the quasi-3D animation was a nice change from that seen on some of the previous Scooby-Doo movies.
The Plot:  It is a more serious film:  Fred's friends from Mexico are being terrorized by a monster of local legend prior to the Day of the Dead.  Is the monster real or the fabrication of criminal minds?  What differentiates this from the standard Scooby-Doo plot is the emphasis on the Mexican culture.  Local customs (i.e. Day of the Dead) are introduced and explained.  The folks in the Mexican village are treated respectfully.  The gang and the audience learn some Spanish.  This intimacy with the culture makes the monster's threat more significant.  You do care what happens to Fred's friends and their neighbors.  Initially, the plot seemed rather weak:  the first half of the film deals with tracking a monster and the second half deals with the mystery.  I wanted more mystery, but it seemed to take the gang a long time to realize that some detective work was required.  Upon reflection, I see that the pacing was deliberate to allow the locals to contribute significantly to the gang's detective work; it's a group effort.
The Problem:  I enjoyed this movie until the obligatory chase scene, which grew increasingly incredible.  I thought I had the mystery all figured out--I was disappointed that I was way ahead of Velma so soon--and then found myself confused by the strange events occurring during the chase.  Although all is explained later--and more satisfactorily than in Legend of the Vampire--I thought it was too over-the-top.  It didn't help that the accompanying song grew rather tedious.  Also, it made the movie feel too long.
Overall:  I enjoyed this movie, especially its respect for Mexican culture and the Mexican characters, which, not being dumbed down, reacted normally toward some of the weird events, especially near the end.  I dislike the obligatory chase scene, but I realize that this is for the young audience (my son loved this part).  I would have preferred more mystery, but it does play out rather naturally.  Considering the reactions of both myself and my children, I recommend this latest installment in the Scooby-Doo movie series.  Although it has its flaws, I think it makes for a pretty good time.  Adults will like it, and kids will probably love it.",1066608000,37,3232,4.905904059040591
1899771,5,B0000A02YL,"I've been a fan of Scooby-Doo since about 1978 and I have recently been very unhappy with how Warner Bros. has seemed to destroy everything Hanna Barbera made so great.  Hanna Barbera cartoons have always had a certain feel to them, that was very distinguishable from a Warner cartoon, but since Ted Turner merged with Aol the Scooby franchise has seen some rough times.  Finally, and being a hardcore fan, I can say Finally they have made a good Scooby movie.  While I will always favor the darker, more stark look of the first three series, this atleast has a Scooby feel and plot.  The last movie they put out, Legend of the Vampire, was so misguided it became boring.  This movie, though, has a great feel...and i will even overlook the fact the main monster is a rip off of the old Jaguara!!!
