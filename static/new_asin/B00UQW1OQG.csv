8707909,5,B00UQW1OQG,"I attended the premiere screening of this film in London at the RainDance Film Festival. It is captivating and thrilling yet at the same time romantic. When the ""bad guy"" is more likable than the husband, chicks are going to flip out for this naughty Leading man and question morales and punishments. American Poldark fans will love this character who is a mix of Prince Charming, a bad ass Robin Hood and your favorite home entertainment Chef. Men should treat their wives better after viewing this film, and women should demand it. Riveting film!!!",1445731200,,550,4.861702127659575
8707910,4,B00UQW1OQG,"Ate De Jong brings Mark Rogers' story of fetish, and horror to life in dark, visceral , sometimes uncomfortable intensity. Normally I pass on films that I consider torture porn, or at least I bail on the film once I get that impression. I am glad that I did not check out on ""Deadly Virtues"" because it is definitely a tight, methodical nightmare that pushes one to experience that taboo in the horror genre, the eroticism of sexual nightmares. Much like ""Straw Dogs (the remake)"", this movie goes into those areas and exploits those darker subjects.

""Deadly Virtues"" doesn't completely nail it, there are moments that play out almost like cliche of the erotic horror subgenre. At times the energy falters, and certain moments that could have really pushed the horror over the edge are only mediocre. That being said, the characters are developed more than you usually see in these sorts of stories, the subtext is deep and dark, and the acting is captivating enough to cause you to built a very intense connection with the characters. Plus the ending is one that I didn't quite see coming, made me angry until the ending finally played out- an ending that is well worth setting through the sexual overture that runs through ""Deadly Virtues"", and that sense of discomfort in seeing some of the scenes play out.

Overall, ""Deadly Virtues"" is worth watching on so many levels. I enjoyed being pushed into less comfortable forays of ""what is horror"" and ""what is erotic"". Rogers story balances it nicely and De Jong brings it to scream wonderfully. The special effects are practical, even though they are limited and not a big focal point of the movie. The real focal point of ""Deadly Virtues"" comes from actually watching the film, experiencing this situation through the eyes of these tragic characters, and that ending. This is one of the better, more elevated torture-porn, exploitation, and modern cult films I have seen in a while.  - See more at: http://asouthernlifeinscandaloustimes.blogspot.com/2015/09/my-review-of-deadly-virtues.html#sthash.sCDDBlr8.dpuf",1442448000,,2064,5.136904761904762
8707911,3,B00UQW1OQG,"A man sneaks into a couples house and interrupts them during sex. He binds the man and begins to torture him, meanwhile he seeks to play out a caring relationship with the woman. Thats a pretty interesting idea. You would expect this to lead to a rape/revenge movie but it goes in a much different direction. The intruder feigns a marriage with the woman and when she gets out of line, he tortures her husband. Nice angle. And it works most of the time. Sometimes it gets a little dull, but not too bad. Fair amount of bloodshed, little bit of nudity. The eventual climax to the story I didn't care for at all. Some interesting revelations but the end result was a little too far-fetched. Good acting, nothing great. A solid little movie that tried to do something different and almost fully succeeded.",1442275200,,802,4.576388888888889
