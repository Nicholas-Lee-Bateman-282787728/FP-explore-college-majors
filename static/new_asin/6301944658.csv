390551,4,6301944658,"Dolemite, with Rudy Ray Moore, is a wonderful, remarkably campy film.  Dolemite was an urban legend popularized by Rudy Ray Moore in his stand up comedy routine, and here the legend of Dolemite was made into a movie  which, judging by the terrible acting, awful lighting, and frequent shots  of the boom mic or even the shadow of the camera crew hovering around the  actors, must be one of the finest (or worst) ever made.  To, me, Dolemite  is the first, the finest, and the only mac daddy.  The reason this film  didn't get 5 stars is because it is, though hard to believe, not as  entertaining as its sequel, Dolemite 2: The Human Tornado, in which  Dolemite comes back to massacre white folk and take their women.",915321600,4,717,4.53125

Judged on its merits just as a film against anything else ever made, this is one of the worst movies ever made. There doesn't seem to have been any direction whatsoever. Every single shot was a take in this film, there was no ""you could have done this better"". It was shot from the hip and edited by a blind person. ""That'll do"" is the motto of this film. You can tell that most of the time the actors can barely remember their lines, the lighting is moving all over and the mic pops into the scene many times throughout the movie. And the end result is... glorious. If the cast had tried harder it would have been worse, if the direction had been better, this would have been worse. It's so bad it's good.

And realistically the story is actually quite decent. I do enjoy watching this for the story, even if it is corny and badly made. This is the definition of a cult movie and you should experience it before you die.",1471132800,,1002,4.268421052631579

390641,5,6301944658,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I first heard about DOLEMITE when I was a kid, probably around 10 years old.  My older brother had watched it somewhere (I think at a drive-in) and said it was one of the worst films he had ever seen.  Granted, my older brother is/was not the sharpest tool in the shed, a fact which I knew even back then.  But for some reason I took his word for it, and therefore never gave DOLEMITE a chance.

Fast forward to 2016.  The fine folks at Vinegar Syndrome sent me a copy of the newly restored version of the film for review.  And I gotta tell you:  I wish I had given this movie a chance many years ago.  Its A LOT of fun, and I will definitely be watching it again soon!

If you're not a fan of exploitation films, then youll probably hate this movie.  But if you are a fan, like me, then youll love it.  I rate this one right up there with SCREAM, BLACKULA, SCREAM!

DOLEMITE is one of those films you will find yourself quoting when you least expect it.  Just recently, I was cut off on the interstate while coming home from vacation.  I mumbled, Rat soup eaten mother before I realized what I was saying.  Needless to say, I laughed out loud.

The acting in the film is typical for an exploitation film, but thats part of what makes them so much fun to watch.  Rudy Ray Moore is definitely the baddest pimp on the block, and he portrays the part with gusto.  I love his supporting cast as well, including the kung fu chicks he hangs with.  I couldn't stop laughing during the fight scenesthey were great!

The dialogue in DOLEMITE is a MAJOR reason you should watch the film.  Obviously, its dated (the film came out the year after I was born!), and as such, its hilarious.  I would love to know what the younger generation thinks about this film, as it is probably a far cry from what they are used to these days.

DOLEMITE is a big win for me, and I loved it.  I suggest giving it a look, especially on Blu-ray.  It comes with a great HD picture and quality sound, but it also includes some nice Bonus Features as well.",1464825600,,2096,4.203517587939698

* My friend, who was so giddy about the movie, ended up taking control to steer to the prime bits and avoiding some of the others.  On whole we watched about half of it.

* The women were extremely unimpressed.  After 4-5 drinks they warmed up considerably but in their right minds they were VERY not on board.

* Infinitely quotable.  Even after 20 years my friend still can quote lines from this thing.  It's that kind of classic.

390785,5,6301944658,"Oh Dolemite, Queen Bee, Hamburger Pimp and Mean Willie Green....I'm so happy! Knowing of this movie for like 20 years but neglecting to see it I should kick my OWN @ss twice a day. I knew it was ""bad"", I didn't realize that it was so GOOD! Having seen my beloved John Waters ultra-classic ""Pink Flamingo's"" I felt RIGHT at home with Dolemite the minute I pressed play on my dvd player. The similarity of both films is obvious: the DIY ethic of filming in your own house, improvising parts, using friends and achieving ""high"" art on Schlitz budget and both somehow capturing a moment in time better than many skilled and well financed directors: Black LA in the mid '70's with Dolemite and the Manson Family ethic with Flamingo's. I mean seriously, Hamburger Pimp could EASILY have been in a number of John Waters movies and Cotton could have been a Dolemite ""dancer"". A ""Dolemite vs. Babs Johnson"" sequel? Sniff.. we can only imagine!

But anyway, back to the movie: the lack of editing, acting and filming experience is what REALLY elevates Dolemite. Poor Queen Bee looks like a 50 year old drag queen (I was shocked at how much better she looks in the FAR more professional ""Human Tornado"") and everyone looks sweaty, shiny and fat. Apparently no one knew of film make up techniques at the time! The choppy editing, sloppy karate moves and exTREMEly awkward sex scenes only make the movie more memorable - too memorable, when it looks like Dolemite is mounting you during one of the sex scenes (referred to as the ""Dolemite Cam""!) I had to sleep with my light on for a week! Worth it, as I watched it like 3 times over the weekend strangely compelled to ask questions like ""why is the creeper wearing an inside-out dolemite t-shirt and where can I get one?"" or ""how did Dolemite manage to park that '71 caddy in that tight spot behind Hamburger Pimps house?"" or the classic ""why is he wearing a white jumpsuit in the dressing room BEFORE the show only to change into a white tux FOR the show?"". My only complaint, of course, is that there's an unedited version out there (explaining SOME of the horrific editing in the making-love-to-the-b! tches scenes) and I won't rest until I get myself a copy...and let no rat-soup eating, insecure born mutha get in my way!",1358553600,3,2264,4.603960396039604

390787,5,6301944658,"Usually, we watch a glorious b for the first time and share our vast expertise on b logic and theory. It is the rare film that was seen for the first time over 10 years ago but evoked jaw dropping disbelief that it was a finished product that it must be kept in the National Sid Archives. Obviously when we saw Dolomite years ago we thought it was hilarious. There were a lot of aspects that were familiar but others that our then less trained B eyes didn't pick up. There was the famous Joe Blow line, FBI this is search warrant, and Queen Bee along with the talent wealthy Rudy Ray Moore as Dolomite. You remember these. But what we didn't see back then was how Dolomite paved the way for our beloved b action of the 90's through today. This movie had so many impossible fight scenes with blows missing by at least 3 feet off the mark followed by a 2 second delayed reaction by the guy getting hit, delivered by a guy who clearly always chose a Big Un as a late night snack that it could only remind us of Seagal. This coupled with the fact that Dolomite was an inexplicable ladies man leads us to believe that Seagal has a life sized Dolomite action figure somewhere in his house.

Dolomite starts the movie in prison but is called into the warden's office because he's the only cat bad enough to take down Willie Green, the guy who framed Dolomite and is wreaking havoc on LA. So Dolomite is released to his girls--hos--girls and sent back to his life as a club owner and part time pimp to a bunch of Karate expert hookers. For most of the film, Dolomite is circling Willie Green and getting the low down on his enemy while reacclimating all his ladies to his metalic extension. There's even one scene shot from the girls point of view so you're looking up at Rudy Ray Moore sweating and writhing for 30 seconds. We learn that Dolomite is not only up against Willie but the mayor and his hit squad that includes two crooked cops, one of whom looks like Will Ferrel in Blue Oyster Cult. When they surely have Dolomite boxed in, a helpful FBI agent comes to Dolomite's aid. This guy didn't show up until after the hour mark but knew the whole deal and saved Dolomite's hide. That's how you move merchandise.

Dolomite couldn't be more highly recomended. We enjoyed this one so much that it led to a google search of Dolomite Soundboard. Why we couldn't have found it a few years ago is a tragic riddle. The scene when hitmen went after Dolomite in the hospital was great. Over the hospital's PA system could be heard ""Dr. Feelgood, please report to inhalation therapy."" Ok so that's how this movie had a $100k budget but only 5000 was used for filming. Later in the same scene Dolomite has killed all three hitmen and is standing over their bodies when the two crooked cops entered the room and placed Dolomite under arrest. When Dolomite asked them what the charge was the fifth can of manwich went onto the shelf. That's what you're dealing with with Dolomite, B in its purest form. There was even a scene when the girls were in the dojo for karate practice and the mic was visable for 5 straight minutes. These are the facts that make this movie a 5 star B effort. We implore you to watch Dolomite. How could you not like Dolomite? You grew up on it.",1337731200,4,3255,4.36963696369637

Unlike other films like ""Foxy Brown"" or ""Cleopatra Jones,"" this movie makes no attempt to make blacks dignified upstanding citizens, rather it does the opposite like ""The Mack"" times a million. The Nword is dropped constantly, people refer to each other as motherf***er all the time and so on. Maybe it is more real, maybe not. It certainly is a hilariously over the top run into a world that is rarely visited in this way.

The movie's plot is thin... at worst. Dolemite is a pimpin', club owning, karate master with a legion of trollops who are also karate masters. He was also framed and sent to prison by his archrival pimpin' club owner (this one does not know king-fu as well as Dolemite though). Anyway he is released in order to, well um, stop crime. So, instead he does the opposite and beats a lot of people up. Then he has sex with some strumpets and then he talks to some druggie. He also spills a huge sack of coke on a police officer.

Anyway, the movie ends in a chaotic kung-fu battle and whatever else. The entire movie is hilarious and should be watched only because of the incredibly utile quotes. Here are some good ones:

""You rat soup eating honky motherf***er!""

""Man move over and let me pass 'fore they have to be pulling these hush puppies out your motherf***ing a**!""

Fun... well that is what the movie is. It is horribly politically incorrect.

To the untrained eye, it might seem like Dolemite's karate kicks are not even connecting with his foes, but this is a metaphor for the never ending conundrum of the pimp/poet/warrior.  Watch for the symbolism inherent in the furry hat and pay close attention to the pants that come up to his armpits as both are integral to understanding the magnificence that is Dolemite.

Others here have mocked the presence of the boom mike.  What they do not realize is that the boom mike represents The Man - ever encroaching on the brothers.  Dolemite knows just how to handle the problem: a flurry of karate to moves to show those ""Mutha(expletive)s"" how it is done.

1) The Hamburger Pimp (think of him as a crack-headed, nappy-haired version of Popeye's Wimpy).  And he has his own theme music.

2) This movie contains the greatest single line in cinematic history.

  Just as the two crooked cops (with their sideburns down to here) pull Dolemite over in a futile attempt to frame the baddest motha' around, they taunt, ""You think you're so bad, Dolemite...riding around in your big fancy cars, wearing all them fancy clothes, with all of your black b*tches!"" our hero snaps back with, ""You forgot about the white one!""

They just don't make movies like they used two.  Buy two copies, one to permanently leave in your DVD player.  And the other to put under your pillow when you sleep.

390811,5,6301944658,"I recently had the pleasure of watching a film starring the Hunkiest specimen of Man-meat ever to grace the silver screen. It was Rudy Ray Moore in Dolemite. Let me start off by saying this is quite possibly the finest film ever made. Dolemite himself is a man so baaad that he doesn't even feel the need to be in good shape to impress us, he let's his martial arts do the talkin'. If Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Tony Jaa were all combined into one glorious person they would still aspire to be Dolemite. To the untrained eye it would appear that Dolemite is not actually hitting people in the fight scenes. In reality he is just so fast that he can snap his hands and feet there and back so quickly that it gives the viewer the illusion that his foot is six inches away from the targets head.

This movie also has the flyest honeys ever captured on film. Queen Bee, the leader of Dolemite's kung fu strumpets, somehow manages to become more mesmerizing in each scene.

Dolemite's insults are so cutting that it would make Don Rickles weep uncontrollably. This is a man who knows in order to hurt someone's feelings you need to scream ""muthaf***a"" at the end of every insult. Also to showcase his wit there are five minute poetry reciting scenes. Some would say these scenes are waaay to long and very unnecessary, but that is just plum rediculous. It shows that he is a jack of all trades.

The emotion also runs rampant in this movie. I cried for hours after the tragic and untimely death of the ""Hamburger Pimp"". That's right the ""Hamburger Pimp"". Why hasn't Hollywood thought to name every character in every movie that. This movie is so gritty and real that they decided to make the boom mike visible in numerous scenes just to remind the audience that its just a movie.

All in all, if you see one movie in your entire life make it Dolemite.",1121212800,71,1844,4.430678466076696
390812,4,6301944658,"The story of a good-hearted pimp framed by some dirty cops and his arch-rival Willie Greenand then released from prison so he and his all girl army of kung fu hookers can clean up the streets. Rudy Ray Moore is a stand up comedic genius and I once I became a fan and learned that he had actually made a series of movies based on one of his characters, Dolemite, I had to get it and see it.

This movie is so bad, you can't help loving it. The acting is sub-par, especially from the pair of dirty cops. The camera crew's shadows can be seen, boom mikes can be seen at the top and bottom of the screen, and the lights used to keep the actors lit sometimes move off target and can be seen lighting up the background in an attempt to illuminate their target character.

Despite the poor production values the movie is a riot of laughter almost from start to finish with Rudy (as the titular character Dolemite) delivering some of the funniest dialogue I've heard in a long time. The action scenes, with the kung fu girls against the evil army of Willie Green, are laughable. Dolemite apparently has a cook on his side that you only see in these fight scenes. Dolemite eventually defeats his nemisis by tearing out his heart (perhaps it's his liver because he tears it out of his stomach, and when his FBI agent ally sees this he fires a shot into the corpse to take the blame away from Dolemite, as if no one will notice his heart (liver?) torn out by hand.)

And Dolomite is no clothes horse.  With that big butt and waist he certainly doesn't look like a kung fu master. Pimp?! He's pigeon-toed and walks like Andy Griffith. The love scenes are cut so poorly you'll howl!  The music resembles nothing I ever heard in that era and in the club scenes, the entertainment will have you screaming with their choreography & costumes.

With the overt racism, sophomoric profanity & too many other corny things to count, this movie is great for a laugh when I am bored.  This movie should be on a list with ""Plan X from Outer Space""",1100563200,6,932,4.32183908045977

 Along the way, there are all of the prerequisites for movies of this particular genre, the racist white cops, the pimped out rides, the ""jive sucka"" laced dialogue, the pimped out clothing and lots of T&A.

Even so, this movie is totally and wonderfully great.  It posesses in spades what many hugh blockbuster do not have: soul and inspiration.  Rudy Ray Moore is a middle aged, pretty flabby dude.  By looking at him, I'm simply not going to buy into him being a kung fu master and Don Juan to all the ladies.  But he seems to believe that he is, and this giddy fun manages to translate to the film.
Don't pop in this DVD if you want a well-made, conventional film; ""Dolemite"" sits firmly in cult territory.  For the cult film lover though, it's hard to disparage bad kung fu, kung fu prostitutes, a hero that commits some pretty serious crimes (which the movie wonderfully fails to adress) and strange and bewildering proto-rapping from Moore himself.

Rudy (the big bad Dolemite himself) is hardly a master thespian, but yet every line he puts out in this film is golden, thanks to his keen thinking to add racial slurs in his sentences, or to just simply shout ""MotherF@#KA!"" at the end of it, with a great burst of volume for emphasis.  Not only can Dolemite swear, but he is gifted with horrible kung fu.  Who knew a slow-moving kick could send a 250-pound man flying into the open trunk of your car?

The one thing I love this bout this film is that everyone does their best in spite of the low budget and poor production values. You want to see Rudy Ray Moore get even with Willie Green and those insecure, no business born, junkyard rat soup eating ... And you howl laughing every time he goes into one of his classic ""toasts"" or shoots off a one liner.
 Sure the movie is awful. But the blaring errors only make it better.

390841,5,6301944658,"Dolemite actually hit the big screens in 1973. Note to viewers Dolemite is an extremely cheap low-budget movie. But the film itself is really a pioneering comedy/action that propelled blaxpoitaion to its climax in the mid-to-late 70's. Ironically, even though this movie is labeled as exploitative, It reciprocates the roles of racial dominance, which was unheard of at the time. Ever since Tinsel Town's early days, African-Americans along with other ethnic groups were beat down, slapped, kicked, mauled and were the butt of many jokes. In this movie Rudy Ray Moore is beyond a figure of dominance. The world revolves around him. I honestly think that he was the first African American to reverse the extreme force used against blacks back to the authoritative figures (cops). At that particular time in America, African Americans needed to see films like Dolemite. This movie is loaded with 70's style shock value.
Also, in case you didn't know Dolemite was probably the first person to recite witty rhymes to beats long before the actual birth of hip-hop culture itself in the South Bronx( see DJ Kool Herc). Some of the scenes are a little choppy but this movie ranks with the elite, as far as comedy goes.

Dolemite, in it's purest form, is certainly a movie worthy of anyone's attention. Whether you watch it for the ""skull splitting, brain blasting action"" or for its intellegent and insightful look into the life of a classy pimp in today's cutting-edge empire of prostitution, Dolemite is of a calibur that hasn't been matched since Max Julien's brilliant interpretation of the ""Pimp of the Year"" himself, Goldie ""The Mack"". While Dolemite may not have the finesse of an 80's action hero, such as Malone (played by Burt Reynolds in the brilliant epic directed by Harry Cokliss), without a doubt, his actions illustrate the raw charisma and leadership demanded of a first-class pimp. The fact that Burt Reynolds did not appear in the movie seriously decreased the value of the film.

7818326,5,6301944658,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'Dolemite' released by Vinegar Syndrome in April, 2016.

I'm giving this 5 stars based on the quality of the release and not the quality of the movie production. The extra's are numerous and excellent. I enjoyed the ""Locations: Then & Now"" featurette. I also liked the ""I, Dolemite documentary."" There are quite a few other extra's including a commentary track by Rudy Ray Moore's biographer.

I thought the picture was excellent even though the print itself wasn't exceptional. I'm going to guess that since this was shot on a microscopic budget that what you see is the way it was filmed. The flaws have probably always been there. Of course it's nothing like the restoration's of Hollywood classics but it is very good for ""what it is.""

I picked this up after watching a few other 'blaxploitation' movies. I remember seeing advertisements for these types of movies in the newspapers in New York back when I was a youngster. I always wondered what these movies were like. When I was a kid I imagined these movies to be very violent. Well, they are violent but they are also very funny and the violence never really looks real so you can't take it too seriously.
I watched the 'Shaft' movies along with a few others, each of which are standard DVD quality. I decided to give this one a shot because it looked like it might be interesting.

The movie itself was pretty entertaining. Never taking itself too seriously and often silly. Rudy Ray Moore performs a few skits from his real life stage show. The plot centers around a night club owner, performer and pimp (Dolemite) who is being released from prison to help bring down a drug dealer. That very same drug dealer had Dolemite set up by rival, Willie Green, with help from corrupt cops. Dolemite has been wrongly imprisoned for possession of drugs. Willie Green has taken over Dolemite's nightclub and territroy. Fortunately for Dolemite he has has a loyal, harem (for lack of a better word) who helps him in his quest to bring down Willie Green and get back his turf.

I will be picking up the next movie in Rudy Ray Moore's career, The Human Tornado soon.

Highly recommended for fans of blaxploitation movies and anybody who is a beginner like myself to this genre of movies.",1506038400,2,2277,4.665835411471321

You can't have a ""Blaxploitation"" movie collection (like I have) and NOT have ""Dolemite""!",1487635200,,253,4.7727272727272725
