8673966,4,B00MQLQJDI,"THE MARINE
John Cena plays John Triton, a Marine who was discharged after disobeying a direct order in order to save his fellow soldiers in war. He returns home to his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) and after not being able to adjust to his home life so easily, they take a vacation. Unfortunately John ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time as he crosses paths with a group of jewel thieves at a gas station led by a killer named Rome (Robert Patrick) and after things don't go as planned, they go on the run & kidnap Kate as a hostage. From there, John goes after the thieves to save his wife but encounter many issues along with the way while the thieves have problems of their own such as not being to trust each other & Kate being tougher than she looks.

This is one of those generic action movies where the plot itself was very simple & something the average person can understand. The acting isn't much as Cena had no previous acting experience before this role so his dialog is very limited but did do well & was believable in his role. They have good action scenes from a car chase to fist fights to tons of explosions. The most annoying thing here though was that they tried to add comedy to this movie which didn't work at all such as when the bad guys are in the jungle running from the police...that's not the time to start making jokes about ""rock candy"" & getting calls about their cable TV package although I did get a chuckle as the priceless look Patrick gave after a line that references probably his most famous acting role.

While the DVD included both the unrated & theatrical versions of the movie (I honestly couldn't tell the different between either one), the DVD extras include all the WWE promotional features, footage of the World Premiere, various features on John Cena, and a ""Making Of"" feature.

THE MARINE 2
Joe Linwood (Ted Dibiase Jr.) is a Marine who decides to go on a vacation with his wife Robin (Lara Cox) to an exotic island resort that's owned by a client of hers as everything starts out nice before an attack happens at the grand opening party with all the guest taken everyone hostage including Joe's wife.  From there, Joe is determined to go in & get her but has to deal with the terrorist themselves along with other obstacles like politicians trying to not make this an international incident, a retired Army soldier who doesn't ""want to be a hero"", mercenaries who work for the highest price, and finding out throughout the movie that not everyone can be trusted.

As usual when it comes to sequels, they all get compared to the original as this movie is one of those type of sequels where it has absolutely no connection to the previous movie with the exception of it being a very similar plot so don't expect to see any reference to characters you saw in the first Marine movie.  The only thing this & the previous movie have in common is the story of a Marine being in the wrong place at the wrong time with his wife being taken hostage & with him going to save her but that's it besides that basis along with the involvement of certain elements that go into an action movie.  Dibiase does more ""acting"" as far as dialog than Cena did while his character & the entire environment was more ""realistic"" thanks to more dept & development as far as the story itself goes along with them learning from the first film & not trying to mix bad humor in with the movie. One of the big differences here was unlike how ""The Marine"" had a heavy amount of their action based off explosions, the action here was more diverse as you had a minor amount of explosions with more emphasis on gunfire & fighting using the Muay Thai style.

DVD extras include deleted & extended scenes along with a montage of various deleted shots. Various ""behind the scenes"" features, a look at Ted Dibiase, and various takes of the Muay Thai fights complete the extras.

THE MARINE 3: HOMEFRONT
Mike ""The Miz"" Mizanin stars as Sgt. Jake Carter who returns home to Bridgetown, WA for two weeks to his family of his big sister Amanda (Camille Sullivan) & baby sister Lilly (Ashley Bell) along with his friend & who he later finds out is Amanda's boyfriend in Officer Harkin (Jared Keeso) but is critical & overprotective of certain issues going on such as Lilly's boyfriend Darren (Jeffrey Ballard). Lilly & Darren later witness a shooting during an arms deal with Jonah Pope (Neal McDonough) before being taken hostage by his group of extremists which Jake finds out about & goes after her but encounters difficulties along the way such as F.B.I. agents Wells (Steve Bacic) & Thompson (Nicola Anderson) who attempt to stop him from interfering in their own mission to stop Pope from committing a deadly terrorist strike.

The basic plot for this movie was no different than the previous editions where it's an off-duty marine going after the group of villains who kidnapped someone close to him so that hasn't changed but the way it was portrayed takes after the previous sequel where it's a more realistic & serious tone instead of over the top acting & action like the first installment. The action was your basic fist fighting & gun play while this had the best acting out of ""The Marine"" trilogy as Miz did a good job while I've enjoyed Neal McDonough's work in various movies as well. This is definitely worthy of a rental while it's a movie I wouldn't mind watching more than once.

12 ROUNDS
New Orleans cop Danny Fisher (John Cena) along with his partner Hank Carver (Brian J. White) are out on partol when they cross paths with arms dealer Miles Jackson (Adian Gillen) & his girlfriend Erica Kessen (Taylor Cole) who were on the run from a an F.B.I. sting gone bad earlier in the night before he was eventually captured but unfortunally resulted in Erica's death in the process.  Fast forward a year later when Miles escapes from prison & seeks revenge on Danny kidnapping his girlfriend Molly Porter (Ashley Scott) & forcing him to participate in a game called ""12 Rounds"" where he must perform series of task within a certain time limit or lose Molly & possibly his own life but has another problem with F.B.I. agents George Aiken (Steve Harris) & Ray Santiago (Gonzalo Menendez) getting involved with Aiken having a personal vendetta against Jackson & wants to get him no matter who or what is sacrificed in the process including Fisher's girlfriend.

This movie has a similar plotline like Cena's previous movie ""The Marine"" where it's the good guy chasing after the bad guy who kidnapped his girlfriend but will also remind you of ""Die Hard With A Vengance/Die Hard 3"" in that the villian is seeking revenge for a personal death caused resulting in him forcing the hero to perform a series of difficult physical task.  12 Rounds didn't come off as a dated B-level generic movie as it made a good mix of action along with different levels of plot & character development.

DVD extras include a feature on the movie stunts, a gag reel, 2 alternative endings with alternative commentary from John Cena along with writer Daniel Kunka...who also did alternative commentary on the movie, and another alternative movie commentary with the director Renny Harlin complete the extras.

In the end, first Marine was a good old action flick that you used to see back in the 80's that was heavily based on explosions & fist fight scenes while the sequels were more ""plot"" driven along with 12 Rounds being a very similar movie but filled with more action & better acting. In the end, all the movies are worth taking a look at.",1421712000,,7548,4.58
