8292711,5,B00005LW3K,"I first came across Gary Potter by accident in a small town in north west Wales. This was about 8 years ago and my wife suggested we drop into the local art gallery where this jazz guitarist was performing. I'm so glad I did. Within about 20 seconds of his opening number I knew I was listening to somethig special.

Since then I have picked up all of his Cds and the Hotter than Hot DVD. It's filmed in a small club in Wrexham, N Wales and straight away manages to capture the informal and personal nature of the place. Gary plays with his acoustic trio. He is on lead, Nils Solberg on rhythm and I think Andy Crowdy on bass.

The standard of musicianship is excellent and showcases the complete brillance of Potter on the guitar. He runs through gypsy jazz and latin jazz numbers with equal virtuosity. Any guitar or jazz lover will enjoy this recording equally well and it is the next best thing to seeing the guy play in person.
