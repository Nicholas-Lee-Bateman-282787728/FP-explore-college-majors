8053882,5,B0007Y7TTY,I always loved Mr. Big and was sorry to see them part ways. This show clearly demonstrates the vast energy and amazing interaction the band had with each other to create some kick ass music! BUY IT!!!,1139788800,,200,4.4324324324324325
8053883,2,B0007Y7TTY,"Everything about the Concert was great with the exception of the extremely poor picture. The picture was unfocused and fuzzy. During Billy's bass solo the brightness from the spotlight washes out the picture ... so much so you really can not see what he is playing. The DVD is packaged in a CD jewel case and sounds great. However, I would recommend purchasing a CD over spending the money for the DVD due to the poor picture.",1120867200,6,426,4.545454545454546
