While involving a fairly serious subject (kidnapping) this movie was pretty funny.  Ariadna Gil played it straight and was very good.",1330905600,,259,5.45
8015887,3,B0001O3YJO,"As a big fan of Spanish Cinema and the Trueba Bothers (Fernando for Belle Epoque), I didn't want to give it only 3 stars. The setup was entertaining, the ending, thought-provoking. Problem I had was the middle. The story seems to deviate from the main character, Amanda Castro (Gil), and goes into some subplot about the deviante behavior of another character (Segura's). I found it to be repetative and boring. Did we really need to see Segura's charcacter pleasure himself in front of his father while watching a video of his mother or step-mother? Guess I found that act alone repulsive and didn't feel it added to the dynamics of the story.

Gil, of course, is great as usual. She never ceases to surprise me. If for anything, watch it because of her. she does a good job of playing a washed out, drug infested actress.",1097020800,2,823,4.636986301369863
