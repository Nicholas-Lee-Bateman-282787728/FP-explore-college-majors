1706304,3,B0000648Z4,"It;s supposed to be an awesome TV series about Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"" ( ""Chinese Connection"" in US) played by Donnie Yen. I saw the whole series on TV. But cramping it into one 2 hour movie?!! it's not easy at all. The story line is still good (of course it's still way far if you compare it with the real 27 series/ episodes) but you can catch the resumed story. Fighting scenes are awesome but I agreed that they fastforward it as about 2-3XX on your DVD. Donnie is fast but not that fast. He was a world Tai Chi Champion. I love him in certain way he's better than Bruce Lee, in other ways, Bruce Lee is much better than him, so he just did that movie coz he appreciate Bruce Lee and Chen Jen legend. It's a tribute to Bruce Lee. Not trying to make a copycat at all. So just enjoy it as the movie itself, don't compare it to Fist of Fury by Bruce Lee (Chinese Connection), Jackie Chan (The New Fist of Fury) or Jet Lee (Fist of Legend). They all have their own positive and negative side.

  I just dissapointed with the back cover of this DVD, the show the scenes which is not in the DVD at all. They are the Korean kickboxer and Chen Jen's senior who is jealous to Chen Jen. That was two great fighting scenes in this movie but the just hook me up on the back cover, I didn't find it at all in the movie.

  Overall if you don't see the TV series, don't judge Donnie Yen and this movie,  this is a pretty good movie. Thanks.",1094774400,3,1433,4.060283687943262
1706305,2,B0000648Z4,"I think Donnie Yen is a kung fu god but this movie falls so far short it is a huge disappointment. The movie is based on a television series in China and the story is actually not that bad, although it seems a little crammed together. The fighting is great, full of style and power, but what ruins it and the rest of the movie is the horrible production of the film. I think every fight scene is sped up to the point of ridiculous(I am NOT exaggerating at all). It is as if you had your DVD player on 4x fast foward. What could have been an awesome fight scene when Donnie Yen wields some nunchuks and works a room full of bad guys is ruined by this! Also, if you watch it dubbed in english, when Yen fights he never shuts up! He will literally yell Woo, woo, woo, woo... for 60 straight seconds! The most evident flaw is the type of film that is used. I am not joking, it is the same film quality as a soap opera. It doesn't even look like a movie! It looks like it belongs on TV during the day when only your mom is home to watch her stories!

(and it is full screen)

 If you can get passed all I just said it could be a really cool flick. Too bad I can't and you probably can't either.",1090627200,,1189,3.9665271966527196
1706306,4,B0000648Z4,"I know stalwart Bruce Lee fans won't like this movie, and after discovering that this is, in fact, a 25+ TV episode series crammed into a 4-hour movie, it explains a lot.  I'll be looking for the VCDs if I can find the entire series.  Donnie Yen is a bloody kung fu god.
Criticize the story.  It's long and drawn out.  But if it's a TV series, it makes more sense.  The theme-- revenge and more revenge-- goes on and on.  The story in Fist of Fury: Sworn Revenge prequels the story in Bruce Lee's classic film, and tries to pay homage to Bruce Lee's memory.  Thematically, it does this, discussing things like freedom from rigid forms and stances.  The movie as presented on this DVD/Video sets up the story that we are more familiar with-- death of master, Japanese incursion on Chinese turf, etc..
I'm still trying to figure out if Fist of Fury and Fist of Fury: Sworn Revenge are actually separate DVDs here in the States.  My take is that Fist of Fury (no Revenge) is the actual remake of Bruce Lee's film.  I haven't seen that yet.
Martial arts-wise, what can you say?  Numerous, long fight scenes.  Donnie Yen is fabulous.  The supporting cast is very strong kung fu-wise.  The choreography is wonderful.  The action is fast, sped up a little, but not so much that you can't follow it-- as in some HK-based kung fu films.  And I suspect they didn't speed it up THAT much.  Donnie is just plain fast.
Some reviewers claim the fight scenes aren't realistic.  Hello?  The movie isn't about realism.  Few kung fu movies are.  Heck, Bruce Lee's movies aren't about realism.  It's about movies-- showmanship.  But drink up the kung fu.  It's gorgeous to behold.  If you actually study kung fu, watching practically any ""classic"" kung fu movie is a treat-- you understand why they emphasize the flying leaps, or how a kick sends the opponent skidding backwards along his feet, without losing balance.  It's all cinematic interpretations of ideal principles.  Donnie Yen is just plain fabulous, and the other principals are premiere kung fu masters, too.  I was salivating and jealous over their skill.
I don't expect these types of movies to be awesome storywise.  You want that, you can compromise your kung fu standards with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Hero gives both story and kung fu.  This was great for seeing Donnie and Co. strut their stuff.
Nobody can be Bruce Lee.  Some of the reviewers critiqued Donnie for trying.  Give me a break.  Donnie is BETTER in terms of kung fu.  Bruce had his own style, his own way of doing things.  Bruce couldn't do what Donnie does.  Donnie can't quite be Bruce.  In fact, I liked less the fight scenes where Donnie starts bouncing around like a boxer, and trying to imitate Bruce's more boxing-based JKD.  But I loved Donnie just plain kung fu fighting.  Give me a DVD with Donnie just doing forms, and I'd be in heaven.",1079827200,10,2869,4.615079365079365
1706307,1,B0000648Z4,"My goodness!! I expected more than this from Donnie Yen after seeing 'Iron Monkey' part 1. Just too much camera tricks to enjoy the beauty of martial art physical skill. In closing,you cant redo the famous painting ""Sun Flowers"" buy Van Gough,and expect to resell it as the original. I know its harsh,but there is only one 'Fist of Fury"" ,also done by an original master in his field.",1054339200,2,384,4.579710144927536
1706308,4,B0000648Z4,"I know this movie was originally a tv series spanning about 28 episodes.  How Tai Seng managed to cram all that into 120 minutes is beyond me.  But what I saw made sense, probably because I already knew the original Bruce Lee storyline.  I have never seen the original Donnie Yen episodes, only this very editted version, so I cannot be bias and say that this movie [stunk] compared to the tv series.  Until I can somehow get my hands on the tv series, I'll have to be content with this movie version.  I thought overall it was rather enjoyable, though I did think that the storyline did jump around quite a bit.  What I was looking at was mostly the fighting, which I thought was great.  Other than some of the fights being ridiculously sped up, I thought it was up to the Donnie Yen standard.  Yen blends his own style and Bruce Lee's style, most notably the Hiyaa-wah sounds.  Being a big fan of Bruce Lee's ""Fist Of Fury"" and Jet Li's ""Fist Of Legend"", Yen's version isn't bad at all.  I am hoping to find the 28 episode series soon, so I can better understand the full story of Yen's retelling of Chen Jen and the Ching Wu school.",1023321600,,1135,4.311320754716981
1706309,3,B0000648Z4,"WHY????!!! If you have seen the entire ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 28 episode T.V. Series then there is absolutely no reason to purchase this DVD. If you haven't seen the entire series and you don't feel like spending [money] to purchase it(depending on where you buy it), then definitely buy this DVD just for the amazing Donnie Yen who respectfully pays homage to Bruce Lee and pulls off some pretty spectacular fight scenes. You will also probally be annoyed that any semblance of a plot that originally took 28 episodes to unfold is quite noticeably absent. The score is ripped from Dragon:The Bruce Lee Story and there is a piece that begins with the first few bars from the Enter the Dragon theme song. Over all 28 hours worth of footage sliced, diced and crammed into 120 minutes. If you are a serious martial arts film fan then purchase the entire VCD set. Most DVD players also play VCD's. It is more than well worth it.",1022284800,,922,4.628048780487805
1706328,5,B0000648Z4,"A lot of people do not like movies that are english dubbed, I think that english dubbed movies are great especially this one. Once you start watching it you do not realize that it is dubbed.",1375315200,,190,4.305555555555555
1706329,5,B0000648Z4,"... wonderful!... in the age of mma when every second idiot would reduce the gift of martial ARTS to mere functional brutality ( akin to reducing 2,000 years of western architecture to a microwave tower... or the Socratic method to the state schools system...), these films are a breath of fresh air... of course, fantasy... thats the point... performing art embedded in a rich cultural milieu and inspirational context... the chinese were doing no rules, bare knuckle mma 2,000 years ago... they grew out of it...realised they were decimating their talent pool...and okinawan kempo... pure fighting, but think... okinawans are the longest living race on the planet, but their karate masters generally die in their 60/70's... obviously something wrong with training methodolgy... choreography?.... expression of pursuit of a philosophic ideal, aesthetic principles and psychosomatic possibilities... bugger the realists... contemporary incarnation of the flat earth society... right up there with the political correctness clowns... peace y'all",1372118400,,1044,5.741935483870968
1706330,4,B0000648Z4,"This is a very long movie and is a prequel to Fist of Fury. Donnie Yen does a brilliant copy of Bruce Lee (his idol) in this movie.  There is sadness, despair, jealously, frustration, anger and a lot of fighting.  I had to watch one disc one night and the other disc the next morning because I was so tired after the first one and so was more refreshed and could appreciate the action in the second disc more.  This one is definitely a keeper.",1338768000,,443,4.188235294117647
1706331,1,B0000648Z4,"Even if you don't consider Bruce Lee, this is one of the most disappointing martial arts movies I have seen. A couple of fights scenes are okay, but the overall quality of the movie is simply . . . bad! In fact some of the fight sequences look as though they have been sped up. They're like older movies, where everyone moves faster than they would normally would (when it looks unnatural) -  that's this movie.

I'm a big Donnie Yen fan (based mainly on his IP Man movies) and bought this without seeing it. A big mistake. After about 20-30 minutes of watching this, I found myself fast-forwarding to the action sequences because it was so bad. Then I was disappointed in those as well.

Cinematography, story, acting, action, sound, music . . . all poor.

Watch another martial arts movie and STAY AWAY from this ""stinker.""",1308873600,,825,4.554054054054054

I am the biggest Donnie Yen Fan, but mate, embarrassing. One kick and 15 blockes fly off come one man really.",1300752000,,330,4.171875
1706333,4,B0000648Z4,"Just So You Know This is a 3 hour movie and is the prequel to Fist Of Fury The Legend Lives On This Movie SWORN REVENGE just focuses about Chen Jun Having revenge for his sister's death and finds A teacher named Fok Yun Gap AND DOES NOT INCOULD the death of Fok yun Gap or Chen's revenge to the Japenese. That Movie Is Also On Amazon And is called Fist Of Fury The Legend Lives On.

This Is A great Movie with lots of long fight sequences.
I recommend this to any martial artist or Bruce Lee Fans",1297555200,,496,4.01010101010101
1706334,4,B0000648Z4,"This is actually an edit of the 25 episode TV series Donnie Yen starred in called Fist of Fury.  I wanted to point that out because the previous reviews thinks this is a standalone movie or gives that impression.  This is not the case.  This is essentially a part 2 to condensing the TV series.  Think of the recent 'recap' DVDs put out for shows [most noted, Heroes].  Part 1 is Fist of Fury: Sworn Revenge.  I give this 4 out of 5 because the series was a stage for Donnie Yen's range to shine through early in his career as an actor.  I recommend this for any recent Donne Yen fan [especially in light of recent films SPL, Dragon Tiger Gate and the upcoming Flashpoint formerly called City With No Mercy] or fans that haven't seen his TV work.  The commentary is a nice bonus for fans of hearing how scenes were put together and the ideas for doing what they did.  If you can, try to get ahold of the actual full 25 eps.  Pretty sure eng subbed versions are really rare.",1174262400,,973,4.239130434782608
1706335,1,B0000648Z4,"Out of all the Huo Yuan Jia and his student Chen Zhen films - this is by far the worst.  I am so glad that Donnie has come to be a much better actor - it's a wonder anyone would cast him after this role... bad acting overshadowed his kung fu talent.  The saddest part - this movie had a large budget and still couldn't compare to any of the old movies or series.  Worse there is NOTHING original about this version - NOTHING.  A matter of fact if you have seen the Bruce Lee version you may notice some of the same camera angles!! PS Chen Zhen never had a Japanese girlfriend (in case you were wondering).  All I can say, in the words of Chen Zhen (Donnie Yen) ""WOOOOOO OOOO WO OW WOO - Stay away!""",1154649600,,698,4.028985507246377
1706336,1,B0000648Z4,"After Bruce Lee's death, there were a motley crew of imposters trying to jump on the fame band wagon of the ""Dragon"", there was Bruce Le, Bruce Li and Dragon Le, some were good most were corny, but they were given some note of credibility; to an occidental audience due to the well known actors who worked with them in these films, (this is what made Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle a hit, by using wen Wo Ping as choreographer and veteran actors and real masters like Chiu Chi Liang and Yuen Wah.

  The most incredible thing about Bruce Lee is that some of his fight movements had to be slowed down in order to be visible to the audience,

 hence shooting scenes were the camera is obviously speeded up cheapens the integrity of the kung fu, such as in this mediocre flik and the overated Iron Monkey.",1137283200,,801,4.385135135135135
1706337,4,B0000648Z4,"I finally got my hands on Donnie Yen's Fist of Fury: Sworn Revenge, which was pushed as a prequel to Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection and his own version of Fist of Fury, and I was breathless behind the storyline, the colorful characters, the Cantonese w/t English subtitles setup(authenticity), the special affects and the action. What we have here is an awesome foundation for the storyline feautured in Bruice Lee's Fist of Fury(Chinese Connection). However, the only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was because: (1)to quote another post, it did look more like a day time soap than an actual kung-fu flick, but with all the action, the setup becomes obsolete(lol), (2)Sworn Vengeance is somewhat of a prequel and companion to Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury, but is a much better companion to Donnie Yen's Fist of Fury considering the fact that Yen's FOF features more prior to the death of Chen's master before the famous burial scene(TEACHER! TEACHER!!!), and (3)While I enjoyed the efx, it DID look like they were fast fwd'g the action to make it look like Yen was faster than he was. Nonetheless, we have a REAL, modern day tribute to Bruce Lee's work in Fist of Fury. However, Sworn Vengeance is more of a companion to Yen's FOF than to Lee's...for a TRUE companion to Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection(Fist of Fury) I STRONGLY recommend Bruce Li's Chinese Connection 2(Fist of Fury 2). I also recommend Fist of Legend(Jet Li) which is another modern remake of Fist of Fury, but with a different twist. But to make a long story short...Fist of Fury:Sworn Vengeance + Fist of Fury = SUPERB!!! Bruce Lee would be proud!",1114128000,3,1611,4.716312056737588
