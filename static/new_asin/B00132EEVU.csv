3101461,4,B00132EEVU,"Andrea Beaman is an absolute pleasure to watch!  She explains (in easy detail) how to get started, what you need (not a gourmet kitchen!), what vegetables are entailed (their personalities & properties), and shows how to prepare many dishes.  Her enthusiasm, humor and laid back demeanor combined are a breath of fresh air in the teaching world, as they leave you with a desire to learn more.  She is quite knowledgeable in the field of nutrition and passionately shares her work...  This DVD is a worthy purchase...",1242864000,9,516,4.896551724137931

3101463,5,B00132EEVU,"I thought this DVD was a great introduction to cooking and to healthy cooking.  Andrea, the woman doing the demos was cheerful and enthusiastic and showed basic kitchen tools she thinks are helpful, and also talked about different kinds of healthy foods and how to prepare them healthfully - from vegies to meats and vegetarian options, etc.  A LOT of good ideas, and a lot of information for anyone interested in learning about healthy grains and vegies they aren't familiar with.",1207353600,17,481,4.925925925925926

8248826,5,B00132EEVU,Andrea Beaman is extremely knowledgable and makes information about food and wellness easily accessible. She offers great tips and tricks in this DVD. I use it often as gifts for my health coaching clients.,1403568000,,206,5.088235294117647
8248827,5,B00132EEVU,I'm so glad I bought this. I have been trying to get on the right track and eat better but it's always been a challenge - this definitely helped with that,1387756800,,154,4.0
8248828,5,B00132EEVU,"Good way to learn about healthy cooking. Helped me get over cooking with tofu, and learned how to cook some new grains that I had no idea about beforehand.",1376697600,,155,4.379310344827586
8248829,4,B00132EEVU,"It's a good dvd and I've really liked giving them to clients as free gifts.  the recipes are good and easy to follow but I've been paying $15 for the dvd's.  Now I'm out of my stock and need to purchase more but $119....really?  Clearly, this must be a mistake?",1372723200,,261,4.18
8248830,5,B00132EEVU,I love how easily she explains everything and how she shows how to cook whole foods. The recipes are delicious! A must for those leery about how to start cooking more whole foods at home.,1363824000,,187,4.371428571428571
8248831,5,B00132EEVU,"I love this video it shows you good cooking techiniques and delicious recipes. Andrea Beaman is the host and she is so knowledgable about food and a great demostrator. The DVD comes from the School for Integrative Nutrition. I am a student there and I can't say enough good things about this school. Joshua Rosenthal is the founder and through the school he has and will continue to transform our health. He teaches us that health is much more than food, relationships, career, exercise and spirituality also play a key role in nourishing us. I love the program, I have learned so much and I can't wait to share!",1334361600,2,612,4.623853211009174
8248832,5,B00132EEVU,Andrea Beaman is so entertaining while she explains how to prepare healthy meals.  I buy this DVD to hand out to clients (am a certified health coach) so they have something at home to help them maintain their healthy new habits.,1329264000,,229,4.585365853658536
8248833,3,B00132EEVU,"This DVD is good for everyday healthy cooking with use of whole and interesting ingredients. The recipes look flavorful and delicious. The ingredients are not good for the everyday person however. While I find tempeh and tofu exciting, many may not.

Part way in, I was very disturbed when she said soba is gluten free. This could be very dangerous. Tradionally, soba is made from buckewheat, but most varieties available are a mixture of wheat and buckwheat, rendering it not gluten free.",1323302400,2,489,4.963414634146342
8248834,5,B00132EEVU,"The first time that I came across Andrea Beaman was when I was attending the Institute for Integrative Nutrition.  She is very informative and knowledgeable but she also presents the material in a ways that is engaging and fun.  Plus, her recipes are outrageously delicious!

I found that the best part of this was that she not only told you exactly what to do with the food while she was cooking it right there easy for you to see (unlike some of the cooking shows on TV where they do it so quick, you don't even know what they did) but she also explains the reason why you need to.  For example, with all bean, soaking them neutralizes the phytic acid and enzyme inhibitors, and breaks down simple sugars, making the beans more digestible... so it is easier to be around people after eating beans... if you know what I mean :)

This is definitely worth the purchase.  Some other great material to check out if you like Andrea Beaman and Healthy Cooking is Healthy Shopping (I forget who it is by) and Integrative Nutrition by Joshua Rosenthal.
