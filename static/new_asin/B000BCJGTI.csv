If you have money to burn---I watched it [them] once---it DOES help to complete
a shelf of OTHER videos in my home theatre. At MY age, and ten years later, I
cannot recall what I had for breakfast... or anything about either of these movies",1392854400,2,326,4.7368421052631575
8085106,4,B000BCJGTI,"I picked this up also at a ""Dollar Store"" forgot which one,
but for the price this isn't bad.  ""Beatniks"" is not actually about those
bearded characters called beatniks. (I suspect the title was changed to
capitalize on the publicity some of these guys were getting) Most already know
the plot, I will instead focus on the films lead, Tony Travis, a fine singer
who probably deserved better.  He recorded for RCA-Victor and Verve, the latter
label put out a fine LP of standards with a swinging approach, that was re-issued
on CD. Film buffs might be interested in the fact that in the TV studio scene
the audience was shown in stock shots re-printed in black and white which were
taken from the Benny Goodman Story. Musical support in this film was top-notch
all the way, supervised by Stanley Wilson, later of numerous MCA/Univeral TVseries, who gave many composers and musicians work, Benny Carter, John Williams,
and others too numerous to mention.  The supporting cast isn't bad either.

Now, about ""Wild Guitar"".  One video guide referred to it as top contender for
the worst film ever made. Well, It could be.  The music is certainly not at the
professional level of the other film. Arch Hall Sr. who usually acted under a
pseudonym, was decent as the promoter. The rest of the cast is hardly memorable
with the exception of the guy, who told Arch Hall Jr.'s  character that he was
a past victim of the promoter. He did well with little to work with.  My tip
for this film is have several drinks and then watch it.  You might even wind
up tapping your foot to the amateurish music.

Has anyone out there discovered a DVD with better prints of either film?",1371513600,,1662,4.622448979591836
8085107,3,B000BCJGTI,"The Beatniks (1960)

  Wild Guitar (1962)

  Guitar-carrying, motorcycle rider, Bud Eagle (Arch Hall Jr) rides into Hollywood, California for a chance at reaching stardom as a singer. In a cafe, he meets Vicki (Nancy Czar) who as luck would have it has a sandwich for him and she's about to appear on a television show tonight. She invites Bud along. The only singing experience Bud has is with his singing group, Beerfish, in South Dakota.
  The singer for the tv show suddenly gets sick so they need a replacement quick. So a low-budget films go, Vicki pipes up and mentions Bud. In 30 seconds flat, Bud is about to appear on Television for the first time ever (What no SAG or AFTRA card?).
  Bud is a smash. Mr. McCauley (Arch Hall Sr, his real-life father), is a cheap-skate record producer who takes Bud under his wings, but he is rough on Bud. He gives him a home to live in, but secretly gets rid of Vicki so Bud will never see her again.
  Will Bud like his success and find the girl he likes?

  Director Ray Dennis Steckler also has a part in the film. ""Marge""--the waitress was played by Marie Denn.

  Many Hollywood landmarks are seen in this 1962 film.

  Look for the in-joke, ""Fairway records"". This is a Filmway-International film.

  Also there is an EEGAH! poster you will see on the wall.

Arch Hall Jr.'s film ""Wild Guitar"" is a true cult classic, and is especially endearing to anyone  that has played, recorded or has been around the music business.

Filmed in 1962 on (what I'm guessing was) a shoestring budget (and produced by Arch's dad), it's filled with every ""show business is bad"" and ""everyone in the music business is crooked"" cliche in the book... but sadly, the cliches are all true.

The acting isn't terrible, and actually, the characters are fairly likeable (or dislikeable, depending on who is doing what for or to whom at the moment).

The music is typical early 60's fare, but the film is set in Los Angeles, and it's a lot of fun to see what all the old landmarks looked like back then.

It's a fairly well paced film, with some great villains (watch for ""Steak"", Bud Eagle's gangster ""bodyguard"", who also happens to be the film's director!), and there are plenty of ""pretty girls"", pompador haircuts, pegged jeans, Danelectro and Fender guitars, and more retro stuff than you can shake a stick at.  Definately a LOT of fun for very little money.  The transfer quality of this incredibly low cost DVD isn't too bad either.

Well, that's about all the B grade 60's rock cult classics I can handle for one night... I'll check out ""The Beatniks"" tomorrow night!  :)",1195516800,2,1407,4.592
