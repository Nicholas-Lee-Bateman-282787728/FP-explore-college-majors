4429068,2,B004MA1K2Q,Pretty horrible story about violent undeveloped minds of three kids from disadvantaged backgrounds thinking they can survive outside of society in the desert and committing all manner of atrocities.  No remorse for murder.,1438041600,,222,5.7272727272727275

4429073,5,B004MA1K2Q,"I loved this movie. Simple as that. You can read the plot summary elsewhere, as well as people picking it apart on various aspects. I just enjoyed this movie thoroughly and wouldn't change anything about it. A bit dark and raw, and left me feeling uneasy, but that's nice sometimes.",1414713600,3,282,4.66

4429075,5,B004MA1K2Q,"DESERT SON: Is like taking ""Lord of the Flies,"" putting it on steroids, and then setting it out in the desert to bake! The young talented cast and crew radiates a powerful creative energy that is unadulterated. Desert Son is a gritty, action packed, thriller that spirals down to a exhilarates and surprising ending! Nathan Halliday won ""Best Supporting Actor"" (MethodFest Film Festival) for his chilling intense and dark role as Jack. The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful and the locations are shot in authentic California desert Ghost Towns.
Bottom line - This film exhilarates you like the feeling one has the very first time you learn to ride your bike after Dad takes off the training wheels! You feel yourself being pushed off, not sure how it will end, taking you to the very edge.... and then pushing you over it!

8435772,3,B004MA1K2Q,Unfortunately this hits too close to home these days. These children are unwanted and unloved having to fend for themselves. Nothing in this movie is edifying to watch or even a little bit light-hearted. Very sad.,1489536000,,213,4.944444444444445

8435781,5,B004MA1K2Q,"5 Stars doesn't necessarily mean ""I love it"", but the movie is quite interesting.  Unfortunately, like most movies in the millennium the end of Desert Son is normal crap, leaving the viewer to wonder what happened.  An unjust compensation also is in the composition of the TV episodes, which seem to go on and on, but never going anywhere.  Wonders, at what the producers and writers are really trying to accomplish.  This movie could be classified as a horror movie, with a monster named Jack, and his morbid sidekick, Lucy.",1483747200,,525,4.8
