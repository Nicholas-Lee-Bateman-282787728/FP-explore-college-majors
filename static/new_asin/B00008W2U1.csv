1864584,4,B00008W2U1,"I  recently received Robin Hood of the Pecos(1941) from Amazon this year. It's a thoroughly enjoyable Roy Rogers/Gabby Hayes Western romp for its time, directed by Joseph Kane. I am 65 and the last time I saw it was in the 1950's in the theater. It is filled with a lot of good humor and action, although based on a story of the post Civil War efforts to heal the tragic and deep wounds between the brother and sisters of the North and South. The dialogue is fast-paced,funny and the action is nonstop. Any songs are in the background or sung by Roy for story continuity. This is an unusual Rogers western in that he and Gabby act outside the established law- the territorial governor, Ambrose Ballard(Cy Kendall)), who is ruthless and corrupt. Roy and Gabby's characters hang out with the likes of outlaws Sam and Belle Starr( who is played by Sally Payne almost as a giddy  teenager married to an adult Sam Starr, rather than  the mature Belle Starr character  played by Jane Russell in a later  Randolph Scott movie). A Calvary leader who comes to town  tries to enact amnesty for the southern people in the  territory to right things and is killed by one of Ballard's assistants when he accidentally discovers some of Ballard's illegal financial dealing records. In turn,Gabby, Roy, Sam,Belle and their gang  are blamed and framed for the officer's murder. They are chased out of town; some are shot;some are captured and jailed and sentenced to be shot by a firing squad.

Based on the storyline, some of the words used to describe Native Americans, Chinese, and African-Americans are not politically correct by today's standards. So be warned. Nevertheless one of the most entertaining actors in the movie is an African-American, Leigh Whipper. He is a scene-stealer. He was in Of Mice and Men in 1939; The Ox-Bow Incident with Henry Fonda; appeared in Mission to Moscow as Haile Selassie with Walter Huston; and in Peter Gunn, the tv series. Mr. Whipper provides much of the comic relief that Gabby would normally provide. He interacts with Belle Starr and takes pride in ""having raised her from a pup""; he is a hoot with the judge  at the kangaroo court trial for the so-called seditionists; and he plays a key role in smuggling Roy in and out of the presence of  Ballard's henchmen. If you like Roy,Trigger and Gabby(no Dale this time), you will like this little Roger's gem.",1364342400,3,2384,4.720481927710844
