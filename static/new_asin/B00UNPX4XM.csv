7063733,5,B00UNPX4XM,Nemirovsky's fiction is being read  today even though she wrote her works over seventy years ago. This movie of  Suite Ffrancaise resonates in a different way to the novel. What the other reviewer has missed is the little notes which the decent German officer is given written by the local  French villagers which repeated slanderous allegations against their neighbours. Nemirovsky came from a wealthy Russian background used whose family because of the Russian Revolution became emigres living in Paris and yet in Suite Francaise brilliantly to convey  the effect on rural  French society of a brutal Army of Occupation .The movie captures the contrast between the outward symbol of  Germany with its military uniforms the pride of a superior society and underneath the capricious behaviour  of its soldiers  as graphically demonstrated in the dialogue in the scene whilst they are  bathing in the river.when these officers are not wearing their uniforms.,1438646400,2,957,5.28476821192053
7063734,4,B00UNPX4XM,"Set in France at the beginning of World War II we meet Lucille (Michelle Williams - `My week with Marilyn') who is living with her Mother in Law (Kristen Scott-Thomas) in the little town of Bussy just outside Paris. The Wehrmacht have unleashed their blitzkrieg and destroyed the French Army - Petan is announces the surrender. Then the Germans roll in and take over - even changing all the clocks to be on German time.

This involves the common soldiery to be billeted with the local populace. Lucile gets a Lieutenant Bruno van Falk (Matthias Schoenaerts - `Bullhead') and despite their differences a romance blossoms between them. This is set against the backdrop of all the nasty goings on that happened during that conflict.

This is part made by BBC Films and so is a very good production, the period detail is excellent as is all of the acting. The CGI is also very good and the uniforms and materiel are all spot on. This is not a war film as such though - it uses the war as context. It is one of those films that is eminently watchable and will carry you along with it. It does start off really well and then loses a bit of oomph towards the end, but that is not a deal breaker as this is essentially a very good piece of film making - recommended.",1438387200,30,1258,4.394849785407725
7063735,4,B00UNPX4XM,"REVIEW - BLU-RAY ...
It's 1940 France has fallen to the German war machine, 'Paris' is occupied, thousands flee, in vain as the occupation
becomes complete.
'Lucille' (Michelle Williams) lives with her mother-in-law 'Madame Agellier' (Kristin Scott Thomas) in the small town
of 'Bussy' looking after her husband 'Gaston's' interests, while he's away fighting, though news will filter through that
he's become a prisoner of war.
'Bussy' also becomes subject of German occupation when a unit roll into town, enforcing their strict ruling, the officers
get allocated accommodation, the lavish home 'Lucille' and her mother-in-law are not exempt, Officer 'Bruno Von Falk'
(Matthias Schoenaerts) is assigned a room and office in their home.
'Madame Agellier' is upper-class, stiff upper lip, and will only acknowledge her ''guest'' if spoken too, and insists 'Lucille'
does the same.
'Bruno' is a polite gentlemanly sole who loves music, before being in the army, a composer, however he is an officer of
the Third Reich.
'Lucille' and 'Bruno' become drawn to each other despite everything, however the realities of the occupation rears it's
ugly head when a German Officer is killed by a local farmer, 'Bruno' has to do what is needed, and issues a threat to
have executions take place if the culprit is not given up......
A well portrayed drama that shows many realities of German occupation during WW2.
Much attention to detail with the settings and fashion of the times.
Worth a viewing.
Some scenes of an adult nature, some nudity and some use of colourful language.

7063736,5,B00UNPX4XM,"This is a review of the film, not the DVD.

Suite Francaise (2014) is a war drama piece set in France in 1940.  The Nazi Germans have just invaded France and are marching towards Paris.  Outside of the capital city, in picturesque countryside, lies a little town where the main heroin Lucile (Michelle Williams) lives with her mother-in-law (Kristin Scott Thomas) who is a land-owner and lives off renting real-estate.  Lucile's husband is missing-in-action, and the two ladies try to manage on their own.  When the Germans soldiers arrive in their town, their life situation changes...a handsome German officer by the name of Bruno (Matthias Schoenaerts) is accommodated to their large villa.  Urged by her mother-in-law not to pay any attention to him, Lucile slowly gets drawn to him and his piano music...

There is an interesting statement spoken by one of the female characters at the beginning of the film, which I think perfectly highlights the film, namely: ""If you want to see what people are made of, start a war"".

This film will particularly appeal to the fans of The English Patient (1996).",1438041600,8,1104,4.92972972972973
7063757,4,B00UNPX4XM,"Bought this for my girlfriend, she wanted to get this one after she watch it on I think Netflix. I'm giving it four stars because it's a good story line, but I expected a little bi more to happen in it. My girlfriend probably would give it five stars though.",1503273600,,258,4.18

7063760,5,B00UNPX4XM,"In this time frame when so many young novelists are making their debuts with World War II as the scenario especially the French Resistance.  Dunkirk just opened to rave reviews.  I'll never understand that. This movie excels in direction, acting, scenery, and especially the haunting music that continues to stay with me.
I have to own it.",1501286400,3,339,4.9298245614035086

7063762,5,B00UNPX4XM,"Michelle Williams, Matthias Schoenaerts and Kristine Scott Thomas are superb, their performances are Oscar worthy. I thank the director of the movie - Saul Dibb for this beautiful work of art, Oscar worthy, big time! The attention to detail, the costumes, the locations - all amazing. Loved everything about it. Watched it several times since I got it two weeks ago.",1499212800,3,366,5.016393442622951
7063763,5,B00UNPX4XM,"Until the end, I hadn't realized it was based on a true story. Michelle Williams, whom I haven't seen much in recent years shines in this film. It begins with her character, a shy young woman whose husband has gone to war and living with her domineering self interested Mother-in-law, Kristin Scott Thomas. Opposed to the poverty and dismal situations most of the villagers are experiencing, Thomas and Williams live in relative comfort. As German soldiers invade France and the personal homes of village inhabitants, the soldier assigned to Williams' home, played by Matthias Schoenaerts, begins to suspect her involvement in helping one of her tenants whose husband was involved in a crime. Rounding off the story is the tension and chemistry building between herself and Schoenaerts, whose acting is stellar. I recommend this movie.",1498867200,,835,5.192592592592592

7063765,3,B00UNPX4XM,"Historical inaccuracies are bothersome.
A couple of references to losses in Normandy although this story takes place in 1942 and there were no significant battles---if any----in Normandy until D-Day June 6, 1944.
Besides, the author of the book from which the movie is adapted died in 1942 so she certainly didn't know about ""Normandy"".
Otherwise, a good movie with decent acting on all parts and not any melodrama which is always a good thing.",1497744000,3,444,5.013513513513513

7063791,3,B00UNPX4XM,"A title crawl at the end of the movie describes the background of the novel. The author, a Jew trapped in Nazi-occupied France, knew that she was doomed. She made the most of her time to write about the shattered world around her. She was arrested before she could complete Suite Franaise. The book we have is in two parts: one an ""on the road"" story of a mixed group of Parisians fleeing the German invasion in June of 1940, the other a tight psychological novel set in an occupied village two years later. Both are witty, unsentimental works of social criticism. Under the pressure of occupation, all the injustices and hypocrisies of French society are squeezed out into plain sight.
 The movie is not an adaptation of the novel Nmirovsky wrote, but of the one the movie-makers think she should have written. It's a standard World War II melodrama, in which even the ""Good"" German is forced to commit atrocities by the evil Nazi system he serves, while the French, whatever their flaws, learn to pull together and mount heroic resistance by the end.
 The movie is, basically, the second story in the book, about the occupied village. There's only one scene from the first story, in which desperate refugees stream into town and Kristin Scott Thomas, as the hard-hearted bourgeoise, is only worried that a couple of them might try to get into her car. Later on, there's another scene that's faithful to the original, in which a German officer is sickened by reading anonymous letters from French people denouncing each other. By the end though, the moviemakers have decided Nmirovksy is just too tough to take, and they discard her. Everybody pulls a gun and gets on with a standard war movie.
 It's watchable, thanks to a handsome production and good actors, but not the tribute to the author that in its last minutes it pretends to be.",1492128000,9,1839,4.722741433021807

7063821,5,B00UNPX4XM,"The movie was a solid love story between Michelle Williams and Matthias Schoenaerts and it was more then inetersting enough to watch for 2 hours.
The director was Saul Dibb who also made a fine work <THE DUCHESS> which I liked very much and I had a pretty high expectation before watching it.
He made it pretty delicately.
Michelle Williams was kind of flat charactor but Matthias Schoenaerts was amazingly fun to watch.
I saw him from other great movies like <RUST AND BONES><FAR FROM MADDING CROWD>.
He was born in Belgium so there was no problem speaking both in German and English.

The story is taking place during the German conqure France.
Matthias Schoenaerts is a German officer who stays in Michelle Williams' house forcefully with one more soldier.

First Michelle tries to ignore him but listening to strange rather unknown classic music he plays by piano, he begins to notice him.
He is a composer before the war and he was a delicate man.

Little by little even thought Michelle was married and her husband was at war not even know that he is alive, she falls in love with Matthias.
The love was a pure one.

That love didn't ignite into a big fire but was big enought to continue till the war was about to end.

When there was a man who was injured who killed one of the German soldier happens to be hidden by Michelle and when Matthias found out that, he even risks his life to save that man and Michelle.
Matthias at that time didn't even knew he will ever see her again. That was to nature of true love.

There was also Kristen Scott Thomas acted but she was much older then other movies and her roll was so small and one dimentional to be ignored.

The movie was all about Michelle and Matthias and the mood. The mood of the war and the setting that make them fall in love.
The moment Matthias makes music for Muchelle as a love song, the moment he hold her hands and indicates that he loves her.

This movie is not about showing directly that I LOVE YOU. It is more like from the inside in a more like an old fashioned way.
But it did worked well.
And when the movie ends with the music and the ending credit, we still sits watching it for awhile hope they will reappear and show us some more.

That's the beauty of this movie.",1463702400,5,2247,4.356459330143541

I think this is an interesting story, an unlikely (almost) romance.  Stars are wonderful.  Michelle Williams was awesome as usual (She should be winning oscars), Matthias Schoenarts is handsome and appealing even as a Nazi and Kristin Scott Thomas is classy as a highly strung landowner.",1454976000,6,424,4.794520547945205
7063823,4,B00UNPX4XM,"Well done. Worth the watch. A touching story. I would've liked a bit more dialogue.
