4860906,5,B005R2SI1E,"I have loved A Flinstone Christmas ever since I was a little girl. I used to love to watch Cartoon Networks Christmas party, but as I aged I was seeing less and less of the true classics and more and more junk! It is true that as of last year, Cartoon Network and Abc Family's count down to Christmas had shown it, I was still afraid that One year it would be gone. I was thrilled when I saw that Amozon had it for such an affordable price and it had two Christmas specials on it. It is a great Dvd, good quality, and a holiday  must every Christmas for our little family.",1348704000,29,572,4.061946902654867
4860907,5,B005R2SI1E,I love everything Christmas and the first Christmas movie is similar to the only Christmas episode they ever made but its still good. So is the other one. Merry Christmas.,1331683200,,171,4.733333333333333
4860908,5,B005R2SI1E,"Great DVD perfect for young children.  It is entertaining to kids and adults.  My 4.5 year old twins find many disney movies sad or scary, they absolutely LOVE the flinstones as it has neither quality!",1331596800,15,201,4.714285714285714
4860909,5,B005R2SI1E,I remember watching this on TV during the festive season when I was a kid and loved it. As soon as I knew it was on DVD I had to own a copy for my kids to enjoy too. A classic movie.,1328572800,,182,3.357142857142857

4860912,5,B005R2SI1E,One of those Great cartoons that you watch growing up and rarely see on television any longer.  So many Christmas shows and cartoons are rarely scene.  This is one classic cartoon that is a holiday must see.  Fred and the Flinstone family celebrate Christmas in Bedrock.. Fun for the family and reminder of old time christmas,1323648000,7,325,4.767857142857143
4860913,4,B005R2SI1E,"i bought this DVD for 4.99 and i was excited to get it. I grew up with this movie, so i was excited to learn i can get the DVD version for only 5 bucks. I received the right away but when i opened it up to watch it i saw something that concerned me. It looks like a burned CD, but come to my surprise it looks pretty decent. I would of given 5 stars, but the movie came in full screen and i have a wide screen TV which means it was cut off to only be in the center of the screen.

4860919,1,B005R2SI1E,"Similar to too many modernerzied cartoons, this Christmas special fails to stay true to old fashioned Flintstones, and is so boring, contrived, and humorless that we gave it away after barely being able to sit through the didactic tale of Fred helping a poor, troubled youth during Christmas.

4860924,3,B005R2SI1E,"This has two holiday specials: the 48 minute 1977 one, where Pebbles & Bam Bam are elementary age kids. The 2nd special is from 1993 and is 23 minutes long. Pebbles & Bam Bam make a brief appearance at the end as a married couple flying in from Hollywood Rock with their twins.

1977: Santa is ill so Fred & Barn deliver all the world's presents and barely make it to the kids in Bedrock at Mr. State's party.

1993: Fred & Barney are robbed by a juvenile whom they decide to take in and show him the joys of Christmas.

The prints of these both are not that good. Rather hazy transfers. There are no special features.",1513036800,3,618,4.220338983050848

There's nothing on the copy (scratches, smudges, etc.) And there's nothing wrong with my player. I have to skip past the whole first part of the movie and then it just continues to skip. Quality control, indeed.",1419206400,2,388,3.9871794871794872
4860975,5,B005R2SI1E,"The Flintstones had 4 Christmas specials (as the Jetsons only had 1), and in 2007, A Flintstones Christmas Carol finally came to DVD, with A Christmas Flintstone as a bonus program. It wouldn't be until 2011 that their other 2 Christmas specials would be on DVD with this collection from the Warner Archive. A Flintstone Christmas from 1977 is an hour-long special, that takes place when Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are little kids, and Fred and Barney fill in for Santa after he sprains his ankle (and catches cold) from falling off Fred's roof. It contains three of H-B's Christmas songs reused and reworked from A Christmas Story (1971)! This disc's 2nd special was one me and my family weren't aware of until 2008; the Emmy-nominated 1993 special, A Flintstone Family Christmas, takes place after HollyRock-a-Bye Baby when Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm got hitched and had twins named Chip and Roxy, and it's about Fred and Wilma taking in an orphaned juvenile delinquent named Stoney (who sounds just like Chuckie Finster from Rugrats AND Gosalyn Waddlemeyer/Mallard from Darkwing Duck, via Christine Cavanaugh voicing Stoney), and showing him how Christmas works for them and the Rubbles. Though another Rugrats actress Kath Soucie voiced Pebbles in HollyRock-a-Bye Baby, someone else did here, but she did voice the Christmas lights Eel. This would be a Christmas the Flintstones and Rubbles would never forget! If you can't stand the bad things being said about Stoney, I've heard much worse coming from TV in general today, on top of my being bullied/mistreated during my only semester at Asheville High School in 2002, and I was only an innocent victim; so this special's a lot better to my whole family by comparison, as to other families who appreciate this lesser-known classic worldwide. So go ahead and add these last 2 Christmases with the Flintstones to your Christmas classics home video collection today, unless you've already done so! The Jetson's only Christmas special, A Jetson Christmas Carol, can only be found in their Season 2 Volume 2 set here, unless you wanna settle for YouTube just for that 1 special! No way I'd pay over $35 just for that 1 special, unless I plan to see that set's other 19 episodes, too! YABBA DABBA DOO!",1418774400,2,2241,4.962765957446808

4860978,5,B005R2SI1E,"I loved the Flintstones when I was a kid. This is a DVD you have to have if you loved the Christmas specials. I agree with other reviews when they say the DVD looks like a pirated DVD. The cover on the disc doesn't look flashy and the menu isn't that inspiring either. I wish they would have touched up the video a bit.

I wish I had bought this movie together with the other Flintstone Christmas DVD to save on shipping. I forgot there was another movie.

This has nothing to do with the DVD but I don't understand why shipping costs so much when the DVD shipped from Brampton (or Burlington; I can't remember which city).",1417996800,4,623,4.271186440677966

4860981,4,B005R2SI1E,"As a kid, I always loved ""A Flintstone Christmas"" (1977) and I was excited to find it on DVD at a great price so I can watch it again after so many years and share it with my daughter. There are two movies on this: ""A Flintstone Christmas"" which is why I bought it and ""A Flintstone Family Christmas"" (1993).

In ""A Flintstone Christmas"" Fred is asked by Wilma to play Santa for the kids at her Women's Auxiliary party and in his grumpy way he says no until his boss Mr. Slate asks him to play Santa. Fred and Barney run into the real Santa, who Fred thinks is an imposter at first; Santa fell off the Flintstone's roof and sprained his ankle and now can't deliver presents so with his Christmas magic, he transforms Fred into Santa and Barney into an elf and they set off around the world to deliver presents. Fred starts off grumpy about the holidays but learns the joy of Christmas and the happiness one gets in bringing joy to others. Unfortunately, helping Santa makes him late for the Christmas party and Mr. Slate and the children are in a tizzy until Fred shows up, with no presents since he'd delivered them all. He uses Christmas magic to get presents for the children and everyone is happy. I love this movie!

The second movie ""A Flintstone Family Christmas"" is TERRIBLE and is why I'm giving this 4 stars!  I remember watching it as a kid the year it came out but I'd forgotten the plot of it. After watching it once with my daughter on this DVD, I'll never watch that one again! In this one, Fred is excited that Christmas is coming and so are Pebbles, Bam Bam, and their kids. While out with Barney, he gets mugged by an orphan kid named Stoney and picks him out of a line up at the police station, saying some pretty mean things about him in the process. Wilma takes him home with them because she feels sorry for him and he proceeds to get in trouble by stealing, so Fred refers to him as ""defective!"" Another unsavory moment is when Stoney hooks up illegal cable and when he does, some seductive looking cartoon women come on screen - not exactly family appropriate. When he watches a movie with Fred, the movie character, referring to Stoney says ""I don't want to think about people like you at Christmas time!"" Such dark undertones in this movie and really rude remarks that aren't festive or family friendly. By the end, Stoney is accepted by the family and changes his ways, but this movie is terrible and not worth the 24 minutes it runs. My daughter was afraid of all the yelling in the movie. Skip this one and stick with the first movie ""A Flintstone Christmas.""",1417478400,4,2588,4.39874739039666
