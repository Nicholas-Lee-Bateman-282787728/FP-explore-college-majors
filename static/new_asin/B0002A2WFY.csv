2073307,5,B0002A2WFY,"This hasn't come out yet and people are starting to make all sorts of negative comments. Maybe the Colorization looks good. You'll never know until you actually buy it and watch it. Until then, refrain from the negative comments. Columbia is working very hard on these shorts in order to give the shorts good restoration and good color. Watch it before making any sort of negative comments. And, let me remind you. EACH DVD HAS THE BLACK AND WHITE ORIGINALS ON IT!! So, stop complaining. If you hate the colorized version, don't watch it. Watch the black and white version. That's why Columbia provided both. If it costs too much, well too bad. Don't buy it, simple as that.",1089072000,3,674,4.6722689075630255

I can't wait to see an ache in the stake but Columbia has apparently cut it to only 4 episodes hence the 3 stars I will buy it thou because of the shorts in it. I like the fact that you will be able to toggle between color and black and white but I'd like to see more shorts.,1087689600,,328,3.7681159420289854

2073334,5,B0002A2WFY,I always loved the Stooges' shorts in black & white but now I love them better in color. The best part is that you can choose which version you want to watch the short in. I have NEVER in my life seen one Stooge short in color. It makes the Stooges look like they're in a movie. I hope one day that they release ALL their shorts in color.,1419811200,,338,3.9130434782608696

2073359,5,B0002A2WFY,"To see the stooges in color brought to it a whole different dimension to it that was missed when I saw them as a kid on TV reruns after school. I know some people object to the colorization of old black & white movies, but if that bothers you then watch the originals

2073371,5,B0002A2WFY,"I love the Stooges, always have ever since childhood. I got this DVD for the Punch Drunks episode, when Curly went bananas whenever he heard Pop Goes the Weasel. He's in a prize fight and Larry has to play the violin for him, playing that song, of course. These episodes have also been colorized, so you can choose which one to watch. Included are Men In Black (1934), The Sitter Downers (1937), Punch Drunks (1934), and Playing The Ponies (1937). The episodes are also restored and look great.

2073374,5,B0002A2WFY,"Their style of humor was copied so much by Bugs Bunny and Road Runner cartoons that colorizing the Stooges just seems right. There's nothing cinematically dramatic about these films. They're just going for laughs and seeing the colors that they were actually working with as they made these comedies is great. Except for skin tones which don't look quite natural, the colors are very realistic. So who cares if the've been in b&w for 70 years. The world is in color and now so are the Howard Bros. and Fine.",1308182400,,507,4.644444444444445
2073375,3,B0002A2WFY,"When you think about it, they could have easily put 12 or more color shorts on this one disc simply by using a dual layered disc, since most fans already have these in black & white, what's the sense in putting both versions on same disc?
I prefer the stooges in black and white (nostalgic thing) but it's a nice curiosity to see them in color.",1304899200,,344,4.2272727272727275

Yes, I know that Moe was supposedly the leader of the madcap merrymen, but in my opinion, Curly was the star that made the entire schtick work so well.

The colorization is wonderful, and if you wish to see the original black and white, it has been masterfully restored.  I recommend this DVD along with the other three stooges colorized DVD's as an excellent investment in humor from a long time ago, which nevertheless still holds up to this day.",1252713600,,597,4.5514018691588785

The transfer quality is excellent, and the colorization is as well.  It's a blast to watch some of these old episodes in color, as new life is breathed into them.  You can also toggle between the B&W and color versions with the angle button on your remote.

Now that Columbia is releasing these shorts the way they should be, these DVD presentations are obsolete and I can get rid of them.  I've never watched the colorized shorts and never will.  Colorization is an insult to the creators of a film.  This would of been a 5 rating if not for the inclusion of the colorized versions.  Also, there is a small superimposed object in the upper right corner that looks something like a camera.  I have to hit my display button to remove it.  I've got no idea what it represents.  It appears at the beginning of each episode.",1223078400,,633,4.396551724137931
2073391,1,B0002A2WFY,"I bought this DVD for my dad as a Christmas gift but unfortunately it isn't playing correctly.  It skips back and forth between color and B&W mode in the middle of play and it stops abruptly at odd times.

I hope the replacement copy will play correctly!",1198800000,,254,4.382978723404255
2073392,4,B0002A2WFY,"While most reviewers here choose to trash this release without viewing it.  Typical Stooge Snobbery.
What this DVD offers is an uncut version of Disorder In The Court with footage not in the public domain version albiet a very short addition. The colorization is top notch,and not what many objected to when B&W films first got colorized. Same for the other 3 shorts.
I have said it before and here I go again. If you want to keep the boys around in the minds of younger viewers the films need to be in color. The Disc allows you to watch in B&W too so.
For those who hate seeing this technology relax and watch the shorts in great condition uncut in B&W. Well worth the small $$ they charge for it,and cheaper used!
Don't be hatin, pick it up and be lovin it instead.

The 3 Stooges still make me laugh and I love seeing the films in color. If you are begining your collection I reccomend this one and the other Columbia DVD colorized DVDs.",1195948800,2,941,4.340909090909091
2073393,4,B0002A2WFY,"I have loved the stooges since I was a kid, and these color versions are not perfect but they give you a glimpse of what it would have been like if you were there on the set when they were filmed .......since they have been researched as to what colors the different backgrounds and objects would really look like.... I do enjoy seeing them in color anyday over black and white.  For the purist at heart the colorization can be toggled on or off with the angle button on my dvd player, couldn't be simpler. The restoration of the film is very good, and the color brings new life to the stooges glorious mayhem. I own quite of few of the Columbia shorts in black and white and I will continue to buy the color versions as long as they are released......I just hope they speed up the process a little faster.

Curly was my favorite stooge and he was in about 90 shorts from 1933 to 1947 and if they continue to release only his material with only four shorts per disc that would take about 22.5 years for Columbia to release if  they release only one color dvd per year, I might be dead by then......that seems to be their average for the color dvd's......please speed up the process.....and one other thing, Columbia please put more of the unreleased stuff in color not the already released material. A loyal fan of the stooges.....

P.S.  I would have given 5 stars if they put five episodes on one disc instead of four......",1180396800,,1425,4.403041825095057
2073394,1,B0002A2WFY,"I love the old Stooges shorts. At less then twenty mintues, some of them have more laughs in then some full-length comedies today. I just wish the studio would continue restoring these shorts as well as they can in B&W and stop wasting their time colorizing them. Colorization is changing an artistic piece of work. I rented this DVD off of Netflix because I just wanted to see the shorts in black and white. They were in great condition. Please release a big collection of all the Stooges shorts with remastered sound and picture quality. I would buy it and I know hundreds of Stooges fans would, too. Just don't COLORIZE the shorts!",1179878400,,634,4.619469026548672
2073395,5,B0002A2WFY,"I really don't know what the problem is with some of these negative reviews relating to this , or any of the STOOGES COLOR combo B&W DVD's! The colorization is very well done, and you're still getting the b&w to boot! THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS! So way complain!? Don't get me wrong, i would rather have an awesome b&w copy over colorization any day of the week. But like i said, this dvd series offers both. I really hope this collection continues. The colorization (well done),gives watching these old classics a fresh, and fun look in a whole new light. I think its refreshing to see the stooges B&W prints that i've seen for many years,over and over again done in a new color prespective.  I do hope that the complete B&W collection (BOX SET), is indeed released in the very near futher. (With no PUNCH DRUCK BIG BLACK SCRATCHED COPYS)!!! What a crappy print...! Please release clean remastered copy's PLEASE! Anyways..this is a well worth , well done double deal,..!! 4 COLOR /4 B&W for one price!",1175644800,4,999,4.581005586592179
2073396,5,B0002A2WFY,"The colour in these shorts is brilliant - it looks authentic for the era and highlights so much more detail in the scenes. One can now empathise with the action rather than view it simply as a relic of the dim past. The Stooges come alive as flesh and blood people, young and vital again! Let's hope the studio produces many more of these remastered and coloured shorts.",1175472000,4,370,4.455882352941177

I HOPE COLUMBIA KEEPS PUTTING OUT MORE OF THIS COLLECTION. I JUST WISH THEY WOULD COME OUT WITH NEW STOOGES SHORTS, NOT THE SAME OL' SAME OL', YA KNOW? ANYWAYS,..THIS IS AN AWESOME DVD SERIES. JUST KEEP THEM BOTH COLOR AND B&W.SOME THINGS I WOULD RATHER HAVE LEFT IN B&W , (EXAMPLE ):OLD POPEYE CARTOONS!!! DON;T COLORIZE THEM MAN!!

2073398,5,B0002A2WFY,"Yes!!! Finally, Columbia has released more Colorized shorts from the vault. I have waited for these for a long time.

Yes, there are repeatedly released shorts on here, including Disorder In The Court, but the previously released colorized versions of that short (as it has been colorized twice before from two other companies) use a much more inferior print of the film to work with, while Columbia's print is pristine and looks wonderful.

Yes, I do agree that Columbia needs to put out more shorts that have not made it to dvd, and that 4 per dvd on these sets is not enough. However, I am happy with the quality, I love the fact that with the colorized versions, I am able to see details that i never previously picked out while watching the black and white versions, and I am happy that these are restored sound and picture quality, allowing me to even hear some things that I've never picked up on before. Hopefully with the next dvds, Columbia will issue some shorts that are not available yet on dvd at all.

This dvd was a long time coming as it is, and I hope the next batch does not take as long.",1171929600,,1107,4.416666666666667
2073399,5,B0002A2WFY,"Screw the nitpickers! So what if there's only four episodes, it cost bucks to do colorization as good as this. And so far this is the best I've seen, and I have seen a lot. If you are into the Stooges you are gonna love the colorization and it has the option to be seen in B/W.

2073400,5,B0002A2WFY,"'The Three Stooges- Stooged and Confused', is without a doubt the best example of colorization I've seen, and couldn't have looked better had it been filmed in color to begin with! I can't understand those who criticise these discs, after all, you also get the original black & white prints, so how can you go wrong? O.K. as with all such discs, some shorts may be better than others, but that's just a matter of which ones are your favorites, but as far as the color goes, it's very realistic, and it's a great way to see the 'Stooges' as close as possible to how they would have been seen if color was the norm back in those days. I personally hope they do it to all of them.

That is why all you huffalumps should quit complaining about the amazing colorization technology used here, unless you want the Stooges to become a relic. It's obvious to me that trying to appeal to a new, young audience is the main reason for offering both versions on one disc. To a 12-year-old who has never seen it in black & white, they would never know the difference, but being in color it would at least hold their interest.

So I was elated to see a new collection out there.  But it isn't new, it's stuff already released (in better quality) with the option to watch them colorized.  What a Drag.  If you don't have any stooges, not a bad buy, but the Boxed set is better, and has all this rehash in the package.

2073414,5,B0002A2WFY,"It's amazing how new the Three Stooges look in color and how many things you notice that you've never seen before.  I discovered the Stooges in 1958 when Columbia sold the shorts to TV and my granddad sat me on his knee to watch them.  Been a fan ever since.  Therefore I have seen most of the Columbia shorts scores of times.

However, the colorization process has really added a new dimension to these shorts.  The Stooges, supporting players, and yes even the backgrounds jump off the screen.  You're no longer watching a dated movie but one that could have been made just this year.  Yes some things are dated, and the quality of the surviving prints are not HD, but are things out of the control of Columbia and Sony.

I even noticed one major correction to the original that I applaud.  For some reason in Disorder in the Court, most prints have Bud Jamison appear as if he is wearing the pasty white pancake makeup associated with silent movie actors.  But the colorization of Bud is exact, natural, and very welcomed.

Colorizing always is subjective and there are a couple of quibbles I could make about the choice of colors.  There seems to be too much of a reliance on green.  The walls of the hospital, the walls of the courtroom, the scrubs worn by the Stooges, even some cars during an era when more than 90% of all cars were black, are tinted green.  It seems like the powers that be tried to avoid black and white whenever possible.  However when compared to the overall product, this is an extremely minor gripe and does not affect my star rating.

It's a shame that Amazon allows people to post reviews for a product if the reviewer has never seen the product.  Many negative reviews written previous to this one display fear from ""fans"" as they critize the colorization process.  It's easy to detect these reviews as they never mention anything specific to the product but use phrases like ""garbage"" or ""don't waste your money"".  There are even reviews that were written BEFORE THE ITEM WAS RELEASED.  Don't be fooled by the fear of these ""reviewers"".  Read the reviews of people who have actually seen the product and know of what they speak.

I'm looking forward to more colorized releases from Columbia / Sony.  The new ChromaColor process is the best colorizing process I have seen and the Stooges are a great place to use it.  Hopefully this will interest more people in discovering this timeless, classic trio.",1165881600,2,2435,4.6223776223776225

Why else would they slap us in the face with previously released material rather than getting new shorts out on the market? Hollywood's new trick is to make the public re-purchase the same product over and over again. When a DVD comes out, just wait and there will be a special edition for you to buy around the corner (Lord of the Rings, Hellboy, Daredevil etc . . . ).  This tactic is now evident with the Stooges properties.  I love The Three Stooges (all six of them) but this is just insulting.  Will I purchase this new disc? No.  Clustering around the same films time and time again is like a poke in the eye.

However, in this case I'm going to make an exception, seeing as all 4 of these shorts have already been released.  There are no surprises here.  This will be like the 13th time that 'Disorder in the Court' has been released, and there's already been a colorised version to boot!  Yeah, it's a great short and an undisputed classic, but due to how it's one of the 4 public domain shorts, it's been released over and over again.  Sometimes overexposure can make even great things seem boring.  Seriously, why did the powers that be think the world needed yet ANOTHER release of 'Disorder in the Court'?

The other three shorts have also been released on various other discs.  'Dizzy Doctors' is already on a disc of the same name, 'Pop Goes the Easel' is on 'Stooges and the Law,' and 'Calling All Curs' is on 'Cops and Robbers.'  They're all great shorts, but why, if they insisted on continuing to do this colorised nonsense, couldn't they at least have chosen some titles that haven't been issued on DVD yet, like, say, 'They Stooge to Conga,' 'I'll Never Heil Again,' 'Uncivil Warriors,' or 'So Long, Mr. Chumps'?  And why in the name of all that's holy are they only putting 4 shorts on each disc now?  The previous two colorised DVDs sold predictably poorly, and now they're doing it all over again, setting themselves up for the exact same situation where a DVD will sell badly and the executives will conclude that that means there's no widespread public interest in this material?  Who is actually going to buy this disc when all 4 titles are already all available on other DVDs?  At least the other colorised discs didn't consist of ALL repeats.

The latest word on the street is that Sony has confirmed the rumor that, sometime in 2007, they're going to start issuing all 190 shorts in boxed sets, properly, with no colorisation.  Supposedly this disaster of a release is just to tide the fans over until the real goods hit the market.  This is a pointless and self-defeating marketing move if I ever heard of one.  How is one supposed to feel tided over while waiting on proper boxed sets with the likes of this?  A disc meant to tide the fans over would consist of shorts not already available on DVD, and any way one slices it, all of the previous DVDs will be rendered pretty much useless and obsolete anyway when the boxed sets start coming out.  I'd recommend waiting until next year instead of spending money on this.",1156636800,52,2619,4.654347826086957
2073434,3,B0002A2WFY,"Who are the executives at Columbia who seriously thought that this would be a good idea?  Fans of classic film sent the powers that be a message in the Eighties that they hated colorisation, and after the issue was seemingly dead and buried, it rears its ugly head again in a new generation.  The Chroma Color (from what I saw of it on the self-congratulatory featurette) does look better than the colorisation of the Eighties, but that's still not saying very much.  It might look better and more realistic, but it still looks fake and distracting.  And even if it did look totally natural and lifelike, it just doesn't feel right.  Some people you can only ever picture in black and white; to imagine the Stooges in color (apart from a handful of films they made that were actually originally shot in Technicolor) would just seem wrong.  These shorts were shot in black and white and have been enjoyed in black and white for over 70 years now.  The technicians can do all of the research they want on what types of colors these things might have been, but it's still missing a big point--the colors that were actually chosen were chosen precisely because of how they would register on black and white film stock.  The colors used certainly wouldn't have looked anything like what they actually do in Chroma Color.  Frankly, the only reason I even rented this disc was because I hadn't yet seen 'Playing the Ponies' or 'The Sitter-Downers.'

This disc also has the misfortune of only having two previously unreleased shorts.  It's great that one at least has the option of viewing them in B&W or color (and there is a ""Play All"" button, something that was absent on almost all of the previous discs), but it's not great at all that the consumer is basically being asked to pay much more money for something that only has two new-to-DVD shorts.  'Men in Black' and 'Punch Drunks' were already released on the 'Curly Classics' disc.  Including both the B&W and colorised versions, there are 8 shorts on this disc; if only they could have been 8 shorts that hadn't been released on DVD prior instead of consisting of two rehashes.  And come on, only 4 shorts on a disc, regardless of how many had already been released?

The shorts themselves are somewhat of a mixed bag.  'Punch Drunks' (1934), their second Columbia short and the only one they got credit for writing themselves, is a classic, even though they hadn't really ironed out their comedy style, their screen personae, or their screen relationship yet.  If only this and not 'Woman Haters' had been their first short, since it has the three of them meeting one another for the first time in the opening scenes and starts to establish their characters and relationship.

'Men in Black' (1934) I personally find to be kind of overrated.  It is rather memorable, but more because of what an odd short it is, not because it's fall-down hilarious or contains a lot of classic lines and routines.  It seems like a lot of their early shorts have been declared classics only because they were done so early in their tenure at Columbia, and not for any more substantial reasons.  Seriously, would this short be considered such a great classic had it been made in, say, 1940 or 1938?  Still, as strange as this short may be, at least it's nowhere near the likes of 'Horsing Around' or 'Rumpus in a Harem.'

'Playing the Ponies' (1937) has some fun stuff in it, but overall I didn't find it to be so hot.  This short got a one-star rating in 'The Three Stooges Scrapbook,' though I wouldn't give it such a poor rating myself.  (This is also the same book that gives 3-star ratings to the likes of 'Sweet and Hot,' 'Hoofs and Goofs,' and 'Fling in the Ring'!)  This is a cute fun short, but overall it's not one of their classics.  I'd consider it a bit below average.

'The Sitter-Downers' (1937), which stars Ted Healy's sister Marcia as Cora Belle, could perhaps be viewed as the short in which they entered into their golden era.  There's a lot of great stuff in this one, and even though the premise of trying to build a house had been done before (by Buster Keaton in 'One Week' and by Laurel and Hardy in 'The Finishing Touch'), it doesn't seem like an old and tired situation.  The possibilities for comedic mayhem are endless when carpentry is involved!  The concept of sit-down strikes was also something that would have hit the original audience very close to home, as they were all over the news that year.  The ending is somewhat abrupt, but everything that went before was so great that it doesn't really matter.

This is not a collection I would recommend getting, even considering that one does have the option of watching them in B&W only.  Though the overall quality of the shorts is pretty decent, there are still only 4 shorts, and half of them have been issued before.  It's ridiculous that someone actually thought this would sell well and generate a lot of interest instead of indifference and anger.",1156377600,,4970,4.6282782212086655
2073435,3,B0002A2WFY,"Leaving aside the issue of colorisation for a moment, it is great to see the classics 'You Nazty Spy!' and 'An Ache in Every Stake' finally on DVD.  It's also great to see the second-tier classic 'No Census, No Feeling' also represented here.  However, the joy over that is quickly put into perspective by the fact that there are only 4 shorts on this disc (with one of them a repeat) and that there are colorised versions also available.  Although at least the B&W originals are also available (and are in beautifully restored prints), together with a ""Play All"" button, a feature that was nonexistent on all but a handful of the previous discs in this series.  The shorts themselves:

'Violent Is the Word for Curly' (1938) is a classic, though I do understand why some people feel it's a bit overrated.  It does sort of have the feel of being more like a series of loosely connected sketches than one smoothly flowing whole.  However, all of the individual scenes themselves are great, and it's generally felt that this was the best of the shorts the great Charley Chase directed for the boys.  Although as great as this short is, it makes no sense for it to have been selected for inclusion here, seeing as it was already on 'All the World's a Stooge.'

'No Census, No Feeling' (1940) might not perhaps be one of their topmost classics, but it is very strong and funny regardless, perhaps one of their second-tier classics.  There's not a dull or wasted scene or moment, with everything flowing so perfectly from start to finish.  It's also a joy to see (and hear!) the wonderful oft-forgotten silent comedian Max Davidson in a bit role, as the shopkeeper.  However, there are some dated jokes and references in this one; I don't think that most people under a certain age, unless they're already very into the Golden Age of Hollywood and classic films, with more than just a casual passing interest, will know who Will Hays was (the head of the Production Code and an infamous censor), and there's also a joke about the changing date of Thanksgiving (in 1939 its observance was set for Thursdays).

'You Nazty Spy!' (1940) is an absolute bona-fide classic, without a doubt one of the best they ever did.  Even though 'The Great Dictator' was already in production when this was made, it was released before Chaplin's masterpiece, a fact that a lot of people don't seem to be aware of.  This was the first Hollywood film to spoof and ridicule the Nazis, and seeing as the three stars of the short, in addition to the director, were all Jewish, this was personal.  It took a lot of guts to make such a film when America was still in the grip of isolationism and didn't really fully look upon Hitler as a full-out enemy or threat just yet.  It's a brilliant satire and also absolutely hilarious, a dead-on spoof of not just the Nazis but all fascists and dictators in general.  I also love how much Yiddish was used during this film (most people probably thought it was just gibberish or pretend German, not some rather funny and witty wordplay in a real language).

'An Ache in Every Stake' (1941) is also routinely held up as one of their most classic.  This one also flows perfectly from start to finish, not a dull or wasted moment, with too many great scenes and moments to count (such as the shaving of the ice, the attempted delivery of the ice up that massive flight of stairs, and Vernon Dent's misadventures with the birthday cake).  It seems like a lot of fans have this one in their personal Top 10 lists.  However, it is a little lame how some of the ""ice blocks"" in the wagon are so obviously solid boxes (which have somehow magickally transformed themselves into actual ice by the time they reach the top of the stairs).  That's just as lazy as the numerous times when the faces of stunt doubles were clearly exposed!

Overall, the material is great, but the execution isn't.  It makes no sense for one of the shorts to be a repeat (if they were going to repeat anything, it should have been the full-length 'Three Little Beers'), and for there to be only 4 shorts.  That's asking the consumer to pay much more for much less.  And the colorisation may look more realistic than the stuff that was done in the Eighties, but that's still not saying much.  The self-congratulatory featurette misses the point.  Doing all of the research in the world into what colors might have been used still doesn't change the fact that seeing a B&W classic with Chroma Color dubbed in looks fake and artificial, and even wrong.  There are just some people you can only ever imagine in B&W, who exist in B&W for all time, and to just imagine them in color seems wrong.  These colorised discs sold predictably poorly not because people weren't interested in the material, but because they knew what a rip-off it was, and didn't want colorisation.  (I had no problems with any toggle icon; it seems as though that's an issue with specific DVD players or the control menu, not something that automatically appears on every screen and won't go away.)  Overall, this is great material that deserved so much better.  It's not right that the two classics on this disc should FINALLY make their DVD debut, only to be rammed onto a misfire like this.",1156204800,2,5240,4.598924731182795

2073439,5,B0002A2WFY,"Regardless of the questionable quality as well as quantity of what's on here, I really wanted to praise this DVD for it's inclusion of the brilliantly done short called ""You Nazty Spy"" which does a spine-splittingly hilarious job of spoofing Nazi Germany during the end of the 1930s and early 1940s. In fact, it was the first of any kind of film that actually spoofed Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Here Moe Howard plays a fascist bumbling dictator named Moe Hailstone who is installed after the country of Moronica's kind is deposed and sent into exile. Moe's imitation of Hitler's speeches is scary at times but the way he barks in his version of German is so funny you may end up shedding tears from laughing so hard.

 While nowhere near ""You Nazty Spy"", the other three shorts included are also entertaining but ""An ache in Every Stake"" is my second favorite. Moe Larry and Curly star as icemen who deliver ice to customers during a severe heatwave but during that time destroy two birthday cakes that were meant for a police chief's birthday party. As they escaped from losing their icebox which actually crashes into the chief at the bottom of the stairs, the boys wind up as cooks after the original chef quits. The chef actually was assigned to make the birthday for the police chief who when he meets the new cooks is unaware that it's the same guys who ruined two of his previous birthday cakes.

 While I'll give credit for the colorizing job on the DVD, I'll always prefer the black & white version because it always feels more true to the spirit of the Three Stooges. There are certianly better buys out there than this one but the inclusion of ""You Nazty Spy"" and ""Ache In Every Stake"" make this DVD a five star for me.",1141344000,9,1731,4.538461538461538
2073440,1,B0002A2WFY,"The Stooges are great, but the core of their achievement -- the approximately two hundred comedy shorts they did for Columbia -- has never gotten anything remotely approaching the respect it or its fans deserve. This latest piece of junk adds yet more insult to injury.

A one-sided DVD will hold at least thirteen Stooges shorts, but Columbia, when it sporadically decides to knock out a new one, only includes five to eight shorts. Until now, that is.

This latest disgrace only has four shorts. You read that right -- less than a third of what it could hold, out of some 200 shorts in the Columbia vaults. And at least one of the four -- ""Men in Black"" -- is already out on an earlier-released Stooges DVD collection (*Curly Classics*).

The nyuk-nyuks are on us consumers, apparently.

Naturally, given Columbia's bent, it's charging more than ever. Pay more for less value, in other words. That should be Columbia's motto.

Oh, that's right: These are colorized. Like the Stooges really need that.

New and improved colorization, supposedly. There's even a little ""featurette"" trying to sell us on the colorization (when what consumers really want are a lot more Stooges shorts released, with far more shorts per disc and more reasonable prices). Colorization, we're assured, has made great technical strides since the old controversy about it in the '80s.

Let *me* assure you: *This* colorization job looks as bad as ever. Nothing looks real, and everybody's skin has that ghastly orangey washed-over look.

Fortunately, the colorization effect can be turned off. But not the distracting icon that's on the lower right corner of every frame of the Stooges shorts. Presumably this is to discourage piracy: But, if so, how do thousands of new movie and television DVDs get released without them? Why are Stooges fans singled out to suffer them?

The bottom line is that this is yet another example of Columbia's gross disrespect for both its products and its customers.

I'd gladly pay hundreds of dollars for thoughtfully released DVDs of the complete Stooges Columbia shorts: circa 13 shorts to a disc, lost scenes restored (another notorious failure so far by Columbia), no repetitions of shorts from disc to disc (the greed of these cheaters is illimitable), and, hopefully, some meaningful chronological order (by release dates or, better still, production sequence).

Not that I'm holding my breath.

For now, I'm just renting these Stooges DVDs on a one-time-only basis for myself and my children. I wouldn't dream of buying any of them given Columbia's greedy and insulting marketing schemes. Columbia won't get my money, and I hope it doesn't get yours.

2073444,5,B0002A2WFY,"I may be a numbskull, but I love these collections!!! I notice some people really don't like the idea of color for the stooges.  But being a true fan of stooge-mania, there is really a lot to like. These 4 amazing shorts look spectacular and I've never seen any stooges short look better, either on DVD or the old VHS tapes that I own. The picture is crisp and there is little if any distortions between the four twenty minute shorts. Even more amazing, all have also been colorized with the power of computer technology and it looks quite amazing, was this filmed in 05?? Wow! The 4 shorts, all from the 30's druing the prime time of the stooges era (All Curly), are of unmatched quality.  Columbia painstakingly removed the scratches and blemishes that have progressed throughout the years and they got a hold of the original prints and touched them up to boot.

The color factor of the collection is the main selling point, and although Columbia got a bit lazy as 4 shorts may seems pretty skimpy (about 60 minutes),but seeing them in color and the remastered original prints look is worth your hard earned dough. Some feel the color seems fake or washed out, but I personally love the color addition. It really makes you feel like the short was filmed in color.  It doesn't look too synthetic or fake, the realistic color with skin tones, color backdrops and every thread of clothing is a site to behold. Some shorts look better than others, the indoor scenes seem to suffer the most, but when they're outside, it seems to look more natural. When you view the shorts, take a close look at the trees, it's amazing how a computer can bring the color to life. At times I thought the skin tones of the stooges was a bit off at parts, they sometimes have a sunkist orangy tint, but considering the age of these shorts, what is not to like? Don't want to bother with the color? No problem. With the press of the ""angle"" button on your remote, you can instantly go back to the remastered black and white originals.

The shorts are all during the prime years of the stooges when they are all at their best. Playing the Ponies was never released on DVD before and was a nice inclusion. Curly has more time on the short and is well deserved for sure. Men in Black, one of their first shorts which was nominated for an Oscar, is one of Curly's best performances. The Sitter Downers contains enough slapping and bashing of Larry and Curly to do most stooges fans in, Moe really lays into them and the smacking and eye-poking and is as funny as ever. Pop Goes The Weasel, a bit of a take off of the other future (boxing/wrestling) short called Grips, Grunts and Groans (1937), is a short that was never released on VHS and a rare find for stooge fans. One mentioned the fact that this short was censored or edited out, I 100% guarantee it is uncut and very uncouth, you won't be disappointed. The ending sequence he was referring to that was left out was regarding ""Grips Grunts and Groans"" which was released later in the 30's.

I seriously like what Columbia is doing. They want to give us the best possible Stooge collection and this is a good start. The shorts really are remastered and being a fan of the stooges for 20 years, I can honestly say I've never seen a single short look better than these four. One can say Columbia is just out for a  quick buck to re-release the shorts and claim they look better, but believe me when I say, they seriously do look better. The colorized versions are very well done and they were painstakingly conceived by some real savvy people and computers. I hope the two DVD's offered are not the last, as I would love to have every stooge short ever made (remastered) and in color on DVD. If it takes years to have this accomoplished, I would be willing to wait. Well worth your dough if you're a fan especially if you want the absolute best. Moe, Larry and Curly would be proud.",1113868800,11,3909,4.443514644351464

But, even if you disagree with my opinion, that does not mean that my review in not helpful, even if it leads you NOT to purchase this product!  We can agree to disagree.

And...as far as profit motive is concerned...Have you ever heard of anyone involved in a commercial enterprise producing an item NOT to sell?  Here, at least an earnest effort was exerted to create something that is, at the very least, technologically stunning.  So, I ask you to be fair and open-minded, even if you are a purist.  And yes, they could have included more episodes per disc.  But, then again, the price is not exactly exorbitant.  And...the cost to produce these episodes in color, I suspect, was significant.

So, in MY opinion...
MAJOR KUDOS are in order for the producers and technicians of this series.  Painstaking effort was obviously applied to get results that are extremely natural-looking, and to treat both the product and legacy with love and respect.  The ""new"" color is quite exciting, especially for a big Stooges fan who has viewed these episodes dozens of times.  The results are so good that, indeed, it appears as if these eposodes were originally filmed in color.

In this collection, 3 very, very good episodes and 1 so-so one are featured.  All of these shorts feature Moe, Larry and Curly in their youthful, energetic prime.

""An Ache In Every Stake,"" is definitely one of the best Stooge shorts.  In it, the guys play ice delivery workers turned makeshift cooks at a birthday party.  Some of the all-time best gags are included.  I love Curly's ""conversation"" with the block of ice he is charged with ""shaving.""  And his turkey-stuffing routine is too classic.

In ""Violent Is The Word...,"" we have another case of mistaken identity, where the guys try to make the most of their ""good fortune.""  In this case, they are gas station workers (providing ""Super Service"") who end up as ""professors"" at an all-girls college.  There is merry music making as the Stooges do ""Swinging The Alphabet"" [super silly!].

""You Nazsty Spy"" features Moe's classic Hitler impersonation, Curly doing a brief Mussolini bit, clever word play, and plenty of wonderful gags.

""No Census, No Feeling"" isn't the cleverest episode, and seems to get lost in midstream.

OVERALL, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for the quality of the episodes, for the excellent results on the ""new"" color, and for the opportunity to see something new in the old!!!",1112659200,5,2533,4.816705336426915
2073446,5,B0002A2WFY,"What a treat to be able to see something ""new"" after so many, many years and so many, many viewings of these classic episodes in black and white.  The ""new"" color is absolutely dazzling---quite an incredible technical accomplishment.

These four episodes contain some of the most classic Stooge gags ever.  ""Punch Drinks"" was actually written by the Stooges, and all three are prominently featured, including Larry with his actual violin playing, and then his scrambling through town to locate music to help Curly defeat his boxing opponent [""that weasel tune""], as the music gives him unbeatable strength.  ""Playing The Ponies"" is one of the all-time cleverest Stooge features: Curly cooking up hilarious fun in the restaurant kitchen, Larry constantly getting frustrated (by Moe, of course) when he tries to pilfer a few cents from the till, and that entire, hilarious horse race-- hot pepper, speed-induced, water-chasing sequence.  In their Academy Award nominated ""Men In Black,"" the Stooges play medical interns at Los Arms Hospital, and we learn that they graduated med school with the highest temperatures in their class!  [Some class!]  ""For duty and humanity!""  ""The Sitter Downers,"" the weakest of these episodes, still has some very clever gags and funny moments, as the guys play newlyweds who get a free house (which they have to put together, with hilarious and disastrous results).

If you think you would enjoy the Stooges in color (again, very effectively done), and remember these episodes fondly (all with Curly at his very best, along with great contributions from Moe AND Larry), or are just curious, grab this collection QUICK!  As a side note, I would like to add that, in my opinion, the treatment of the legacy and the product has been reverent in creating these exciting color episodes.  Thanks to the producers and technicians!",1112659200,7,1855,5.129568106312292
2073447,4,B0002A2WFY,"Wow. I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw this stooges disc in the local video store. I  thought....... ""a color version"" and didn't get my hopes up. Well when I got home and popped the dvd into my player I must admit I was pleasantly surprised.

 The  color looks great!!!!!!  It is not perfect but miles away from anything ever done before...the flesh tones are a little chalky looking at times, but they sure beat b&w........you do get the feeling that you are watching the shorts as they were really happening instead of watching a dull old black and white movie ....... I  love it ........

...if you're a purist then you can toggle the screen via the angle button to good old black and white. There is only 4 episodes on this dvd but three of them have never been released to dvd ever, so you can get 3 new ones and one already  available .....  this dvd may not be for everyone but I think the color version enhances and makes the stooges seem more lively and gives you a perspective on the past of days gone by. Old cars and props  look fresh and alive, instead of blending into the background.

I  will continue to buy these new versions of  colorized shorts from Columbia/Tristar. As long as they continue to make them available in b&w and in color on the same disc.",1109980800,,1281,4.3544303797468356
2073448,4,B0002A2WFY,"As many have said in previous posts, the early colorization process back in the 1980's was more of a novelty than anything else and after a few minutes of viewing a colorized black and white classic, it became too distracting to watch. The colors bled into one another, especially with the fast motion of the colorized subject and more importantly, it just didn't look natural. Even eye color had a flesh tone to it.

This is NOT the case with the new Three Stooges DVD release ""Stooged and Confused."" I just finished watching this DVD and was pleasantly surprised not only by the sharpness of the prints themselves, but also with the new colorization process. Apparently, the staff at Columbia Pictures researched original stooges scripts, props and other historical documents in order to come up with the most likely colors that were used in the Stooges films. The result is an impressive and realistic looking finished product. It isn't perfect,(the flesh tones tend to be a little too enhanced at times) but it looks for the most part like these stooges comedies were originally filmed in color. I wasn't distracted one bit by watching these colorized versions, something I couldn't have said when viewing earlier colorization. This new colorization process ""ChromaChoice"" actually seems to add depth to the picture you're watching.

Some purists will say that these films are best viewed as they were originally presented, in glorious black and white. Well, that option exists on this DVD, you can choose to view in either B/W or color.

2073452,4,B0002A2WFY,"In the early '80's,technology abounded as some of Hollywood's greatest film classics were given a new controversial,if not groundbreaking process now known all over the world as Colorization. Legendary producer Hal Roach was an early pioneer and innovator of Colorization. In 1983 when the Colorization company was formed,Roach shocked and suprised many film buffs when he used the process on some of Hollywood's greatest films such as ""It's A Wonderful Life"",the Frank Sinatra film-noir thriller ""Suddenly"",""Night Of The Living Dead"",the ""Topper"" films,Laurel & Hardy's ""Way Out West"",and the original ""D.O.A."".Media Mogul Ted Turner also took colorization to the mainstream when he colorized ""Casablanca"",""The Maltese Falcon"",""Yankee Doodle Dandy"",""King Kong"",""Christmas In Connetticut"",and other Hollywood classics to name quite a few. Fast forward 21 years later as Columbia Pictures are bringing back the colorization process and this time,they're bringing none other than the Three Stooges !!! ""Stooged and Confoosed"" is one of the two Stooges DVD's that Columbia is releasing as part of a high-definition colorization project developed by West Wing Studios. This DVD contains not only the newly created and remastered color versions,but also includes the original,restored black & white versions as well. There are four shorts on this DVD,most of which are classics from the ""Curly"" era that includes ""Violent Is The Word For Curly"" (1938),""No Census,No Feeling"" (1940)(this short is not to be confused with their 1934 film ""Three Little Pigskins"" as it involves the Stooges playing football.),""You Nazty Spy !"" (1940),and ""An Ache In Every Stake"" (1941).These are all great Stooges comedies and I'm happy to say that the color in these versions is 100 % amazing and a HUGE difference from the god-awful '80's incarnations of the process. There are no distracting halos around objects like the original,earlier colorized films and pale,washed-out colors on everything ! Other than the four shorts,there is also a great 8-minute featurette on how the colors were created and also how they used references from props,antiques,and other things. While the colors are not exactly three-strip,they look sharper,clearer,and very good to watch and appreciate the original integrity of black & white as they were chosen by the filmmakers. But the real showcase of the DVD is the ChromaChoice process in which you could switch simultaneously between the b&w and color versions at any time using the angle button on the DVD which I thought was really a clever and very cool idea !!! I myself am not a huge fan of colorized films,especially the ""classics"",as it ruins the integrity of the directors/actors' vision,but there are some non-important films that I enjoy colorized like the Laurel & Hardy films and now the Three Stooges as well since I grew up watching them mostly in b&w and in color versions as well. I highly recommend this DVD for any Stooges fan and I hope there will be more DVD releases like these to come in the near future as they spend their heart and soul restoring and creating colorized versions for these fun and great films !!! A small company called Legend Films is going to release the four public domain Stooges shorts restored and colorized as well on DVD in February 2005 and I too will buy it and review it,but for now,enjoy the Stooges in beautifully created living color from Columbia !!! If you're not a fan of colorized films,especially the Stooges,then don't buy this.",1097971200,,3501,5.242424242424242
2073453,1,B0002A2WFY,"The real problem with these new Stooges releases is that Columbia has used the excuse of the colorization to present only four shorts, some of which have been released on other DVDs previously. Furthermore these retail for 24.99 while most others containing more shorts retail for 19.99 so we are asked to pay more for less. I bought both of them used for under $10 each and suggest you look for them used if you must have them. I have already seen many used copies in stores, probably because there are many disappointed buyers. Advantages of buying used: you'll pay less and Columbia won't make any money off the sale. The sad fact is that if these sell well enough this is all we can expect in the future.

As for the colorization: it may be the best I've seen, which is still pretty awful. Very unrealistic hues, jarring color combinations, unpleasant pastels. If you know anything about film you'll know that if the filmmakers had made these in color they would not have looked anything like this. What is the point of researching what the actual color of a prop was on Ebay (see the self-congratulatory featurette)? The props and costumes were chosen for how they would photograph in black and white. They would have done better to just try and make everything look as natural as possible.

I can't help thinking the choice of the stooges for launching this new colorization line is an odd one. If there is any B&W material that seems almost immune to the objections of people who won't watch black and white it's the stooges. My five-year-old daughter loves the stooges in black and white and so do many people who refuse to watch B&W movies.

2073456,1,B0002A2WFY,"I guess that it can all start with the wonderful line ""Oh what is our world coming to?""...or at least the entertainment world?...at a time of bad music, tasteless and pointless big budget hollywood films, and lame reality tv shows, you would think the entertainment industry would would at least spare one of the perfect creations of entertainment history...that is, ""The Three Stooges""...it is just utterly amazing that while so many wonderful classic films still wait to make their debut onto dvd, here is Columbia/Tri-Star colorizing the Three Stooges!?  When I first read about this in the newspaper dvd review I thought it was a joke...well, it isn't...however, the fact that a bunch of people got together and decided to waste a bunch of time and money colorizing the Stooges is not what has got me angry...what does have me quite frustrated is a bit of a story that starts back about 12 or 13 years ago when I was a young kid watching Stooges shorts constantly on WPWR-UPN 50 (a local channel here in Chicago that used to play Stooges shorts all the time).  I'll never forget watching and I'll never forget the first time I saw my all time favorite Stooges short, 1934's ""PUNCH DRUNKS""...an episode in which Curly is recruited by promoter Moe to be a fighter because of his ability to become violently crazy whenever he hears the tune ""pop goes the weasel"", played by violinist Larry...Anyway, for you Stooges fans, you all know that at the end of the championship fight, after knocking out the champion, Curly then goes on in his rampage to knock out the referee, the Champ's corner men as well as his own, and then a bunch of other people (including Moe & Larry)...this of course happens because Curly got knocked onto and broke Larry's violin early in the fight, at which point Larry ended up having to drive a truck into the stadium that played ""pop goes the weasel"" continuously...what Larry forgot to notice was that unlike his violin (which he could control), the tune kept playing out of the truck speaker on and on after the fight was over and Curly continued in his hilarious & goofy madness...Anyway, I saw this footage when I was a kid so I know it exists or at least existed up until 12 years ago, and it is in my opinion arguably some of the best Stooges footage ever...but the big question is...Where is this footage on the ""NEWLY REMASTERED AND RESTORED DVD?""...it's not there...and let me tell you why I'm not a bit surprised either...The reason the footage is gone is because Columbia so carelessly omitted it from it's early 1990's VHS release titled ""A Plumbing We Will Go"" as well as it's 1998 VHS & DVD releases of ""The Curly Classics""... and I guess that Columbia either figured that footage unimportant or just too hard to track down...so, in turn, they decided to try and thrill a possible new generation of young fans with a mediocre-at-best colorized version from the so called ""remastered and restored original negatives:..where then is that original footage from ""Punch Drunks"" in which Curly goes crazy after knocking out the Champ and knocks out everyone else?  If you think I'm joking here go and watch any recent Columbia release of Punch Drunks...you'll notice that right after Curly knocks out the champ the scene then cuts immediately to a shot of Curly standing in the corner with Moe, Larry, and a bunch of bodies strewn about the ring...it's such a blatantly obvious cut that you would have to be blind to not see it...by the way, this is not to be confused with the footage from the much later Stooges short titled ""Grips, Grunts, & Groans"" in which Curly plays a similar goofy character (a wrestler) who goes crazy whenever he smells a certain women's perfume (I think was called ""jiyacinth"") and knocks everyone out in the wrestling arena at the end with a bell...I guess what this all comes down to is whether the people at Columbia have ever heard the terms ""some things are better left undone"" and ""if it's not broken, don't fix it""...at the same time I wonder if they understand that when something is broken, you do have to fix it...basically meaning, the Stooges do not need to be seen in color, but they do need to be seen in their entirety, without scenes missing!  Something Columbia has really overlooked...Anyway, I guess I would have been satisfied before I bought this dvd if Columbia had put a label inside the dvd case saying something like this ""HELLO FAITHFUL THREE STOOGES FAN.  THANK YOU FOR BUYING THIS PRODUCT AND LETTING US STEAL YOUR MONEY FOR A BUNCH OF STOOGES SHORTS YOU HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT ON DVD.  WE HOPE YOU ENJOY THE MEASLEY 4 SHORTS WE HAVE PROVIDED YOU WITH ON THIS $24.00 DVD... WE COULD HAVE EASILY RESTORED AND PLACED ON THIS DISC SEVERAL OF THE DOZENS OF STOOGES SHORTS THAT HAVE YET TO APPEAR IN DVD FORMAT, BUT WE FIGURED WE'D GIVE YOU JUST THE BARE MINIMUM...AND WE HOPE YOU ENJOY THEM IN THE COLOR VERSIONS WE HAVE PROVIDED EVEN THOUGH YOU WONT EVEN BOTHER WATCHING THEM, OUR HOPE IS TO TRY TO APPEAL TO NEW GENERATIONS OF POSSIBLE FANS WHOSE ONE-TRACK MINDS JUST WONT UNDERSTAND THE COMEDY OF THE 3 STOOGES UNLESS IT IS IN COLOR...SORRY THAT WE WEREN'T THINKING OF YOU, THE TRUE STOOGES FAN...WE ALSO HOPE YOU DONT MIND THAT THE VERSION OF ""PUNCH DRUNKS"" ON OUR DVD IS NOT COMPLETE AND IS MISSING ONE OF THE FUNNIEST SCENES IN STOOGE HISTORY DUE TO THE FOOTAGE BEING LOST OR DESTROYED...WE WE FELT IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO SPEND OUR TIME AND MONEY ""COLORIZING"" THE STOOGES, RATHER THAN RESTORE LOST FOOTAGE, OR ADD MORE SHORTS OR SPECIAL FEATURES SO YOU COULD GET MORE ENJOYMENT OUT OF THIS PRODUCT YOU JUST PAYED SO MUCH FOR...HOPE YOU ENJOYED OUR POOR SERVICE...HAVE A NICE DAY""....Anyway, in closing, I will simply say that I think the Stooges themselves would darn near roll over in their graves to find that priority had been placed on ""colorizing"" them instead of finding lost & misplaced footage...I only hope that Columbia/Tri-Star gets this message and others too before some other film company goes and does something insane like de-colorizing STAR WARS to appeal to people who don't like color tv...As for my fellow Stooge fans...thank you for reading...if any of you know where I can obtain a ""truly uncut"" version of 1934's punch drunks I would greatly appreciate it if you would let me know...God Bless!",1093651200,9,6308,4.693766937669377

I'm not sure how the ChromaChoice process works, but a great deal of hard work and attention to detail obviously went into this project. As a seasoned film buff and dedicated Stooge fan, I have only praise for the high quality color picture that has been produced here.

Like others who appreciate classic films, I have no desire to view a colorized version of ""Casablanca,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""The Maltese Falcon,"" ""D.O.A.,"" ""The Third Man,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" or any other film that uses B&W to create a mood or atmosphere.

Let's be honest folks. The Three Stooges shorts were shot in B&W for budgetary reasons. The boys themselves would be the first to tell you that they were hardly trying to create a film noir experience! As a matter of fact, they would probably be quite flattered that their work was still generating this much interest 70 years later.

As others have pointed out, it would be nice if Columbia Pictures would also concentrate on converting the remaining shorts to DVD. With each passing year, they are missing out on an extremely large market of Baby Boomers who grew up with the Stooges - and are not getting any younger.

Congratulations to ChromaChoice on the amazing color process. If I did not know otherwise, I would think that these shorts were shot in color. The process is that convincing. See for yourself. This process is more than a novelty and just may introduce the Stooges to a new generation of viewers who change the channel when B&W appears on the TV screen.

How about the Feature length movies, missing Shemp films, and where are ANY of the Besser shorts. Instead of spending the months between Stooge DVD releases changing the films, let's get them ALL out first, THEN release ""special"" editions!!!!",1090627200,2,482,4.819277108433735
2073466,5,B0002A2WFY,"Everyone is giving this one star reviews simply because these are colorized? I could understand if you could no longer see the black and white versions, but the color versions are OPTIONAL! You can check it out, and if it doesn't look good, watch the black and white version! And by the way, the five stars I'm putting up is for the collection of shorts, all four which I have on video and have watched tons of times for years. To see them in color, while not better than the filmed black and white, is interesting to see from a filmmaking point of view and to see them in a way never seen before unless you were actually on the set of filming! And I am a film purist in that I feel that a film should be presented with the originally intended color or black and white picture, original aspect ratio, and original mono or stereo mix. However, I'm always up to try a black and white film colorized and a mono film given a 5.1 surround track... as long as I can still watch and listen to the film the way it was originally meant to be presented... and that is the case here with Columbia. They're giving people a choice to watch some of the best Curly shorts in their original black and white or the new colorized editions. Give it a chance people!",1090108800,4,1246,4.261603375527426

My wish - for Myself & Mankind - is that the Whole Stooges series gets redone in This color process and the Box Set Re released,
in Both B&W AND Color - Both in one set!!
This colorization is almost breathtaking!! I wish the orignial producers saved the outtakes and bloopers (Maybe they did. I'm not a Stooges expert).
I think I see these colorized DVDs are available in a set. (Of the ones that were done).
If your mind is locked into the B&W, - best wishes to you.
If you're open to Colorization - Get these DVDs!! Scott M.",1514246400,,585,4.376146788990826
