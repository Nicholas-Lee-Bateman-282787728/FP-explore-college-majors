8650774,5,B00JH1E0WM,"Just Planes videos of Boston has been producing cockpit and airport videos for fifteen, maybe twenty years now. I have been collecting these videos for about ten to twelve years and probably have almost fifty in my collection. The cockpit videos are especially appealing to anyone fascinated by flying and especially to those who may be pilots, professional or not, and those taking flying lessons or wanting to do so. The Blu Ray process has enhanced the cockpit videos specifically as now when the pilot/pilots describe the instruments, gauges and various controls the sharpness of Blu Ray enables the viewer to easily read and see these controls. One problem with these videos before Blu Ray was that often the camera could not capture these controls and instruments with sufficient sharpness for the viewer to fully comprehend their purposes and how they are used. In addition many of the newer videos have been made with multiple GoPro type cameras used in the cockpit to more thoroughly show the perspective from many points of view. These cameras are small and unobtrusive and can be placed in a variety of locations within the cockpit without hindering the pilots from their activities. The airport videos have a completely different appeal, with excellent visuals of a specific airport's operations showing the variety of airlines using that particular airport. These airport videos are a ""Plane Spotters"" dream. These videos are also greatly enhanced by the Blu Ray process. Just Planes recently announced that as of December 31, 2015 they would no longer be offering the DVD videos for sale, but, would be marketing their videos only as computer downloads. The market place is changing! So now these Just Planes videos will be available only on Amazon, Ebay, and through several airliner magazines such as Airways, Airliner World and Airports of the World. As all of the new videos are sold out this will be a only be a secondary market and only used videos will be available. This particular cockpit video is another fine example of the work of Just Planes videos and the only one of their videos to feature the A310!  SATA International headquartered in the Azores can trace it's roots to 1941. Serving the Azores archipelago primarily with it's fleet of Q400s it also offers international connections to Boston in the United States, Frankfurt in Germany and some other European cities. This video includes an excellent visual landing on the newest Frankfurt runway, 07L/25R, 9,240 feet long, in planning since 1997, which runway is restricted to aircraft smaller than the A380, B747, and MD11.",1452297600,,2607,5.048723897911833
