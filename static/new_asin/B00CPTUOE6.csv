8584843,5,B00CPTUOE6,"I can only find 3 Monsuno dvds for North American and they are NOT continuous.
Monsuno Destiny-Season 1, episodes 1-5: Clash, Courage, Underground,Wicked,Knowledge
Monsuno Power-Season 1 episodes 6-10: Breakthrough,RSVP,Appleseeds,Eye,Deceit
third release are the first 5 episodes of SEASON TWO, go figure!
Monsuno Combat Chaos-Season 2, episodes 1-5: Flash, Bang,Mysterious,Antithesis,Kidnapped
each is 110 minutes, 5 episodes. The first and third I found for $1 each at Dollar Tree. The second, I came looking for on Amazon, but couldn't find out what episodes it included, due to the listing of Monsuno Power having two front views and NO back image. I requested amazon show a back image. They declined, which was annoying, so I went and bought Monsuno Power at another site.
Info was limited when I researched this series, but, near as I can find, Season one had 26 episodes and season two lists 18 episodes with 8 more TBD (to be developed)-don't know if they ever were.
Will post this on all three volumes , for people who are trying to figure out how they fit together.",1434758400,,1076,5.084745762711864
8584844,5,B00CPTUOE6,"Honestly we have never seen Monsuno before but that didn't stop my 5 year old son from enjoying it.  He liked that the main characters were kids and that there were monsters.  We didn't think it was that scary, but obviously you'll want to screen it before hand if you are worried.  The show is pretty basic, good guys versus bad monsters.  It is good for a boy looking for a boy-show since so many seem geared towards girls.  The animation was decent and my boys really enjoy the characters.  We have watched this more than I would have liked but it does promote friendship, teamwork and decision making, well as much as an animated show like this can!

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1377648000,,727,4.462121212121212
