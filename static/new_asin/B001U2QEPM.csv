3795765,3,B001U2QEPM,"Gangland Season 4 seeks out new stories to tell within the confines
of the series, at times faltering somewhat from a more
intellectual, detached, newsperson feel to the stories, over
whelming viewers with facts and historical data while sparse on the
visual impact.

Or in other words, the overwhelming video support for the narrative
is as simple as the graffiti on various buildings around the city.
The lack of actual gangland violence completely transforms the
series, the viewers not connecting the dots about various events.

For one, the founding and evolution of the LATIN KINGS is told.
Based in Chicago, it stems from  Puerto Rican  and  Mexican members
as late as the 1940's.

The gang centers in Humboldt Park and members are required to have
the letters LK, or a 3 or 5 point crown (Puerto Rican or Mexican),
or 3 or 5 dots tattoos to join, after an initiation lasting 3
minutes labeled ""violation"". The colors  are golden yellow and
black, with or without a lion or Sun. Hand signals are used, as
well. Areas also controlled are Little Village, Montrose,  Crown
Town and South Chicago, with the opposition Satan's Disciplines,
sometimes dissing the LK tags.

The purpose of the gang, is to control neighborhood blocks,
extorting the narcotics dealers selling coke, meth, ganja, ecstasy,
or selling directly, consolidating power. The accent on ease in
buying and selling is such that calling up the chosen narcotic is
as easy and quick as ordering a pizza from around the corner.

The founder laid out a ""Code of Conduct"" for members, the latter
who are required to ingrain values through mnemonics, such as
Almighty Latin Kings Nation, each letter meaning a noun. He also
laid out a hierarchy, from the 2 Coronas, to Regional Officers,
then Nation Enforcers, Inca's, Caciques, Chapter enforcers and
soldiers. Both Incas and soldiers are subject to receiving
disciplinary measures from having infringed on the rules, by
physical punishment, ranging from slaps and kicks, to more serious
blows with sticks, a ""gold crush"" representing discipline inflicted
on an inca.

A surprising element, is the fact that it was run over 30 years, by
the same person behind bars, and by a right hand man in freedom.
The latter  met his demise only after a confidential informant
turned, with video and audio footage through a setup, such was the
extent that he shielded himself from anyone possible incriminating
him,  using stooges and patsies to carry his orders, such as his
girlfriend.

Another surprise, is the sanitizing of the episodes from the
outrageous acts perpetrated  by the members, using  a scholarly,
politically correct and light approach. The fact that there are
25,000 persons part of the LK in Chicago, and 50,000  in the entire
USA may have played a part.

A third surprise, is the extent and frequency of active female gang
member participation in setups, trafficking, getting information,
in being lookouts or in selling.

At one point, the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm agency) joins
forces with the county sheriff, to hire a snitch, install video and
audio eavesdropping devices,  intercept and monitor cell phone
conversations.

Gang jargon is introduced, such as ""running the deck"" being in
control of a cell block, ""trick"" meaning a snitch, ""riding with""
meaning the pals the person hangs out with and what streets they're
from, ""tumbes"" meaning to retaliate against a seller not current
with his protection payments.

The people interviewed advise they left the lifestyle because it
required a 24/7 commitment, which they got fed up with.",1266883200,4,3570,5.0563139931740615
3795766,5,B001U2QEPM,"I really like this episode because i know the people in it, Well my picture is shown in about 6 times, but of course my eyes are blocked out...  One was taken in front of my house.. Tiger is one of my best friends..  There is ALOT more to this story that people don't know and will never know...  You cant judge a person by what you you see in this episode of the show.. They make them out to look like cold blooded killers, and that's far from the truth...  And the devious one of them all was made to look like he had feelings Jason Hankins ""TROOPER"" is one of the worse ones..  He just worked with the DA'S that swhy he got less time..",1376524800,,638,3.9921259842519685
3795767,4,B001U2QEPM,"it is a glorified sensationalization of gangs in america under the guise of documentary. I am skeptical of the interviews they have with ""real"" gang members but it is possible that these guys are real and just not that smart.",1376352000,,225,4.65
3795768,5,B001U2QEPM,"I love this series which was free with my Prime account, but Amazon started doing something sneaky. so you line up a number of free seasons to watch of your favorite series, 2nd or 3rd season in and Amazon switches the seasons back to paying status after they realize you are going to watch the whole thing. This is the fourth time Amazon did this to me. Amazon just lost a long time customer!",1375315200,,393,4.324324324324325
3795769,1,B001U2QEPM,I searched for Sons of Anarchy season four and this came up as the selection. Never having seen gangland I thought that was what season 4 was called. Very disappointed when I received the item and it was not Sons of Anarchy.,1375142400,,224,4.357142857142857

3795772,5,B001U2QEPM,I have the whole series.  Alot of information and each season has different information on different gangs  enjoyed by all,1355788800,2,122,5.05
3795773,5,B001U2QEPM,"Very well made series. Each episode is focused on a different gang, inclusing interviews from current members, former members, aswell as the law enforcement agencys attached to investigating that gang. Definately some parts that may be hard to watch for some people, it is an understatement to say that this contains violence. My only 2 issues with this show is that it was made for people that watch 1 episode at a time, if you plan to sit down and watch a few in a row, you will find it gets repetative. Aswell, the first season is the best one by far, contains all the major gangs, the show kind of goes downhill from there, but thats not to say it gets worse, just not as good as the first season. I grew up in a very gang dominated city and throught i knew a fair ammount about gangs, apparently i was wrong. This series is a definate eye-opener.",1325980800,2,851,4.3584905660377355
3795774,1,B001U2QEPM,"Gangland Seasons 1-6 is your usual glamorization of the Gang Life,Of Street scum,Of what Liberals feel sorry for ""The Disenfranchised"",The so-called victims of Capitalism according to the bleeding liberal,the Activist Judges,It gets 5 stars For INTEL that can be gained to fight fire with Fire. I don't want to hear the same usual defense of the Fatherless children,the haves and have nots. I grew up poor,I never thought of Fighting the Man, I rather be the Man than Some Poor Excuse,Poor Victim. And Join the Communes and Ranks of Animals and sociopaths on bent on the elimination of their own peoples and neighborhoods,I don't want to hear ""Sociologists"" talk about the Discrimination of the Blacks,Hispanics and so fourth and the banding together in Defense. All Weak justifications of Joining a Gang. You have Jesse Jackson(Like Sharpton,Race Baiters) Half Brother's Connection to the Underworld shown here,so it is informative,but is it History? I think the History Channel Like lots of Television has given in to What's Hip? and Sadly that is Reality series and History of Street Trash.",1292976000,2,1093,5.1807909604519775
