3945319,5,B002L5KA7A,"I first saw this movie {Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas/The Christmas Toy by Jerry Nelson, Frank Oz} over a dozen years ago and love the first then.  Over the years I have bought every video of this movie that I can find just so I can give them to people I know that like good family movies. The last video of this movie I bought for myself and I still love this fun movie.",1299974400,,374,4.123287671232877
3945320,4,B002L5KA7A,"These are two Jim Henson television specials which I'm thrilled are finally on DVD. The only reason this set didn't get five stars is that the clear plastic over one of the covers was peeling back. But otherwise, if you're a Jim Henson fan, you ought to get these.",1296086400,,264,4.408163265306122
3945321,5,B002L5KA7A,"Emmet Otter is a warm story with just a hint of humor, and of course it features Henson's usual high-quality puppetry.  My three- and five-year-olds walk around singing ""Aint No Hole in the Washtub,"" and I like ""When the River Meets the Sea.""  The outtakes, too, on this DVD are great.",1293753600,2,285,4.568627450980392

8372385,3,B002L5KA7A,"This Christmas special from the Jim henson Company is not up to par with his other productions but it does have heart and warmth at its center.  At times, it is uneven, ranging from silliness to melodramatic within a minute.  At its heart of this animated film is The Story of the Magi (by William O'Henry) with the impoverished Emmet and Ma Otter struggling to give each other a good Christmas gift.  The music is endearing and decent with one heartfelt song.  It is a nice family Christmas film.",1386028800,,497,4.550561797752809

8372390,5,B002L5KA7A,"This was a childhood favorite of mine, I remember watching this movie and thinking how real the movie looked to me. I wanted my children to watch this in hopes they love it just as much as I did growing up. The shipping was fast and it was worth the money movies like this are hard to find.",1326758400,,290,4.017241379310345
8372391,4,B002L5KA7A,"What a great throw-back to happy holiday memories!  Although many have tried, no one can match the magical touch of Jim Henson and his crew.  The different genres of puppetry are mastered and on full display in this thoughtful and rewarding tale.  My child and I laugh each time we watch this movie during the holidays, and we watch it several times. It never gets old as we sing the songs long after we are done watching them.",1326067200,,427,4.448717948717949
8372392,5,B002L5KA7A,So glad to see a classic such as 'Emett Otter's Jug Band Christmas' on DVD! It is a shame that this movie does not air during the holidays!,1325548800,,139,4.0
8372393,5,B002L5KA7A,"This movie is a classic.  Others had mentioned that the dvd was different from the original, but I did not notice, and I have had the VHS for years. The Christmas toy was a bonus.",1323216000,,179,4.114285714285714
