8104262,4,B000E1NXIG,"As a huge fan of Matt Czuchry's, I bought this DVD because I wanted to see more of his work.  This movie truly illustrates how talented of an actor he is.  I was incredibly impressed that he was able to act like a normal, hormonal teenage boy one minute, and the next, becoming a quiet young man disappointed with his home life.  When Morris discovered he had a life threatening illness, the way Matt portrayed Morris' emotions was very well done.  Between wanting to pretend that it wasn't really happening to him, to the realization that it truly was, and the testing of boundaries, both physically and emotionally.

The supporting cast did a phenomenal job as well, but it was Matt that carried the movie and made it shine.

I have been waiting for this movie to fall in price for about a year, but it never did and I finally got tired of waiting, so I bought it.  While it was a great movie, I definitely don't see how it's worth the $18 dollars it cost, plus S&H, considering it was made over six years ago.  Had there been more special features, I wouldn't have minded as much . . . all in all, a great movie.  But beware of the lack of Special Features.",1221782400,7,1160,4.333333333333333
