7683249,5,B01CIMBWUE,"I would give Season 1 five stars, but the long-awaited Season 2 is not watchable for me. The subtitles for Episode 2 and 3 (at least) are for the episodes in Season 1. Major snafu. Being a speaker of U. S, English (with a southern accent), I simply can't understand the dialog without subtitles. I called Amazon and spoke to several people about this last week. They said they would ""put in a ticket,"" but I have checked every day and it is still the same. Hopefully the changes will be made and I can update this review. Episode 1 was 5-star!

Update: The correct subtitles have been added and the second season is wonderful. Can't wait for Season Three.",1462406400,2,655,4.458333333333333

7683254,5,B01CIMBWUE,"I subscribed to ACORN from my Prime membership site for Amazon just to get this series.  This metal detecting hobby is a fascinating hobby and this series is well done in my opinion.  The writing is just fabulous and the characters will bring a big smile to any fact.  Series two is even better than series one was if that is even possible!  I hope this series lasts for a long, long time and it will have me as a fan as long as it does.  I doubt I could get tired of it.  I remember very well the story here in the USA of a young lad with a detector putting in a new battery sitting leaning against an old weathered tree, as we see on this series.  Somehow when he got the new battery installed by accident he leaned the detector against the tree.  Next day, since the detector had given  a strong signal on the tree, they came back with an ax and cut the old hollow tree open and out fell an old skeleton.  Someone had killed a guy a century ago and put him in the tree along with the axe they killed him with!!!  They need to add this one to the series three!!  I love this show.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS!",1459900800,16,1111,3.9954545454545456

7683256,5,B01CIMBWUE,Took my grandson to the library where there was a treasure hunt outside with all these detectorists. We had a blast and the characters on the show really do remind me of some we met that day. It's a serious hobby and quite healthy being outdoors instead of behind a screen all day. Nice plots and twists. Would like to learn more history connected to this hobby after seeing these episodes. They look like they've all had a lot of fun making it.,1459728000,8,445,4.373493975903615
7683257,5,B01CIMBWUE,"Works on so many levels- warm, touching, canny, insightful, lol funny, and celebrates people and relationships in ways most gentle, subtle, utterly natural. The characterization is superb. The writing, by Mackenzie Crook, who also directs and plays Andy, is inspired. Every episode has a new opening, of nature and wildlife, and shots of detectorists interacting with the landscapes are often stunning. Toby Jones is impeccable as always; the entire cast is marvelous. I was delighted to see Diana Rigg and her daughter Rachael Stirling, who bears a striking resemblance to her mother. The music often puts a lump in my throat, sublime. Words seem inadequate to express what's so wonderful about this show. I watched all three seasons over the course of two days. Don't miss it.",1515110400,,778,5.133858267716535
7683258,5,B01CIMBWUE,"I laughed out loud so many times during this show. It is hilarious, and the writing is amazing.  Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones are the best at playing off each other. I can't get the theme song out of my head, which is usually a bad thing, but since I love everything about this show, I just sing it all day. Sophie Thompson is fabulous. I use the word ""Clothy"" all the time.",1513209600,,376,4.1506849315068495

7683309,5,B01CIMBWUE,"OMG! I love this show! I saw the first season on PBS and came right on Amazon and bought it! And now, they have the second season on the Amazon Acorn Add On Subscription and Netflix! I watched it, loved it and it's on my wishlist. If someone doesn't buy it I'm getting it soon! :-)

Anyone that loves British shows, whether it's comedy or mystery will probably love this series. I love both genres from the UK! There are not a lot of episodes in this show but the ones they have are perfect. This time there is the baby going out detecting with them and it's so sweet. There are some new things going on and I really hope there is another season after this one. There is comedy in this but there are also real situations that can make you sad or things that happen in life. And HOLY CROW! The intro song and they play it at the end too, it cuts right into my soul and is perfect for the show. I must get that song too =)

Watch it and enjoy!",1476748800,,941,4.026737967914438

7683313,5,B01CIMBWUE,Just fun to watch.  As a detectorist myself I see that the hobby is much the same in England as it is here.  Someone is always trying to horn in on your territory.  Given the long history of England I can understand why metal detecting tours of England are offered here in the states.  Like to go sometime.,1476316800,3,306,4.224137931034483
7683314,5,B01CIMBWUE,"The title of the show, while accurate about a pair of metal detecting hobbiests, is not ""the"" story line. There are multiple story lines that overlap, giving opportunity for character development. The show explores traditional gender and career roles being reversed, strong female roles, happiness, friendship, career apathy, and failed relationships. Each piece fits into the story.  Best of all, done tongue in cheek with a distinct English flair. Could have been called Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.",1475712000,6,514,5.425

7683348,3,B01CIMBWUE,"I enjoyed the first season of the Detectorists, and the second season was also a treat. One episode had me jumping up from the couch and doing a Gold Dance along with the characters.  I was glad to see more development of the female characters, the parent/child relationship, and the exploration of a true (and rare) man-to-man friendship in which feelings are (gingerly) discussed. The sleuthing and mysteries are necessary to moving a plot along, but they bored me a little.",1467590400,,476,4.8765432098765435
7683349,5,B01CIMBWUE,"Starting a bit more slowly than the first, this season grows on you. The sixth [final] episode may be the best of either season of this brilliant show. The additional Christmas special, amazingly well done, finds space for everything, including the requisite ghost/haunting. My only complaint: too little of farmer Bishop, who nevertheless makes one of the funniest if briefest cameo appearances ever.

7683359,5,B01CIMBWUE,"... to Mackenzie Crook and everyone else involved in bringing this show to life. I have little use for TV, but this series is worth gathering up the family in front of a screen, sitting still for a spell, and savoring. Watching each episode feels like finding a small, delicious treasure honed by wisdom and wonder. I can only liken it to my all-time American favorite, Northern Exposure, although Detectorists charms with a quieter and even more earthy aesthetic. The ""plot"" unfolds deliberately, giving us the chance to know the characters and love their idiosyncrasies. Their relationships make sense, complete with the scuffs and dings of daily living, and we're spared all of the sorry shock tactics and simpering sop that pervade most of today's entertainment. By focusing the lens on the mundane, we are able to tune out the white noise of mainstream media and rekindle the spark of being present. Crook's deft direction shares intimate pleasures like birdsong, sun-haloed dandelions, bees, dirt under fingernails, and friendship. This is the stuff life is made of. Throw in the intriguing glint of long-hidden history and a gorgeous theme song by Johnny Flynn, and ""perfection"" is a description I'm happy to toss around with abandon. This season is every bit as wonderful as the first.",1465430400,,1293,5.046728971962617
7683360,5,B01CIMBWUE,"Marvelous show. Beautifully shot, quietly compelling, very well scripted and acted. Give it a try- especially if you like British TV.  It's SO different than I can ever imagine an American series being. It's funny and heartfelt.
Beautiful acoustic music. I've seen two seasons and it only gets better as it goes.",1465084800,,312,5.0
7683361,5,B01CIMBWUE,"there are so many good things about this series, I am at a loss as to exactly where to start.  I could make cute comparisons to the show being a hidden treasure, which by the way, it is!  Or discuss how the philosophy of living can be mirrored in the activities of the DMDC (Danebury Metal Detecting Club) but I don,t want to obscure the absolute fun and delight of the show as a whole.  I had seen the first season and was enchanted by the mix of lovely English scenery and characters that were loveable and respectable along with their quirky characteristics and devotion to their metal detecting.  They are Detectorists!  This weekend I introduced the resident engineer to the series and we binge-watched both seasons.  He found it as entertaining as I had, and we both feel a little sad as the last episode fades, as if we have left a group of our friends.  One of the best things is that each season has ended satisfactorily and if there is not to be a season three, one can imagine the lives of Andy and Lance in the future.  Mackenzie Crook who created, wrote, directed and is Andy in the series has given the viewers a wonderfully real community of detectorists, who care about each other and the history in the earth beneath their feet.  The bad guys are those who try to take over the detecting rights and who are more interested in wealth than in the location and preservation of the past.  When the day's detecting usually yields only pull tabs and drink cans, one might wonder why Lance and Andy continue, but we soon see they are on a quest, noting all the bits and pieces they find as part of human past, but always hoping they will find something unexpected and important to the overall understanding of history.  This is one of our favorites, and belongs in collections for excellent comedy/drama, and for series that create a place that is joyfully revisited for multiple viewings. The hauntingly beautiful opening song sets the mood, and music and musical cues add to the story.",1465084800,7,1997,4.550279329608938
7683362,5,B01CIMBWUE,"Detectorists, Series 2, by Mackenzie Crook who wrote, directed and stars in the multi-award winning, critically praised production.  It is a British television series, a sublimely subtle comedy set in Englands beautiful rural countryside that here returns for a second go. BBC Four premiered the production in the United Kingdom in October 2015; select public television stations have been airing the production in the United States.

Mackenzie Crook (GAME OF THRONES, THE OFFICE, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN) and Golden Globe and Emmy nominated Toby Jones  (CAPTAIN AMERICA, HARRY POTTER,THE HUNGER GAMES) star in this production about two treasure-seeking eccentrics scouring the English landscape -if only their characters, Andy and Lance, could be so fortunate as ever to find any actual treasure. Meanwhile, these amateur metal detectorists have an unhealthy fixation on finding a fabled trove of Saxon loot. Andy has at last completed his archaeology degree, but he worries about providing for his wife, Becky (Rachael Stirling, THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE), who is none too pleased about the amount of time he devotes to this fruitless hobby. And then there is his newborn son. While he is also trying to live up to the expectations of his imperious mother-in-law (Diana Rigg --who is actually Stirlings real-life mother--GAME OF THRONES, THE AVENGERS). Lance, meanwhile, is still looking for love; someone unexpected finally walks into his life. And the oddball members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club (DMDC) return.  Once again, the world of metal detecting proves as tumultuous as their personal lives: a young German enlists the DMDC to uncover a mysterious World War II plane wreck in which his father was supposedly lost.

This production gives us a totally charming immersion in an English dream world of beautiful landscape and irresistible eccentrics.  Its ensemble cast delivers a tour de force of comic acting.  The show won 2015 BAFTAs for Best Scripted Comedy and Best Comedy Writing; Jones was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Male Performance for this role.  The scripts are astute in their warmth and humanity; the eccentric characters are deftly drawn.  Mind you, its not laugh-a-minute American TV comedy; it runs a little deeper than that. The box set consists of 6 episodes on 2 discs, running approximately 177 mins.  It has subtitles; a behind-the scenes featurette (33 mins.); a Christmas Special episode (31 mins.) and a behind the scenes photo gallery. I received this for review, in contemplation of an unbiased, honest response. There is occasional strong language, but I wouldnt deprive myself, or my family, of such funny touching entertainment for that.",1464998400,4,2683,5.276995305164319

7683364,5,B01CIMBWUE,"I was a little slow getting into it, (British comedy) but quickly fell in love with it.  The characters are superb, all with delightful quirkiness. Without spoiling what happens at the end, the ending was, to quote the British, brilliant!!!  I would love to see more seasons, but I believe this was never intended to be a years and years running show.",1463443200,,351,4.645161290322581
7683365,5,B01CIMBWUE,"Laugh Out Loud crazy funny. Dry humor that unearths side-splitting. DMDC (Danebury Metal Detecting Club) members are hilariously quirky characters. Suffolk film location is beautiful to view. But it is the masterful comic writing and acting that won season one a BAFTA for Best Situational Comedy; and detectorists II is added rib-tickling. The DMDC, always detectoring for a primo GOLD find, typically must settle for milk bottle caps and farm machinery parts. Common folk full of quirks & foibles, but DMDCs really dig one another.

Cast is a LARGE part of the sidesplitting success. Mackenzie Crook (Pirates of the Caribbean) plays Andy, simultaneously writer/director. Mack Crook is to detectorists that Jeff Foxworthy is to Rednecks. Andy is a quasi-sane MrMom, an out-of-work archeologist. Lance (Toby Jones Harry Potter & Titanic miniseries) definitely off-norm, divorced, but a devoted detectoring partner, and now with feelings. Other DMDC-ers include Rachael Stirling (Bletchley Circle) as Andys wife Becky; Aimee-Ffion Edwards as beautiful Sophie, normal other than her comradery with DMDC; Gerard Horan as the DMDC leader and Sophie Thompson (Emma) as his blonde wife; Divian Ladwa & Pearce Quigley play another beyond-odd pair of DMDC (Hugh & Russell) often teeming in ridiculousity; Orion Ben & Laura Checkley are DMDC quiet partners Varde & Louise. Diana Rigg (Bleak House) is the mother-in-law.

7683366,5,B01CIMBWUE,"Compare the cover of Series 1 to Series 2 and you'll immediately notice a difference. Andy is wearing a front baby carrier! Yes, Andy and Becky are married and have 3 month-old Stanley, a detectorist in training. Or maybe Stan is an archeologist-in-training because Andy passed his exams and is officially an archeologist.

But, he hasn't found a job, yet, so he's a house-husband while Becky has gone back to being a school-teacher and it's driving her crazy.  There are several mini-plots that wend their way through the Series 2 episodes. They curve around each other and intersect and, most important, make me grin and chuckle. I think Series 2 has more laugh-out-loud moments than the first series. And the whole shebang is heart-warming and life-affirming in the most un-cliched way:
A. Will Andy find a job in his chosen field, or be reduced to part-time catering?
B.  What new jobs will Russell and Hugh take on with their ""Lost Jewelry Recovery"" business? And will it involve blackmail?
C.  Will the DMC be able to help Peter find the crashed WWII German bomber in which his grandfather died?
D.  No spoilers, but there's a sweet story involving Lance and a surprise from his past.

And those don't include other funny moments, such as when Sheila recommends a club fund-raiser, a naked DMC detectorist calendar. And a discouraged Lance describes a useless piece of metal he finds in a field as a BOAT (bit off a tractor). And let us not forget Lance's ""classic"" car, a bright yellow prone-to-chug Triumph TR7.

Series 2 of ""The Detectorists"" originally aired in 2015. It has 6 episodes totaling 178 minutes. The DVD presents the show in 16:9 widescreen and stereo. English subtitles are available on the episodes and the first two Bonus Features.

....Bonus Features
....1. Christmas Special (30 minutes) Lance visits the British Museum. He passes the Lewis Chessmen and the Sutton Hoo helmet without a glance. Because he's there for a special exhibit. He stops in front of a case with a single object and reads the label: ""Late Saxon Gold and Jewelled Aestel, Henburystone Essex."" Why is he visiting this gold artifact, and why isn't Andy with him? What happens if you suffer from ""The Curse of the Gold""?
....2. A Day Out With Detectorists (33 minutes) It's the day that they film the DMC-sponsored rally scenes, in the field where the German bomber went down. Commentators include Adam Tandy (producer), Jim Reid (executive producer), MacKenzie Crook (writer/director and plays Andy Stone), Sophie Thompson (plays Sheila), Toby Jones (plays Lance Stater), Gerard Horan (plays Terry), Laura Checkley (plays Louise), Orion Ben (plays Varde), Pearce Quigley (plays Russell), Divian Ladwa (plays Hugh), William and Anne Crockatt (owns the farm where they filmed most outdoor scenes), Alexa Davies (plays Kate) and Jackie Vernon (costume designer).
Throughout the day, people are swatting at bugs and scratching as they're being filmed. As Tandy says, ""In the last week all of the insects in Suffolk have decided to hatch out and come and visit us.""
....3. Behind-the-Scenes Photo Gallery (2 minutes)

A very recommended series. If you haven't caught the first series, you've missed the gentle humorous beginning of the story&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Detectorists-Series-1/dp/B00VKX6VWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Detectorists Series 1</a>

8753089,5,B01CIMBWUE,"One of the best, most unique shows in modern history.  Gentle comedy, light drama, amazingly well done, and great re watch value because of all the detail and hidden gems.  Two warnings:  it would almost be rated G, except there are a few harsh swear words (by US standards) scattered about.  If you're starting from the beginning, give it at least three (half hour) episodes before you make up your mind.  It took me (and others) that to really get a grip on what you're watching.  I almost gave up.  Very glad I didn't.  One of the best bonuses is discussing it with others watching it.  Brilliantly written is the only way to describe it.",1533772800,,641,4.504347826086956
