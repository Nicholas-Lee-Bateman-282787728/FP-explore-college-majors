3862559,5,B00278FS8W,I love the walk away belt!  I can see the results of a slimmer waist already!!!!!! Walking is the key to consistent weight loss!,1388620800,,128,4.333333333333333
3862560,5,B00278FS8W,"This is a great package of exercise products. I have difficulty with the DVDs that have you on the floor or routines that are complicated. Leslie Sansone just has you walking. Couldn't be easier. While her program is for basically walking in place, it's the intensity that helps lose weight.  These is also a variety of steps -- marching, side steps, kicks, and back kicks -- that break what could be monotonous. This package includes three DVDs, a resistance band, fist cuff, and walk belt. Everything you need for a good walking program.",1386720000,,539,4.795698924731183
3862561,5,B00278FS8W,"These are fun and worthwhile workouts.  Personally, I don't like the band workout as much as the others (nor do I like that rubbery smell on my hands!), but the cuff and waistband workouts are excellent.",1353888000,4,203,4.638888888888889
3862562,5,B00278FS8W,"i have another basic walk at home dvd by Leslie and enjoy it but wanted something more challenging. a shopping channel featured this kit recently but i used a gc to purchase it on amazon. love having three dvds in this kit to change it up day by day. she lets you know the miles you've reached so if i only have time for 1 mile before work it only takes about 15 minutes or so. i enjoy using the tools especially the arm bands, like the music, like Leslie's enthusiasm, and basically can't say anything negative. it saved me from an expensive gym membership!",1335139200,,558,4.3238095238095235
3862563,5,B00278FS8W,"Leslie Sansone has great workouts that work on toning all of your muscle groups.  I like this set because it comes with three separate workouts - a one-mile, two-mile, and three-mile.  It has all of the accessories needed for the full workouts included.  I do the two-mile (30 minute) workout most often, and it really helps keep me in shape!",1321228800,2,342,4.666666666666667
3862564,5,B00278FS8W,"I love Leslie's workouts because the moves are simple and easy to follow.  She makes it OK to reduce the moves to your level when you're beginning, but helps make it a challenge when you're stronger.  This particular set is tough... it kicks my butt every time!  I love that it comes with the ankle cuffs, the waistline belt, and the firming band.  They add to the intensity when you're ready for it and can be used with other Leslie DVDs as well as non-Leslie workouts.  It's a great set!",1306022400,2,489,4.388888888888889
3862565,1,B00278FS8W,"Amazon quickly replaced my first kit order as the ""Hips & Thighs"" disc was bad. The second kit had the same issue with the disc. I could only hear the base booming but could not hear what Leslie was saying. I gave up on returning it as I liked the other two discs and exercises. Just avoid buying this kit--buy the items separately.",1300579200,2,332,4.285714285714286
3862566,4,B00278FS8W,"If you're a Leslie Sansone/Walk At Home fan, this little kit is perfect! I had been wanting to get some of her tools but didn't want to purchase them individually, so I kept putting it off. Then I found this little kit and it's perfect. It gives you 3 dvds and 3 tools (the walk belt, the fit band, and the fit cuffs. So far, I've done two of the dvds and have found them to be very good high energy workouts.",1295481600,9,409,4.0
3862567,5,B00278FS8W,"This item was priced less than the same items with other sellers. It was delivered quickly and in the same condition as described.

The product is great for my life style and enables me to exercise at home and expand the walking workout with Leslie that I'm currently doing on cable tv through Exercise TV.  The ""boosters"" provided allow me to add strength/resistance training to my cardio workout as well as toning activities.  I'm very happy with this purchase at Amazon.com.",1269648000,14,477,4.864197530864198

8354253,3,B00278FS8W,"I usually like Leslie, and I liked the idea of getting all the boosters in one box. I did each of the workouts included separately, and reviewed them that way:
Walk & Firm
This was Leslie, working out alone. She calls it a circuit. It consists of walking for several minutes than entirely stopping and toning with the band for a few minutes. Typically when Leslie adds the band as a booster she has you keep moving while doing upper body, but that is not the case here. There is no walking during the toning segments. I don't know I thought there should be for some reason. It clocked it at about a half hour (32 minutes) and Im pretty sure you don't get the two miles of steps you usually do, but miles aren't counted here.
Walk and Firm Bonus 1 Mile
This was the bonus mile on the Walk and Firm disc that came in the Walk Strong set. Once it starts you see its actually titled 1 Mile Walk for Active Adults which is a nod toward senior citizens I believe. This is a typical Leslie mile as far as moves go, maybe a bit lower key than usual. What makes this walk worth walking are two of the background walkers. A lady to the right of Leslie cannot seem to stop her arms once they start going overhead, she is so excited, its the equivalent of the arm portion of the freddy if anyone knows that dance (and if you don't please check out Troop Beverly Hills immediately). Then as if that wasn't enough, there is a man in the back and to the left of Leslie that kicks as though hes in a lineup with the Rockettes. Now his kicks aren't as high as a rockette, but the angles, its awesome.
Walk Away Your Waistline
Another 2 miler from the Walk Strong set, this one Walk Away Your Waistline utilizes the Walk Belt. I believe I originally got this set because it was on sale and came with all the gadgets. I have learned when it comes to walking, I don't need, nor want any gadgets. The walk belt is a nylon strap which velcros around your waist it has a small hook at the back with tubing attached to handles. Throughout the workout Leslie will have you use the tubing or tuck the handles into the belt. I found the belt to be more of a nuisance than a booster. I put it on as tight as the Velcro would allow, and it still moved around all over the place. To add insult to injury, the tubing is far too long so it ends up being a baggy rubberband essentially with no purpose, at least for me.
Walk Away Your Hips and Thighs
This includes a 2 mile walk which clocks in at about a half hour. Then it has a toning section using the fit cuffs. These can be done separately or together. The walk is your basic walk with Leslie and doesnt seem to have any focus on hips or thighs.
The toning portion of this workout utilizes the fit cuffs (not sure I love the name of that) and is mainly toning movements with the cuffs on. I really like the cuffs and could see them adding intensity to other walking workouts, but for these specific moves, it was only OK.",1425427200,2,2944,4.166666666666667
