3938436,2,B002JHD7SE,I can keep this review simply by saying this movie was very bad! Low brow and not in a good way. Watching this one can easily understand why the scary movie franchise only became funny when the Wayans brothers left and the Zuckers took over!,1260835200,2,241,4.377777777777778

3938438,2,B002JHD7SE,"kinda corny but does have a few laughs just not enough for me. it cannot compare to im gonna git you sucka, don't be a menace, scary movie or white chicks.",1259798400,,155,4.032258064516129
3938439,5,B002JHD7SE,"I thought this movie was extremely hilarious! The Wayans family is back, doing what they do best. I loved all the spoofs, gags, and jokes. Megan White used to be a dancer until she made her mother come to her audition when it was raining. Her mother dies, but she never really got over it. When she moves to the city, she makes friends with Charity, Thomas, a gay boy and a few more. Thomas helps her with dancing, and slowly fall in love with each other. Thomas also owes [...]to Sugar Bear, unless he and his crew can win a dance battle. This movie spoofs Save the Last Dance, Stomp the Yard, Step Up, Hairspray, High School Musical, Ray, and much more. I highly recommend DANCE FLICK!!!",1252454400,,689,4.390625
3938440,3,B002JHD7SE,"I was primed to give this a much lower rating as it was not that funny, but then I watched all of the special features and bumped it up a couple stars. The parody film run still appears to be trudging ahead with three more spoof films this quarter alone; This one has what appears to be the majority of the Wayans family involved (I counted 15 total on cast and crew). I laughed more at the little background stuff people will skip over (tap water labeling, the Cheney tanker, the school posters) as the sight gags did nothing for me. The writing got a few good jokes in there but I suppose growing up in the Airplane era of spoofs has me jaded as to what is funny in farce films.

The Blu quality is excellent, even in the night/action/dance scenes. The DTS is used extensively and obviously by a soundtrack listing your sub gets a significant test. They apparently had the budget to make this sound and look good so you get your money's worth from that avenue. The special features include:
* Making of: 21 minutes of background story, creative process, filming and the usual stuff; lots of Wayans being interviewed.
* Deleted Scenes: 8:15 minutes of rightfully cut material - except for the alternate ending. The whole white vs. black suburban dance off was way better than what was in the film, give it a viewing, good music also.
* Dancing Outtakes: 2:26 clip of the Apple Bottom Jeans song dance off not in the film - some of the best dancing I have seen on film with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rize/dp/B000ARFPOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rize</a>. I was really impressed with the athleticism being shown, better than anything in the film; disappointing that the dancers will not get much credit except for a Wayans brother film outtake. It is edited to the length of the song.

The Unrated is 5:13 minutes longer than the PG13, and honestly, I could not watch the rated version as two viewings of this would be painful sober. One for the film, two for the BD quality and supplements. Enjoy.",1252454400,5,2064,4.778711484593837

3938442,4,B002JHD7SE,"I expected to be stone face until I couldn't stand anymore and turn it off -  yet I was surprised that I found myself laughing, A LOT through the entire movie!  Certainly no masterpiece of comedy but a silly and often very funny spoof movie!",1436832000,,241,4.333333333333333

3938445,3,B002JHD7SE,"I tried so hard to like this one but the acting from the main character was horrible.

Not to mention the jokes fell flat and were for the most part horrible.

I think the Wayans really know how to kill comedy and they have proven this many times.

For example Scary Movie 2 relied more on gross out humor and it got old fast.

This one was funny in parts but for as short as this movie was it wasn't enough and it ultimately a complete letdown.

Not recommended only parts I found funny were the part on the subway train and a few others that was about it.

I admit even though I think the Wayans bring down comedy majorly Kim and Shawn did a good job they were both funny.",1425945600,,674,4.068181818181818

3938449,3,B002JHD7SE,"As spoof, definitely not the best. It's worth watching, but in some scenes they go a little overboard until it loses it's humor. But that's just here and there. I would suggest renting instead of buying.",1411084800,,203,4.666666666666667

One of the wayans brothers were saying how scary movie 5 looked like crap and they don't know comedy... HELLO! This movie was pure s#%* and wasn't funny at all. The wayans suck! And so does this movie! Do not waste your time/ money on this unfunny garbage.",1358467200,,482,4.08421052631579
3938472,5,B002JHD7SE,This movie shows how funny the second generation Wayans are. I was hoping the DVD would have more outtakes and behind the scenes or commentary. It didn't have any of that. But it's so funny all is forgiven.,1356825600,,206,4.447368421052632

3938486,3,B002JHD7SE,"""Dance Flick"" is the latest in a long line of ""Airplane""-spawned movie parodies, this one a product of the formidable spoof-industry mavens, the Wayans Brothers.  Like most such films, ""Dance Flick"" is a goofy, genial and instantly forgettable comedy that takes on such recent hits as ""Step Up 2 the Streets"" and ""Hairspray"" as well as more dated works such as ""Flashdance"" and even ""Singin' in the Rain.""  As with all these scattershot send-ups, the movie defies the rules of logic and physics as it pokes fun at the accoutrements and style of hip hop music and culture.

Damon Wayans, Jr. plays the not-so-streetwise hood who falls for Shoshana Bush, a lame-assed white chick from the suburbs who wants to make it to Julliard but has to overcome the trauma of losing her mother in a car crash on the day of her audition.  The amusing Essence Atkins costars as Shoshana's sassy best friend, Charity, with Shawn Wayans appearing as Charity's baby daddy.

It would be easy to feel superior to a film like ""Dance Flick"" - as most viewers and critics apparently do - but a good part of it is actually pretty funny.",1316476800,,1111,4.676923076923077
3938487,1,B002JHD7SE,"One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The opening minutes of the movie starts off with you watching one of the dancers peeing on a rival dancer. Yes, peeing on another dancer. That is supposed to be funny ?!! In a latter scene you watch 2 teenagers having sex in the hallway of a highschool. And as the school's guidance counselor walks by them, the counselor tells the teenage boy that he should NOT wear a condom because condoms make you numb to the sensation. Seriously, unprotected sex in a highschool hallway, that is supposed to be comedy ?!!

As to be so UNoriginal, this movie also has the ""typical stereotype jokes"" about the white girl who is clueless and oblivious to the problems around her in the real world. And the black kids who are typical tugs, taking advantage of other people.

I would label the Waynes Brothers as no-talented ignorant idiots, but ignorant seems like ""too weak"" of a word. I need to come up with a better, more appropriate word to accurately describe their complete stupidity.",1308528000,,1021,4.604395604395604

3938489,2,B002JHD7SE,"Save your money!  This movie stinks!  My girlfriend loves watching dance movies like Step Up, Stomp the Yard etc so I thought we would love this movie.  The film spoofs all the popular teen dance movies in typical Wayans Brothers fashion, but falls way short of their previous work.  I have seen all of the ""Scary Movie"" spoofs and thought this would be just as funny, boy was I wrong.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1293753600,,425,4.397435897435898
3938490,3,B002JHD7SE,"Background:

The Wayan brothers are well known for their comedy/spoof genre movies. Between 2001 and 2006 they produced the Scary Movie Series (4 movies). With all the recent successful dance based movies such as: Save the Last Dance, Step Up, Stomp the Yard and You Got Served, the Wayans decided to produce Dance Flick as a spoof of all these movies.

While the idea was certainly original, this film was not well executed. Firstly, it is just too short, only 83 minutes. Next the storyline did not gel properly, it seemed like they were trying to force too much into too small a space, the result being that the actors were left on a lurch trying to make everything appear to be funny.

The biggest let down of this movie is the excessive dependence on the gross jokes. They relied way too much on these, in this movie they really pushed the bar too much on the gross jokes. This was the really killer for this film.

The Spoof:

A poor guy, Thomas Uncles (Damon Wayans Jr.) teams up with Megan White (Shoshana Bush) and train together with the object being to win a dance competition.

Breakdance routines are uniquely embellished with CG to make the impossible happen. There are some hilarious moments that will crack you up. But there are other parts, that are meant to be funny, but may only serve to gross you out.

Conclusion:

This film had a tremendous potential, however, the lack of a well developed storyline and the overly gross jokes, limited its true potential.",1293321600,2,1478,4.636015325670498
3938491,3,B002JHD7SE,"dance flick es una parodia sobre las peliculas que tienen una tema de bailar.  se burla de tales como:  you got served, stomp the yard, stand and deliver, y mas.  en esta pelicula hay unas bromas graciosas y unas no.  habia momentos cuando yo me reia mucho, y habia momentos que subia la ceja.  la mejor cosa de este pelicula es que estaban los hermanos wayans.  ellos pueden hacer cualquier cosa graciosa.  en fin no era una pelicula tan mal, pero no la mejor tampoco.  si a usted le gusta las parodias.  entonces esta pelicula es una buena para su coleccion.",1287619200,,560,4.465346534653466
3938492,3,B002JHD7SE,This movie tried really hard to be funny. And I give the directors credit for trying really hard. This movie is packed with one-liners and absurd sub-plots. This movie tries hard to be a good spoof like Airplane! and The Naked Gun. And in a lot of ways it succeeds. The stand out character is the dance instructor who has a very bad case of camel toe. And at the end of the movie she beat-boxes in a very absurd way. One of the characters is a gay guy that actually has a dance and song number. If you want a few laughs then check this out. Grade: B,1274572800,,549,4.045871559633028
3938493,4,B002JHD7SE,"The Wayans family is to comedy what the Jackson family is to music, they are legendary and have truly paved the way for alot of the stuff thats out today. I like the movie because the humor was relatable, at times some of the jokes slipped passed and you had to rewind it because you were so busy laughing at the previous scene. I got this movie expecting some corny lines and characters and within the first 10 minutes I was proven wrong. It has some sappy parts like every movie does, but they love to make fun of life and stereotypes. It was also very fun to try and figure out who was family and who was not ..this film is flooded with wayans blood and its great how the family keeps up laughs. I recommend this flick.",1263168000,,722,4.201438848920863

I love the Wayans and I totally believe that they do this k9ind of comedy genre better than anyone. The silliness level is always at a high point. They touch on everything and, thank God, political correctness doesn't exist for them! I hate PC stuff.....everyone is too sensitive these days. I only wish that they had hit on the ""Channing Tatum"" type of dance things a bit more (the guy who had that part was scary similar"" otherwise the new young Mr. Wayans was terrific and so were all the other Wayans and David Allen Grier, who, for all intents and purposes is a Wayans. If you love this type of humor....just do it. I don't get the negative reviews, no sense of humor I guess.
