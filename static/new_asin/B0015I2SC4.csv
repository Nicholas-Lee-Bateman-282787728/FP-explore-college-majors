8258623,5,B0015I2SC4,"Exquisite DVD of the King of Ranchera music!  A lot of effort was put into making this DVD; it is a great gift to his fans for the 40th anniversary of his singing career.  An excellent collection of his best songs.  Each song is a separate video and each is of great quality.  Filmed on picturesque properties with beautiful gardens, water fountains, horses, miniature horses, with Vicente wearing splendid charros; lots of vivid colours, visually beautiful!  And, as always, Vicente delivers an excellent performance.  This is a must for fans of Vicente Fernandez.",1430265600,,565,5.021505376344086
