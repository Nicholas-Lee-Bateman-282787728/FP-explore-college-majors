8338316,1,B001RN4JJC,"Unfortunately I did not open this package until after the return deadline.  The DVD is totally unrelated to the topic -- it is a monologue lecture on hip arthroscopy.  There is no DVD menu to see if there is anything else.  You can turn on the DVD and watch the lecture, or turn it off, that's it.  This is NOT any kind of exercise DVD.  Note that the DVD graphic is consistent with the cover:  ""Exercises for Joints & Glands"" but they burned the wrong material onto the DVD and did not quality check.",1445040000,,501,4.276595744680851

8338318,5,B001RN4JJC,"This DVD features both a short (30 minutes) and a long (60 minutes) set of yogic exercises for the joints and glands. Most of the exercises in the short form are featured in the long form. A different teacher models each sequence in front of a simple backdrop, and both are narrated by voice over. The instruction is good and clear in both cases. There is no background music, which to me is a good thing, as it can often be too distracting.

Many of the exercises featured are somewhat different from what I've seen on most yoga DVDs. The sets begin in a seated pose and include exercises for the eyes, face (including lion pose) and neck. They then move to standing for shoulder, elbow and wrist exercises, side bends, hip circles, abdominal contractions, leg swings to the front and back and out to the sides, and knee and ankle exercises. Next we move to hands and knees for the ""cat/cow"" spinal flexes, a kneeling triangle-type pose, lunges, and child's pose. Next, in the prone position, locust, knees to chest, ""figure four"" pose, and bridge pose. Each set concludes with a nice long savasana with guided relaxation.

The pacing of these sequences are fairly slow and gentle, and should be accessible to most people. For a hardcore ""power yoga"" person, this might be too easy, but could be used as a warmup (skipping savasana) or on an easy day. A number of the exercises presented are similar or identical to the joint loosening exercises seen in martial arts and qigong. For a martial arts perspective to similar exercises, see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Long-Life-Exercises-Donald-Cheryl-Lynne-Rubbo/dp/B0031EZWRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Long Life Exercises, Donald & Cheryl Lynne Rubbo</a>. I don't know much about Swami Rama's background, but know he was trained in the Himalayas. It would be interesting to know something more about the origins of these exercises. Maybe the accompanying book discusses this. I was pleased with this purchase, and would like to learn more about the yoga methods of the Himalayan Institute in the future.",1283040000,10,2100,5.191740412979351
8338319,5,B001RN4JJC,"The exercises and stretches presented in this video are simple yet very effective. Anyone can benefit from performing this routine. After just several days of performing this video I noticed a marked reduction in the back and neck pain I had been experiencing. I have also been sleeping better at night since I am not as sore as I used to be. Very rarely does an exercise routine live up to its promises, this one does. After trying this routine I feel like I am now ready to take a beginners course in yoga. Great product",1214784000,7,522,4.447916666666667
