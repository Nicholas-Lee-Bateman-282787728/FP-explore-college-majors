7880774,1,6305018901,"I'm actually too drained to write this review -- bad movies always do that to me -- but I feel obligated, as if it's my civic duty, to warn anyone who might be considering purchasing or viewing this god-awful mess-of-a-picture. Please, please, just take my word: this is one you'll want to stay away from. It's so boring and dull, so insipid and uninspired, such a poor excuse to assemble any familiar talent. Burt Reynolds? Wasted (despite his best efforts). Ice-T is barely in the film, and when he does appear on screen his performance is so restrained and muted that it becomes crystal clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by Ice's intense stare, didn't know what to do with him. Rob Lowe, as the title character, has never displayed so little on-screen charisma. Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed of himself; his performance is, in the saddest sense possible, a joke. Surely, Satan himself signed Mario's check for this film. The plot is as weak, half-baked and annoying as all the music involved (the utterly boring club song seems to continue on, literally, for the first third of the movie). The film's look will prompt one to seriously wonder if the Director of Photography was also forced, like one of the film's forgettable female characters, to smoke crack from a pipe duct-taped to his mouth. And if you're looking, at least, for stylized, shoot-'em-up-type violence you'll get none here. This film, I assure you, I promise you, has Absolutely no redeeming qualities! Please, I implore you, AVOID THIS FLICK! Don't put it in and get suckered into believing that its pace will pick up, it'll get better, and evolve into a decent denouement. It won't. It doesn't. It can't! IT SUCKS! Now, you have been warned, and I can now go to bed (It's 3am - please forgive any resulting errors this admonition might contain) -- knowing my conscience is clear, because I've done my civic duty for my fellow man!",1118534400,4,1920,4.786144578313253
7880775,1,6305018901,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. And unfortunately I've seen a lot of those lately, but never mind. How it was possible to get all the famous people who star in this poor excuse for a movie to appear, is probably going to be the question of the century. This is simply put an embarrassment for all these, otherwise fine, actors. They should be deeply ashamed. (I know their fans will be.) What were they thinking ?. -They were making a ""serious"" action movie, because it takes place someplace in Eastern Europe ?!. Reynolds is wasted completely as a dubious yankie abroad, saying lines that are badder than Madonna's dancing. -Yes, it's that bad. Lowe, as a druggie, is almost unrecognizable under a silly wig and Van Peebles' laughable druglord has got to be seen to be believed. Nothing holds your interest in this ""movie"" because nothing is happening, except ... music, awful lightning and quick MTV cuts. There's no story, either. Enough reasons to make anyone with the slightest interest in films stay away, if you ask me. In other words, it bears all the earmarks of a director more at home in video clips or TV commercials. -Another proof they make the worst directors. Oh, by the way, the DVD is full-screen despite the fact that the movie plays on TV occasionally in its original 2.35:1 widescreen format. Odd, very odd. Either way; avoid at all cost.",998092800,8,1399,4.645161290322581
7880776,4,6305018901,"Stilish action, nice filmmaker. Cool down your mind and take some fun from shootings. 4 stars for action, -1 star for Dolby Prologic sound. :( Good-priced movie.",997228800,,161,5.0
7880777,1,6305018901,"Incredibly bad.  I'm a big Burt Reynolds fan, but he must have fallen on hard times to make trash like this.  I'd wager it's the same thing with Rob Lowe.  Pretty talented guys, but nothing can save this convoluted story and writing.  Horrible stuff!",991612800,3,250,4.613636363636363
7880778,5,6305018901,"Crazy Six is an outstanding sci-fi, action thriller made by an unknown director, with known movie stars. One of the most original, violent and interesting 1998's action thrillers, this film wasn't exhibited at the  theaters and it was released directly on video and DVD. And unhappily few  people will have the chance to discover this different masterpiece. Crazy  Six is a dramatic action movie, about Billie, a.k.a. Crazy Six, a low-level  drug dealer who teams up with Dirty Mao (Van Peebles), in order to rob the  drugs of a powerful trafficker, Raul (Ice-T, with few screen time). The  plan goes awry, and Billie is hunted by Raul and his gang. His only chance  is Dakota (Burt Reynolds, who gives an impeccable performance), a cynic  American cop. The whole cast's excellent performances, the Pyun's daring  direction and the interesting story replete of surprises (written by Galen  Yuen) makes Crazy Six one of the best independent thrillers already done.  If observed with more care, Crazy Six brings inside itself an intelligent  metaphor about the communism's  fall and the re-establishment of the  capitalism in Russia. Dakota, Billie and the ""heroes"" are filmed  by Pyun's  cameras with a blue background (that symbolizes the capitalism),  while Raul and Mao are shot with a red one (communism). The action scenes  have a lot of style (Pyun films the shootings with the cameras shaking,  accelerated edition and nervous rhythm), and although Crazy Six happens to  be a drama, it won't disappoint the violence's fans. The DVD by Sterling  Films brings the main cast's  simple biographies and a trailer, the quality  of the picture is great. With certainty, the most original, agile and  interesting thriller available!",945820800,6,1730,5.140287769784172
