8176936,2,B000NDFI8I,"DVD arrived in time and in good order. Frankly, I expected more of Ushi Digard and this DVD. Price was okay, but I would not have purchased this DVD if I had seen it before!!",1358553600,5,174,4.0
8176937,4,B000NDFI8I,"I enjoy collecting movies like this, it reminds me of the good ol' porno from the 1960s and 70s -- don't look for great acting, but the sex is hot and the people are ""real"" -- this is before the age of implants and grooming ""down there"" so expect a lot of pubic hair ""bushes."" Also before the age of condoms. The people are attractive enough, if you don't mind 60s hairdos and fashion -- guess they don't have the fashions on for too long! The plot is very cornball, but the actors seem to be enjoying themselves without fakey moans and gasps -- a refreshing change from porn you see today.",1224460800,10,590,4.276785714285714
8176938,3,B000NDFI8I,"I'm not sure what to make of SKIN IN THE SIXTIES. I mean, I bought it because I had read about Uschi Digard and wanted to see some films with her, and she's prominantly advertised on the cover. And sure, she looks great, but she's in only one of the three films on here, ""The Madam,"" and is nude for maybe 5 minutes total!! So that was very disappointing.

On the other hand, these films are fairly hot. There are certainly a lot of sexy scenes in them, and they're fairly well done, quite realistic. I'd say they're a strong R rating, since there's nothing explicit shown, but there is a lot of full nudity of women and some of men. My favorite of the three films is ""L'Amour de Femme,"" with some women sharing an apartment, and they and their lady friends are often intimate with each other. Yet there is one frustrating scene in it where a really nice-looking girl takes her bra off and I'm like ""SHAZAM!!,"" but inexplicably the other girl immediately puts another bra on her and she never takes it off for the rest of the scene! What's that about?! However, a later scene with her makes up for it. Maybe she's the girl named ""Malta"" who is said to star in this one. Anyway, ""L'Amour de Femme"" is all girl-girl, while the other two are some girl-girl but mostly boy-girl. Also, although none of these has much of a story, """"L'Amour de Femme"" has the best one, but who is buying this for great stories anyway, right?

The main problem with these films is the picture quality, since ""The Madam"" and ""Take Them As They Are"" are very scratchy and look like they were low film quality to begin with. ""L'Amour de Femme"" is the only one that looks good. So overall, if you're really interested in 1960s ""skin flicks"" this DVD might be worth your while, but otherwise I would not recommend it. And don't get this to see Uschi Digard au natural!",1196035200,38,1839,4.390029325513196
