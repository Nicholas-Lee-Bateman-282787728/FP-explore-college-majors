8123754,4,B000FJTV6U,"I am glad I've tried this video.

I've struggled for years to learn spiking. What I've managed to accomplish thus far is a weak pass over the net that does not score points.

What I liked about this video, is that it takes a very slow approach, by taking the spike apart into manageable parts and dealing with one at a time. The drills are designed with just the right pace, targeting each nuance of a good spike. It took him about 15 minutes of instruction and 10 various drills to to get to a complete hit, giving my spikes more power and better timing. I am not there yet, but I am much further ahead now, because of this video.

I did try many other videos, but I found this one to be the most effective because of its organization and in-depth ,  no-rush approach. The coach seems to really know what he is talking about, and takes into consideration, that people who need a DVD like this, need it because they've used up all other means. I liked that each students demonstrated each drill so that you really get to see it over and over without rewinding the DVD(13 girls=13 times).

This video begins very newbie-basic, and then takes you into various advanced forms after you are ready. I was never aware that there were more than one variation of a spike.

On the other hand, I am wondering who is a potential target buyer of a videos such as this. People who are learning volleyball, who are most likely to be young, can probably learn these skills just by practicing and drilling endlessly, they are not into intellectualizing these types of things. I am a middle aged adult who took on volleyball about 4 years ago, and probably am the minority. Also, this video would be a good tool for a coach who is looking for new drills and ideas. But whoever you might be,  if you are in need of a video to learn this skill, short of youtube, this will definitely serve as a good tool.

Warning: the only way to benefit from this video,is to completely suspend your judgment of this coach's bad communication skills. He talks as if he just had a heavy Subway lunch. Without exaggeration, it goes like this: ""U gotta, okay, open=a' okay, yur heep-a, okay. Gonna be a little bit.. okay, moova da hip-a, okay to da setta. you don't wanna, okay to comama to.. okay, da netttta, you gonna be not so okay-a dere..."".

It is tough, but after you finish watching this video, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment for having mastered a new understanding of the spike and will be amazed you did not go nuts listening to Coach Restrepo.",1195603200,6,2526,4.426724137931035
8123755,4,B000FJTV6U,"Coach Santiago shows the fundamental spike skills.
1.  The technical and the components details of the hitting hand. For example, snap the wrist drills, swing forearm, ... and swings forward and sideway.
2. The process of footwork, how to hits outside, middle and across. 3 steps, 4 steps.
3. How to hit the angle, and down the 10' line by approaching angle and rotation the thump...

This DVD much-much better compares to others DVD that I watched on the spike skills.
Coach Santiago addresses all the fundamental techniques of spike. As a frosh H.S. volleyball coach, I highly recommend this DVD for whoever coaching 7-12 grades (ages), and specially, a volleyball player but never coach before.

Cons:
Coach Santiago's entire volleyball DVD series are ending with the word ""OK"", drive me nut after 45min. However, that can be and should be edited by post-video production.
After watching the DVD, I feel the DVD not cover much about the spike for $30.",1195257600,,954,4.913043478260869
