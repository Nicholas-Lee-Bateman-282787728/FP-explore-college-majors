2776775,4,B000NOKFHG,"According to this morning's Washington Post, when fans ask Peter O'Toole what his new film ""Venus"" is about, he answers, ""It's the story of a dirty old man and a young slut of a woman."" Unfortunately, that description is right on target, and that is what makes it hard to care much about this film as a whole, although the acting is absolutely impeccable. O'Toole, who is seventy-four and looks even older, milks every conceivable ounce of humor, subtlety, depth and pathos from the character of Maurice Russell, an old actor whose life has marked similarities to O'Toole's own. Maurice has messed up his entire life by his inability to stop chasing every skirt he sees, but although he has some regrets, his randy spirit remains indomitable even as his body fails him. However, this still fails to explain his infatuation with Jessie (Jodie Whittaker), the sullen, selfish niece of a crotchety old actor friend (Leslie Phillips). Whittaker is a good actress, and though she's no great beauty, she has an interesting, almost Vermeer-like face, especially when photographed in the chiaroscuro lighting favored by director Roger Michell. But the character of Jessie is so unappealing--at least until the obligatory change of heart toward the end--that it's hard to understand why Maurice is so besotted with her, or to root for their relationship. Michell and his frequent collaborator, screenwriter Hanif Kureishi, are well-known for their ability to unsettle an audience, particularly in films like ""The Mother."" In ""Venus,"" however, they mostly just annoy the audience, though again the performances by O'Toole and the others are enough to make the film worth seeing. Watch for a strong turn by Vanessa Redgrave as Maurice's ex-wife, who still loves him and depends on him even though she's not about to forgive him.",1172361600,13,1817,5.100671140939597
2776776,5,B000NOKFHG,"The marvelously sublime film Venus introduces us to the long-in-years but still-spry Maurice, a distinguished yet hedonistic actor nearing the end of his life and career (played by Peter O'Toole in a tour de force performance, even though he's in many ways playing himself).

Maurice and his elderly ex-actor cronies spend their average day sitting around in the corner bar and musing about how many lines they'll get in their newspaper obituaries.  That is, until one of those cronies, the stodgy Ian, announces that his niece's daughter will be coming to work as a live in nurse of sorts for him (""no uniform,"" he scolds Maurice, ""don't have a coronary"").

Ian has high expectations for what this young woman will bring to his faltering life, but when we finally meet young Jessie, she is a standoffish, beer-chugging brat, as rough around the edges as a manually-opened canned food lid.

""It's hardly been 24 hours and already I'm screaming for euthanasia,"" Ian hysterically tells Maurice, and Ian just doesn't know what to do with her.

Maurice, it turns out, has some ideas toward that end.  And what develops (kind of) is a sometimes squirm-inducing March-December relationship (no, not a May-December relationship - the age disparity demands a few more months of distance be added) that takes an unflinching look at what part of love consists of bargaining.

Maurice tries to woo Jessie, with varying results.  When she asks him who Venus is at an art museum, he tells her she ""creates desire in men, leading often to foolishness and despair - the usual s---""

And that's about right for describing what ensues between them.  It becomes almost a sugar daddy type scenario only without much to offer as the daddy and without much given as the sugar - perhaps a low-sugar daddy, then?

I won't spoil it from there, but suffice it to say this is a brisk and somewhat risqu romp, at times poignant and at time hilarious (and sometimes at the same time).

Peter O'Toole gives a career-defining (literally) performance full of bombast and pratfalls (some so lustily-performed you wonder how he got through filming without being injured).

My only slight qualm with the film had to do with certain aspects of the ending, but these minor indiscretions pale in comparison to the consistent quality of the overall movie.  Therefore, while I'd like to give this movie 4.5 stars and I can't in this system I will instead jauntily tip my hat to the great Peter O'Toole and round up to 5.",1171929600,7,2481,4.83451536643026
2776777,5,B000NOKFHG,"If you are just a little bit lucky in life and in love someone will think of you as a ""Venus"" or a ""David"" (as in Michelangelo). And for better or worse Maurice (a terrific, sensitive, thoughtful performance by Peter O'Toole) feels this way about a young woman Jessie (Jodie Whittaker in a strong debut). And though at first Jessie resists the friendship and mentorship of Maurice she soon realizes that this man who offers his love and companionship, wants her in as selfless a manner as possible.  Maurice is attracted to the youth, vigor and life in Jessie and she is attracted to his just slightly more than platonic attraction to her. Both Maurice and Jesse have agendas but they are not hidden as is usually the case in this type of lopsided relationship. Both are unabashedly upfront and without pretense.

Director Roger Michell and particularly writer Hanif Kureishi (""My Beautiful Launderette"") are tackling some important ideas here:  slightly more advanced platonic love (oddly stated but nothing is really clear-cut in this film), how we as a society tend to discard the over 60 generation, the possibility of physical love after 60 or 70 , how the fervent and physical love between young people often matures into deep friendship and respect but sometimes doesn't and more importantly how our friends can ease our path into old age.

 Of special note here are the wonderful scenes between O'Toole and Vanessa Redgrave as his ex-wife and mother of his children. There is a palpable longing and regret in these scenes: these two know each other as no one else does and despite this they love each other with that special kind of love reserved for people who have seen and experienced each other's worst self.

""Venus"" is a remarkable film about loss, love and about the possibilities of life after 40...if not 60, 70 and 80. Maurice adamantly refuses to ""go gently into that good night"" without a fight, a slug of Scotch, a bracing cup of Tea and a knowing wink to a pretty girl.",1171756800,54,1991,4.756521739130434
2776778,5,B000NOKFHG,"Peter O'Toole plays an aging actor Maurice (""he was gorgeous"") in this little gem of a movie about old age and dying. He and his friend and sparring partner Ian (Leslie Phillips) spend a great deal of their time lamenting their fates and trying to keep one step ahead of the Grim Reaper as they wait to shuffle off this mortal coil. Their diminished hearts, particularly O'Toole's-- get an electrical shock when Ian's grand niece Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) comes to care for him. This film derives much of both its humor and pathos from the strange but rather sweet relationship that develops between Maurice and Jessie.

VENUS is a small, intimate film that British directors seem to have practically a monopoly on these days. The lighting is beautiful, understated and low, completely perfect for a film about life in old age. Even at his advanced age, O'Toole remains magnificent, proving once again that he is one of the great actors of our age. Vanessa Redgrave as his ex-wife has a small but effective role with one of the best lines of the filme: ""After you are dead, everyone loves you.""

The last frame is VENUS is a beautiful and perfect ending to a really fine film. While this movie may not be for everyone, it probably should be.",1171324800,6,1240,4.68348623853211
2776779,4,B000NOKFHG,"What more can be said about Peter O'Toole's career? Not a lot. The legendary actor has appeared in many great roles and many great films. Yes, even a number of flops, but every great director and actor has had their share. Every single one, even Hitchcock, my hero. But when he is `on', O'Toole is simply unmatched by anyone in his generation. Richard Burton was earlier, Ian McKellan and Anthony Hopkins would come later.

From the mid 60s, when he made an incredible debut in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" through ""What's New Pussycat?"", ""The Lion In Winter"" and up to ""My Favorite Year"", O'Toole has shown he is equally comfortable in drama, epic, comedy and historical drama. He can play it fast, loose and carefree or he can evoke historical figures with all of the thespian powers he employs, holding his own with Katharine Hepburn, Alec Guiness, Richard Burton and many more.

A few years ago, O'Toole received an honorary Oscar, perhaps the Academy's way of hedging their bets and acknowledging his remarkable career. They may have been a bit hasty. The actor's latest film ""Venus"" is bound to earn O'Toole a nomination for Best Actor.

O'Toole plays Maurice, an aging actor who now takes bit parts in soap operas, usually as a dying Uncle or Grandfather, to keep a little income coming in. He supports his ex-wife (Vanessa Redgrave) who is ill and still lives in their old, ramshackle, badly in need of repairs home and carries a torch for her husband. One day, his friend, Ian (Leslie Phillips), an aging actor who also carries a torch for Maurice, announces his niece will be coming to live with him, to help with his care and daily life. On Maurice's next visit, he meets the young lady, Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) and becomes entranced with her looks, her coarse manner, and her unvarnished view of the world. He also learns Ian can't stand her and feels invaded. Maurice happily sets about coming up with ways to get her out of the house, so he can enjoy her company.

""Venus"" is a fun film to watch because we get to see O'Toole do what he does best. The role isn't a stretch; clearly written to provide a showcase for his abilities, Maurice could easily be O'Toole if the actor were less well-known and had made some bad career choices. O'Toole plays an elderly actor who once played some memorable roles but now spends more time enjoying a good drink. Sounds like a stretch, doesn't it?

Even though his body has aged and he may be a little slower, O'Toole commands our attention from the moment he first appears on screen. This is Maurice's story; his life, his loves, his friends. In telling the story of a short period of his life, we get a capsule of his entire life, we extrapolate the events we witness and fill in the rest of his life.

It is a bravura performance and a fitting crown for his remarkable career.

Writer Hanif Kureishi (""My Beautiful Launderette"") and director Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") have done a good job of crafting a showcase for O'Toole's skill. Once the story gets going, they simply get out of the way, which is a good thing. The story is simple, uncomplicated and flows along pleasantly. If anything, this uncomplicated nature makes the film resemble a BBC presentation. It seems a little small, a little low budget, as though they were hedging their bets. In case the film didn't turn out as well, they could always just show it on the BBC and BBC America and recoup some of their investment. But because it did work, the project earned a theatrical release.

""Venus"" presents an example of one of our best actors showing us why he has earned a lifetime of acclaim. It is a film worthy of your time and attention. Peter O'Toole demands your time and attention.",1169164800,9,3704,4.635670731707317
2776780,3,B000NOKFHG,"Peter O'Toole is one actor I'd pay to watch read the phone book.  So...I did sit through this movie, although it took me two nights.  It's wonderful to see him still working at his age and he still delivers a stirring performance.  Unfortunately the script isn't up to the standard of his work, for a a number of reasons that are well described by other reviewers here.

One reviewer quotes O'Toole describing the story as being about a dirty old man and a slutty teenager.  That says it very well.  The writer has attempted to elevate it into something meaningful and tender, but it doesn't really work.  Because O'Toole is by nature such a classy guy and we associate him with roles of nobility, I think we give the character of Maurice more moral credit than he deserves.  Or perhaps the writer did not have a clear sense of Maurice.  He appears to be a well regarded English actor, who has a lot of Shakespeare in his blood.  His voice and speech are of course, impressive>  Yet he falls instantly enamored with a girl of no remarkable qualities at all.  She has a young body, that isn't even that remarkable and she's tough and sassy, which gives her a sense of vitality, just what he lacks at this stage of his life.  She's needy and manipulative but has no inner charm or outer beauty.  She's hardly a Venus.  Perhaps if she were played by an actress with more charm or beauty the film would work and we'd understand why Maurice goes from a little interest into something that touches him deeply.

 I've given up trying to rationalize the relationship.  I think it's just sloppy writing.  It was a vague idea, that seemed good on paper but when actualized, it didn't hold up.  The ""romantic"" scenes, where he kisses her shoulder are not touching or tender; they are cringe-worthy.

The best parts of the film are those with the three actor buddies. The dialog is witty and there's some genuine sense of affection between them. There are some good scenes with Vanessa Redgrave as his separated wife, too.  A really good film could have been made about their relationship,

This is a good vehicle for Peter O'Toole but don't expect anything more.",1440028800,,2151,4.587926509186352
2776781,5,B000NOKFHG,"This is very sensitive, endearing and perhaps one of the most positive film treatments of a difficult subject: death. The film was essentially about the circle of life.

(Spoiler alert)

The circle was closed at the end of the film when the aged man Maurice (played by Peter O'Toole) was tenderly carried over the threshold of death's door at the seashore by a woman young enough to be his granddaughter.",1434067200,,404,4.757142857142857

2776802,5,B000NOKFHG,"I have not necessarily been a Peter O'Toole fan in the past but this  movie was so moving for me. He is an older man who was a prominent thespian in the past. He is dealing with his inner feeling of attraction to this younger woman but still realizing and respecting that he is an aged man. As a middle aged person I can relate to his feelings of what is inside as compared to what my outer appearance projects. He still can sense the beauty of a younger person  but cannot compare to what he has become through his life process, nor can she relate to him but can still sense the person who he is inside. This movie has moved me and in my opinion I can highly recommend it.",1360972800,,673,4.090909090909091
2776803,5,B000NOKFHG,"Peter O'Toole and the entire cast put forth a wonderful and bitter sweet movie experience.  In some ways it is tough to watch this sophisticated, aged retired actor, Maurice, played by O'Toole, begin his slide to the end of his life but a joy too, as he provides the young Jessie, object of his affection, with lasting life lessons.  The side story of his best friend and fellow retired old actor, Ian, uncle to the girl, is also touching.  And, of course, Maurice's coffee shop gatherings of friends to complain about getting old while downing pills and reading obituaries is quite comical.  Richard Griffiths and Vanessa Redgrave also star with measured, effective performances.  Loved this movie.  It leaves something in the heart!",1340582400,,734,4.975409836065574
2776804,3,B000NOKFHG,"Overall I liked this movie. I'm a fan of movies that take you out of the normality of everyday life and challenge you. I think all the actors did a wonderful job and though it was a little slow at parts, kept me interested.

I did have some reservations and I must be honest. No disrespect to Peter O'Toole but I cringed when I realized he had a romantic interest in Jessie AKA Venus. I just got a creepy feeling all over my body from the get go. Maybe in 2012 we shouldn't make such a big deal of age but even though they have chemistry and their relationship was compelling, I got sickened at times.

Peter O'Toole is not only old but he is decrepit. It's hard to imagine someone like him fawning over a young woman and not get a twinge of disgust. I found myself fast forwarding the more unsettling parts where Maurice (O'Toole) described how he'd imagined Jessie's naked body while he was lying in the hospital. How he sniffed her neck and whispered into her ear. Sometimes it was hard to watch.

It also was hard to believe that Jessie had the same type of feelings for Maurice which it was obvious she didn't. She teased him. She'd let him sniff her and spend time with her knowing she didn't have those same types of feelings. Jessie was very selfish and cruel. Even though Maurice was creepy, she was teasing him and in doing that it made me not care that much for Jessie. I think she hung around him because she felt sorry for the ""old coot"" but she dumped him whenever she had something better to do. It wasn't until Maurice became ill that she showed any real affection. She also seemed as creeped out about his attentions toward hers as I was.

What I tried to figure out was, what DID make Maurice so interested in Jessie? She was mean to him from the moment they met yet he is attracted to her? Are we to think she is special or is Maurice just so starved for female companionship that he would become attracted to any woman who spent time with him? I had to wonder because nothing stuck out about Jessie and other than her being young and him horny I can't see what he saw in her.

Another thing that bugged me was how this is another example of the double standard. Let's be honest. You'd never see a woman as old as O'Toole with a young man in a movie where they showed a romantic interest. We'd never see Betty White getting it on with Christian Bale. Never. Yet again society tries to tell us that it's okay for the man to be old but not the woman. I'm sorry but I know for a fact if a movie like this was made with the genders reversed it would be hailed as something awful and the older actress would've been made fun of and talked about til this day. But Peter gets nothing but praise for the role and I couldn't ignore what a double standard that was.

I admire the filmmakers for making this movie anything but typical but even as interesting as it was it still fell quite short.",1339891200,2,2903,4.25
2776805,4,B000NOKFHG,"There is a great line uttered by Peter O'Toole as the aging actor to his erstwhile female companion after visiting an art gallery.  He says something to the effect that men consider the most beautiful thing in the world, a woman.  When she asks what women think is most beautiful, he says their first born child.  I suspect there is a lot of truth there as there is in this story of aging friends.

O'Toole received an Oscar nomination (lost to Forest Whitaker) for his role as octogenarian Maurice who is struggling with his health.  His daily companion is an equally old actor named Ian (Leslie Phillips) who has his own health issues.  Ian's grand-niece Jessie (movie debut of Jodie Whittaker) is about 20 and comes to help take care of him.  She is uneducated blue collar girl looking for a job.  She wants to become a model.  Maurice takes a liking to Jessie using memory perception of women of that when he was 30.  He flirts, but she wants nothing to do with him.  As Maurice is a somewhat famous actor she begins to acquiesce.  He treats her with sophistication that she's never experienced.  They go to the theater and she's mesmerized.  He takes her to nice restaurants and she eats food beyond the junk she's used to.

Eventually Maurice, using his connections gets her a modeling gig.  Nude modeling that she wasn't expecting.  The film highlights the great O'Toole who was 74 at the time but appears to be playing a somewhat older character.  Phillips and O'Toole together are hilarious, clearly old friends in real life.  In 3 brief appearances, Vanessa Redgrave shines as Valerie, Maurice's ex-wife.  She, like Maurice is not in great health and deals with loneliness.  They have a great scene together, a tender goodbye as they know they won't be around much longer.

While the idea of a man romancing a woman 60 year her junior can sound pretty icky, for the most part the film doesn't break any lines of perversion.  There is one scene which seems to try too hard.  ""Venus"" comes from the nickname Maurice gives to Jessie after visiting an art museum.  This little film is an acting triumph for everyone.  It is funny, smart and a little lecherous.",1329436800,,2166,4.649076517150395
2776806,5,B000NOKFHG,"Before purchasing this film, I was not familiar with a lot of Peter O'Toole's work.  Of course I acknowledged his position as one of the greats, absolutely one of the greatest actors, of all time.  I have since then seen many of his classic films.  This movie slapped me upside the head and I was spellbound from the beginning.  While I consider it touching, endearing, at times hilarious and thought-provoking, there are some that may consider the subject matter to be a little on the ""ick"" scale.  (Without giving away anything, it involves an aging man in the throes of a mad crush on a much younger girl.)  O'Toole is still so handsome, and the chemistry between he and his Venus is remarkable.  If you are looking for a realistic look at aging in the life of what was once a vibrant, energetic skirt-chasing Romeo, get this film.  It's incredible.",1313020800,2,852,4.633333333333334
2776807,4,B000NOKFHG,"Sad to say I'd been avoiding this fine movie - I kept bumping it down the queue because I thought it was quite something else.  The trailer I had seen focused on O'Toole's Peeping Tom in Art Class act (a fine piece of physical comedy).  One could easily think it was the tale of a rather lecherous old man and uncomfortable, unrequited love.

The actual movie is quite different - a nuanced, well-acted and thoughtful look at a wonderful relationship that develops between O'Toole's Maurice and Jodie Whittaker's Jessie, grand-niece of Maurice's best mate, Ian (a delightful, hilarious Leslie Phillips).  Maurice passes along his knowledge and life experience to Jessie.  He takes her to her first play - they sit up close and listen to street-wise, shocking language from the actors.  You can see in Jessie's face she's agog and fascinated.  What Jessie, in turn, has for Maurice is vitality, spunk and energy to burn.

2776808,5,B000NOKFHG,"As a female, I often tire of the older man/younger woman stereotype that abounds in film.  That said however, and even while some of the scenes in this film were a bit disturbing to watch, this story is very rich, and the relationship between the man/girl is not as black and white as you would initially think.  As the movie unfolds you begin to see that their relationship has many nuances that even they themselves don't recognize at first.

I also liked the fact that we got to see older people interacting with each other as friends and as former lovers.  Far too often when we see elderly people in film, it is a caricature of old folk.  But the older characters in this film...you got to see them in all their ""regularness""....really no different than people half their age....they have the same insecurities, still act much the same way they did in their younger years...the only difference is that they now are dealing with failing bodies and death.

His friend on the other hand falls in love with her. She is 50 years younger than him and he still falls in love with her and wants her so badly, sometimes in many sick ways. She couldn't accept him at first but later when she became the cause of his serious injury, she dedicated her life to him until he died.

The story is kind of sick! I mean what kind of an 80 year old guy would fall in love and have these kinds of instincts towards a 20 year old girl. I believe the kind of a sick minded!

At the end of the movie you just learn from it that even older men are not totally safe and are still capable of harassing young women!

2776810,4,B000NOKFHG,"It isn't difficult to summarize a film with an elderly lead; they nearly always detail a failing body and mind, ending in a sad but inevitable death. It is to the credit of director Roger Mitchell, writer Hanif Kureishi, and especially stars Peter O'Toole, Leslie Phillips, and Vanessa Redgrave, that ""Venus"" is a little treasure, embracing the ravages of age and vaguries of love, both physically and spiritually, with a nearly 'gallows' humor that is irresistable.

Director Mitchell, with tongue in cheek, has described the film as ""Dirty old man falls for sluttish girl"", but the May/December relationship between newcomer Jodie Whittaker and O'Toole has a poignancy reminiscent of Burt Lancaster's unrequited pursuit of Susan Sarandon in ""Atlantic City""; she teases him, then backs away, and his longing combines the frustrations of old age with the bittersweet memories of the Lothario he once was. As O'Toole's character is a respected stage and screen actor in his waning years, it isn't difficult to imagine these moments having special meaning for him (fortunately, O'Toole is in very good health!) Eventually, the kinkiness of the pair's relationship blossoms into something sweeter and more enduring, tempered by a tragedy, and quite moving.

Yes, the film does end the way you'd expect it to, but in a small way, what the pair shared together improves the lives of the people around them, and the girl can face the future with a confidence he nurtured in her.

Other than the impeccable performance of the cast, this film offers a sense of timelessness to its viewers because it focuses upon the relationship between Jessie and Maurice, who are at opposite ends of the human life spectrum. Regardless of the age difference, they offer each other a unique type of companionship and love in the end. It is a film that is sad yet beautiful because it portrays both characters as being capable of both selflessness and selfishness in the end. It mantains its reality which is refreshing for a film of this millenium.

2776813,5,B000NOKFHG,"I admit; I have no idea why I saw this movie.  The film didn't look appealing to me and the accolades it racked up I just chucked up to pure sentimentality, especially when in regards to Peter O'Toole's Oscar nomination.  The film came on Cinemax the other night though, and so I decided to give it a try.

Wow.

I will never just automatically dismiss anything as pure sentiment again, for Peter O'Toole is flawless here and delivers what may be his finest performance of all time.  In all honesty, I couldn't believe that this man was doing what he was doing with this character.  Peter O'Toole has been lauded time and time again as one of our greatest actors who has yet to win an Oscar, and yet I have never felt that his losing streak was a huge crime given his competition (although how anyone beat his `Laurence of Arabia' performance is still beyond me).  His portrayal of Maurice in `Venus' has changed my opinion of him entirely though, so much so that I am livid at the fact that he has yet to win an `acting' Oscar.

Let's get on with the film review.

`Venus' is in reference to the pet name Maurice gives to Jessie, the neice of his close friend Ian.  Jessie is visiting her Uncle and soon finds herself in Maurice's naughty thoughts, and since he is elderly and lonely she starts to cater to him in exchange for his company and affection.  She enjoys his time and he enjoys hers, albeit for different reasons.  Despite the somewhat disgusting nature of their relationship, both O'Toole and Whittaker work to keep their characters sympathetic and understandable, flaunting not only their faults but also their humanity.

The script is extremely well crafted, giving every actor enough to work with.  The story is simple yet meaningful and the dialog is rich and intriguing.  I never thought that watching a few old men converse would hold my interest, but the bantering between Peter O'Toole and Leslie Phillips prove to be some of my favorite moments of the film.

The acting is superb on all fronts, but O'Toole and Phillips by far deserve the most praise.  O'Toole manages to make his character relatable even though he is detestable in parts.  He captures his characters lonely desperation that helps deaden us to his carnal fascination.  Phillips is a cinematic dream, delivering line after line with precision and comedic brilliance.  He's like a make version of Kathy Bates, providing comedic relief with reckless abandon.  Jodie Whittaker is also astonishing as Jessie, but her character at times proves to be more of a prop for Maurice's development.

In the end I have to say that `Venus' proved to be so much more than I ever imagined it would be.  With a marvelously astute script and a marvelously capable cast, `Venus' stands tall as one of the best films of 2006.  It's a shame to me that the Academy chose such mediocre films for their shortlist (none of which come close to my top ten) when they had so many beautifully complete films to chose from.  `Venus' alone is far more worthy of the Best Picture title than any of the five films Oscar chose to honor with nominations.",1219622400,,3107,4.646520146520147

I wondered if I would like it because so many critics were put off by the ""dirty old man"" theme, but that is really insulting to elderly people.  O'Toole likes the tough young girl, expelled from and shamed by her family. He awakens her to her beauty and worth; she keeps him alive. Each has a self-centered agenda, which is exactly as it should be, and keeps this exquisite film from being maudlin.

Those of you who are long time fans of O'Toole would probably do well to avoid this film as I have been an admirer of his work for my entire life and felt badly for him after viewing it.

2776817,5,B000NOKFHG,"Venus is an emblematic movie that deals with the human condition of a respectable actor, beloved and loved by many women in the past who lives on the verge of the forgetfulness, isolated and imprisoned between his memories (Like Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard) ; nevertheless Maurice is still an avid observer of the human condition and from time to time makes secondary roles.

The arrival of a provincial and alluring young woman, who comes for the first time in her life to London,  niece of his best friend, will arouse for both of them new horizons of unsuspected consequences, she is the unreachable muse for him but he has the spelling magic of the word; once more the wisdom and experience face with the missing energies of an unbridled youth that is aware it has all the time of the world for acting and mistaking, on the other side of the street, Maurice is well conscious the time is a no removable resource and enjoys every single moment of his existence, due a painful prostrate cancer may annihilate him in any moment.

However, the approach of the film is far to be tragic; on the contrary, it's a celebration of life a song for these splendid and irreversible moments that must be lived with Dionysian intensity, no matter what the rest of the world think.

Peter O`Toole gives an astonishing and vivid performance as the dying actor; and Roger Mitchell shows us his skills and superb god taste behind the camera, who works out as a peeping tom; needless to say as an extension of Maurice's personality.

There are flashes of the last film of Don Luis Bunuel ""That obscure object of desire"" , but the film will preserve itself as a cult movie for the future viewers.",1206316800,2,1686,4.625418060200669
2776818,4,B000NOKFHG,"When the Academy Awards wanted to give Peter O'Toole an honorary Oscar, he initially refused, saying that he still felt he was quite in the running for a Best Actor and didn't want to ruin his chances with any ""lifetime achievement"" awards.

I wonder if the makers of ""Venus"" were listening.  It certainly looks that way: the role of Maurice appears tailored for O'Toole in every scene...and it worked.  O'Toole received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor (he lost to Forrest Whitaker).

I remember reading in Richard Burton's biography that both he and O'Toole shared the same record: most Academy Award nominations without ever winning.  7 or 8, I believe.  So now O'Toole has 8 or 9, nearly 25 years after Burton's death.

It's a great role for a great actor...but I don't know if it's a great movie for everyone.  Some of it worked, some of it might offend or annoy people.  (I've noticed some reviews take O'Toole's age and lecherous advances to task.  I have to admit that some of the scenes made me uncomfortable: the sight of a very elderly man trying to bribe kisses and gropes from a very young girl, for one!  If you didn't keep in mind that this was Peter O'Toole, Lawrence of Arabia, the 60's swinger from ""What's New, Pussycat?"", you might think he was just another very dirty old man).

The movie does succeed in the weird desires and awkward moments of an old man enchanted by a young girl.  She's hardly deserving at first (which was interesting) and I felt bad for the old dude when he realizes he's just being used while a young punk boyfriend loiters outside smoking cigarettes on the sidewalk.  But who do you root for?  It's real...but the hope of happy ending is impossible.

If you enjoy great acting, you'll like this movie.  If you're looking for a whimsical romance...you might be challenged.

Most of it worked for me because of Peter O'Toole.

(Why do films insist on showcasing foul-mouthed old people?  The only ancient potty mouths I've seen are in movies, not real life.  Hearing Katherine Hepburn mutter the F-bomb in Warren Beatty's remake of ""An Affair to Remember"" or Peter O'Toole exchange the same word over and over with another old man in ""Venus"" is hardly groundbreaking or all that entertaining, to be honest.  If I want a cussing geezer, I'll just watch Ruth Gordon in Clint Eastwood's monkey movie, ""Every Which Way but Loose.""  That's about the level of that gag).",1203897600,,2415,4.711217183770883
2776819,2,B000NOKFHG,"This movie has some good moments.

But it is also wildly uneven in its tone.

Is it whimsical? Is it savage? What's going on here?

I think that the underlying problem is that the writer, who also wrote ""My Beautiful Launderette"", comes from the London milieu that he writes so well about. That world view takes for granted that all the ""isms"", all identifiable philosophical approaches to life, have been exhausted and proven not to work. Save perhaps a gentle absurdism and an interpretation of multiculturalism as all-leveling.

That leaves 2 hours of movie script to fill. So the writer has interrogated the theme of eros as a momentary connecting quality in a decentered universe, as he did with ""My Beautiful Launderette"". All of the characters in this movie are ""lost"" in reminiscence about the power, the connection, and the moment of eros. Maurice and Jessie even try to kindle a desperate version of it. ""That's all there is"" says Maurice.

Unfortunately for the writer, that turns out to be not such a gentle or benign observation. Almost against the writer's will, in a subconscious subtext, these characters are yearning for additional human value beyond the eros that the years have eclipsed. But the writer couldn't deliver it, because he obviously doesn't believe in it.

All the scenes portraying Jessie's friends and their club world flash by unexamined and uncared for. The writer sees no redeeming value there apparently.

The barbarity and cruelty of what Jessie and her boyfriend do to Maurice, both psychologically and physically is shocking and just turns the second half of the film against the first half. But it is also never interrogated by the writer. It just happens, leaving the viewer dumbfounded. The play-within-a-play where Maurice is filmed ""playing a corpse"" is materialized in the movie's universe and Maurice does in fact play a corpse at the end, sitting next to Jessie. The tone here is again sharply disturbing. No gentle fade on Maurice finally at rest by the sea -- the camera tilts him out of frame jarringly like so much garbage as Jessie panics and runs about yelling. The viewer shudders.

The fluffy redemption sequence at the end for Jessie seems tacked on like an afterthought. Who knows, perhaps the writer and director had planned to end on a down note with Maurice at the beach. It's a shocking conclusion after the warm first half of humor. That would have made a statement. But instead the production (the money people, perhaps) chose to ""balance"" the tone of the conclusion with the humor at the start. Too late though, for, as I have said, the film is already too wildly uneven.

But what allowed this loss of control, I think, is that the writer (and director) didn't have anything more to say after interrogating the sexuality, or the remembered sexuality, of its characters. Maurice and Jessie have a disjointed series of connection experiences, but after all she didn't learn any wisdom from him and betrayed him horribly. And he didn't have much wisdom to offer other than ""sex is good"". That's ok so far as it goes, but it is a severely limited perspective. His connection to his ex-wife is more an exposition of disconnectedness. They mention their children in a one line exchange about money, and done with it.

The writer missed an opportunity here to include an interrogation of the place of art in peoples' lives, particularly the aging actors and the young people coming up. Maurice and his friends never muse over past great performances they have seen, or given, as you would think aging actors might. Or they might discuss what the hell Shakespeare was doing when he had Hamlet address his step-father as ""Mother"", etc. Maurice takes Jessie to a play, but all Jessie can come up with is a weak ""I could never do that."" This is no ""Educating Rita"".

The writer might consider thinking more about the parent cultures in the London melting pot. I'm sure that there could be more interesting stories about Pakistani, Indian, Jewish, Irish, and English human values. Eros is a strong part of our individual and cultural experience. But it is not the sum total, except for old-guard partyers like Maurice (note the memorial reference to Robert Shaw) and new-guard partyers like Jessie and her boyfriend. ""That's all there is"" said Maurice. Wrong.

What's really disturbing about all this is the reception that ""Venus"" enjoys, as evidenced in the fellow reviews here. Sheesh! This film is not a celebration about human ""possibilities"". That it is so regarded is a very morbid testament to the fact that, sadly, this film got it right in many respects. That is, the multicultural landscape has already leveled human expectations to a near-zero; so much so that young people out there see this Chinese-corners version of the human heart as an uplifting statement.

Guess I'm in no rush to go clubbing in London!",1197244800,5,4875,4.887409200968523
2776820,5,B000NOKFHG,"While not a film for everyone, Venus has enough to satisfy even the most hardened film buff.  Peter O'Toole delivers a stellar performance not because of over-acting but becase of restraint.  Even more importantly, he allows a young actress an opportunity to not only rvial his quality but to spar with him at a level rarely seem in modern cinema.

2776821,3,B000NOKFHG,"Peter O'Toole, the highly-esteemed Irish actor (""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""The Ruling Class,"") received a well-deserved 2006 Oscar nomination for the English-made ""Venus,"" though, unfortunately for him, not the nod ( who could ignore Forest Whittaker in ""The Last King of Scotland?"")  But O'Toole did give a genuinely towering performance; and they always say the Oscar voters love you if you allow yourself to look ugly, or disabled, onscreen.  O'Toole allowed himself to look ugly/old, and dead onscreen, so I guess that had to count heavily in his favor.

""Venus"" is actually a drily funny, unsentimentally witty film, as written by Hanif Kureishi(""My Beautiful Laundrette""), and directed by Roger Michell; although its plot is rather pedestrian.  It's set among a bunch of aging theatrical friends, and gives viewers a pretty good idea of what their lives might be like.  Maurice,  (O'Toole), who would generally be politely called a ""larger than life character,"" manages to be a horny, dirty old man, despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that we're told a recent needed operation was going to leave him impotent and incontinent.  He falls in love with 20-year old Jessie (Jodie Whittaker), the hard, provincial, lazy, little-educated niece of his best friend Ian (Leslie Phillips), who's been sent to look after him in his dotage.  Vanessa Redgrave turns in a fine performance as Valerie, still actually  Maurice's last wife.  Richard Griffiths provides sturdy support as Donald, the third old theatrical friend.

The presence of O'Toole is critical to the film's success: most viewers do know that, in real life, he was one handsome devil as a younger man, and we need to know that in order to believe that a not-so-bright girl of twenty could manage to get to be fond of a man four times her age,and not a millionaire.  There also can be little doubt that O'Toole salts many of his lines as Maurice with his real-time lifetime of experience.  He might not have won the Oscar, but his performance still makes the movie worth seeing.",1194048000,4,2038,5.01186943620178

2776823,5,B000NOKFHG,"Venus is a beautifully crafted film, portrayed by some of the greatest of British actors, who have nothing left to prove. It brilliantly portrays the love that can be outside the ignorant, fearful and prejudiced world in which we all too regrettably increasingly live.

The film is seen through the eyes of Maurice (Peter O'Toole), a great actor of his day (in the film and real life), now approaching the end of his days. For those blinded by prejudice, Maurice is a dirty old man who takes advantage of a young woman. Those not so blinded will see a man who has been free to love whenever and whoever he chose, whose freedom and opportunity taught him what love truly is: Giving, sharing, consensual and encouraging others to find the best in themselves, their dreams, even if that means they will leave you.

However it is not Maurice's story. It could be seen as the story of his wife (Vanessa Redgrave), who despite being abandoned with small children, still loves the man - a man who could not be owned by another. Despite his latest dalliance, she knows the benefit love between two people can bring to everyone about them. But this not the wife's story.

This is the story of a Venus, young girl who has never been loved for herself. Rejected by parents, used and abused by lovers of her own age, she obnoxiously rejects the family and society that rejected her. The love she gets from Maurice, however impoverished, however perverted some may see it, is the Love that was the turning point in her life.

Jesse is unabashedly common, with any redeeming features so well hidden as to be practically non-existent.  She is so guilt-ridden after she and her boyfriend do their thing in Maurice's home, that any human being would have regrets.  This was no particularly warm quality of hers coming to the fore.

All in all this was a very, very bad movie with gratuitous and stereotypical and juvenile portrayals of the elderly.  Very difficult to watch . . the best part was when it was over.",1189468800,6,765,4.664179104477612
2776826,5,B000NOKFHG,"Venus, starring Peter O'Toole, is like one of those water-filled snowflake globes you buy at an airport gift shop - except that it's made by Faberge.  It's a tiny, complete world of exquisite beauty - as your imagination drifts into it the outside world disappears.  Most movies have gunfights - this movie has two old man beating each other with rolled up newspapers.  Most movies reek with profanity and trash talk - here you can see a surly, provincial young woman transported by the music of an old man reciting lines from Hamlet.  Most movies fawn over the advantages of youth, this movie shows you old men, and women, taking inventory at the end of their lives, trying to die with dignity.

Even more remarkable, this movie explores the virtually uncharted terrain of asexual love between a man and woman who are separated by two full generations - a love that is all the same powerful and redemptive for both.  The subject matter is risky, and in lesser hands might have become tawdry.  But it is handled with such authenticity and dignity that there's nary a smutty schoolyard giggle to be found.  The depiction of old people is refreshing.  America fears the aged so deeply that they rarely appear in films at all, and when they do, it is usually in cameo roles playing doorstops, table lamps, and magazine racks.  But these old people are vital, full of attitude, wit, edge, sarcasm, and wisdom.  They're wonderful to be around and we're enriched by watching them interact.

Director Roger Mitchell has an extraordinary touch; the film is simultaneously romantic and tough-minded.  Writer Hanif Kureishi, who gave us the masterpiece - My Beautiful Launderette - is characteristically unsentimental and honest about the lonely, yet lovely, places within the human heart.  The cast is simply overwhelming.  Peter O'Toole speaks the English language more beautifully than any actor I can name, with the possible exception of Jeremy Irons.  Considering he is playing an actor, he might easily have turned up the juice too high - but he never does.  His portrayal of Maurice is Oscar level.  To see O'Toole and Vanessa Redgrave conversing like any old couple is to witness acting royalty in action, they are amazing together.  Leslie Phillips, who plays Maurice's fellow actor and dear friend Ian, practically walks off with the film several times, he is that good.

Tiptoe-ing among these giant sequoias is Jodie Whittaker who is extraordinary in her ability to not be extraordinary.  Whittaker's gradual unfolding is handled beautifully, and to her great credit, it seems organic and credible.  This film reminded me of another wonderful ""small"" film, 10 Items or Less, with Morgan Freeman.  In both movies, people who are worlds apart have very limited encounters with each other that provide them with a rare opportunity to offer and receive profound gifts.  They are moments in time that somehow reach out of time and touch something that outlasts time.  If I were in an airport gift shop, I would buy them both for you.",1189036800,,3030,4.928994082840236
2776827,4,B000NOKFHG,"This is another movie in a genre that seems to be gaining steam in recent years.  The plot centers around a very young woman (Jodie Whittaker) and a much older man (Peter O'Toole) who share a very off-the-wall friendship.  There are many parallels between this film & other recent flicks of the same basic genre, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Translation/dp/B00011RPB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Translation</a>&nbsp;(where Bill Murray's character ""falls"" for Scarlett Johannson's character) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shopgirl/dp/B000EDWKX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shopgirl</a>&nbsp;(written by Steve Martin, where he plays the title role of a man who goes after a younger woman, portrayed by Claire Danes).

It kind of floats along, sort of dream-like.  People who need movies with lots of action, or lots of stuff going on @ once, may be rather bored by this film.

Peter O'Toole plays an actor who is way past his prime.  Once a storied Thespian, he is now relegated to roles such as that of a corpse.  He was also quite a Lady's Man in his time, but now his seductive prowess  & power over women is stale.  Physically, too, he is wearing down.  He is in need of prostrate surgery and his body is basically falling apart beneath him.

When he meets his friend's niece (played nicely by Whittaker), he suddenly finds his sexual urges and romantic passions re-awakened.  He projects & idealizes her into the image of Venus, Roman goddess of Love, as she appears in a famous painting.  Jodie Whittaker has an unconventional, demure beauty that is perfect for her role as the young siren.

The story tells of how the 2 people try to manipulate each other towards their own ends.  He wants small non-sexual favors, and in return she wants him to buy her stuff.  Out of this they somehow form a genuine (albeit awkward?) friendship.

For those who have seen LOST IN TRANSLATION and / or SHOPGIRL, those films will likely be a good indicator as to how much (or little?) you will like this movie.  One thing that must be acknowledged is that this is a little more ""extreme"" in its view of the older man / much younger girl.  O'Toole is in his Golden Years while Jodie Whittaker is literally barely out of high school.  Some may find this a bit vulger, but for those who stick around for the whole story, they will find a certain elegance in watching the Venus on the screen transforming into the vision of Venus in the painting.",1188777600,3,2729,5.465393794749403

2776829,5,B000NOKFHG,"This could have a groan to watch, even pervy (it actually is in places) but it's still an absolute gem.

While Peter O'Toole grabs the lion's share of attention, there are many other reasons why this so works. One of them is a stunning turn from Leslie Phillips who up until now has been all but a National joke in Britain (in the nicest way - he's been acting since the Fifties in light-hearted and often bawdy British comedies). The two together are never anything less than brilliant. Phillips knows he's up against real acting talent, but every time he matches it with his most brilliant and layered performance ever. And he's subtle too. Their scenes together are worth their weight in gold.

Part of the reason is the fantastically funny, observational and touching script from Hanif Kureish which should have pulled a statue. There's a scene where two nurses are chatting over Peter O'Toole - one sticking a needle in his arm in some god-forsaken National Health Service room - and they just don't see him - he might as well not be there - why - because he's old - and therefore doesn't count anymore. It immediately cuts to him in the next scene at home - head lowered - sat on the side of a bed - hurting at the realisation of his aged fate. Then he slaps his own face three times and tells himself to ""get up you old fu**er"" and get on with life! O'Toole can suggest so much with even a glance. Both scenes are crushingly sad, but say so much by using so little. It's fantastic writing.

There's another scene with Richard Griffiths (superb British actor who played Uncle Monty in Withnail & I) and Leslie Phillips; they're in a London cafe the three dotty cumudgens frequent, when Phillips bemoans the fact that his new girl lodger Jessie (played by Judie Whittaker - dubbed ""Venus"" by O'Toole after visiting the famous painting in The National Gallery) has drunk all his best booze and eaten him out of house and home. He's frantic. The two boys react - not with sympathy and tea - but by relentlessly taking the piss out of his overreaction! It's just hysterically funny, well paced and packed full of wisdoms.

Maurice's (O'Toole) reaction to Venus is entirely different. She, of course, with her short skirts, Northern accent and lip that knows no subtlety - represents life, youth, woman. And for a man who's been in love with them all from the moment he could ditch his nappy and chase them down the street - she's irresistable. Their romance at-a-distance is slowly boiled and admittedly at times, it seems highly unlikely, but they play it so well together, you believe it. There are slightly pervy moments as I said and awkward scenes where he can't help himself and gets physical, and she calls him ""forward"". But he is - as a man - dying - and he can't stand it - he has so much to give still, if only someone will stop looking at him as old, and instead see him as a viable human being. It's all beautifully handled, insightful and ballsy - because these things should be/need to be said and addressed.

The music is provided by the lovely Corrine Bailey Rae, a British soul singer (like a softer version of Tracy Chapman meets Mica Paris) - soulful songs and strumming moments pepper the nicely used London locations. Later scenes with his long-suffering wife Vanessa Redgrave are genuinely touching too - another great actress adding class to an already classy project.

There are times when O'Toole looks ill, that this maybe his last role, but then that voice comes through, or he does an ""act-or's turn"", or he smiles at Leslie Phillips and hugs him - and lifetimes of friendship come through. In another scene Phillips' character Ian says as they sip whiskey in a gentleman's club reminiscing on their pasts, ""I love this horrible place. It reminds me, of what I wanted to become."" He admires Maurice and is jealous of him, but can say it without fear, because they're real friends. Sipping whiskey and clipping toenails!

Of course the central relationship between Maurice & Jessie goes to crap and a series of events threaten to wreck it. We're not looking at traditional happy endings here, but compromises - as all living is. It ends as it began - on a beach - with the waves of the free sea lapping on the shore - fresh and untamable.

I loved this film. Please don't let the subject matter put you off.
In one particularly touching scene, O'Toole's character Maurice, quotes Shakespeare to Venus - and to finish this review - so shall I.

""So long as men shall live and eyes shall see...
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee"".

Seldom has getting older been so fresh and compellingly portrayed, from various points of view. The physical restrictions of aging are well-examined, but there's a futility, masked by lots of humor, that held my interest. Certainly, Peter O'Toole proved that he's still got the moxy and charm. He's always been a selfish, cunning old fart who always got his way, but the prospect of facing prostate cancer makes him rev up his engine to prove to himself that he's got a lot of miles to go. The wonderful Leslie Phillips (not the one you may think) came out of semi-retirement to personify the role of O'Toole's best old buddy. There's also some brief appearances by the wonderful Richard Griffiths, a sort of sense of reason among the goofy goings on. The object of this ""coming of age"" is the appearance of Phillips' young relative, whom he hopes will take care of him. Of course, young people ""know everything"", and she has different plans. Her very individualism sparks an interest in O'Toole, and here we have the scenario. Jodie Whittaker is excellent as the young, smart-mouthed tart, and O'Toole uses all ends of smarm & charm to win her over. Their scenes together are memorable. Matching O'Toole in every scene is  Vanessa Redgrave, the cast-aside wife of yore, whose dignity and resignation to her fate has left her lonely, but never bitter. Wonderful! Certainly, this small budget gem will not blow anyone away with innovations in film-making. What it has is a moving script and sensitive direction from Roger Michel. Old folks have been given respect in other films like ""Cocoon"", ""Space Cowboys"" and that hilarious film about the old guys who rob a bank (the title of which escapes me). If you ask me, there's a lot to be said about aging that has been untapped. Is it because everyone's looking for lots of explosions and super-heroes, etc? We need more films like ""Venus"", if only to examine the amazing and interesting...and FUN...stories that can be told.",1187049600,,2148,4.805405405405406

O'Toole was given an honorary Oscar in 2003, although he had written a letter to the academy saying he was ""still in the game"" and wanted more time to ""win the lovely bugger outright.""  Any thoughts that O'Toole was engaging in wishful thinking were erased when his performance in ""Venus"" earned him his eighth nomination.  Of course, O'Toole did not have the same sort of happy ending that Henry Fonda did with ""On Golden Pond,"" since Forest Whitaker won for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-King-of-Scotland/dp/B000NIVJF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last King of Scotland</a>,"" but he certainly proved that in his 70s he still has ""game.""

In Roger Michell's 2006 film, O'Toole plays Maurice, an aging actor who is still respected, at least by those who remember him.  That would not include Jessie (Jodie Whittaker), the 20-year-old daughter of the niece of Maurice's friend Ian (Leslie Phillips), another old school actor.  Jessie would like to get into modeling and Maurice arranges for her to be nude model for an art class.  But it turns out that part of Maurice's reasons for getting her this particular gig is that he would very much like to see Jessie naked.  After an operation of his prostate Maurice is impotent, but he still has an appreciation for the female form.  As he tells Jessie at one point, the most beautiful thing a man will ever see is the body of a woman.  She wonders what would be the most beautiful thing a woman ever gets to see, and Maurice's answer rings true, but is clearly beyond her ken.

This film is the story of two people who fall in love, and while we have seen May-December relationships played out before they rarely treat physical contact and nudity in this way.  Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi, best known for 1985's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Beautiful-Laundrette/dp/B00008R9KF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Beautiful Laundrette</a>, focuses not on the sex, or absence thereof, but more on the ironic transformation from a young man who was adored by many a young girl, into an old man who has found one last young girl to adore as his personal ""Venus.""  Part of it is that Jessie stands in stark contrast to Maurice's old friends and his ex-wife His Maurice banters with fellow thespian Ian (a terrific Leslie Phillips) and visits his ex-wife Valerie (Vanessa Redgrave).  After decades of banter, even of the enjoyable kind between Maurice and Ian, there is much to be said for getting to look, even if getting to touch earns you a sharp elbow in a tender spot.

But in ""Venus"" everything comes back to O'Toole's performance, which offers a wide range of emotional shadings.  Maurice is not only enamored with the crude Jessie, he is raging against the ravages of time, humiliated by his physical failings, and trying to keep together the last shreds of his dignity.  In her film debut, Whittaker responds in kind, her youth and inexperience limiting the range of her reactions.  In the final act of the film she finally gives Maurice a look at her naked breasts, but in that context it is not the exhibition that matters but the change in her voice, which speaks much more to the nature of their relationship.  I have to say that I found O'Toole's performance to be more compelling and certainly more memorable than the one that won the Oscar earlier this year, but you know full well that a movie that grossed $3.3 million dollars (most of it in the wake of O'Toole's nomination) was never going to be seen by enough voters to win.

And indeed, this movie does seem to be a living homage to a man who has given us the world, but whom we have treated so poorly in his old age.  I would hope that the full picture of the character here may be inspired by O'Toole, but not totally imitative of him.

O'Toole plays Maurice, an aged actor who has an easier time getting parts as dying (or dead) grandfathers than the kind of work in his heyday (can anyone say&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Spirits/dp/B000063JDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Spirits</a>?), but still he thinks he has a way with women, which becomes immediately apparent when he fellow aged thespian, Ian, has his niece's daughter, Jessie (played by Jodie Whittaker), come to live with to supposedly take care of him.  Turns out that Jessie is more of the object of her mother's scorn and has been sent out of her house than much of a nurse to Ian.  But she is instantly the center of Maurice's fancy.

This movie well addresses the problems and just plain creepiness of Maurice's attention over Jessie, but clearly there is something both can gain from this relationship.  Maurice, though spirited, is surrounded by reminders of his eminent death, and though Jessie is young enough to be his grandaughter, she has a painful past that could be poulticed at least a little bit by the attentions of a lustful but at least caring older man.

Their relationship, of course, has difficulties.  Maurice regularly visits his estranged wife, Valerie (played wonderfully by Vanessa Redgrave, though certainly an underutilized part), a wife he has cheated on numerously, and Jessie is a bit of an opportunist (and a heavy drinker).  In essence, this is a film about two damaged people who might be able to heal themselves with each other.  O'Toole carries this film with his energy, talent and palpable regret and strains to deal with his aged body, but the story of Jessie is also quite a drive through this film.  She is strong but scared, a girl who seems to have things under control but just as easily a wreck.  And as the movie continues, it becomes quite clear that O'Toole infuses something of himself into this role, as images of his past reinforce.

This movie should serve as a staunch reminder that great actors may fade, but that we still owe them tribute, and that they may wait in the wings and are always ready to come out and remind us that they are, indeed, great.  Director Roger Michell presents an intriguing story that is both difficult and sweet, and though it may take some predictable moves towards the end, takes on the process of identity to show us how everyone has a struggle, no matter how new or experienced they may be with the game.",1184630400,2,4200,5.998327759197324
2776844,3,B000NOKFHG,"The Gray Panthers, the alliance that advocates for the liberation of old people, should picket this movie. ""Venus"" does feature older actors in lead roles, which might be cited as an advancement of the elderly. However, all the people who are over seventy here are depicted as being profoundly and uniformly rickety. While it would be wrong to glamorize old age and gloss over the many problems attached to it - it is even worse to stereotype those over seventy as being inevitably tottering.

None of the people I know who are over seventy (or even over eighty or ninety) are as debilitated as the characters shown here, unless they are permanent residents of extended care facilities. The independently living seniors I know are generally crisply up and about.

So from the start, this movie seems to be limping painfully away from reality. First we see veteran actors Peter O'Toole and Leslie Phillips fumbling, randomly shuffling through and trading medications. That scene contains two improbabilities. First there's the improbability that two old friends in an upscale London coffee shop would be that near to collapse. Then, while seniors usually do have platoons of prescribed pills to take, I've never seen anyone randomly gulping ""Two blues for three of your reds."" However, I was willing to suspend disbelief and go along with this premise of muddled frailty - for a while.

But then when Vanessa Redgrave also comes dragging arthritically into the picture, barely able to gum her food - it really gets to be too much. The whole picture slows to a crawl. It assumes the unlikeliness of some fish suddenly tossed onto a stylish living room carpet and left to gasp for air. I felt that this picture was the warped projection of its younger producers'/director's fictions and fears about old age.

To be fair though, the principal young person in the film is also shown as an improbable person. When we first meet her, she's a totally sullen girl committed only to continuously slurping junk food. Most viewers will probably wonder how she's been able to keep her figure with this incessant gluttony, and might even go on to suspect that she has some compulsive eating disorder, such as some rare female version of Prader-Willi Syndrome, and that overcoming this affliction will become a secondary theme in the movie. The girl soon sheds these unpleasant traits though in the warm glow of O'Toole's fondly erotic attentions - and becomes a caring, attentive companion to O'Toole. Again, this is not too realistic.

There are some tender moments here. There is also some poignant insight into how important and sustaining the prospect of feminine beauty can be in a man's life. Along with the girl in the film, the viewer will probably wonder what vision of pleasure can sustain a woman through old age. But I don't think these moments of human connection are enough to elevate this into a first-rate picture.

The Director's commentary and the other extras on the DVD also fall rather flat.

It is worthwhile to see such distinguished actors performing. However ultimately, these super-stars are just reduced to being superannuated.",1183939200,,3140,4.9695238095238095

2776847,3,B000NOKFHG,"Not the death of desire, which this film tells us is ever alive. The flashing blue Lawrence-eyes are rheumy;  the always spare frame is now fragile; the striking handsomeness bears the marks of time and a life hard-lived; the once powerful voice an echo of itself.  But Peter O'Toole the great actor, is still in there, strong and vital, and he brings dignity to a very delicate piece about an old man's continuing desire for female beauty, and the life represented there, even on the precipice of eternity.  And for that, this film is worth seeing.

O'Toole's Maurice feels mortality in every breath, and the indignities and infirmities of old age are present in every waking moment. He passes the time playing corpses in TV shows, and trading pills with his ancient friends.  His has been a life lived selfishly, in service to his own pleasure, as is tellingly revealed in the very nice scene with his ex-wife, played by Vanessa Redgrave.  The old ham finds infatuation with a rather fatuous young woman and this final dance with desire will bring some insight to the object of his affection and some final reflection to the old ""player"".

This is difficult material, an old man's lust or love for a young woman, but it was presented honestly in that both parties are using the other for their own purposes, until perhaps the end.  If they are changed by one another, it is in subtle small ways, and while the ending may seem a bit too neat, the relationship limned before has been carefully constructed.

I found great care in the presentation, treading a fine line. It is a wistful film about final days and the heart's ever longing.  Or, as Peter O'Toole says, it's about a dirty old man and a (trampy) young woman.  It is both. Not for everyone, I found it worthwhile.",1183161600,8,1774,4.635782747603834
2776848,2,B000NOKFHG,"I wonder at how so many viewers heap high praise upon Peter O'Toole for his role of Maurice Russell in ""Venus"".  Depraved, dirty, and disgusting, the arthritic Maurice clings to anything that allows him to revel in his own decrepitude.  Enter the slag-heap Jessie, his ""Venus"", and grand-niece of his closest friend, Ian.

Jessie is, if possible, even more despicable than Maurice.  She mumbles incoherently in most scenes, a trait exacerbated only by her thick English-midlands accent; she also manages to masticate like a troll, food flying from her mouth every time she's attempting to feed.  Maurice, who happens upon the trampy girl when she is shoved upon her unsuspecting uncle as a would-be caretaker, wastes no time plying her with booze and baubles.

He rhapsodizes about his fame and how utterly determined he is to pursue his own hedonistic code despite soon facing the grave.  She takes advantage at every turn, landing a stint as an artists' model as the coup de grace of his favor.

A particularly horrific scene is where ""Venus"" offers Maurice a chance to bestow three osculations upon her bared shoulder.  She does this throughout the movie, proffering tasteless little fondles as payment for jewelry, fine dining, etc.  O'Toole's ghastly, grinning death's-head hovers for long moments next to the young female's nubile head -- and the resulting image is enough to have the viewer reach for the Mylanta.

Honestly -- this is hardly a triumphant or exultant film.  In the end, Maurice, who has been soundly pummeled by Jessie's young man (whom she invites to visit at Maurice's home, at which point she tells the old man to take a hike [literally] so that she and the bloke can have a poke = so classy!), rapidly deteriorates (he's been managing to do so in nature's course throughout the film in any event) and drops dead at the seashore.

And a good riddance to bad rubbish.

Poor Vanessa Redgrave is underplayed in her portrayal of Mrs. Russell, Valerie, whom Maurice had abandoned decades before, replete with their three young children under age six.  Why they've never properly divorced is confusing; why Valerie still entertains him, in the most civil and welcoming manner, is truly mystifying.  She even shows immense grace at Maurice's funeral reception, when she offers to help the useless Jessie.

  Having recently watched his performance in Lassie (also recommended), I was reminded of his versatility when I saw Venus. Instead of a dog lover, this time O'Toole plays the role of an elderly man, still searching for love and beauty. He doesn't even try to cover up his genuinely wrinkly face and allows age to work to his advantage, not always easy to pull off in a film performance.

2776850,4,B000NOKFHG,"In what feels like valedictory work, Peter O'Toole gives a remarkably nuanced performance as famous septuagenarian actor and raconteur Maurice Russell in director Roger Michell's modest 2006 character study. It's impressive when an actor of O'Toole's stature can refer back to his own illustrious career within a semi-doppelganger character without calling undue attention to it. The actor is given an uncommonly rich role thanks to Hanif Kureishi's perceptive, often trenchant script, which sets up Maurice as a man who embraces his mortality but not his withering virility. His need for female attention is palpable but does not veer too adamantly toward prurient.

Through his bosom buddy and fellow thespian Ian, Maurice meets Jessie, Ian's niece's daughter, a sullen, disrespectful girl who steals all of Ian's alcohol while she acts as his caretaker. Ian is appalled by Jessie, but Maurice is intrigued enough by the girl to help her land a job as an art class model and teach her about the arts. However, his intentions are not altogether altruistic since he takes advantage of opportunities to caress her when given permission. This is where the film does its most delicate dance, as the potentially unsavory aspects are leavened by the sheer romanticism of Maurice's overtures safely insulated by his medically-induced impotence. The story only goes astray toward the end when Jessie's thuggish boyfriend enters the picture on the fringes and catalyzes the inevitable conclusion.

Beyond O'Toole's masterful work, there are sterling performances from Leslie Phillips as the easily flustered, high-maintenance Ian and especially a vanity-free Vanessa Redgrave, who almost matches O'Toole's impact in just three telling scenes as Maurice's resigned ex-wife Valerie. With her shopworn beauty and enervated manner, she is able to convey subtle shifts between anger and affection to a man who had long ago abandoned her and their children only to forgive him for his past sins. As Jessie, Jodie Whittaker holds her own against the veteran cast, and her portrayal of the character's steely resolve minimizes the shock value of the burgeoning relationship, though I have to admit the inconsistencies in the script's view of her character are a bit jarring within the story flow.

The woman is Jessie (newcomer Jodi Whittaker), the barely-out-of-her-teens niece of a friend of Maurice's (O'Toole). Maurice's buddy, Ian (Leslie Phillips), thought his niece might help take care of him, even liven up his rather dreary and mundane life. But when Jessie turns out to be an embittered and angry young woman whose only wish is to eat and drink him out of house and home, Ian runs and hides in his bedroom.

Enter Maurice who takes an instant liking to Jessie (he calls her Venus). Sexually attracted to her yet battling prostate cancer, Maurice and Venus teach each other the wiles of their ages. Maurice is a down-and-out actor who mainly plays dead or dying characters on TV programs (""Typecast again""). But he's also a lover and a married man. Like many in the film industry, his relationship with his wife is distant; so distant, in fact, that he doesn't live with her (his wife played by the esteemed and understated Vanessa Redgrave). To battle boredom, he and his friend Ian throw their many prescriptions on tables in a game to see who can find the greatest combination of pills that'll numb them out. Enjoying the female body more than he should, Maurice entices Venus to go out with him. Being bored, she accepts.

Little does Maurice know, though, that this Venus is just as dangerous as the real goddess. Don't mess with love! She learns that her new paramour is quick to lust and gradually taunts him with her desirables. Why she does this isn't quite clear, but it appears to be a way to regain her composure she lost from a previously bad relationship (one that involved a pregnancy and her forceful mother).

Although the unusual nature of their relationship is one of the more interesting aspects, it is O'Toole who, even in his advanced age (74?), carries off the dirty old man persona with equal parts disgust and longing. Whittaker (Venus/Jessie) tries hard to keep up but fails often in believability. Her line delivery often falls flat or overly-dramatic. Rarely does she hit the middle of the road, which is where O'Toole lives and breathes.

That said, this isn't a bad film to spend a night watching. It holds more interest than most movie rental dregs currently lining your Blockbuster store. And it'll make you think about what awaits you in old age, be you a man or a woman.",1181001600,5,3170,5.169590643274854
2776852,4,B000NOKFHG,"""Venus"" is a sentimental, though unromantic, look at one man's persistent but circumscribed desire for women as he nears the end of his life. Maurice (Peter O'Toole) was a well-known actor and handsome womanizer in his younger days. Now a septuagenarian, he passes the time with his surviving friends and still manages to make a living in front of the camera. Fastidious fellow thespian Ian (Leslie Phillips) has taken in his niece's daughter Jesse (Jodie Whittaker) and is beside himself with anxiety about the young woman's uncouth manner. Maurice thrills at opportunity for young female company, though, charming and bribing Jesse into an awkward friendship.

""Venus"" is mercifully not philosophical about old age or love, and the characters aren't easy to like. But this film excels in honesty. It doesn't romanticize old age. Maurice is a man who has always loved women and now can love them only in his imagination. His attempts to impress and please Jesse in order to get the kind of attention that pubescent boys long for might seem pitiful. Jesse's teasing and manipulation may be cruel. But there is a striking frankness in Maurice's declaration that a woman's body is the most beautiful thing that most men will ever see. ""Venus"" is a portrait of a ""dirty old man"" whose desire to participate physically in life exceeds his abilities but touches the audience.

The DVD (Miramax 2007): There are 4 deleted scenes, a making-of documentary, and an audio commentary. ""Venus, A Real Work of Art"" (14 min) features interviews with director Roger Michell, writer Hanif Kureishi, and producer Kevin Loader, who talk about developing the story, while actors Peter O'Toole, Leslie Phillips, and Jodie Whittaker talk about their characters and working together. The low-key audio commentary by director Roger Michell and producer Kevin Loader addresses story, filing, some locations and sets, and miscellaneous production details.

2776853,5,B000NOKFHG,"One of the biggest travesties of 2006 is that ""Venus"" scored only one Oscar nomination; Best Actor for Peter O'Toole. O'Toole (who has never won an Oscar, but has an Honorary one) lost to Forest Whitaker for ""The Last King of Scotland."" This year reminded me of the year ""Mystic River"" came out. Sean Penn and Bill Murray (for ""Lost in Translation"") were nominated for Best Actor. Everyone knew Penn would win, but people were torn between the two. That's how I felt with O'Toole and Whitaker, even though I hadn't seen either film. Whitaker was going to win, but I wanted O'Toole to win. Now, having seen the film, I want O'Toole to win even more. And I want to go back in time and convince the Academy to give it a few more nominations, but I'll get to that in a moment. ""Venus"" seems like a romantic-comedy, but it's very offbeat. O'Toole plays an aging actor named Maurice, who spends his days joking about his imminent death with his friend Ian (Leslie Phillips). The duo know that death is near, they almost long for it, but they choose to spend their days drinking and joking. That is until Ian's niece decides to send her 20-something daughter to stay with Ian. What he's expecting is a young girl who will help him around the house, cook for him and serve him drinks. What he gets is Jessie (Josie Whittaker), a Cockney party-girl/alcoholic who lounges around the house and drinks all of Ian's alcohol. Ian avoids Jessie, but Maurice (once a womanizer) is intrigued by the young woman and begins courting her. Maybe that's not the right term, but he begins taking her to lunch and buying her stuff. She eventually begins using the fact that Maurice is fascinated with her to her advantage, but soon finds that their relationship is much deeper than that. Yeah, like I said, it's a little offbeat. Some reviews I've read have referred to the O'Toole character as a ""dirty old man."" That's pretty much what his character is and Maurice has no problem copping to that. This is not a powerhouse performance, but one of those low-key and charming performances that Bill Murray was nominated for. O'Toole is an absolute revelation here, even though he's arguably playing a version of himself. Vanessa Redgrave also shows up as his ex-wife and is quite good as well. I think the film should have been nominated for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Leslie Phillips), Best Supporting Actress (Jodie Whittaker), and Best Original Screenplay. The reason it wasn't nominated for these is because it's such a small film. O'Toole was a shoo-in and I have no doubt that many people who voted for him hadn't even seen the film. Not that he didn't deserve it, because of Forest Whitaker hadn't made ""The Last King of Scotland"" this would have definitely been Peter O'Toole's year. ""Venus"" isn't going to appeal to a massive amount of people. A Shakespeare quoting, late 70s-early 80s sex fiend of a man isn't the kind of protagonist that attracts a lot of people; But ""Venus"" is one of the best films of 2006, with some of the best performances of that year as well. It's charming, unique, poetic, and all around great. I believe it to be the 4th best film of 2006.

2776854,4,B000NOKFHG,"""Venus"" is a parable about the inevitability of time and the impermanence of love. The story is a variation on the theme of the dying man, smitten with lost youth and opportunity, which is revived----ever-so-briefly----via the persona of a beautiful young creature. Thus the aging actor Maurice--played with subtle poignancy by Peter O'Toole--who is captivated by the attractive, but rough-about-the-edges niece of another old actor and friend, is reminiscent of the aging composer Aschenbach, who yearns for the beautiful and unobtainable young Tadziu in Visconti's ""Death in Venice."" ""Venus,"" in fact, portrays the unsatisfactory scenario of what might have occurred had Aschenbach realized his relationship with Tadziu.  Like ""Venice,"" ""Venus"" connects Love with Death, who, cast in a cameo role, overtakes its protagonist on a lonely beach. Unlike ""Venice,"" however,  ""Venus"" casts no sunset glow on the death of the actor Maurice, whose exit is both  lonely and ignominious--a dirty business with a catheter tube and bag strapped to his leg.

""Venus,"" however, is laced with laughter as well as tears, as when the two once-famous thespian friends make the rounds of their old London haunts, including a church with the memorial plaques to long-dead actors, such as Laurence Harvey. When Maurice notes that the church is running out of wall space for such commemorations, his friend Ian--played with equal professionalism by Leslie Phillips--tells him wistfully that ""Ian"" is a very short name. One of the most touching lines, though, comes when the two revisit their elegant Edwardian club--apparently frequented by actors--and Ian remarks that he loves coming to the place, because it reminds him so much of what he might have been.

The acting, as is to be expected from such a cast, which includes Vanessa Redgrave as Maurice's long-neglected but still-loved wife, is superb.  Peter O'Toole has the remarkable ability to inflict a mortal wound to the heart with a mere look. The expression on his face hardly changes, but his inner passion is so heartfelt that he conveys his emotion effortlessly. O'Toole's performance demonstrates the bankruptcy of the Hollywood establishment, which has failed to acknowledge his artistry properly for these many years.",1180137600,18,2263,5.3605633802816905
2776855,5,B000NOKFHG,"And so reflects 70-something Maurice (Peter O'Toole) about the importance of beauty and searching for love as the only significant goals as life races by him.  VENUS is a small miracle of a film written by Hanif Kureishi ('My Beautiful Laundrette') about the isolation and inner devastation of growing old in today's society.  What could have been a morose, whining diatribe about the cruelties of advancing age and the manner in which we treat the elderly becomes a window into the psyche of older characters whose lives have meant something - if to no one else but themselves.

Three old thespian friends and colleagues (Maurice, Ian - Leslie Phillips and Donald - Richard Griffiths) spend their days reading obits, sharing pills and recalling the days of their acting glory.  Maurice has not given up as he still performs as old characters in films and continues his lifelong libidinous longing for beautiful females.  Ian fears death from hypertension and agrees to have his niece's daughter Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) move in to care for him.  But the coarse, crude, and rude Jessie drives Ian to distraction and Ian seeks Maurice's aid in diverting Jessie's time to activity away from her home care service.  The story thus opens the way to examine the needs and desires of both Maurice and the very young Jessie, each finding a sense of solace, friendship and a new kind of love despite their extreme age differences.  Maurice continues to visit his ex-wife Valerie (Vanessa Redgrave) whenever he needs a connection to reality: these encounters speak more about the continuity of love once splintered than in almost any prior film.

In a story that could have focused on aged lechery and youthful opportunism  this film, as directed by Roger Michell, instead elects to find the path toward beauty that underlines the needs of disparate people.  The performance by O'Toole is staggeringly superb and the remainder of this small cast (Redgrave, Griffiths, Phillips - all long admired, seasoned pros - and Whittaker, a very promising new face) is top notch.  The writing and directing and acting in this film is at the peak of excellence - there really isn't anything else.  Grady Harp, May 07",1180051200,3,2195,4.96448087431694
2776856,3,B000NOKFHG,"`Venus', the goddess of love represents one of human natures most basic emotions. For Maurice, an elderly British thespian played by legendary screen actor Peter O'Toole, the mythological figure stands for something far more interesting, temptation and rediscovery.

Charged with an incredible performance by O'Toole, the new film from `Notting Hill' and `Changing Lanes' director Roger Mitchell, is an intriguing piece of art, and like most artistic works, the subject matter in `Venus' is awfully hard to swallow. When Maurice's closest friend Ian is given the hospitable, or uncongenial, services of his grand-niece, a young teenager, the brash girl, and on the verge of coming of age, turns their lives upside-down.

While Jessie, played by Jodie Whittaker, is driving Ian up the wall, the young, British teen fascinates Maurice, and for an aging man, perhaps not in the most chaste of ways. What starts as seemingly an innocent friendship built by two unlikely individuals connecting at vastly different stages of their lives, quickly degrades into an objectionable sexual obsession.

In a way `Venus' mirrors Sofia Coppola's `Lost in Translation' in many ways. It opens with an actor, living off former glory, taking parts he doesn't really want to perform, and struggling with his flameless marriage. However the close, plutonic relationship that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson developed is replaced in `Venus' by a cold and manipulative relationship shared by O'Toole and Whittaker.

O'Toole's character wants nothing more than to worship his young temptress for the goddess he envisions her as. Being young, Whittaker's character Jessie does what any teenager would do with relentless, adoring attention, abuse it. For simple sexual acts of foreplay, like the touch of the hand or a kiss on the neck, Jessie expects Maurice to buy her materialistic possessions such as diamonds and tattoos. Not exactly a fair bargain.

Eventually this seemingly simple relationship becomes seedier, and loses all emotional resonance. While O'Toole delivers a powerful, Oscar worthy performance, using his sad blue eyes to emote his pleasure and disappointment in Jessie, even he can't save what is ultimately a detached movie.

From the look of `Venus' I would have expected the picture to have been made by a relatively inexperienced director. Mitchell, who has helmed a great deal of projects, dabbles here in the handheld movement that has been sweeping the artier, independent films these days. Sadly though, aside from a few moments, the technique doesn't necessarily enhance the film, in fact in some instances it skews the framing, making the film look somewhat amateur.

Even with the unnerving plot points there are a few moments of genuine cheer, brought to life by the performances of O'Toole and his other classic British costars Leslie Phillips and Richard Griffiths, who share some amusing scenes together at their local diner. One other memorable scene is when O'Toole, in one of his more humorously perverse moments, attempts to spy on Whittaker while her character models nude for a group of artists, let's just say the sequence ends with a bang...

2776858,5,B000NOKFHG,"The healing power of beauty is ageless.  'Venus' takes this theme all the way to the curtain call in the life of Morris Russell (Peter O'Toole).  As a famous actor at the sunset of his life and career, his memory and desire are for beauty.  This desire is rekindled when he meets his friend, Ian's, (Leslie Phillips) niece.  Jessie (Jodie Whittaker), becomes for him that Venus, the ideal of female beauty.  For the film to work and maintain its credibility, the mutual affection would have to suspend our disbelief.  At first she ignores him as a boring, old codger--to the point of rudeness.  That's realistic enough.  But she does not merely reawaken his desire for feminine beauty that was at its zenith when he was a handsome young actor, he does for Venus what she desires.  She wishes to be admired.  Added to that his wit and charm, and he's the alternative to the limitations of virile--yet callow--youth.  Besides they seldom know Shakespeare's sonnets, let alone are able to passionately quote them like he does.  Theirs is a mutual arrangement.  He spends money and time with her, and she gives him a marginal amount of space to enjoy her youthful effervescence.  Each brings a measure of sweetness the other lacks.  (""Do you believe in anything, Morris?"" she asks. ""Pleasure, I like,"" he replies, ""I like to give pleasure."")

Indeed, when she doesn't prove to be dependable, there's still much for him to lean upon.  Ian provides more than a commiserating ""Grumpier Old Men"" companionship.  They both share the rage, laughter, and angst of life's final chapters.  Their jokes make the film funny without detouring into cheap, dirty-old men routines.  The humor only brings about our sympathy.  Heartwarming and sadly funny, the friendship is as enduring as his legacy.  (When he has a prostate operation, Ian asks why he didn't tell him.  ""I hate sympathy,"" he says.  ""You wouldn't have gotten any from me,"" Ian counters.  ""I know, you're a true friend,"" Morris replies.)  Then, when Jessie isn't available, she stirs enough of his own desirability to rekindle an old flame. Valerie, played with realistic zest by Vanessa Redgrave, provides the power of love and forgiveness to ferment the mix.

Between O'Toole's Oscar nominated performance, and a story that makes the seemingly impossible real, `Venus' makes the whole exchange believable currency.  'Venus' does for romance what 'Rocky Balboa' did for boxing.  It can be said that our youth and beauty worshipping culture often misses the boat and overlooks the wisdom and experience of the aged.  `Venus' reminds us of what it is like to be articulate and romantic, a lesson sage in itself.",1173657600,32,2657,4.9457013574660635

8180258,5,B000NOKFHG,"Venus shows how the ego and imagination survive the humiliations of deteriorating physical appearance and powers. Peter O'Toole's performance as an aging former matinee idol, womanizer, and bon vivant is nothing short of astonishing. This part took courage, a trait that distinguishes O'Toole's acting from the get-go.  He shows us the breakdown of a formerly arrestingly handsome and charming leading man: Alan Swann's final hour. That O'Toole--who may be the greatest screen actor ever--never won a competitive leading role Oscar despite eight nominations is baffling. The rest of the cast, including Vanessa Redgrave, Leslie Phillips, and Richard Griffiths, playing some of those who loved and still love him, is also fine. Jodie Whittaker, as the young working class Venus of the title, is in strong company, but she holds her own. It's a painful and very beautiful film.",1504224000,,875,5.340579710144928
