This DVD would make the perfect woman, it's always there when you need it, yes! It doesn't talk unless you want it to, and if you hurt it, you can just throw it away and get a new one of the EXACT SAME THING! I'm not saying it's cool to beat woman, but DVD's sure.  I'd say keep this dvd in good condition tho, because at the rate its going now... their might not be any left!",1254873600,2,532,3.8623853211009176

He is on top of his game right now and shows no signs of failing.

Kevin's wit is in a class of its own and deserves its own shelf labeled depends required to watch. I felt like I had done 100 sit ups after wards my stomach hurt so bad from laughing. If you like Kevin or stand up you will be missing out if you do not add this DVD to your collect. As Kevin says ""What are you going to do"". Well I am going to pop this in the DVD player again because once was not enough.",1256947200,,528,3.7232142857142856
3911720,5,B002DLB1HK,"My turn, Kevin Nealon. Time for YOU to hear ME out. I'm a mother of five and grandmother of two. The ""adult"" kids move out but always manage to find their way back home. Hubby's a machinist, and tracks home bits of metal and enough grease to lube an entire fleet of clunkers, had they not all been consumed for cash. Can you even begin to imagine what my house looks like? So when you come to clean, I expect you'll not only be thorough but incredibly entertaining; and if when you're finished we can manage to find you somewhat intact within the bowels of my horrific haven, you'll emerge with enough fodder for yet another DVD. And it will likely compete heartily with ""Now Hear Me Out!"" As with this DVD, it will delight watchers with your quick wit and your ability to reach high heaven hilarity without stooping to the lacivious lows of behaving like a pretentious pig.

Since Nealon's days at SNL, he has not only fine tuned his craft, but has emerged as his own distinct voice...which is heard loud and clear and hysterically on ""Now Hear Me Out!""",1256515200,2,1054,4.461139896373057
3911721,5,B002DLB1HK,"Kein Nealon is a great sardonic wit -- comfortable with political comments and bathroom humor. If you're like me and enjoy him in Weeds, then this is a no-brainer. His stand-up is evenly paced, and there are great skits to punctuate his act. Clearly he's a comedian's comedian, 'cause folks like Gary Shandlin seem to really enjoy playing off his dry sense of humor. Very funny.",1256342400,,378,4.742424242424242

His comedy is so easy to relate to, all 5 friends who watched it with me loved it just as much. I know it hasn't been out long but I hope he's working on a second one already!

Under special features there are a backstage interview.. and optional audio commentary you can turn on.

Special appearance by Garry Shandling also.

Two thumbs up!",1256083200,,525,4.067961165048544
3911723,5,B002DLB1HK,I now have a new man in my house.  Kevin Nealon once again proves that funny is the way to help you deal with people in this world.,1255305600,,131,3.6785714285714284
3911724,4,B002DLB1HK,"Buying this DVD was the best thing for my Divorce. Kevin, you just keep getting funnier.",1255132800,,88,4.5625
3911725,5,B002DLB1HK,"Do I like this DVD?  I won't answer that. Thanks
to the compelling comic delivery on this DVD and my
caveman-brain deference to Kevin Nealon's 6' 4""
stature, I realize that I can no longer answer my
own questions--without becoming ""the guy who answers
his own questions."" So it's educational, besides
being subversively funny.

I will say that I love this DVD, and I do that only
partly because I was not foolish enough to ask if
I love it beforehand.

For all of the factors compelling me to love this
DVD, I do not think strong subliminal content is
one of them. After all, Mr. Nealon has always been
one to relate any subliminal content at audible
levels.  If he were to deliver any subliminal
content, we would hear him out on it--maybe not
out loud, but out soft.  I will admit that I don't
know why I like Shandling and Kimmel for subliminal
reasons.

This is THE Kevin Nealon DVD to buy for ladies who
are concerned about subliminal comments compounding
with tremendous height to impel them toward a love
for the man himself, something Hollywood Types
describe as the ""Brad Hall effect"".  And this is a
valid concern; apparently, Mr. Nealon is fertile,
or was before the reverse splendor of a double
colonoscopy (more on that below), and even in
captivity, tall comedians can apparently be
oversexed years beyond a triple bypass that says
""no Cialis for you"" (I would add ""you do the math"",
ladies, but as a lover of phrases, Mr. Nealon will
lovingly persecute ""the ones"" who misuse them. And
girlfriend, there you don't want to go.)

For the guys, there is the lovely Rachael Harris,
another comic actor who is simply TOO GOOD for a
network sitcom. For those of you who want to see
Allyson Hannigan in every role, first, kudos for
keeping that perviness under wraps, and second,
give Ms. Harris a good well-intentioned once-over
by buying this DVD. Those with experience in the
kitchen, which I am guessing is most of you, will
come to the realization that if Allyson Hannigan
is cider vinegar, then Ms. Harris is either an
equal part lemon or lime juice or 2 parts white
wine, which actually gives her far more range.

This DVD does not shrink from penetrating matters,
shining a stark, yet glowing, yet sometimes
sequestered, light on subjects such as colonosco-
pies.  When Nealon does his part, so to speak,
you sense that he is transcending tiers of breadth
and depth of various awarenesses of human suffering.
Before the procedure, there is not a dry eye to
be had, more as a result of the doctor's level of
compassion than of going for what would get the most
laughs.

The 72 minutes of this DVD are overstuffed with
wit and wisdom, sure, and yes, you can say the
tips for managing your life are icing on the cake
(pretty sure that phrase is safe).  But do consider
that this DVD--this Kevin Nealon DVD--will probably
save you enough money on staycation ideas to pay for
itself 3 times over.",1255046400,,2906,4.5996131528046424

Do I like this dvd?  I do.

Will I watch it again?  I will.

It includes a special guest appearance by Gary Shandling (in the men's room).  Don't get pissed off... if Amazon runs out of this brilliant - glowing dvd.

""What are you gonna do?"" ...  ""What are you gonna do?""  ... buy it now and GLOW!

72  nonstop glowing minutes of Kevin Nealon's comedy hit dvd ""NOW HEAR ME OUT"", will leave you GLOWING  from happiness.  After watching this dvd, my face is glowing red.  This dvd radiates and glows with colors too!

This dvd, ""NOW HEAR ME OUT"" is better than a sex video ... with Jimmy Kimmel.  What the Nealon.

You cannot win (glow) if you don't play ... ( this dvd).  Kevin will clean up my house and leave it glowing.  Kevin, does neighbor Kena K. (Rachael Harris) work part time for Merry Maids?  If she does, I don't need her help.  I'm very low on liquor.  I need to save money for the Indian Casino.  Ka Ching!  What the Nealon.

3911732,5,B002DLB1HK,I have been a Kevin Nealon fan it seems like forever...maybe just for a little while. I saw an interview that he did on Ellen & he was talking about the birth of his son. I kept rewinding the DVR because I was laughing and crying so hard that I could not hear what else he was saying. I had to do the exact same thing with Now Hear Me Out! Kevin is hillarious and he knows it. You can't go wrong with the DVD...no matter how many times you watch it...101 times. Thanks for the laughs Kevin....EVERYONE - tell your friends to tell their friends. That is what I have done!,1254873600,,570,4.098214285714286

3911738,5,B002DLB1HK,"ATTENTION CONTEST ENTRANTS!! For those of you submitting reviews - be sure to read the official rules here:
[...]

As for the DVD itself - what I love about Kevin Nealon and this special in particular, is that he can be funny without being crass. Some might find that odd given his often obscene character: Doug Wilson on ""Weeds"". Butwhile his ""Weeds"" persona is hilariously funny in its own right - it seems to be far from Kevin's true comedic talent.

With his decades in the business its no surprise that he's a real stand-up comedy pro. He drops dry, comedic, one-line, non-sequiturs with complete ease. And his stage persona is immediately likable, he's the kind of guy you just wanna sit and have lunch with.

It's easy to go blue and curse for laughs... thankfully Kevin Nealon doesn't need to go there. So give him a shot and Hear Him Out already!",1254873600,4,855,4.57516339869281

8365410,5,B002DLB1HK,"Kevin Nealon is the king of the call back.  The audio commentary doubles the length of enjoyable listening time as well.  It's basically Kevin Nealon talking about the thingy and throwing a few more jokes in there.

Amy Schumer must have enjoyed it quite a bit, too, as she recycled a lot of these jokes on her album ""Cutting.""  She's an attractive, vulgar female though.  She probably figures no one's going to watch her and Kevin Nealon, so it's a safe person to 'borrow' jokes from.",1426896000,,485,4.593023255813954

8365414,1,B002DLB1HK,"As a fan of Kevin Nealon's work on SNL and Weeds, I was absolutely stunned by the shear awfulness of his first stand-up special. It's not just the writing thats terrible and unfunny, but also his incredibly bad delivery. He's awkward (in a bad way) and uneasy throughout the special and lacks any of the character traits he expresses in his acting. This is not so much a stand up special as it is a list of talking points which Kevin fails to develop into humor. Watching the first five minutes it became clear to me that Kevin Nealon only got a special because of his work on Weeds, he has no place in stand-up. I beg everyone who enjoys Kevin's work on SNL and Weeds on avoid this special!! It will seriously erode any respect and admiration you have for the man. It's clear after watching this that Kevin Nealon is not so much a funny person as he is a funny actor. Stick to acting, Kevin, please.",1296864000,2,900,4.331360946745562
