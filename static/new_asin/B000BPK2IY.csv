2434998,5,B000BPK2IY,"Half Light:

Rachel Carlson is a successful mystery author living in London with her young son and her husband.  Shortly after the movie starts, Rachel's son asks her to go outside and play with him, and she says she will, but she needs a few minutes.  A few minutes pass, and then she moves on to making dinner, never going outside to play with her son.  When she finally goes out to tell him dinner is ready, she finds he has drowned in the waterway that runs parallel to their home.

To escape the reminders of her son's death, and in hopes of being able to break her case of writers block, Rachel relocates to a secluded cottage on the coast that her best friend found for.  There is a lighthouse on an island not far off the coast and Rachel soon makes her way out to it in hopes of finding information that will help her with her book.  Once she is there, she finds that is inhabited by a young man, Angus, whose family has operated the lighthouse for generations.  They become friends and spend a lot of time together as he explains to her the history of the lighthouse and the island, and Rachel eventually falls in love with him.

What follows is the slow reveal of the truth behind all that Rachel has been experiencing since the death of her son.  I don't want to give away anything that will take away from the suspense of this movie, so this is where the description ends.

Overall, I thought the story was very original and I really liked it.  It has several elements, including a love story that is so well written, it leaves you hoping for a happy ending.  At least, it left me hoping for a happy ending!

I had not seen any promotion for this movie whatsoever before it was recommended to me by my sister.  I didn't even know Demi Moore still made movies!  Anyway, I'm glad I spent the money to rent it, and I now plan to buy it.  I recommend it to anyone who loves suspense movies.  You won't be disappointed!",1139184000,5,1927,4.2908587257617725
2434999,5,B000BPK2IY,"Being a writer, this movie description caught my interest. The best part is, it kept it. Though I felt the death scene with her child could've been a little more emotional (being a mother, I didn't think it had enough feeling), the tension certainly picked up and kept me on a tightrope. I like a movie that is heavier on the suspense than the gore, and this didn't disappoint. Highly entertaining.

2435000,5,B000BPK2IY,"Very good movie, with a nice, believable twist at the end. Part of what kept my complete interest was the absolutely beautiful scenery,

One of the better movies to come out.",1139097600,,174,4.612903225806452
2435001,4,B000BPK2IY,"It's ironic that this movie gives Demi Moore one of her best roles since GHOST, and this is  ghost story of a whole different color.  Set in Scotland but filmed in England and Wales, the movie tells the story of successful mystery novelist Rachel Carlson(Moore) who has to deal with the tragic death of her young son by drowning.  The tragedy takes a toll on her marriage to her struggling author husband (he compares them to Stephen and Tabitha King), and she files for divorce and at the behest of her best friend (Kate Isitt), she finds a reclusive village where she hopes to finish her novel.  There she meets a strange psychic who tells her that her dead son is with her and trying to protect her; she also stumbles upon the handsome keeper of the lighthouse on an island not far from her cottage.  Hans Matheson plays Angus with a smooth edge of melancholy and mystery, and they soon fall in love.

From there the movie takes a dark twist and nothing is quite as it seems.  Culminating in a chilling finale, HALF LIGHT is a modern day ghost story which is both creepy and poignant.  The scenery is lovely and it has a haunting musical score.",1138924800,4,1147,4.454545454545454
2435002,5,B000BPK2IY,"Moore's bone-chilling performance in this spooky psych-thriller has you on the edge of your couch from start to finish. The story's clever twists and turns kept me intrigued throughout, not to mention the eye-candy shots of the Scottish countryside. A definite must-rent.",1138924800,3,271,5.476190476190476
2435003,5,B000BPK2IY,"My wife and I saw Half Light on the shelf at a local video rental store and decided to take a chance on it. We'd never heard of it (which surprised us since we're usually pretty hip to what movies come out at the theatre), but the description on the back of the DVD box intrigued us.

We loved it so much that, when it was over, we immediately ordered a copy from Amazon!

Half Light features stunning cinematography and a breathtaking soundtrack, full of Celtic instruments and delicate passages of music that -- combined with the images on the screen -- completely captivated us. We couldn't take our eyes off the movie. In fact, we kept telling each other, ""Boy, wouldn't it be great to live there! What a beautiful location!""

I guessed what was going on about half way through the movie, but that didn't detract from the suspense we felt throughout the entire movie -- real, actual scares and not cheap shots with sound effects or someone coming up behind the actor on screen and grabbing his/her shoulder.

I love a good spooky movie. But so few are made these days. Either the CGI monsters are so goofy that they're laughable, or the writing is pedantic and stupid, or the premise is half-baked, or all the actors looks like they stepped out of TV show The OC, as vapid as any human beings can possibly be.

Half Light delivered the goods, never once disappointing us. The acting was first-rate (especially the Gaelic locals). The cinematography was nothing short of gorgeous. The soundtrack is something I hope exists because we'd love to own it. And the story itself was believable. We couldn't have asked for more from a movie and, in fact, were totally blown away by Half Light because we didn't expect much at all.

I have no idea why Half Light seems to have gone straight to DVD. It's easily one of the best movies we've seen in years.

I highly recommend Half Light.",1138579200,29,1881,4.547337278106509
2435004,4,B000BPK2IY,"I believe Demi Moore is an outstanding actor and she didn't disappoint in this movie in her performance. She plays an author in this movie who has to endure the death of her son. At first I thought her son was murdered but it turns out that was not the case and we find Demi hidding herself at a secluded ocean front home desperately tring to regain some reason for living.  It is during this time she sees visions of her son, finds messages from him and falls in love with the keeper of the lighthouse, who truly is not who you think he is.

For a little while you may feel this movie is moving way too slow, but it is building up to a very suspenseful conclusion and one that will surprise you. Suspense, action, romance and a 'never saw it coming,' conclusion awaits you in this movie and is certainly worth your time.",1138233600,87,821,4.256410256410256
2435005,5,B000BPK2IY,"As a fan of Demi Moore, I was very interested in seeing this film. Moore hasn't made many movies since the '90s. After ""GI Jane"" and ""Striptease,"" she retired from her career for a few years to raise her children. She only appeared in two films, the weak independent film ""Passion of Mind"" and ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.""  From 1997-2005 is a long time to wait for a new Demi Moore starring vehicle, which is why I was so anxious to see ""Half Light.""

It is disappointing that there was no promotion whatsoever in the U.S. for this film. After seeing the film on DVD, I'm also incredibly disappointed it wasn't given a chance in theaters. Demi Moore needs a comeback. She is only 43, still in her prime, and constantly in the limelight due to her high-profile marriage to Ashton Kutcher.  Obviously, she is still very famous, so why couldn't a Demi Moore film such as ""Half Light"" fare incredibly well in theaters?  Take Julianne Moore, who is Demi Moore's age, in ""The Forgotten,"" for example.  That was a much weaker film than ""Half Light,"" but it performed reasonably well at the box office.

I just don't think the executives in charge were willing to give Demi a chance, and that is a shame for a number of reasons. ""Half Light"" is an excellent thriller--full of suspense, beautiful scenery, score, and a luminous, emotionally-charged performance by Demi. It's probably her best performance. I admit I am a fan of the actress, so perhaps I am slightly biased, but I admit not all of her work was good. I still think Hester Prynne in ""The Scarlet Letter"" was her best role, ""Indecent Proposal"" was her best film, and now I know her very best performance was in ""Half Light.""  You could compare her performance in this film to any other major actress working today and be pleasantly surprised by her talent (and ageless beauty)!

The story itself is wondrous, mysterious, creepy, and romantic. It has it all. There is a love story, an emotional drama, as well as a thriller all mixed into the plot.  When a famous authoress loses her child in a drowning accident, she moves to a cabin on the coast of the ocean to get away and try to write. However, there are a lot of thrills and mysteries along the way. That is all I want to give away concerning the excellent plot. Keep in mind it is a story with a lot of subtlety and suspense instead of gore, like ""The Others.""

The best aspect of the film, and I think anyone would agree, is the love story. The screenplay and score are so good that you may have the music and dialogue in your head long after the film ends. The film belongs to Demi Moore most of all, though. Hopefully, she will someday receive credit as an actress.",1137801600,75,2685,4.506172839506172
2435015,5,B000BPK2IY,"One of my all time favorite scary movies...the scenery & fashion is to DIE for & the story, awesome. I own the DVD, but still needed to have it online to be able to watch  it whenever I want. Sooooooo Gooooood!",1477526400,,210,4.121951219512195

And I never regret that I watched the movie Half Light! So, Demi Moore is played the role of a well-known writer of novels. She comes to one of the British Isles in order to recover from the tragic death of her son. It seems that the sea and the quiet environment will help her mentally recover and return to the world of writers. Moreover, it is tied affair with the local lighthouse Keeper. But is it all perfect? Her character's too late start to understand that, instead of heaven, she goes to hell. And then comes the game of survival. This is a wonderful movie - Thriller!",1446249600,,737,4.466666666666667

2435029,2,B000BPK2IY,"I found Half Light, like a few others, sitting on the dvd store shelf. I had never heard of it and wondered what Demi had been up to in recent years. All the reviews seemed to be pretty positive so why not give it a try.
This movie has all the right elements...a gorgeous and haunting landscape and a wonderful score that really sets the tone. The story is ok....but just ok. It starts out in one direction...and then takes a jog to the left and then down another road. Is it a ghost story? a love story? or something else? I won't give away any spoilers..but this movie tries to combine a few different story ideas and they just don't mesh together that well. When they do, they become way too predictable. I wanted to like this movie...but unfortunately the biggest weakness of the film seems to be with its star. Some pretty rough stuff seems to happen to Demi in the story and she seems to give all the emotional sadness of a sofa cushion. She just seems to want to hurry up and move on with the script. Her performance in the romance part of the film was on par with what I have seen of her in the past and I enjoyed it. Another actress might have saved this movie from being two stars. I'm not a Demi hater..but clearly she really didn't put much effort into this....and it showed.",1440547200,,1287,4.278688524590164

2435033,5,B000BPK2IY,"At first this movie seemed to run along the formula of the grief-stricken woman who hides herself away in an isolated place and slowly goes mad. That isn't the case. The woman, an author, loses her young son through what she perceives as her own carelessness. After much counseling and an impending divorce, she travels to hide away on the Scottish coast to finish the novel she was writing when the child died. There, she avoids writing and spends her time roaming the seacoast, taking photos of the horses there, and meeting and falling in love with Angus McCullough, keeper of the lighthouse on a nearby island. She also has several visions of her son who attempts to kill her each time she sees him while she convinces herself they are merely nightmares. When she invites Angus to a part given by the villagers and he doesn't show up, she learns that the lighthouse has been empty because Angus died seven years before. That's twist #1 which makes this story stray from the usual outline.  Twists #2 and 3 soon follow and the story turns into something else other than the story of a woman slowly going insane with grief.

Shot in Cornwall, there are some breathtaking scenes  of the wild and dangerous seacoast with waves striking rocks and shooting feet of spray into the air, horses galloping along the beach, the lighthouse sending its rays across the water into the night...Demi Moore carries most of the movie and it's a definite suspenseful and beautifully-photographed tale.",1435104000,,1486,4.796875
2435034,5,B000BPK2IY,"This movie is awesome. I love it. I think most old movies are the best than the new one. This is a psychological drama about a mother/writer who just loss her son. The people she trusted created this plot to make her life complicated ( to give her psychological distress because of fame, money, greed, & deceit). You are all alone and no one believes you- its what they want for everything to fall apart and to come out as suicide; Silent murder plot. (Everything is not what it seems). I never see the movie unchained melody which was also cast by Demi Moore (I am not a big fan of romantic movie except for a few love story with humor).

The scenery, music, plot, and surprise ending are the kinds of things I love in a movie. Demi Moore and Hans Matheson have great chemistry (I have been in love with Hans ever since) and there is enough romance and suspense to fill every moment with intrigue without being graphic. I would love to know who the Celtic band is who played at Mary's party, and I really need English subtitles, but this movie finds it's way into my DVD player more often than any other I own. I really enjoy getting my movies this way, and finding the ones I love that I can't find in most stores. Thank you!",1404604800,,678,4.346456692913386

Slightly less than 3 stars but I round up for good measure.",1400112000,,359,3.9583333333333335

I wasn't certain if this was going to be the typical 6th sense ghost story line that we have seen redone a countless times, however it turned out to have so many twists. I was glad they didn't make it just like any other ghost story with a child that was passed and unlike The Others, was relieved that not everyone was dead in the end. Overall would recommend and loved that this didn't have too much blood and guts and a decent general betrayal. The movie also incorporated a vice and I find that plots and stories that incorporate virtues or vices, usually have decent writers behind them.",1398902400,,623,4.522123893805309

2435149,3,B000BPK2IY,In the beginning I really thought this was going to be like an 80's Stephen King super-natural thriller.  Instead it took a turn after 20 minutes and ended up as a very predictable and largely boring rom-com without the comedy and only a hint of anything supernatural.,1398470400,,268,4.702127659574468
2435150,4,B000BPK2IY,"I was out of town when I watched this - it had me a little spooked.  The story line started out really strong, although Demi's performance was anything but stellar.  I'm not a huge fan of Demi's but I felt that she either over-acted, or didn't give enough emotion to the story at the point where she could have been emotionally stronger hence more convincing.  Some of the situations were really predictable.  I guess I was a little caught off guard when the movie was trying to draw together the loose strings to the point where at least I could sleep without the light on. :)  It was entertaining but the acting was a little flat.",1398297600,,632,4.413793103448276

2435156,5,B000BPK2IY,Haunting tale from the Emerald Island. The scenery was so compelling it is almost a character in and of itself and would be worth watching a 2 stars movie for it alone. But add to it a super-natural tale that holds you to the end. Don't miss it!,1396569600,,245,4.125
2435157,2,B000BPK2IY,"I love psychological thrillers, I love supernatural thrillers, and who doesn't love a good Scottish village with a lighthouse? Not a fan of Demi Moore, who's adequate at best, but I do like Henry Ian Cusick so I figured they'd balance out. Unfortunately, it's just Demi for about 80% of the movie.

The basic story wasn't bad, and if it had had tighter pacing and better dialogue it probably would have been pretty good. As it was, though, it was slow, predictable, and boring. Like some other reviewers, I was just barely interested enough to watch the whole movie, but at every turn I saw the ""twists"" coming, and there wasn't a single surprise. And as some other reviewers have noted, there were a number of times suspension of disbelief was severely stretched in order to provide a set-up for something later (who would take a jarful of refrigerator magnets to a cottage? how could ""Patrick"" have possibly emptied that entire lighthouse and made it look un-lived-in, in a single afternoon?), which made it impossible for me to stay invested.

The really annoying thing is that all of that stuff could have been handled in a way that *worked*, and could have resulted in an engrossing movie.

One final question: why was there such a big deal made about the cross on the chapel when nothing ever came of it?",1396396800,,1310,4.6869565217391305

The rugged coastline ocean scenes, lighthouse, etc. were spectacular.

I mean, this character played a direct role in his death not only by leaving the gate unlocked but by not following on a promise to play with him.  I think her natural response would be tremendous guilt.  The fact that she was trying to finish writing the book that was the initial source of distraction that led to her child's death, well, it was all unbelievable or she was just pretty detached.  Patrick, the love interest was good in his role.  The ""friend"" and husband were completely boring and transparent.  The scenery was gorgeous and I loved the sense of community shown.

Moore is quite believable and engaging as a novelist and mother grieving the death of her son (for which she feels responsible) who decides to take a break in the quiet of coastal Ireland to try and find peace while she finishes her latest book.  The ensuing plot, with ghostly apparitions and a dastardly plan to destroy her sanity, is hard to walk away from.  I honestly thought this was some of Moore's greatest acting.",1371686400,,650,4.4

I am not a huge fan of Demi Moore, so I almost passed on this one, but she gives a moving performance as a brilliant mystery author whose life is about to crash around her.  Though success in publishing sees her rich and with accolades most authors can only dream of, she is saddled with a distant, unimaginative writer husband, who collects rejection slips and secretly seethes over his wife's meteoric achievements.  The simple accident of not locking a gate results in the death of her small son.  Faced with that crippling devastation, she retreats alone to an isolated Scottish isle, where she hopes to recover from her grief, and finish her four-million-dollar advance novel.

Once there, she begins to see the ghost of her son.  Is her mind cracking under the grief, the guilt?  Or could it be as the local medium reveals that the ghost-child is trying to warn her of a great danger near her?  When she meets the charming lighthouse keeper, Angus, life starts to come around.  No sooner than she feels hope that life is worth living again, things begin to quickly unravel.  The villagers swear Angus died seven years ago after murdering his wife and her lover, and then jumped from the lighthouse himself.  Demi doesn't believe them, doesn't want to accept her mind could be creating these sightings.  But what other explanation is there?  In the Henry James style of are the ghosts real or in her mind, the viewer follows Demi through the spiraling battle to figure out what is real and what is not.  It's a deft race to unravel the riddle before it's too late.

It bit transparent in a couple places and a minor plot hole here or there are easily overlooked in this good popcorn thriller.",1360195200,,1881,4.762345679012346
2435246,2,B000BPK2IY,"I watched this on streaming for free.  If I had paid money for it, I would be really unhappy.  In short, it is not intriguing enough to be a mystery and not thrilling enough to be a thriller, to paraphrase an actual line from the opening scene.  The story is not all that compelling, the acting is not all that great, and the ""twist"" is not particularly shocking or unique.  Most of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes.  The primary saving grace is the scenery.  The coast of Scotland looks amazing.  And I enjoyed the score.  That was about it.  This is certainly not the worst ghost story that I have ever seen, but it it is not worth the time.",1358208000,2,657,4.408333333333333
2435247,5,B000BPK2IY,The story line draws you into the movie right from the start. You follow along as if you are in the heroine's shoes and mind. Demi Moore is superb in this role. I will not give away the plot here and don't spoil it for yourself by trying to find out what the plot is before watching it. The filmography is excellent; you feel like you are there. You may find yourself asking how in the world is this dramatic mystery going to end? This is a one-of-a-kind artfully suspenseful movie experience.,1357344000,,493,4.369565217391305
2435248,3,B000BPK2IY,"I watched this film last night for the first time. It reminded me of Mira Sorvino's ""The Presence"". I love movies where you see a lady going off to be by herself in some lovely, quiet, solitary home. This movie is a moody piece set in Europe, but everything is very easy to understand- the words' volume is where it should be. There's nothing worse than having overly-loud special effects while having the volume of dialogue be set too low by the mixers of the film.

The main setting of this is just breathtaking. If you're a lover of the beach, the ocean & lighthouses (as I am), you'll be thrilled to view this movie. The cottages in the film, a local bar & other buildinds look authentic & are quite picturesque. Only in one scene could I tell that there were obvious special effects at play. It mostly looked very, very real- and most likely was truly on location.

The person/people in charge of lighting & cinematography did a great job here. The film didn't have all of those overly-dark scenes so common in newer movies & very annoying when you're trying to see what's going on in the plot. I could follow this movie easily without feeling confused, and yet I was captivated enough to keep watching.

It is not Demi Moore's best performance, but she's engaging enough to help one stick with the film. She looks relatively good here- fit plus still youthful & attractive. The actor who played ""Angus"" was a real standout here. Everyone in smaller roles played their parts with quiet realism. I'm normally a person who multi-tasks when I'm watching movies on the computer but this time I wasn't tempted to turn to doing other things. That's saying a lot! No one is exactly who they seem to be AT ALL in this film. Not only was it a good ghost story which turned to very little gore for shock value, rare in this day & age, but it was also a decent thriller. There are unexpected twists in the film that actually surprised me. I've seen many a ghost, horror, mystery & thriller film, yet I still couldn't predict everything that would happen here. I often end up very disappointed in ghost story movies, but didn't feel that way this time. It seemed a little chopped, though- I actually would have liked for it to be a little longer. More scenes of Demi in her rented cottage by the sea, more time with her husband, more time hanging around with the locals. But that's probably just me!

Overall, I'd give this film three & a half stars. An even better lead actress could have put it at a four. I say that not to be mean at all or to imply she's not talented. Demi is very understated when acting & often holds back in her emotions. That works well in some films but she was a little stiff for this particular role.",1356912000,,2721,4.425149700598802
2435261,4,B000BPK2IY,"Interesting thriller. However, the suspense could have been drawn out a while longer and the ending makes you wonder what exactly was going on with regards to one character in the lighthouse without ever letting you know.

2435266,3,B000BPK2IY,"While watching films like this, I always fall into the trap of trying to figure out what's going on.  I guess that that is the writer's and director's intent, but it's distracting.  I like to be able to watch a film and be entertained, or moved.  But I really don't want to have to think too much unless the topic of the film is supposed to be thought-provoking.  ""Schindler's List"" would be not only an excellent film but also an excellent example, perhaps, of a movie where I don't mind having to think.

Well, we have a mystery here.  Is it a ghost story?  Is this a rip-off of a far better film that you've all seen (won't say what that film was, since I would be actually giving something away by not giving something away)?  Or is Demi Moore just going insane, like everyone is trying to tell her?

There is a film that, while it got mixed reviews, I believe did something like this but better:  ""The Cry of the Owl.""  The protagonist in that film doesn't know what's going on - the audience doesn't either - and everyone has to wait til the third act to find out.  But I believe the payoff simply worked better in that film than this one.

Too bad.  Ms. Moore actually gives a decent performance here, but eventually to no avail.  I'll have to give a minor pass on this one.",1353888000,,1281,4.279166666666667

2. Demi Moore is a likable actress
3. The handsome love interest was charming and adorable

2435283,4,B000BPK2IY,"The rugged locales photographed in Cornwall, England supply just the right atmosphere for this tale of a lonely writer who moves to a remote location to escape her unhappy past and has a tender relationship with the local lighthouse keeper. Their romance forms the first half of the story which comes to a halt after she makes a shocking discovery.

The troubled woman (Demi Moore in a very effective performance) finds kinship in another lost soul and this part of the film is touching and real. The script takes a different turn at this point through a series of unsettling incidents in which nothing is what it seems. Some of the twists are quite clever but somewhat predictable too for anyone who has seen a lot of ghost stories.

However, at no point does the suspense let up, so whatever flaws there are in the story are compensated by fine photography, eerily effective background score and a uniformly excellent cast.

The lighthouse keeper is played skillfully by Hans Matheson, who bears a striking resemblance to either Ewan McGregor or Richard Hart (the actor who played Lana Turner's husband in ""Green Dolphin Street""). He's a sensitive actor in a demanding role.

With just the right atmosphere for a Gothic romance of this sort, this is certainly worth a watch.",1350259200,,1276,4.839449541284404
2435284,2,B000BPK2IY,"I rented this movie expecting a ghost story.  At least, that what it starts out to be.  Unfortunately, it devolves into ""crime thriller"" with a sort of supernatural twist.

There's nothing new here for anyone who's seen more than a handful of movies with paranormal twists and murder mysteries. You'll be able to figure out the murderer within the first 15 minutes of the film.  I don't always mind if I can predict the entire plot from the get go, so long as the journey to the end is exciting.  This one isn't.  It's a VERY paint-by-numbers mystery/thriller.  All the standard and predictable devices are there.  A murder - Check!  A person in a secluded location, cut off from all possible help - Check!  Weird villagers with uncertain motives - Check!  Crazy psychic lady appearing at random times telling you you're in danger - Check!  Finding names and dates of people on tombstones in old graveyards you thought were alive but are actually dead - Check!  It goes on and on.

SPOILERS:

Even as a ""just add water"" mystery there are a few things that just didn't make sense or were completely unnecessary.

1.  Thomas' death:  I was under the impression that the dead son would be MUCH for integral to the story.  That's what's implied.  Yes, I know his death is the entire reason Rachel goes to the remote cabin...to heal and write.  After his death, he serves absolutely NO purpose in the story.  In fact, you could remove every single scene with him after the opening 10 minutes and it would NOT affect the trajectory of the story whatsoever.  You could even remove him from the whole film and give Rachel another reason to go to the cabin, even for inspiration...and the film would unfold exactly the same way.  I felt like the dead son reappearing as a ghost bit was just thrown in for ""spooky"" effect.  It only made the story drag, which could have been 20 minutes shorter without all the kid's scenes.  I know the writer intended these ghostly appearances to indicate he was trying to protect his mother from the killers, but it just didn't read that way.  She got away from the killers just fine all on her own.  The kid bit was gratuitous and unnecessary.

2.  Husband as the killer:  It was obvious from the FIRST scene with Rachel that her estranged husband was going to kill her, but the REASON was very, very formulaic.  Insurance money?!  Really?!  I saw he was the killer (in cahoots with her best friend, Sharon) immediately but I thought the motive would be something more original.  I thought he was going to kill her so that HE could claim her new manuscript for himself, publish it under his own name and no longer be a failed writer.  THAT would have been more interesting, but insurance money?!  Ugh.

3.  Strange Villagers:  WHY do the villagers speak  a nonsensical foreign language when in private or when Rachel isn't around?  This is VERY strange and never explained.  I thought they might be demons, speaking some weird form of supernatural language...but no.  They're very real people who speak some form of Tolkein-ish elvish language for NO apparent reason.  WEIRD. Just one more nonsensical bit added for ""spooky"" effect but no logical reason.

4.  Angus' Furniture:  So, Robert and Sharon were teaming up with a common thug to pretend he was Angus McCullough.  HOW on earth did they furnish the entire lighthouse with bed, table, chairs, wall hangings and tons of other furniture and then ""just remove it"" to give the appearance Rachel was hallucinating?  Did they put a Uhaul truck on a ferry boat and take it out to the lighthouse island?  How could Rachel have not seen the items being removed, as she lives DIRECTLY across from the island.  That amount of stuff couldn't be removed quickly or clandestinely.  This was just a convenient plot device used to ""keep the story moving"" but insulted the viewer's logic.

Unless you've never seen a mystery/thriller before or anything like The 6th Sense, skip this one.  It's definitely a C- movie.",1348876800,3,3982,4.701015965166909

Yep, creepy cabin, no one to hear her scream, and some lazy-eyed crazy-cat-woman psychic who talks to the dead warns her of ghosts following her around.
  But, the movie (for me and other people without an Associate Arts Degree in Film Critiqueing) has some twists and turns that keep you guessing, including some local village people who give off a Hotel California vibe, which all adds up to an intriguing movie with an ending that you probably won't expect.

I really had no idea what was going to happen.  I loved the surprise ending.  Without giving too much away, the audience is left wondering (for most of the movie) whether everything going on is spiritual (supernatural) or not.  I was pleasantly surprised that this movie is a combination of what is real and what is spiritual.

I loved how grief is treated in this.

To cope with her grieve she moves to a remote Island to learn more about Light Houses which is featured in her upcoming novel.

The publisher's description of the husband's novel is, ironically, the perfect description of the movie: not sufficiently mysterious for a mystery novel, not sufficiently thrilling for a thriller. This has been done better in other movies. There is a reason why you don't remember some of these movies when they were in the theater. As I am a member of Prime, I didn't have to pay for this movie, but it was a bit of a waste of time, but I stuck through it. You have all the usual characters in this sort of movie: a restless ghost, psychic, plotting husband, a small town, and conspiratorial whispering (in Scottish Gaelic or Scots). I would not recommend this movie unless you like beautiful scenery. I haven't been to Scotland but I've recently returned from The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. I will say that the countryside is beautiful to look at. If you like nice scenery then this might not be as much of a wast of time for you.

Personally, I have enjoyed everything Demi has done (including Bruce Willis and G.I.Jane, while maybe more mystified with the whole Ashton Kutcher thing).  Forgive me, I am rambling.

I cared about Demi's carachacter.  The loss of her son...the needing a place to get away....It all made perfect sense.  As the whole ""twisted"" mind benders started to happen, I was wholly in Demi's court hoping she'd keep it together long enough to recognize who may be and actually was perpetrating her mysery.

I mistakenly thought Demi wasn't making movies....Half Light was a pleasant surprise! I really enjoy everything Demi has done...Flawless was flawless!!! I pity the world who thinks of a star like Demi as a ""has been"" or ""less than"" star when clearly she can out act half of the ""golden girls"" in the cinema today.  PLEASE!!! Nearly fifty and smokin' hot still makes Demi bankable!!!! I believe this.

To Demi, if she ever reads these things, I offer this:  Dearest Demi....I respect you for the artist you are.  Your star still burns bright!

Yet her demons follow her there, tangling her in a web of mystery, deception and hauntings both real and supernatural. First off, it's a stunning movie to behold from purely a visual standpoint. The opening scenes in London are so magnetic, so effective in portraying the characters' sense of accomplishment and tranquility to the viewer. Yet under the surface, even then you can sense unsettling eddies and currents. And then the illusion is shattered. Subsequently, when the film moves to little Scottish seaside village of Ingonish Cove, the natural scenery is sufficient to push the breath from you. It's a darkly beautiful setting, with cold sea swells, howling winds, the quaint little village with its houses and shops, those rolling hills, jagged black rock beaches...and the lighthouse situated on a humble jut of an island just out to sea. Moore is not the best actress in the world, granted, but she plays almost everything low key here, something that really works in the movie's favor. As well, age and a Hollywood surgeon's sculpting blade have changed her appearance enough so that at times, she appears almost unrecognizable as the well-known Demi Moore of the 1980s and 90s. Again, it works to the benefit of the movie. It helps you believe in Rachel, see Rachel and empathize with her, rather than seeing the rich-and-famous movie star Demi Moore playing a role.

Half Light is haunting, no doubt about it. It conjures emotional unease and sets a foreboding tone like stormclouds gathering in a leaden sky. We see Rachel in isolation for many sequences throughout, carrying the proceedings herself, with nothing but the coldly compelling scenery to interact with. The supporting cast is few, but effective. Most notable are Hans Matheson as Angus McCulloch and James Cosmo as Finlay Murray. The movie seems a simple enough dramatic ghost story at the onset, a tragedy and a haunting, a familiar film pattern. But then more possibilities come to light, the creepiness quotient ramps up, and what we end up with is a tale with enough grim, homicidal twists and turns to be worthy of a Tales from the Crypt episode. Unfortunately, sometimes the line between dread and fright and unintentional puerile humor is breached. Examples of this are the talking child's soldier doll that's supposed to unsettle us, but instead seems overly melodramatic, even silly. Or the time Rachel wakes from a nightmare into another into another, which reminded me of a spoof of the same in An American Werewolf in London. But for the most part, it was an effectively crafted and executed tale, one that leaves the viewer's head spinning just a little at the end as you try to put the pieces together that had been collected for the last two hours. What was real, and what was imagined? Who was who, and what were their motives? Was the supernatural presence real or not? And how many possible threads and asides from the body of the film that were left hanging at the end had meanings I might've missed? Thumbs up on this one.",1253577600,,3177,4.850828729281768

Bottom line: Creepy enough to give you the willies, twisted enough to keep you interested and well executed enough to keep you from getting annoyed with cheesy sets, off character wardrobes and low grade CG.

The absolutely stunning scenery almost completely eliminates the need for CG.  Which is minimal and fairly well done. Sorry, but nobody will never beat the Americans on CG [except maybe the Japanese].

Demi's acting lacks depth as usual but don't be put off; the supporting cast is brilliant and picks right up for her.

Beautifully done on what seems to be a well-endowed budget, excellent performances by its' actors, a sound track which was originally composed for the movie by a true music composer, and an intriguing storyline, the movie is played out against the background of a Scottish fishing village with a spooky lighthouse as its' focus point.  The protagonist, Rachel Carson{played by Demi Moore} is an acclaimed and successful mystery writer who takes up residence in the seaside fishing village to attempt to undo the writer's block which was caused by the untimely and needless death of her only son.  Haunting appearances and messages left by her son, a clairvoyant woman who claims to be able to see her dead son walking behind her, and a brief love affair with the young lighthouse keeper whom the townspeople claim had died tragically seven years ago lead Rachel to the conclusion that either she is the subject of some large conspiracy or is losing her mind.

I suspended my critical faculties, regarded it as a romantic thriller and know what ? I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The plot is suffused with an elegiac feel  in keeping with a sub text of loss (and ultimately, reconciliation).  Production values are very high (apart from one sequence featuring an unconvincing panorama of a  cgi lighthouse. The actual lighthouse only has one storey. Filmed in Anglesey but set in the western highlands of Scotland using an authentic Scottish cast. The celtic influenced score greatly enhances the film, adding most effectively to the the sense of mood, menace and milieu.  Demi Moore gives a convincing central performance, Hans Matheson ably teases out the facets of his complex character/s.

The plot structure is wreathed by supernatural overtones and an air of impending threat hovers over the tale as vulnerable Rachel battles  guilt over the death of her son. But whence does the threat emanate ?
Who, or what, is behind the ghostly warnings and portents ?
Her jealous ex husband ?  the local villagers ?  the wraith of her drowned son ? the mysterious lighthouse keeper Angus, with whom she enjoys some fleeting hours of comfort ? Rachel's literary agent ?

As a mother myself I was appalled at the lack of emotion the mother (Ms. Moore) demonstrated at the loss of her only son.  And to get into a love relationship shortly thereafter?  A real mother in the same situation would be completely immobilized.  The devastation from losing a child would be heart-breaking and of long duration.  It would rule your every waking moment for years.  I felt none of this from Demi Moore's character or the movie.  In a film, it is difficult to successfully combine the plot of the loss of a child with sex and suspense.  In ""Halflight"" it certainly doesn't work.

Demi Moore is quite pretty in the film and the scenery is charming.  It's an interesting little film about intrigue, but it disappointed me on the one important level.  Because of that I found Demi Moore's character to be unsympathetic and unbelievable.

I can't even fatham the grief someone feels in loosing a 5 year old child (or any age of a child).  Then you throw in a ghost story with a murder plot and you have a great story.

2435427,4,B000BPK2IY,"This film could have been a bore due to the direct allusion, both in situations, images and dialogues, to Stephen King and Tabitha King, except that Tabitha King is the not succeeding author husband who refers himself as the victim of the Tabitha King syndrome, which makes his successful author wife the Stephen  King of the story. I will not push further the parallels and allusions because very fast the film departs from the model and finds its own pace and color, kind of a strange way of saying that great parts of it are more in black and white than in colors. The thriller is fascinating because it is treated as if it were a ghost and horror story. Of course the end is slightly disappointing because it is cool and peaceful. A punch line is missing that could let the psychic horror side of the story open. But after all it was not a horror story, just a thriller and as such it is perfect, though the final miracle is nothing but a miracle, so that after all the dead might still be alive. The very static aspect of the film is in perfect agreement with these distant provinces of England, half English and half Celtic, including some Celtic language that is not subtitled for you to have the feeling you can only have in these countries or English counties when you do not understand the local dialect. The best part of the film is the use of a quasi black and white technique for the night scenes: it is just what we need for the scenes to be alive with some deeper second meaning. Hitchcock is of course a model that is used in a few scenes too.

2435428,5,B000BPK2IY,"So frequently we go into a movie of this type hoping that its going to be a true, worthy successor to years earlier mystery suspense yarns that grab your interest and suck you into the story as though you are a fly on one of the film's walls. 9 out of 10 times, the hopeful expectations are met instead with disappointment as once again, Hollywood failed to give us the experience we longed for. Half Light is the former rather than the latter here, giving us a perfect balance of supernatural thrills versus true real world mystery. Why this film didn't get more acclaim I cannot figure, except that perhaps people as a rule have degenerated in their expectations of what a great mystery is supposed to be. I can't completely subscribe to that notion because I have to believe that moviegoers want more than Hide and Seek suspense disasters. In Half Light, demi moore plays a successful author with nothing but a positive future on the planning landscape. that vision takes a violent turn when her only son is found dead in the water near her home. Marriage in ruins, lost and despondent, she takes her agent's advice and moves to a cottage with a scenic view of a lighthouse in the distance. She meets the keeper of the lighthouse and friendship quickly blossoms into love in the passing of the next month. When her new beau doesnt show for a town celebration and she asks whether anyone has seen him, she gets a most shocking answer in return.... he's been dead 7 years. As much of a surprise as that is, the twists and turns that take place after this revelation take the viewer on a rollercoaster ride of Hitchcockian proportions. The pacing is excellent, as is the downward spiral her sanity seems to be taking as a result of her situation. When the answers start coming they don't stop, and by the end, you find yourself feeling every emotion that Demi does. Her acting is the best of her career. Dread is terrific in the finale where some spiritual manifestations are executed for psychological effect, not visual effect. The result is very satisfying for reasons I cant discuss as it would be a spoiler. take my word, Half light is a film that no mystery/suspense/thriller aficionado should miss.

2435439,4,B000BPK2IY,"HALF LIGHT is a great mix of genres, supernatural, mystery, romance, along with Demi Moore and  LOST's Desmond--Henry Ian Cusick for an entertaining ride. Demi Moore's character, Rachel Carson, has lost her five year old son, Thomas in a drowning accident. With her marriage destroyed, she goes to a remote cottage on an island that a friend has rented for her so that she can finish her book (Rachel is a best selling mystery author). Almost immediately upon arriving at the cottage, supernatural events began happening to Rachel.

As an escape, she visits the lighthouse across the bay from her cottage. There she meets the keeper, Angus and a romance soon follows. To say anymore would spoil the fun, but nothing is as it seems and Rachel's grasp on reality is fragile, at best.

HALF LIGHT is one of Demi Moore's best, yet when it was released in 2006 it sank to DVD like a rock. No fanfare. No publicity. Nothing. And that's a real shame.

2435442,4,B000BPK2IY,"HALF LIGHT (a title with a lot of meaning revealed only at the conclusion of the film!) is a fine, atmospheric, well-acted little drama that explores belief in the beyond and its impact of post-traumatic responses to death.  Written and directed by Craig Rosenberg (Hotel de Love) the story challenges the viewer to enter the strange world of afterlife and consider the fine differences between illusion and credibility.

Rachel Carson (Demi Moore in a fine performance) is a successful writer living in London with her disillusioned editor husband Brian (Henry Ian Cusick) and her young son Thomas (Beans El-Balawi).  In a freak accident Thomas drowns and Rachel is devastated, and deciding that her marriage is indeed over she moves to a little quaint Scottish island cottage where she can devote her mind to her writing. She is a loner, talking only on cell phone to her best friend Sharon (Kate Isitt) in London, until she meets her neighbors the Murrays (James Cosmo and Joanna Hole) who befriend her.  She begins to see visions of Thomas, talks to him knowing that he is just in her imagination, until she meets some townspeople who undermine her belief in departed spirits.

There is a lighthouse off the coast and Rachel boats out, meets the lighthouse keeper Angus (Hans Matheson who is remembered for his Marius in 'Les Mis&eacute;rables', as Nero in 'Imperium: Nero', and Yuri in 'Dr. Zhivago' and Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex in 'The Virgin Queen' - the latter two being TV miniseries).  Slowly the two develop an attraction and affair, only for Rachel to find out from the townsfolk that Angus has been dead for seven years! At this point the mystery takes precedence and the intricate truths of a terrifying plot unfold: the race to the ending is filled with surprises and unexpected events.

The cinematography by Ashley Rowe and the musical score by Brett Rosenberg add enormously to the mood of this piece.  HALF LIGHT is a solid movie, filled with suspense and well-written story and character development and deserves far more attention than it received in the theaters.  Demi Moore proves again that she can handle dramatic roles well and Hans Matheson is most assuredly a young actor to watch!  Grady Harp, January 07",1170201600,5,2241,4.9204244031830235

She doesn't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too. After just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in Scotland to write a new novel. Yeah, sure. That's what I would do after losing my only child. I probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so. After five minutes you don't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her. You can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen. And all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly. A guy who is alone on an island for years who doesn't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it. And who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly. A mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere.

2435446,4,B000BPK2IY,"Director Craig Rosenberg's 2nd film after the obscure ""Hotel de Love"" may not send film offers fluttering through his Hollywood window, but I enjoyed the movie.  The score was gorgeous.  I kept thinking of Simon & Garfunkel's ""Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme"" and then it'd break off into a different melody.  The scenery from its location in Wales was gorgeous.  The plot did leave a few holes for me.  I had no idea why Patrick threw himself off the lighthouse at the end.  It seemed the opposite of what he'd do or the audience would want.

Demi Moore's most famous role to me is the classic ""Ghost.""  I wasn't happy to see her as the bad woman in ""Charlie's Angels 2.""  It'll be interesting to see her as a lounge singer in the upcoming ""Bobby"" about the assassination of Robert Kennedy.  In this film, it was hard for me to totally root for her character Rachel Carlson because she kept doing things that seemed contrived by a screenwriter.  Why did she decide to make dinner when she promised her son she'd be right out to play with him?  Mothers keep promises to their kids.  Why does she seem to be going out of her mind at the beach house and then insist on returning to get her dead son's toys?  They do have mail delivery even to Cornwall.  So many of those details did irk me.  What worked well for me was the relationship between Demi and Angus.  Hans Matheson from ""Les Miserables"" & ""Deathwatch"" sold me as the romantic lead.  I thought he was too good to be true and said to my wife, ""I bet he's a ghost.""  Little did I know!  The relationship sparked between the two and seemed believable to me; although I thought we were in for trouble when he stood her up at the birthday party.

James Cosmo as the townsman Finlay Murray does an excellent job.  He seemed caring as he patiently went with Rachel out to the island.  Cosmo may best be known for ""Braveheart,"" but he also has done an excellent job as Father Christmas in the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" & Glaucus in ""Troy.""  Joanna Hole has a sympathetic cameo as Finlay's wife Mary who seems to own the inn.

Kate Isitt as Rachel's ""friend"" Sharon Winton did a good job and comfortably switched from sympathetic soulmate to betraying traitor.  Henry Ian Cusak plays Sharon's husband that breaks up with her after the death of her son.  When I saw ""The Gospel of John,"" I thought Cusak made Jesus seem a bit crazy.  I wished a bit more of that lunacy was present in Brian who seemed a bit too sane.  However, it was nice to see him eventually hanging from a hook.  Beans el-Balawi plays the drowned son Thomas.  He did a good job.

2435447,1,B000BPK2IY,"Half Light (Craig Rosenberg, 2006)

I've been following some heated debate about this flick on movie boards, and it's brought a somewhat related (if tangentially) point into focus for me: why it is that movies like Darkness, the 2002 Spanish ""thriller"" with all the suspense of a Pee Wee Herman monologue, and Haute Tension, France's painfully bad 2005 attempt at horror, come over to America and fall flat. Well, I knew the answer, but really, you're all providing me with more evidence. You've never seen a good horror film in your life, have you? Because that's really the only way I can see justifying Darkness, Haute Tension, or Half Light as marginal, much less good, movies.

Demi Moore plays Rachel Carlson, an American author living in Scotland with her husband Brian (Henry Ian Cusick) and their son Thomas (the wonderfully-named Beans el-Balawi, recently in the TV adaptation of Beneath the Skin). Thomas suffers a household accident, which leads to Rachel and Brian splitting up. Rachel's friend Sharon (Coupling's Kate Isitt) finds Sharon a lovely, secluded place on the coast to hole up and try to write (and why is it that dead kids always lead to parents going off somewhere secluded, where they're bound to be tormented by guilt?). Rachel meets a number of fine locals, including Angus McCulloch (The Mists of Avalon's Hans Matheson), keeper of an even more secluded lighthouse not far from her new place, with whom she feels an instant attraction. Despite being free of the marriage bond, Rachel's not quite sure what to make of her handsome stranger...

...and neither are we. There's obviously supposed to be chemistry between these two characters, but it's never realized. It's probably off looking for the film's suspense, which Rosenberg reminds us we're supposed to be feeling by inserting a few scenes that tread the ground of every suspense movie clich&eacute; in the entire book. Once you've figured out the movie's big twists (yes, there's more than one, handled with all the delicacy afforded to, say, a road being repaved), which you will have done less than thirty minutes into the film, Rosenberg attempts to hit you with another big twist at the end. There's only one problem-- the movie's climactic scene is so befuddling that any attempt at inserting another plot twist that leads to the film's resolution does nothing but leave the viewer confused and unsatisfied. (Go look at the film boards in various places. There is one question that crops up over and over again. It relates to the utter inability of the climax to get its point across.)

It's not often that I say Darkness is better than another horror film. After all, Darkness was about the most pointless exercise in mediocrity possible. But if you have died and gone to Hell, and you have a choice of which of the two to watch on endless loop for the rest of eternity, Darkness should be a no-brainer.

2435472,3,B000BPK2IY,"A mediocre supernatural mystery that uses recycled characters and a plot that offers no real surprises or originality. A famous author, played by Demi Moore, feels responsible for the tragic death of her only child and temporarily postpones divorce proceedings from her unsuccessful-writer husband to seek solace in a spooky, isolated beachfront cottage. While this is the last thing you would ever do in real life, it is the common premise for movies such as this. Predictably, she is haunted by threatening visitations from her dead son, mysterious and ominous noises and events, and (like any of us would do in her place) she seeks distraction in the arms of a mysterious young lighthouse keeper (surprisingly not played by Ashton Kutcher). Anyone familiar with the classic movie Gaslight will quickly see through the rather thin and derivative central plot. I have no doubt that the title, Half Light, is an homage to its superior predecessor.

On the plus side, Demi is still a beautiful woman....skinny as a rail, but a very capable actress. The scenery (apparently the coast of Wales) is utterly magnificent, as is the cinematography. This is a very well-made movie, with substantial budget and excellent production values, and it provides some thrills and chills, especially for those not acquainted with the predictable plot twists so common to movies such as this. Any seasoned mystery lover will see the ending a mile away.

Another problem common to plots such as this is that at the conclusion, with all secrets revealed, many of the events that transpired are simply too coincidental and illogical to be credible. Without revealing too much of the plot, how can the one person left alive on an island with several murdered individuals be quickly dismissed as a suspect? Since when did ""murder by ghost"" stand up in court? Did the police decide that everyone murdered themselves? And, as Roger Ebert so often asks, how can evil characters always make every right move at the right time, always knowing where to hide and exactly what to do; always benefitting from luck and coincidence....are evil characters immune to human error? And lastly, how can individuals travel substantial distances in small boats over raging, stormy seas (in a matter of minutes) and at times even be submerged under water, and then appear with dry clothes?

Quibbling aside, this is a mediocre but entertaining, well-made movie with wonderful scenery and a few creepy moments. By all means, watch it and then watch its classic predecessor, Gaslight. See which you prefer.",1152835200,4,2562,5.0663507109004735
2435473,4,B000BPK2IY,"I really loved this movie.  I watched it several months ago and enjoyed it.  The other day, however, I received an email from a company that let me know the music score was now exclusively available at iTunes.  This prompted me to both download the score and see the movie once again.

I think I enjoyed the movie even better the second time.

I rented this the first time based on the plot outline. I haven't been a Demi Moore fan since that horrid horrid movie she did a few years ago where she had two lives-- one in America, one in France.  Oh, she was just horrible in that even-more horrible movie!  I really decided then and there that I wasn't a fan and she could not act.

But, she did an excellent job in this role.

I think what makes this movie so interesting-- and even better the second time-- is that there is a real mix of supernatural phenomena combined with non-supernatural.  It can be a bit confusing at first, since the viewer is not sure if he or she is witnessing ghostly events or not.

What sets this movie apart from so many others is the ambience. Yes, it was beautifully filmed.  But, even more so, the story moved along.  There were so many things happening, so many interesting twists.  Never, however, did the movie overwhelm the senses. It was quiet, serene, peaceful, yet always moving forward. Everything worked very well together.

Finally, the cast was really first rate.  Hans Matheson was excellent.  I am looking forward to seeing him again and plan to rent Deathwatch next (he's in that).  And, the others were excellent, too.",1152662400,4,1566,4.5321428571428575
2435474,4,B000BPK2IY,"Half Light is a movie my wife would like, if I can convince her that it's not too scary for her.  She is the most timid of movie goers, and refuses to watch horror movies with me.  But Half Light is a ghost story very much in the classic sense:  there are some scares, but at the most tepid edge of today's horror.  The movie is much more about the grief of a mother (have the Kleenex box close by), and has a big love story (with running horses on a romantic beach with a lighthouse; ugh) in the middle of it.  Just the kind of thing my wife might like, when she's willing to see something on her scary side.  Unfortunately for me, this is not my kind of movie at all.

Even so, it was well made.  It was well acted.  The English locations were impressively beautiful.  The story was interesting, and had a good plot twist at the end.  Ah what the heck; I guess I liked it after all.",1152230400,2,884,4.0520231213872835
2435475,2,B000BPK2IY,This is very similiar to made-for-TV movies as shown on the Lifetime TV network. Almost every man is evil. Demi gives a wooden performance.

2435476,4,B000BPK2IY,"I rented Half Light on a whim, almost choosing to pass on the movie because Demi Moore was on the cover. I couldn't remember a Demi Moore movie I had seen that triggered a ""Demi Moore is a very good actress"" memory. For some reason I rented the movie anyway. Maybe because it was a mystery thriller and I wanted a good story, but mostly because Demi plays Rachel Carlson, a successful writer. I love to write, and enjoy stories about writers.

In any case, Half Light was very good. The acting was very, very good, and Demi Moore was superb. After seeing her performance in Half Light, I know would go out of my way to rent whatever she appears in next. Demi plays a very believable role as an author who loses her child, and possibly her mind.

Outside of Demi's role, the other actors contributed exceptional performances as well. Hans Matheson had an amazing screen presence, commanding audience attention with his role as Angus McCulloch. Look for him in future movies. His performance was one of the best I have seen on screen in a while. The supporting cast, including James Cosmo as Finley and Therese Bradley as Morag were superb as well. Therese Bradley held her own on screen, and created a very spellbinding performance. There was just something unique about her look, and something intangible but good about her acting. I hope to see her more in the future as well.

Overall, I can't remember a recent movie duo that delivered commanding performances on par with Bradley and Matheson. Kudos to the casting. I believe that without the supporting cast, Demi's wonderful performance would have only been seen in a ""Half Light."" (sorry for the pun, but it seemed appropriate)

The one flaw I found with the movie was with the staging of the plot. Without giving away spoilers, when the light is shined on what truly is happening to Rachel Carlson, my mind stepped away from the movie for several minutes, saying wait a minute, how could this have been done...?...? For this reason alone I couldn't give the movie 5 stars. Everything else about Half Light is 5 stars.

If you are looking for a good mystery thriller that is heavy on mystery and has a dash of paranormal, you can't go wrong with Half Light. And if you were like me, afraid to rent a Demi Moore movie, please reconsider. Give GI Jane one more try.

Please note that the low rating for ""must buy"" is my personal preference. I don't tend to purchase mystery thrillers.

This movie was definitely a replay TV skip mode movie.  That is, when it starts to drag, just skip 30 seconds (about 10 times).  I enjoyed the local color characters the most.  They seemed real.

2435499,3,B000BPK2IY,"While not a contender for Demi Moore's crowning achievement, HALF LIGHT is at least a nice detour for her career - taking her on the scenic Scotland route far away from mutilated CHARLIE'S ANGELS sequels and press coverage on ""scandalous"" relationships with twenty-somethings.

To escape the guilt surrounding her son's drowning, bestselling author Rachel Carlson (Moore) escapes to a picturesque Scottish seashore, seeking only the company of the ocean. As you might imagine, the cinematography is gorgeous in this respect, and creates a nice distraction in the face of a mediocre This Old Haunting. The lighthouse keeper, Angus McCulloch (Hans Matheson), provides her company and a hesitant relationship starts to bloom - until she discovers he's been dead for seven years. Ooh, spooky! This was your average ghost story plot twist, but instead of being the surprise ending this twist was introduced somewhere in the middle. It seems like the writer abandons the ghost story of Thomas (Rachel's frequent dreams, and Thomas's messages from a watery grave) in favor of Rachel's new love, only to reintroduce it in such a manner that it doesn't seem all that important anymore.

I liked the movie enough, but the twists that were introduced seemed overly contrived, a little generic, and without much suspense. Demi Moore's grief over her son didn't seem genuine; rather, it was like the memory of Thomas was a gnat in her ear that she kept brushing away while she lusted after her Scottish mystery hunk. The best that could be said about this movie is that while watching Demi traipse along the sandy shores, ride horses, and hike up verdant green cliffs, you feel as if the movie has transported you to a different world entirely - something exotic and beautiful, a place almost out of time. But if you like it as much as I did, go there yourself - don't bother watching HALF LIGHT.",1151280000,3,1883,4.936908517350158

She wasn't as emotional as some moms might be though..how's that for talking out of both sides of my mouth?

Her son dies, her marriage is failing and she goes off to the country-side to write in seclusion and get a hold on life. But this only sets the stage for what appears on the surface as only a ghost story to follow.

MY FEEDBACK:

Many reviewers keep saying this is her best role. Well, she's good and the movie shows she is more than a hard-body as were the highlights in GI-Jane and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. But come on, what happened to her role in St. Elmo's Fire?!? That is in my opinion her best role, but then I'm a bit nostalgic and I was more impressionable when I was a teenager watching that film.

All the rest of actors were also good, though we spend 98% of the movie focused on Demi, we don't get to see a range of acting from the rest of the cast.

Scenery made you want to go there and bask in the locale's beauty.

Mystery was good with some twists and turns, leaving a movie that is more than just a ghost story.

Some of the dramatic scenes that should leave me crying were somehow missing some element I'm unable to put my finger on. I don't know if it was the acting, direction, or script. But it was ok, but not the pulling on the heart strings you'd expect. I think it lacked in the screenplay. The script could have done more with playing on the protagonist's sense of if she is going crazy or not. This would have drawn us into more empathy with the character and the loss of her son.

My wife didn't like the movie as much because of the supernatural theme. It seems like such a trend now that so many movies have to focus on something beyond ""normal"" life, when normal life has enough drama in and of itself. Why are so many movies lately focused on the supernatural or super-heroes? She is just getting tired of it, and part of me doesn't blame her since here is another movie to chalk up to the Dragonfly's, Sixth Sense, Stir of Echos, etc.

But . . .if you don't mind or actually prefer the extra bit of supernatural thrown in then you'll probably like this movie even more.

It is an entertaining movie, not a bad movie in any sense. I was actually pleasantly surprised. I agree with some of the reviewers that this could have done pretty well at the box office. Its defintily worth a rental!",1149638400,,2249,4.268235294117647

But all in all, I was entertained. A couple of good ""jumps in the seat"", though otherwise not very scary. The story, anything but unique and non-original, wasn't at all that predictable at all I think. And quite clever. It's more in the filmaking of ""Half Light"" the problem lies. And makes it ""just another attempt to repeat The Sixth Sence"". Not much a comeback for Demi Moore, but no disaster neither.

My husband and I were trying to figure out why neither of us had even heard of this movie.  When was it in the theatres?  Did you see a trailer for it?  What the heck is it even about?

After watching it this afternoon, I think we have our answer.

It was fairly clear within the first five minutes that Demi Moore was contactually obligated to do this film.  Her acting, if you can call it that, was akin to Eeyore in a high school play.  She wasn't the least bit believable--and I don't think her heart was in it.

Naturally, I can't say that I blame her too much.  The writing was pathetic and over the top, and the musical score just tried way too hard.  (Be sad...this is a very emotional scene...musical swell, musical swell).

Half Light doesnt give off any engergy whatsoever it's muddled in some areas plus Demi Moore doesnt do a good job. Henry Ian Cusick is OK but he's done much better then this. It gets predictable especially towards the last half hour and the secrets and mysteries aren't that actually shocking or haunting or chilling. A big miss.

2435508,5,B000BPK2IY,"The only problem I had with Half Light is that I wanted more and more scenery. The movie is so cinematically beautiful it took my breath away and pushed me to do a Google on renting cabins on Scotland's wild coast. Only occasionally do movies do a decent job using place as a main character in the storyline. Other fairly recent movies which accomplished that mission were The Shipping News and the Chinese film, The Long Journey Home. Each of them offered artistic ""scenes"" that could be singly frozen and framed and hung up on the wall. In any event, Half Light is a grand thriller which does not use a lot of blood and gore or phoney music buildup to overcome a rotten plot full of pathetic shallow characters. Half Light builds character and the psychology of that character very well. In some ways the movie reminded me of Demi's ex, Bruce Willis' Sixth Sense. There is a feel to Half Light which had me wondering if Rachel wasn't the ghost herself as she struggled to make sense of her life without her son as well as how that loss would allow her to move on as a human being and as a writer. Half Light was a super ""ghost"" movie but it was also haunting in its use of scenery and useful silence scattered here and there, that I could watch it more than once or twice. It was fun to figure out the ""foreshadowing"" in various places in the movie. Foreshadowing which I caught almost right away included Rachel's walk past the graveyard and exchange between her and the Reverend. Other shadows of things to come: the love interest Angus, standing on the pier as Rachel motors away in her boat just before she discovers the reality of that character. Great movie.

2435519,4,B000BPK2IY,"I've never been a fan of Demi Willis-Kutcher.  (-:

Having said that,  I think my assessment of this film holds more water (no pun intended).

This film is well acted.  Demi doesn't over do it.  She is right on the mark and reacts with true realism.  Perhaps her affect is slightly altered by some obvious cosmetic surgery(ies),  but it doesn't effect the outcome at all.  Her eyes are intense and she portrays the mother with precision.  I simply feel this film is carried by her acting.  She is in 95% of this film.  The casting director,  director,  producers did well in hiring the cast.

The ""town folk"" are,  as well,  played well.  This film has a grass roots feel to it.  The settings are powerful,  without negating from the acting.  You're eyes and mind are only pulled away for a moment by the backdrops.

The writing is slightly predictable.  Yet,  the acting is contrition for that.  You'll also note the directing is very ""Taylor Hackfordish"".  I only note that as an homage.  This film is entertaining.  The way the OLD directors used to ""do it"".  It's fun and only slightly horrifying.

My ONLY complaint with this film is the soundtrack.  The train wreck of compositions are OVERTLY LOUD.  This seems to involute as the film presses on.  Yet,  in the first few scenes,  the music is out of place and annoying.

All in all this film is fun.  You may not watch this film more than once,  but you'll enjoy that one viewing.  I also think that the MPAA is way off here.  This film deserves a PG-13 rating.

Thus, both deaths may  be deliberate; 4)The ultimate baddy turns out to be a relative, business associate, and/or best friend; 5)A psychic helps to bring about a positive conclusion in both films - remember Whoopy Goldberg; 6)Supernatural forces help to bring about justice in the grand finale. In any event, HL holds your attention and plays well when it comes to the hallucinatory/reality conflict. There are indeed many loopholes. But this genre always has them While the musical score for HL is well above average, it cannot compete with the tear jerking strings courtesy of Maurice Jarre; and the love relationship between DM and Patrick Swayze in GHOST is hardly comparable to the emotional ties that are established in Half Light despite the sad and moving tragedy contained in the latter.
