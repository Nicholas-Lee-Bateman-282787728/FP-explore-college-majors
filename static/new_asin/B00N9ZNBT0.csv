6619130,4,B00N9ZNBT0,Do watch this movie. It gets better after the first ten minutes. A little deep with a great message. The end was kind of unfinished or unexpected.,1482710400,2,146,4.444444444444445
6619131,4,B00N9ZNBT0,This is the first time I have ever felt sorry for a drug dealer. I hope there is a sequel!,1482451200,,90,3.55

6619139,3,B00N9ZNBT0,It's a long movie with a good storyline but the scenes are dragged out and sometimes over dramatic. It's something to watch when nothing on t.v.,1427673600,,144,4.576923076923077
6619140,4,B00N9ZNBT0,The movie was good.,1427241600,,19,4.0
8676727,2,B00N9ZNBT0,"If the acting was as good as the camera it would've been just ok.  It went too slow, the soundtrack was annoying and just off, some of the scenes were too long and drawn out and just.........don't waste your time.  I want my two hours back.",1528761600,,240,4.195652173913044
8676728,4,B00N9ZNBT0,it was good needed more at the end---left me wanting more info  on who ordered the hit,1509148800,,86,4.0588235294117645

8676731,4,B00N9ZNBT0,"I seem to support these low budget films.  It's just another one.  The lead actors were good, others certainly are amateurs. It was alright enough to follow and make sense. There are some loopholes, but it works.",1501200000,,212,4.702702702702703

8676734,4,B00N9ZNBT0,"It's nice to see a movie that is real and believable as opposed to bigger than life over the top drama and action requiring cables and CGI.
There was nothing fake about this movie and the acting was realistic and on point.  It wasn't bad at all. I felt like a fly on the wall in a real life situation.
This movie was very good and the message was on point.

Every decision you make can potentially affect your entire future.

I Love the way they left it open ended for a possible sequel.",1498521600,,487,4.159574468085107
8676735,1,B00N9ZNBT0,"I couldn't even get to the good message that other reviewers were praising because the acting was so bad. There was probably 1000lbs of 'woman' oozing from those dresses in the opening scene. The cinematography and DVD cover are about the best things going for The Good Life. After the corny intro, I skipped through the movie. Why do  people waste time and money on these types of productions? Don't put your best foot forward if it's covered with Athlete's Foot Fungus.",1495843200,,471,4.7439024390243905
