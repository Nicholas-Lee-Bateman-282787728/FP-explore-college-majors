It's well done, it keeps the kids entertained and they get a little exercise - I can't ask for much more than that.  I'll be getting a set for my nieces next.",1355184000,,260,4.078431372549019
8550260,5,B00ADU29KG,Great fun for our kids and a perfect activity break/treat. The music is original and each exercise is just long enough to be challenging while keeping their attention.,1355184000,,167,5.0
8550261,5,B00ADU29KG,"I already have Classroom Fitness Dance and was excited to see that they came out with Cross-Training videos as well. The format is the same - 4 videos that are ten minutes each except that this time there are two different instructors. Each instructor does a warm-up and cool down, some floor work like sit-ups and push-ups and a little cardio (jumping jacks, scissors) in each video. By the end the kids are definitely out of breath! They love learning how to do push-ups, I actually paused the DVD to give them a little extra time to practice. The videos do a good job of telling the kids to just try their best and that practicing will make them better so don't get frustrated. I like that :) Overall a great fitness product for kids.",1353974400,,737,4.466666666666667
