6016215,5,B00FOAHFJK,"I have all of the Rifftrax Shorts DVDs.  This one is definitely one of my favorites.  I tend to enjoy the 70s and 80s shorts and this DVD has a lot of them and they are all great!  The two older shorts are repeats from previous DVDs, but they are good ones. In fact, the one about Parts Of Speech is my kids' favorite and they were happy to see it again.  Get this one for you and one for a friend as a gift and share the funny!",1429488000,2,428,3.7752808988764044
6016216,2,B00FOAHFJK,I thought this collection of Shorts was way below par for the Rifftrax crew. I have always been a fan of MST3K and Rifftrax shorts but this was disappointing. I have almost all the shorts ever produced by these guys and this is probably the worst. I think nostalgia prevented me from giving this 1 star. :(,1426377600,,306,4.385964912280702
6016217,5,B00FOAHFJK,"The guys from mst3k are at it again, this time with ""shorts"".  I grew up having to watch this crud, and if there had been riffers back then it sure would have made watching shorts in school fun.  This is such a hoot!",1424908800,2,216,4.0
6016218,5,B00FOAHFJK,Again another great Video! I love all the shorts and I'm never let down. I will keep buying everyone they put out.,1422921600,,114,4.2272727272727275

6016220,4,B00FOAHFJK,"The RiffTrax team is back with another batch of otherworldly shorts in ""Shorts to Astonish."" Indeed, they will astonish. These oddball instructional shorts are all peculiar, but I must admit that ""Three Magic Words"" is my hands-down favorite of the lot. Not that ""Library World"" isn't radically cool, or that ""The Parts of Speech"" isn't captivating in the extreme, but the concept of three butchers able to warp the laws of space and time while invading your personal privacy and singing earnestly about the joys of pork makes ""Three Magic Words"" rival the greatest shorts of all time on the basis of surrealism alone.

Of course Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy deliver the goods in all their shorts, but be advised that only nine of the twelve shorts included feature the traditional RiffTrax crew; the three remaining shorts, including the almost insufferable ""Boy of Mexico,"" are done by Cole Stratton and Janet Varney. It's hard to compete against MST veterans in the riffing world, and while I admire their audacity in doing so, I was not a convert to their cause.

""Shorts to Astonish"" is a bargain for the musical pork product placement alone! Get yourself a copy today.",1414800000,2,1189,4.91044776119403

6016222,5,B00FOAHFJK,"As usual, these guys deliver the goods.  There are some really strange ones on here.  Alone at home?  Learn what to do - or not.  Who needs cops?  Not the chucklehead who's dad's car was stolen.  And the police in this short?  Must be from L.A.

If the colors in Fad Diet Circus were any more faded, it would be invisible.  Of course, it was terrible, but so funny.  Watch out for the end - it just...stops.

Library World - is enough to make you want to be illiterate.  Telephone for help gives new meaning to ""I've fallen and I can't get up.""

The parts of speech is on an earlier compilation - but still fun to watch - but not pay attention - much like I did (or not do) in english class.

Three Magic Words is enough to make you scared of shopping for pork. How did all those guys get into the house?  And what if there was fire?  There must have been because the kid wears the same stupid shirt for most of the short.

Safe living at school tells you how to avoid becoming a statistic due to your own stupidity.  All the more reason to home school some kids.

There are 3 extras that are not riffed by the usual guys - but Cole Stratton and Janet Varney do a good job.  Boy of Mexico is the story of a young boy and his donkey.  Just watch, you'll understand.  Borrowed Power makes you want to make it tougher to get a drivers license.  Damn kids!

And the final one is also another repeat but with different riffers.  At Your Fingertips: Boxes, is a tale of how NOT to have your kids entertain themselves.  If any of my kids tried this stuff, I would ship them off to a wilderness camp.

Enjoy!",1409011200,11,1600,4.127035830618892
6016223,5,B00FOAHFJK,"Another great compilation of riffed shorts.  On top of the 2 hours of regular riffing, this disc also includes a small sampling of two new up-and-coming riffers on shorts of their own.  Well worth the asking price.",1388880000,2,214,4.756756756756757

8617383,5,B00FOAHFJK,"I enjoyed RiffTrax and MST3K for years, and their shorts are some of their best work.  These shorts in particular are great fun.  The part of speech film had me laughing so hard I had trouble breathing.  They are also something I can share with my family, and with TV being even more of a wasteland than normal that's an important consideration. I know these dvds were released some years ago, but it still astonishes me how cheap they are.  I bought three shorts collections for under $25, and now that I've finished them I'm on the lookout for more.",1457136000,,551,4.48
