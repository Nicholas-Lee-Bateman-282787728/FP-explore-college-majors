4714065,1,B005JZU1W8,"Why should we get excited with 2 guys running around the Country Buying Rusty Signs & other Uninteresting Articles for their Stores. This is not Antique RoadShow Quality AT ALL!! AT Least Show us how it would help us & Sell it so that we can see the Follow thru!!! there is no Follow Up with these Guys, We have 2 take their word on how much they Sold it for, THAT IS NOT EXCITING! then they go to Junk-Filled Stores & The People Don't Want 2 Sell! That Doesn't Make Sense!! Other Sellers have an Auto Grave Yard, 40 or 50 Rusty Cars that they Don't Want to Sell I Guess they have them to Just Look at for 30 years! That Does not Entertain Us!",1358812800,,643,4.070866141732283
