4042825,5,B002ZX33NQ,The key was for my husband as a gift for Christmas. His friend had one and he had commented on how much he liked it. Love the design. The key is a standout and makes it easy for him to find his house key among all the other keys that are on his key ring. Discovered that Home Depot sells the same style of key which was a good thing because they cut the one I ordered from Amazon incorrectly and had to do it over so make sure your key cutter knows what he is doing!,1390176000,4,466,3.814432989690722
4042826,4,B002ZX33NQ,I love the key but it was hard to get someone to cut the key. I had I to pay more money for Lowes to do it,1389744000,,106,2.962962962962963
4042827,5,B002ZX33NQ,"I love this product! I recently lost my front door key, and I have thousands of keys for work and home on one key chain. So I decided to change it up a bit by browsing the colorful keys and I stumbled upon this gold. It's wider than regular keys and the shape is easy to pick out of my pocket without looking. The only problem that I had was some hardware stores said they did not cut personal keys, but I found a nice hardware store in the city where they cut for free, but you can not blame the story if the key cut was not perfect.  People complement me on how great it looks, I would recommend this and buy another key!",1387497600,,623,3.984
