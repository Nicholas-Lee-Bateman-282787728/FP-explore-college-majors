653363,4,630339406X,"I saw a movie once, on video or on TV, I am not sure.  But it was kind of the same story as the movie ""Big"" with Tom Hanks.  I am looking for this movie, but I don't know the title of the movie anymore, so I was hoping by writing this review someone can tell me the title.
The movie goes like this:  A sience-kid invents this machine to make things big, like a tomato.  His friend, who wants to be big, tries out the machine, and gets big/older.  I think that he goes to school to be a teacher, but I am not sure about that.  He falls in love with a woman who is also a teacher.  The sience-kid, his friend, tries to repair the machine in a way so that he can make things small again.  When he can, the big-kid goes back into the machine, and gets to be small/a kid again.  The great part about this movie is, that it has a happy end, the woman-teacher that he has fallen in love with also goes into the machine and also comes out as a kid.  When the kid goes back to school, he feels misserable, because he misses the woman and because he has a new teacher (the woman-teacher used to be his teacher, but then it happens the ""woman-teacher"" comes walking in the classroom as a kid, and sits next to him.
If you have seen this movie or know this movie and still know the name of the movie, or who plays in it. Then please contact me at: SandraDrew7@hotmail.com Thanks!",981676800,,1367,4.048327137546468
653364,4,630339406X,"Honestly, has Tom Hanks ever been better than he was here?  Could anyone have pulled off what he accomplished?  What an extraordinary job he did of conveying childhood as an adult.  There are too many moments of brilliance (of both hilarity and poignance) in this performance to pinpoint; I'll just say instead that the shot of the boy in a man's clothes near the end brought tears to my eyes when I first saw it (not to Hanks' credit but director Penny Marshall's).
Spoiler:
I like this movie enough, though, to be disturbed by what I felt was a bit of post-production tinkering in an attempt to soften the melancholy ending.  I'm convinced that when Hanks and Perkins are walking away from the camera on the boardwalk, what we hear them say as he puts his arm around her was dubbed afterwards; it only served to assure us that she would ""be OK"" in the end.  The moment itself would have felt right played without dialogue.  Likewise, the voices of the boy and his mother in the house at the end felt a bit contrived.  And -- this is what I've heard from others as well -- the lovely shot of Perkins' car driving off into the distance over the ""School Crossing"" sign on the road should have been the fadeout; the two boys walking away together felt anticlimactic.  Whenever I watch it, I always either stop the tape or change the channel before that image appears.  It just feels better that way.",976665600,3,1397,4.490118577075099
653365,4,630339406X,"A story of a young boy who has the chance to do what most of us all wish we could do - be a grown-up for a day.  As a grown-up, you can do all sorts  of cool stuff - like go to a baseball game anytime, drink beer or even buy  playboy magazine. How fun it would be to be a grown up.
In Big we see the  real bond of two young boys and how wonderful it is to be a child and have  a best friend. It's heart-touching and lots of fun, too. Living the high  life of making toys and having secretaries takes a toll on the best of  friends. Oh how we know a busy grown-up schedule pulls us apart from the  people we love - mom, dad, friends...
Business success can beat you up,  too. Tom Hanks shows us what's really important in life and it's not the  size of your body.",967075200,,762,3.7658227848101267
653366,5,630339406X,Tom Hanks Did A Great Job On Playing Big Josh In This Movie. He Gets Out Of Bed The Next Morning And Realizes He Is Big. He Was A Little Kid Before. Then He Gets A Job At This Nice Office And Dates Some Lady. They Had Fun  Together. Also You Should Take A Look At Forrest Gump. He Also Did An  Excellent Job On Playing Forrest.,963187200,,327,3.8656716417910446
653367,5,630339406X,"Laughs,Laughs,Laughs. This is a great funny movie for almost all ages! The concept is so good, with a bonus, humor! It is about a kid that wants to be an adult so bad, that one day he wishes for it, and of course, it comes  true. Tom Hanks is wonderful, as in every movie he stars in. He has trouble  at first and hets scared, but his kid-friend helps him find a place to live  and work. He works as a toy tester at a toy invention place, which is  perfect, because he has a kids mind. It is so funny how he acts around  other adults, making them think it is too good to be true to have this guy  working for them. He then begins missing the great things about being a  kid, and wants to go back.",962064000,,696,3.9285714285714284
653368,4,630339406X,"Tom Hanks is great in this comedy. I grew up watching this movie as a child, and as each year I watched it with my family and as I matured, I found different things to laugh at and different things to understand.

653370,4,630339406X,"Penny Marshall knows comedy, and this warmly sentimental fantasy proved she could deliver hugely commercial entertainment in a delightful way.  Tom Hanks is absolute perfection as Josh, and each player succeeds brilliantly  at bringing to real, vivid and always amusing life the simple, child-like  story.  Mercedes Ruehl had one of her first big breaks here as the mom.  You will love this movie.",945734400,2,397,5.238095238095238
653371,4,630339406X,"One of the early steps on Tom Hanks's journey to the annals of the Great Actors of the 20th century, this movie was, in a word, terrific.  It had terrific acting, a terrific plot, and terrific writing... Tom Hanks is one  of our national treasures, so to speak, and his portrayal of a 30-year old  kid is dead on.

My favorite LoL scene is the part where Josh is seen eating a baby corn ala corn on the cob. Both picture and sound draw one's attention in quickly as the story moves forward because of their superb quality. Extras are numerous as well as informative since this is the 25th anniversary edition.
Big helps us look back and reminisce the days as they were in our puberty years; in my case, it's close to my heart since I grew up in the eighties. I'm glad it is now included in my blu-ray collection.",1505088000,,634,4.204918032786885

654618,3,630339406X,Tom Hanks was doing comedy's at this point in his career.  After breaking into movies after the t.v. show Bosom Buddies.  He always seemed to me like a dopey adult goofball.  He nails this movie perfectly as a kid who makes a wish to be big and wakes up overnight in an adult body.  He brings innocence to the roll.  I thought this was really the first glimpse of the serious Oscar winning actor Tom Hanks would become.  And the last time I saw this it was fun to see the actress that plays Mrs. Foreman in That '70s Show as his secretary.,1478995200,,539,4.184466019417476

It holds it's foundation as a classic, 80s movie with some iconic scenes. It also delivers a large helping of nostalgia for the attitudes and styles of that time. I'm glad I rented this to watch it again... this after seeing a 'viral' vid on YouTube of Tom Hanks doing the 'shimmy shimmy coco bop"" chant with a fan in a stairwell. That said, the movie  - like most pop 80s media - lacks substance and the plot is so thin, you can use it to protect the touch screen of your iPad.",1478131200,,586,4.051724137931035

Tom Hanks has a terrific role and portrays a kid with the right mannerisms that helps make it that much more believable. This movie is good for both kids and adults. My son didn't understand the office politics and the associated social interactions (and humor) but they aren't extensive enough for him to lose interest. It's funny how I don't think of this movie as old but my son couldn't relate to a car without power doors locks or power windows. So some of the limousine humor was lost on him. He does however want a Manhattan loft filled with toys and a coke machine. Anyhow, it's a good enjoyable movie for the entire family.",1478044800,,757,4.263888888888889

There are a few things that are odd like Hank's character working in the ""computers"" department, lots of wired phones, and the sort of creepy dramatic irony that comes with an adult woman getting turned on by a character that the audience knows to be just a boy (actually goes much farther than that but you will have to watch to see what I mean)....  But the iconic moments (chopsticks, ""I get to sleep on top,"" etc.) of the film resonated with my son just as they did with me almost 30 years ago. Is it time for a remake?

Tom Hanks plays a young man who is 12 and wishes he is big. The next morning, he wakes up and he is big - full grown! He now has to sneak out of his house and figure out where the wishing machine that he wished on the night before is. He cannot unwish without the machine. The tale takes you through his adventures over the next few months, as he becomes a toy company marketing manager and falls in love with a girl (Elizabeth Perkins) and lives on his own.
Luckily, as all good stories end, he is able to have a happy ending and go back to his life as a normal 12 year old boy.

So, I went to Amazon.com and found the least costly option that was available, and it arrived in my mail a few days after I ordered it. All I can say is thank you to the folks who sent it to me. Favorite scenes of mine from the movie (specifically, scenes that ""touch"" me emotionally) include the following. First, the scene in the hotel room where 30-year-old Josh collapses onto his bed and bursts into tears, immediately pulling the curtain down over his head for protection against his cruel surroundings and beginning to become aware of the sometimes harsh realities of living in the adult world by crying out for his mother's protection: ""Mom ... (sob, sob). Mom."" The humor is in seeing a man who is somewhere in his 30's acting like a 12-year-old boy, for the transformation was only a purely physical one, I believe. That is, Josh retained the mind, heart and soul of a 12-year-old boy, having been transformed only physically into the body of a man who is somewhere in his 30's. Examples of this type of humor include seeing 30-year-old Josh slurping at the very bottom of drink cups with a straw, trying to eke out those last few drops of the drink in typical 12-year-old fashion, and the scene in the limousine with co-worker Susan where 30-year-old Josh seemingly ignores her pleas to him that the two of them get to know each other better, Josh instead crawls around the back seat of the limousine and tests out the various gadgets. He fiddles with the two overhead light switches, flipping them on and off, he makes the ""unlock"" button on the rear passenger-side door of the limousine pop up and down with a repetitive noise that gets the attention of the limousine driver, he fiddles with a portable phone, and Susan asks him, ""You're going to call someone?"" Josh replies, ""No,"" and proceeds the fiddle with the controls on the limousine's radio, only to have Susan reprimand him by telling him not to do that. Josh eventually comes to the realization that he is not ready for the responsibilities and sophistication of being an adult, and seeks to find the fortune-teller machine, Zoltar, that changed him into an adult, in order that he can change back into his original 13-year-old self. A scene that evoked a big, heart-felt ""Awwww..."" from me was the scene where Josh, immediately after having been changed back into his 13-year-old self when Susan drops him off back at his parents' house in New Jersey, is re-united with his mother after a long absence. To see how much the two of them realize how much they really did miss each other in this final scene is VERY emotionally touching, at least I think so. I have no regrets about having purchased this item. I enjoyed the movie when I saw it in the theater, so a copy of it on video was a ""must-have"" for me!

The concept and premise of this movie is so relatable to kids today, especially if they are short for their age or simply those who wish they could grow up faster than they are.  While there is some adult humor that suggests that this movie is more for adults looking back on their childhood rather than kids looking forward to their adulthood, it really suggests to the adult world that life can be a whole lot less complicated than we actually make it.  It is worth a trip to IMDb app to see all the goofs and trivia associated with the making of this movie.

655712,2,630339406X,"It had some good and funny parts in it, but the main character, although an adult on the outside, is 12-13 and has sex with an older woman then lives with her and eventually brakes her heart when he tells her he's 13. I can't even imagine the emotional scarring this kid has, and he now has to go back to hitting on teenage girls! First he has sex and a relationship (nearly marriage it seems like) with a 20 something year old woman now he's checkin out the 13 year old girls at school...that's just weird. Plus the lady is probably totally messed up knowing she slept with a kid then drops him off at his home at the end of the movie where he turns back to a kid and waves good bye to her! I don't even know how she started liking him in the first place. I know she's trying to seduce him at first because she's a gold digger or something, but then when he's spitting up food at fancy parties (like a kid), playing with light switches and locks in a limo (like a kid), sleeps in a bunk bed and little kid pajamas (like a kid), has a house of only little kid toys that he plays with (like you'd assume a kid would choose to do if they had a house), and gives her a glow in the dark compass ring so ""she won't get lost""--not as a sweet gesture but as a literal gift--you'd think that she would think he has a mental disability and not be turned on by this and want to date him--but that's what happens! This movie seems to take the concept of the ""inocenece of children"" (how we shouldn't take life so seriously and we should have fun) and goes way too far. As someone else said, if this had been about a 12 (turning 13) year old girl who ""got big"" and had sex with a guy and was considering getting married and then is like ""Oh, actually I want to go home to my family"" so the guy drops her off at home, watches her change to a kid and waves good bye, I think we would all be disturbed.

655938,5,630339406X,"As a person who loves extras on DVDs, this product is a real winner.  It has both a Blu-ray and DVD disk.  The DVD only has a trailer as an extra as all the other bonus items are on the Blu-ray copy.  These disks come in the normal smaller Blu-Ray keepsake box and each has its slot to fit into.  I had absolutely no play issues with either disk.

The movie, of course, is wonderful.  It's a great comedy and pretty much my type of movie.  There's not much I'd change, except for a line of profanity that I never like.  Regardless, my review here is focused on the bonus material and the set itself.

The one thing I really disliked about the set up of the extras was that instead of utilizing the entire screen to show a list of the extras, there is just a small box near the bottom that had two lines only of description.  You have to use the down arrow to move from item to item and sometimes from left to right to make a selection.  This was not user friendly in my view.  Also, while they had a wonderful play all option for deleted scenes that even included the option of whether or not to include director Penny Marshall's comments, they did not include a play all button for all of the trailers and TV spots.

The rest is pretty much all good.  There are several featurettes on how the movie came to be with Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg being interviewed.  As mentioned, there are several deleted scenes, including some with the Marshall intros.  Frances Fisher is included in one of those.  There is a featurette that deals with the real life toy makers, like the ones depicted in the film.  An episode of Hollywood Backstories focused on Big is included.  There's also a short piece on a carnival that was part of the premier with Tom Hanks.

The Blu-ray disk contains both the original theatrical cut and the extended version that has all of the deleted scenes included in the movie.  In addition, there is commentary by Ross and Spielberg.  However, the commentary is not like what is normally found.  In the features, you hear a lot about audiotapes that Spielberg made while she and Ross were brainstorming and developing Big.  In the commentary, they actually play several large sections of the tapes.  Then they talk about it.  It is not a case of them watching the movie and then talking about what is happening; rather, it's the playing of the tapes and then talking about how things happened.  It's pretty fascinating if you enjoy really learning about the evolution of a project.

Finally, there are a couple of Zoltar Speaks cards included.

My only regret about the extras is that apparently Tom Hanks did not participate at all.  He's seen in vintage clips from the day, but he did not do any of the updated clips from when the disks were released.  I did enjoy seeing the two young boys featured as Josh and Billy, now grown up, in the extras.

The extras were well done and made me a happy one for adding this movie to my collection.  Even with my frustration at the special features set up and the lack of Hanks' participation, I'm still giving it 5 stars.",1454716800,4,3082,4.436720142602495

656074,5,630339406X,"A 13-yr old boy wishes he was big when hes too short for a carnival ride, is embarrassed in front of the girl of his dreams, and then his wish comes true.

A young Tom Hanks is cast perfectly to play a young teenage boy in an adult's body.  It's hilarious when he is confronted by situations that would fluster or embarrass a 13-year old.  And it's fun to see that in many ways the way he deals with things is actually more grown up than the way grown-ups act.

Imagine yourself alone in NYC, unable to go home, and needing to find a way to get along in the world.  Then one day an unexpected opportunity appears.

I suppose this could be a cautionary tale...be careful what you wish for, you just might get it!

5 stars for great casting, an ingenious storyline, and for the fact that there's not really a weak performance among the entire cast.

The biggest draw in picking up this release for me was the extended cut that is 2 hours and 10 minutes( Original Was 1 hour 44 minutes) of material that only extends the film we have grown to love and presented in 1080p. You can tell they took care with this release because the film really never looked this good and as i watched it i felt like i was seeing it all over again.

The Original packaging had a slipcover that played the piano theme from the movie when you opened the flap and latter pressing's just had the common blu-ray case with one blu-ray disc inside. I Personally like the standard cases most because when i put it with the rest of my movies it sit's flush and for someone with OCD that's just a must ;).

There are plenty of special features including the theatrical version that i will list below.

+ Deleted Scenes
+ ""Big"" Beginnings
+ Chemistry of a Classic

656415,4,630339406X,"Maybe I always read too much into what was supposed to be a fairly light 1980s movie. Everyone has been a kid and unable to do something because of their size and age and wish we were grown because grown-ups can do everything, right? Big presents the perils of wanting to grow up too soon and the dangers of thinking too much like an adult. Of course no one can avoid growing up, but it really does make one pause and consider the things that we lose as we grow up.

While its meant to be a comedy, theres an underlying darkness or melancholy that surrounds elements of this movie because Josh knows he doesnt belong in the adult world because hes 12, but yet he feels things in the adult world that cant be taken back. I prefer to think of Big as a message to never lose that childhood element of yourself that is imaginative and creative mixed with the spirit of anything is possible. All too often it vanishes with age.

656590,2,630339406X,"I really enjoyed this movie when it first came out.  I watched it again the other day with my 15 year old daughter.  She pointed something out that I had never thought about. She felt the relationship between the adult co-worker and Tom Hanks was sexual molestation.  While Tom Hanks character became ""Big"" he was still a 12 year old boy trapped in a man's body.  The co-worker who begins a romantic relationship with him and has sex with him when he turns 13...well....you get the picture.  Made me think about this movie in a whole new light and while the acting was wonderful, and Tom Hanks as usual, the plot in today's mentality is taboo.  It was considered a ""woo hoo"" type moment when his friend realizes he is with an older woman.  It's like it is his right of passage and goes to the fantasy of an older woman teaching a boy how to become a man.  Indeed he begins to ""grow up"" after his sexual awakening, wearing men's GQ clothes, becoming very business oriented, etc in a few short weeks.  Had this been about a 12 year old girl who wakes up still 12 but in a woman's body, we would immediately get skeeved out if a 30 year old man starts having sex with her, especially with it so obvious it's still a child on the inside. That plot would only appeal to perverts who get turned on at the thought of a 12 year old virgin.  We have since learned that it is sexual molestation when that is done with a boy just as much as a girl. I know the adult woman in Big was oblivious to his age and when she found out he was 12, didn't kiss him on the mouth again or have sex with him.  But it was the scenario woven into the story plot line by whoever wrote it.",1442016000,,1660,4.15625

657114,4,630339406X,"Good spin on the coming-of-age genre.  Tom Hanks gives a memorable performance as a teen in an adult body.  The concept is not a new one to entertainment but it is very nicely carried out by director Penny Marshall and the cast.  I wouldn't recommend this as a general family movie.  Some profanity and adult situations involved; maybe 12, possibly 10, years old minimum for the content.  Parents stricter than I may say it's more a movie for 14 years of age and up.  Good film that is considered an 1980's stand-out and a must-see for Hanks' fans.",1432857600,,548,4.540816326530612

657518,5,630339406X,"One of Tom Hanks funniest films from the 80's
written by Gary ross & Anne spielberg (Steven spielberg's sister)
but Directed by Penny marshall
this is Penny's 2nd film as Director, very Good Directing to

well 20th century fox have released 'BIG' as 25th Anniversary blu-ray now
a new 5.1 Master audio mix has been added to which really does boost the sound quality
20th century fox have also included 2 versions of the film now
the usual Theatrical cut 104mins & the new Extended UNRATED version which has the Deleted scenes & outtakes inserted back in
i've seen the Theatrical version so many times so i only watched the UNRATED version
to see what the extra scenes are
so the extra footage is about 20mins more inserted back in which makes the unrated cut to be 120mins including credits
some of the extra scenes were needed for the storyline & some were not necessary to put back in
but it's a matter of opinion really
you either prefer the new UNRATED cut or the usual Theatrical cut
but both versions look very sharp & clear with their new HD transfers

special features
all new extras have been added
BIG BEGININGS which is retrospective featurette with writers Anne spielberg & Gary ross & Producer Jim Brooks, 15mins
CHEMISTRY OF A CLASSIC which is another retrospective featurette
more cast & crew are interviewed this time for 24mins
Director Penny marshall, Producer Jim brooks, writer Anne spielberg
Actors Elizabeth perkins, Robert Loggia, Jon Lovitz, David moscow who played the young Josh
and Jared rushton who played Billy, Josh's best friend
Tom Hanks was not interviewed for some reason
HOLLYWOOD BACKSTORIES-BIG which is TV broadcast
another 20mins featurette on the making of the film & behind the scenes stories to
most of the cast from the previous featurette are interviewed
THE WORK OF PLAY which is 5mins featurette about General people who work for a Toy company
i couldn't see the point of it really
the only thing missing is an Audio commentary by Penny marshall but i don't think it's Necessary
Theatrical trailer, TV spots, Photo Gallery are included to

scrap the old dvd release and get this new blu-ray release
which has both versions of the film plus all the special features on 1 blu-ray Disc, incredible
5 stars i gave it for sure.",1421020800,2,2268,4.765903307888041

It's fun, creative, and reveals a lot about how we all have wants, wishes, and sometimes find it's really best to accept what is and make the best of it. It's also lets you see the silliness in jealousy, competition and judgment of others that do nothing but make the one doing the judging feel worse.  I'm sure it's not for everyone, as we are all different and that's the way we learn the most about happiness, acceptance, and how we're all in this together and more alike than different where it really matters.

I think that Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. My only complaint about this movie is that the lord God's name was taken in anger a lot in this movie, Even the f word was used, but only one time. I especially loved the part in this movie is when Josh is in the toy store and he is dancing on the big piano. I just wish there could have been a sequel. For those of you who have not seen this movie yet, Go get it and pention for ""Big 2""!!!!!!!!!!!! Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith

657930,5,630339406X,"You should know the story by now - a lonely kid dreams of skipping forward to adulthood, gets his wish and finds out it's not all he thought it would be. It's a super-simple, overdone formula that somehow works marvelously in spite of its shortcomings. As an audience, we're asked to sweep a lot under the rug while the plot runs its course, but because the production has so much heart, passion and genuine innocence, it's bafflingly easy to let go and enjoy the ride. Tom Hanks is to thank for a great big chunk of that, precisely nailing the mannerisms, facial ticks and naivete of a six-foot child playing in a grown-up's world. It's a major step forward for his career, which had been quagmired in slapstick and melodrama up to this point, and he runs away with the opportunity. The story is sweet, silly and earnest, fun as a fish-out-of-water comedy but also loaded with an armload of deeper meanings - a great reminder of how silly we act throughout our lives, both as children and as adults. It's impossible not to smile when Hanks and Robert Loggia play a duet on that giant Macy's foot-piano, even if the scene's been played to death ever since. Really, really good stuff that stands the test of time.",1405641600,,1212,4.564220183486238

While I think they enjoyed the idea of a kid becoming an adult I was personally horrified with all of these smoking going on especially by the lead female character. Additionally, at one point, kid Tom Hanks trapped in an adult body decides to get on with the lusty female business executive. At that point it was a race for the remote and fast forward button before Tom Hanks' character cops a feel. Then coming to make matters worse, the lady takes her clothes off. Yikes! Once you get past that though it's relatively fine. I guess PG back then was a lot different than PG now. I think we'll stick to Nemo for the time being.",1391472000,3,919,4.2272727272727275

It amazes me how every time I watch it, I always laugh, get emotional in parts, and feel the same way like it's the first time seeing it. Though this time around I realized some actors that were in the movie that really came a long way too, not just Tom. His love interest is one of my favorite characters from 'Weeds'.
When purchasing this bluray combo, there is two nice surprises inside, from some of the famous parts of this movie. Firstly, when you open the wrapper, this opens up to play the piano scene between Tom Hanks and Gene Hackman. That was cute and immediately brought a smile to my face.

658324,5,630339406X,"""Big"" is a fantasy comedy genre film, which stars Tom Hanks as Josh Baskin.

The narrative follows Josh, who makes a wish to an antique arcade fortune teller machine called Zoltar Speaks to go from adolescence to adulthood i.e. ""to be big."" When he wakes up the next day his transformation is a shock for him and his mother, and he leaves the family home in a hurry because his mother thinks he is a stranger. He thereafter commences his journey as an adult.

The movie takes the viewer to a place child and adolescent imaginations often ponder and get frustrated by, which is to be independent and free spirited. There are several classic scenes including the foot-operated electronic keyboard (walking piano) performance of ""Heart and Soul,"" and Josh continually finding the adult world full of tantalizing possibilities, but nevertheless often making the choices an adolescent would.

It is a fun film and the entire cast provide good entertainment, which is suitable for whole family viewing.

I begged my parents to take me to FAO Schwartz after that.

Many of the reviewers who give this movie a 1 or 2 star rating did so because they do not believe it is appropriate for their children to watch or they regret watching it with their kids.  However, most of these reviewers will say THEY watched the movie when they were children.  What is the difference between the appropriateness for you at age 8 and for your 8 year old child?

658469,4,630339406X,"I've been a fan of Tom Hanks ever since I saw Big, and I would say that it's the first Hanks performance that really made me aware that he could be more than someone who would only be remembered as a briefly popular comedic actor. Big is a comedy, but it contains plenty of scenes which rely on drama. It makes some good observations about childhood, friendship, relationships, and life itself.

Josh Baskin (Hanks) is 12, and has a crush on someone at school. Unfortunately, he has no chance because her boyfriend can drive. After a failed attempt to sit next to her on a fairground ride, Josh makes a wish on a Zoltar machine; he wants to be big. A card informs him that his wish has been granted, and he wakes up the next morning as an adult. While that sounds like utter nonsense, it provides an opportunity to show how a child in a man's body might interact with the world.

We see Josh convince his friend, Billy (Jared Rushton), that he really is who he says he is. The two form a plan to track down a Zoltar machine so that Josh can wish to return to normal. While the pair wait for the information to arrive, Josh has to support himself. He likes computer games and manages to talk his way into working as a data processor at a toy company. I guess finding a job was easier in 1988 than it is today?

The genius of the movie is in showing us how simple life can be when you're a child. Most adults become jaded when they realize the reality of working, the daily routine, and the struggle to pay for all the little luxuries that they covet. Josh attacks the world with the exuberance of a child. He does everything quickly and to the best of his ability, and his enthusiastic approach draws the attention of the Mr. MacMillan (Robert Loggia), who owns the company.

Josh is promoted fast, and is soon vice president of development. His apparent luck causes resentment among some of the employees, but Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) finds his approach attractive. The two enter into a relationship, but we can see that Josh doesn't have any idea how to behave around a woman who isn't his mother. Once again, his honest approach pays dividends, and Susan perceives his attitude as a refreshing change from the manipulative partner she last dated. In fact, his childish notions help unlock the child inside her, and she likes the feelings it evokes in her.

The movie is definitely a feel-good piece, but it's more than just fluff. If you think about some of the messages, it's telling us just to take things at face value and enjoy life. Josh succeeds because he has no ulterior motives. We are regularly reminded about the importance of friendship, and how events in our lives can sometimes threaten our relationships with established friends when we find something or someone new that we think deserves our full attention. Of course, a good friend will forgive you for such indulgences.

There have been so many movies about identity switches, and quite a few of them were made in the 80s. Big is better than all of the others because after the initial fantasy element, it contains a lot of incisive observations about human behavior. The casting elevates the movie to yet another level, and it's one I return to every couple of years.

The story was written by Gary Ross, who had a hand in the writing of Seabiscuit, Pleasantville, and The Hunger Games. This is easily his best early effort and it deserves your time. The Blu-ray includes an extended cut, which adds 26 minutes to the movie, and it's my preferred version.",1380412800,2,3528,4.555205047318612

There is also the F word once from a 13 year old.  Don't get me wrong... I love the show but didn't let my son finish watching it b/c I just didn't know what he was going to hear next. I sure didn't remember that from when I watched it in the late eighties.  Nevertheless.. it is a classic show but would have been much better without the language.

658668,5,630339406X,"Let me start by saying I've always loved this movie and am still entertained when I watch it. It has so many charming elements you could write a book describing them all. I've seen it a million times, so it seems. Undortunately, when you watch any given movie that much you catch the flaws. Most have already probably been pointed out but there's a glaring one that I think is subtle yet the greatest.

Compare Hank's character portrayal to Forrest Gump and you find many similarities. But this man-child in Big isn't borderline 'retarded', he's a 13 year old boy. That said, does Hanks play a convincing 13 year old? When we compare his performance to a real one (his best friend in the movie) it's sad to say Hanks actually acts more like an 8 year old throughout, and what's more is everyone falls for it. It's one thing to offset an ironic childish maneuver or statement with a sly grin or chuckle, it's another to never do so and hence act like a retarded man or eight year old child. Hank's charachter never shows the wit to suggest to other adults that he isn't just being ironic and I don't think any adult would take him seriously the way they took Peter Sellers' Clancy gardener character in the movie 'Being There'. Sorry to point it out.

But if you ignore this and focus on the fantasy, well, this movie is a sweet sentimental treat about the child in all of us.",1364860800,,1375,4.430830039525691

658878,4,630339406X,"I am a big fan of Hoagy Carmichael's ""Heart and Soul"" and when I saw a brief clip of Tom Hanks playing this song on the step piano, I had to watch this movie. I tried to find it on Netflix to no avail. I tried Amazon Instant Video, but I decided to jump in and spend the extra $8 to have the Blu Ray copy. I am glad I did. This movie is a instant classic. I had no idea what I was in for. I don't want to ruin the movie, but it is a very funny movie in which Tom Hanks becomes BIG basically. Hanks does an amazing job acting like a 13 year old living as a 30 year old. The most memorable part was when Hanks and his boss were playing Heart and Soul as well as the Chopstick March on the step piano.

Never once did the movie slow down or became boring. I was craving for more and fell in to the entire setting and the plot of the movie. The acting was great and the entire cast did an superb job. Overall, the movie deserves 5 stars for it's clever laughs, amazing acting, magnitude of imagination and nostalgia. Nonetheless, when the ending came along, I was left in shock wondering what just happened. Is that it? What happens next? There has to be additional footage. It cannot end like this. It called for a sequel perhaps, but I don't know if it ever came out. If someone knows, please inform me! If you never watched this movie and would like to experience 80's nostalgia, it is highly recommended.

PROS:
+ Excellent Acting
+ Great Plot and Story
+ Worth the $10 to belong in my collection

CONS:
- Ending left more to be desired
- Slightly grainy picture (not a big deal)",1347321600,5,1579,4.087096774193548
658879,5,630339406X,I know I saw this in the 1990s but forgot all about it so it was like I was watching the movie for the first time even though I knew what it was about. This is my favorite childhood movie.,1345334400,,188,3.725
658880,5,630339406X,"During 1988, there were at least four films that had the same idea of putting a child into a grown man's body.  Only one of them really worked and it was with the film Big.  The film is about a kid named Joshua Baskin.  While trying to impress a girl by riding a roller coaster, he is deemed to be too small and is not let onto the ride.  Feeling depressed, he goes to a wishing machine and wishes that he was ""big.""  The next morning, Joshua wakes up to discover that he is big but not in the way he imagined it.  He wakes up in the body of a grown adult and spends the rest of the film trying to become a kid again.  He heads off to New York City with his best friend in the hopes of trying to find the machine and figure out how to explain Joshua's absence from his family.  In the hands of lesser talent, this film would have been a disaster.  Fortunately, the film went on to become one of the highest grossing films of 1988 thanks to terrific direction, a fantastic Oscar-nominated screenplay and the performance of a lifetime given by Tom Hanks.  Hanks went on to win a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.  Personally, I feel as though we would have won if Rain Man had not come out during the same year and Dustin Hoffman giving a truly memorable performance.  Hanks is completely believable as a 13-year-old kid trapped in the body of a 35-year-old.  We truly feel for Joshua as he learns about to complexities of adulthood with the longing for childhood.  The film is full of classic scenes such as Joshua using the large keyboard in the department store, his first time having a female over and especially the ending.  The supporting is cast is also terrific.  I personally felt that Elizabeth Perkins and the boy that played Joshua's friend should have received Oscar-nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Supporting Actors along with the film receiving a best picture nomination.  The screenplay touches on a wide variety of subjects such as valuing your childhood, the difficulty and challenges of growing up and really deciding on what you want.  For the kid in all of us, I would absolutely recommend this film to everyone.  It receives my highest rating of 5 out of 5 stars.",1329609600,3,2290,4.448441247002398
658881,5,630339406X,"Again, Tom Hanks from the mid 80's to the early 00's was TOTALLY awesome.  He's really good in a sincere, dramatic role.  Of course this movie is proof that he's a pretty darn good comedian too!

Ah, being a kid again.  Wouldn't you love to go back to your early teenage years?  Yes, you would.  Rediscover what the world was like at such a young age without worrying about bills, your health or your future?  Back when friendships were in full swing, and relationships seemed like a thing that would never happen to you.  Back then your only *real* worries were turning in your homework assignments so Mrs. Raymond wouldn't get upset.

Oh who am I kidding- I never grew up!  I'm living this fantastic life every single waking moment, haha!

All joking aside (though I'm not actually joking about that- I'm a little kid in a grown mans body!) Big is a welcome addition to any movie library.  The glowing 5-star reviews you see here on amazon are no mistake ladies and gentlemen- this film will have you wishing you were young again.

I have nothing but overwhelmingly positive things to say about Big.  I just love watching a 30-year old man (the same age as me, coincidentally) having the absolute time of his life acting childish, and totally enjoying himself.  You will see Tom Hanks playing pinball and getting into hissy fits, having fun with a pinball machine, and squirting silly string at his best friend.

Of course the storyline is that he works for a company that comes up with toy inventions, and well... isn't THAT a fitting job for a child living inside a full grown mans body?  haha

He finds a woman at his workplace and they hit off a great relationship.  He actually manages to get the woman to loosen up and stop acting so darn serious all the time!  Have some fun!  Jump on the trampoline with the lights on and the window blinds open!

Before any of these major changes take place however, the character of Tom Hanks finds a magical wishing machine while visiting a carnival with his family.  Well this machine surely made one of his wishes come true- to be big.

Now the ending... I guess it's a pretty good ending.  Perhaps it felt a little undeveloped/anticlimactic for my tastebuds, because I was assuming he'd go to sleep, wake up and be young again.  Nopers!

Overall, enjoy Big.  Being a kid again... ah, what a trip!",1327795200,,2345,4.5587529976019185
658882,5,630339406X,"This review is for the EXTENDED VERSION of the movie BIG, starring of course, Tom Hanks.

The original movie was very good to great, with some incredible lead acting. But the original always had some notable flaws related to character or story development.

Problems such as, why didn't the parents put forth significant effort for law enforcement to search for the missing child?

How is the neighbor best friend (only ""six months older"") have such extensive survival skills for maneuvering in the big city while the lead character has none?

How do the two youths know to go to Consumer Affairs to search for parks that might have a Zoltar machine in its possession?

Why doesn't the character Josh Baskins make a greater effort to contact his family?

Why does Billy get so mad at Josh after one solitary, insignificant snub?

How does Josh come to be adorned with such a garish tuxedo?

I will stop there to save some surprises for those who have never watched the Extended Version.

Suffice it to say, that the Extended Version should have been the THEATRICAL VERSION from the start... it is perfectly paced and answers all of the questions which modestly impede the original version.

I will never be able to watch the regular theatrical release again... the extended version is vastly superior. Now if only all of my favorite movies could be released in such a format.",1326067200,3,1375,4.788135593220339

658947,5,630339406X,"""Big"" was made over 20 years ago in 1988.  Tom Hanks was just the right age and perfect star for this role.  It amazes me how well he interprets being a young boy in a man's 30 year old body.  The young boy is named Josh Baskin (David Moskow), who has a crush on an older girl.  While at an amusement park, he is stunned to learn she is dating  a boy that is old enough to drive.  He leaves her in line for a ride, as he is disqualified for being too short for the thrill ride on a roller coaster.  Soon he makes a wish at a carnival ""Magic Seer"" machine.  It is an old machine and the robot inside looks devilish with red flashing eyes.  Josh wishes to only be ""big"" and receives a card from the machine saying his wish will be granted.  He goes to sleep that night at home in a room shared with his baby sister and wakes up a grown man.  He is astounded and frightened as well.  When he tries to tell his mother he grew up overnight, she screams and becomes panicky - and thinks this man has stolen her boy.

Josh realizes he can't go back home until he returns to his normal size.  So the next day he travels with his 12 year old friend with the mission to find the same machine that can fix his wish to be a boy again.  Because of his youthful mind, he gets a job in a toy company and moves up fast as he knows what toys kids like, and what to make that will sell.  He has to adjust to adult ways, and Hanks plays the role to the hilt!  Hanks, as Josh,  also plays the best childlike romantic lead with a woman (Elizabeth Perkins - who looks like a young Judy Garland).  I laughed as he tried to eat cocktail corn at a party.  His apartment was nothing but a playground and the whole story was fresh and appealing.  What fun to be young at heart and be paid for it.  The movie is one of the most classy and appealing stories I have enjoyed.

This movie is a classy classic.",1293494400,3,1877,3.973190348525469

What it does have is higher picture quality and sound. There are details I hadn't noticed before. Is it worth this purchase? That all depends on how much of a home theater buff you are. If you want blu-ray quality video and audio, then you will most likely want to upgrade this classic 1988 flick; otherwise, you might be content to hold onto your DVD version until something significantly better comes out.

When it was first released in 1988, ""Big"" instantly became one of my favorite films. 20 years later, I can still say the same thing. This film not only ""holds up"" well, it is still a timeless classic. It is the story of 12 year old Josh Baskin, who wishes he were ""big"" after being humiliated at a carnival for not being tall enough to ride an attraction in front of the classmate that he has a crush on. His wish is granted by the arcade machine, Zoltar, and the next morning, he wakes up as a 30 year old (Tom Hanks). He's kicked out of the house by his mother, who thinks he is a pervert who has broken in. To make matters worse, he can't reverse the wish for at least another 30 days. On the advice of his best buddy, Billy (Jared Rushton), he gets a job in New York City to pass the time and earn some money to live on. Josh quickly moves up the ladder at MacMillan Toy Company, and also attracts the attention of Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins), who has made a habit of sleeping with the new up-and-coming executives. The longer he inhabits his 30-year old body, the more he grows away from his childhood buddy, Billy. However, the day of reckoning eventually comes when he must make a choice.

Hanks & Perkins give outstanding performances; instead of ""playing"" a 12 year old, Hanks actually becomes one. His innocence is totally believable. Perkins plays the part of the ambitious Susan to perfection, and she is the perfect love interest for Hanks. Talk about chemistry!

Just like its DVD counterpart, the Blu-Ray version gives you 2 versions of the movie; one is the theatrical version, and the other is an Extended Cut (note: NOT a director's cut...just an extra 20 minutes or so added back in). Skip the extended version; it adds nothing, and if anything slows the pacing down and adds sub plots that are meaningless (example: Billy's shrewish mother, played by Frances Fisher). The picture is wonderful; good detail and color. Sound is a DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 Surround track (48kHz/24-bit) that sounds pleasing, but other than the Billy Idol ""Hot in the City"" Limo scene, doesn't really get much of a chance to shine. Video is presented in a remastered 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 transfer (1.85:1) and looks very good but won't blow your socks off. Extras are all presented in 480i/MPEG-2.

There is an interesting ""commentary"" track by the writers/creators of ""Big,"" Gary Ross & Anne Spielberg. Although extremely interesting, this would have been better as an audio-only supplement. A nice commentary that corresponds with the picture by director Marshall or Hanks would have been better. The track consists of current interviews with Ross & Spielberg (yes, Steven's sister) who introduce vintage audio tapes that they made while they brainstormed the idea of what would become ""Big."" The tapes do not correspond to what you see on your screen. Yes, it is interesting, but after awhile, it gets somewhat annoying having to listen to Gary continually talk over Anne and not letting her ideas be heard. It does appear that much of the movie that we know and love came from Anne, who quietly (and thankfully) persisted with her vision.

Deleted scenes with commentary by director Penny Marshall (but if you watch the extended cut, none of these will be new for you). For one of her first movies, she does an excellent job. As did Anne, she had a vision of what the film and especially Hanks' performance should be and she stuck with it, despite the risks (example: at least 3 other age-change movies were ready for release before ""Big"" would be finished). There are a number of featurettes: ""Big Beginnings"", ""Chemistry of a Classic"", AMC Backstory, ""The Work of Play,"" and ""Carnival Party Newswrap"" (a vintage film showing the wrap party for ""Big.""). There is a fair amount of overlap in all the extras, as Marshall, Ross, and Spielberg are the main contributors. Still, plenty of interesting tidbits; we came this close to seeing Robert DeNiro in the lead role. It is also interesting to hear the young stars of the film, David Moscow (young Josh) and Jared Rushton, discuss the filming. Perkins also gives some fun insights as well. Theatrical trailer and TV Spots round out this edition.

If Blu-ray is to succeed, then some of the other studios besides Disney need to really step up to the plate and offer something that takes advantage of the format, rather than just shuffling over material from previously released DVD's. Disney puts most of their extras in high-def as well, whereas Fox and other studios seem content to only upgrade the movie itself.

While it`s good to see ""Big"" on Blu-ray, I wouldn't recommend that people rush right out to buy this one.",1242604800,32,5363,4.87390350877193
659028,5,630339406X,"Compared to earlier releases, this looks amazing! It doesn't have that sharpness that makes modern blu-rays amazingly detailed, but it's not needed or missed. Watching this is like watching it in a theater. If your TV or player has a Cinema or Movie mode (which mutes colors and/or softens the picture) turn it off. The movie already has the ""soft"" cinema look those modes induce. That being said, the colors are absolutely perfect, and it's hard to take your eyes away; especially if you've seen this before. The blacks are always inky, and overall there are never speckling or noise artifacts.

The sound is punched up to modern standards as well (see below) and sounds amazing in surround (considering how the previous releases sounded). It's up to modern day standards for a drama/comedy. Dialog is clear and easy to understand, and surround and L/R components are present only when appropriate, not just to show off surround technology. But when it does kick in (for scenes with music, etc.), it's enveloping. Definitely up to par with modern movies.

You have a choice of the regular or extended edition. The extended edition is fun. I've seen this movie many times, and the extra/extended scenes make it a lot of fun, since you never know when they're going to occur. Overall, if this is currently, or ever has been one of your favorites, you need to get it, even if you have it on DVD. It will be one of your favorites again!

And who can not love the scene in the toy store where Hanks's and Robert Loggia's characters are playing Heart and Soul on the giant floor piano.",1215388800,,437,4.341463414634147
659085,5,630339406X,"The fact that I absolutely adore this movie comes as a huge shock to me since Tom Hanks is one of those actors I find completely overrated.  There are really only a handful of his films I can even attest to enjoying (`Cast Away', shockingly, as well as `Saving Private Ryan') but for the most part I find his work a tad overrated (ala `Forest Gump' and `Philadelphia').  `Big', of all of Hanks' work, is probably my favorite.  It is most definitely my favorite performance he's ever given and honestly this very performance may cause me to rethink everything I've already concluded about this Hollywood icon.

Penny Marshal's extremely successful family hit `Big' tells the story of twelve-year-old Josh, a kid tired of being a kid who makes a hasty wish to be an adult and winds up getting exactly what he wished for, with mixed results.  Unable to explain what happened to him, Josh takes off from home until he can sort things out.  This leaves him alone and confused and his parents distraught and heartbroken.  Soon Josh starts to adjust, quite well at that.  He lands himself a high profile job, acquires a very nice apartment and ends up dating a beautiful coworker.

While everything may seem to be going in the right direction, `Big' ever so delicately asks whether or not a normal childhood is worth giving up.

The script is beautifully written; in such a way that one can't help but relate to the main characters and become a part of their story.  This is also hinged strongly on Hanks' masterful performance.  He really adapts the mannerisms and mental wavelength of a child of twelve and exhibits those characteristics perfectly.  He becomes Josh (thanks to some great method acting from what I hear) and thus sells us on a rather preposterous story.

The rest of the cast also delivers strongly here, especially the likes of Elizabeth Perkins and Robert Loggia.  Perkins plays Josh's love interest Susan with ample amounts curiosity and admiration.  She becomes a believable woman, a believable lover.  Robert Loggia doesn't have a lot of screen time, but he is love for me here.  Seriously, his little piano-key dancing scene with Hanks is my favorite scene in the film, and the look on his face is that look of found boyishness that just exudes such presence.  John Heard nails the egotistical corporate climber as Paul, Josh's nemeses.  He is the memorable villain, the guy you love to hate.

Young actor Jared Rushton (of `Honey I Shrunk the Kids' fame) delivers a fine performance as well here, matching Hanks almost every step of the way; and Mercedes Ruehl's tortured mother is touching and heartbreaking all at the same time.

What is so great about `Big' is that it manages to be lighthearted and warm while still tackling a big message.  It never waters down its message or makes light of it in order to sell itself as a family `fluff' film but instead creates a very touching and moving experience that makes us think and laugh at the same time.  While I feel that there is something extremely `wrong' with this film (I just had this shiver go down my spine when I realized that Josh and Susan, you know, did `it') I can't help but love it despite its questionable deviance from morality.  I'm not picking just so you know, and I understand that it is a `movie', but come on; you can't tell me that the fact that he was twelve didn't just hit you with unease.

Anyways...

Penny Marshall is one of our great female directors today.  She knows how to make a memorable and tender film (if you don't believe me then watch `Awakenings' and call me after you dry your tear drenched face) and `Big' is no exception.  Probably her biggest hit (although I think I prefer `Awakenings') and one of her most widely acclaimed motion pictures, `Big' is truly one of a kind.  Hanks outdoes himself here and truly changes my perception of his career.",1213574400,2,3861,4.668639053254438

Josh quickly moves up the ladder at MacMillan Toy Company, and also attracts the attention of Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins), who has made a habit of sleeping with the new up-and-coming executives. The longer he inhabits his 30-year old body, the more he grows away from his childhood buddy, Billy. However, the day of reckoning eventually comes when he must make a choice.

Hanks & Perkins give outstanding performances; instead of ""playing"" a 12 year old, Hanks actually becomes one. His innocence is totally believable. Perkins plays the part of the ambitious Susan to perfection, and she is the perfect love interest for Hanks. Talk about chemistry!

This 2-Disc Edition gives you 2 versions of the movie; one is the theatrical version, and the other is an Extended Cut (note: NOT a director's cut...just an extra 20 minutes or so added back in). Skip the extended version; it adds nothing, and if anything slows the pacing down and adds sub plots that are meaningless (example: Billy's shrewish mother, played by Frances Fisher). The picture is wonderful; good detail and color. The sound is extremely disappointing. A 2 channel stereo mix? Where's the 5.1? In this day and age, hard to believe they couldn't have put together a nice surround mix for this one. It would really be fantastic in the Billy Idol limo scene!

There is an interesting ""commentary"" track by the writers/creators of ""Big,"" Gary Ross & Anne Spielberg. Although extremely interesting, this would have been better as an audio-only supplement. A nice commentary that corresponds with the picture by director Marshall or Hanks would have been better. The track consists of current interviews with Ross & Spielberg (yes, Steven's sister) who introduce vintage audio tapes that they made while they brainstormed the idea of what would become ""Big."" The tapes do not correspond to what you see on your screen. Yes, it is interesting, but after awhile, it gets somewhat annoying having to listen to Gary continually talk over Anne and not letting her ideas be heard. It does appear that much of the movie that we know and love came from Anne, who quietly (and thankfully) persisted with her vision.

Disc 2 includes deleted scenes with commentary by director Penny Marshall. For one of her first movies, she does an excellent job. As did Anne, she had a vision of what the film and especially Hanks' performance should be and she stuck with it, despite the risks (example: at least 3 other age-change movies were ready for release before ""Big"" would be finished). There are a number of featurettes: ""Big Beginnings"", ""Chemistry of a Classic"", AMC Backstory, ""The Work of Play,"" and ""Carnival Party Newswrap"" (a vintage film showing the wrap party for ""Big.""). There is a fair amount of overlap in all the extras, as Marshall, Ross, and Spielberg are the main contributors. Still, plenty of interesting tidbits; we came this close to seeing Robert DeNiro in the lead role. It is also interesting to hear the young stars of the film, David Moscow (young Josh) and Jared Rushton, discuss the filming. Perkins also gives some fun insights as well. Theatrical trailer and TV Spots round out this edition.

Overall, a nice set, but there is definitely room to grow for the next outing of this classic film.",1206921600,14,4100,4.712691771269177

And ""Big""  not only smartly innovated the proposal around the always disturbing question: what if you or me had the chance to return over our vanished youthful? But answered and cleverly responded as a joke. As you may realize, a considerable number of Fellini works (Amarcord, The clowns)turned around this aspect.

But the touch of genius of the screenwriters was to employ two well defined ages (adult and son and exchange them); allowing to express a duality with the expected tangles of the case.

And if we scrutinize with detail, we should cite this celebrated film as the second most original comedy of the eighties,  because of the fact Zelig was much more audacious, irreverent and loaded of major sardonic intentions.

He is one of the few actors who started off as a comic and made a successful transition to dramatic actor that was accepted by audiences and peers alike.  This was, I believe, his transition role that would lead him into his dramatic future.

Tom Hanks plays Josh (as an adult).  Josh makes a wish on a carnival game that he were big.  The next day, he wakes up a 12 year old boy in a 30 year old's body.  Suddenly driven out of the house, he is now forced into the adult world overnight and must deal with all the hilarious adult things from a kid's perspective.

It was a good movie, put into that catagory of ""feel good"", to be sure.  But, it was a little too hooky for my tastes now.  When he wakes up a 30 year old man, how would he ever get his own place to live, a job, and a girlfriend if he had the mind of a 12 year old?  In New York City, no less.  The scene in the toy store was cute, of course, and it just so happens that he gets a job working for a toy company.

I recently read that they changed the ending.  The original ending was that he would make a wish on the same game to be 12 again, and, his girlfriend would also wish to be 12 with him.

After being humiliated at a carnival by the fact that his crush is allowed onto a roller coaster and he's still to little he decides to go to a wishing game where he wish's that he was big. In the morning Josh wake's up as a 30 year old man, terrified his mother make's him leave the house. With no where to go he rents an apartment in New York and  gets a job at FAO Schwartz toy company where he quickly progress's up the ladder in the company.

659412,5,630339406X,"Josh Baskin is a 13 year old boy (David Moscow), suffering from the inequities of being too young and small to have any control in his life. The girl he crushes on is dating a bigger, older boy and he can't even get on a carnival ride because he doesn't reach the minimum required height. He chances upon Zoltar, a spooky fortune telling machine, and impulsively wishes he were big. The wish is granted and Josh wakes up the next morning transformed into a 30 year old man (Tom Hanks).

But, to bastardize Stan Lee's famous line, with a ""big"" body comes big responsibility. Josh manages to luck into a highly ranked position at a toy company and even cluelessly ends up with a hot girlfriend (the very grown up Elizabeth Perkins). With only his 13 year-old best friend Billy as a confidant, Josh must navigate thru the minefield of burdens and hangups (eking out a livelihood, the pressure and jealousies in the work area, adult relationships, etc) normally associated with growing up. Josh, thru the course of the film, comes to realize he isn't ready to be a grown-up and that being a kid is actually a pretty cool thing to be. Now, if he could only find that dang fortune telling machine.

Tom Hanks delightfully channels his inner kid in this modern fairy tale. I really can't think of anyone else who could've been as convincing and charming as Hanks in portraying a grown-up with the mind of an adolescent. Elizabeth Perkins, as the very poised but baffled Susan Lawrence, effectively plays her role as initially calculating but, by the film's closing scenes, she'll end up tugging at your heartstrings. Robert Loggia, as Mr. MacMillan, the elderly but young-at-heart owner and head honcho of the MacMillan Toys Company, is disarming and infectious (in the good sense, not in the sense that he'll give you a disease). Everyone touts the ""Chopsticks"" scene with Loggia and Hanks as a classic standout of the film.

Big ties with A League of Their Own as Penny Marshall's best directing effort. There's a reason Big made Marshall the first female director to surpass $100 million in the box office. She not only elicits very nice performances from her cast but she also injects into her film wholesome humor and warmth, a tastefully done romantic arc, and an insightful perspective about what it's like to be mired in adulthood and how, sometimes, we grownups are all either just going thru the motions or taking life too seriously.

The only thing I found disquieting is the kidnapping subplot, which introduces a jarring element and clashes with the overall gentle tone of the film. The script handles it as discreetly and as ""kid-gloves"" as possible, but one can't help but empathize with the mostly off-screen grieving mother. And that's my only quibble.

One night, at the carnival with his family, after being totally humiliated in front of his crush, he finds this wish machine and grants him one wish. He wishes to become `big'. The next day, he wakes up to find himself to be an adult. When his mother sees him, he is chased out of the house not knowing what to do next. He and his best friend find some money and they travel to New York. There he finds a job in the toy making industry. There he meets a woman named Susan. She finds his childish behavior kind of weird in the beginning but later on gets use to it. He soon realizes, with the help of his best friend, that he is only a 13 year old and helps him find the wish machine to get him back to normal. Josh has to make the decision between staying a 30 year old with Susan or going back to being a little kid. Overall this movie was pretty good. My favorite part was when the main character, Josh, is playing in the toy store on the large piano.",1154736000,,1064,4.023584905660377

While living in New York, Josh has many responsibilities as he maintains a job. He also deals with his relationship with Susan. In the end, Josh has to decide weather to stay as an adult, or return to being a kid again.

I enjoyed watching this movie. It deals with the many problems that adults and kids face. It teaches kids that growing up aren't all fun and games and that they have more responsibilities as an adult. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy. Seeing how a kid takes on adult responsibilities is comical. One of my favorite scenes is when McMillan and Josh play on the giant piano. The actor's play the roles very well as you forget how absurd it is for a kid to wake up as an adult. I highly recommend this movie.",1153872000,,1061,4.175609756097561

659502,5,630339406X,"The film that propelled Tom Hanks to superstar status, Big is one of the funniest and most friendly films to ever hit the big screen. Harboring its own unique charm, the movie wraps a unique and compelling storyline around a cast of likeable characters to create a film audiences will never forget. Director Penny Marshall became the first woman to direct a film grossing over one-hundred million dollars when Big was first released in 1988 (that's an actual Trivial Pursuit question I ran across that might come in handy someday)...

When a young suburban boy named Josh (David Moscow) attends a local carnival with his family, his young life is turned upside down when the girl he has a crush on is allowed on a rollercoaster while he learns that he is still too young. Distraught, the boy makes a wish on an antique magic wish arcade machine. He wishes he was big, and the machine spits out its answer on a small piece of cardboard, ""Wish granted."" Josh thinks nothing of the reply until he wakes up the next morning as an adult version of himself (Tom Hanks).

Run out of the house by his own mother, Josh turns to his best friend Billy (Jared Rushton) for help. But after convincing his friend, who's only ten-years-old himself, Billy can't provide much help except a small bit of cash and advice on getting a job. When Josh rents an apartment in New York City, Billy comes to visit him periodically. Playing guns in the toy store FAO Schwartz, the two run into MacMillan (Robert Loggia) founder of a toy manufacturer. MacMillan hits it off with Josh (the two men step dance a Chopin tune on a giant foot-operated piano in an extremely memorable and famous scene), and the toy titan immediately hires Josh to work for his company in the area of toy-related research.

Climbing the corporate totem pole at MacMillan because of his vast insight into the toy preferences of kids, Josh befriends Susan (Elizabeth Perkins), a top-level executive hoping to learn what makes Josh such a master of the boardroom. But Susan's pursuit of Josh is not looked upon favorably by her colleague Paul (John Heard) who's spent his entire career kissing up to MacMillan only to have the inexperienced Josh appear out of nowhere and become the boss's favorite. This conflict, coupled with the breakdown of Josh and Billy's relationship, causes the adult kid to wish he could be his young self once again...

One of the best scenes in the film is when Susan reveals to Josh that she can't believe she's considering sleeping over at his home. Josh replies by saying he does it all the time and gives her the option of the top or the bottom bunk! Hanks really comes off as a kid trapped in an adult's body, and that's why Big works so well. So well, in fact, that it became an instant comedy classic...

Prior to Sleepless In Seattle, Forrest Gump, and Saving Private Ryan, Tom Hanks took Hollywood by storm with his charming performance in this larger than life movie. Big is a feel-good comedy without any foul language, gratuitous violence, or endless explosions. It simply retells the timeless tale of a young boy who wishes he were grown and doing grown up things - only in this instance, the kid gets his wish. As one of the biggest blockbusters of the 1980s, Big is a definite must-see film. Don't hesitate to see it...

659503,4,630339406X,"Tom Hanks is the grown-up man with the 13-year-old mind. As aboy he makes a wish in front of a carnival fortune-telling machine to be big, and his wish is granted (physically but not mentally). He goes on a search to find the machine to change the wish; in the meantime he gets a job with a toy company. Basically the movie then becomes one long joke about a ""child"" in the adult world, but it tends toward other issues, too - the loss of innocence and that surface honesty that is so prevalent in childhood and then disappears in adulthood. Hanks, of course, is a hit at the toy company (what 13 year old wouldn't be?). But he falls in love with a co-worker, which makes the decision to go back to 13 again at the end more heartrending. Hanks is very good in this child's role. Worth a watch.",1113696000,3,793,4.258278145695364

This film has aged really well; the comedy and dialogue is really sharp, the acting is believable and there's never a dull moment. Instead of going over the story, I want to quote what screenwriting legend, Robert McKee wrote about the film which rings true; ""At the crisis, Josh [Tom Hanks] faces irreconcilable goods; an adult life with a fulfilling career and the woman he loves verus a return to adolescence. He makes the mature choice to have his childhood expressing with fine irony that he at last became 'big'. For he and we sense that the key to maturity is to have had a complete childhood. But becuase life has short-changed so many of us in youth, we live, to one degree or another, in a false sense of maturity. BIG is a very wise film.""

Sure the toys have changed and yes, Billy Idol is tied to the soundtrack but the message still remains the same. This should be required viewing for all families.",1107043200,61,955,4.482758620689655

The movie starts off by making everyone reminisce (well, NOW anyway) by showing the old games, which you thought were state-of-the-art at the time! Now you see them, and you see rubbish graphics, and you had to type what you wanted the characters to do - I remember those! And the film quickly goes on from there.
I'm not sure what it was about the movie, but I wasn't all that keen on it. It seems to drag in the middle, and the whole idea of the movie is forgotton. The mum isn't included as much, it would have been nice to maybe see Tom Hanks come back and see her again, instead of just phoning her. My other quibble is that it's only rated a PG - so much more could have been done with the movie, if it had been a 15, maybe NOT an 18. But I guess they were aiming at the kids, so putting it in some (funny) sex scenes would have not been allowed. Boo.
Tom Hanks is perfect as the kid in a man's body - to me, he seems all arms and legs, awkward and gangly.

659541,4,630339406X,"""Big"" is funny. Tom Hanks in ""Big"" is as funny as in Forrest Gump, as touching as ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" and as goofy as ""Turner and Hooch."" You see the beginnings of the star of ""Castaway,"" ""Apollo 13,"" and ""Catch Me If You Can."" Hanks took on a solid movie and made it a great one.

The story is simple, based on classic plotlines that extend back through fairy tales. Josh, the boy, is bummed his life is dictated by his small size and young age. He is unexpectedly granted his wish to be 'big', which means 30 years old. He then faces the adventures of being a grown-up.

Scenes from this movie are famous, including the FAO Schwarz toy store dance on the keyboard floor mat. It has everything a vaudeville skit would have, from music to dance to the mix of an old and young man. It works incredibly well. Chopsticks has never been as entertaining.

Josh becomes by serendipity the VP of toy development. Despite his immaturity, the owner feels Josh is tuned into the pulse of youth, unlike the lackeys cranking out marketing reports. His colleagues become jealous of his fast rise and unsuccessfully try to root him out. One of those trying to learn his game is Susan, but he wins her over in a confusing escapade of love.

The movie is an overall pile of fun, but lacks in a few areas. It is dated, very stuck in the 1980s. That is tolerable. Had Josh been kidnapped, why wasn't his boyhood friend interviewed by police? Why didn't Josh ever confide in Susan while they fell in love? A number of other unanswered questions develop at the end dealing with his job, his apartment, his bank account.

Even though I have questions, the movie is still a keeper. It is funny, makes strong statements about good parenting, and has a charm only Tom Hanks could bring. Good, clean fun... a perfect date movie.

Tom Hanks portrays a 13 year old boy, Josh, who wakes up in the body of a 30 year old man after wishing he were bigger after not being allowed on a carnival ride and being made fun of by a taller boy.  Although this theme is not unique, nobody but Tom Hanks ever gets it quite right.  Hanks obviously has not forgotten what it's like to be an adolescent boy, and the results are hilarious!  His reactions to adult situations (a really aweful tux at a formal party, making gagging noises and spitting out caviar, playing with all the buttons in the limousine, thinking his workmate just wants to SLEEP when she asks to stay overnight and innocently replying,""Well, ok, but I get to be on top"" -  meaning the top of his bunkbed) never fail to send me into fits of laughter. On the more serious side, Hanks also poignantly portrays the fear and loneliness of a young boy suddenly thrust into the hostile environment of a trashy hotel (the only place he could afford, with the help of his best friend), where sirens, gunshots, and fights are happening right outside his door. Jared Rushton is perfectly cast as his best friend, and gets a good laugh of his own when he screams his bloody head off when first approached by the adult Josh, thinking he's a pervert bent on doing him harm.

659627,5,630339406X,"Every kid has dreams of what it would be like to grow up. Usually these thoughts revolve around the material things in life, most of which include adult-type possessions like money, girls, and cars. In director Penny Marshall's BIG, Tom Hanks gives an eminently believable performance as a 13 year old boy who makes the full circle from boy to man and back to boy. Although the audience has great fun with the many truly funny scenes, the real charm of the film is not the humor of a fish out of water but the growth of a boy who has a glimpse of what it is to be a man and yet can possess the wisdom to recognize that he is not ready to permanently stay an adult if it means losing the experience that should have accompanied that growth.
 The youth Josh Baskin (David Moscow) makes a wish to be an adult at one of those carny magic fortune teller machines. Right away the audience is swooped into one of two realms: the benign universe of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or the more malignant one of the TWILIGHT ZONE where William Shatner is fed life- altering decisions by a machine that could be a clone of this one. But BIG is a sweet comedy and the audience can sense that there will indeed be comic complexities caused by Josh's getting his wish in a literal way that provides unexpected consequences.
Josh, now played by Tom Hanks, uses his charm, his youth, his zest for things juvenile to land an adult job. The core of the comedy revolves around a succession of scenes that requires a delicate balancing act for Hanks. He must try to act like an adult but still retain the mannerisms of a child. The best scenes in which he accomplishes this include the dancing on the piano scene with Robert Loggia and the more adult relationship he forges with Elizabeth Perkins, who falls for the child that she sees in the man. No one else in Hollywood could have pulled this off.
 Josh builds a life as an adult. He has all the 'toys' that he thought all adults did, but inwardly his child rebels, causing him to want to experience life but not on the cheap. Experience, he learns, is dear, and it is not enough for others to give him credit for accomplishments that they presume is the result of a more natural emotional and physical accumulation of experience. Rather, he learns that life is sort of like those goofy electronic make-up-your-life-as-you-go toys that he developed as a marketing whiz. You can push a button and get the desired result, but once having done so, the reality on the screen does not match the reality in the heart. And for the young Josh or the old Josh or the audience, this is a very adult lesson indeed.",1025395200,,2626,4.4235537190082646
659628,5,630339406X,"This has to be one of the greatest films all of all times,EVER!!
 Tom Hanks did an exellent job playing a young boy(Joshua ""Josh"" Baskins) trapped in a grown mans' body. A child trying to make it in a rough world, living as an adult,but only in the flesh.
The writing was excellent! The entire casts' acting was superb! Penny Marshall has directed a true gem that has been a classic for about 14 years now, and will remain a classic for decades to come.
 Living in New York as I do, It was really fun to know that the area where Josh met up with the fortune teller machine was shot on location at Rye Playland about 40 minutes driving time from where I live(pretty cool, huh?)I go in that area at times just to rekindle the movie shot(I'm pathetic,right?)
 One of the funniest movie scences I can remember is when his (somewhat) love interest,Susan (played beautifully by Elizabeth perkins) tries to get romantic with Josh, but all he seems to care about is jumping on the trampling and seeing who gets to sleep on the TOP bunk.(His young mind cannot comprehend what she means when she says she wants to ""SLEEP"" with him). Those are classic ""BIG"" moments, along with him playing the gaint Step-On Keyboard at FAO Schwarz Toy Store that will never leave my memory! It was very interesting seeing Tom Hanks show his boyish side; that innocent charm that very few actors could have probably pulled off so well. I also like the moral to the story as well, JUST LIKE THEY SAY: ""Be careful what you wish for,'cause you may get it"". Every wish comes with a price. There's no such thing as a perfect wish.

 P.S. I think Tom Hanks was perfect for the part of Josh,but do you think anybody else could have done a good job as well? What about Bill Murray or Robin Williams? What do you think?

The wonderfully versatile Tom Hanks stars as Josh Baskin, a 12 year old boy who makes a wish on a carnival wishing machine. His wish is to be 'BIG'....and to his amazement wakes up the next morning with the body of a 30 year old. Confused and frightened at being thrust into the adult world, Josh (with the help of his best friend) runs away to New York, where by sheer luck he lands a job in a Toy company. There he discovers the advantages of being big: freedom,money,unlimited toys and junk food. But he's not prepared for what happens when he attracts sexy co-worker-chic, ambitious and predatory Susan Lawrence. Josh is torn between the freedom of being an adult (with a 12 year old brain)and the love and security of his homelife. BIG is great entertainment, it is often touching but always BIG on laughs!
Written by coproducers Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg. Tom Hanks' 11th film. BIG was later a broadway musical.",1010448000,6,997,4.735632183908046

659633,4,630339406X,"This film is great fun but with a serious message. While telling the fantasy story about a boy who grows from twelve to thirty overnight it also tells us something about the problems we all experience over a few years while growing up. It's also a satire of the ridiculous corporate system that operates in large companies where employees are appointed 'Vice Presidents' and have a 'Xerox room'. Hanks is well-cast in the main role, bringing just the right balance of humour and pathos. I shudder to think what would have happened if Robin Williams had got hold of the same material. The highlight of the film is where Hanks and his boss dance on a giant set of piano keys playing jolly tunes.",1007337600,,693,4.596774193548387

Anyhow, this a charming film.  The real message for most of us is to try to look at the world - at least on occasion - with the eyes of a child.  See the absurdities and laugh at what is genuinely funny.  And, most of all, eat those minature corn cobs just like a big corn on the cob.",1005782400,4,528,3.943396226415094
659675,5,630339406X,"Still my all time favorite Tom Hanks movie, this movie really is magical.  It takes a really great actor to pull off this kind of switch, adolescent boy becomes a man after wishing he was ""big"".  The story is masterfully written and expertly acted.
Hanks is able to pull off getting a job, getting promoted and finding a beautiful girl friend, but like many of us ""real adults"" we find that being a man isn't always what it is cracked up to be.  Loneliness and frustration set in and we know something is wrong with our world.  Hanks portrays the struggle in a way that comes across as real and when he tells his girlfriend that he is ""just a kid"", well the humor is doubly ironic.
Both an entertaining movie for adults and kids, a good family library film, highly recommended.",1005350400,,777,4.450704225352113

659677,4,630339406X,"Tom Hanks is terrific in this film.  He plays Josh Baskin, a twelve-year-old boy who has been transformed physically into an adult.  He projects the awkwardness and innocence of youth well and is supported by a good screenplay that makes the most of this fantastic situation.  Screenwriters Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg had the inspiration to place this naive, goodhearted character among the competitive, cut-throat yuppies on the staff of a major toy company.  Josh's insights into what appeals to kids (after all, he really is one) allows him to advance rapidly, much to the dismay of his coworkers, who see in his every action the same kind of manipulation and scheming that enabled them to reach their positions.  The juxtaposition makes Josh seem like the real grown-up and provides an interesting opportunity to appreciate how important it is to hang on to some of our more child-like qualities as we grow older./",999734400,2,920,4.9869281045751634

659681,4,630339406X,"This is the Tom Hanks you've probably forgotten.  You now know him as the serious, dramatic, critical darling of reviewers and the Academy Awards.  This is the Tom Hanks who first got notice from the Oscars back in the late 80s, and he is no less spectacular than the Hanks of Saving Private Ryan, Philadelphia, Apollo 13, or Castaway.
Young Josh, who actually is young in the beginning of the film, longs for the day when he will be an adult--""big.""  In an odd tempting of fate, his wish is granted, and he wakes up as Hanks.  Hanks, still holding the mind and emotions of the young teen Josh, must now make it in the world as an adult, despite the fact he is anything but.
For his acting challenge, the adult becomes a child, and experiences all the awkwardness of that child becoming the adult he in fact already is.  Of course, his boyish good looks make the visible factor already easy for the audience to believe, but it is the mindset of wonderment, innocence, matter-of-factness, and uneasiness which brings the ""young"" Josh to life.
Some of the most memorable moments of film from this time period come from Big.  The FAO Schwartz scenes involving an oversized keyboard, and the eating of baby corn ears immediately come to mind.  Directed by Penny Marshall, Tom Hanks easily convinced us of an impossible scenario, and pulled on our heartstrings while doing it. The most telling scene of his complete ability to achieve 'youth' is when he finds himself completely alone in a seedy motel, frightened out of his mind, crying himself to sleep to drown out the noise of the scary city outside the thin door.  Amazing!
This is a sweet charmer of a film, and this performance is right up there with the best of his catalogue, as well as Marshall's.  Make this a part of your permanent collection.",992476800,2,1800,4.617554858934169

I really doubt that Hollywood can make romantic comedies this good any more. Well, hopefully I'm wrong, but quite honestly, I haven't seen any better union since ""Big"" --  a screenplay so well written, a director so creative (as Penny Marshall), an actor so talented (as Tom Hanks), an actress so lovely (as Elizabeth Perkins), plus a perfect supporting cast (Robert Loggia, Jon Lovitz, Mercedes Ruehl...)

How many other actors could really make you believe that they were an 11 year old boy in a man's body?
But it really is a coming of age tale as Hanks gets to discover more than he ever bargained for in the adult world.  Both good and bad.  A discovery that all young people are beginning to make at that time in their lives anyway.  But what a privilege to be able to see the best of both worlds.  More of us could use that kind of miracle.
Whether he's squirtin' silly string out of his nose or sharing a tender moment with Elizabeth Perkins Hanks remain sincere and believable.
