2452492,3,B000C20VNC,"Like volume I of this Just for Laughs series, there are no profound social or political insights to be found here. But the comics chosen from the Montreal Comedy Festival's annual stand-up revue provide some good laughs, and above all, they provide a range of memorable comic characters.

Most of the individuals featured here have fashioned interesting on-stage personae for themselves. Without having gone so far as to become branded products on the market, they have nonetheless honed their performances into individual Dickensian idiosyncrasy.

There's Mitch Fatel who plays the simple soul. He can say outrageous things that would give offense if they were spoken by a sophisticate.

There's Mitch Hedberg who endears himself as the mellow wise man, speculating on life's misnomers. (I sleep in a twin bed. I constantly ask myself, ""Where is my brother?"")

There's Mr. Black known for living in a perpetual state of road rage.

There's Dane Cook who is the Bruce Springsteen of stand-up comedy. He eats up the stage with working class muscularity as he acts out his dilemmas.

There's Sean Cullen who puts his Irish tenor persona to good use as he illustrates how different popular singers such as Neil Young and Bob Dylan might have sounded if they had recorded theme songs for the James Bond movies.

You get the cream of the crop of stand-up comedy from this Series, without having to get dressed up, go out, and spend a lot of money in various Comedy Clubs. The laughs are brought to you. When you've had a hard day at work, I think this tape will

humorously bring home the fact that others have their perplexities too - that we all have PROBLEMS. And you'll feel better, for a little while anyway.",1140220800,14,1708,4.825342465753424

funny to watch alone or with other adults.",1483660800,,189,4.25
8095377,5,B000C20VNC,"As I said in my Comedy Central's Stand Up Picks; Part 4 review, I too bought this solely for Maria Bamford, but it's pretty okay thus far, only one sucky comic, the rest are good or decent at least. Hey, isn't that the guy from Corky and the Juice Pigs? Hey, does anyone else remember Corky and the Juice Pigs?!",1427673600,,311,4.2
8095378,2,B000C20VNC,I had bought this just because of Dane Cook it wasn't as great as expected.,1425772800,,75,4.066666666666666
8095379,1,B000C20VNC,"I have given this one star, as I do all DVD's produced by companies which discriminate against the over 60,000,000 Americans with hearing disorders by treating us all as if we don't exist and therefore don't matter a whit to them by not bothering to placed captions in their products so that we can enjoy them like our hearing-abled peers.  So, that all deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans will be treated as if we are ""created equal under God"" as our great constitution says we are, please boycott this production company and others who treat us, unapologetically, as if we don't matter by not even bothering to place captions in their DVD's as if our pain and suffering by being treated like we don't matter doesn't matter to these people at all.  Because treating an entire group of people, whether they be LGBT's, African-Americans, Mexicans, disabled, women, whathaveyou, as if they don't matter enough for you to communicate to them and meet their needs as people, for example, my own peeps, by making sure our needs to be able to simply follow a DVD like our hearing-abled counterparts, which is quite easy, for, when I started out as a videographer with only a $600 budget to my name, I was already putting subtitles in my work in foreign languages, and captioning can easily be done by putting them in as subtitles, foreign language films produced by companies who are dirt poor compared to their American and Canadian counterparts do so all the time so that all audiences of all nationalities can enjoy their work, so why can't Image-Entertainment?  What's their excuse? I know what it is: THEY JUST DON'T CARE.",1412812800,,1620,4.799283154121864

8095381,3,B000C20VNC,i was hoping to find some mitch hedberg b/c i love him but this was a variety of comedians and most of them were not very funny.,1290988800,,128,3.7777777777777777
8095382,3,B000C20VNC,"Dave Attell. Mitch Hedberg. Lewis Black. Mitch Fatel. Dane Cook. Do you really need a review for this one? I recommend this dvd for the lineup alone. Of course, the footage is from the Montreal Comedy Festival so dont' expect an abundance of blue material. But there's nothing but funny here. Though Dane Cook is the ""rock star"" of the group, comedian Greg Giraldo really steals the show on this one. His material is funny and socially relevant...",1193529600,5,447,4.743589743589744
