I'm seeing 2 newer series with Martin Shaw on Netflix, but nothing on this one.  I would dearly love to see this series in its entirety.",1353369600,5,241,4.558139534883721

8215884,5,B000UZPMIU,Typical English show but it was a good action series. The brashness and sarcasm of the guys was good.  They had a way to pushing the right buttons at the right time and getting away with blue murder. Good action and on screen chemistry made the show for me.,1206662400,6,257,4.244897959183674
