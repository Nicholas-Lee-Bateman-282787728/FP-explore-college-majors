4596823,4,B0057JIAY2,"Since I am only the second person to review this film, it's clear that it's not very well known. I had never heard of it when I stumbled upon it, and, while watching it, was surprised by a number of things: first and foremost, how good it is, how unpredictable the story is, and also how horribly grim it ends up being.

The film first introduces the audience to Erica, a promiscuous, damaged woman with seemingly no social connections. She is seen engaging in random sexual encounters, rebuffing any kind of real warmth and affection, until she takes a job at a hardware store and tentatively starts a friendship with fellow employee and veteran Nate. This part of the film is really rather sweet, and it seems like it's going to be the kind of story where two damaged people are redeemed by love.

The film then shifts its focus to one of the characters first introduced in the beginning of the film, when Erica was ""partying"" with several members of a local rock band. Franki, the lead singer, is trying to balance both his band's early success with his mother's cancer and having to work dead end jobs. Unfortunately, during this section of the film, Franki's life takes a huge turn for the worse when both his health and that of his mother's are severely threatened, and the character's meltdown leads to a series of tragic events. Franki's storyline is then tied back to that of Erica and Nate, and it's clear that, instead of a series of vignettes about characters who only meet peripherally, there is really just one story at play here.

To give much more away would be a crime, because one of the best things about the film is that it offers constant surprises. I will say that, despite (or maybe even because of) moments of tenderness and genuine human interaction, the film ends up a grim, grisly affair, albeit one that is well acted, written, and directed enough to make it worth a watch if you've got the stomach for such things. Fans of films like ""No Country for Old Men"" should check this one out.",1306195200,10,2014,4.558011049723757
4596824,4,B0057JIAY2,"Rarely is a film able to be both enticing and disturbing. There have been some pretty messed up films the past few years like Antichrist and A Serbian Film. Other than Antichrist having gorgeous cinematography, genital mutilation is probably what you'll take away from it while A Serbian Film shows you the affects it could have on someone forced to make a snuff film against their will. I Saw the Devil is a great example of being both brutal in content and absolutely engaging thanks to fantastic performances and a well-thought-out revenge plot. Now imagine having the last act of a film containing subject matter as unnerving as the violence in I Saw the Devil but leaving a little more to your imagination while the first two acts remind you of something straight out of an Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu film and you've got Red White & Blue in a nutshell.

When Red White & Blue first gets going, you probably won't really know what to think. Some chick is just running around having sex with a handful of various men every night? So what? But it's deeper than that. Once Nate (Noah Taylor) enters the picture, things begin to get a little more interesting. Does Nate really seem like the type of guy to get honorably discharged from the army, get an offer for a CIA job, and spend his time thinking it over while working at a home improvement store? You'll have to be the judge of that yourself. His admiration for Erica (Amanda Fuller) is one of the driving factors of the film though. Then Franki (Marc Senter) works his way into the equation, as well. He thought he was having a one-night stand with Erica that no one would ever know about, but it turned into something that would haunt him for the rest of his life. Franki is in a band with his three best friends that seems to be on the up-and-up while his mom is battling cancer, but things begin to go downhill at a rapid pace once Franki's girlfriend reveals she cheated on him. An unflinching drama slowly snowballs into a revenge thriller that'll jump to the next scene right when you're on the verge of cringing.

The film does a fantastic job of reeling you in and making you care about these characters over the course of its hour and forty minute duration. Amanda Fuller plays up Erica having intimacy issues to near perfection as her awkward body language and inability to fight off bursting to tears whenever a man wants to do anything more with her than have sex defines her character far more than simple words ever could. Noah Taylor's Nate is a bit of a mystery. He comes off as odd at first, but he becomes a man on a mission. He'll go to great lengths to get what he wants and his savagery along with his brutality easily makes his performance the highlight of the film. Marc Senter's disturbing and mesmerizing performance in The Lost made a fairly long-lasting impression on me. At least long enough for me to recognize him in this film. Franki is a similar character and Senter's performance is just as captivating despite how deranged his character really is.

Red White & Blue will more than likely make you go through a wide spectrum of reactions. It'll start off with a ""What the hell is this?"" that'll transition to, ""Damn, and I thought I was a jerk,"" before ending with, ""So yeah, gangbangs probably aren't a very good idea..."" The film takes an engrossing story and manages to tell it by encompassing several different genres; drama, mystery and thriller with a few horror elements for good measure. Add a fantastic cast that works as a cohesive unit that also doesn't allow for any hiccups and you've got one helluva film on your hands. Red White & Blue is some of the best storytelling to be told on film in quite some time.",1304208000,13,3710,4.550898203592815

About halfway through the movie everything comes together in horrific faction. A great revenge flick in the vein of I Spit On Your Grave.

This movie features such romantic lines as ""Have you ever buried a dog up to his head to see if he'd eat dirt?"" and ""I set my sisters Parakeet on fire"". It also is a tale of lovers where one woman spreads her love to as many men as possible and leaves them with a memento for the rest of their lives. Don't be let down though there is redeeming things about this movie such as knowing that it ends. Long,boring,and depressing with brown note ending. What makes this movie bad? Everything. What makes it good Nothing. If you like deranged unsatisfying movies you will enjoy this. Also the lead actors Acne should also have should have had been listing under the starring roles.

4596834,3,B0057JIAY2,"Red White and Blue (Simon Rumley, 2010)

Inside Simon Rumley's Red White and Blue, often lurking just below the surface, is a great film straining to be released. I'm not entirely sure what would have brought that out; there were a lot of little bits, rather than one big ice floe, that kept the great film under; some places where the script could have used some attention (there's a scene between Erica and Nate towards the end of the film's first chapter where the dialogue is just howlingly bad), a few pieces of casting that seemed just a tiny bit off, a handful of places where maybe the lighting could have been better or the sound design was a touch off. Nothing major, for the most part. It's like a really good thriller got stuck in a cloud of gnats.

The film is told in three loose ""chapters"", and follows three main characters. First is Erica (Creature's Amanda Fuller), what would have been termed in the old days a loose woman (in the extreme). She is the subject of the first chapter; after we see a few of these encounters, she meets Nate (Almost Famous' Noah Taylor), a shady character who offers her a job at a hardware megastore and slowly finds his way behind all the walls she's put up against friendship by revealing a number of his own secrets (it should be obvious within three conversations what he's getting at, but just in case you're slow on the uptake, I won't spoil it for you). The second chapter gives us Franki (The Lost's Marc Senter), the singer of a local band on the brink of stardom who we met in the opening scene (the whole band got themselves an offer from Erica, and with one exception, they all took her up on it). He has a very sick mother, we're never quite sure with what (but we know it involves chemo and him donating blood on a regular basis for her to use), and he and his now-estranged father are not at all on good terms since his father found himself a new bimbo, but otherwise, things are looking up...until he gets a piece of information that puts him, and the rest of the band, on a collision course with Erica once again, leading to the third chapter. Things get, shall we say, a little out of control.

There have been the inevitable comparisons with...a certain film. Telling you which would spoil the entire second half of the movie, so I won't (though read any other five random reviews of the film and you're bound to see it), and they are in some ways warranted  despite a major role reversal and this film going on considerably longer post-the events that invite the comparison.  But Red White and Blue is its own movie, and it's usually possible to see that very good film that this could easily have been with maybe one more rewrite, a little more attention to detail, some better pacing (I'm blaming the editing room, not the script, this time), maybe a few key personnel changes behind the camera (a really hotshot cinematographer would have done wonders here). On the other hand, it's got one of the best soundtracks since Charles Pinion's Twisted Issues, the three principals all turn in strong performances (Taylor is the best of the lot, which doesn't surprise me; he's got more experience than the other two combined), and Simon Rumley knows where to put a camera to make things work about as well as they can in any given scene. There's a good deal to like about this movie; I just saw a lot of potential throughout that was almost--but not quite--realized. That does not mean you should not see this film. Quite the opposite. This is a good thriller that could have been top-notch. ***",1362787200,,3561,4.514728682170543
4596835,5,B0057JIAY2,This film lays open raw emotions and rage on a scale way beyond anything you have probably ever seen before.,1353974400,,108,4.45
4596836,1,B0057JIAY2,"In this disjointed indie-mumbler there are two avenging angels instead of the one featured in Martin Scorsese's masterpiece.  Disturbed Vietnam War Vet Travis Bickle who wants to join the CIA is replaced in the 21st Century by Nate, a mentally unstable Iraq war veteran who's also thinking about joining the CIA.  Nate's tag team partner is Amanda ""Emily"" Fuller, instead of Jodie ""Iris"" Foster, both sexual libertine sisters with hearts of gold (sorta).  (With her apparent lack of acting talents, I can't help but wonder if Amanda is Deloris Fuller's, the star of Ed Wood Junior's `Glen Or Glenda', long lost cousin?)

The film, set in Austin, Texas, starts off slowly; becoming less sexy and more violent as the film unspools.

As we reach the last frames, of the last reel, we find poor ol' Nate (still not a CIA operative) mumbling into a small Boy Scout campfire--somewhere out in wilds of the hard-bitten Sonoran Desert.  What was our anti-hero doing out there, when he originally said he was going to take a nice blood bath in Texas and then go visit his sister in Florida?  I guess we'll have wait for the exciting sequel to find out...",1337472000,,1145,4.752525252525253
4596837,2,B0057JIAY2,"This starts out as a cool little movie well acted well scripted with something eccentric on the periferies.
I say its dangerous because it turns ethical behaviour on its head and sets it on a tight-rope .If its good if its bad. Does it allow for neither if people are more complex than they appear.? Seeing as there are a whole load of people without a lot of intellectual equipment out there its the kind of film that would set them on the slippery slope of ethical unhingement. ?Luckily this is an unusual film  and its dangerous slippery subtlety is a one-off.

Its up there as a five star film but two stars for condoning animal abuse in Nate and for an irresponsible take on wether its right for the abused to turn abuser with Erica This lack of ethics seems exploitive on part of the film makers

People seem cool and ikeable and like themselves. Hell we like em too. Terrifying what they don't see about themselves and before sayiing its justified revenge at the end don't forget he missed the inside story on venereal disease.",1334188800,,1034,4.518716577540107
4596838,4,B0057JIAY2,"This is a very provacative film on many levels. I was very impressed how emotionally impacting this film was, but I wasn't expecting any different coming from recently viewing Simon Rumley's first film ""The Living and The Dead.""  Which was equally as tragic in its portrayal of humanity's complete lack of control.  I don't want to give the story away as there are multiple arcs in character development that ultimately lead to this film's gripping ending.  A must see for anyone who enjoys feeling very uncomfortable after a viewing experience.",1324339200,,545,5.033333333333333
4596839,5,B0057JIAY2,"What makes ""Red White & Blue"" great is that it is a tale of revenge that understands.  It understands its characters, their situations, and the horror that results.  Without giving much of the plot away (less said the better), it tells the tale of multiple people and how their lives intertwine in a dark way.  Each of the main characters has his or her own story, and this film lets us into each one with intelligence and care.  There isn't anyone in here who has been untouched by some kind of emotional pain or damage, and the well written script gives insight into each one in such a way that there isn't a person we don't feel for or understand on some level.  This of course makes the darker elements of this film all the more tragic.  It's not a film for the squeamish, graphically violent at times, but at the same time it shows the perfect level of restraint in what it does show, resulting in the Hitchock effect of us imagining the worst.  Amanda Fuller's excellent turn as Erica is painful to watch in its realism, as she adeptly carries vulnerable hurt so clearly lurking beneath a hardened surface.  And Noah Taylor, given the most difficult character to play as he walks a tightrope line, is outstanding as Nate, managing to evoke both sympathy and horror in alternating seconds.  It's a haunting film that builds a bed of meditative sadness ultimately burned in cringing horror.  It won't soon leave you, and packs an emotional punch not unlike ""I Saw the Devil"" (very different film, but a good companion piece).  Brutal, touching, and tragic.",1312934400,21,1560,4.636363636363637
4596840,5,B0057JIAY2,"One of the best revenge dramas I have ever seen. Brutal and compelling and shot in the seedier parts of Austin, Texas by British director Simon Rumley on a very low budget, it's enhanced by the very fine cast (which includes some respected though not very famous actors, including Noah Taylor playing niftily against character). The movie is about essentially a love (or perhaps death) triangle: Nate, an Iraq war veteran in his thirties who looks edgy and might be somewhat disturbed and Franki, a drummer in an upcoming garage band are the men whose life is intersected through Erica, an attractive girl whose life is a mess working at odd jobs as well as the occasional gig as a prostitute. A sexually transmitted disease will unleash a terrible mayhem of death and revenge. I don't want to add more about the plot, but the results can be brutal in the extreme, even if the climactic act of violence is shot off camera. Starts somewhat slow, and it takes its time to develop its plot, but the third and final act will leave everyone speechless.",1309996800,3,1047,4.664864864864865
4596841,3,B0057JIAY2,"Some people absolutely love this flick but I'm not one of them. As a matter of fact, given the average mediocre reviews from the Amazon users, (who tend to be a kind lot) I'm trying to remember what caused me to rent this in the first place.

Here's the scoop. Erica goes around sleeping with essentially everyone. She will do so 1 time only. No relationships, names or anything else that will put her closer than arms length to anyone. She gets a job at a home improvement store where she meets the Noah Taylor character Nate. Things do change a bit for her. Then an earlier character, Franki (a rock musician) re-emerges because she has made an indelible and long lasting impression on him and everything changes for everyone involved.

As this started out I liked it a lot. I liked the characters I was meeting. Amanda Fuller does a great job as Erica. She looks like a rough-edged Ellen Page. Noah Taylor has been good in everything I've seen him in and he's no less effective here. Something didn't work for me with Marc Senter's Franki though. I'm not certain what it was but he seemed ""off."" What put me off was the hairpin turn. This starts out as Erica's story. You meet her, see what she's about and you get a whiff of where things can and might go. Then the Franki character comes back into the picture and it turns into an entirely different movie. Then something happens at the very end that threw me for a loop. Either I wasn't paying attention or this thing flew in from left field. All I can say is it left me scratching my head.

This was shot on the cheap. No fancy anything here. Just writing and acting. The music was generally good but maybe a bit over-wrought at times. This isn't a bad movie by any means and it does have a lot going for it. But unless you're into indy-type dramas, you might want to give this a pass.",1308528000,2,1841,4.3615160349854225
4596842,1,B0057JIAY2,"The greater concern with movies of this type are first, with the production studio and it's crew and what they stand for and second, with an audience that can rationalize their sadistic personalities through the usual abstract selective analysis of a film's supposed intricate qualities - acting, twists to the plot; psychological and sociological dissonance; emotional catharsis; story development, and so on.

FF summary:  It's just another torture flick in the same way (as was briefly pointed out by one of the characters in the movie) that some people, from childhood through adulthood, never come to terms with their sickness in enjoying the torture of anything weaker than themselves. The movie panders to the sadistic power of being the omnipotent viewer.",1308441600,4,763,5.297520661157025

4596844,2,B0057JIAY2,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. After thinking about it for a while though, I've come to the conclusion that this is a highly unlikeable movie...by design. Some people will be able to appreciate it on it's own terms, however these people are probably in the minority in my humble opinion.

I generally really enjoy films that are on the darker end, thematically. So after reading the synopsis and some glowing reviews, I was very excited to see this one. I sat down to watch it...and I felt like I was waiting for something deep and interesting to develop, but it never did.

Here are the two things that doomed this film for me from the start:

-An extremely unlikeable cast of main characters.

-Vague storytelling that fails to entice or invoke a sense of mystery like it's trying to.

With the above aspects in mind...everything else just failed to 'click' for me. I found that I didn't care at all what happened to these people, so when moments arised that were supposed to be thrilling and tense, they fell a little flat.

I don't doubt that a few people will find redeeming qualities here...I simply did not. Certainly not a horrible movie, I was just expecting so much more.

This is really an extraordinary film.  It takes its time to introduce the trio of main characters in cinema verite style while establishing an atmosphere of dread that makes it clear that bad things are coming.  And, boy, do they ever come.  But while each of these people is responsible for doing awful, inexcusable things to each other, they never entirely lose our sympathy because they have been presented as complete human beings and we can see how their violence is motivated by pain rather than a purely evil nature.

When the story begins with this lady who is a promiscuous one who has sex with anything that movies but doesn't do with same man and the fact that she is not even pretty really drew no attention at all and I thought that this will be a long long night.
But as time goes by it get more and more interesting and I kind of begin to be in her side.
Then there appeared this man who has eyes on her. He is a bit older then her and looks gentle, not like other men.
I think he likes her or even love her.
But he did nothing although she even have sex with a bunch of men even during the worktime in the restroom.
He just watch them what they are doing with uncomfortable gaze.
The woman realise his look, tells him that I don't keep boyfriends I don't like to have sex with you either, it was kind of mean.
But he keeps eye on her.

The story became extreme when one of the guy who's mother is getting out of cancer had a test and found out that he's got AIDS and he also tells his mother to have the same test since he gave his mother transfuse his blood.
He knew why he got this disease since there is only one woman he had sex with without a condom.
He decides to meet her and do something about it.

First it was really gentle.
He approach to her and even tries to comfort her that she also got AIDS.
But when she begins to push him out, he got violent. He even calls his rock group buddys and begins to torture her.

When his mother figures out that she got AIDS too and kills herself, he got really really mad and ends up with killing her by slise her body into pieces.

Now that the woman's admirer begins to find her since she is dissapeared, he finally traced one of the guy from the band.
One by one he brutally tortured and murders.

We as audiences thinks that the story might be about the guy who kidnaps the woman who gives the guy AIDS then suddenly the story changes into the guy who loves the woman.
Now about the guy who got AIDS, his torture shots, the director didn't shows the whole detail moments.
But the man who loves the woman, now this is a whole different story we're talking about.
It's rather very explicit and extreme.
It shows how much angry he is and these guys are totally deserves to treat that way.

After all this is a revenge movie.

This movie is not all original and the director is smart enough to use a not pretty actress and vulnerable looking bad guy, good guy look but somehow strong faced actor who will be end up with revenger and they are end up with success.

That's the point of this movie.",1463529600,,2719,4.086303939962477
