1883492,4,B00009KTYQ,"As an adult, I come to love the classics...Nothing says 1940 like a good ol' Tom and Jerry cartoon.

This series is newer, but the animators really got it right. They did a wonderful job of keeping the old look. Props to them for not churning out cheap looking animation.

This is worth it as the episodes are rather amusing. No complaints here. Kids love it and when you watch it with them, you will enjoy too.",1181952000,,411,4.324675324675325
1883493,1,B00009KTYQ,"What is WB thinking! In an era of discounting, they are charging double! A half hour video for double the price!",1117065600,12,112,4.380952380952381
1883494,2,B00009KTYQ,"It is sad that Warner Bros. has done this.  For the price a person should expect the DVD to be approximately 90 minutes in length.  (Movie price, Movie length)  Greatest Chases is a wonderful DVD and was something like 87 minutes.  Then along comes this DVD with that time cut in HALF! (But not the price)  I give it half the rating because it is half a DVD.  Send the message to Warner Bros. that we would like a WHOLE DVD by not buying this DVD.",1063756800,43,447,4.1395348837209305
1883495,3,B00009KTYQ,"There are only 7 episodes on this DVD:
The Flying Cat
The Missing Mouse
Two Little Indians
Touche' Pussy Cat
The Flying Sorceress
Is There a Doctor in the Mouse?
The Haunted Mouse
The extras are not even worth viewing, thrown together 3 minutes before they went to press.  The only good thing about it:  it is a DVD, which will play in our mini-van.  Given those facts, my 3-year-old boy loves it.  Anything ""Tom and Jerry"" and he is happy.",1063065600,30,440,4.395061728395062

7991063,5,B00009KTYQ,"I have grown up watching TOM AND JERRY cartoons and I'm quite fond of them. They're chases are just hilarious and they make quite a funny mischief when these loveable characters play with each other. I enjoyed watching TOM AND JERRY when I was a kid almost everyday and that's why I brought them home on DVD. That way I can sit back, relax, and let them put a smile on my face and also make it red with lots and lots of laughter. YOU GUYS ARE PLAIN HUMUROUS!!!
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO LOVE THEM AGAIN.",1365292800,,500,4.164948453608248

7991065,3,B00009KTYQ,"I have a halloween DVD collection going for me and my son, I was excited to see what this one was all about. One of the pro's of the DVD for me is that it was the old episodes I grew up with, not the newer series were they could talk. One of the episodes was a little later, but still what I consider classic tom and Jerry, you could tell that Chuck Jones did it(artist from the grinch), which was enjoyable. The menu includes a nice halloween them, including Jack o Lantern menu buttons, and the back of the box shows Tom and Jerry trick or treating, but there was no such episodes. There was an episode with the witch shown on the cover, and then the rest kind of stretched the theme, like the first short, tom gets tangled in a close line, and looks like a bat for a couple seconds. I picked this up for 5 dollars, so think it was worth it to add to my growing family Halloween collection.",1346112000,,892,4.102857142857143
