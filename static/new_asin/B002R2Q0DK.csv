Even though I know the story by heart, I was still swept into the drama as if it was my first time. I also had to purchase the soundtrack because you will want to listen to these songs while you are driving to work or running on the treadmill. Do yourself a favor and watch Meteor Garden and Hana Yori Dango. Can I pick a favorite version? Nope. They are all great! I also recommend the box sets of Palace, My Girl, Full House, and My Lovely Sam-Soon. This drama obsession is becoming an expensive, but awesome addiction!",1260144000,3,696,4.403100775193798
3971388,5,B002R2Q0DK,"I haven't seen such refreshing movie in a very long while and this one IS IT! It's nice to be reminded again and again of how simplicity in the midst of glitz and glamour is even more enchanting (as in the case of Jan Di); innocence, decency and determination can and will always capture ones heart! and the beauty of love and sacrifice between true loyal friends...amazing! Just try to overlook their vanity....the acting is outstanding! You'll laugh a lot, cry a little...it'll move you! It's a pleasant distraction as you'd be glued in your seat to the end! A wonderful entertainment for the young ones and once...young. Buy one! or better yet...give one!",1256601600,17,658,4.780701754385965
3971389,5,B002R2Q0DK,"This was to be a gift for my girlfriend for her birthday. She secretly found out about it from her mom however but she was still really surprised that I got it for her. :D This was her first k-drama and I knew she would love to have it.

The box set is really nice and has a cool little art booklet inside volume 1. It's secured pretty well since it's sealed by magnets rather than regular dvd cases. Also it looks really nice on a widescreen. :p

My girlfriend loves the design and the accurate subtitles. She watched a lot of it for her birthday.

5 STARS! :D",1342742400,,561,4.128440366972477
3971390,5,B002R2Q0DK,"Boys Over Flowers is based on the hugely popular Japanese Manga, Hana Yori Dango, by Yoko Kamio. The Korean TV adaptation dominated the ratings.  This K-Drama will make you laugh, cry, and root for the underdog.  Jandi is a brave (and poor) high school girl who hates bullies and will fight for the rights of others no matter the cost. When she defends her only school friend from the elite Boys of F4's (Flower 4) abuse, Jandi becomes their next victim. She fights back and soon wins the admiration of the extravagantly wealthy boys.  This is a GREAT show!  The characters/actors are solid.  The relationships between spunky Jandi, Junpyo (the ruthless leader of the F4), and the kind-hearted yet aloof Jihoo will keep you riding on an emotional roller coaster.  The packaging of the series is fabulous!  I was actually shocked with how nice the presentation/layout of the discs was (sturdy box to hold discs with photo album inside).  Such a great buy.  Well worth it!!!  This series will make you laugh and cry so have tissues nearby.  Also, there are many unexpected twists in the story so the viewer is never bored. And if you've never seen a K-Drama before, this one will make you become an addict.  Once you watch Boys Over Flowers (the entire series), you WILL watch it again and again.  I sure have and it gets even better each time.

This review is for the YA Entertainment Studio Version of the Korean Series Boys Over Flowers.  Subtitles are excellent (easy to read, few grammar errors).  Picture quality is amazing.",1341878400,5,1528,4.731060606060606
3971391,5,B002R2Q0DK,"I love this series! So much that both my younger sister and my mom have fallen in love with it. My sister and I have fallen in love with Kim Hyun Joong (Ji Hoo) and my mom with Lee Min Ho (Jun Pyo). What we didn't like was the ending. I have read the manga and it kinda similar to the drama just a few things change such as Yi Jung is a potter and in the manga he does tea ceremony. Also in the manga Makino (Jan Di) has her best friend who goes to the same school as her but in the drama her best friend is just Gael. But overall I love this, I have laughed and cried and felt so but for Ji Hoo, he did everything for her and she still choose Jun Pyo. I give a rating of 200%. Long live Korean dramas!",1341792000,,702,3.7181208053691277
3971392,2,B002R2Q0DK,"I want to make it very clear that this review isn't for the show itself, but the actual dvd set.  This series is AWESOME, which is why it was the first K-Drama I bought.  What's wrong with it is the subtitles are not good.  True, there are no misspellings or grammatical errors, but the subtitles we receive are a condensed version of what is actually being spoken.  Its not too hard to figure out that there is more dialogue being spoken than is actually being translated.  I recognize Korean is a difficult language to translate because there is so much meaning conveyed in how words are spoken rather than the actual words themselves, however there are better versions available. Drama Fever has much more involved subtitles that show how much we have lost in this dumbed-down set.  Unfortunately, I can't find it on dvd, which is disappointing because otherwise this series would be perfect.",1341446400,2,895,4.779220779220779
3971393,5,B002R2Q0DK,"Since I started this tv drama I have not been able to get enought! At first I did not think I would like it, but even though I have to read subtitles, I cannot stop watching it over and over again!

3971394,5,B002R2Q0DK,"Definitely believe the hype!!! This is one of the best Korean Dramas to watch out there. One of the main reasons why everyone seems to love the drama (besides the cute guys in here of course) is that from the first minute of the first episode until the last minute of the last episode in Season 2, it's literally entertaining. Usually most dramas drag and are redundant in their story lines but from beginning to end it was so much fun to watch! Just one episode is full of laughs, romance, cuteness, and angry emotions that make you emotional and each of the guys, especially Lee Min Ho is so adorable to watch. Everyone seems to have a favorite guy in the show and talking among this drama with my friends is always fun. Definitely watch Lee Min Ho in City Hunter as well. You can see how different his role is to Boys Over Flowers and that he's not just a 'cutesy' actor. :)",1336608000,2,877,4.321212121212121

3971403,5,B002R2Q0DK,"This was a fabulous drama and I absolutely loved it. I started watching just to see if it was any good and then boom! I was completely and utterly hooked. I enjoyed it tremendously--I cheered for every bit of drama and melodrama. It was so good I could over come the sappy music and cheesy hairstyles. In fact, to those things I say ""bring it on!"" By the end I loved it all. I feel in good conscience I should warn people that it is really, really hard to not turn to the next episode.

Not all K dramas have good endings, or rather, they don't have fitting ones, and as you enter into the home strech you end up wincing in horror as it spirals down into something awful. But in this one you're in excellent hands. The resolution is satisfying. The heroine is someone you can cheer for and do. It's a must watch. My only regret is that I can't be new to watching this again.",1316476800,2,874,4.171597633136095

I didn't really care about the photobook, so I was really torn. In the end, I decided to pay the extra money for this one and it was really worth it.

I am so inspired by Jandi's character. What a beautiful heart she has! I told my mother about it and she was reluctant to view a teenage show. She was hooked with the first episode and after the end of each episode she'd say, ""Next!"". Hahaha. We watched all of the episodes of volume 1 in two days!

He is the most handsome of all the boys yet he is very feminine. The casting is very applaudable. Seldom we see a person with so much talent, and that is what I like with Korean dramas. The guys in here are fully loaded with talents. They can play instruments, can sing, plays different sports. I recommend this one to those who are hopelessly romantic, who loves happy ending, and who still believes that there's still equality in this crazy world.",1291766400,,583,4.3577981651376145

3971413,5,B002R2Q0DK,"Boys over flowers is a mega hit in Korea then became a worldwide household name in the whole Asia in 2009. The storyline was based on a japanese manga comics about a poor girl going into an elite school and meeting the elite snobbish group of four guys called the F4. Because of her integrity she managed to befriend the F4 and started to hang out with them. The leader of the F4 started to like her and soon enough they became a couple. This box set will explain how Jandi befriends the snobbish F4 and how she manages to fall in love with Jihoo, another member of F4, while Junpyo became in love with her. This exciting love triangle will test both jihoo and junpyo of their skills to win Jandi's heart. Who will she pick in the end? Jihoo or Junpyo?  Who does jandi really love? Is it jihoo or junpyo...

He's so dreamy! I've watched this drama five times already and I don't get tired of it. So if you're reading this, that means you've heard about this drama and should probably watch it.

3971418,3,B002R2Q0DK,"First off, I absolutely adored this drama. It had its flaws and ran on a bit, but it was a delight to watch and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys kdramas. That said, I first watched a fansubbed version of this right after it had wrapped in Korea and while the subtitles were well done, I wanted an ""official"" region 1 version for my collection. Imagine my excitement when it became available! I bought both vol. 1 and vol. 2. The packaging is great, vol. 1 includes a lovely photobook of the F4 and Jan Di, the disk quality is great, and the subttles are OK (there are some discrepancies, i.e some names are not quite what they should be), but there is one MAJOR difference from the fansubbed version--the backround music is different! So BE WARNED! If you watched the original Korean release with fansubs, all the backround music from the O.S.T. is completely different. Usually things like this  don't bother me and if you've never seen any other version of this you won't notice, but the original songs in the backround were really catchy ones performed by some great Kpop groups! For me, the different music really changes the mood of some of the scenes. I'm sure the original songs are not included due to liscensing issues or some such legal mumbo jumbo, but it kind of sucks for us, who have shelled out quite a bit cash and expected to get the original TV show with its original soundtrack and found that that is not the case. Oh well, all gripes aside, for those who are interested in watching this show for the first time--I highly recommend it. It had its silly eye rolling moments, but the cast (especially the F4 boys) were lovey to watch and the story was very entertaing. But if you are like me and have seen it before and just wanted to add it to your collection--I warn you now, changes have been made.",1261872000,80,1827,4.470059880239521

I'm a disabled paramedic and in a wheelchair some of the time due to my injury. I'm on my third trip through Heirs, Boys over Flowers. Inherit the Sun, Anything I can find with these characters. Any coming to the states soon? What's a good website to follow all four men on their journey through their characters with well written scripts and phenomenal acting.
My whole family watches this and it's so much better even for little ones to watch. Just goes to show you that great movies and dramas don't need sex, drugs, cheating spouses or any of the R-X rated stuff in American TV and movies. Y'all very much know how to write a script and pick fantastic people to act out anything cleanly and family oriented. Id love to hear them sing or come over there and watch a shoot scenes etc. Keep making these awesome shows. I'm waiting on 2nd seasons for these as well as ""Inherent the Sun"".

The writer plays with your heartstrings taking the viewer on an emotional journey of heartache, joy, envy, and hope. The love triangle between Goo Junpyo, Geum Jandi, and Yun Jihoo is timeless. If you're a female, you will find Jandi's tenacity, bluntness, and cuteness endearing-only wishing you had guys fighting and protecting you like this. How do I know this will go down as a classic series...I got my mother hooked and she is hard to please people. Every time Yun Jihoo came on the screen she turn to mush like a lovesick teenager.
