211902,5,6300181227,"This full lengh Dragnet film was made in 1954.  The actors included Jack Webb as Sgt Friday, Ben Alexander as Frank Smith and Richard Boone as the captain.  I have always believed that the original series which aired in the 1950's was the better of the Dragnet films.  In this film, Friday and Smith are up against the mob.  The acting is superb and the plot is well done.  The story moves along quite well and there is some great character performances.  The viewer will be intrigued by the settings in 1950's Los Angeles.  The old cars, the trolley cars moving along Wilshire Boulivard and ever prominent tough LA cops.  It is a great trip down memory lane.  The film has a great ending.  I would recomend this film for anyone who is a fan of Jack Webb and Dragnet.",1005609600,8,767,4.414285714285715

211920,3,6300181227,"This is a review of the 1954 movie, not the TV series.  This is a ""vault series"" disc, much like the Warner collection ""on demand"" discs, there are no extras and worst of all no subtitles.  Luckily if you blast the sound up you can hear the dialogue since in those days actors spoke clearly.  It starts with a brutal killing (of an uncredited Dub Taylor) and then the police procedural begins.  This is not real exciting, but if you've seen the TV series you know what to expect.  The most bizarre scene to me is when Friday and a partner talk to a ""hip"" cat who looks to be over 40, and I suppose represents a beatnik.  There is an extended fight scene which becomes almost comical. Friday is abused by criminal suspects, but never beats them up.  In short, it is good, but rather dull.  This was directed by Jack Webb --- I recommend watching his other self-directed movie, the D.I. instead.",1448323200,,893,4.402439024390244

Gangland hits, intimidated witnesses, the Fifth Amendment: they are all here.  Although the policewoman's role was a supporting one, the character was treated with dignity by her peers.

(I'm still waiting for Willie to appear) The movie still has all of the shock that it had when I saw it on TV chopped to death by commercials. Yet, the biggest difference between this Dragnet movie in 1954 and the Dragnet pilot movie that Jack Webb did in 1966 shows how the techniques of police work changed and some say for the better. It was all due to Miranda of course. Yet what gets me about this movie overall is how funny it was in delivery of many of the lines. It has one of my favorite sequences of all Dragnet set-ups when Stacy harris, Web and Ben Alexander all go in the diner and order ""hot milk"". That is a riot. What truly remains though is how Webb always wanted accuracy, from the dialogue to the sets and everything in between. It receives my highest recommend and it's a great place to start if you're unfamiliar with Jack Webb, Dragnet and anything related. Oh if Webb had only managed to Dragnet in the mid-80's.

Friday and Smith do some fist fighting with the criminals in this and there is some blood splattered around (one guy goes through a window) so it has some tame violence that was present in the early TV episodes and absent from later episodes.  It is long on police techniques from the period (some of which are illegal now) and a disappointing ending for the cops.

212047,5,6300181227,"Not sure why the reviews for this Dragnet (1954) full length feature movie are all about a DVD with multiple episodes of the TV show?
Anyway, I just rented and watched ""Dragnet (1954)"" instant video. This is the full length feature movie that was released in 1954 in color and what this review is written about. (that is the movie which is listed above).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragnet-1954/dp/B000I9TY00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragnet (1954)</a>

I am not sure but I would guess that this movie was released in theaters and also on TV at the same time to coincide with the new color TV's that were just introduced that same year in March of 1954 by Westinghouse with model H840CK15 and April 1954 by RCA with model CT-100. I would guess that this was also released in theaters as well as TV because at the time color TV was brand new and very expensive with a small audience. The new Westinghouse H840CK15 retailed for $1,295 and the RCA CT-100 was $1000, that is 1954 dollars!

I mention all that to put the release of this movie in perspective and to say that is what makes watching this movie so great! I am a big fan of Dragnet and have seen every original black and white TV episode that is in the public domain on the internet archive as well as listened to many of the over 300 original radio series episodes also available free on the internet archive.
Seeing everything in color including; the cars, neon lights and signs, city hall police department, and all the clothing including suits (grey or tweed with colored ties) and women's dresses made me feel like I was in a time capsule seeing what life was really like in the 1950's, and more importantly what things really looked like in the original Dragnet series, if it had been in color.
Boy, people knew how to dress then, and we have surly lost something.

I won't put in any spoilers and tell the story but the story has an emphasis on ""pounding the pavement"" and following up many dead end leads highlighting the hard police work that Jack Webb always wanted to convey to his watchers. It is not at all a cut and dry case, and at first I was a little surprised Jack picked this story to make into a full length film. There were TV episodes that were far more dramatic and climactic that he could have used, but the more I thought about Jack Webb and how he loved to promote the hard work of the police to the public without all the glamour it really makes sense he chose this story.

It is well worth watching and I would highly recommend it to any Dragnet fan, if not only just to see it in color!",1359417600,3,2622,4.584221748400853

in 1954.  It was a big deal - not
because I really liked DRAGNET all that much (I didn't),
but because I'd read there was a good
fight scene in it.

Sitting in that cavernous theater, dwarfed
by all those Jack Webb fans surrounding me,
I found myself caught up from the very first when
the shotgun killer rose up from behind a low hill
and blasted some guy into manburger at point blank range.

This was a different, more brutal DRAGNET.
Detective Joe Friday was unrestrained, obsessive.
This being long before the Miranda directive
re how supposed criminals were to be treated by the police,
Friday's deliberate persecution of the
main bad guy was amazing.  Civil liberties?  What civil liberties?

His companion Ben Alexander didn't have much to do;
policewoman Ann Robinson(WAR OF THE WORLDS) survived being placed in harm's way.
And smooth-faced Richard Boone - Friday's agreeable, soft-spoken
boss - didn't seem too worried about ""excessive"" police
methods.

A cool procedural about early 50s cops doing their
stuff, directed by Jack Webb in a ""no nonsense pantyhose"" style.
And yes! the fight scene at an upstairs card game was great, if brief.

Technology's allowed me to watch many (maybe all?) of the black & white versions and I've listened to almost all of the available radio episodes. I love this show but I hadn't seen the 1954 movie. In fact I didn't even know about it until recently.

The plot is much like the Dragnet episodes but strung out longer to be able to comprise a full movie rather than just a 30-minute TV episode. There's a killing of a ""small time hood"" in an LA park so Friday and Smith have to investigate and find the killer. The dialogue is what you'd expect from the 50s black & white version. Jack Webb's character Joe Friday narrates and has a few rants against suspects too. The movie makes use of technology like a mini tape recorder that was probably very new to movie goers in the 1950s. Seeing how they used technology that was brand new 60 years ago but is hopelessly outdated now is fun.

From the stand-point of establishing new meaning --- and perhaps arguably for the first time --- this film takes on the task of exploring the criminal investigative work performed by police and other components of the ""Law and Order"" system; while the themes that Jack Webb took time to offer, in personal detail, are what we may now take for granted. Yet, he was the one Actor/Director that broke new ground in this film, via his Mark VII Ltd. production company, to be in the unchartered vanguard of a concerned private citizen, creating public awareness of the difficulties in being ""a cop"" --- Sergeant Joe Friday.

When this film was release by Warner Brothers on September 4, 1954 --- as a theatrical release for public movie fans --- audiences were invited into the backrooms of the Los Angeles Police Department and Criminal Justice system.  The composite challenges of how an investigation of a mob-related killing take place (from the eyes of the police) is exposed; starting from basic information in the crime lab, to field investigations, undercover work, interactive legalities in the L.A. District Attorney's Office, testimony with the L.A. County Grand Jury, to signed Warrants of Arrest --- so it has its own purpose --- unlike the TV episodes that provided entertainment for general attention spans --- to inform the public, beyond passive cinematic distraction and entertainment.  Along these lines, it succeeds and, therefore, may stand isolated and alone (yet on its own merits); and perhaps unfairly compared to the television genre that provided more off-the-cuff humor.

While this film's main purpose may have succeeded in taking the time to open the doors to the L.A. Criminal Justice system (as here-to-fore never before seen by the public-at-large in 1954); it also establishes the legendary template by Jack Webb as giving ""just the facts"".  In so doing, Jack Webb set his own mark in establishing respect for law and order, when perhaps it was (and still is) taken for granted.",1324944000,3,2266,5.061662198391421

212075,5,6300181227,"Dragnet, 1954 film

On a Friday afternoon Sgt. Joe Friday and the police talk about the recent daylight murder in a park. The physical evidence tells what happened. Two men walked into a park and one was shot in ambush. The police check the suspects. The Intelligence Department keeps track of criminals. Suspects are brought in to a hotel for questioning in privacy. These rooms are bugged. A note from the victim has a telephone number for a suspect, Max Troy. He is uncooperative. Sgt. Friday questions him. Troy suggests the victim was involved with the wrong woman. The conversation is interesting, and unusual these days. Suspects were kept and questioned for unlimited times without a lawyer present. They hear about an eyewitness, he looks at pictures and picks out the man he saw leaving that field. The detectives visit the ""Red Spot"" caf to check on alibis. Writs of Habeas Corpus are issued to free the suspects.

A policewoman will work undercover with a miniature wire recorder. Its about the size of a paperback novel. The murder scene is searched with test equipment. ""Why does the law always work for the guilty?"" ""The innocent don't need it."" Friday and Smith visit a restaurant. The murder victim used to collect debts for Las Vegas gamblers. He was beaten up a month ago, a warning? They talk to Miller Starkie's wife, she doesn't say much except to mention ""Max Troy"". She hands them a notebook, then walks them to the door. Friday and Smith begin to check out those names. One is a theatrical producer. ""But she can't sing."" They get a clue that Miller Starkie was holding out. The telephone company gives up a list of long-distance calls made by the suspects. [No court order?] That recording provides information. They learn that Chester Davit has been found. He walks out of his home to the police. His right shoe matched the exemplar.

Friday and Smith visit the museum. The eyewitness is now hesitant about his identification. The Grand Jury meets. Sgt. Friday testifies about the telephone calls. What do they know about the conversations? There was no indictment; not enough evidence without that eyewitness. The suspects are followed around the clock. We see this technique working. People stop to watch. [Note the pack of Chesterfields cigarettes.] ""Goodnight Max."" Friday and Smith visit a social club. There is a fist fight; blood flows. The police put a bug in the ""Red Spot"" office. They find a box of discarded 12-gauge shells. Four shells missing! Later they listen to a ""Red Spot"" telephone call and learn about Davit. This recording is played for a witness, who gives information about the missing shotgun, and where it was bought. The District Attorney now says ""you got him"". Will the suspect be arrested now? A technicality prevents the arrest for an ironic ending.

""Dragnet"", first a radio show then a TV show, was a big hit in the early 1950s. It pioneered the programs which produced details about police procedures. There was not much dramatic action, rarely shooting and violence. ""Just the facts, ma'am."" Jack Webb was a lab technician in the movie ""He Walked by Night"" which was based on a true crime. It was unlike the earlier ""film noir"" movies which were based on personal emotion. The series of ""CSI"" TV shows show the audience the work behind the scenes. Some say the techniques shown on ""CSI"" are very dramatic and do not represent actual reality. That is also true about the profiling (an educated guess) shown on TV (""Criminal Minds"").

Additionally, this is police work from the pre-miranda rights era therefore, the movie becomes a historical documentary on mid-fifties police procedures.

It's Sergeant Friday in a show that mixes Dragnet with the fast-paced Noir writing that made Webb's Private Detective show, Pat Novak for Hire (written by screenwriter Richard Breen,) a classic.

1) Picture Quality was superb: I've seen this on an old rental VHS and the difference is night and day. The color is crisp and stunning. This is a good print that Universal used.

2) The Story is not your ordinary Dragnet. This film would be considered a minor noir classic if it weren't based on a TV show. In many ways it deviates with a fist fight in a bridge hall and the lack of banter between Friday and Smith. As well, Friday is a little more aggressive and on-edge than normally written. This is because Breen didn't write for Dragnet. It's very similar to the normal Dragnet, but with a greater hard boiled punch to it that makes it interesting. It also fits that Friday would be a little tougher as he's dealing with underworld hoods throughout the whole thing, and not Mrs. Garrity, the grey-haired landlady. Just because it's different, doesn't make it bad or unfitting for the canon. It's actually a well-made and distinct film.

3) The Dialogue is a Work of Art. This is Friday at his toughest, delivering lines such as, ""Unless you're growin', Sit down! "" to a hood trying to start something.

Friday is tough and ready for action in a forgotten classic that is a must see for fans of Dragnet, NOIR, or detective fiction.",1274832000,19,1525,4.575091575091575

Directed by creator/writer/star Jack Webb, the film, like the TV and Radio shows before it, show the real-life work of a big-city Police Force.
This film, in a move very unusual for 1954, opens with a shotgun blast trained right at the viewer--an image that was decried at the time but seems tame today.
The stylized acting and dialogue play as old-fashioned, but the mystery at the heart of the film works and the characters are well drawn.

Even the opticals (fade-ins, fade-outs and dissolves between scenes, accomplished by re-photographing the original negative) are in better shape than is often seen in films of this vintage. While the film itself isn't quite all I'd hoped it would be - for one thing, I was wishing for less back lot photography and more on location - there's plenty to drink in if you appreciate time-capsule looks into early-fifties culture: the clothes, the cars, the technology, all in color.

it's 60's reincarnation.  As a wise guy ever so hip teenager, Sgt. Friday, with his straight talking lectures to hippies and pot heads
seemed hilariously square. And yet I liked the show's simple format(which
became ridiculous on its spin-off Adam-12, when a radio call would invariably feature a close-up of the car radio speaker!) and the sometimes gitty realism.  Watching the re-runs 30 years later, it seems
a real museum peice.  Not so, the 50's version.  The shows are like the
raw material you imagine other film makers using to create the film noirs so popular in the 40's and 50's.  The crimes are mostly real police blotter stuff, day to day petty crimes, sad sack dead-end characters abound - most of the shows on these discs are utterly lacking in glamor.  Often, LA appears to be the armpit of the universe.
  These two  DVDs are a terrific bargain.  The other reviews have detailed what they contain and I echo the writers who are frustrated that so few Dragnets are commercially available.  The transfers are as good as a TV re-run from that era - I was pleasantly surprises they are as good as they are, considering the price.  So far, I've seen about a dozen of the 20 episodes and haven't been disappointed.  I was especially
tickled by the one where pot crazed teens trashed a movie house.  If onlythe 1952 Sgt. Friday knew what was in store for him 15 years later!",1219968000,,1459,4.626459143968872

Anyway, there are surprises:I spotted 2 ancient Fords,a '53 Buick, maybe even a DeSoto. Richard Boone plays his police role much better than he was later to play ""Paladin"".Everybody, everybody smokes. The colorization is comical at best, with blue and brown color contrasts actually distracting the viewer. The story could have been done on television in a regular half hour segment. It's a wonder to this reviewer that the series wasn't canned immediately after this abomination; yet it went on until 1959, then made a comeback in the late 60's.

Aside from that, (and the fact it's not available on DVD), this is an AWESOME movie for Dragnet fans.  That is, for fans of the ORIGINAL Dragnet (1951).  Joe Friday is a little bit rougher than the clean-cut model of decency who crossed the TV screen in the late 1960s.  Here we have a tough, hard-hitting crime fighter who is not afraid to push some serious boundaries to get the job done (and it's stuff you could NEVER get away with today).  But - no spoiling! - you've got to see it to believe it.

A bonus for those who grew up seeing the broadcast TV version is that this is a COMPLETE version (there were several scenes cut from the broadcast version - some of which are critical to the plot).  But once again - no spoiling - you'll have to see it yourself.

The 1950s version is grittier, more true-to-life, and even more ""no-nonsense"" than the later series.  The black-and-white photography makes everything look downbeat and harder, and truly portrays the underside of society, rather than sunny Los Angeles.  It's detectives in hats, records in pen and ink, milk in bottles, and cigarettes everywhere. High-tech means sending out a ""radiogram.""  You don't get Friday lecturing hippies, but the 1950s series is, in my opinion, better.

I have many original Dragnet episodes on VHS, but this DVD set is quite a buy.  Although some of the episodes have incorrect titles, you cannot beat the price.  Fans of the 1960s series will enjoy seeing a rather young Virginia Gregg, a very young Peggy Webber, as well as Art Gilmore, Harry Bartell, a very young Bill Boyett (Sgt. MacDonald on Adam-12), Natalie Masters and assorted other actors who formed Jack Webb's unofficial company of players.  There are some classic episodes here.

I noticed that one reviewer posted the list of episodes that you get in this set, but here is a brief explanation of each of them:

Disk 1, Side A

1. The Big September -- A woman is murdered by a religious fanatic.
2. The Big Seventeen -- Episode starts with the destruction of a movie theatre by kids on drugs.  The 17-year old in question ruins his life by taking heroin.  (Note: this boy would have been born in 1935 -- long before the hippie generation.  Webb tackled drug use long before it was commonplace.)
3. The Big Show (should really be the ""Big Secret"") -- a young Virginia Gregg plays the wife of an army officer.  While taking an interstate bus trip, a young woman handed the officer's wife a baby, and said she would be back.  When the young mother did not arrive, Friday and Smith investigate.  This is one of the best episodes on this DVD set.  A must watch!
4. The Big Break -- A guy arrested for robbery breaks out of county jail and then an army jail.  Lots of action in this episode.
5. The Big Hands -- A woman's body is found in a hotel room.  Friday and Smith have to find out who she is, who killed her, and why.  A young Olan Soule is a lab technician, a role that he would reprise in the 1960s Dragnets.

Disc 1, Side B

1. The Big Betty -- Thieves scan the obituary columns, then sell relatives of the deceased worthless merchandise.  The last crook is nabbed at a New Year's Eve party. Classic lines:  Crook: Evey year, New Year's Eve, I cry.  Never had any reason for it.  Friday: You're going to have one this year, lady.
2. The Big Thief -- A couple of crooks were robbing doctors at hotels. This is the most personal episode, as it shows Friday's reaction to killing a suspect, and his girlfriend comforts him. One of the best episodes in the DVD set!
3. The Big Little Jesus -- Those who have seen the 1960s series will recognize this one, as the 1960s version was just redone in color.  A baby Jesus is missing from the oldest downtown church.  Harry Bartell plays the priest.
4. The Big Trunk (really, the Big Bird)-- a burglar breaks into homes in new developments in the San Fernando Valley (which you can buy for $500 down!) and kills any pet birds he finds.  Classic lines:  Crook: I don't feel sorry for something just 'cause it's locked up.  Friday (snapping on the handcuffs): You might.
5. The Big Boys -- Four boys, including a very young Leonard Nimoy, go on a robbery spree.

Disc 2, Side A

1. The Big Shoplift -- The detectives investigate a series of shoplifts of department stores.  A young Peggy Webber plays a doctor's wife.
2. The Big Hit-Run Killer -- An elderly woman and her grandson are killed by a hit-and-run driver.  With few clues, Friday must track down who it is.
3. The Big Girls -- Motorists are being robbed by different large, attractive women. Friday and Smith get the case.
4. The Big Frame -- Friday and Smith track down the killer of a man who apparently had died in a hit-and-run -- or was there another cause of the death?  And who had killed him?  The victim's girlfriend is played by a very young Carolyn Jones.
5. The Big Producer -- A very young Martin Milner (Malloy on Adam-12) peddles pornographic photos to his high school friends; Friday then has to find and arrest the producer of pornographic movies.  I'm surprised this was shown on TV in 1952.

Disc 2, Side B

1. The Big Crime -- This was indeed a big crime.  Two four-year-old twin girls were kidnapped and sexually molested.  Again, it is amazing that this was shown on TV in the early 1950s.
2. The Big Pair (should be ""The Big Housekeeping"") -- A couple completely strip homes of their furnishings while the owners are on vacation.
3. The Big Bar -- A killer keeps murdering bar owners.  He has the unusual habit of playing one song over and over on the juke box.
4. The Big War -- Friday tries to prevent a juvenile gang war.  The episode features Natalie Masters as a doting mother who refuses to believe her darling son could be up to any trouble.  This is a role she would repeat in the 1960s Dragnet series.
5. The Big Oskar -- A man comes into the police station claiming that he knows where stolen goods are and who stole them.

This is a great deal.  I only wish they would bring out all the black and white episodes on DVD, season by season.",1130025600,46,5365,4.454358974358974

of them are the best possible without pure digital restoration.

Quite frankly, the stories, the acting, and the reality of what police life was like in the 50's is outstanding.  I think that the best lesson that can be learned from these episodes is the difference of police work then, as opposed to now.  Cops back then had the power to keep the peace.  Some of the things that ""Friday"" does in this collection would be politically incorrect in todays world.  It's refreshing to see exciting gun fights break out with a shoot to kill attitude!

212157,5,6300181227,"For years, THE police show on television was none other than ""Dragnet."" As a kid I caught the original series in syndication and was immediately hooked. I loved the Dragnet comeback in the 60s, but was disappointed in that it went from strict crime solving to a cultural critique was was often unintentionally funny. I would often ask whatever happened to the original. It waasn't long before I found out: being in the Land of B/W, it was to be forever lost in the Brave New World of Color. Every now and then, a couple of episodes would be released on DVD, usually the same episodes. To someone discovering them for the first time, it would seem beyond the pale that 276 30-minute episodes were filmed between 1950 and 1959.

This 20-episode collection of ""Dragnet"" is a good start, bringing back the flavor and impact of the original. The technicalities aren't the greatest -- some episodes were shown as ""Badge 714"", the syndicaion title. But Who Cares?? They're all watchable, and enjoyable. Fans of the 60s version will find much to see in these earlier episodes. The perfection of the staccato dialogue (""How's that?"" ""I see."" Stick to the facts.""), the development or lack thereof in Friday's character, many of the regulars that populated the 60s version (Stacey Harris, Virginia Gregg, Peggy Webber), stars-in-the-making in early roles (Leonard Nimoy, Carolyn Jones), and the similarotoes between Officer Frank Smith (Ben Alexander) and Officer Frank Gannon (Harry Morgan.

All in all, this package is a great start, what with 20 episodes for a good price. Perhaps tohse in production should take note and begin to release this cult classic by season, as is done with many other shows. For unlike many other shows, this one deserves the comprehensive treatment.",1117065600,9,1770,4.956228956228956
212158,4,6300181227,"I found this 2 disc set of 20 Dragnet episodes very enjoyable.  The quality ranges from fair to very good, as some episodes show more wear and tear, grain, and scratches than others, especially ""The Big Show"", which has some print damage early on in the show.  All the episodes are watchable and most of them are in very good shape, showing crystal clear images, but as in good shape as some of these episodes are, I doubt these were remastered, ""in Virtual 5.1"", as it states on the back of the DVD.  However, for $11.66 + tax (which is what I paid for it at Wal-Mart) it's more than worth the money, as 20 divided by the price  comes out to 58 cents an episode!. The stories, while somewhat dated today,  are very entertaining, all the more so because they are based on true cases. Jack Webb's direction is excellent and his actors were very natural in their performances.  Check out some very famous people in some of these episodes, among them Martin Milner in ""The Big Producer"", Leonard Nimoy  in ""The Big Boys""  Carolyn Jones, later Mortica on ""The Addams Family"", in ""The Big Girl"", ""The Big Frame"" and ""The Big Producer"", and finally, Dennis Weaver shows up in ""The Big Bar"" as a forensic pathologist!. By the way, the episode ""The Big Trunk"" was mislabelled on the DVD and menu actually is ""The Big Bird"".  Despite all of this though,  I would still  highly recommend  this DVD to others with an interest in Dragnet and how crime was fought in the 1950's.  Finally, I feel that these Dragnet episodes should be digitally restored as Dragnet was a landmark TV series which inspired shows like ""Adam 12"" and ""Emergency"", (both created by Jack Webb) as well as  ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""Law & Order"" .",1080432000,7,1708,4.521172638436482

That's just one of the great lines from this, the first full length Dragnet movie. It captures Jack Webb at his fast-talking best, withering crooks and witnesses alike with his famous comebacks.
""What would you do if you were me?""
""Can I wait a while - before I'm YOU?""
Or this gem:
""Sit down!""
""I'm lookin' for an ashtray!""
""You got one!""
At which point the suspect uses his hand to catch the ashes.
Then there's this:
""How'd you like your stomach all sewn together with platinum wire?""
""I'm a policeman, I can't afford platinum.""
But he has a heart too. When he comes to the apartment of the victim's widow, he sees that not only is she a below-the-leg amputee (well, she tucks her leg underneath her skirt), but that she's also been hitting the bottle out of grief. She drops the glass and asks, ""did it break?""
""Yes ma'am, it has a hole in it,"" responds Friday, pointing at the opening in the top of the glass.
There's another hilarious moment when Friday and Smith visit a talent agent who's listening to a hopeful young singer. Her song is called ""Way down south, in South America.""
If memory serves, some of the lines are:
""Where you can rent a cabana.
You can eat a banana""
That's priceless stuff, and should be enough by itself to convince anyone to buy this movie! Overall, this movie is vastly entertaining and proves that Jack Webb definitely had a sense of humor, despite his ultra-serious on-screen demeanor, and it's one of my all time favorites....",1071878400,4,1519,4.5677655677655675
212162,5,6300181227,"While there are numerous DVDs with public domain episodes of the original Dragnet television series on the market today, this set (from Brentwood Home Video) is the one to get.  Here's why . . .
1. Quantity - The 20 episodes included on this set represent the largest single collection of original Dragnet episodes released to date (August 2003).
2. Price/Value - At a retail of [$$ it is amazing].
3. Variety - There are some very well-known (and ""common"") episodes included like The Big Seventeen and The Big Producer, but there are some rarer episodes and one, The Big Frame, has not previously appeared on DVD.

My five star rating is closer to four & one-half stars as this collection is not ""problem free.""  While all of the episodes range, visually, from fair to very good, there has been no digital restoration of the prints utilized for this collection.  All episodes are watchable, just don't expect to see pristine prints . . . you can expect some film scratches and specks.  Audio is very good on almost all of the episodes.  The episode ""The Big War"" is of noticeably lesser visual quality than the other episodes.  There are no DVD ""extras,"" but you can access individual episodes through a menu option.  What shines through on this set is the brilliance of Jack Webb . . . even though most of the episodes were made 50 years ago, the documentary style approach that Webb employed to tell these stories is still better than most of today's television police shows.  Highly recommended!!!",1061769600,107,2194,4.410891089108911

It had its great moments, like when Jack Webb fights, which is hilarious even though it's not supposed to be. I recommend this movie highly if you're a fan of the TV show, as the 1980s spoof with Tom Hanks just ruins the whole seriousness of the show.",1052438400,4,409,4.125

These have all the feel of public domain shows with varying unrestored picture and varying volume on different episodes. Going in to it knowing that, these are very watchable, enjoyable shows. Myself I prefer the old 50's era episodes to the modern color incarnation of the show, before Miranda and laws we take for granted now. It's surprising how many episodes end by say, So and So was executed in the lethal gas chamber, as their punishment.
My only real complaint is the two sided discs. I have had bad luck with them in the past, and sometimes one of these doesn't want to read.",1520121600,,723,4.443609022556391

This is in Warner Color and very well done. Jack Webb also directed it and he did his best to have angles and shadows add to the feel and movement of the movie. The plot is first rate. Added bonus are the Gangsters who are very dislikable and need to get what is coming to them. This moves pretty well. You have to pay attention to the plot because every suspect is a career criminal. 5 STARS~ Look for Richard Boone as the Captain of Police and in a very minor role Dennis Weaver as detective.",1494201600,,972,4.0890052356020945

7803643,5,6300181227,"of the two incarnations of Dragnet overseen by star/creator Jack Webb, the earlier is occasionally declared the better on the grounds that it's ""grittier,"" but i'm not so sure. i wonder if it doesn't just seem that way for being black-&-white. that is, after all, the literal translation of the term ""film noir."" (technically speaking, The Honeymooners and The Addams Family both qualify.)
the '60s color edition didn't exactly pull it's punches or sugarcoat it's subject matter, either. after all, it had to reflect a much more volatile time when the average man's trust in and/or respect for the ""fuzz"" had taken a bit of a nosedive. both are unflinchingly earnest depictions of police work minus Hollywood: frequently tedious, always thankless, often frustrating if not depressing. on the whole, in fact, i'd have to say the '60s version had the edge, for two reasons.
most obviously, Harry Morgan is easily the most engaging of Joe Friday's many partners. Morgan and Webb had a unique, equal parts dramatic and comic chemistry of the sort that you hope for, but is just to ethereal consciously manufacture.
secondly, there's it's much wider canvas. where the original was almost exclusively the obvious ""cops & robbers"" routine - robberies, homicides, missing persons, etc. - the later incarnation did what it could to probe every nook an' cranny of the job. we get stories about community relations, for instance, and see up close such internal procedures as the ""shooting board,"" to which every officer must answer upon firing their gun. a suddenly quite versatile Joe Friday gets chances to work the front reception desk, cover the night shift of a hospital, evaluate potential new recruits, even instruct at the police academy. we all figure there's more to the job than ""cops & robbers,"" and the 1967 incarnation made a concerted effort to demonstrate just how much more.
but of course, as long as Jack Webb, the visionary behind this particular vision, is holding the reins, there's no reason anyone who enjoys one version won't enjoy the other.
the same goes for this movie, although the fact that it works is a bit of a miracle. the cinema off-shoot of a television series goes back quite a bit farther than it might seem. factor in old-time radio, in fact, and it goes even farther back than television. so it wasn't exactly out of left field, but Dragnet was never an obvious choice. the semi-documentary nature of the series fits right into a weekly half-hour, but couldn't transmogrify into feature length by the usual formula. there couldn't, for instance, be that most obvious standard for movies in general, the love-interest. there is a sort of semi-love-interest in a police woman Friday tenderly advises to ""be careful,"" but no full-scale hanky-panky. that's neither what Dragnet's about nor what it's fans wanted from it.
in fact, just to demonstrate how singular Dragnet was, the narrative it delivers is the sort of thing almost nothing else could've pulled off. the story concerns increasingly stymied attempts to obtain ""probably cause"" to arrest the man whom everyone knows is the killer. it's pretty much a bureaucratic runaround, which would've been the most boring thing in the world in anyone's hands but Jack Webb's.
and of course you can expect to encounter numerous members of Webb's revolving Dragnet stock-company. the likes of Virginia Gregg, Olan Soule, Herb Vigran, and Harry Bartell pop up here and there. Vic Perrin, often the most odious and obnoxious of Dragnet antagonists, is atypically cast as an ethical district attorney. and of course, the culprit is played by the redoubtable Stacy Harris. (seemingly the most frequent Dragnet ""heavy,"" Harris was such a favorite actor, as well as good friend, that Webb named his daughter after him.) it's pretty hard not to wonder why Don Dubbins and Peggy Webber couldn't make it.
and yes, i have to admit it: Ben Alexander's Frank Smith is an effective sidekick and can (usually) overcome one's regret that he's not Harry Morgan.
in 1987 Dan ""Ghostbusters"" Aykroyd presented his second-greatest cinematic work with his own version of Dragnet. as the namesake nephew of the original Joe Friday, he takes his hero worship to extremes beyond the no-nonsense into the downright stodgy...only to recklessly jeopardize his career after falling in love. basically a conversion of the premise to the ""buddy cop"" format that had become popular in the interim, with Tom Hanks and the contrasting free-spirit partner, that barbed but affectionate film is equal parts parody and homage. by the deceptively simple expedient of shifting the focus from Jack Webb's unflappable Friday to an earnest but flawed protege, it actually makes Dragnet work as the sort of spirited romp tv-inspired movies were/are more apt to be. it's a more than worthy companion piece to the ""real deal"" seen here in Webb's own movie.
Dragnet, like Gilligan's Island or Star Trek, has become such a fixture on our pop-culture that it could be easy to miss how, even that, it changed the game. Webb got the idea while working on a film whose police consultant, on Detective-Sgt. Marty Wynn, bemoaned the inhuman cliches to which the Industry tended to reduce those of his profession. they always seemed to be depicted as infallible supermen, bumbling comic relief, bureaucratic nuisances, or corrupt villains, the ""who"" in a given ""whodunnit."" and that was Webb's masterstroke: Joe Friday was, in entertainment terms at least, the quintessential police human being. (he's Joe as in ""average Joe,"" get it?)
just try to list the great fictional detectives: Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Dick Tracy, Inspector Clouseau. the list just doesn't feel complete without Sgt. Joe Friday, now does it?",1481587200,4,5742,5.070824524312896
