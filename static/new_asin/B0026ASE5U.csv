8352452,2,B0026ASE5U,"After purchasing the Faerie Tale Theatre videos, which my grand-daughter loved, we thought she might like the animated Bedtime Stories as well. She said they were okay, but didn't like the animation and of course could care less about the voices of stars she doesn't know at her age. While the skits in Faerie Tale Theatre were entertaining even to those who didn't recognize the celebrities, the cartoons offered in Bedtime Stories came up fairly short. The charm just wasn't there. She didn't want to watch all of the tape after viewing the first four cartoons.",1247616000,,563,4.875
