6600876,4,B00MU1YG5M,"I'm giving this film only 4 stars, because I'm not sure the PG rating is appropriate, Maybe o.k. for a sophisticated adolescent. The brutality is frequent and shocking, graphically presented in sound, if not visually. The acting is excellent by all the cast, but especially the young actress who plays Matilda from whose point of view the story takes place.
I have read the novel and believe the film is quite faithful to the events and spirit of the book. The mood of this film is overwhelmingly sorrowful.
The brutality reminded me that real people are experiencing horrors like this every day in parts of Africa and now the Middle East. We forget how profound their grief.",1415836800,8,675,4.777777777777778

6600878,5,B00MU1YG5M,"My elder brother (the intellectual) bought me a copy of 'Great Expectations (Penguin paperback-no easy read or Readers Digest Condensed for this twelve year old!) and although I read it (well I read just about anything printed then including me dads nursing books), it was worthy rather than earth shattering. I much preferred the black and white grime of 'Oliver Twist' over the declining gentility of GEs characters. But I had read Lloyd Jones's post-colonial novel 'Mr Pip' and its use of GE as a theme to tell a different story of not being ashamed of where you come from. Although I am a great admirer of Mr Jones, I was a shade disappointed in reading 'Mr Pip'. It may be a lack in my imagination as it is a complex story-Charles Dickens, Robinson Crusoe, post colonialism, paradise, brutality, love and madness rolled into one. But the film I thought was a better platform being visual. It is a sun drenched rich canvas, a sensual and story telling delight, the Pacific paradise where pus like lava flows just beneath the surface, erupting, scalding, lacerating and leaving the landscape permanently changed. The protagonist of this tale is Matilda (the actor Xzannjah), a young Bougainville Islander. The story is lived through her heart, mind and eyes and is a rich tapestry of making sense of the familiar and brutally changeable world within which she lives. In this world the damaged Mr Watts (Hugh Laurie) moves like a shadow from an imperial past. Poignant and doomed by love he opens the abandoned village school and reads Charles Dickens 'Great Expectations'; at first children in a dilapidated schoolhouse and then entering an almost existentialist encounter with the older villagers (in particular the women) who join the class to both participate and challenge. The portrait of the Bougainville village is told with great warmth and humour without losing the threads of petty jealousy and factionalism small communities thrive on. But it is puny against the larger forces sweeping through the area. The impact of global mining, greed and colonialism turning a country inside out and then abandoning it to its fate of tides of unceasing civil war. You witness village life almost unchanged through time is built on shifting sands. What appears normal fractures under contact with first secularism and the strangeness of Mr Watts relationship to the village and his damaged Bougainvillian wife. Her burial scene and the story telling it invokes from the villagers is moving. However, it is the relentless, violent surge of the civil war that cuts across this and accelerates into the nightmare encounter with soldiers and a casual brutality. The story builds and then ends in a confrontation so eviscerating it pushes aside any idea that any of the protagonists has control over events that tear apart their lives. It is in the end an inspiring story celebrating the strength and dignity of the main character. Andre Adamson has created a compassionate, absorbing and impressive film. Highly recommended.",1415404800,6,3021,5.056112224448897
6600879,4,B00MU1YG5M,"This New Zealand production, directed by Andrew Adamson (of Shrek fame) is based on a critically acclaimed book, which I have not read, that apparently takes place on an unnamed island in the Pacific. The filmmakers decided to set the story on the island of Bougainville, which is part of the independent country of Papua New Guinea.

There is a war raging, and a hostile military harass the villagers believing they are sheltering the rebels. As this goes on, a young girl becomes fascinated by the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, which is being read at school by the teacher (Hugh Laurie), the only white man in the village. The causes of the war are never explained in the movie, though a quick internet search tells it involves rebels who want Bougainville to become independent of Papua (happily the war seems to have ended now, with Bougainville becoming an autonomous region). As for the movie, the constant references to Great Expectations didn't do too much for me (and I did read the Dickens' classic, though as a child, so I don't remember it very much). I was more interested in the movie almost ethnographic side, showing the daily lives of the people there with their traditional lifestyle in the midst of a very beautiful place. The movie never convincingly explains why the teacher is there, or why he feels is better to teach them Western literature than practical skills (and frankly, for what it is shown in the movie, he's not much of a teacher). If you come to think of it, the movie is a bit condescending, as it has a Western man teaching the natives how to feel, think, all in the village end up looking up to him, etc.

Laurie is lost in the role, but the native actors are very good, especially Xzannjah Matsi as the girl Matilda. The best performance, however, is by the actor playing the evil officer in charge of the Papuan troops (from reading the final credits, I believe his name is David Kaumara). With some unbelievable plot turns, this film is not perfect, but very intriguing and very much well worth watching.",1414627200,5,2056,4.692520775623269

6600881,1,B00MU1YG5M,"I am afraid I must agree with the one-star reviewers, particularly the very brief review that mentioned loving Hugh Laurie, his performance being the only redemptive feature in this film. I cannot watch any film that so gratuitously depicts horrible violence and brutality, over and over again, as a kind of pornography of violence for the sake of violence. Any underlying theme that might have been salvaged from this narrative is completely overshadowed and obliterated finally by the terrible and absolute monstrous stupidity and cruelty of the military. Besides, the title character, who is played by Mr. Laurie, is murdered in another senseless act, he has already been set up and burnt out by the villagers owing to the idiotic and almost bestial mother who is then later tortured and raped on camera, and we are supposed to last through this self-destructing narrative and come out the other side seeing the redemption of the entire bloody mess because one girl ends up making it to London and going to school?

My wife liked the girl's fantasy scenes in incredible brightly dyed Victorian clothing (by the way, she would have no idea of the cut or design of a surtout, a top hat, a camisole...) I however found them to be a typical gratuitous example of a film school graduate indulging his or her incestuous attachment to a designer an actress and a flashy idea that adds nothing substantial to the plot, at least with any economy. Certainly there are other plainer ways of letting us know that the girl is captivated by the Dickensian narrative. But if you want to get some great ideas for next year's Freaker's Ball, check these scenes out. Just remember to skip past the rapes, the bludgeonings, and the killing of clowns.

Otherwise, your seasonal affective disorder will really start reminding you of the ultimate pointlessness of all human endeavor. Who needs it?",1447804800,7,1878,4.90251572327044

6600891,5,B00MU1YG5M,"Beginning this intensely learned movie is written clarification of the situation of the country our heroine hails from. Matilda (Xzannjah) comes from Bougainville and lives with her mother, Dolores (Healesville Joel) on this remote island in the South Pacific. It is owned by Papua, New Guinea and is in the middle of warfare. The conflict has brought about many unspeakably brutal deaths and so many of the population fled its borders. In the year 1989, this country had the largest open copper mine, a vital export, until its closing because of the unbelievable civil unrest. Being out of gainful employment, the people were impoverished and mainly their men scattered to look for work. Bougainville is now under an ominously brutal regime ruling through dominance and at a whim, intolerance. From the novel by Lloyd Jones, director Andrew Adamson brings to the audience ""Mr. Pip"". This rendering of young and determined Matilda, her Christian mother along with her influential teacher, Mr. Watts (or ""Mr. Pip"" - Hugh Laurie) inspire her to escape while using her own imagination. Her daydreaming and imagining scenes are priceless. Through a pivotal scene of the greatest selfless love and the most tragic of sacrifices, we view a much harsher coming of age tale for a young Matilda. This all becomes intermingled with Charles Dickens' story of ""Great Expectations"" taught by Mr. Watts in a one-room schoolhouse.

Disillusioned by love himself, Mr. Watts (his wife, Grace, has now passed on) lives in Bougainville also. He decides to start teaching in their small school. As Matilda has previously narrated, Mr. Watts (Mr. Pip) would not ever leave Grace for reasons that do unfold in the tale. He begins instructing the classroom with reading the novel by Dickens of a 'benefactor' that has the children more than just interested but merrily joining in the conversation every day. It soon attracts different children's parents, though mainly mothers, who eagerly join in and at times challenge different positions and different viewpoints until the whole village appears consumed by the story of ""Pip"", God, and science. It is apparent that they all worship in several different ways.

I wouldn't want to give much of this away as Matilda's story is so very interestingly dark, gritty and loving to view. Mr. Watts is constantly bringing home the point of view of Dickens: ""It is the most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home ..."". As the tragedies multiply for Mr. Watts and for Matilda there comes a point where decisions must be made and then followed through with. They are primarily for Matilda's welfare. The movie is beautifully photographed (John Toon) and the differences in the cultures are brightly and, at times, agonizingly shown. Also, one will enjoy the lovely music (Harry Gregson-Williams) that indeed sparks this movie even more so. Although I almost could not watch it passed just shy of the midway point (certainly not because of boredom but rather, for its intensity), as it deals with some very graphic truths and situations concerning the rebels. I am glad that I stayed with this film as watching Matilda became more and more fascinating and inspiring had me grow through her fortitude. She is truly a survivor because of every trauma she has been through. It all adds up to be throughout every agony during her life, 'to the victor go the spoils' in the long run. But there still is that vital question that begs an answer while this movie parallels some of ""Great Expectations""; Does Matilda actually have a benefactor or will it be her lifelong dream after breaking away that she does have enough purpose in her life - or both?

Hugh Laurie just gets better and better. His chosen portrayals are very real and he is quite unafraid to show the truth of it all just as Matilda is also in, ""Mr. Pip"" - Bravo to this film in absolutely each and every way. A definite don't miss ...",1428278400,5,3911,4.913767019667171

6600894,5,B00MU1YG5M,"I love films that take risks. I love films with great acting. I love films where the story told is complete.

I was moved, educated, and so very satisfied having watched this film.",1426377600,2,318,4.696428571428571
6600895,4,B00MU1YG5M,"There are several themes interlaced in this poignant film. The simplest is the coming-of-age story of a young girl whose inner life is awakened by the story of Great Expectations. Another is the history of civil war on a small island ruled by Papua New Guinea and the inevitable cruelties that result. Yet another story is the conflict between education and religion. It's this third story that in many ways is the core around which everything revolves. The village preacher resents the success of the white man reading from Dickens' novel. Her world is a simple confection of gods and devils, right and wrong. And as is so frequently the case, her religious fervor combined with personal jealousy leads her to commit acts that are objectively wrong and ultimately disastrous for her entire community.

It's difficult to make films these days that touch on difficult subjects because our Politically Correct sensitivities want to avoid any potential offense caused to any potential viewer. So some may find the sight of an educated white man bringing education and thought to a dark-skinned tribe difficult to bear, as it doubtless carries echoes of colonialism. Equally the uneducated dark-skinned soldiers who victimize the islanders seem primitive in comparison to Western standards. But these things are reflections of the real world and in the context of this tale they are fundamental. So in the end we can either have a true but uncomfortable story or we can have Disneyesque pabulum. If you want action and adventure, clichd story arcs and character arcs, and the inevitable ""resolution"" just before the final credits you should look elsewhere. But if you want a captivating film well acted and directed with great delicacy, this is absolutely a film worth watching.",1426377600,12,1774,5.096219931271477
6600896,4,B00MU1YG5M,"The picturesque South Pacific Island of Bougainville and a civil war would be completely unimaginable when standing on the white sands of its beaches, yet it happened and most of the world probably knew little about it from 1988 to 1998. Mr. Pip blends the novel Great Expectations by Charles Dickens with the harrowing Bougainville Civil War, and the last remaining Englishman on the island Mr Watts (Hugh Laurie) mentors teenage lead protagonist Matilda (Xzannjah) by teaching her the novel. She finds herself shifting thoughts between iconic Dickens character Pip and the carnage going on in Bougainville. The narrative contains considerable personal loss for Matilda, yet she discovers much about herself and those she deeply cares for. Pleasingly mysteries and eccentricities of the storyline come together unexpectedly.

Many of the able-bodied men, including her father, have left the island to find work elsewhere. Matilda lives with her mother, a self-appointed preacher of sorts.

There is an Englishmen, Mr. Watts, living in the vIllage. He takes it upon himself to teach the village children. When he reads the Charles Dickens novel, ""Great Expectations"" to them, it captures their imagination, as well as that of many of  their mothers. Matilda and the other children begin calling their teacher, Mr. Pip. Matilda is entranced with the book and her imagination soars. Her mother, narrow minded and jealous, feels her authority with her daughter, as well as her standing in the community is being undermined by this teacher, and she becomes a smoldering hotbed of resentment. So, she does something that would have great consequences for many on the island.

When civil war unfolds and rebel forces invade the island, their treatment of the villagers takes an ugly turn. The actions of Matilda's mother would have great and lasting impact, raining a living hell upon the islanders with devastating consequences for many, including her own daughter. The scenes in this part of the movie are uncompromising and not for the squeamish..

Hugh Laurie is marvelous as Mr. Watts aka Mr. Pip. The cinematography is gorgeous. The scenes in which Matilda's imagination runs wild and she envisions the world of ""Great Expectations"" in tropical colors defy description. The film is a little slow in places but picks up momentum with the arrival of the rebel forces. Still, I found myself to be somewhat ambivalent overall about this film. This is probably due, in part, to the fact that some of the English spoken by the islanders, particularly by  Matilda, was incomprehensible to me,  and there were no English sub-titles provided.",1462838400,2,1999,5.006024096385542

***The following essay contains spoilers about both the novel Mister Pip and film Mr. Pip. Proceed at your own risk! ***

Utter shock. Then sadness. Then the question, How can human beings treat others so barbarically? repeating over and over in my mind. Those are the feelings and thoughts that the climax of the film Mr. Pip evokes. The 2012 film is based on the 2006 novel Mister Pip by New Zealander author Lloyd Jones. The story is told by Matilda, who recounts the events that happened to her and other villagers on the small island of Bougainville in the South Pacific during the civil war around the year 1990. Reading the novel Mister Pip, one gains an appreciation for dynamic literary elements that are inherent in the form of a novel, such as the repetition of linguistic symbolism to form a motif that enhances the depth of the storys meaning, and the diction suited to a first-person narrator. Comparing the novel to its adaptation in film, one realizes that the film adaptation is both an original telling of a new story and a modified telling of someone elses original story. Examining how each work is both unique yet related to the other, one finds differences between a novel version of a story and a film adaptation of that story, and one arrives at an understanding of why people feel that books are better than movies, and vice versa. An examination of symbolism and narrative point-of-view, which are employed in different ways in the novel and its film adaptation, illustrates how the open-ended quality of a novels linguistic narration involves more of the readers imagination in the creation and experience of a story world, whereas a films pictorial narration involves less of the readers imagination in the creation and experience of a story world. Though different story experiences result from the novel and the film, one still sees how a film adaptation of a novel can complement the artistry of the novel and result in an overall increase in the beauty of the story as it goes on to live in the readers and viewers mind.

Because novels employ primarily linguistic narration and films rely primarily on pictorial narration, the novel Mister Pip employs its symbolism differently from the film adaptation of the novel. The novel, for example, employs the keyword pip, a word which figuratively unlocks meaning in different ways throughout different parts of the story.

To analyze the function of the word pip in the novel, one must first understand several different definitions of the word pip. Definitions of the word pip include the following: a small, hard seed of a fruit; an excellent or very attractive person; a small shape or symbol; any of the spots on playing cards, dice, or dominoes; a single blossom of a clustered head of flowers; a diamond-shaped segment of the surface of a pineapple; an image of an object on a radar screen; a star on the shoulder of an army officer's uniform; a disease of poultry or other birds causing thick mucus in the throat and white scale on the tongue; a young bird cracking the shell of the egg when hatching; to defeat an opponent by a small margin or at the last moment; and to hit or wound (someone) with a gunshot.

That the word pip has so many meanings, some of which seem unrelated to the other meanings, but all of which tend to generally be related to the idea of something small that is distinct, makes it a keyword that offers significant potential as a symbol. The many meanings of the word pip reveal how a novel can achieve layered symbolic meaning through linguistic narration. By employing the word pip as a keyword, that is, a word with symbolic meanings that can be interpreted in various ways, the author involves the reader in the creation and experience of the story differently from how the filmmaker involves the viewer.

In the novel the significance of the word pip as symbolic is revealed through the course of Matildas narration. Characters, events, and ideas in the story connect to the multiple meanings of the word pip. It is fair to say that Lloyd Jones, the author, intends for the reader to access the symbolic meanings suggested through the novels consistently repeated literal and figurative instances of different kinds of pips. Moreover, it is clear that the film also incorporates symbolism related to the idea of a pip, but to a lesser extent.

The idea of a ""pip"" becomes a motif in the story that Matilda tells. The most significant example of the symbol of a pip in the novel is Matildas description of the moment that Mr. Watts begins reading Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations aloud to Matilda and the other kids. In the very beginning of Great Expectations, the pronunciation of the name Pip is revealed to be the innocent mistake of a child. Additionally, ""Pip"" is not the full truth, per se, because the protagonist's full name is not Pip but rather Phillip Pirrip. Here the accidental but fitting name Pip suggests the way that ones identity is both something controlled by an individual, yet beyond ones own control. Although the character Pip chooses how to identify himself to others by choosing what name he uses, he cannot control the fact that he is an orphan, nor can he really control what his original name was, nor can he really control so many other unpredictable aspects of his life. Yet Pip, through the act of storytelling, can control how--of if--he wants to present the truth about his life.

The character of Pip reveals that a person must struggle to come to terms with hard truths about his or her own personal life. Both Mr. Watts and Matilda face this struggle in their own ways. Mr. Wattss full backstory, which is pieced together for the reader as Matilda tells the story, involves a failed marriage and his experiencing of the death of his infant daughter in his new marriage. This is a difficult story for Mr. Watts to relate accurately to others. Mr. Watts struggles to be a role model for the kids he is teaching, yet he is unable to openly present the full truth about himself, even to Matilda, with whom he forms a close bond. It is not until she travels to London that Matilda understands Mr. Wattss backstory to a fuller extent, and it is ironic that she understands larger truths about Mr. Wattss life only after he is dead and is no longer around to tell stories about himself.

Matilda also struggles to come to terms with hard truths about her own life. The interesting thing about Matildas storytelling is that it constitutes the full story of the novel Mister Pip, and as such, all of the other characters are presented through Matildas filter, so to speak. Mr. Watts, her mentor, has made an impact upon her not only through his passion for Great Expectations, which introduces her to the character Pip, and together, Matildas interactions both literally with Mr. Watts and figuratively with Pip transform the person that she becomes. The telling of her story, then, becomes an act of self-actualization. Her story becomes a figurative island of truth in an ocean that contains everything besides her personal truth.

Matildas story culminates with the description of atrocities that were committed against the people of her small village on the island of Bougainville. It is fair to infer that one innocent, ""skinny thirteen-year-old""--Matilda--is the only person to recount the horror of this truth; her sole narration of these events suggests the way that full truth is inaccessible, yet we are able to approach truth, especially through the act of storytelling. Symbolically, I see the idea of a ""pip"" relating to the idea of innocence and to the idea that people don't always know the full story, nor do they know how to tell the full story, and oftentimes there is no way to access the full story.

The pip also relates to several other ideas suggested throughout the story: the idea of that Matildas imagination can provide escape from what confines her; the idea that moral boundaries provide containment that at the same time offers escape; and the idea of being literally trapped on a tiny island in the South Pacific Ocean. These other incorporations of the symbolism of the pip work together to give the novel aesthetic coherence. Seemingly disparate parts become unified when the reader accesses the meaning of the pip symbolism.

Interestingly, the symbol of the pip is featured in the very opening moments of the film: the camera, from a birds-eye view, descends onto a black dot surrounded by white. This black dot is revealed to be an umbrella, and it is being held by Matilda, who is walking along a snow-covered London street. There are several other figurative pips in the opening sequence of the film. Matilda, a dark-skinned woman, appears in a snow-covered, white landscape. Next, she is the only black woman walking down the sidewalk in London, and she wears a light-beige coat and a colorful hat and scarf; everyone else in the same street shot is light-skinned, and almost all of them are wearing dark coats and caps. Then we see a white illustration of Charles Dickens head inside a black circle (a figurative pip) on a sandwich board outside a museum dedicated to him. Shortly after that, Matildas voice-over narration leads us through a flashback to her native island of Bougainville. We see the image of sun being reflected in water, the surface of which are obviously flying over at close distance; the island is revealed as the camera pans up, and significantly, a small green dot--the reflection of the sun caught in the camera lens--remains onscreen for a few seconds as we take in the landscape of one shoreline of Bougainville island. Following that, there is a sequence of high-contrast images of Bougainville villagers framed in long-shots against mostly blank white backgrounds. Each of the camera shots described in the sequence above incorporates figurative representations of the pip symbolism.

This symbolic choicethe envisioning of several kinds of literal and figurative pipsduring the opening sequence of the film makes it apparent that the many instances of pips throughout the story are intentionally developed both by the author and the filmmaker.

Overall, the motif of the pip provides aesthetic unity to many ideas in both the novel and film versions of Mister Pip. The pip evokes and unifies the following ideas that recur throughout the story: the concept of an individuals struggle in society; the concept of a subversive idea (which relates both to Mr. Wattss attempts to educate the children, as well as the conflict between different factions of soldiers warring over the Panguna copper mine); the concept of an original idea, such as the students low, rhythmic chanting of their own names with their own voices; the concept that Matildas imagination offers escape outside the boundaries that confine her; the concept that moral boundaries guide individuals, and in the absence of clear moral boundaries (such as during times of war), individuals can be wiped out en masse; and the idea that a lone eyewitness, such as Matilda, can be the only hope for preserving the historical events experienced by a group of people.

One difference between the novel and the film is that the symbolism of the pip seemed ubiquitous throughout the novel, whereas I didn't detect its employment as thoroughly throughout the film. Perhaps this is one reason why an attentive reader and viewer might judge the book to be a more engrossing experience than the film: by achieving depth through subtle, linguistically-employed symbolism, the experience of the story through the novel can prove to be more intellectually stimulating and enriching. Linguistic narration can present a multiplicity of meanings. The film, on the other hand, which relies on pictorial narration, perhaps leaves less room for imaginative interpretation because the visual representation of the story world is decided not by the readers imagination, but by the filmmakers imagination. The linguistic narration of the novel makes it more difficult to access the story, and leaves the envisioning of characters, setting and plot events to the readers imagination. The open-ended quality of linguistic narration creates more possibilities for a reader to find connections among layers of symbolic meaning.

In addition to the differences between symbolism in the novel and film, the novels narrative point-of-view differs from the films narrative point-of-view. The novel employs Matilda as a first-person narrator, and first-person narration is usually only possible in novels. Films that attempt to portray first-person narrators usually achieve only a kind of third-person limited omniscient narrator because the camera shows us things from a third-person (omniscient) perspective, although one character might provide voice-over narration of the story, thus creating a narrative point-of-view similar to a third-person limited omniscient narrator.

The differences between the narrative points-of-view in the novel and film significantly affect ones experience of the story. For example, through a first-person narrator in the novel, the author is able to forcefully highlight the theme that a person must struggle to come to terms with hard truths about his or her own personal life. The author uses Matildas process of narration to underscore how the act of storytelling actually changes how she understands herself and the events she has experienced. Matilda struggles to figure out how to tell her story. A transformation occurs in Matilda at the moment of the novels climax, when she must describe (and relive through retelling) the moment that Mr. Watts is brutally murdered, chopped up and fed to pigs, Matilda directly addresses the reader saying,

In recalling these events I do not feel anything. Forgive me if I lost the ability to feel anything that day. It was the last thing to be taken from me after my pencil and calendar and shoes, the copy of Great Expectations, my sleeping mat and house, after Mr Watts and my mother. I do not know what you are supposed to do with memories like these. It feels wrong to want to forget. Perhaps this is why we write these things down, so we can move on.

Thus, the act of telling her story is precisely what enables Matilda to share her insight that processing difficult memories through storytelling can lead a person to be able to move on. Here is perhaps the clearest illustration of the empowerment that can be obtained when Matilda takes control of her own story in the same way that Mr. Watts and Pip take control of their own stories.

The filmmaker also emphasizes Matildas transformation when Mr. Watts and her mother are murdered, but the experience of this moment of the story is different through the film, partly because the film employs a third-person point of view. The filmmaker actually changes this critical moment of the story from Lloyd Joness original version. In the novel version of the story, Jones chooses to not describe the shooting of Mr. Watts. Why? Consider the narrator, Matilda. Matildas first-person narration not only limits the storytelling but also limits her ability to describe certain events (such as the shooting of Mr. Watts) because she did not directly experience them. She is relating this entire story as events that she witnessed in the not-so-distant past. Because Matilda was not present for the killing of Mr. Watts, she is unable to describe his murder in detail. Instead, she sets the scene: As we watched the soldiers and the rambo disappear I remember feeling preternaturally calm. This is what deep, deep fear does to you. It turns you into a state of unfeeling. Then, she describes the deaththe murderof Mr. Watts indirectly. Unlike in the film, Mr. Watts is not shot in the chest, point-blank, by an angry, irrational, misguided, drunk (or hungover) redskin officer. Instead, Matilda directly describes the following events:

a few minutes later . . . we heard gunshots. Soon the two redskins reappeared by the schoolhouse. They carried their guns on their shoulders and otherwise looked bored. Between them was the rambo. They must have untied his hands because he was dragging the limp body of Mr Watts towards the pigs.

It is interesting to note that such an important moment is portrayed so differently in the novel version and in the film version of this story.

In the film version, the impact of the scene would be much less jarring if Joness version of the death of Mr. Watts took place. The film instead portrays Mr. Watts being murdered very publicly, in front of the entire village, shot in the chest at point-blank range. The overall effect of the scene is similarly shocking to the abrupt death of Mr. Watts in the novel, but the reason for the change in the film version of the story can likely be traced to the difference in narrative points-of-view in the novel and the film. Because Lloyd Jones can use Matildas transformation as a storyteller at that moment of the novel, he can understate the scene of Mr. Wattss death. If similar understatement were employed in the film, the climax would be much less shocking, and the emotional force of the scene would be less, and this stems from the films narrative point-of-view being different from the novels.

Another difference between the novel and the film that relates to the different narrative points-of-view in each version are the scenes in the film that depict Matilda having conversations with and interacting with the character Pip, who is dressed in English Victorian clothing and who appears to be a native from Bougainville.

These scenes are added to Mr. Pip the film, and they enhance the storytelling through the audio-visual medium of film. Similar kinds of moments are present in the book, such as when Matilda describes the connections she feels with Pip, but these moments in the book are not portrayed the same way that they are in the film. The film visually confronts the viewer with a striking representation of Pip as conceived of by Matilda's imagination: Matilda's imaginary Pip is like Matilda in that he appears to be originally from Bougainville, but he is clearly from a different era, he is a Bougainvillean who is enmeshed in a foreign culture, and he lives in two worlds--the story world described by Charles Dickens and the world as envisioned by Matilda's mind.

The inclusion of these scenes in the film is a way for the filmmaker to achieve development of Matilda as a narrator. In the novel, the author is able to show us Matilda's imagination through her continuous storytelling--the way that she uses words to make the story come to life. In the film, however, Matilda provides only sporadic direct narration. Therefore, these added scenes with Matilda's imaginary Pip, remind the viewer of the film that Matilda is like the limited-omniscient narrator of this story.

The difference between the ending of the story in the novel and the film also highlights a difference stemming from the different narrative points-of-view in each version of the story. Whereas the film ends in a way that leaves a viewer feeling that Matildas story has a happy ending, the novel ends with Matilda closing her story in a hopeful yet open-ended way. In the novel Matilda the narrator finishes describing her experience inside the Charles Dickens museum in London, and then, in the silence of the museum, she reflects on the lesson that Mr. Dickensthrough Mr. Wattstaught her a long time ago and during very difficult circumstances. She remembers something about Mr. Dickens about which other people inside the museum remain completely unaware.  Matildas closing words to the reader describe that In the worshipful silence I smiled at what else they didn't know. Pip was my story, even if I was once a girl, and my face black as the shining night. Pip is my story, and in the next day I would try where Pip had failed. I would try to return home.

Whereas the film shows Matilda having returned home and becoming a teacher, the novel leaves Matildas story less decided. At the end of the novel the reader feels confident that Matilda, as the eloquent teller of her harrowing story, has demonstrated how she has already achieved the goal she articulates in her closing statement. Because the films narrative point-of-view is more of a third-person limited omniscient point-of-view, the film cant illustrate the idea that Matilda has achieved the goal she articulates at the end of the novel. Therefore, the film shows a similar sort of achievement by Matilda, but in a more literal way than the novel.

In conclusion, symbolism and narrative point-of-view are key elements of storytelling that significantly impact how a story is experienced and how deeper meanings are communicated by authors and filmmakers. The symbol of the pip, which the author develops significantly and the filmmaker incorporates to a much lesser degree, adds many of the aesthetic layers to the story which makes it possible for a reader (and viewer) to developing her understanding of the intricacies of this story over time and during subsequent rereadings. The novelists employment of a first-person narrator is deliberate and significant, and the films achievement of a kind of third-person limited omniscient narrator that changes the ways that films story can portray Matildas transformation as a protagonist. Still, the third-person limited omniscient narrative point-of-view in the film allows the filmmaker to add artistic flourishes that enhance the novelists original artistic vision, such as the films periodic representations of Matildas imagining of the story world of Great Expectations, which is comprised of a blend of familiar elements from Matildas village life in Bougainville with the foreign world of Dickens England. This particular artistic choice by the filmmaker transforms Lloyd Joness original story in a creative way that enhances the depth and beauty of the story in only a way that the medium of film can. The literal representation of Matildas imagination is something that the novelist would struggle to do as effortlessly as the filmmaker, and to do without the aid of pictures. Beauty is added to the story by this series of moments in the film.

Together, the novel and film develop the overall experience of beauty in Matildas story, which  is all about the importance of ones unique experience of lifes treasures, as well as ones negotiation of unspeakable atrocities. That Jones chooses a first-person narrator underscores the novels theme that truth is difficult to access because people face tremendous challenges in reporting the truth, such as threats, unreliable memory, and being murdered for speaking the truth. Jones skillfully crafts the novel so that the narration underscores and enhances the theme that people must struggle to find, come to terms with, and tell their personal truths, and that having the courage to engage in this difficult endeavor is what it means to be human.",1457913600,2,23034,4.979724460618664
