8476435,5,B000JFHK2C,My high functioning autistic son has misplaced his beloved copy of this dvd. It is great for emotional development and does a great job of modeling emotions and such. He is devestated by this loss and would greatly appreciate someone listing one to sell. Truly is a great teaching tool!,1336262400,,286,4.74
8476436,5,B000JFHK2C,When I saw this dvd on here I knew I had to buy it because as rare as this dvd is I didn't know if I would ever see it again the best way I can describe this dvd is somewhat disturbing first simon was the only normal looking character I thought Jeanette was downright creepy down to her voice and don't even get me started on the talking toilet that being said it did have it moments I thought the music was very good and the plotline was ok too the only other thing that disturbed me was Eleanor was a baby in the normal series the Chipettes were triplets all the same age so I think if anything they should of at least keep Eleanor the same age and could of had Lalu have another baby there but I guess that would have interfired with Alvin being jealous of her after all of this being said I would recommend if you ever see this out in the open I would pick it up,1334361600,,866,3.954285714285714
