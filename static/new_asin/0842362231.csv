It made it come alive & made it interesting.  That's the key with kids;  you make things interesting while they are young & they'll want to learn ALMOST anything.  I'm surprised how many grown-ups/parents that don't seem to understand this simple concept.  It's like; with them ""One size fits all"" type of learning.  No wonder kids aren't paying attention in school & are dropping out!  That, and the fact we are forced to work our butts off till we die, like god said.  Don't pay any attention to what anybody says on here that give this a low rating.  Like I said;  this was my first intro into the bible.",1511049600,,762,4.258741258741258

They put on the 1984 version of superbook when it was suppose to be the 1982 version of superbook. The episode was great and it shows great, but they put the wrong theme song. I agree that they have the right episode, but the theme music was all wrong. They suppose to but the 1982 version before the 1984 version, because i use to watch superbook a very long time ago, and i know all there musical themes. It looks like it was bootlegg and that could be a rip off! And plus when i see that they have release Superbook on DVD, I have just notice on amazon that it was discounted by manufactured, and i don't understand why. But I don't blame amazon for that, It's just some other people that sells stuff on amazon. And that's the reason why I have to give this one three stars, I should give it two. But however, i will give credit that the tape plays good.
