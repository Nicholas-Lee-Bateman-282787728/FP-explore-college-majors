7771144,3,B01GWDCLPU,"I picked this title up at a San Francisco Video Rental Store not knowing what to expect.  I read the synopsis on the box taking a chance 50/50 if its going to be good or not.  Im glad that I did take it.  Jonathan played by Kevin Isola just wants one thing for christmas, the perfect boyfriend.  Jonathan in his early nearing mid 20's lives at home with his  older sister played perfectly by Aida Tururro (The Sopranos).  Jonathan does come off bitter and acts childish at home and finding the ulltimate BF will remedy his existence in life.  Jonathan works at a popular gay bookstore and talking with fellow co-worker James played by Mark Bateman, Mr. Right(Toby played by David Burtka) or what Jonathan thinks is waltzes right in asking for an application for employment at the bookstore. But here's the dent in Jonathan's perfect BF,he's already taken.  Toby introduces to the gang at the bookstore his BF Keith played by Steven Mailer.  Jonathan wants to end it all at this sudden discovery but he hatches plan B and tries to steal Toby away every which way he can.  Along the way, Jonathan's deceit leads him into a whole new direction on what to do cause someone else has fallen for Jonathan. Should he go with Mr. Right (Toby) or Mr. Perfect who has suddenly fallen into his lap?",1023062400,5,1286,4.552173913043478
7771145,5,B01GWDCLPU,"This sweet and clever little film is a cinematic advent calendar, ticking off the days till Christmas.  Jonathan (perfectly played by Kevin Isola) is a quirky young gay man who still believes Santa Claus can bring him a perfect man, with a southern accent.  His sister (also perfectly, and hilariously, played by Aida Turturro) has always been into bursting his bubble, but has raised him since their parents'  untimely deaths.  When Toby, a young southerner, comes looking for a job in the gay bookstore where Jonathan works, Jonathan thinks Santa has delivered his gift, and blindly pursues him.  But the road to happiness is not necessarily smooth, and therein lies the loveliness, and fun, of this little gem.  Jonathan's family -- including his brother-in-law, Stan (an underwear model, but ""not for any of the good brands""), and Stan's mother (a sharp-tongued drinker) -- is combative but, as Keith (Toby's erstwhile boyfriend, lovingly played by Stephen Mailer) says, ""They kind of grow on you.""  This film proves what a wonderful, heart-warming, and intelligent story can be produced on a very low budget.  It is accompanied by a fun group of Christmas tunes in the background.  Merry Christmas.",1019260800,8,1203,5.096938775510204
7771146,1,B01GWDCLPU,"This is not exactly a happy Christmas movie.  I agree with the reviews I have read here, so let me tell you what the movie us really about.  The lead is horribly bitter and mean to his family, friends, coworker, and total strangers.  He shows no redeeming qualities.  I think we are suppose to feel sorry for him and like him for that reason.  The whole film is his quest to break up a couple that just moved to the city.  The description above says this, ""Jonathan discovers that Santa doesn't always deliver what sexy gay boys want, he delivers what they deserve.""  -'Sexy' is a relative term.  Does he get what he deserves in the end?  You be the judge of that.  The film showcases the worst side of the gay culture: meanness that passes for humor and destroying a relationship for personal gain.  I could not sit through the whole movie myself, but I did notice that others in the audience laughed a lot.  If mean people don't upset you and you don't understand the meaning of poetic justice, then you may find the movie funny and worth renting.",1012176000,9,1049,4.43455497382199
7771147,3,B01GWDCLPU,"Sometimes we have expectations and impose those on people or situations.  But beware the twists that may come.  And in this case, it was delightful, but predictable.  A cute movie.",1006732800,5,180,4.933333333333334
7771148,5,B01GWDCLPU,"This film is a gem!  I saw it two years ago at the Dallas Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and wondered if it would ever be available on DVD.  It took awhile, but here it is.  Kieran Turner (director) works wonders with a tiny budget, and the acting is first-rate.  The film is set at Christmastime, so add this one to your collection for the holidays.",1003622400,15,347,4.212121212121212
7771159,5,B01GWDCLPU,"Yes, I think 24 Nights is a nice little film.  All the negative reviews remind me that so many people always view the glass as half empty.

Has the message of this movie been presented before?  Yes, hundreds of times.  The message being that something what you hunt for is something right in front of you that you don't even recognize.

But this theme was put into the ""____ shopping days until Christmas"" format and it turns into a simple and delightful film.  Of course the main character is moody--he is single, living with his sister who raised him because his parents died/disappeared.  It's a sad existance.

So Jonathon does something so cute and sappy...he writes to Santa Claus and asks for a boyfriend.  He thinks his Christmas wish was granted when a young man with a Southern accent appears at the book store and asks for a job...could there be a more blatant sign?

But Jonathon was wrong.  He found love with another man once he let go of his preconceived notions and opened his heart.",1139270400,2,999,4.5875706214689265
7771160,2,B01GWDCLPU,"It was a nice idea and had potential.  But this film is so uncheerful and filled with unpleasant people, if Ebeneezer Scrooge had watched it on Christmas Eve, the ghosts of Chirstmasn past, present, and future would have joined him in saying ""BAH, HUMBUG!""

Here is the story:  Jonathan, an early 20-something gay man is haunted by the death of his parents when he was 8 and, partly to cope, still believes in Santa Claus.  He lives with his sister, Marie, and essentially waits for his life to begin.  The day after Thanksgiving, he writes Santa asking him for a boyfriend, particularly a cute southerner.  Well, the next day, in walks Toby, a guy who fits that description, applying for a job in the gay bookstore where he works.  Believing Santa has answered his wish, he persues the guy of his dreams, but the object of his infatuation already has a boyfriend, uptight, suspicious Keith.  And the story goes from there.

It had possibilities, but rarely makes good use of them.  Part of the problem is the very low budget, which would embarrass a porn production.  The lighting and sound are bad, and the editing and film quality leave much to be desired.  But even worse is writer/director Kiernan Turner's story and characters.  Jonathan is a sullen, immature, self-pitying pothead.  And the supporting characters are no better.  Everyone in this film is either rude, dumb, selfish, and/or noisy.  Maybe the last part is because the sound is so bad, the actors felt the need to shout their lines.

The actors are no better.  Kevin Isola is convincing as a pothead, but other than that he sulks throughout the movie and never gives us a reason to care about his character. Aida Turturro (of ""The Sopranos"") basically shouts her lines, and treats us to more Italian stereotypes than an Olive Garden commercial.  It's laughable for them to be portraying brother and sister.  With his mushy California mumble and her thick Noo Yawk accent, I couldn't believe they grew up in the same state, let alone the same house.  Embarrassing, unintentional comic relief comes from David Burtka as the object of Jonathan's desire.  His performance consists of a bug-eyed, goofy grin and bogus, honey-chile' accent.  Jim Neighbors fans will be happy to know that Gomer Pyle is alive and living in New York City.  And, oh, the poor Stephen Mailer.  A nice-looking and likeable actor, he's stuck in the thankless role of Burtka's insecure, uptight boyfriend.  With his rigid posture and grin-and-bear it manner, it's obvious that Mailer is bored and embarrassed.  I was hoping he'd appear shirtless, to see whether he was wearing a back brace.  He performance screans, ""I can't wait till the filming is over so I can fire my agent.""  His attitude is understandable, but doesn't make the film any more entertaining.

What's sad about this is not only the good premise, but the fact that a few moments are quite good.  The scene where Jonathan mistakes a woman for his deceased mother and follows her to a store Christmas display is genuinely moving.  Some of the quiet moments, like Marie confiding how much she cares about her brother or Keith reaching out to someone he once considered his rival, make us briefly care about them.  And some of the humor is laugh-out-loud funny.  These give you a sense of what could have been.  But there just aren't enough of them.",1132876800,2,3353,4.792321116928447
7771161,5,B01GWDCLPU,"I disagree with ANYONE that the film is shot quote ""Amateurish""...that's pure rubish!  THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS SOOOO APPEALING!  NO high tech nonsense!  BRIALLANTLY done and well acted by all the characters.  Everyone has something that adds a delightful charming appeal to this fun, feel good movie. (Like a nice hot cup of cocoa).  I loved it... PERIOD!  Makes you really believe that there is a Santa Claus! :)  Check it out and you decide!",1105142400,5,443,4.75
7771162,1,B01GWDCLPU,"Aida Turturro could have been nominated for an Oscar for this film. If you are a big Aida Turturro fan, then I won't stop you from checking this movie out. Otherwise, it was just a weak film with a dumb premise. The central character has few redeaming qualities and isn't particularly likeable, so it's hard to imagine why he becomes the hinge of a love triangle. Just because there aren't many gay holiday films doesn't mean we need this one.",1070582400,3,443,4.55
7771163,4,B01GWDCLPU,"To be honest, the film does have an amateurish feel about it, as other reviewers have stated.  But the story is cute, and the actors, for the most part, are quite good.  I must say that David Burtka, who plays Toby, is the most interesting performer in the cast.  He simply has ""it.""  And it's not just his good looks that are so appealing; it's the energy and the interesting choices he makes with line readings and facial expressions.  And as a true Southerner myself, I greatly appreciated his not going overboard with a fake hick accent.  Nor does he 'flame' in a gay role.  He is simply real.  He makes so much of this ""I am pretty"" Southern boy that you just believe he IS Toby -- once again, there is much to be said for that theatre training.  Good acting is in simple moments of brilliance.  I predict he will be a big star one day, playing many kinds of roles.  In addition, you will laugh your [tail] off at Mary-Louise Wilson's hilarious one-liners, some of the funniest moments in the story.  I think this film could have been much more successful if the writer/producer had turned the reigns over to a more creative camera savvy director.  His choices sometimes did not make the most of the scenes:  he was wide when he should have been tight, and what was up with the family sitting only on three sides of the dining table?  It seems he was shooting those scenes as if they were performed on the stage.  But overall, it's a film that certainly grows on you, grainy film and all.",1063670400,5,1493,4.394160583941606
7771164,3,B01GWDCLPU,"I was not sure what to expect when this was recommended to me. I bought it primarily because of price. The story line was good. I think that it could have been more. The character developement was just not complete. There was however a simple beauty that came out in the end. I loved the ending. This is not something for everyone, but a true movie lover will be able to see that it could be considered a diamond in the rough.",1049328000,,426,4.2073170731707314
7771165,3,B01GWDCLPU,"Writer/director/producer Kieran Turner delivers a sweet romantic comedy with very little budget and no big-name Hollywood actors. Fortunately, he found good actors and tells a good story. The back-story is much darker and more tragic than what unfolds on screen, but Turner mostly leaves those sad elements to the imagination. Instead, we see Jonathan (Kevin Isola), a man in his early twenties, still living with his big sister and asking Santa Claus for presents. But this year, he asks Santa for the perfect boyfriend! The characters aren't always likable, but they certainly move the story along quickly, and bring this hilarious little movie into unexpected directions. Even if it's too late for Christmas, 24 Nights will make a good present for anyone who likes warm or offbeat comedies.

7771167,3,B01GWDCLPU,"Lovely little Christmas film with a gay theme: which I thought was quite different.
It definitely goes in directions you don't think it will and the performances are great. The drunk step mother and the over possesive sister are both amazing and give the film such heart!
Toby from the South aint so special in my eyes, but you really want the main character to end up with him, which rarely happens in films these days. The fact that it got me wanting something to happen, and actually anticipating things ""I bet he does this!.."" earns it more points.
Not a masterpiece, and it's quite well made (not a flippy camera view in sight) so I would recommend this one. Good to watch with some friends, or cuddled on the couch with your beau.
Merry Christmas!",1031011200,3,753,4.544117647058823

8764127,3,B01GWDCLPU,"A weak LGBT  holiday film. It was an early entry to this category. Since then some fine films have come out. Like Scrooge & Marley, Make the Yuletide Gay, Shared Rooms, and Red Lodge. Those films are much more worthy of your time",1529366400,,229,4.325581395348837
8764128,5,B01GWDCLPU,"I just watched this film long after it was made and it's still a suprising jem.  This story has so many levels to it and one of the surprises is a young David Burke, aka the husband of Neil Patrick Harris, long before the two even knew each other or bacame an item.  So Jonathan is a twenty four year old guy who smokes a lot of weed, takes ecstasy from time to time but teh real issue is that he got absolutely no closure when his parents suddenly ended up dead, a death which is never really explained.  So Jonathan's much elder sister Marian takes her spacey brother in and raises him as her ""weird"" little brother while Marian has her own anger issues that she's never really dealt with.  Jonathan chooses to believe in Santa Claus because his happiest times were when he was seated on Santa's lap and his mother was present fawning over him.  Otherwise, the very quiet and shy Jonathan was often ignored, as it happens in the opening scene when Jonathan runs into a street Santa who knows his name? So, Jonathan managed to get a job in a gay bookstore which is noted for its snarky gay employees who are more concerned with gossiping than actually serving customers or minding the store. Then a young man with a Southern accent enters the store (played by David Burke) and Santa has given Jonathan his Christmas gift early!  I won't go much further but as Santa will sum it up at the end of the film.  ""Sometimes what you want fall right onto your lap Kid.  If you wait too long it will be gone forever.""  I want to see a sequel someday and I hope that David sees this. His character in a low budget twenty years later thing would be great, especially if he can get husband Neil to make a cameo as his new ""husband"" with all of the kids.",1507766400,,1742,4.286585365853658

8764132,1,B01GWDCLPU,"David Burtka cannot act! He plays Toby, the object-of-affection of a drugged-out, totally unlikeable, man-stealer lead character named Johnathan (Kevin Isola).  The real catch is Toby's partner--a handsome, psychologist-in-training character named Keith (played extremely well by gorgeous actor Stephen Mailer). One of the biggest flaws of the movie is the script which wants us to root for Johnathan to find love by Christmas Day, when he's an absolute rat! He's good looking, but highly dysfunctional, is far too familiar with substance abuse, ungrateful to the sister that raised him and coniving(in great earnest)to break-up a male couple so that he can have the object of his affection, Toby, all for himself. Why would anyone root for someone like that???  The viewer is asked to buy into an implausible storyline that Toby's partner, Keith, would ultimately figure out what Jonathan was up to and instead of scorning him, he falls in love with him. Ridiculous! Not to mention the fact that a nice, scholarly gentleman like Keith would never go for a druggie who was trying to steal his boyfriend. I didn't buy the plot, or David Burtka's acting, for a minute!

8764135,4,B01GWDCLPU,"As far as I know this is the first film (albeit low-budget) which tackles the 'Christmas romance' genre with the gay twist.  I think it does a quite admirable job with a charming attractive cast, some fine comedic acting at times, and a script which tries (sometimes a little TOO hard) to show a genuine sentimentality of what growing up in a less than perfect situation can be... especially during the holidays.  It may not be a five star film, but it is one that I look forward to watching each Christmas... for yes, even gay 'boys' too, dream of Santa bringing them their one true love for Christmas.",1261267200,,603,4.522935779816514
8764136,4,B01GWDCLPU,"This film was a joy.  Kieran Turner's story broke the bounds of what a feel good movie has traditionally been.  Finally a story I felt spoke to me in the oft made irritants that are the stuff of romantic comedies.  It is accessable especially to us grown ups that were children of the eighties and living in the world of trying to make a life for yourself in the modern age.  Touching while not insulting your intelligence, it made me laugh and tear up a bit at times. Kieran Turner's commentary is equally as humorous and like watching a whole other film.  I suggest listening to the commentary as there's a whole slew of ineresting tidbits behind the scenes.  In summation, it's the best love triangle story I've ever seen.",1242518400,,725,4.538461538461538
