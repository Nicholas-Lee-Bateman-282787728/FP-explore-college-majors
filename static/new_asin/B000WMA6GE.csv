8224133,4,B000WMA6GE,"This double sided DVD contains two of John Ford's silent films,Hangman's House(released May/28) and Three Bad Men(released Aug/26).Both are melodrama/potboilers,the former set between Algiers and Ireland,and while the latter in the old west. Ford deftly directs both and it shows Ford's penchant early on for having strong leading characters.
Hangman's House stars,among others,Victor McLaglen,June Collyer,Larry Kent and Earle Fox. It concerns McLaglen who is an officer in the Foreign Legion. He receives a letter that compels him to take a temporary leave of absence to go back home to Ireland. He arrives but is disguised as a wandering monk. He is a wanted man there. Next we in turn delve in to the private life of a hanging judge whose life is nearing an untimely end. Before he goes he wants his daughter Collyer to marry a man other than the one she currently sees and is in love with(Kent),a guy played by Fox. Fox is a low down skunk of a stool pigeon. Putting her own feelings aside for her father's sake Collyer marries him,but it is a loveless affair. Kent,is not impressed,but does the gentlemanly thing and steps aside.
After her father passes away Collyer decides to run the family thoroughbred in an upcoming race. The horse is well known throughout the county and most all bet what they have on her. However Fox,desperate for money, not only bets all against the horse but has the jockey kidnapped to boot. Kent steps in to ride the nag. Just before the race Fox spots McLaglen and has him arrested by the British Army. Despite all the pre-race drama,Collyers horse wins the race,much to everyone's delight,except for Fox. As everyone is gathered around the horse in a cheerful mood the despondent Fox comes out and shoots the horse dead. The crowd immediately swirls around him and without the army's help he would have been killed also.
Fox goes into seclusion at the daughters home(Hangman's House).Meanwhile McLaglen has been freed from jail by friends and is now hiding out. Collyer and Kent meet with him to find out that the letter he received in Algiers was from his sister who passed away in anguish over the husband that left her. The husband was none other than Fox. Kent meets with Fox and gives him money to leave the country and never come back. That night when Collyer returns home Fox beats her and she is forced out and over to Kent's place to stay with his mother. This is the last straw for Kent. He heads for Collyers home.
Meanwhile ,and free, McLaglen is just about to board a ship to return to Algiers when he gets word that Fox is at Hangman's House. McLaglen  heads for the house and actually beats Kent there. They both confront Fox who manages,after a scuffle, to flee to the upstairs. However he knocks over burning candles on the way,which starts a deadly conflagration. Kent and McLaglen get out just in time, but Fox is trapped and ends up dying when he falls to his death. The film ends as Collyer and Kent are now together and a satisfied McLaglen wishes them well as he heads for port to return home.
Melodramatic yes but in a good way. Ford manages to bring the two stories,McLaglens and Collyer/Kent's nicely together. The tension builds throughout as Fox who is desperate for money,loses all,shoots the horse and loses any respect whatsoever, and now remains in hiding with no where to go, and then the two men who eventually track him down. Watch for a cameo of John Wayne in the horse race. 3 1/2-4 stars.
Three Bad Men stars,among others,George O'Brien,Olive Borden,Lou Tellegen,Tom Santschi,J. Farrell MacDonald,Frank Campeau and Priscilla Bonner. This is again a melodrama set in the old west,around 1874 when the Dakota's were opened up for settlers seeking a new life and above all,gold. Ford weaves a nice tale of desperate men,with desperate lives seeking gold ,some in a good way,others bad.
The film opens as a wagon train travels across the open plain. One covered wagon in particular breaks down with a pretty girl on board(Borden) and her father. O'Brien comes to their rescue and is immediately smitten with the tough brunette. He gets them going again and they part, not to meet until both reach their destination of Custer,N.D.
Also watching this endless procession desert trains are three desperadoes,Santschi,Campeau and MacDonald wanted in the States and Mexico for a variety of offenses. They are a motley trio. Suddenly they spy a prospect to rob,a lone covered wagon pulling horses. Before they can even start another band of thieves beat them to the punch. The trio rides in and shoos the bandits away. The girl sobs in Santschi's(the leader's)arms. We see it is Borden,who  has now lost her father during the shooting from the other bandits. All alone she asks Santschi and the two others to ride with her,and the gruff old buzzards,their hearts melted, agree.
They finally arrive in Custer a day or two ahead of what will be the great land rush; to allow folks to freely prospect and claim land for themselves. The town is run by a crooked sheriff,Tellegen. He has made a cottage industry of taking advantage of unsuspecting women and families,getting his underlings to rob and extort them,then splitting it all. It is here also that the trio of bandits decide that Borden needs a husband to protect her. The other two go search for a hubby,while Santschi hires O'Brien. After a few close calls O'Brien and Borden finally meet up and renew their acquaintance;falling in love much to the trio's delight.
The night before the great land rush foul things are afoot. A preacher has set up a church and the women and their children are all there praying for a good day ahead. The preacher has been vocal about his stance against the sheriff and the lawlessness that exists there. The Sheriff sends his men to the Church to burn it down. They light the Church and up it goes. At one point the preacher comes out begging for the men to stop as there are women and children trapped inside. Just as he is to be shot a woman steps in front of him asking him to come inside. She is instead shot and falls to the ground. The men flee. The smoke and flames hasn't gone unnoticed and O'Brien,the bandit trio and others arrive to help save the frightened congregation. The lady who inadvertently saved the preacher lies dying, and in her delirium screams out for her brother. Santschi hears this and runs to her. It is his sister. He had recently received a letter from her saying she had fled west with her new love. It turns out her""love"" was the sheriff,who had just tricked her and has now nothing to do with her. As he holds his sister the sheriff peaks in and Santschi gives chase, but he cannot get him. He returns to find his sister dead,and with revenge now in his heart.
The next day dawns and all who have reached Custer are now gathered in a vast line awaiting the canon shot from the army to allow them to ride west. The signal comes and it is a race of monumental proportions. Every kind of vehicle imaginable is in it,riding as fast as their rigs will allow. The sheriff has been way passed the starting line in hiding( illegally),waiting for his chance to get the trio,O'Brien and Borden. The latter know the location of a gold mine and the sheriff wants it for himself. When they pass he and his men follow. The trio all know they are being followed so they tell O'Brien and Borden to keep on going,and that they will hold them off. Before the posse can reach them the trio decides to hold them off by a delaying action,one by one. The first gets a few down but is soon overpowered and killed. The next one hides in a shack of gun powder and when they burst in on the wounded man he blows them all up. The last one,Santschi finally has his moment with the crooked sheriff. The film ends as we see a happily married O'Brien and Borden calling out the names of their old three friends. As the camera pans around we see a baby lying on the floor;named in honour of the men who died so they could have a happy life together.
In the end we find the title is a reversal of the truth. In fact the ""bad""men are three of the best men. They obviously had done some ""bad""things to be wanted in the States and Mexico. But it is the girl's innocence and vulnerability at their first encounter which changes them all for the better. Ford works his magic by interweaving the bad men's story with the girl meets boy story ,and the side plot of Santschi's sister and his ultimate revenge thereof. The shot of the start line just before the land rush is about to begin is phenomenal. It seems to stretch for miles. And the fact it was taken from real events makes it that more compelling to watch. Watch for the sheriff who goes against type,by wearing a white hat! 3 1/2-4 star.
Technically speaking the films are in full screen mode and both look excellent considering their age. There are no extras. The accompanying music was excellently done and compliment the films as they should.
All in all two wonderful ""silent"" films by legendary director John Ford. Both are melodramas with nicely woven plots that should keep you interested throughout.",1423872000,,9114,4.635745207173779

8224136,5,B000WMA6GE,This DVD is really worth having just for 3 Bad Men. It's a wonderful silent western that's really a love story. Beautiful Olive Borden loses her father and is rescued by three cowboys who really aren't that bad. She falls in love with handsome George O'Brien (her real life boyfriend too) and a lot of drama ensues. This print is really beautiful too. A must have for all silent movie fans!,1372809600,3,390,4.507042253521127
8224137,4,B000WMA6GE,"After the success of THE IRON HORSE, Fox wanted anothe epic from Ford, so they gave him 3 BAD MEN.  It didn't succeed at the box office, and the director didn't make another Western until 13 years later with STAGOCOACH.  Despite its monetary failure, 3 BAD MEN is a compelling film, and *not* a companion film to Ford's later 3 GODFATHERS.  They are based on differing books, set in differing locations, and in this film, they rescue a young woman instead of an infant.  Ford *did* make 3 GODFATHERS as a silent, calling it MARKED MEN.  This film shows us people are capable of change, and the photography is stunning. 3 BAD MEN is discussed in more detail in my recent book 'Head `Em Off At the Pass! 94 Westers You Should Watch.'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head-Em-Off-At-the-Pass-94-Westerns-You-Should-Watch/dp/1460905016/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head `Em Off At the Pass!: 94 Westerns You Should Watch</a>

HANGMAN'S HOUSE is sadly remembered for a bit part of John Wayne's and people seem to forget McLaglen's wonderful performance.  Pity.",1343001600,4,1095,5.520958083832335
8224138,3,B000WMA6GE,"I decided to checkout ""Hangman's House"" and ""Three Bad Men"" because they were directed by John Ford.  In the case of ""Hangman's House"", I knew that it was also one of John Wayne's first films; early enough that I figured I was going to have to look real hard to try and pick him out.  Not so, it turned out.  He was quite visable in the horse race sequence.  I didn't see him listed on the cast.  If he had been, I suppose it would have been under the name of Marion Michael Morrison.  ""Hangman's House"" is a reasonably good film but not as good as its' title might suggest.  It stars Victor McLaughlin in a rather curous role.  We see him as a part of the Foreign Legion in Africa who gets a cable and has to rush home ""to kill a man"".  The rest of the story revolves around a young woman forced to marry a man who is not the one she would have chosen.  She has to do this to satisfy her dying father who was known as a hanging judge (hence the title).  This story is interesting enough and the dramatic presentation is pretty good for its' time.  However, the various different roles really don't fit together all that well.

The better film of the two on this DVD is ""Three Bad Men"".  It's a bit reminiscent of Ford's later ""Three Godfathers"" although the focus in this film is on the fortunes of a young lady.  The three ""bad men"" are certainly cheats, thieves and varmits but they have the sort of silver lining that Ford does so well in presenting.  These culprits wander into a mining boom town in the Black Hills and endear themselves to a young lady who has already met her eventual romantic interest.  The title trio aren't after romance (except that they make it their business to find this lady a suitable husband).  There's a lot of corruption in this boom town and our likeable bad guys do their best to keep the other villians from corrupting their young lady.  Their unrefined clumsy methods are what makes the film as good as it is.  I was also impressed with the panoramic outdoor locations and the large cast of characters.  The wagon trains and the stampede of the gold-rushers was much more than I expected in a film from that era.

There is an interesting connection between the two movies which is probably why they were yoked together.  Both movies involve a young lady who is led astray by a coniving Lothario.  In both films, her brother seeks revenge.",1229126400,10,2378,4.376712328767123
