8471848,2,B005GM38LU,"Just no...  no - don't rent this and regret the purchase of actual currency.  2 stars only because I give anyone who attempts a movie credit for just having done something I would have no clue how to do.  But, as for content and actual enjoyment, I have to rate it pretty low.",1438732800,,276,4.169811320754717

8471850,4,B005GM38LU,"One of those indie underground horro films that are great fun, ut get old on me quick.  This is like watching a twisted B serial killer flick (who has insecure homo issues), satanic bitchcraft party girls, and a chick tract.  Do you remember those spooky evangelical booklets, that had scary stories to set you on the straight and narrow?  I also like the aspect of the 2 posh demons trying to steer the wayward souls down to damnation. I'll leave it here so I don't spoil it for you.",1405987200,,484,4.415730337078652
8471851,1,B005GM38LU,"OK, forget the bad acting, bad special effects, bad sets -- what this really suffers from is a bad, meandering script.  The person who praised it must have shot it, because anyone else would mention that this looks and plays like home produced crap.  Forget any actors attached to this that you might want to see, they are boring, meaningless cameos.  The ""devils"" are designated as such by wearing cheap plastic strap-on horns.  Really.  Tedious snoozer, period.",1375660800,3,463,4.961038961038961
8471852,1,B005GM38LU,"Which is a lot of what you're going to get in this movie about singularly stupid people doing really stupid things...repeatedly.  They just never seem to learn.  Yes, there is a Satan, of sorts.  Mostly you see two cartoonish minions throughout the movie who can supposedly influence people to make minor choices that lead to significant results down the road.  Our protagonists are a girl who horn dogs just about every guy for blocks around and does just about every drug that uses ""drug"" as a descriptive adjective.  The other one is a handsome guy who gets really violent when he is either in one of two situations:  he's hit on by gays, or women who accuse him of not being normal. Add to this cacophony of nonsense Reggie Bannister and Angus Scrimm, in this solely because of their names and their associations with the Phantasm franchise, and Michael Berryman a near source of amusement as he plays against his traditional type, and you've still got....nonsense.",1345852800,5,969,4.807228915662651
8471853,5,B005GM38LU,"I was lucky enough to catch a screening of this film at the Egyptian in Hollywood last summer and I loved it. The whole film is like a Jack Chick tract brought to life! All of the hot button topics that drive evangelicals crazy are addressed (sexual promiscuity, heavy metal, drug abuse, abortion, witchcraft, Dungeons & Dragons, etc.) as the film's main characters stumble through a ""Hell House"" version of our reality. `Satan Hates You' is complicated, challenging and potentially controversial but also totally entertaining.

It would've been easy for the filmmakers to wink at the audience or to add an extra dollop of easy camp to the proceedings but Director McKenny chose to go for a more ambiguous tone and I think that's why I ended up liking the film so much - It always stays true to its source inspirations (Christian scare films). It always feels authentic.

With a cast that includes such cult favorites as Angus Scrimm, Michael Berryman, Debbie Rochon, Reggie Bannister, Alan Rowe Kelly and Bradford Scobie, the film could have been an exercise in self-congratulatory backpatting for the hipster crowd but `Satan Hates You' achieves something greater. In a lot of ways, the film, while being a condemnation of religious intolerance and ignorance, is also a provocative examination of faith and morality.

In this day and age when seemingly everything has been done and every story told, I love being provoked in some new way. I mean, isn't that what horror films are supposed to do? `Satan Hates You' is a different breed of transgressive. It offends those who want to be coddled at the cinema; it offends those who want to be constantly reassured that they're ""in on the joke"".

The film doesn't provide any easy answers. Smart, funny and genuinely scary - `Satan Hates You' is that rare horror satire that trusts its audience to come to its own conclusions.",1315699200,8,1874,4.883647798742138
8471854,1,B005GM38LU,Caught this movie at a horror film fest in San Francisco. Have no idea why TLA Releasing would pick up this movie as the message is being gay makes you a homicidal manic and/or a sexual deviant with no societal redeeming values and you're going to hell. A turd sprinkled with shiny production values makes it a movie anyone from the religious right would love. Skip it.,1314748800,7,369,4.522388059701493
