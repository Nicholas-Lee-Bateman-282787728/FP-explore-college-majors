8156848,4,B000KGSBY6,"Gig took place on May 13, 1985 at the Camden Palace in London, UK. DVD looks to be a Brazilian import. I've had this for awhile now. Overall, it's a very good quality DVD - both in sound and picture. Tracks that I got the most out of include the opener - one of Nazareth's signature gems ""Telegram"", the inspiring ""Razamanaz"", their well-received ""Beggar's Day"", J.J. Cale's ""Cocaine"", ""This Flight Tonight"", the Scottish band's worldwide smash hit ""Love Hurts"", the heavy-hitting ""Hair Of The Dog"" (if you ask me, perhaps a song -alone- that might've inspired an entire generation of '80's bands - especially Guns 'N Roses) and one cut that {I, for one] did not expect - the late George Lowell (Little Feat)-penned ""Teenage Nervous Breakdown"". A should-have.",1484006400,,759,4.891472868217054
