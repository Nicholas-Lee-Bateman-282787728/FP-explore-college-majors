7166628,3,B00X8ROQYS,"It has become popular to mix fairy tales. In that regard we have a mix of Sleeping Beauty and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Jack, the kitchen boy is the love of Princess Rose. He is held prisoner by the evil witch Dellamorta who looks like Cruella De Vil with Liz Taylor eyes. The dwarfs, who all have different, politically correct names and no beards, must rescue Jack while singing modernized songs to a soft hip-hop type music, making one think every time they sing ""ho"" in a tune.

The dragon is dorky looking and is not a frightening aspect. The film is about friendship, I think. The story aspect seemed geared for ages 5-10. There is an early scene where Rose nonchalantly consults Tarot cards to make a decision, which may be a factor for certain religious folks.

I preferred ""Strange Magic.""  3 1/2 stars",1431734400,7,818,4.551020408163265
7166629,1,B00X8ROQYS,"It had some cute things in it, but it also had some things in it that I have problems with, some brief innuendo, suggestive/revealing (sheer) attire on villain, and a whole scene to convince the dragon not to commit suicide. Even though my kids wouldn't maybe pick up on those things, I wouldn't want them to see this and be exposed to it regardless.",1456444800,,350,4.484375

Not up to big studio standards but still a effective kids romp in 3d.  There's little to dislike here if you enjoy 3d animated films , it's not aimed at adults but it can entertain them.",1449878400,3,351,4.0

7166637,5,B00X8ROQYS,"There are cute and funny dwarfs in this all new adventure. This new story line is adorable and fun for the whole family.

BoBo, the smallest Dwarf, is played Joshua Graham and he is my favorite character. His clumsiness leads the story line through its many adventures. The message is Heros come in all sizes - which is a great message.

Peyton List voices the famous Sleeping Beauty and she has been updated. Although there are many plans in place to protect her, she still cannot escape pricking her finger and falling into a dead sleep.

Norman MacDonald portrays Burner, the dragon. He is fierce and quirky. His voice matches perfectly with his character. Then, of course, there is the dancing. This is one of my favorite scenes and we learn that Burner is great dancer.

The music is catchy and I found myself still singing the songs the next day. They are original songs with great uplifting lyrics. There are many belly laughing moments.

The graphics are classic animation style done in German 3D computer animation. It is bright and colorful. The backgrounds and castle scenes are very detailed. Each character is well thought out with each matching its own unique personalities. Every fairy tale needs a villain and her name is Dellamorta (Nina Hagen). The movie all flows beautifully but this charter is done in a completely different style which makes her seem oddly out of place.

The story line is easy to follow and full of surprises. Many different characters show up from various fairy tales. The story is based loosely on Sleeping Beauty with many twists and turns. The characters are much different from the original versions we all know and love. There are several new ones you will be adding to your favorites list.

The Dwarfs have all new names with different traits and personalities. Their differences help them as they try to rescue Princess Rose and everyone in the castle from the evil sleeping spell. They must go on a quest in search of her true love.

This movie has many messages including 1) Dont be afraid to be who you are, 2) Believe in yourself and 3) Dont judge people before you really get to know them.

I recommend this movie to ages 5 to 8. It is definitely most suitable for a younger audience.
This movie gets 4  toe tapping stars. It is sure to put a smile on your face and many new songs in your heart. It has a limited release in local theaters beginning July 31, 2015 and will be available on DVD August 18.",1439769600,4,2455,4.610091743119266
7166638,5,B00X8ROQYS,"The girls and I enjoyed watching this DVD very much. It had many good messages and had so many humorous sections too.

As you watch the video, if you are familiar with fairy tale characters, you will see Sleeping Beauty, the seven dwarfs, Snow White, Red Riding Hood and the Wolf, Cinderella and more. Of course there is evil and a dragon who ends up becoming a hero along with Bobo the smallest dwarf.

There are silly songs to move along with during the movie. You will see true friendship, accepting differences, problem solving, working together as a team to defeat and evil witch, and of course true love.

There is action, suspense , and many magical characters. There are so many puns too so listen carefully.

The girls totally enjoyed this movie and I did too.

8715410,3,B00X8ROQYS,"Imagine using the GC medium to tell a story built upon classic fairy tales but with the added twist of making pop-culture references all along the way to spruce things up.  Whats that?  Its been done in the Shrek series and all of its spin-offs?  Then again in the Happily Never Afters?  And again in Hensons Unstable Fables?

Okay so The Seventh Dwarf gets no points for originality.  It does, however, stand upon its own merit in a genre one would suspect to be already pretty well tapped.

The Seventh Dwarf (German: ''Der 7bte Zwerg''), is a German 3D computer-animated film, created in 2014. It was released in cinemas on the 25th of September 2014 in Germany and on July 31, 2015 in the United States as a direct-to-DVD affair from Shout! Factory.

The movie is based upon the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty and characters from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and while younger audiences will recognize the source materials influence, it should be noted that this isn't your Bashful, Dopey, and Doc from Disney dwarf fame; no here we have dwarfs by the name of Cloudy, Sunny, Cookie and Bobo to mention a few.

In fact, while it is based upon the famous Brothers Grimm tale, the material for this one serves as a sequel to the films 7 Dwarves  Men Alone in the Wood (2004) and 7 Dwarves: The Forest Is Not Enough (2006).  Not to worry if you haven't seen either prior to going in to this one, its all pretty straight forward stuff.

In the castle Fantabularasa the time celebrate the 18th birthday of Princess Rose, who has been cursed by the evil ice fairy, Dellamorta, has arrived with great fanfare. Of course everyone knows looming overhead throughout the festivities is a spell that states if she gets pricked with a sharp object before midnight, the whole kingdom will sleep for one-hundred years. Thus, and in typical fairy tale logic, the princess is required to wear armor day and night until her 18th.

Everything goes according to plan until clumsy Bobo, the seventh dwarf, makes the type of mistake that allows Dellamorta's spell to be fulfilled. Only by a kiss of true love the curse can be reversed, but Dellamorta knows a thing or two about how these things tend to play out and captures the kitchen boy, Jack, who loves Rose. With the help of a dragon named Burner, the dwarves search for the Prince Charming"" who can save the land.

It may not be the worlds most original take on some classic material but in all fairness, The Seventh Dwarf feels less like a rehash than it does a pretty fun take on the source material.  Directed by former Disney character designer Harald Siepermann (who sadly, passed away during production), and built upon a screenplay by Daniel and Douglas Welbat, the end result here is a film with a few memorable moments that can never quite pull it all together into the type of butter-smooth narrative weve come to expect from studios like Blue Sky and DreamWorks.

The truth of the matter is many of the Brothers Grimm originals contain a good deal of material parents would find highly objectional by todays standards.  One really cant fault The Seventh Dwarf for including unfriendly concepts such as a dragon contemplating suicide after having been laughed at or the sheer skintight gown of Dellamorta that hints toward some anatomical correctness in the chest region.  But parents should be advised such things are present before showing it to their kids.

Pacing is tighter than expected; with a multitude of fairly well done musical numbers scattered about to capitalize on fans of Frozen.  The story is a fairly by-the-numbers affair with a couple of nice touches thrown in for good measure (like the angle of Bobo learning how to tie his shoes as a means of warding off calamity for example).  Another segment that elicits some genuine laughs comes in the form of a pair of Mermen rappers with a hit video on YouTube.

The visuals are a bit of a mixed bag as well- some of the background textures are rich and well lit but the character animations themselves are often overly simplistic and lack any sort of emotional depth.  The English dub (featuring the voices of Peyton List and Norm MacDonald) is solid enough to match the visual appeal of the piece; all in all neither impressive nor offensive.

In conclusion I often joke that going into this one I expected a train wreck but all I got was a simple derailment.  The twisted fairy tale is nothing new in CG (in fact DreamWorks Shrek was one of the earliest major players in the genre), but it is nice to note that a modestly budgeted German film can come to the domestic table with a few fresh tricks up its sleeve.",1488067200,,4626,4.639705882352941
