4897458,3,B005VQRTTI,"The dvd was shipped quickly,and service as always was first class. The dvd of Al's work?.....I have been playing guitar for over 50 years,and I think of Al as one of the worlds greatest guitarists,no question about it. But this is the first time that Ive seen a travel log of Morocco along side of Al DiMeola'performance. I think his playing is just as good,if not better, as ever,but I would have liked to see more of it. Im all for seeing the extras,such as rehearsals,and seeing Al in action,as well a tour of Morocco. Thats fine. But cutting in clips and pictures of Morocco during the show,takes away from this man,and the people he plays with. Having watched and learned from all his excellent concert dvds in the past,a travel log of pictures during the concert,well,it doesnt do justice to the musicians on this dvd. I know I will buy future dvds from this guy,cause I never stop learning when I watch his stuff. So please,Al,stick to the concert,not the background videos. There are not many guitarists that can play on your level! For real!",1327622400,4,1050,4.650537634408602
4897459,4,B005VQRTTI,"First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed this concert! What an exciting music treat! Al Di Meola, whose music has never seriously exposed to my ears before, is such an outstanding guitarist without a doubt and leads me to a whole new world of music. Other musicians playing accordion, bongo, violin, bass and percussion are also exceptional. They altogether create fantastic sound and ensemble.

The technical aspect of this blu-ray is very disappointing, however. While the DTS-HD MA 5.1 & 2.0 audio is excellent, the vision looks like SD at best. I couldn't believe my eyes at first and thought I was watching a DVD not blu-ray. It's definitely the worst-looking blu-ray I've seen. It might be due to either its transfer error or original recording source issue. I strongly believe the concert was originally recorded in 1.33:1 with SD cameras even though it was shot in 2009. In addition, from time to time, video clips (post production) are inserted during each performance, which enhances the mood at times but mostly rather distracting. Camera work is not accurate and precise. Extras are great with additional performances, rehearsals, etc.

All in all, I love this ""unforgettable"" concert and can forgive all the technical issues. I just want more of Al Di Meola! I do hope more concerts from him and his band come out on blu-ray... with a true hi-def quality.",1327363200,12,1362,4.943231441048035
4897460,5,B005VQRTTI,"Obviously I haven't seen this DVD yet but I saw this band with AL DiMeola in 2009 in Bend Oregon. DiMeola's legendary guitar playing goes without saying but if you want to hear the most amazing accordian playing by Fausto Beccalossie ever you will want to get this dvd. Actually you can replace the word accordian and substitute ""amazing acoustic instrument"". I've been looking for just a recording of this group ever since I saw them. This will be a real treat. The rest of the band plays at the same incredible level of mastery as Al and Fausto. Fausto also did some cool vocals. I'm pre-ordereing and will update after I have seen it.",1327190400,3,637,4.547826086956522

4897462,1,B005VQRTTI,"I wish I would have read the reviews first, I never would have bought this poorly edited assuat on my senses. There was not 10 seconds of one thing in the whole DVD I wanted to see one of my favorite musicians actually play! Also I do not like accordion music in any shape or form and the accordionist in this performance tries to steal the show. But the worst part was the constant poorly chosen scenes of BF Morocco. And during some of his fastest runs they started showing images flashing at an incredible rate, I had to turn my head for fear of getting a headache. The sound quality was good but the video was like an old VHS tape. Shame on you for putting out such garbage for an excellent guitarist, but Al has to share the blame unfortunately as well....",1458000000,,761,4.291666666666667

4897466,4,B005VQRTTI,"I would give 4-5 stars just because it is Al, but I hate all of the thrown in video footage that was added to the concert.  I would've preferred to have behind the scene footage that showcased some of the the country's scenery rather than adding it to the concert footage.  I've never liked when concert videos try to get ""artsy"" rather than giving what most fans want - the best video and audio quality that can be produced.  Fortunately, I was able to watch this for free with Prime, but I would purchase some of his other performances before thinking about getting a hard copy of this.  Overall, the songs are great and I wouldn't skip watching this just because of the minor complaints.  As I stated before, it is Al, and because of that, it is worth watching this master of his craft at work.",1431129600,,797,4.394557823129252

4897477,5,B005VQRTTI,"The extra video sets this apart from a typical concert video. I liked that because it breaks things up. It reinforces the cultural aspect of his playing which is, as always, brilliant.
I recommend it highly.",1388188800,,207,4.777777777777778
4897478,3,B005VQRTTI,"Music 5 stars.  Incredibly annoying video distractions 1 star.  The director needs to sit through hours of his/her visual impressions with eyelids held open a la Kubrick's Clockwork Orange.  Perhaps it will cure him/her of inflicting this video masturbation on others again.  When I'm watching outstanding musicians creating complex and satisfying aural canvases, I'd like to be able to enjoy what they are doing with their instruments without an assault on my retinas.",1385769600,2,469,5.383561643835616
4897479,5,B005VQRTTI,"Nice combination of instruments and Al's classical guitar proficiency. I am more familiar with his older music featuring the electric guitar, but his acoustic music is just as good.",1383782400,,181,5.275862068965517
4897480,5,B005VQRTTI,"If Al Di Meola seemed to be, in the least, a pleasant human being, I'd like his music a lot more.  It's difficult to support someone who seems to be such a raging arrogant prick. (fallacy: ad hominem attack.  Yes, I realize).  Nonetheless, everything he does deserves a 5, as he is, undoubtedly, the most technically gifted guitarist the world has ever known.",1375747200,,359,4.666666666666667
4897481,5,B005VQRTTI,Al Dimeola brings a speed pick style that is rarely seen with acoustic electric guitar. His flawless performances keep you entertained and amazed through the entire dvd!,1371081600,,169,5.296296296296297
4897482,5,B005VQRTTI,"Al once again creates a great performance DVD. The ""Extras"" are great to watch and gives you a behind the scenes view of what it's like to be playing in a high caliber band.

The performances (there are 2 concerts) are great to watch and listen to!

I highly recommend this DVD!",1370390400,,278,4.326923076923077

 um show sesancional.

Vale a pena adquirir o Blu-Ray.",1357171200,,113,4.6
4897485,5,B005VQRTTI,"A mixture of color, culture and rhythm. I like the double concerto arrangement from Piazzolla. He's an amazing artist with a facility to performance, make some improvisation. He never lose the beat.",1344902400,,198,5.21875
4897486,5,B005VQRTTI,"I must admit I am partial to Al Di Meola's works since 1976, and he has changed his musical approach dramatically.  If you are looking for another ""Casino,"" or ""Electric Rendezvous,"" you will be disappointed.  This is Al acoustically with MIDI guitar, lots of percussionists, accordion, piano, bass, and various Morrocan instruments.  There is a lot of visuals here that are unrelated to the concert, but they are beautiful and I didn't think that they distracted from having to watch Al's fingers all the time.  He does go electric on the encore ""Egyptian Danza,"" which is quite a treat.  If you liked his World Sinfonia recordings, you'll love this.",1332720000,,651,4.935779816513762
4897487,5,B005VQRTTI,"As usual, Al DiMeola delivers a great performance!  Video quality could be better (1080I/720P).  Somewhat fuzzy looking at times.  Audio, on the other hand (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0) are both great.  Definitely a ""must have""!",1331856000,,252,5.225
4897488,4,B005VQRTTI,"Very good audio of a one hour ten minute set of amazingly good music. Many special features including some songs that I feel should have been included in the HD audio section instead of 2 channel PCM bonus features. The video quality was consistent of filming in dark difficult lighting and the HD rendering shows it but the HD audio on a decent system expands the sound to close to being there. I saw this band in Portland OR and the next night in Bend, OR in 2009 and again on their 2011 tour in Portland and Grants Pass. There is none better!

This is a great sampling of Al and his band World Sinfonia as they toured the world back in 2009. It captures the nuances of the intricate works and flawless musical executions and expressions of 6 master musicians. It also has some interesting visual variations that could have been the ""angle 2"" view perhaps. But overall it is a true musical experience that should be experienced by all that appreciate real music.

Don ""pop, rap, hip hop aficionados probably should look elsewhere though"" Bolton",1329955200,,1046,4.588235294117647
4897489,5,B005VQRTTI,"As stated by many, no the best video quality, but not as bad as many claim either, now one thing is sure, if you are a DiMeola fan, this is for you, unique and superb performance, this guy never stops to amaze me!!! If you want a top notch quality video, then get the BD from Return To Forever, another killer performance from Al...But this one is very good. Despite the video quality, I give it 5 stars...",1328227200,,406,4.217948717948718
4897490,3,B005VQRTTI,"I respect this guy as a musician beyond most guitarists alive today. I've seen him live several times and he always puts forth an incredible performance. And the music / musicianship here is outstanding. Sound quality is good bordering on real good. DTS- Master 5.1 and stereo. Though if you're not into the last decades worth or so of the DiMeola sound...think accordion...you will not like this. Stay away if you're looking for the jazz or rock side of Al. That being said if you like his style of the last several albums you will like this.

But I have to echo what others here have said. The video side of things here is poor quality. VHS tapes look as good. Don't know what they were thinking when they put this to blu ray. Also it's VERY basic editing and menus. And the endless artsy fartsy Moroccan mosaic theme that he seems to be trying to get across inturupts the concert with regularity gets old real quick.

Honestly if I didn't respect him as one of the greatest guitarists of all time I'd give this whole thing one star.

If you're a hard core fan it's worth having. But even as much as I like and respect him. I doubt I'll ever watch this again any time soon.",1328227200,12,1175,4.3807339449541285

8487564,4,B005VQRTTI,"I thoroughly enjoyed the musicianship especially Al DiMeola.  The moods and textures of this concert was very pleasing and quite a journey supported by middle eastern/north african scales, tones and rhythms.  A must for jazz and fusion lovers!",1485734400,,243,5.368421052631579
8487565,4,B005VQRTTI,"No doubt the man is a great guitarist. I am not big on artsy video effects, more of a purist. I want a full stage shot and close ups with Dolby Digital sound. This was all that, but with some shots of the man (Al) about town, locals and architecture of Morocco. I am also a drummer, who while he appreciates the less-is-more mindset with drums and percussion, really appreciates the fusion aspect with all that comes with it. It's a good video, but I think Al went for a more acoustic setting with a top notch band of guys who do just that. It highlights his playing and intricacies with a quieter style of music. These guys are good, just don't expect Fusion like Casino or Tiramisu.",1485129600,,684,4.3515625
