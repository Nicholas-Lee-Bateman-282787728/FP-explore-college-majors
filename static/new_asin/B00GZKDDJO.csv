8628871,4,B00GZKDDJO,I ordered this because I wanted to try the real Tabata workout as it should be done.  It has an unusually long warm-up compared to the actual workout.  The instructor is engaging and very knowledgeable.  The workout itself is very hard but doable.  There are low impact options.,1522886400,,278,4.729166666666667
8628872,5,B00GZKDDJO,"Though the first reviewer is correct and it will work only on DVD players that play all regions or at least EU region, this is an excellent exercise (very tough) which leaves you with an upbeat feeling. I'm a big Cathe fan but don't think she got the concept of  professor's Tabata protocol on her (extremely hard) Tabatacise DVD.  This one, though, really did it! Just wish there was a sequel to this one...",1498089600,2,408,4.5
