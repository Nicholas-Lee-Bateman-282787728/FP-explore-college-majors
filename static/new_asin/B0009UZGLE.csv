8067053,2,B0009UZGLE,"I added this to my NetFlix queue for one reason, Laura Fraser. I've been a fan since ""Harold Smith,"" and now that she's made a bit of a splash in ""Breaking Bad"" I am able to find a few more oldies. But this one should have remained in the vault. Snoozeroo. Starting with that portentous ""A Film By James Bruce,"" with super-snazzy-dazzy high-school graphics, music by Ron Hay, a six letter name that spells high-dollar, a one-named editor, and about 20 producers, executive producers, and co- (or were they associate?) producers, I was mighty wary by the time the credits ended.

Then a preposterous chase, that shows us nothing and makes no sense.....except, I suppose, to show us a ""I gotta break the rules"" FBI guy who looks like Jack Bauer and is even braver.

So ya know the good guys will win and the bad guys lose, and it goes pretty much as expected, though the specifics are what make this a two rather than one star review. But not much there......",1380326400,,957,4.526011560693641
8067054,2,B0009UZGLE,"This movie reminds me of two other movies and those are Stone Cold and Apocalypse Now!
Great Picture Quality,Sound a lot to be desired,could have been better.
Runs-103m
No Xtras
Silent-Menu
I rate it Fair
All the loss of life for a stinking terrorist detonator.
Camera work on this jumps fast from scene to scene.
Main character Mike Varga interesting to watch.
As for Darius,a very spoiled and rich tyrant.
Lazlo,a bad cop,and Ferko,one bad mean cruel dude.
Death by pool cue,com on now?
I myself would not recommend this movie.",1371340800,,529,4.824175824175824

8067056,1,B0009UZGLE,"This was one heck of a stinker. The director must have thought it ""artsy"" with the slow-motion, stop-start, and flash-changing scenes. These ""touches"" were extremely annoying throughout a film that was annoying enough with the terrible acting and accents. Bob Hoskins as Darius; the Russian Mob boss was particularly bad with his ""Russian accent.""

Stephen Dorff playing the FBI agent Mike Varga on loan in Hungary, to stop the Russian Mafia did some narrating during the film; which didn't add anything to it. I've seen him in a few stinkers before; I added this one to my list. And his FBI superior, Rob Shephard (Ian Hunt) was also not very convincing, even as an American he came across very phony. That, and ""Katya"" (Laura Fraser), Darius's daughter, was nice to look at but a pain to listen to. She rounded out an absolutely boring and inept cast in a ""bottom-of-barrel"" directing effort by James Bruce.

There's no use giving a story line, since this is really supposed to be a review. This film stunk.",1235606400,,1009,4.793103448275862
8067057,5,B0009UZGLE,"Stephen Dorff plays an undercover FBI agent who gets sucked into the Russian Mafia by gaining the trust of the big daddy mob boss (played by Hoskins).  I have to tell you I had a hard time getting the image of Hoskins chasing Roger Rabbit out of my mind for most of the movie.  I just couldn't separate him from that character and the Russian mob guy (horrible accent included).  Yes, there were a few unbelievable scenes (even cheesy at times).
  But I love Stephen Dorff as an actor so I was able to overlook some of the shortcomings of this film.  My advice is, if you're not a big Stephen Dorff fan, then you probably won't like this movie very much, because it offers little else at times.  If you ARE a Stephen Dorff fan, then you will probably really enjoy this movie, because as a previous viewer said (it shows a lot of sides to Dorff) and his character is much more multidimensional compared to some of his other films.
I bought it and am keeping it.",1170633600,5,960,4.329608938547486
8067058,4,B0009UZGLE,"i thought this was a really good movie. VERY well acted...especially by Dorff. This is Dorff's kind of role. He shows the good,the bad,and the kind-hearted,caring,sexy self that is ALL DORFF !! I LOVE this guy !!!!",1144108800,6,214,4.8108108108108105
8067059,1,B0009UZGLE,"Stephen Dorff (Blade, FeardotCom) in another horrible movie stars as Mike Varga, an American FBI agent who goes under covers...not under the covers...undercover with the Russian mafia's ""Marlon Brando"", Darius played by Bob Hoskins (Unleashed, Roger Rabbit) in the stupidest way imaginable. Dorff gains Hoskins' trust. David O'Hara (The District, Made) whos Irish is playing Freko here or whatever his name was who is Russian and who is Darius' right hand man and who doesnt trust or think Dorff is who he really is. The lovely Laura Fraser (A Knight's Tale, Vanilla Sky) is alright here (she's done better) plays Katya, Darius' Daughter who Dorff falls in love with during the process. Ian Hart (Enemy of the State, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone)  who is wasted plays Rob who is Dorff's friend within the FBI. The action sequences are weak, the acting is even weaker and the suspense and surprises aren't that great although I did think Dorff actually killed Hart. Speaking of Dorff and Hart I think this is the first time in a long time they've worked with one another. Both of them starred way back in Backbeat where Ian Hart played John Lennon and Stephen Dorff played Stu Sutcliffe. Although the Russian women in this movie are hot hot hot! This movie isnt. Though if you wanna see Bob Hoskins kill some guy with a poolstick this is the ticket for you otherwise steer away. Also starring Zita Gorog (8MM 2, Underworld movies)",1143331200,4,1437,4.817813765182186
