8073986,4,6303336779,"I thought the earlier Swedish movie called My Life as a Dog was better than this. I could see at the end that the boy was sent to reform school, but what then. I think the scriptwriter and director could of added at least another twenty minutes to the movie with a better scenario. Have Roland get out of reform school and release him to a trusted uncle. Now that would of been a better ending. I did like how Roland got revenge on his headmaster and school teacher by getting a friend to give some of his lice to the toilet bowl. Still I would have to upgrade my rating to four stars because the boy that played as Roland endeared himself to me.",1400716800,,646,4.176
8073987,5,6303336779,"An excellent movie. Although there were some scenes I didn't particularly like (the ending for example), the movie was based on actual events in this man's childhood, and for some reasons movies based on actual facts tends to appear more real to me, which I like in movies.",1382227200,,273,4.708333333333333
8073988,3,6303336779,"I wanted so much more from this film. I wanted to care for the primary character as much as in My Life As A Dog  and Fanny And Alexander. With the title and general synopsis I believed  it was more was about his inventiveness and creativity. Maybe so much so that I  waited for what didn't  come and I was waiting for the shine.
Those around him were asses as a whole but I wanted him to rise up more, be so much more.
Think this is one where you really have to watch again to see nuances you may have missed the first time.
As I previously stated I was using the title to guide me but that's not what this movies about. It's family at its core and not a nice one, leastwise not one I liked. Well worth a view.",1352851200,,710,3.944055944055944

I give this film two thumbs and eight fingers up. The film is set in Stockholm during the 1930s. The following is an edited plot synopsis from the sleeve of the VHS box.
*Roland is twelve-years-old. His mother is a Russian Jew, his father is a Swedish Socialist, and his brother is a boxer. He lives in a society that considers his father's politics to be treason, his mother's religion to be blasphemy, and his brother uses him as a punching bag. Roland's rebellious ways gets him the special attention of his schoolteacher who always makes sure that he is punished. Roland is the victim of ceaseless bullying and prejudice but he's a survivor.
*When he's not busy being persecuted, the determined Roland is a budding inventor. Creating a powerful slingshot out of wire and two of his mother's contraband condoms, the young survival artist ultimately seizes on an ingenious way to turn the tables on his oppressors, which brings him fame, fortune, and trouble with the police. The film ends on a poignant note. Fantastic movie!!",1210464000,4,1194,4.945273631840796
