8005255,3,B00011ZBU2,"This missed getting five stars because they thought it necessary to include vulgarity.  I bought this to use for my French class and had to fast forward some scenes of brief beach nudity and others of unnecessary vulgarity.  Without this, it was perfect and mesmerized my students.  They all want to visit France because of the beauty and culture that was well presented.",1443744000,,371,4.857142857142857
8005256,5,B00011ZBU2,Great authentic information. Justine DeShawn does a word full job of narrating throughout the entire dvd. From Day  to Son Ce Michael to mystical spiritual rock ententities. Very informative fub interesting,1420848000,,206,5.645161290322581
8005257,1,B00011ZBU2,"I found it rather superficial and glib, not much depth in learning more about France.
Maybe geared to the young backpacker.
Limited appeal to the older traveler interested in some history to go along with the travel.",1389571200,,216,4.864864864864865
8005258,5,B00011ZBU2,"If you are sick and tired of showing the Parisian path to your introductory students, use this to show them a fuller, broader view of France with beautiful views of Northern and Southern regions.",1377734400,2,195,4.764705882352941
8005259,1,B00011ZBU2,"Shapiro does a really a great job in Globe trecker Mexico city. I cannot appreciate all of the sexual inuendos. I think people sheould come to their own conclusions, especially when it comes to art. I also do not rate highly her friends as she travels. I think she could find people with more class. Most of us who travel like to enjoy good travel information with some class. I do however like Globe trekker Belgium and Luxembourg. Those were well presented and classy.",1319673600,,470,4.607142857142857
8005260,5,B00011ZBU2,This movie is great for the classroom.  very interesting for students and informative tour guides.  Things kids would like to know and not just a boring tour of the country. It covers all over France except for Paris.  Is a bit heavy on the wine and champagne tasting but cheese and escargot information makes up for it.,1128729600,22,320,4.578947368421052
