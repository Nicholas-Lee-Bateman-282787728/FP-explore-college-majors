8321229,5,B001MFNB6C,These are very good movies and you should have them in your movie collection!,1432598400,,77,4.571428571428571
8321230,1,B001MFNB6C,Both movies are in Spanish not English. There is no option for English subtitiles. I would not mind it so much if they at least had english subtitles so you could understand what is going on. When I bought this DVD Amazon stated they were in English. So unless you speak spanish or understand spanish or do not mind trying to figure out what everyone in the movie is saying so you can figure out the plot... I do not recommend buying this DVD. It's like watching a movie with the sound off. I'm not a spanish movie snob....I bought El Vampiro which is a spanish Dracula movie which is great (and dubbed in english) and is one of my favorite movies.,1426032000,6,648,4.319672131147541
8321231,5,B001MFNB6C,"Very good pair of Mexican-made Spanish-language (no sub-titles options) El Santo movies.  The first is a color, mid-1970's film about a coven of werewolves who are out to destroy the human race and El Santo has to stop them.  If they destroy the human race who will they prey on?  The second (and better) is a black-and-white, mid-1960's sequel to Santo vs the Strangler.  The Strangler comes back with the same mad-on to off El Santo and the performers of a theater.  What struck me the most is the kid sister of the theater owner.  The owner wants to close the theater so as to protect the performers until the cops or Santo catch The Strangler.  Kid sister doesn't care about any of that.  Nothing must stop HER MAGNIFICENCE from performing.  The Strangler and his muscled minion keep a wax museum in their lair and plan to add El Santo to the attractions.  The musical numbers are OK but mediocre.  Still the second film is entertaining and the best of the two.  The quality of the Lions Gate DVD release is excellent.  Highly recommended.",1398384000,3,1043,4.603260869565218

I just looove remembering the old times.",1332720000,3,308,4.237288135593221
8321234,4,B001MFNB6C,A classic movie. Spanish language spoken by actors. Plots and acting by the actors are kind of cheesy compared to to-days genre. But it is entertaining in a middle 1950's way.,1282089600,4,175,4.67741935483871
