8351362,5,B0025X4PII,"I bought this movie for my husband for Christmas.  We are classic movie buffs and enjoy even the B-rate makes. I appreciate the companies that produce these in this day and age.  No, it does not look like it has been remastered, but still OK.  A  really cute plot and the kind of movie that you can watch with children and not have to worry about it.  Navy buddies. One expecting a baby.  His wife dies and he gets hurt and dies.  Best friend tries to keep baby away from snooty family.  But in the end everyone loves each other and all ends well.  We love old movies so, this fit the bill.  We enjoyed it.",1421366400,,606,4.146551724137931
