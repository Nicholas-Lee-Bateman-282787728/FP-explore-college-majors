4981756,5,B006A9XTUS,"""Sometimes God has to bring you down to bless you up"" came to mind as I watched this movie.  Regina Reynolds an ""independent"" woman, doing things on her own and for her self.  Taking her family for granted, Regina allows her pride to cloud her judgement.  Mama Knealy shows us how a mother's love ought to be.  Even though her daughter was being disrespectful and bullheaded Mama prayed for her and tried to give her little nuggets of wisdom. Will Regina continue to let pride stand in the way or will she have a humbling experience.  You should watch the movie and ind out.  I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.  Families should watch it together.  s/n: I know its called a mother's love, but the love of a father could also be seen as well.",1358553600,,744,4.5
4981757,1,B006A9XTUS,"No story line, absurd characters, and horrible, horrible acting.  A complete and total waste of time. This is one of those times I wish I could give zero stars.  Uffda.",1352937600,,168,4.566666666666666
4981758,5,B006A9XTUS,"Very interesting.  Captured what a mother's love is . . longsuffering, giving, forgiving and patient.  A very good family oriented movie for the entire family.  Also, good for a ladies time together movie night.",1352073600,,211,5.147058823529412
4981759,5,B006A9XTUS,"Regina Reynolds (Rolonda Watts) had expensive taste since she was a child, and as an adult her love of material things has caused trouble in her family. Can `a mother's love' help Regina to see what's really important in life?

This is the first I've heard of Tim Alexander and Carolyn Alexander. A Mother's Love is a gospel stage play presented in the form of a film (I read that somewhere) and I really enjoyed it. The characters are believable, the story is interesting and funny at times, and the acting is good. There are quite a few important messages, but the one that stayed with me after watching the movie is how much damage can be caused when parents put their lives and careers before their children.

My favorite character was Georgia (Amentha Dymally), a godly woman full of wisdom and love for her family. And my favorite scene was the one with stand-up comedian, actor and writer, Buddy Lewis (Love on Layaway, The Fabric of a Man). The situation that involved him wasn't something I'd laugh at in reality, but he made it so funny in this movie.

I highly recommend this inspiring film!!",1343865600,3,1103,4.61734693877551
4981760,4,B006A9XTUS,I sat and looked at this movie and I really enjoyed it. This movie was too big to be a stage play and it's better in movie form.,1342656000,,128,3.607142857142857
8495738,4,B006A9XTUS,"I really liked this movie. It gave me a life lesson of what forgiveness, love and humbleness is without seeming like it was preaching. I liked this movie because it was a message in it while it entertained you. I would definitely watch the movie again. I think the character's did a great job acting out their parts and the movie was filled with hope, love and a second chance. This movie made you think, which a lot of movies don't do today. Although I did not give this movie five stars it is a really good movie. And don't think just because I did not give it five stars that you will not enjoy it. I actually passed over this movie more than once thinking it was going to be some awful play but it was actually a good movie and I am so glad I watched it because it really lifted my spirits and made me take a second look at my life and remember to be thankful and count everything as joy. God can change any situation and give you a second chance. All you have to do is open your heart and humble yourself.",1487548800,,1010,4.106060606060606

8495741,1,B006A9XTUS,"This is a black film, and I am all for supporting black business, but this movie sucked. Really, I tried to give the brother a break, but there is no excusing this film. Poor story line, poor acting, poor visuals. Just poor quality all around. There is no saving this train wreck.
