7811142,4,6301324404,"One of the most beautiful and under-appreciated actresses of our time shines in this action-romance comedy.  Joanna Pacula is a proven handler of action dramas and is passable in romantic comedies like NOT QUITE PARADISE; this film enables her to do both, and as always she looks gorgeous doing it.

This picture has only one/tenth the budget of ROMANCING THE STONE and the writing is not the greatest, but in the right frame of mind its an enjoyable little romp that mostly satirizes all those true-life TV stories.

Unfortunately its only available on tape, and you know how those things don't look well on modern displays; moreover they don't last forever and VCR machines are harder to come by these days. Its not been released or restored on DVD (and whats even sadder is that its unlikely that anyone is really rushing forward to get it so).  I hope it gets re-released soon.  There are some of us who feel that someone like Joanna Pacula deserves better.",1435104000,,961,4.730538922155689
7811143,5,6301324404,"This is a classic comedy - of the slapstick-y kind. There are embarrassing scenes, weird scenes, crude scenes, probably drug-induced hallucinatory scenes... there also are some fine moments, though, which make the movie worth watching a number of times (""I want the IBM...""). I keep wondering why ""chainsaw massacre"" trash et.al. is available on DVD - and this movie is collecting dust on the VHS shelves?

I check the interwebs for new DVDs periodically, but, so far, no luck.

I do hope there will be a DVD eventually - my old VHS tape is getting a bit frayed from continuous use...",1334880000,,584,4.772277227722772
7811144,5,6301324404,"If you like titles like ""The God's must be crazy"" you might like this. Wacky love affair set in South Africa and produced there as well. Pleasant relief from Hollywood fare.

This should be a ""cult classic"" in your library and is hard to come by.",1290124800,,246,4.3478260869565215
