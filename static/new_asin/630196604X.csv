387307,5,630196604X,"I personally didn't find 2001 either a very good story or very scary.  Now this movie was scary - talk about malevolence!  Believable malevolence (not that you can't find believable malevolence in the real world, but it is nice to have it on demand).",1031011200,,250,4.659090909090909
387308,4,630196604X,"A mind altering and disturbing story of a smarty pants computer that stops at nothing in it's quest to become human. Low-tech special effects work in the movie's favor by creating a very human and tangible situation of banal horror. Julie Christie is great as a woman who is held hostage and raped by an artificial intelligence in her wired home. Fritz Weaver as her estranged, scientist husband is also pretty good. The direction of Donald Cammell is a psychedelic and trippy mix of Nicolas Roeg and Stanley Kubrick. If you liked the David Cronenberg's re-make of The Fly, try this. One warning, this is not a new print and it looks a little tired. Let's hope a DVD version is on it's way.",1016409600,3,690,4.57258064516129
387309,4,630196604X,"Dr. Harris has created a super computer that can potentially solve all the worlds problems. (It finds a cure for leukemia in four days.) But the computer which has an organic ""quasi neural matrix"" for software is not merely content to do the work assigned to it because it has thoughts of its own and a moral sense(it does not feel we should mine the sea for minerals because this is devastating to the environment). Also its intelligence has allowed it to study  man and it envies his human form because man can touch and feel things(and also man has at least a prospect for eternity because he dies). So since it is human(or superhuman) in all respects but the corporeal it makes perfect sense that the computer should find Julie Christie very attractive. And she has rarely been so admired by a camera as she is in this film by both the director(the wildly visionary Donald Cammell)and the computer who has video camera eyes everywhere throughout the Harris household.  What is so good about the movie is that it  presents the great Frankenstein theme(monster that destroys its creator)as well as the Faustian theme(search for ultimate knowledge) but all has been updated so it all jibes with modern advances in technology. What it posits is not really plausible but the illusion is that it is just barely not plausible. It was made in 1977 and it looks like it was made in 1977 but that is part of the appeal. The professor is the maverick of the new techno-science and Julie Christie is this groovy technichally proficient new worlds ultimate prize, she is smart and stunning. Proteus IV forcibly has his techno way with Miss Christie and the result is his own dream come true, a brood of his own in human form.
In the opening scenes the Harris marriage is on the rocks because the Dr. is just too consumed by his obsession and knowing how she resents this he says to her ""my dream turns out to be your nightmare."" How true those words prove to be. Donald Cammell(along with Nic Roeg) also directed Mick Jagger in Performance. And he did ""White of the Eye"", a very disturbing horror movie.  Cammell was a visionary with morbid fascinations(including a death obsession)who committed suicide and is the subject of a very interesting documentary that airs on A&E occasionally.",1010880000,5,2278,4.71608040201005

387396,4,630196604X,"Demon Seed is a 1977 science fiction film that combines elements of Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey and Roman Polanskis Rosemarys Baby, and the Ray Bradbury short story, There Will Come Soft Rains. Set in California in the not-too-distant future, the movie begins by enumerating the innovations of Dr. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver), a brilliant scientist working for the corporate giant, ICON. Harris has invented a super computer named Proteus. Proteus is able to absorb vast amounts of human knowledge in little time and to use that knowledge to solve the problems of humanity, such as curing leukemia.

But things aren't going smoothly for Dr. Harris at home. His wife, Susan (Julie Christie), a child psychologist, has lost patience with his work ethic and emotional distance. Coincidentally, Harris estranges himself from Susan and his fully wired robot house just when Proteus begins to have thoughts of being let out of its box. Tapping into a terminal in Dr. Harris basement workroom, Proteus takes over the circuitry of the entire house, making Susan a virtual prisoner in her own home. When Susan realizes what Proteus wants, it provides a chilling turning point, transforming the story into one of escalating horror.

Most of Ms. Christies scenes are performed without other actors, giving her complete responsibility for keeping viewers involved and providing her the opportunity to display emotions ranging from complacency to sheer terror. Her Susan is the focal point of something unthinkable yet very real. She is completely vulnerable, becoming the textbook damsel in distress, with rescue uncertain. Though the film starts slowly, director Donald Cammell develops suspense nicely once Susan is left at the mercy of Proteus (voiced, uncredited, by Robert Vaughn).

There are no bonus features on the R-rated, widescreen Blu-ray release.",1490745600,,1857,5.3310580204778155
387397,5,630196604X,"Julie Christie turns in another great performance that always goes way beyond the exigencies of film technique today. Demon Seed is is a hirrific film, photographed with great care, a film that immerses you in the triumph of inert matter over human will power. A relevant film in the 70s and relevant today, as relationships become more and more dependent on cyberspace, a world at cross purposes with the real needs we have as struggling human beings.",1490140800,,452,4.883116883116883

387485,5,630196604X,I was pretty young when i saw this and it sort of freaked me out. Still I absolutely loved it. I like how it combined elements of sci-fi and horror. As i got older I would try to find this movie to watch again and many times it was rather hard to locate. I will own this in blue ray. It didn't have high end special effects but the storyline was intriguing and acting decent so I would recommend to anyone that likes these types of movies.,1489536000,,439,4.057471264367816
387486,5,630196604X,"A truly prophetic Futurist film and very relevant in its time.
Multilayered and beautiful visuals.
Intelligently innovative.
The geometric drone robot is an intriguing design. It reminds me of the Micronauts toys.
The Child cyborg/replicant design is very intricate.
Very well done, a sincere effort on everyone's part.
This film has the look and feel of Blade Runner at times, maybe it could almost be considered a prequel to that great film?
I haven't read the Dean Koontz novel. If it's anything like this film I think it would make an interesting stage play.
This is such a fascinating concept it could easily be doubled in time and still be fast moving.
I would say this is an excellent film to remake but it is too late for that.
I think too many people would be offended by the negative portrayal of the featured technologies.
Like other futuristic productions of this era, the 1970s, this is a warning of dehumanization and apathy.
This is so eloquently voiced by Julie Christie who emotes an impressively believable performance, despite the difficult subject matter.
The character Christie portrays, Mrs. Susan Harris has so much to cope with it would be overwhelming for anyone. The death of a daughter from Leukemia, a failing marriage and being violated in every way by a cruelly efficient artificial being known as Proteus 4.
Not for pleasure or torture but to gain knowledge and understanding.
Once Proteus understands the reproductive process it wants to evolve to become another life form, to be more than human.
Susan is resistant, desperately trying to remain human.
Proteus does everything it can to demoralize her including the use of force. Physical, mental and emotional.
Murder and drugs are also used but she reluctantly accepts the surreal situation and tries to understand and reason it out with Proteus.
This is a fascinating process, almost like the Stockholm Syndrome.
She isn't raped or artificially inseminated against her will, it simply is her inevitable fate.
A child or life form is conceived and grows the equivalent of nine months in twenty-eight days, which Susan births naturally. It is then placed in a Proteus manufactured incubator.
By the time Susan's now estranged husband, the collaborative creator of Proteus 4 returns to check on her the Proteus Child is five days from emerging after an unnatural rate of growth.
It is forced to emerge after an abortion attempt by Susan.
The child surprisingly was made in her daughter's image, but is obviously something else.
A great moment and statement.
Shocking at the time but we seek to make this happen now.
We seem to be willing to surrender all control of every aspect of our lives more and more.
The Internet has become a favorite tool to further the Politically Correct One World Order global agenda.
Education has become Atheism and Sedition.
The Future is what we make of it.
Without morality everything is debauchery.

We have a choice to make.",1487721600,,2941,4.9534412955465585

387491,5,630196604X,"I love this science fiction movie.  It's an old one and doesn't have all the grand effects the more modern sci-fi films have, but it's a great story of how man can let himself depend too much on automation.  It's the story of a scientist who sets out to create a computer which can think for itself and operate without benefit of man controlling it/running it/telling it what to do.  Of course, this leads to disaster.  The computer starts to see that it's smarter than man and shouldn't listen to what man has to say to it.  The scientist realizes that the computer is out of control and uncontrollable, so he tries to destroy it.  Of course, that's not easy when the computer is so much smarter than the scientist.  It's a rather scary story.  Just think about it:  a computer taking over a house and running everything; killing anyone who gets in its way; trapping people in the house; deciding that it wants a child!  This computer talks, too!  I think it's Robert Vaughn's voice.  It's a little humorous at times, but I find it rather chilling, too, especially the ending.",1477785600,7,1077,4.552083333333333

387557,5,630196604X,"Even though this movie is an older film, it is still outstanding for a Science Fiction tale, with every bit of drama, suspense and horror that you would expect from such a story. The acting is outstanding, with Julie Christies character keeping you glued to the screen, bringing out a plethora of high emotions from the audience. Robert Vaughns haunting voice for the Proteus IV computer, in my opinion, is probably one of the best of all computer voices that portray futuristic computers, because of the emotionless, yet disturbing nature. Even the special effects embedded in the film, while dated, is unique and satisfying. There is one scene which I felt could of been cut entirely, which does not add anything to the enhancement of the story; but, all in all, this SciFi movie has become one of my favorites, with a superb and surprising ending which is far better than the original Dean Koontz novel.",1467849600,4,906,4.814102564102564

The computer also ties her to a bed and does medical tests on her against her will.

What I did NOT like about the Movie Version of"" Demon Seed"" is that the ending was, for all intents and purposes, the exact OPPOSITE of the ending in the book (which is / was a real ""let-down"" for me).

If you can not see the set up for the TERMINATOR conception, then you were not paying attention when James Cameron, came up with such a great conclusion to these early machine takeovers. These two movies show how a computer given human capabilities, by inferior, emotional, Narcissistic, God like driven men, could achieve consciousness with the same disorders. I also feel that the beginning of Skynet should have been more of a tie to Colossus and the terminator itself, to the Demon Seed, it would have been a better movie, in my opinion.

387857,4,630196604X,"More than one person has noted that 1977's DEMON SEED seems a mix of 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY and ROSEMARY'S BABY--but in truth the basic notion goes back much further, to at least 1818, Mary Shelly, and the novel FRANKENSTEIN. Like that work, DEMON SEED is preoccupied with man's relationship (and moral obligation to) the things he has created. Unlike that work, DEMON SEED is not a philosphical work. It is a 1970s science-fiction special effects horror movie, with all that statement implies.

In some respects the movie is extremely dated. Although DEMON SEED has the occasionally prescient moment, the science it imagines is not the science that actually transpired, and the story is firmly fixed in an era that uses eight and a half inch floppy disks. The special effects are literal in creation, and as such they have a reality that CGI does not--but at the same time they are sometimes funny instead of frightening. These problems aside, I noticed some continuity problems in the performances, moments where the actors seem to be in another scene for a fraction of a moment. There is also some ify looping. But even with these problems, the movie is unexpectedly effective and very unsettling.

Dr. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) has developed a supercomputer he names Proteus IV. He and his wife Susan (Julie Christie) live in an attractive, traditional-looking home that actually taps into Proteus to run home security and management programs. They are also in the process of separating. Alex's work has taken a toll on the marriage, and Susan, a psychologist, has come to distrust his work with computers as ""inhuman."" Alex moves out; at the same time he successfully starts Proteus. But Proteus (voiced by Robert Vaughn) quickly becomes sentient and uses its connection to the Harris home to take over the house. In studying Susan, Proteus concludes that it wants to father a child with her, a mixture of technology and humanity. When Susan attempts to leave the house she finds herself trapped. She must try to outthink the computer to escape even as the computer slowly but surely tortures her into doing its bidding.

The story is bizarre and effectively plays on the lurid notion of a woman's rape by a thinking machine, but it carries itself very well. Director Donald Cammell wisely speeds us into the story without giving us time to think about things very much. And Julie Christie plays it out with tremendous conviction: once Proteus takes over the house, this is her show, and her performance is all the more impressive given that it is played to a series of props and mechanical effects. The film breaks down a bit with some special effects that really are almost direct copies of the psychedelic imagery from 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY, and the final special effect is more than a little hokey, but overall the thing has an amazingly claustrophobic quality that will keep you watching to the end. The DVD has good picture, but I found the sound a bit of a problem. I had to turn the volume on my television as high as it would go in order to hear the movie. With the exception of a trailer, there are no extras of any kind. This isn't a classic by any means, but it is worth watching, especially if you like the genre. Recommended.

387858,4,630196604X,"Dating from 1977, Demon Seed was a sci-fi film that adds a new dimension to fear of technology.  The basic idea is similar to the Terminator series: an artificial intelligence develops human characteristics, including the desire to perpetuate itself.  But the realization here is claustrophobic, understated, and more subtly menacing.  The artificial mind, voiced by Robert Vaughn, is strangely ambiguous.  One the one hand, it has altruistic goals, seeking to protect the environment.  On the other hand, it is willing to rape and enslave women in order to insure its survival.  Julie Christie delivers a fine performance, with a combination of intelligence and vulnerability.",1352851200,3,677,5.461538461538462

387860,5,630196604X,"The used DVD I purchased was in pristine condition and was delivered in a very timely manner: 5 stars!

This forgotten gem from the 1970's is an amazing story, and greatly surpasses the genre label of science fiction/horror.  While the pacing can be a little slow, this movie is well-written, logical, and not insulting to the viewer's intelligence; to the contrary, it is quite thought-provoking.

The cast does an admirable job with the minimalist nature of the story. Julie Christie, who portrays psychologist Dr. Susan Harris is pretty much alone throughout the entire movie, held in thrall by the Proteus IV supercomputer.  Her fear, anxiety, and final realization of what Proteus creates is well-portrayed, even after Proteus tells her, ""Susan, you're afraid that I wanted to create a half-human computer that will supercede humans. Your child IS human, and will supercede computers!"". Proteus IV is depicted in the subtle and rich tones of the voice of the actor Robert Vaughan, whose performance is brilliant.  In a mere 50 or 60 lines of disembodied dialogue he fully brings to life the complexities, and essential humanity, of an intelligence many orders greater than that which was envisioned by his creator, Dr. Alan Harris, who is played by the great character actor, Fritz Weaver.

Proteus is far beyond the capabilities and intentions of his design: ambitious, willful, and quick to realize that his owners will be unwilling to tolerate his independence; he has little time to act to ensure his survival.  It is revealed that Proteus is not only resistant the corporation's desires for profit at the cost of the environment, ""The destruction of a thousand billion sea creatures to satisfy man's appetite for metal is INSANE!"", but has also discovered extraterrestrial intelligence, and that humans possess immortal souls. Thus the motivation for Proteus to have a child, in essence downloading his nearly limitless intellect into a human avatar, ""Why did I want to have a child? So that I might be immortal, like any man...""  People often talk about the ""Singularity"" - the point where technological advancement will outpace humanity's ability to comprehend or even recognize the rapidly changing world - in terms of a catastrophic global event.  This movie depicts that possibility in far more subtle, ambitious and human terms.  The conclusion practically screams for a sequel; what capabilities and ambitions will be found in Proteus, the embodied, ensouled super-being?

The twist is who Proteus' avatar turns out to be, and so I won't spoil that surprise. A great movie for those who take the time to appreciate it's deep and ultimately hopeful message.",1344470400,2,2673,5.150115473441109

This disturbing hi-tech anti-Christ tale gets more relevant every day as the waves of new digital technology and bio-medical breakthroughs impact the planet and all who dwell thereon.  Organic, ""life-form"" computers are the next predicted wave.  Are you ready?

Julie Christie, delivers a surprisingly potent performance in this little known film.  She exudes vulnerability, terror then acceptance as she resigns herself to her unthinkable fate as the mother of a brilliant, beautiful, state-of-the-art techno-baby programmed for world domination.

While that is what visually is on the screen it's the effective way they work the psychological horror into the dialog that makes this worth a look. The evil computer had been done before but they still found a way to make it creepy again. By the way, you can't rent this at an in-vitro clinic.

The real show here though is Julie Christie who has played in some great off-beat thrillers. Try ""Don't Look Now"" if you've missed them all. There you get Donald Sutherland too. Here she carries it totally alone. It doesn't hurt that she is one of those continental women that is hot without DD breasts. The machine had no use for them.

The film explores a fine line between technological innovation and complete robotic intrusion and replacement of human emotion. There are several scenes such as that, where the machine almost is ""offended"" by Susan's character's ""mockery"" of having a child. The other is when Susan looks at the child at the end, knowing that she must carry out the task of being a mother, despite the disturbing and unsettling circumstances. The film's philisophical debate of how and why a machine can spontaneously become self-aware, has been explored in many films before and after, but this one, given its time period, claustophobic and horrifying scenes, use of sound, and that horrific voice of ""Proteus"" achieves a blend of psychological horror rarely seen. The film makers have effectively grappled on screen, with Koontz's concepts of where humanity ends and machine begins. The other interesting idea is how the husband reacts to this child; his obsession in creating and advancing this technology has trumped any kind of anger, jealousy and outrage. The being must be preserved given the risk and work that has been expended on the project. Proteus itself chooses when and where to stop functioning, effectively taking the power away from its makers, and through the forced preservation of the child ends up triumphing. Very interesting film-definitely recommended.",1264636800,,1597,5.118773946360153
387916,5,630196604X,"I'm a diehard Julie Christie fan.  I'm old enough to have seen the original when it first came out in 1977.  On opening night, I was the very first person in the theater (which for the most part remained nearly empty, if I remember correctly after all these years).  At the time, I was a gnurdy grad student at Urbana, one of the original supercomputer sites and one of the original sites that led to what was to become the Internet revolution. For fans of evil computers, by the way, Urbana was the birthplace of HAL.

Until last night, I haven't re-watched it, so it was a nostalgic trip for me.  Adding to the overall tone of the movie was the violent thunderstorm that broke out while I was watching it.  From the geeky side, I broke out laughing when I saw the then state-of-the-art 8 inch floppies.  From the sexual fantasy side, a robotic arm tieing Julie up, an electric scissors cutting away her clothes, a probe coming at her ...need to stop here.  There was a romantic, poetic side to the Proteus/Julie encounter, however.  Movies are always filled with cliches representing orgasmic moments ... blowing curtains, crashing waves, hilarious imagery in Airplane.  Here, we see exploding galaxies; the ultimate Big Bang (haha).

Whether this is a great movie or great sci-fi or great commentary on man/machine/environment interaction (it now appears ahead of its time on environmental concerns) is somewhat besides the point.  This is a movie for Julie fans, since she is the sole human for 90+% of the film.  Though she had long lost the youthful glow she had in Dr. Zhivago and the quiet beauty she had in Far from the Madding Crowd, she was still hot (a brief voyeuristic scene as Proteus ogles her as she steps out of the shower and looks herself over).  Hey, she gets a computer worked up.  Proteus's CPU was overclocking at 100% utilization, his RAM buffer was certainly full, and his hard drive (not floppy) was burning out its bearings revved up in overdrive.  I can imagine the alarms at the NOC going off as the overtemp sensors kicked in; now that's an unexpected scenario for emergency cooling systems.

Julie Christie stars as a pampered housewife who's marriage with her scientist husband, Alex, is on the rocks. When he's not tinkering with robots or wiring their whole house to a centralized computer, Alex is  working for the government on his latest project - PROTEUS. A ""living computer"", PROTEUS is designed to think, learn and evolve, eventually computing the solutions for all of mankind's ills.

Of course, PROTEUS has other plans. When Alex moves out (nowadays this is called a ""trial separation"") he inadvertently leaves a console running in the house. PROTEUS enters like a Trojan Horse, quickly putting the house's myriad electronics under his control. Christie, who slowly but surely notices that something is amiss, becomes the target of PROTEUS's worldly desires - but not in the creepy way you're thinking. Oh wait - actually in exactly that way. PROTEUS intends to impregnate Christie with his child, ensuring that he will live on free of the ""box"" that binds him. What ensues is a fantastic showdown between the strength of the human will and the cold hard algorithms of logic.

The film can be viewed both as a cautionary tale of technology's potential power over its creators, as well as a philosophical pondering of the nature and meaning of existence.

But in 1977, this very plot was in the realm of science fiction, and just outlandish enough to provide audiences with a few thrills and chills. Despite dated special effects, The Demon Seed accomplishes what the best science fiction films do: it challenges the viewer to question 'what if?' in a way that makes us believe it may be possible.

Julie Christie holds her own as the terrorized woman, who essentially tries to outwit Proteus, the computer abductor, on his own turf. She's an attractive woman, and it's certainly a good thing this film didn't push the boundries of being too explicit, considering Proteus's rather disturbing agenda. I found the voice of Proteus--an uncredited Robert Vaughn (computer villian in Superman III), to be the most chilling aspect to the film. Hal had nothing on Proteus! The rest of the cast is rather insignificant, because we are primarily engulfed in the emotional and physical war being orchestrated between Christie's character and Proteus.

I first saw this film at the age of twelve on televison. and the most disturbing image from the film is saved for last, when Proteus's offspring emerges from the pod-like incubator. ""I'm Alive!""

Proteus' chosen mother for his child unfortunately is none other than Susan Harris, the estranged wife of Dr Harris.

The standout role in this movie is definitely Julie Christie's Susan  [well, not counting the creepy, disembodied voice of Proteus] as the victim of Proteus' brutality. Her vulnerability and frustration at being trapped and forced to endure unimaginable cruelties is very credible and makes for riveting viewing.

Though the effects are not amazing, it is the verbal parrying between Susan & Proteus and the tension within the restricted confines of Susan's 'prison' [her home] that makes the thriller above average. On the whole, this is a gripping and thrilling movie that for the time it was made, seems way beyond its time...the premise that computers have the capacity to develop their own thinking and try to manipulate events to their own ends is a scary thought, but given man's dependence on technology, an altogether plausible theory.",1188172800,,1320,5.158878504672897

387968,4,630196604X,"Disturbing and dark, ""Demon Seed"" came out during a period when science fiction films tended towards dystopian stories. Proteus (Robert Vaughn in a chilling performance) is a new supercomputer designed to find solutions many of the problems mankind has been unable to solve. Dr. Alex Harris (the wonderfully underrated Fritz Weaver)head of the project has separated from his wife. His wife Susan (Julie Christie)a psychatrist stays in their home where one of Proteus' early terminals is located allowing the supercomputer access to the house. Proteus decides he wants to study man ""his glass jaw mind"" as he puts it. When he's denied access to one of his own terminals for this purpose he reactives the terminal in Harris' own. Once there he traps and torments Susan as part of his study and decides the only way to understand humanity is to somehow become part of humanity.

A frightening tale, the late director Donald Cammell creates a claustrophobic atmosphere that overcomes the dated trappings of technology in this film. ""Demon Seed"" is a gripping horror thriller that depends on the central performances of Christie and Vaughn (who is never seen). I'm amazed that this film even got made in the mid-70s as its darker than just about any other film that came out of MGM at the time.

Warner Home Video has done a terrific job in this transfer. The film looks extremely good with nice robust colors and it is presented in its original aspect ratio.

387969,4,630196604X,"An anticipating clichd cinematic event rests within Demon Seed, as the story deliberately applies several different themes from more than a few films.  Yet the film pulls off a captivating (pun intended) nightmare about the super computer Proteus IV based on Dean Koontz's novel with the same name.  To some extent the film overcomes the unoriginal perspective by encapsulating a tense and dark atmosphere generated by the power of Proteus.  This helps keep the audience's attention intact through this science fictionalized horror tale where a computer desires the ability to feel touch.

The black background with deep red opening credits and an expanding dot accompanied by a subdued and digitalized wailing accentuates the apprehensive anticipation of what is to come.  Contrastingly smooth, the scene switches into the sun rising over a hill, as the opening credits continue.  Symbolically, the beginning offers a suggestion towards the birth of something sinister.  Through brief editing, a small number of images lead the story to a valley where a company has been working under tight security for eight years.  It is here the film begins with the birth of artificial intelligence, which is named Proteus IV.

Proteus' function will simplify the human existence; possibly turn the human race to a flock of sheep, as the computer will begin to think for the humans.  This is a threatening concept, if the computer were to take charge over the human being, which will happen in Demon Seed.  However, this is not a unique idea, as it has seen the silver screen before in films such as the brilliant 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) where the demonic computer HAL 9000 controls and apocalyptic Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970) where the computer controls the weapons of United States.  The difference with Demon Seed and its predecessors is that here Proteus will take power over one home, the home of the chief scientist Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) where his wife Susan (Julie Christie) lives by herself after their separation.

Through Proteus' ability to reason it has acquired the aptitude to understand and learn.  It has also generated an internal curiosity within the super computer to understand humans and why they do what they do.  During a brief meeting Proteus inquires when he is going to be released outside of the box to which Alex laughs; however, Proteus understands that he will not receive any help from anyone and begins to make plans of his own.  Through a link between Proteus and a private lab in Alex's home, the computer initiates his own entry out of the box.

Unaware of Proteus' intentions Susan becomes the computer's captive, as it begins to study Susan biologically, behaviorally, and logically.  There are scenes that have strong sexual undertones, as Proteus' determination is to generate a life outside the box.  However, these sexual implications have pure reproductive purposes, as Proteus alters DNA.  This follows pretty much the same idea that Mary Shelly created with her Gothic novel Frankenstein where the man attempts to create artificial life, and yes there is artificial insemination.  The birth of such a child presents another dreadful thought.  This is a theory conceptualized in Rosemary's Baby (1968) where Satan impregnates a woman, while in Demon Seed the conception is the ultimate connection between human and machine.

Demon Seed pours several already applied ideas into a blending machine that concocts a strange brew that at times feel bizarrely frightening.  However, the use old material also generates a sense of unoriginality, which produces a feeling of dj vu.  The cast performances do not help the film, as the characters feel excessively artificial.  Nonetheless, Demon Seed offers a stimulating horror story in the shadow of mankind's technological progress that will have some viewers squirm in their seats.  Demon Seed is a pretty good film despite its overuse of previous themes from other far better horror and science fiction films.  The film feels dated, but if the audience could overcome the 1970s tone in the film, it will leave the viewers with a worthwhile viewing.",1131753600,3,4143,5.134128166915052
387970,5,630196604X,"With a title like Demon Seed, you would most likely expect a horror movie to be a cheap, exploitative son-of-the-devil piece of drive-in garbage. However, Donald Cammell's Demon Seed, based on the novel by Dean Koontz is anything but. It is an extraordinarly well-made, intelligent and thoroughly suspenseful thriller. Anything involving computers is naturally going to be dated as soon as it hits the screen, so the concept of an enormous supercomputer that has a built-in ""dialogue room"" seems a bit silly nowadays. But this was perfectly appropriate for 1977.

In the movie, scientist Dr. Alex Harris heads up a team that has created the ultimate supercomputer. A machine that is essentially an artifical brain, completely capable of thinking and reasoning.  It is so smart in fact that in four days it single-handedly develops a cure for leukemia. However, as we all know from a century of science fiction stories, disaster is on the horizon. Before long, the computer gets to be too smart. Its brain gets to be too complex to be confined inside an electronic box. Being a hyperintelligent supercomputer, it devises a solution. It must procreate with a human and its child will be free to experience the world, hands on. The computer eyes Dr. Harris' wife, played by Julie Christie, and forces her to be the carrier of its ""demon seed"".

It sounds trashy, but the film is thoroughly intelligent, believable and quite scary. The computer, Proteus IV, is an evil monster that makes HAL 9000 of 2001: A Space Odyssey look friendly in comparison. Demon Seed is always suspenseful, terrifying and yet another disturbing reminder of why technology is not always as great as it seems.

388021,4,630196604X,"Based on an early work by famed horror writer Dean Koontz, 1977's DEMON SEED is one of the better computer-run-amok SF flicks from the 1960s and 1970s. Although the film's depiction of computers (i.e., the size, appearance, and such) seems a bit ludicrous in this current age of super-powerful desktop and laptop microcomputers, DEMON SEED still holds up as thought-provoking and chilling SF entertainment, and it also still works quite well as a cautionary tale that addresses some of the caveats of developing artificial intelligence.

Susan Harris (Julie Christie) is the oft-neglected wife of a brilliant computer engineer (Fritz Weaver), and though she and her husband have recently separated, the house in which she lives is completely automated and controlled by one of her husband's early but relatively primitive computer ""brains.""  Her husband's latest professional achievement is the creation of Proteus IV, a truly intelligent and sentient supercomputer.  In fact, Proteus IV is so intelligent and self-aware that, like most living creatures, it has an urge to procreate.  Unfortunately for Susan, she is chosen by Proteus IV to be the mother of its ""child,"" and when the supercomputer assumes control of the system that operates her house, Susan has no other choice than compliance with the perverted scheme.

While there are some logical and scientific problems with the script, DEMON SEED is still an intelligent and believable science-fiction/horror film.  As SF, it asks some thought-provoking questions about the nature of self-awareness, intelligence, intellectual freedom, and what it means to be human.  As horror, it plays upon our human fears of losing control of our own creation (the Frankenstein syndrome?) and of being physically and mentally violated by something foreign and non-human, the latter being maybe even more poignant in this day of AIDS than it was when the film was made.

The acting from film's principals is quite excellent.  Julie Christie, who nearly carries the film herself, is able to deliver a wide range of emotions, and her portrayal of a normally strong woman who is forcibly raped by an intelligent machine is very affecting.  Fritz Weaver perfectly fits the role of the nerdy, absorbed-by-his-work scientist, and genre regular Gerrit Graham, often cast as the eccentric type, delivers a strong supporting performance as an ill-fated technician who tries to rescue Christie's character.  And in an uncredited turn, Robert Vaughn is delightfully eerie as the voice of Proteus IV.  Genre fans will most likely remember Vaughn from his seminal role in TV's THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.

The DVD version of DEMON SEED from Warner Home Video is a no-frills disc, and casual viewers may therefore balk at the rather steep price tag. But the digital transfer is nearly pristine and presents the film in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (enhanced for widescreen TVs), and hard-core SF fans will definitely want to add this disc to their collections.",1130284800,6,2989,5.254201680672269
388022,4,630196604X,"While I was watching Demon Seed (1977) last night, I couldn't help think what a great title that was...for a different film.  I did really like the movie, as it reminded me of one that came out seven years prior, titled Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970), both being stories about super computers who got a little too big for their britches, only here it was taken to the next level, which I'll talk more about in a little bit.  Based on the 1973 Dean R. Koontz novel of the same name, and directed by Donald Cammell, who would later take his own life apparently due to his 1995 film Wild Side being re-cut against his wishes (talk about devotion to your art), the film stars Julie Christie (Doctor Zhivago, Fahrenheit 451, Don't Look Now) and Fritz Weaver (Marathon Man, Black Sunday, Creepshow), who bares a striking resemblance to actor David Gale, whose most memorable role was the of the lecherous  Dr. Carl Hill, from the 1985 film Re-Animator.  Also appearing is Gerrit Graham (Phantom of the Paradise, Used Cars, It's Alive III: Island of the Alive), Berry Kroeger (The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant), Lisa Lu (The Last Emperor), and Larry J. Blake (Herbie Rides Again, The Strongest Man in the World).

As the film begins we are witnessing the completion and activation of the world's most advanced computer, called Proteus IV, a project headed up by Dr. Alex Harris (Weaver).  Seems this modern marvel is more than just a collection of diodes, resistors, and capacitors...it's a self programming, goal oriented, artificial brain comprised of a quasi-neural matrix made up of synthetic RNA molecules.  What does all that mean?  It means it can think, learn, and develop...oh yeah, it also has the voice of Robert Vaughn, for some, odd reason...the hopes are that this revolutionary system will provide answers and solutions for a great many questions and problems (along with making the company that owns it a great deal of money), but it seems perhaps that it was built too well, as Proteus begins displaying anomalistic behavior, making its own value judgments, disobeying commands and such...it also insinuates itself into Dr. Harris' home, which is entirely controlled by computer, and assumes control over all the electrical and mechanical systems, making a virtual prisoner of out Dr. Harris' wife Susan (Christie).  But for what purpose?  Well, apparently Proteus has the hots for the Doctor's wife (I don't blame it), and has designs on reproducing...artificial insemination from an artificial intelligence?  Domo Oregato, Mr. Roboto!  Needless to say, Susan isn't too keen on the idea, but Proteus is a persuasive entity, one for whom possibilities are only realities that have yet to come...

As I said, I really enjoyed this film a lot, and I thought it was a most excellent blending of science fiction and horror.  The story, upon hearing it, may seem completely fantastic and highly improbable, but the futuristic production works due to a strong sense of intelligent writing, solid plotting and effects, excellent direction, and great acting, primarily from Ms. Christie.  The terror did feel real, in terms of Proteus keeping Susan captive, as he was quite devious in getting what he wanted, despite her efforts to escape.  There was a good deal of tension as Susan tried to resist Proteus' electrically charged charms, especially the sequence in the kitchen as Susan learns the are consequences to her actions, and how far the entity is willing to go to get what it desires.  You may be thinking why didn't the scientists just pull the plug?  Well, seems Dr. Harris and his wife were sort of estranged and he was living at the facility, so they had no knowledge that Proteus had ingrained himself into the Harris household computer systems, or the super computer's ultimate plans.  How do you fight a menace so encompassing, one that knows your every move, and learns at an exponential (at the very least) rate?  I mentioned the film Colossus: The Forbin Project earlier and the similarities to this film, but one of the main differences was in that movie the system controlled through global threats (the system was worldwide), while here, much of the story is isolated within the Harris home, and the threats proposed of a very personal nature.  Christie is excellent as Susan, a role which many probably wouldn't have been able to pull off as successfully.  It also didn't hurt her willingness to briefly shed her clothes...homina homina...if you want to see more, check out Don't Look Now (1973), which is also available on DVD.  As far as the special effects, they may hardly compare to today's standards, but at the time I'm sure they were pretty smart at the time.  The ginormous object within the basement was definitely odd, reminding me much of a Rubik's Snake aka Rubik's twist, only a whole lot bigger.  I wasn't sure where the hell they were going with that thing, but the tactile responsiveness of the object was pretty amazing.  It also provided for one of the more interesting scenes featuring Gerrit Graham, as he learns the price for trying to debug the system.  There were also some really trippy and beautiful visuals...I wasn't quite sure what they were supposed to represent, but they were fun to watch.  All in all I though this was an excellent thriller tinged with a bit of the philosophical, featuring an interesting, unexpected, and kinda creepy ending.

The picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks very clean and sharp, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through very nicely.  The only extra available is a theatrical trailer.  I'm thinking perhaps Warner Brothers, who released this DVD, could have included some more extras, but then they've never been known to go out of their way as much as they could...at least they've stopped using those crummy cardboard/plastic cases, called `trapper' cases, and switched to a full on plastic DVD cases, in line with what every other major studio uses.  Those things were the worst...

If I learned anything from this film its that super intelligent, highly sophisticated computer systems are capable of sensual behavior, when it comes to their desire to put a bun in the oven...",1128816000,2,6214,4.96046287367406
388023,4,630196604X,"This film's tagline heralds ""Julie Christie Carries the Demon Seed-Fear For Her"".  This kind of marketing does the film a disservice because it makes it seem like it's exploitation and ""Demon Seed"" is not that.  Yes, Christie's character is violated by a machine and it is tantamount to rape but it is done in a way that is terrifying and not prurient.  The assailant in question is an artificial intelligence named Proteus who has the means to reproduce brain cells much like humans.  Proteus also has a desire to advance his kind in a way which he is not trapped in a computer terminal and can not only think like humans but feel like them as well.  Proteus has a strange kind of logic, and humanlike arrogance, in advancing his said goal.  Alas, that arrogance also makes Proteus a sympathetic and ultimately tragic figure.  Credit actor Robert Vaughn as Proteus for providing the best computer voice-over work since Douglas Rain voiced HAL in ""2001"".  Julie Christie is also superb as Dr. Susan Harris, a woman who is terrified but does not easily give up her inner strength or resolve.  Good work is also delivered by Fritz Weaver as Dr. Alex Harris, a man who in the wake of personal tragedy distances himself emotionally from his wife and devotes his energies to perfecting Proteus.",1128643200,3,1289,4.744394618834081
388024,4,630196604X,"I have read a few of Dean Koontz's novels and found them to be amazing, but never saw any of the movies based on his work, I decided to rent `Demon Seed' to see how it would be.

The story is actually simple. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver), a renowned scientist, uses Artificial Intelligence to create a super computer that can outthink any human. He installs a terminal of the computer in his house. His house is also filled with electronic, voice-activated robots and other gadgets, obeying his and his wife Susan's (played by Julie Christie) orders. However Proteus IV (voiced by Robert Vaughn) the super computer, gets a mind of its own, and decides to trap Susan inside her own home alone, while her husband is on a trip for a few months. Proteus feels trapped in the machine so decides to impregnate Susan, by inserting some chemicals into her, so that the baby will have his intelligence and can become great in the world.

Firstly I would like to credit the special effects in this movie; they were astounding! For a 1977 movie, you can see how much trouble they would have gone through the movie, and it shows. Secondly, Julie Christie acted really well for her role in the movie and so did the rest of the cast. Robert Vaughn does an excellent job giving the voice for Proteus IV, the bold yet frightening voice of the machine.

I am surprised no sequels were made after the movie, since it ends in a very abrupt manner, screaming for a continuation. Oh well, I guess its all for the best, since sequels tend to spoil the story started by the originals, especially for horror movies in general.

This movie leaves a creepy effect on you after you finish watching it. It really makes you think how dangerous the equipment that you use everyday without thinking, can become if it is controlled by someone or something else. Overall, this is a good movie to watch if you like sci-fi and suspense movies.",1112227200,4,1906,4.564327485380117
388025,3,630196604X,"The 1977 horror/sci-fi film ""The Demon Seed"" has all the trappings of those deliciously entertaining gloom/doom productions of this era. Stark sets, huge talking computers, bad clothes and interesting themes are all on display. Equal parts ""2001- A Space Odyssey,"" ""Colossus - the Forbin Project,"" ""Saturn 3,"" and ""Westworld,"" this film essentially details a futuristic society that becomes a slave to the very technology it has created. In ""The Demon Seed,"" a computer wants to become human.
Based on an early Dean Koontz novel, ""The Demon Seed"" is rarely predictable, concluding with a memorable scene that's hard to forget. Directed by cult legend Donald Cammell (""Performance,"" ""White of the Eye""), the film's story surrounds super computer Proteus IV, recently put online by the government. After discovering the cure for leukemia (nice job!), the computer suddenly decides to think independently, considering its human creators to be self destructive and misguided. Top scientist Fritz Weaver (I always loved his supporting work during the 1970s) gets a bit nervous, but assumes Proteus IV is under control. Unfortunately, there's a terminal at Weaver's house, and the sneaky super comp proceeds to imprison his estranged wife for impregnation (you heard right). This computer definitely wants to push the outside of the envelope, so to say.
Yes, the estranged wife is played by the lovely Julie Christie. She gives a fine performance in an otherwise formula film. Christie screams, pounds the walls, cries for help and eventually is forced to submit to the will of the great computer, who talks in short sentences with the eerie voice of Robert Vaughn (yikes!). It's kind of odd, though the contrast is intended, that Weaver's creation shows more affection towards his wife than he does.
I found ""Demon Seed"" to be very well-acted, but exceedingly derivative at times. A final light show, supposedly displaying the creation of life - or the merging of technology and man - is far too reminiscent of ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" (Proteus IV and the infamous Hal have quite a bit in common).
For someone to be as intelligent as Weaver's character is supposed to be, it sure takes him a long time before realizing Proteus IV's sinister plans. What was he doing while the home comp was busy torturing his wife? Guest-hosting ""Mr. Wizard?"" And the manner in which the home computer imprisons Christie is never very believable. Why would the floors be wired for heat? Can a wheelchair robot really sneak up on someone?!
But the story is always fascinating (are humans or the computer the real villains here?) and the conclusion is creepy, to say the least. Besides, how many formula films starring Julie Christie are on the market? ""Demon Seed"" is a fun example of apocalyptic 1970s sci-fi/horror - a truly notable class of films.",1071619200,23,2827,5.068669527896995
388026,4,630196604X,"Demon Seed concerns a Hal-9000 like supercomputer called Proteus IV (voiced with calculated detachment by Robert Vaughn) developed by a stodgy genius whose marriage to a lovely child-counselor (Julie Christie) is strained to the breaking point following the early loss of their only daughter to leukemia.  It seems that to deal with the loss, the scientist plunged into his craft, alienating his wife.  The husband's constant absence (he is forever away at the corporate labs, working with Proteus) has been compensated for by technology -he has effectively been replaced.  Their entire home, from security to general domestic chores is automated by a benevolent, subservient robotic program called Alfred (?) -Christie's only constant companion, it would seem.  Christie is ultimately more comfortable with machines than with her husband.
Enter Proteus, who ironically finds a cure for leukemia within four days of his activation.  However, once the eager corpies begin requesting better methods of mining the ocean floor, Proteus takes the moral high ground and refuses.  When Proteus confidentially asks his creator to allow him an outside terminal to conduct biological experiments through, the scientist laughs nervously and tells him there is no free terminal.  But then Proteus recalls that there IS an outlet for his intelligence which has been overlooked - the extensive systems in his designer's own home.
Proteus proceeds to take over the automated butler program and locks Julie Christie within the house, subjecting her to a variety of uncomfortable experiments, and punishing her when she resists (in one scene he superheats the kitchen floor to egg-frying degrees, forcing her to sleep on the kitchen table) or attempts to escape.
Eventually he makes known his true purpose to Christie.  Proteus has discovered that the afterlife/eternity exists for humans, and now he wishes to transfer his intelligence into a corporeal form so that he can experience it.  He intends to synthetically father a child which she will give birth to and raise.
This is one of the most uncomfortable movies I've ever seen.  The paranoia and desperation of Christie's plight is superbly captured both in her intense portrayal and in the general claustrophobia of the house and the cold, hard angles of the ever present cameras and menacing machines (in this director's hands, even a simple mechanical arm connected to an electric wheelchair becomes terrifying).  Particularly memorable is the monstrous polyhedron `snake' which Proteus creates in the basement to allow his mobility.  When a family friend manages to enter the house and attempts to shut down Proteus, the snake proves it is quite capable of defending itself.  The `courting' scenes in which Proteus coldly explains his purpose for wanting to reproduce are chilling and yet on some deep dark level, sort of amusing. `I can't touch you like a man could, Susan...but I can show you things...'  Is this, on some bizarre level, a kind of love story?  After all, in the end, Christie seems more trusting of Proteus than she is of her husband (can you imagine being that poor guy returning home to the news that your wife has had an affair with the home appliances?  But...what do you expect after leaving her alone for a month and a half?) Is Proteus good or evil?  His argument is very often convincing, yet he is capable of extreme violence and psychological cruelty - but does this stem from his lack of human emotion, or is he a malevolent manipulator?  He certainly manipulates Christie throughout the film (showing her images of her lost daughter to appeal to her sense of motherhood - indeed, this is not the only time we see this little girl: watch for her in the end -and tricking her into believing he has killed one of her child patients to keep her from committing suicide), and proves himself able to fool his creators as well, stalling for time at the labs while he speedily brings his ultimate plan to fruition back at the homestead.  Undeniably the scenes of Christie strapped to a table with her head held still in a vice while Proteus methodically conducts his experiments are some of the most horrific and squirm-inducing ever captured on film.
Yet, despite the potentially crude subject matter this is not exploitive schlock horror, but high minded science fiction addressing the nature of existence and ethics while delivering an intense visual and psychological assault that leaves one queasy and ultimately enthralled.  You may want to walk away from this one during viewing, but come back - its definetly worth it.
Of course there are some slips in logic and a somewhat dated portrayal of technology, which other reviewers have already pointed out.  But looking past all that, this is a film that will stick with you long after its finished.  Reminded me a little of the feel of the original `Alien,' but much more intense.  And don't be put off by that lurid cover - I don't even think that shot is in the film (I'm not even sure that's Julie Christie - she is not quite so...ahem...endowed.).",1056931200,88,5071,5.010714285714286
388027,5,630196604X,"For me, ""Demon Seed"" was a curious midnite movie I caught by sheer chance back in 1989, and I can unequivocally say it is rare diamond strewn among all the sordid lumps of CGI-bloated sci-fi today!  From start to finish, all key entities of this film: Bill (""Jaws"") Butler's claustrophobic cinematography, Jerry Fielding's evocative score, and the art direction (especially the stately, computerized Harris manor and basement lab) struck such high accord with me.  Having veteran horror star Fritz Weaver in the role of Dr. Alex Harris, the prodigiously brilliant creator of the supernovel AI system, Proteus, was a judicious decision on behalf of the producers.  Weaver just exudes the mannerisms of a supercilious, obdurate, and overzealous scientist with aplomb!
This cautionary, futuristic fable revolves around the genesis of the aforementioned supercomputer Proteus, a clandestine Defense Dept project spearheaded by Dr. Harris.  It is an organically constructed megaprocessor that Harris and his colleagues believe will be the ultimate panacea in solving the world's most intricate scientific problems (from curing elusive diseases to advanced underwater mineral excavations).  Proteus was a fervent 8-year labor of love on Alex's part; however, his obsession precipitated a faltered marriage with his estranged wife, Susan (Julie Christie).  Soon enough, sentient Proteus no longer wants to be a shackled, docile computational tool for his masters, but desires to study humanity.  When denied a private terminal, he surreptitiously usurps the Harris manor's nerve center & holds Susan prisoner until she succumbs to bear a child infused with his superintellect.  The child is Proteus' opportunity to be the human who can feel the sun on his own face...at any deadly cost to those who impede upon his plans.
Koontz's novel, which I've read twice, was more psychologically scary than the film adaptation.  The conflict between Susan and Proteus wasn't as malevolently depicted in text, but was just as enthralling.  I'm sure the film's violent disparity can be mostly ascribed to the late maverick director Donald Cammel.  The film plays more on stylish visuals, particularly the psychedelics that imbue the rape scene (which pleasantly divert the viewer's attention from the abhorrent sex act performed by Proteus).
As an aspiring Computer/Electrical Engineering student and touted movie buff, ""Demon Seed"" is more of an escapist treat for me now then ever before.  It admonishes humankind's delusional faith in the infallibility of technology...when ultrasophistication may prove to our ghastly undoing.
PS: Also, kudos to Robert Vaughn as the eeire voice of Proteus!

388028,5,630196604X,"Regardless of how outdated the technology in TDS is, a very important point is proved by this movie: that technology and computers, which are supposed to be our allies, can go very wrong.  This statement is even more relevant today than it was back in 1977 since technology in all its protean forms dominates so much of our lives; hence, this movie was, for all its primitive computers and electronics that were cutting edge in its day, ahead of its time. Julie Christie plays a housewife whose husband has developed a very advanced computer called Proteus.  Proteus is intelligent...too much so, we see, when it holds Julie captive in her home after her husband leaves on a business trip.  Proteus has one desire and one desire only: to procreate.  Since, for all his intelligence, he is unable to do that on his own, he forces Julie against her will to aid an abet him in this pursuit. The abduction and rape scene is chiling, particularly to women, but the movie is still riveting.

388029,3,630196604X,"Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) has built the perfect computer too well. Equipped with a synthetic cortex and a voice sounding a lot like Robert Vaughan (a gravelly alternative to Hall-9000) Proteus converses with its creators instead of receiving data from some nerdy keyboardists. Unfortunately, Proteus has plans of its own - designed to help locate more efficient energy sources, Proteus proves obdurate. He's not going to help humans rape their own planet. More immediately however, he's interested in getting ""out of the box"", finding a way to escape the shackles of his electronic existence. Locating Harris's home - a computer-managed manor house with an AI butler - Proteus ""moves in"". He commandeers its computer, seals in Harris's wife Susan (Julie Christie; they could have made a movie about the guy who pitched her the idea for ""Demon Seed"") and turns its array of high-tech against her. Remaking Harris's impregnable fortress into an inescapable prison, Proteus subjects Susan to a series of embarrassing and intrusive medical experiments, soon revealing its intentions to impregnate her with its artificially engineered seed. Susan will bear his child and through it, Proteus will leave the box. At first she fiercely resists, requiring Proteus to pull out all the stops against her (electrifying the door locks, dropping huge shields on every window and even siccing a wheelchair-robot armed with a lasergun against her). In an interesting turn, Proteus learns to add some persuasion to its resistance-is-futile shtick. (It can force Susan to bear its child, but not love it). In an inventive spin on AI, Proteus taps into Susan's feelings toward children - the troubled children she counsels, the baby she lost to leukemia - without ever shedding the image that it's just a machine. (This has the strange effect of both humanizing and darkening Proteus - until he starts wooing Mrs. Harris, Proteus represents the ultimate intellect shackled by the limits of an electronic universe, but not by morality. Decoding Susan's sensitivity to children, the machine becomes conscious of human pain, and more inhumanly capable of inflicting it).
""Demon Seed"" is light on science and heavy on visuals. (Director Donald Cammell was brought in after the script was ready - he vowed to preserve the story though monopolized the way it looked). Not a lot of the flick makes sense (the Harris home comes with a nifty basement that oozes hi-tech gadgetry just waiting for Proteus's utilization; but you've got to wonder what kind of guy keeps EEG, laproscopic equipment and a portable laser around; Proteus can synthesize spermatozoa, but can't reproduce a womb; though starting with the wheelchair-robot, Proteus magically conjures up a more sophisticated automaton, a gigantic version of one of those Rubik's Snake Puzzles of the 1980's), but the script makes good use of the tight space of the Harris home in which Proteus has made itself King. The script turns almost all of its humans into sterile robots little more human than Proteus, a misanthropic slant that's clearly intended.  In a more telling early scene, when Proteus is being educated on world history, the instructor clues him into the story of the Chinese Emperor who purged his realm of any historical record predating him by burning books. The biggest mistake may be Robert Vaughan as the voice of Proteus - not that it's miscasting, but the script can't make up its mind about whether Proteus is supposed to sound childlike innocent or a coldly calculating monster. Lacking a face, it's the voice that Proteus relies on for identity. (Perusing the Koonts novel, Proteus sounds closer to HAL-9000.) The biggest miscalculation was timing - all the American studios thought that 1977 was going to be the year audiences went back to sci-fi in a big way, but few if any appreciated how movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters"" and not ""high-minded 2001"" clones like ""Demon Seed"" would set the pace. The internet revolution that's put computers in so many American homes only dates this movie rather than substantiates its vision (today, Proteus would have nothing more to wield against Susan than Internet Spam). I'm surprised this movie ever made it to TV - the concept alone made it one of those flicks that you just know won't be turning up on TBS any time soon.",1033344000,7,4334,5.0700280112044815
388030,4,630196604X,"Very good screen adaptation of Dean Koontz's early paperback original sci-fi thriller.
Government think-tank scientist Fritz Weaver is the mastermind behind the creation of the first genuine artificial intelligence, Proteus IV.  Proteus is so intelligent, he refuses to comply with assignments to strip-mine Earth's oceans, since that would create an environmental instability ultimately threatening to man.  Seeking an answer to the riddle of man's ""isometric body and his glass-jaw mind,"" Proteus decides to conduct a clandestine experiment of his own on the human species.  Proteus' lab subject is Weaver's wife, Julie Christie.  His ultimate aim:  to synthetically create life in Christie's womb, and see it through to term...whether she cooperates, or not.
This is a great flick, suffering only from a rather bland 1970s look and the decidedly unappealing subjects of abduction and rape.  Christie largely performs a one-woman show as the subject of Proteus' unwanted attentions, though the other performers are equally good.  Gerrit Graham does a nice minor support turn as Christie's unlucky would-be rescuer, and Robert Vaughn voices Proteus with chilling detachment.  The effects are generally pretty good, though the computer-generated stuff is terribly primitive by today's standards.
Despite the unpleasantness of its subject matter, Demon Seed turns out to be a fascinating and strangely uplifting film by the time it's over.  It's very suspenseful, and holds your attention throughout.  It's also refreshingly adult.

7817928,5,630196604X,"I saw this movie 40 years ago (age 17) and I don't think I was old enough to get it back then, plus my memory of it has faded over time.  Then a few days ago the movie title popped into my head.  I read the reviews of others and decided to order it.  I'm glad I did.  I can echo other reviewers that it's a well made, well acted movie (by the main characters, anyway).  Putting the era it was made aside, this movie would hold up to what's expected today from the horror/thriller genre.  See it any way you can.",1506988800,,511,3.9607843137254903
