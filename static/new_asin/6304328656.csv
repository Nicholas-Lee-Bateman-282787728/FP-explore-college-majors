7870224,5,6304328656,"Talk about a treat for all of us who remember the good 'ol days of Nickelodeon - that would be the US run kid's TV station.  Before the Rugrats.  Before 'Teen Nick' (I have yet to figure out the point or purpose of that program).  Before all those came the good stuff.  Eureeka's Castle, Maya the Bee, David the Gnome, which since about 1995 have disappeared from existence.  Eureeka's castle features Jim Henson-quailty puppetry, fluffy plotlines, and a wonderfully clumsy dragon.  This is a great tape for folks of all ages.",1061683200,23,526,4.725274725274725
