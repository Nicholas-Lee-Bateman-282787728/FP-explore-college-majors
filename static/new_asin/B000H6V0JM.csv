8137249,5,B000H6V0JM,"Like other Gaither DVDs the songs of Back home in Indiana linger in one's memory, and their message is not lost over time. It is shear delight to hear and see really quality harmony linked to clear presentation of Gospel truth.  I love hearing younger folk enthusiastically sharing Life in a way that appeals to, and blesses, an old man like me - just on 80 years old.",1351123200,,368,4.411764705882353
