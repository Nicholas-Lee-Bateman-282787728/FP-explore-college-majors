8691002,5,B00QB51RH8,"Susan fails at a career in New York City and decides to return home. She doesnt have enough money for train fare, so she impersonates an 11-year-old in order to purchase a half-fare ticket. Fleeing the conductors on the train, who suspect her deception, she ducks into Major Kirbys state room. He feels compassion for this little girl, and takes her under his wing. Complications multiply. Ginger Rogers is exceptional in this breezy comedy, and Ray Milland is appropriately gallant. They play off each other well. The only negatives are that some viewers may not buy into a 31-year-old actress playing an 11/12-year-old little girl or the fact that Major Kirby sets little Sue Sue up on dates with high school boys at his military school. Other than that, this is an incredibly engaging comedy with the versatile Ginger Rogers delivering a stellar performance. This is a film one can sit back and thoroughly enjoy. I have to rate this chucklefest must see viewing.",1499299200,,965,4.890243902439025
