7918835,4,B00003ETRJ,"Some insipid stars (no examples, there is not enough space) have published autobiographies at 17, while other stars have to wait until Menopause to be truly heard. And since I mentioned Menopause you might like to know that  other words, such as Memphis, Sex, Elvis, Bogdanovich, Moonlighting, and  Singing are also very important to Cybill. This documentary features some  of the most exquisite pictures of the (still!) Memphis Belle, accompanied  by uncut Cybill stories. And one might find that most delightful since this  star seldom lacks good taste. For fans, a must-have; for the others - a  very actual tirade about how far one can get based on looks and about the  ever superficial City of Angels.",950054400,3,706,4.982905982905983
