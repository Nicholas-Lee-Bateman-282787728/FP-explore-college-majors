3176773,4,B00180OU8E,"There are two types of movie fans. The first is the fan who goes to the movies at least once a month, enjoys the film and perhaps has a favorite actor or director. Then there are the die hard film fans. The type of fan who must have every movie in a series, bad or not. The type of fan who sees almost any and everything out. The type of fan who watches something like horror films whether they're bad ones or not. Unfortunately, I am in the second group.

And with that in mind, I just sat down to watch a movie made for fans, about fans and more importantly about the film makers who make movies for those fans. The movie is BRUTAL MASSACRE and it is hilarious. Perhaps not to everyone but to film fans, definitely.

The story revolves around a low budget horror director named Harry Penderecki (David Naughton), a director noted for his terrible horror films. His credits include films like BOWEL MOVEMENT, THE READING DEAD, PEOPLE PESTICIDE and the infamous I'LL TAKE THE RING BACK...AND THE FINGER TOO. Yes, Harry was a one hit wonder who somehow has managed to continue working. And we are now privy to a behind the scenes look at his latest feature being made, BRUTAL MASSACRE.

The film has problems from day one as Harry travels to different potential investors trying to get money just to make the movie. The end result is a wealthy cowboy who feels that the biggest thing needed to make a successful horror film is breasts. With no one else to turn to, Harry accepts his terms and the production begins.

Troubles never cease to end on Harry's films. As the documentary of the film continues, we learn about the different deaths on the sets of Harry's previous efforts. We also become acquainted with the rest of the cast and crew in various interviews from loyal production coordinator Natalie (Ellen Sandweiss) to his stalwart assistant director Jason (Brian O'Halloran), the star of an ex-children's TV show.

Each day is fraught with new problems and each day we get to see more and more people affected by the film including the owner of the house they intend to shoot as the killer's house, Krenshaw (Gunnar Hansen). Props fail, cameras go out of focus, actors refuse to do nude scenes, actors quit with one day of shooting to go, kids from town drive by and ruin shots...all of this happens at one time or another and yet the film still gets made. Now if only someone will pick it up for distribution.

The film has been called, and rightfully so, the SPINAL TAP of horror films. Like that fake documentary, this film is a behind the scenes look at what goes on. There is little doubt that the problems found in this film have not happened at one time or another to a budding horror film director. And while we may find humor in it, chances are they didn't as it happened.

The cast is fantastic and filled with notable horror film icons. Naughton was the star of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON while Sandweiss was one of the female leads in the original EVIL DEAD. Hansen will forever be known as Leatherface from the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and Ken Foree as grip Carl has starred in both the original DAWN OF THE DEAD and recently in THE DEVIL'S REJECTS.  The pedigree for this film is tops.

The degree of acting found by these stars past and present is fantastic. The frustrations of Harry are believable as portrayed by Naughton. Sandweiss does great as a bitchy production head who tolerates no bull from anyone. O'Halloran (Dante in both CLERKS films) does a great job as the enthusiastic aide to Harry. And the rest of the cast? All do a fantastic job as well, playing their parts seriously straight which makes them even funnier.

The laughs in this film start big and taper off to more subtle ones. My favorite was a clip from Harry's film RETIREMENT HOME where a mad aide dresses as the Grim Reaper and hides in closets waiting to surprise elderly residents. This movie is a must for film fans. To tell all of the jokes would be to ruin it for you. If you love horror films or low budget flicks then by all means find this one. If not, well give it a chance anyway. As with a Penderecki film, the budget might be low but the laughs are not.",1217203200,7,4178,4.485526315789474
3176774,3,B00180OU8E,"Brutal Massacre is basically what you would get if Christopher Guest attempted to make a satiric look at the horror movie industry, only the chances are he would have much better success.  Despite it's flaws though, Brutal Massacre is better than the sum of it's parts, and delivers a fair amount of laughs regardless.  The film revolves around a documentary being shot around hack horror director Harry Penderecki (David Naughton of An American Werewolf in London) as he attempts to make a slasher flick that will put him back on top of the horror world.  Sadly, things don't go as planned, resulting in a series of backfires, accidents, mishaps, and hijinks.  Along for the ride are Penderecki's long suffering crew, which features Clerks' Brian O'Halloran and Evil Dead vet Ellen Sandweiss.  Horror vets Ken Foree (from the original Dawn of the Dead) and Gunnar ""Leatherface"" Hansen are here as well, and while there are some nice odes to the horror flicks of yesteryear, the film as a whole just doesn't take off the way it should.  It isn't nearly as funny or clever as it thinks it is, but for what it is, Brutal Massacre is worth a look at the very least for horror fans that don't mind having their tongue planted firmly in cheek.",1217030400,5,1238,4.708333333333333
3176775,1,B00180OU8E,"No way around it for me. Just a pathetic effort. Kind of embarrassing really. I've seen many movies with tiny budgets
that soar on the creativity of thier creators. Not brutal massacre. Its a fine line between so bad its good and just
so bad. Ed Wood is bad but good because he had a vision and he stuck to it. I sensed no underlying vision here so
it just looks bad, sounds bad and theres nothing going on behind the scenes that made me believe that the people who
produced this were anything more than a group of people who had an idea, raised a little money and made a cheap
boring little movie. Sorry guys but do yourselves a favor and keep your day job.",1255910400,,658,4.188976377952756
3176776,5,B00180OU8E,"David Naughton (AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON) as Harry Penderecki, Brian O'Halloran (CLERKS) as Jay, Gerry Bednob (THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN) as Hanu, Ken Foree (DAWN OF THE DEAD) as Carl, Ellen Sandweiss (THE EVIL DEAD) as Natalie, Vincent Butta as Bert Campbell and Gunnar Hansen (THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 1974) as Krenshaw stars in BRUTAL MASSACRE: A COMEDY. Also starring: Billy Lake as Shanksmith, Emily Brownell as Amy, M.J. Dibennedetti as Tanya, Bill Sorice as Oscar and Hiro Masuda as Honda. This movie has funny gags including funny moments like when Jay walks out of the basement & the spider is on his back and he screams. I also love the scene when the crew is trying to film BRUTAL MASSACRE but the shooting range is on the other side of the filming location and everyone runs in total panic. One last scene I love to death, it's in the deleted scenes though. Carl and Hanu fight each other when they have to share a hotel bedroom. Some funny quotes in the scene include when Hanu says; ""I'm gonna ""F"" with you now!"" Then Carl says; ""You're gonna ""F"" with me? What's wrong with you? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?! POLICE! POLICE! POLICE!"" These scenes are hysterical and this is the first movie I watched all the way through when I got it in the mail. In at least 3 years, this is the first movie I saw all the way through. I give this film a 5 out of 5 star rating!",1250726400,3,1375,4.417322834645669
3176777,4,B00180OU8E,"BRUTAL MASSACRE: A COMEDY is a mocumentary that lovingly pokes fun at the horror-film industry.  Low-budget horror director Harry Penderecki (David Naughton), whose last few films really tanked at the box office, is attempting a comeback with his latest effort BRUTAL MASSACRE.  Come along for an exclusive behind-the-scenes peek as documentarian Bert Campbell (Vincent Butta) follows the making of the Penderecki's new film from pre-production to opening night.

In addition to taking light-hearted jabs at the good and the bad of the low-budget horror-movie industry, this hilarious mockumentary also brings together a host of genre icons: David Naughton (1981's AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON); Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker (1981's THE EVIL DEAD); Gunnar Hansen (1974's original THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE); Ken Foree (1978's original DAWN OF THE DEAD and 2005's THE DEVIL'S REJECTS); and even famed genre writer, director, and producer Mick Garris (Showtime's MASTERS OF HORROR series).  To be sure, these genre insiders are here to attract die-hard horror fans, but they are also knowledgeable enough to tickle the genre in all the right places and elicit some great laughs.  Naughton is especially delightful as Harry Penderecki, an Ed Wood-like director who seems totally unaware of just how egregious his films really are.

The only fault with BRUTAL MASSACRE: A COMEDY is that there is no actual horror.  Being a hard-core horror fan myself, I kept expecting (and hoping!) that a ""real"" killer would pop up at any moment to add to the numerous setbacks that plague Penderecki and his film crew. But alas, no such horror occurs.  For that reason, I think that 2006's mockumentary BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON, in which a group of aspiring filmmakers ""document"" the career of a serial killer, is a more successful and satisfying parody of the horror genre. Still, in spite of its minor flaws, BRUTAL MASSACRE: A COMEDY is a funny, wholly enjoyable film.

Anchor Bay's DVD edition of BRUTAL MASSACRE: A COMEDY presents the film in anamorphic widescreen at its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  The picture quality is crisp and clear, and the clarity of the soundtrack is exceptional.  Bonus features on the disc include some hilarious extended and deleted scenes, as well as a mock featurette about the making of the ""documentary"" in which cast members are ""interviewed"" in character.  All in all, this DVD is a must-have for hard-core fans of horror cinema...well, for those with a good sense of humor, at least.",1227139200,3,2538,5.133495145631068
3176778,4,B00180OU8E,"This is a spectacularly bad film which poorly ""documents"" (it's a mockumentary) people who make spectacularly bad films ... talk about postmodern! And, for all that, I found Brutal Massacre surprisingly amusing.

Now, it must be noted that I REALLY dig epically terrible B-horror and have had the (dis)pleasure of being involved in some (amateur, bad, bad, bad) film-making myself, so this work appeals to me on both those levels. In this sense, it's a pretty niche film. If you've never seen a Troma movie ... or have never had to make your own fake-blood for a shoot that very day, you might want to steer clear of this work! Its humor could be lost on you (and you might try looking for a refund ... or a bar-fight). And, it's equally as crucial to note that this is a gore-free film without a single speck of suspense. So, gore-hounds should keep this in mind. This work is more about the RIDICULOUS trials of making a film on a shoe-string budget (the special-effects guy is ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL) and the insane demands of (Texan) backers.

Now for the much anticipated accolades: I loved the faux film-posters almost as much as I loved their titles: ""I'll Take the Ring ... And the Finger Too,"" ""People Pesticide,"" and the much ballyhooed ""The Reading Dead."" Why do I feel like I've actually rented these? (Or watched them back in the ""Up All Night with Rhonda Sheer/Gilbert Gottfried"" days. Ahhhh, childhood memories!!) Likewise, I thought the acting was pretty spot-on (meaning overly serious/borderline absurd). And, exactly how much of his soul did Stevan Mena sell to get this cast??!

Kudos to casting!! It made it all the more funny to spot familiar faces!

If you are a purveyor of out-of-focus nudity, if you are a fan of fancy gold briefs for men, or if you simply always wondered ""which finger means 'good,'"" well, this is the film for you, buddy! This is a ""bad"" film ... be prepared to enjoy it as such and you won't be disappointed!!",1226188800,3,2909,6.3224181360201515

Unfortunately, I found this recent effort lame, not funny at all and fairly boring. There are 1 or 2 mildly amusing scenes but no real laughs. I think Stevan should stick to horror...",1225584000,2,281,4.423076923076923
3176780,4,B00180OU8E,"Stevan Mena's (Malevolence) ""Brutal Massacre: A Comedy"" is a definite must for any lover of horror.

The premise of the film is that of a mockumentary. It chronicles the production all the way from the announcement of the film (Brutal Massacre) to the aftermath of the film. The insight is great and always humorous and light-hearted as well.

The acting and cameos are some of the best parts of the movie. Harry Penderecki, the man in the center (AKA Writer/Director of Brutal Massacre), is played by David Naughton of ""An American Werewolf in London"" fame. Great cameos by Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead), Ellen Sandweiss (The Evil Dead), Gunnar Hansen (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Gerry Bedknob (The 40 Year-Old Virgin) and Brian O'Halloran (Clerks, Clerks II) ensue and are sure to bestow upon you some hearty belly-laughs.

All in all, the film achieves what it sets out to... entertain the horror audience. Being a huge horror film fan I really appreciated this and I hope more people check this out. You won't be disappointed.

David is simply wonderful and even a bit charming as filmmaker Harry Penderecki. I found Brutal Massacre to be very quirky and clever and it actually had me laughing out loud several times. If you are in the mood for something a little different, light hearted, and comical... Brutal Massacre just may be your cup of tea.

Nothing works! Everything falls flat! The gags are not funny. The tip-off should be, on the cover it says 'A Comedy,' and any time a movie has to tell you it's a comedy on the cover, you  gotta know you're looking at a turkey. If you're a true horror fan and must watch it, rent, don't buy.

Now for the much anticipated accolades: I loved the faux film-posters almost as much as I loved their titles: ""I'll Take the Ring ... And the Finger Too,"" ""People Pesticide,"" and the much ballyhooed ""The Reading Dead."" Why do I feel like I've actually rented these? (Or watched them back in the ""Up All Night with Rhonda Sheer/Gilbert Gottfried"" days. Ahhhh, childhood memories!!) Likewise, I thought the acting was pretty spot-on (meaning overly serious/borderline absurd). And, exactly how much of his soul did Stevan Mena sell to get this cast??!

Kudos to casting!! It made it all the more funny to spot familiar faces!

If you are a purveyor of out-of-focus nudity, if you are a fan of fancy gold briefs for men, or if you simply always wondered ""which finger means 'good,'"" well, this is the film for you, buddy! This is a ""bad"" film ... be prepared to enjoy it as such and you won't be disappointed!!",1226188800,3,2909,6.3224181360201515

3411277,4,B00180OU8E,"Stevan Mena's (Malevolence) ""Brutal Massacre: A Comedy"" is a definite must for any lover of horror.

The premise of the film is that of a mockumentary. It chronicles the production all the way from the announcement of the film (Brutal Massacre) to the aftermath of the film. The insight is great and always humorous and light-hearted as well.

The acting and cameos are some of the best parts of the movie. Harry Penderecki, the man in the center (AKA Writer/Director of Brutal Massacre), is played by David Naughton of ""An American Werewolf in London"" fame. Great cameos by Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead), Ellen Sandweiss (The Evil Dead), Gunnar Hansen (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Gerry Bedknob (The 40 Year-Old Virgin) and Brian O'Halloran (Clerks, Clerks II) ensue and are sure to bestow upon you some hearty belly-laughs.

All in all, the film achieves what it sets out to... entertain the horror audience. Being a huge horror film fan I really appreciated this and I hope more people check this out. You won't be disappointed.

David is simply wonderful and even a bit charming as filmmaker Harry Penderecki. I found Brutal Massacre to be very quirky and clever and it actually had me laughing out loud several times. If you are in the mood for something a little different, light hearted, and comical... Brutal Massacre just may be your cup of tea. And if you are a fan of horror, this one is a no-brainer... just get it! This may very well be one of the best genre casts assembled in the past decade.

3411280,1,B00180OU8E,"This is supposed to be a mock documentary, in the tradition of This Is Spinal Tap, or, And God Spoke (The Making Of), but the only thing amusing about it is how far short it falls of those other excellent efforts, and you'd be better off rewatching one of them instead of seeing this gobbler. Nothing works! Everything falls flat! The gags are not funny. The tip-off should be, on the cover it says 'A Comedy,' and any time a movie has to tell you it's a comedy on the cover, you  gotta know you're looking at a turkey. If you're a true horror fan and must watch it, rent, don't buy. The only reason I'd give it even one star is that it's nice to see Ellen Sandweiss working again, and if they'd also brought her tree over from The Evil Dead, I might have given it two stars.",1218412800,,775,4.166666666666667

I hardly ever laugh out loud during a film, but this one had me in tears and hardly able to breathe I was laughing so hard. Highly recommended!",1218153600,2,426,4.545454545454546
8268243,2,B00180OU8E,"I don't know what reviewers giving this 4 and 5 stars are smoking, but it must be some pretty strong stuff to find laughs and enjoyment in this thing.

What hooked me on seeing it was the quote on the cover that says ""The Spinal Tap of Horror movies"", sure I loved Spinal Tap, this should be great then right? Wrong! This film had more budget spent on the design of the DVD cover than what went into the movie. It follows a fictional director around who was once a hit horror maker, but his last few movies have bombed and now a camera crew and interviewer are tagging along on the next do or die film project. It looks shot on VHS, the characters are pretty poor, the humor is not for me, or anyone I can imagine who likes a guy staring at someone then karate chopping them down and walking off casually... funny, yeah? Yeah, thats about as funny as this gets.

The biggest name in the movie is the guy who played Leatherface in the original TCM in 1974. Boy, looking at his iMDB credits, he sure went on to do big things. Everyone else is a kind of ""I might have seen them in something before, buggered if I know what"" or ""Oh, look, a bargain basement no frills cheap version of so-and-so""

Tho it can be watched from start to finish, barley, it contains no laughs, no memorable scenes, not much thought put into what they where trying to achieve and a a predictable plot acted by B-grade actors... maybe make that C-grade.",1508112000,,1425,4.289962825278811
8268244,2,B00180OU8E,"This mockumentary did not live up to any of its potential. The humor is only slightly present. The attempted suicides did not match well with the mood of the film. The film also had gratuitous moments of brief nudity that clashed with the tone. David Naughton having a mustache is just wrong. Gunnar Hansen was funny in the movie and reminded me of my neighbor and the pants crapping story was also funny. The part where Naughton chases the effects guy is crazy and the decision concerning the ending of the movie they was filming was a nice touch as well as the people driving by ruining the shots.

A COMEDY

I am a big fan of mockumentaries with my favorite probably being Fear of a Black Hat off of the top of my head. So when I found out about this one I had to get it. It is a mockumentary about the making of a horror film and also has Brian OHalloran of Clerks fame in it. It is the perfect mixture of many things I like so I knew I had to have it. When I was finally able to get a DVD copy years ago my brother and I popped it in and watched.

Harry Penderecki [David Naughton] is a horror film icon {on the B level that is} with films like Ill Take the Ring BackAnd the Finger Too, People Pesticide among many others. He is ready to make his comeback and thinks he has just the film to do it, Brutal Massacre. This film is a straight forward slasher flick with everything you would want, naked women, blood, guts and everything in between. Of course like any low budget horror flick the problems on set may be a little scarier than the actual film.

This movie is hilarious and everyone in it plays their parts perfectly. Now like I said I came for Dante, I mean Brian, but I ended up loving everyone. Of course he is excellent here as the AD for the film, but everyone is great. Still I think the MVP actually is Naughton as the filmmaker trying to score one more hit. This dude was hilarious and was perfect for the part. Of course writer/director Stevan Mena did a great job here. His movie is very funny and made me a bigger fan of his. His previous film Malevolence was an excellent indie horror film as was its follow up Bereavement [which I think was one of my best reviews]. I cant wait for Killer: Malevolence 3.

The special features for this DVD are trailers, deleted scenes and the hilarious Making Of feature. Like the film it is a mockumentary style feature, everyone still in character about the making of the behind the scenes that you just watched about making a horror movie. It is excellent and highly recommended. I do think this is one of the funniest mockumentary films I own. I wish we could have gotten a commentary with everyone still in character like the behind the scenes.",1428969600,,2125,4.265508684863524

8268250,1,B00180OU8E,I was really willing to cut this movie some slack as it was clear it was low budget and a comedy but it pushes you too far.  There is a lot of dead air in the film which makes its length seem undeserved.  Its kinda of shot similar to the Office but not nearly as well.  The mockumentary style is played out. Most of the acting is just screaming.  The rest is just cheesy.  I felt so bad for Brian O'Halloran. Avoid this one at all costs.,1369612800,,437,3.9770114942528734
8268251,3,B00180OU8E,"BRUTAL MASSACRE is Stevan Mena's ode to the Horror genre, its filmmakers, and its fans. Coming off of the underground success of his Slasher hit MALEVOLENCE, Mena decided to move on to Comedy, using the ""Mockumentary"" shooting style made popular in The Office to deliver his story. This film-within-a-film finds Horror director Harry Penderecki on the shoot of his comeback picture, BRUTAL MASSACRE, where anything that can go wrong, does go wrong. With no money, less talent, and limited time, this rag-tag team of filmmakers must come together to finish the project and save their careers! BRUTAL MASSACRE boasts an impressive line-up of familiar genre faces and an incredibly witty script that falls just short of genius. David Naughton (AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON) leads as the inspired but utterly helpless Harry Penderecki, and is joined by Ellen Sandweiss and Besty Baker (THE EVIL DEAD), Gunnar Hansen (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), Ken Foree (DAWN OF THE DEAD), and many others. Mena uses the  light tone to make clever strikes at the film industry, commenting on many of the toughest issues facing filmmakers that are forced to compromise their integrity and vision in order to earn financial backing. At the same time, he also pokes fun at directors' overwhelming sense of self-importance and pretentious attitudes towards their films, which is best shown when Harry is found deflecting accusations of misogyny and gratuitous violence with meaningless psychobabble. Though the writing is very smart, the timing and dry deliveries often undermine the humor, but genre fans will enjoy seeing their idols in sillier performances. While it may not be perfect, BRUTAL MASSACRE is an entertaining reflection on the genre that is sure to appeal to the Horror audiences that it was intended for.
