8555469,2,B00AOO5QX8,"For a college project Jack (Courtney Gains) plans on recording human screams and combine them into ""music, sex, and pain"" the theme for his college professor (Jim O'Donoghue). Jack wants to record live screams and travels around with a police scanner. Later Jack finds his way into the seedy underground of torture to collect his screams.

I would say that unless you are really into the S&M scene, this film is not for you. The production lacks the graphics of slasher gore, but still contains blood and killings. We wait and see how far Jack will go, only to be disappointed by the lack luster performances the lame scenes, and bad accent of Professor Laffit.
