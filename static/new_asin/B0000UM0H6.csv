8003096,5,B0000UM0H6,"The show ran from 1982-2003 & told the story of the lives of the residents in Liverpool, England.  The series was often topical with some of its themes centering on incest, rape, drug addiction & lesbianism to name but a few.  Sadly, Brookside is highly underrated, but was a decent soap with viable & dramatic storylines & it is a shame there is no american DVD release of Brookside in any installment.  It was finally done with Coronation Street, so dare we hope to see a U.S. offering of Brookie?  Unfinished Business, is, I believe, the uncut very last installment of this show after its final episode was broadcast on UK's channel 4 (Brookside's former home).  This is said to have tied up some of the loose ends not done in the television finale. Alexandra Fletcher (Jacqui Dixon Farnham) & Sarah White (Bev) are two of my very favorite actresses from this program(me).

I highly recommend this to Liverpool lovers & to those who can appreciate UK drama in serial form.",1249689600,,975,4.6725146198830405
