7476654,5,B016NVSB6O,"Great nostalgia!  When Bo and John Derek were cashing in on her stardom which was won for being the perfect '10' in the movie of the same name, he put her in these borderline erotic cinematographer's fantasy epics (spurred no doubt by the success of Tarzan the Ape Man) which really have ridiculous plots that are easy on the brain and then proceed to give you an hour and a half or so of eye candy a la Mrs. Derek and various male counterparts.  Soft porn major Hollywood studio style.  They're a hoot (especially poor George Kennedy).  They even got Anthony Quinn to make one with them!!!  I remember them fondly and it's good to see them on blu-ray.  Really the Cinematographer's are the unsung heroes of these films.
The best of their kind ever done (sorry Emmanuel).",1455667200,11,771,4.550724637681159

Actually the younger chick in Bolero is the reason you wanna watch the movie trust me....unbelievable, almost unfathomable body on her.

8736883,3,B016NVSB6O,"So...you pretty much know what to expect with Bo Derek. ""Bolero"" is notorious and thought of as one of the most gratuitous films of all time, between the raunchy Derek sex scenes and early appearance of Olivia D'Abo. ""Ghosts Do It,"" despite the zero-dollar SFX budget, actually is a watchable picture which also showcases Derek's flesh frequently and pointlessly.

I found it impossible to make it all the way through even one of them, much less both. I will say though that the scenery in ""Ghosts Can't Do It"" is wonderful (and no, I'm not talking about Derek's nude body) and she does a far better job of acting in that role than anyone ever will give her credit for. ""Bolero,"" despite brushing so closely to feature-length hard-core porn, still somehow manages to be boring.

Concerning the Blu-ray release, I can't tell that this is anything other than just a standard DVD in Blu-ray clothing. Doesn't seem to be of particularly high picture quality and has basically none of the typical functionality of a Blu-ray.",1461888000,12,1019,4.817142857142857
