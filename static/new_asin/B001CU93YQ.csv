8326317,3,B001CU93YQ,"The treatment of the Boxer Rebellion is reasonably well handled, but entirely from an American point of view and U.S. involvement. The important contributions of the British, German, French and especially Japanese, in the defence of the Legation Quarter of Peking is largely unacknowledged. Sir Claude MacDonald, the British ambassador and generally recognised ""leader"" of the resistance, does not even rate a mention. The fact that troops from British India were the first of the relief force to enter the beleaguered Legation Quarter some two hours before the U.S. soldiers is perhaps understandably not recorded. (The British arrival ahead of other contingents anyway owed more to luck than to fighting or strategy.) The harrowing siege of Bishop Favier and missionaries and Chinese Christians in the Peitang (North Cathedral), defended by only a small detachment of French and Italian sailors, is completely omitted. Within the limitations of an exclusively American viewpoint the film is a fair general coverage, so long as one does not regard it as the whole picture by any means.",1375401600,,1086,5.319767441860465
8326318,4,B001CU93YQ,"Despite a slight favoring of the Chinese position, this video presents a mostly balanced presentation of the key events leading up to, during, and after the Boxer Rebellion in China.  The video uses a combination of eye witness video, photographs, and journals to support the narrative.  I show it to my 10th grade classes because it is highly informative video that serves as a good introduction to the subject.",1265673600,8,412,4.956521739130435
