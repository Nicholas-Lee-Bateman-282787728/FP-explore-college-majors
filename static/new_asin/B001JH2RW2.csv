8312874,5,B001JH2RW2,"The delivery was fast and everything was in place. The entire series of 6 DVD fits in a 1.5 DVD size box. Very good for the environment.
The series itself is awesome, better than I remembered it. It teaches you a lot about how to start a life from the scratch. Very good for the kids that think that the chicken comes from the supermarket! My family is loving it.
The video quality is very good. Has no other language than ""Mexican"" Spanish (quite different from European Spanish but ok). My kids are learning Spanish as they have fun. No subtitles. The sound quality could be better. But the series is totally worthy.

Knowing what I know, I would buy it again.",1310601600,2,662,4.426229508196721
