7470963,4,B016EQRH90,"This was a pretty weird low budget one. Definitely worth checking out on Amazon Prime if you like low budget horror flicks. My only complaint, it ended too soon.",1463011200,,161,4.586206896551724

7470973,1,B016EQRH90,"The worst kind of no-budget tripe. Not ""good-bad"", just ""bad-bad"" - and I love B-Horror movies.",1464566400,,95,5.0
7470974,1,B016EQRH90,"LOW BUDJET, PATHETIC THAT I AM PAYING FOR GARBAGE LIKE THIS, PLUS YOU LIED SAYING IT IS A 2016 FILM,NO WAY, MORE LIKE 80S LOW BUDJET.CRAP DONT WASTE YOUR TIME",1464393600,,158,4.3
7470975,1,B016EQRH90,Except for seeing Beverly Lynn's breasts. It is a complete waste of time.,1464307200,,73,4.6923076923076925
7470976,1,B016EQRH90,"Felt like my Grandmother was filming the movie while breast feeding her 21 year old stepson and husband of 65.  Movie ha e me ""Blue Balls & Goute "" at same time.  Would rather watch ""Attack of killer Tomatoes""!  Advice to those wanting a good movie: watch you TV screen blank for two hours and get a better result/movie!  No Ship! ""T"" included !!!",1464307200,,347,4.375
7470977,1,B016EQRH90,"There's a reason this was a 'lost' work. No plot. Just random people getting whacked, and maybe 200 words of dialog... but lot's of grunting by the antagonist. Ugh!",1464307200,,164,4.689655172413793
7470978,1,B016EQRH90,"Spooky?  Very spooky to even think anyone ever thought this was going to be worth the time and effort to make.  Clearly the guy playing Hellbilly is wearing a mask and the filming looks like something someone who just found a camera and started filming stuff would have done, they probably would have done a better job.  Do not let the cover art fool you, it is totally misleading.  Only thing even nice about this is that it is so short, don't think I could have stood another second.  Blah!",1464220800,,492,4.4222222222222225
7470979,1,B016EQRH90,REALLY????!!!,1464134400,,13,13.0
7470980,1,B016EQRH90,"Low production quality is fine, but the 5 minute intro with 30 second looped soundtrack while someone shakily holds a camera behind a dirty windshield while we watch a boring countryside drive is all the indication you need. Then it's right to the sex and sudden murder. In broad daylight.",1463961600,,289,4.8
7470981,1,B016EQRH90,"All I can say is that the director and the actors should be forced to sit down and watch their own movie. Still, that would not be punishment enough.",1463875200,,149,4.172413793103448
7470982,1,B016EQRH90,"This is not a movie, it is further proof Amazon will show anything...please stop. Nothing more than an extremely BAD FILM and not in a good way, barely worth wasting time to review...do not check it out!",1463702400,3,203,4.513513513513513
7470983,1,B016EQRH90,"Cannot begin to express how much of a waste of time this film is, it should have been buried.",1463616000,2,93,3.9473684210526314

7470985,1,B016EQRH90,"Super Stupid - unwatchable. The imp who was ""Hell Billy"" should be banned from movies along with the others. Yuk",1463529600,2,112,4.65
7470986,5,B016EQRH90,It was exactly what I was looking forward to seeing. Great job to everyone involved. Keep em coming,1463529600,,99,4.555555555555555
7470987,5,B016EQRH90,"the spooky level of this movie is through the roof. pair that with dynamic character development, thought-provoking insight into the human psyche and a flawless storyline -- and you've got a legendary film. 11/10 bags of popcorn and a dry martini -- because after watching this gem you're definitely going to feel v sophisticated ",1463443200,,330,5.111111111111111

7470990,5,B016EQRH90,An awesome throwback to the slasher films of old. I've worked with Max and he always comes up with great ideas.,1463184000,2,111,4.333333333333333

7470993,5,B016EQRH90,Great movie and a classic from Massimiliano.  His work just keeps getting better and creepier.  Check out all of his movies too!,1463097600,2,128,4.7727272727272725
8736396,5,B016EQRH90,"This movie is hilarious. I've never seen a no-budget joke of a horror movie so hysterically bad. Everything from the acting to the joke of a 'villain', who is stupid enough to hit a chessboard on purpose instead of the two innocent men playing it. Yeah, that happens in this VHS-recorded movie that is unsurprisingly not from 2016 (as the date says on the screen), but from 2003, the same year Tommy Wiseau's disaster masterpiece 'The Room' was released. Even Tommy was able to make his movie look at least 'authentic'. YEAH, 'Hillbilly' is THAT BAD IT'S GOOD. I hope for a cult following to come across this, and I recommend this for ANY bad movie night.",1505001600,,655,4.6068376068376065
8736397,1,B016EQRH90,don't waste your money onthis 30 minute long movie total trash threw it in the dumpster,1501027200,,87,4.5

8736399,1,B016EQRH90,This is an awful homemade horror movie. It makes student films look like masterpieces by comparison. Avoid!,1497052800,,107,5.352941176470588

8736401,5,B016EQRH90,FANTASTIC MOVIE ! I enjoyed it ! Gritty and shot on the point of view of the killer !!,1476316800,,86,3.5789473684210527
8736402,1,B016EQRH90,sad storyline of a b---. poorly acted.,1474243200,,38,4.571428571428571
8736403,1,B016EQRH90,"Hellbilly (Clayton Bigsby) wears a mask, grunts, lives in an abandoned trailer, and kills people, mostly with a machete. There is no character introduction. The only way we could tell he was an incest baby was from the banjo music. Idiotic throughout. Certainly laughable under the right conditions.

8736404,1,B016EQRH90,"I never post reviews, but after about 23 minutes into this movie, decided it was time. I never take the advice of the reviews. When they say ""this movie sucks"", I still watch. But this movie...is just..pathetic. I think it was recorded on a cell phone, or a baked potato. The ""warning"" they give you at the begining is for ""violence"" or something like that. It should be a warning for how stupid this movie is. What an embarassment. How could someone make this movie, watch the finished product, and think anything other then ""I should just delete this""? I gave it one star, because a sad face wasn't an option.",1469145600,2,611,4.513513513513513
