8016732,4,B0001VSO6A,"I got this at my library. This dvd has great production value, great, to the point acting so you won't get bored. The basics are easy, whatever you would do for a human, do for a dog overall. Yes, even CPR. Some things like poison, you can call the Animal Poison Control Center number or for snake bites, they tell you not to do anything or suck it out, but to go to a vet which is obvious.
Topics include:
First aid kit, What is normal, Scene safety, muzzle, A-B-C (CPR lingo), Rescue breathing, CPR, choking, drowning, mechanism of an injury, spinal injury, fractures, wounds, evisceration, gunshot wounds, penetrating chest wounds, embedded objects, shock, car accidents, poisoning, snake bites, hypothermia, burns, chemical burns, heat stroke, electric shock,  eye injuries, foot injuries, ear problems
They use real dogs to demonstrate, for CPR, they used s stuffed one. All these topics will also show you the signs & symptoms, not just what to do.",1199404800,7,954,4.888888888888889
