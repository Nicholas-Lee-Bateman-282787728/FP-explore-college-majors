8131657,3,B000GG4XUQ,"These DVD releases are from the original run of ""Elvira's Movie Macabre"" that also produced the memorable big box Thriller Video tapes back in the late 80's. The video and sound quality of the movies and Elvira segments are pretty bad; they were obviously taken from dodgy VHS sources. The other drawback is that these versions are usually censored since they're direct ports from what you saw on television.

In this double feature (...not as good as Elvira's), we get a lame horror-house feature called ""Legacy of Blood"" and a strange European oddity called ""The Devil's Wedding Night"", which was shot by Italian schlock-master Joe D'Amato. Neither of the movies are great shakes, but I enjoyed DWN for its slow, somewhat effective atmosphere and period setting. ""Legacy..."" was awful and, even worse, boring. Elvira even had a tough time with this one, resorting to lots of eye-rolling, ear-gouging puns.

Because of the AV quality and the general off-beat quality of the films, I can't give this anything more than a very mild recommendation. But, for this Elvira fan, this was a great trip down memory lane.",1409356800,,1112,4.973118279569892
8131658,5,B000GG4XUQ,"Cool vampire movie with Sara Bay of ""Lady Frankenstein"" fame. Vampires with fangs, hot naked chicks, a fun story, what's not to like??? Cool monster movie, but the other movie on the disk isn't worth watching.",1369440000,,209,4.833333333333333
8131659,4,B000GG4XUQ,"I liked Elvira, than the movies.
Though, the second one was Scary.
Damon was good in his roles as twins.",1360540800,,104,4.25
8131660,5,B000GG4XUQ,A must have for anybody who was a fan of Elvira's Movie Macabre show. It's just like watching her show but without the commercials...Fantastic!!,1327622400,,144,5.041666666666667
8131661,3,B000GG4XUQ,"Elvira's legacy of blood was ok to watch not very likely to capture attention of any horror movie fans and as for The Devil's Wedding Night the copy of the movie is not that clear at all it seems that it was transfer from vhs and as for the movie was good but also seems that it was cut and not uncut version anyway the plot was good enough to enjoy the full movie,will give 3 stars",1229040000,5,382,3.9740259740259742
8131662,3,B000GG4XUQ,"Living on the east coast I did not see these when originally aired in the 80's & 90's.  I was expecting something along the lines of ""Mystery Science Theater"", where the hosts would make off-the-wall comments while the film was shown.

With these movies, Ms. Elvira makes comments at the intro and commercial break spots, which isn't bad but not what I was hoping for.  The print quality of the films is what you would expect for a late night, locally produced show complete with scratches in the film and pops and cracks in the audio. I must admit this brought back memories of my youth when I would stay up late and watch TV all night.",1159315200,14,637,4.427350427350428
