8701919,5,B00TIUAXPK,"This set of 20 half hour documentaries is a compilation for Blu-ray and DVD of an earlier series released on DVD around about 2007. The documentary content is identical to the earlier DVDs but differs in so far as each of the original DVDs included an accompanying recording of the complete work showcasing the same recording that had been used for the documentary examples. The new box set does not include any complete performances but concentrates solely on the documentary programs. This is not all loss by any means as described below.

The lack of the complete recording after each documentary in the new presentation may be criticised by some but is arguably a wise decision for two main reasons. Firstly, it allows the set to be compressed onto just 4 Blu-ray or 5 DVD discs at a much reduced and very reasonable price. Secondly, it leaves the purchaser free to choose a complementary recording or not as appropriate. There are now many fine alternative recordings on CD/SACD with an increasing number of fine and/or preferable video alternatives on DVD or Blu-ray which many collectors may prefer.

The format of the documentaries follows a consistent pattern. There is a short introductory section during which the historical and musical perspectives are outlined. Thereafter there is a more detailed description of the music as the chosen piece develops. This is delivered by a host presenter with a substantial accompanying narrative explanation which describes the points made. The musical examples are frequently accompanied with a score sub-title which allows those interested in following the musical notation as it progresses to do so.

The host presenters are varied and also have varied deliveries to camera / viewer. There are five particularly outstanding hosts whose excitement in the music being presented makes for compulsive viewing largely because they deliver with direct eye contact and with skilled illustrations via piano. These are Robert Levin (Bach & Haydn), Michael Beckerman (Dvorak), Jeremy Barham (Mahler 5), Peter Hill (Stravinsky) and Paul Roberts (Debussy & Ravel). To these can be added the contributing two solo violinists who illustrate main points directly on their instruments. They are Frank Erben (Mendelssohn) and Gil Shaham (Brahms). All of these speak in English.

The remaining presenters speak in German with voice-overs mostly but with sub-titles otherwise. A linking feature throughout nearly every single program is the contribution, off camera, of narrator Dulcie Smart who communicates an apparent enthusiasm in English both for her script and what it relates to. She radiates a pleasant manner and her contribution is a major share of the total non-musical playing time.

The discs are presented with six language options  English, German, French, Spanish, Korean and one other that may be Chinese. No doubt those who can read the language will recognise the choice!

The booklet enclosed with the box is particularly well written and should also be a source of easily assessed information. It is complementary to the documentaries and deals with the subject of each one without simply reproducing the script of the programs.

There is a fold-back timeline in the centre of the booklet which, unfortunately, has been stapled in back to front. This was an accidental publishing error by the printers and will affect the whole of this issue. However, it is very easy to remedy as follows: Open the booklet at the centre pages; open up the staple ends with a knife blade; remove ONLY the centre fold and replace the correct way round by putting the opened staple points through the staple holes in the centre fold. Use the knife blade once more to close down the staples. This took about three minutes to achieve for a perfect result and is hardly worth complaining about.

Nothing presented is in any way controversial and is very secure musically. This is a thoroughly interesting and useful guide delivered by a variety of ways that should have universal appeal to the target audience. It is assumed that the audience is one which has an enquiring mind as regards the material and which may use the understanding gained to further their interest by purchasing recordings of the illustrated music as a stepping-off point for further investigation.

Seven of the recordings are pre-HD vintage, mostly late 1990s, but the rest are HD recordings from 2000-2006. They have been taken from Euroarts back-catalogues and all feature reliable performances. Some have been taken from particularly fine concerts which would be worth buying individually. Top suggestions would be Brahms violin concerto coupled with Dvorak 9 etc. (Shaham / Abbado); Mahler 5 (Abbado at Lucerne) and Beethoven 5 and 9 (Abbado box of complete symphonies). Other options will be a matter of individual choice.

In summary this box offers an excellent introduction to key works at a reasonable cost while leaving the purchaser free to purchase the individual works in alternative formats and prices.",1436745600,12,5024,5.167281672816729
