7148430,4,B00WQT2R0Y,Amazing documentary of an amazing photographer. The only thing is that the blu-ray doesn't have portuguese (the language spoken by Salgado) or spanish. Just english.,1437436800,3,165,5.64
7148431,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"This movie is unlike any other I've ever seen. It is the story of Sebastiao Salgado, a man who was moved to document humanity and our impact on our planet and each other. The movie, at times, can lead one to despair. Indeed, I felt that I could never show the sort of fortitude and dedication that Salgado brings to his work. Without giving away anything more, I will say that I found the ending quite uplifting.

If you like photography, you will appreciate this move. If you care about the planet and the direction in which we humans are taking it, you may love this movie,",1437091200,15,575,4.373831775700935

7148435,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"Sebastiao Salgado only took up photography in his 30s and the discipline became an obsession. Every single picture that he has taken, offers so much depth and untold stories in every single pixel of that image that I can stare for hours and hours, year after year happily. It was so nice to watch this documentary. Wish him well. Amazing talent.",1435881600,15,345,4.672131147540983
7148436,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"""The Salt of the Earth"" is a wonderful documentary about an extraordinary photographer and amazing human being.  Wim Wenders co-directs this film about Sebastiao Salgado, a man who studied economics, but ended up traveling the world in search of the human condition through his art.  The film chronicles Salgado's projects to photograph the peoples of Central and South America, the genocides in Africa, the firefighters putting out Kuwaiti oil fires in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, the world's workers, the natural world, and more.  The film also documents the successful efforts of Salgado and his wife to replant the rainforests of their home in Brazil.

Wenders portrays Salgado as a real-life Indiana Jones adventurer.  The treasure Salgado finds, however, is the rich experience of humanity and the planet Earth.  The film never strays too strongly into politics, though it's easy to see what Salgado's views are on a myriad of topics.  Regardless of your own political standpoint, you can't help but be moved by the man's adventure, and, more importantly, his photographs.  ""The Salt of the Earth"" is simply a remarkable film that features Salgado's beautiful, haunting images throughout.",1435017600,46,1197,5.230366492146596
7148437,5,B00WQT2R0Y,The film is quiet and crashing. It is art and anthropology; politics and geography. It is  the beauty of human anatomy and the solace of reflection.,1433376000,8,148,4.6923076923076925
7148438,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"Ive long been a fan of documentary photography, ever since I purchased a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Family-Of-Man/dp/0870703412/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Family Of Man</a>&nbsp;a half century ago. Another age, when the great ones roamed the world. There were the few who worked for the Farm Security Administration, and documented the plight of farmers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. And there was W. Eugene Smith, badly wounded in World War II, with his picture of hope as his two children walked out of the tunnel of trees into the light. Most regrettably, I had never heard of Sebastiao Salgado until I saw this movie. He has  brilliantly  maintained the fine tradition of documentary photography, and perhaps even improved on it. This movie documents his life and work.

Salgado grew up in central Brazil, and is an economist by training, once going out to the countries he now provides images of, as a World Bank official. The documentary starts with a very large hole in the ground, in Brazil, where 50,000 men work every day, nary a machine in site, all in the pursuit of gold, climbing rickety ladders with their bags of dirt, one of which, all hope, will be pay dirt. Salgado climbs down into the hole to obtain those impressive pictures. Then there is a moving photograph of a blind Tuareg woman, that is reflective of his empathy for the all-too-many forgotten.

Brazil was under a dictatorship when Salgado commenced his career. He decided to flee in August 1969 and settled in Paris. Lelia would become his wife. Early on, they made the decision to abandon the safe career of work with the World Bank, and take up photography. He would travel the world, often to destinations untrampled by tourists, to document the lives of people who may have never even heard the term: celebrity culture. People who can be called the salt of the earth.

Salgado and his wife would select certain areas of the world as a project. The first area was the Sahel region of Africa. He went to Niger, in 1973 and photographed the devastation and deaths caused by the serious drought. A marabout predicted that his wife was pregnant. Their first child, Juliano, was born in Paris, 1974, and would, much later, help produce this film.

From 1977 to 1984 the project was the other Americas, profonde South America, as the French might say, where Liberation Theology, medieval living conditions, and the music all co-existed. He would return to Brazil when the military dictatorship ended and document the northeast region, which he called the Sahel of Brazil, since it was also suffering from drought. His parents were now old, and the family farm devastated. The solution: one of my all-time favorites, straight out of Jean Gionos&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Homme-Qui-Plantait-Des-Arbres-French-Edition/dp/207053880X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Homme Qui Plantait Des Arbres (French Edition)</a>).

He would return to Africa, 1984 to 86, again the drought, killing millions. He started in Ethiopia, and lived with the people of Tigray for two months, eventually accompanying them on their exodus to Sudan. They would be strafed by government helicopters along the way. Salgado denounced the central government for withholding food. He went on to Mali in 1985. There is absolutely no mention of his own health and logistics living under such conditions. His actions, and his telling photographs helped call attention to the plight of these peoples.

His next project was on the workers of the world, a five-year project from 1986 to 1991. The resultant work was translated into many languages. He went to Kuwait in 1991, and photographed the oil field fires, started with the compliments of the retreating Iraq Army. Back to Africa, and he was in Tanzania when the genocide/civil war broke in Rwanda. On the road to Kilgali, there were 150 km of dead bodies. He would go to Yugoslavia in 1995, and photograph that civil war. Back to Africa, the Congo, where 250,000 Rwandans were expelled from the town of Goma. Into the jungle, only 40,000 survived a long trek. They too would disappear, and only because Salgado was willing to get off the UN relief train, and stay with them, would any of this be known.

He would make other journeys to Papua New Guinea, to his native Brazil to photograph a lost tribe that place a wooden tube through their chins, and to an uninhabited Siberian island to photograph the walruses. His latest book, Genesis, is of the natural world, the half of the planet that remains, still not impacted by humans (a rather amazing percentage, if true). What is true is that Salgado is an amazing man, who, along with his wife, have roamed the globe, providing vital and brilliant images of areas and people that receive virtually no attention. His books are pricey, but a collection of them should be considered essential. As for this movie, and its insights into Salgado and his work, 6-stars.",1508284800,5,5036,5.13919413919414

7148447,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"This documentary about Brazilian photographer Sebastio Salgado explores his social projects Sahel, Africa and Migrations and concludes by studying his most recent and naturalistic project, Genesis.  I cannot think of a filmmaker better suited to this project than Wim Wenders because his larger than life approach to film-making meshes perfectly with Salgado's more real than real pictures.  The most important truth I learned from this movie is that humanity is just as capable of horrific destruction as it is of doing good, yet for some reason, we tend to choose the former more often than the latter.  This is my third perfect score for a Wenders movie.  He is that good.",1492732800,,675,5.054054054054054

The majority are born into these circumstances and will spend the rest of their lives working and living this way.  Sebastiao Salgado spent his life chronicling the lives of People - just ""ordinary"" People. It was this film which had he and his wife return to Brazil where they were born and where, together, they recreated the land in which he's been raised.

The movie is both thoughtful and thought provoking.  As a photographer, I am inspired to take on more personal projects and find passion in my work. As a human being, I am inspired to have a better understanding of my fellow man and my place and contribution on and to this earth.  This movie is phenomenal.",1468972800,,651,4.483050847457627

 The viewer will be swept, if not crushed, by waves of awe, beauty, devastation, sadness, hope and epiphany.
 After viewing the film, one is left with the profound sense of having the entirety of human existence, from the dawn of history to today, poured through their eyes and into their consciousness.
 ""The Salt of the Earth"" is epic and rewarding, a testament to the trials and tribulations of the most prolific and complicated species on Earth: us.
  Selgado excelled at capturing the scale of large events while never losing the intimacy of telling individual stories.

After I watched it, I felt I must buy this - to not only see it again (and again) but to share with others. One is just not the same after seeing it!  To go far from home, leave  one's nuclear family for years at a time, and stay some places ""as long as it took"" to become intimate with a place/its people, not to mention taking risks great and small, now that's not your everyday career!

The recurring genocide and ecological destruction that is evident in so many parts of the modern world cannot go unnoticed.

7148512,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"I saw one of Sebastio Salgado's shows in Berkeley back in 2002. I was an immediate fan. So since then I've tried to follow his work. I just recently bought his latest book about coffee. So I had to get this DVD. It shows us, the viewer why his images are so important to view, to dissect and understand. It's art to me but it also makes the viewer see how important human compassion truly is. It's like Salgado is half photographer and half humanitarian. His work moves anyone willing to give it the time it deserves. As I watched his life story unfold, I felt like I was seeing my dream life. I envy his work, his travels and how he has such a genuine care for all that he photographs. He's not just a humanitarian, he's a true conservationist. What you'll see in this video is a perfect mixture of those two. He's my favorite photographer. I just want to say, ""Obrigado Sebastio"".",1451260800,,882,4.351515151515152

Salgado's photos are stunning looks at people living in situations most of us will never experience. In so doing, he has shed new light on the human condition of the past three decades. This is also a story of an amazing, life-long partnership between Salgado and his wife. What they have done in resurrecting the rain forest of the Salgado family farm in Brazil is astounding and a model for environmental reclamation. Not to be missed.",1447545600,2,554,4.663265306122449
7148522,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"Sr. Salgado is undisputably one of the best photographers of our times; this movie/documentary tells the story of the incredible journey that is his life. Strong images keep the viewer intensely focused; some are shocking but, as he says, EVERYONE should see these pictures, they help us realize what the world is like outside our comfort zone. I am glad that he was able to survive all the horror he witnessed and managed to re-channel his efforts into doing something really positive. The last book he made, Genesis - result of over a decade of hard work - is, in my opinion, the BEST photography book ever published. Well worth seeing for anyone with an interest in photography, social events, travel, humanity. The obvious conclusion is that he managed to become not only a superb photographer, but also a wonderful human being.",1447113600,,832,4.866197183098592

The viewer will be swept, if not crushed, by waves of awe, beauty, devastation, sadness, hope and epiphany. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is utterly rewarding and complete in its scope. The sublime nature of the experience is ultimately due to the decades of hard work by its subject: Sebastiao Salgado. He has traveled the earth in search of people living, perhaps grinding, along life's edge. While doing so, he has created, using his immense talent and skill as a photographer along with an intense passion for the experiences of others, images that are technically precise and artfully rich in composition, lighting and detail. No matter the subject matter, his photographs are simply beautiful if not also sublime. After viewing one is left with the profound sense of having the entirety of human existence, from the dawn of history to today, poured through their eyes and into their consciousness.

But the project that the Salgado family took on after he left his documentary life made for a very refreshing and uplifting end that keeps this from being completely overwhelming.

7148596,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"From horrors to possible redemption.  Wonderful photography and plea for understanding and improvement.  Hell on earth, but the possibility of a brighter future.  Takes a strong stomach to see how bad things are around the world.",1438300800,4,229,5.305555555555555
7148597,5,B00WQT2R0Y,Beautiful beyond belief.  It is a commentary we need to see in America in order amen our hearts!,1438300800,,96,4.333333333333333
7148598,3,B00WQT2R0Y,Nice photographs of Salgado's photographs though lacking as a movie.  The interlocutor tries a Werner Herzog but he is unfortunately not of the same caliber so the dialog is disjointed and the movie meanders. That the movie switches languages periodically from French to English to Portuguese does not help things either.,1438214400,,321,5.294117647058823
7148599,5,B00WQT2R0Y,Great story about the brilliant artist Sebatiao Selgado. His images and life story are breath taking and life changing.,1438214400,2,119,5.315789473684211

7148601,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"Obviously the brief synopsis and cover images on here are WAY off base but the film itself is great, I've been a fan of Salgado since I saw the show on the Ethiopian famine back in the mid 80's. If you're looking for a film about nature photography this isn't it, it is a powerful, moving and gut wrenching account of the human condition spanning decades.",1437523200,9,355,4.393939393939394

8713902,4,B00WQT2R0Y,"This is a well-made film, but unrelentingly depressing. Beware. You will see bodies of murdered children and all kinds of other atrocities, one after the other. It is truly a marathon of documentation of human evil.",1529107200,,215,5.0
8713903,1,B00WQT2R0Y,"Nowhere in description did it say it couldn't play in Region 1. By time I discovered it, it was too late to return. And I really want to see this film!",1527465600,2,151,3.903225806451613
8713904,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"I liked this DVD of Salgado's works so much that I bought one for all our sons and our friends as a holiday gift!  The photos are magnificent and thoughtful, pensive really, and gives one a most different view of life on earth and of those who've had good fortune or not. Life can be hard for so many of us but there is a dignity and a beauty to be found.  I wish I could have known Salgado.",1525824000,,391,3.9367088607594938
8713905,1,B00WQT2R0Y,"This is a beautiful documentary that I viewed at a film festival and was hoping to have a copy of.  But this copy/version is a terrible product.  I, and others were unable to play it due to some bizarre ""region code"" required.  None of us has the same brand of DVD player.  When I was contacted the company I was given complicated instructions as to how it ""might"" play.",1521504000,2,370,4.318840579710145
8713906,5,B00WQT2R0Y,"Astounding in capturing humanity at its worse cruelty in starvation, world migration, war, gold mining. Sebastiao Salgado is a witness to cultures never or rarely seen. He has a gift of non intrusion at the same time as he captures images of humanity around the  world.",1520726400,,269,4.8478260869565215

8713908,4,B00WQT2R0Y,"This is a soft production from Wim Wenders. Salgado's images are anything but soft edged but in the film he appears to offer descriptions in too sentimental a manner. Perhaps not Wender's best moment. Perhaps not Salgado's best moment.
The production and content is wonderful, nevertheless.",1511222400,,290,5.326086956521739
8713909,5,B00WQT2R0Y,Phenomenal photography fills a fantastic film full of facts and feelings.,1508889600,,73,5.7272727272727275
