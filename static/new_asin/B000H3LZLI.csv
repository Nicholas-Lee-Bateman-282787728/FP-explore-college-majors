There is no detailed explanation about the tactic or technique. I have a background in this stuff, so I found it interesting picking apart the methods and performance of the students. Some of it though, is beyond me! I certainly do not see a useful application in police work by dropping people off boats into the water. Navy Seals, UDT, sure: police SWAT, I don't think so. This DVD should be looked upon as entertainment, not as a learning tool.  It's O.K, but that's all.",1306972800,,646,4.6173913043478265
8136156,3,B000H3LZLI,"This is a DVD that Mr Habermehl have had someone filming when he is teaching a Special operations course. You see techniques like W-formation, Mobile hostage Rescue, Clearing a T-Shaped hall, stairs, wall flood etc.

Some things you see clearly and others not. An important note is listen to what he say or you might miss something. I think the DVD is alright and I learned a lot from it but still I am missing more in depth explainings on some things (i.e actions on in a W-formation etc). The sound is alright and not as bad as in the DVD High Risk Entry. Anyway a 3 star it is.",1175299200,,580,4.2727272727272725
