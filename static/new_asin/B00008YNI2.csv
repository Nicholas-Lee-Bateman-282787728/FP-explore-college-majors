1873283,4,B00008YNI2,"Be urgently warned that this film may make you sick to your stomach by it's extremely wild hand held camera movements and/or by it's intensely graphic physical violence. However, that doesn't mean this film isn't worth seeing!
As I entered the cinema the usher warned me, ""This film contains very violent images and some people find it too disturbing."" This is the first time I can remember being so urgently warned. The film begins rather confusingly with a shot of Philippe (Philippe Nohon I) speaking to another man. He was the main character of Gaspar Noe's previous film Seul Contre Tous and here he is playing the same man some time in the future after the end of that movie. However, the short discussion between these two men is irrelevant to the plot of this film's story. The camera then winds down to a club called Rectum where there are ambulances and arguing occurring. Obviously something horrible has taken place. Through the rest of the film we are told the story of what did happen through scenes moving back in time. The intense confusion of the club, with it's just visible characters and camera shots careening almost out of control, slows down over the course of the film. So do not worry that you will be made to feel so horrifically dizzy over the entire film. The very sad tale that follows explains the motivations that drive people to such rash, terrifying actions.
Representations of violence have always been hotly debated and this film seems to set itself as one of the supreme examples how violent a film can be with its extremely realistic killing and rape scenes. What's more horrible is that these scenes are so heavily prolonged that they seem to take hours. Because the performances by the main actors Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel are so committed we feel that the dramatic events are that much more real. Leave it to French cinema to push the limits as by historic examples of extreme films it has produced. Another aspect which makes this film markedly French is it's inclusion of the long scene of a man and a woman partly or completely unclothed wandering through their apartment meditating on love and life in between sex. (This recurs often in French cinema. See Le Mepris.)
Part of being made to feel so intensely uncomfortable is that your senses are put on alert and your thoughts are mixed with emotion. Only much later, in contemplating your memories of the events are you able to logically consider what you've seen. This film leaves you with lasting impressions which force you to meditate on the nature of violence, love and despair long after watching it. If you watch this film thinking in terms of representation you could make the argument it is homophobic in the way it begins with shots of a dark, seedy, out of control gay club and ends with a shot of a happy and bright heterosexual environment. Nevertheless, with the strong impact this film causes, it does make you to think very seriously about what it shows you. Some people may just not have the stomach for such a BIG attack of the senses.",1048723200,9,3058,4.707089552238806
1873284,4,B00008YNI2,"""Irreversible"" is a graphic and violent film that intentionally leaves nothing to the imagination,including watching a man's face disintegrate as it is bashed in with a fire extinguisher, and a very intense nine-minute, single shot rape scene (with one of France's top actresses).
""Irreversible"" is definitely a serious piece of film making. It is raw, emotional, powerful, and shocking. The use of flashbacks is sequential - we see the 'end' scene first, then the scene that led up to it, then the scene that led up to that, and so on. It is full of disturbing images and innovative camera techniques. It can be described as a journey from hell to heaven. We start in reverse by seeing--at the beginning of the film--terrible scenes that are the conclusion of events we have yet to witness in flashback, slowly moving us from nightmare to bliss.
The first 'nightmare' scene is in a gay sex club somewhere in France. The soundtrack has a steady note that reverberates insistently like an audio depiction of a throbbing headache. The camera, hand held, thrashes wildly around in the dimly red-lit areas, catching up with and following the two men out for revenge. It slows somewhat to focus on the apparent object of their anger. The initial attack is thwarted, but the second of the two men takes over and pummels the victims head to a pulp - and we see the face and head disintegrate under blows as it is mercilessly bashed with a fire extinguisher. It is a scene that is very hard to take, but it makes sense, and is definitely
justified, as the almost nonexistant plot unfolds. Halfway through the scene, I realized I couldn't take it anymore, and had to turn away. No matter how hard I shut my eyes and shifted in my seat, the pulsing soundtrack of the beating blared out of the speakers, making it just as uncomfortable with my eyes closed. Terrifying and disgusting just doesn't cut it, the effect is indescribable.
Next we follow the attackers before they reach the nightclub. We learn that they are hunting the perpetrator of a violent rape on the girlfriend of one of them. The film is still not easy to watch, but the jerkiness of the camera slows enough to allow us the indulgence of following some sort of plot. The anger of the two men as they try to trace their intended victim is still uncomfortable viewing.
Next we see the rape scene. This time the camera is motionless. The movement and struggle of the victim - for nine long minutes -becomes paramount. Monica Belluci is a brilliant actress
because she conveys the pain and anguish this character is going through, making us feel for her. It all seems a bit too real and is definitely one of the most disturbing scenes in motion picture
history, becoming a bit much to take. Things become even more emotional as we see this woman's life BEFORE the rape took place. We look at how perfect everything had been, and how happy she was. It definitely packs a punch, and the reverse order of the sequences make it all the more disturbing and emotionally powerful. Belluci is masterful at the emotions she conveys. This woman is definitely someone you could know, and that alone makes the film more moving.
""Irreversible"" is hard to take and easy to quarrel with, but it is also a brillint and amazing film. When a movie lingers in your mind until you go to bed, and is the first thing you think about in themorning, you KNOW it has made an impact. Bravo to Gaspar Noe for giving us this shocking and absorbing piece of film. Notorious for being one of the most walked out of movies of this year, ""Irreverisible"" is definitely worth sticking with. It takes some time for the initial shock to wear off, but once it does, you realize what a great movie it actually was, and is much cause for a conversation (with cigarettes) right afterward. The title could mean two things--the order in which the film takes place or the tragic event that will haunt our characters forever, which are both irreversible. Here is a film that actually makes you think. Wonderful on all levels. See it now!!!",1048636800,2,4048,4.639275766016713
1873285,3,B00008YNI2,"The camera is alive throughout the film. Its frantic, dizzying, floating movements will either hypnotize you, force you to vomit or question what the hell you're actually looking at on screen (I'm with the latter). Eventually, in a couple of scenes, the camera sobers up, only to present us images that will totally horrify and repel us.
The most infamous scenes, as everybody knows, are a rape and the beating of a man with a fire extinguisher. These scenes are violent in a way that Hollywood violence is not. And even though there are ""good"" characters defeating a ""bad"" character in the film, we are not cheering in the same way that we root for the action hero to destroy the villain.
Hollywood presents violence of an ""attractive"" sort. We don't cover our eyes while watching somebody get shot, beaten, or blown up. The realistic consequences are absent. Yet, in IRREVERSIBLE, one of the friends of a raped woman vengefully bashes the face of the rapist with a fire extinguisher until he is literally faceless. We, the audience, are terrified by this. We want the character to stop, rather than continue.
The following sequence involves a rape, that is uncut and (reportedly) seven or nine minutes long. The genius of the sequence lies in the performance by Monica Bellucci. Her terror is executed to shockingly realistic effect (as is the case with every other performance in the film). But why did Gasper Noe, the director, shoot such a scene for so long?
People ask a similar querie as to why filmmaker Larry Clark depicts young adult actors in the nude. Well, I think it's because he's brave enough to actually make films about sex and depict it in a ""realistic"" light (otherwise, why write a film about sexuality at all?). And that's what Gasper Noe is trying to do with this film, only he has made a film about the negative results of violence; unwatchable and totally graphic.
But this is a film. Film is fictional. Yet the whole point of going to the movies is to disregard the fact that what's on screen has been staged. And to watch IRREVERSIBLE is to see something that is beyond cinema, yet obviously very cinematic ( i.e. the ever mobile camera).
Will I see this film again? Probably not. Am I glad that I saw it in a theater? Yes; the film is an aural and visual experience a la REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.
However, the violence and acting is so amazingly realistic, that I just might return to it (not soon) to admire that aspect of it.",1048464000,3,2450,4.621559633027523
1873286,1,B00008YNI2,"A piece of dung in an artistic package is still a piece of dung.  This was the most SICKENING work of cinema I've ever seen.  Unless you find enjoyment in watching a rape scene in which a man forces violent anal sex on a weeping woman at knife-point, I urge you to steer clear of this one.  I'm not talking a slit-second visual flash to let you know what's happening ala Pulp Fiction, but several excrutiating minutes (felt like an eternity) of uninterrupted, graphic rape followed by beating - great, guys.  An afficionado of foreign and art films (even 'tastefully violent' ones), I went to see this movie without knowing the nausea I was in store for.  Don't make the mistake I did - stay away.",1048377600,18,697,4.5
1873287,2,B00008YNI2,"Mainstream Snuff Film (sort of)
This film left me shaken and very confused. I work in the film business and after watching the film I was suddenly very worried about the direction of ""entertainment"" in general. I've seen violence in film before. This is different. Just because I'm deeply distressed by the intensity of the images, does it make this a ""good"" film? Will we be seeing more of this, simply because it's effective? (I suspect so - it's the modus operandi of visual media).
Irreversible gives us the dubious opportunity to feel what it might be like to see a man murdered savagely and graphically in front of us. The atmosphere created just prior to this extreme moment is choreographed to be as unsettlingly realistic and unpredictable as possible. It's like watching a real moment, bled of any sense of artifice.
Thanks to Jean-Christophe Spadaccini (who created the heads which are destroyed,) and to Mac Guff Ligne (the Paris based fx house which augmented the effects digitally) we are witness to all the horror that one might expect to see in a snuff film. Without the intensity of the violence, the film serves as a sophomoric, manipulative revenge drama. Sophmoric because, without time reversed, we have a film about a sexy girl with a complex life who we get to see graphically raped, and then follow the more dynamic storyline of the attempt by boyfriends to find and kill the rapist. Unlike Haneke's ""Funny Games"", there is no insight behind the audacity.
The rape scene, the other aspect of this film's notoriety, is far less troubling than the earlier(subsequent) murder. There is no voyeurism at play here and there is thankfully (a little) more restraint in depiction. However, the fact that the film cares more about the interests of macho rage and its more aggressive possibilities than what women endure from rape is problematic. More so since the beginning of the story (the end of the film) is all about her, at least as a visual/sexual archetype. It's seems like once she's battered to a pulp she's no longer visually useful to the real story.
The philosophy behind it is troubling, too, for several reasons. Nietzsche has often been trotted out by intellectuals in France (particularly during the period that Mr. Noe was in high school). Morally untethered power as a challenge to established authority and as an effective social critique seems to underly his published justification for making this film.
However, in real terms, Gaspar Noe is on record as wanting to make a Hollywood Porn Film - ""Irreversible"" is what he ended up making.

1873288,4,B00008YNI2,"For the majority of people ""Irreversible"" will probably be remembered as the film with the 9min. rape scene involving Monica Bellucci. Still, if you belong to that category, you may actually be missing the point.
Ok, it is a shockingly violent film at times. Also it is true that some extreme reactions of the characters may, at first, seem irrelevant. But as the story keeps unwinding in a reverse manner, rightfully reminding us of ""Memento"", the pieces fall in the right places and everything seems logical. Cruel but logical.
""Irreversible"" tells a story of revenge or as its director, Gaspar Noe, put it in an interview, ""it depicts how people act when they find themselves in extreme situations"". And you don't have to wait long, before you can realize that. The real challenge for the viewer lies in the film's opening minutes, in a sequence which, in my opinion, beats even the rape scene itself. The camera is in constant motion - moving up and down, left and right, the light is almost non-existent, while the music, loud and sharp, hurts the ears. You can sense in the atmosphere that something is very wrong. And soon, bang, you'll get your chance to see that you were not mistaken.
If that is not hell, then it should be darn close.",1048118400,5,1245,4.689497716894977
1873289,4,B00008YNI2,"Told in reverse chronological order, IRREVERSIBLE follows two men through the streets of France in an effort to seek revenge on the man who had brutally raped and beaten their dear friend and lover, Alex. There is no mistake that this film is both clever and violent. Moving from extreme depravity to bittersweet serenity, this film is likely to affect the viewer long after they have left the theatre. I cringed and wiggled in my seat during the scenes of extreme violence, but the nine-minute rape scene particularly affected me. Being a woman this scene touched on one of my ultimate fears of being sodomised and beat into a coma. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination; everything is put on the wide screen to digest regardless of the audience's wishes. I believe IRREVERSIBLE is a highly original film that speaks volumes to the limits one would go to correct a wrong. There's lots of substance in this film and is worth a second viewing if only I could fast-forward through the violence. Definately not for those with a weak stomach or delicate senses. I believe if one is able to sit through the gore, they will walk away with a renewed sense of humanity.",1048032000,23,1167,4.697560975609756

1873291,4,B00008YNI2,"This is one hell of a movie: difficult to watch (in the extreme), extended use of shakey cam, overall an uneasy movie-going experience. But if you can get through all that, I think it's worth it to see this flick. There are few films like this out there, or made, ever. Irreversible is an exercise in agit prop by Gaspar Noe, whose previous film I Stand Alone was along the same lines though not as extreme.
Irreversible prods you into thinking, but more strongly into feeling. You should look away during the horrendous and very bloody scenes but you can't (at least I couldn't, and I'm squeemish). I'm glad I saw this film and I'm glad it was made. I should warn you, however, that the film may stay with you for a while after you watch it, it did with me. I was upset in a low-level way for a few hours after viewing it. So be warned.
This is one of the few films I will never see again; there's no need. The bottom line: I would see 20 films that were as bloody and violent and visually assaultive as this one than huge Hollywood hits like Bringing Down the House. Gaspar Noe had a real personal reason to make this film, and it comes through every brutal frame.",1047340800,3,1166,4.280542986425339
1873292,3,B00008YNI2,"Gasper Noe's feature film ""Irrersible"" is destined to be a topic of hot debate when it was shown in Canne Film Festival.  It is reported that during the rape scene that lasts almost 10 minutes, many viewers left the theatre.  And there are people who defend it, and people who attack it, as is often the case with this kind of unusual films.  However, instead of joining the debate, I would like to tell what I saw on screen as I remember, even though I was curiously attracted to the ultra-violent story of revenge.
The story, which director Noe thought of very casually, is very simple in itself.  Beautiful Alex (Monica Bellucci, real-life wife to Vincent Cassel) is a fiancee of fun-loving Marcus (Vincent Cassel), but one night after a party Alex is raped by a man and moreover her face is heavily smashed by the guy to make her unconscious.  Knowing that, Marcus hurries to the culprit with his friend Pierre to a bar for the most violent kind of revenge in the movie history.
Now I warn you.  The rape/revenge scenes are both so intense and realistic that some of you might get sick during the course even though you happen to know that Noe used CGIs to enhance the effect of violence.  But to be fair, these scenes are, I thought, overlong but nothing gratuitous.  Still, it looks as if the director wallows in making us feel uncomfortable, and I admire, without any sarcasm, his skiils so good at that.
Another unusual aspect of the film is that the story goes chronologically backward.  Noe insists on this idea so much that what you see first on screen is ""the end credit"" which rolls up (and see many names of cast, which are printed the wrong way).  And you will first see the result of revenge, then revenge itself, and then the cause of the revenge ... and so on.  The trip is exactly from hell to heaven, which we know is about to collapse.
And the camera, especially during the first 30 minutes, goes on rolling around so that you may feel seasickness.  The rotating motion is NOT that of handy camera of ""Blair Witch Project,""  but the fact remains that we feel very uncomfortable, and we have that subject matter.  The noise-like soundtrack is also effective to make us feel uneasy -- like David Lynch's films -- and the actors are so terrifyingly convincing including the rapist Jo Prestia (professinal actor and ex-boxer).
Some audiences try to defend the film by saying that Noe is only trying to tell the truth, and if so, he clearly made his point.  And I can understand that viewpoint -- we have seen an equally unsettling rape scene in one Jodie Foster film; and as for violence, Oscar winner Steven Spielberg is not a stranger to violence if you remember his WW2 film.  But those films never brought the violence to the forefront as Gasper Noe did.  In a sense, that is an admirable thing.  But if you want to pay some money for seeing that ... well, if depends.  I just happened to think so.
From the purely technical point of view, Director Noe shows his ability to create an unnerving atmosphere.  The film is shot in a unique way -- using only one shot for each scene -- so, after  one scene starts, it goes on till the scene changes to the next.  As this now very rarely used method is employed -- though some of them are the result of post-production work, which pieced together some different takes -- each shot is consequently very long, causing us another reason for having to be patiently following the ever-moving camera, which easily beats that of Brian DePalma.
For all its techinical achievement, ""Irreversible"" suffers from its own methond of storytelling.  Compared with the violent first half, the latter peaceful part looks inevitably much weaker.  Sometimes, the back-through-time tactics create an original effect; when we see too frivolous Marcus, who ignores the presence of Alex at party, we feel sense of tragedy and folly of humans, as we know what is going to happen after that scene.  The film has some unexpected moments when we think -- imagining ""what if"" situations which, as you know, are always  very futile attempts of humans as every history tells.  And of course, I know that by the combination of Alex's heaven and hell, Noe is making his own commentary about our life.  The film tells us twice on screen ""Time destroys everything"" and, right, that's another point.  But I am afraid the method is too simple and too obvious, and doesn't hold well not least after such intense violence.
Still you want to see?  OK, then, here's some tips for you that might make you understand this one better, which I quote from the booklet I bought at mutiplex in Japan.  1) Noe thought of the concept of ""Irreversible"" in May, 2001, using Cassel and possibly Bellucci.  But as she was to work for two ""Matrix"" films from September, he had very short time to prepare for actual shooting.  2) They shot the sequences chronologically, I mean in this case, from ""heaven"" to ""hell.""  3) You see Philippe Nahon as ex-butcher, who was in Noe's previous films.  The dialgues are all ad-lib.  4) Noe had difficulties in ""ending"" the film (in this case, the most peaceful scene of Mercus and Alex making love).  There seem to have been several versions, but he decided on the present one, which shows a poster of one masterpiece film.  That film's director, now gone for some years, is famous for a film starring Malcolm McDowell, who played a role of ""Alex"" -- well, Noe must respect Stanley Kubrick.
As a whole, for my part, I confess I was very much impressed with the film.  But because of the nature of the film, I cannot ""recommend"" this one to you.  I wrote down what I know.  That's why I give only three stars.",1046304000,352,5658,4.5900497512437815

I liked the camera and art direction because it added to the suspense and dis ease of the whole tone, a tension building and spiraling if you will. It made me feel uncomfortable but I didn't want to turn it off. The story is a terrible one but one I identify with. The famous revenge scene made me feel like I was going to have a panic attack but I stayed with it. Unfortunately, I personally could not watch the assault against the girlfriend in its entirety as it is a trigger but I did watch the end of the scene and fastforwarded thru the rest where I could still see it pass by but not hear it. Maybe I need to see the whole scene to understand the full scope of the emotions of the story and characters but I was not able as of yet to watch. It was enough for me to get the emotion and pain and terror and violence behind her and her assailant's experience. I liked the reverse order of the film as well, letting us as viewers know the outcome and then seeing how the day began for this couple in happier, unknowing times. I was struck by the very end or the opening scene with the two men shooting the shit in the bed. It was disturbing and foreboding without even knowing what was about to happen next or in their case, what had transpired underneath them minutes before. The one thing I didn't like was the very end (or would be beginning) as it didn't make as much of an impact on me than I would like. I feel it could have been a better choice of scene or added spoken words. But it still provoked something in me that is almost indescribable, something I almost can't stop thinking about days later. I love the insight into fate and Destiny; I think everyone can relate to impending doom and little choices that have disastrous implications or outcomes. And the film speaks to the underbelly of society, the speedier side of things and people, the darker sides of life and human beings, the explicit or horribly violent or even primal sides to some or all human nature. I enjoy darker movies and this is one of those. Perhaps my favorite piece was the true assailant's face as he watches the brutal scene of revenge unfolding in the gay sex club.

As an interesting starting point in the film, I believe Noe  presents the  character from his prior work, ""I Stand Alone""  [the""butcher""], having a discussion with a fellow flop house  tenant , unrelated to the main story.  It does sort of  give the viewer a minute update on what happened to the butcher from the prior film.

I am an art house movie fan more than anything and i thought i was getting into a dark character study type of film. I watched this based on a recommendation. I am not a fan of violence but do appreciate it when it is done for an effective purpose like Antichrist.
With this film i honestly felt that the violence was just for shock as well as the graphic sex scenes.
I am not a fan of films that seem artsy and fool american viewers just because it has subtitles.
I will be honest the scene where the guy beats the other guys face in with a fire extinguisher was very realistic and stands out for me as the most memorable scene. The problem here is why does it stand out and the answer is--for shock value only and bad shock value at that.
An example of a movie that has shock value for a solid artistic message would be Salo.  This is not salo.

1873514,5,B00008YNI2,"Of course I cannot say, and would never say that I 'loved' the tragedy portrayed. What I loved about this film foremost are the intellectual, artistic, and emotional courage of Noe and of all of the actors in creating a look at the human story, horrible as this one is. My emotions were hijacked from the first moments, of course, and I felt terrified, helpless, dismayed and aghast at what was unfolding --- or I should say what had unfolded. The experience was a terrific challenge for me personally, but as a writer myself, I had to stay with it and not look away or find a reason to disembark.

(I have to confess, though, that as a screenwriter, I couldn't completely stop thinking ""how (or why) did he choose to do that?"" This is a reaction I have given up trying to block or battle. I'll never lose myself in a film the way I did before I wrote my first script. I'm amazed, though not surprised, to learn that the shooting script was three pages long!)

The human story --- not only the violent part of it --- is what seized me, and that is really why the film is a success. I loved the trio of young, impulsive, affectionate people, unaware of what was bearing down on them. I certainly don't judge them for leading a ""shallow"" life, as some have. They are born into this life and trying to make the most of it. The bitter truth at the center of this film is that the arrow of time in our physical universe commands, without any possiblity of appeal, that we must forever live in ignorance of the future. We cannot foresee the looming consequences --- moments away --- of an often minor decision: a turn left or right; a look or a failure to look; the microscopic flaw deep in the machinery of the aircraft, and so forth. We can only transcend the laws of physics through art. (I am not a believer in the supernatural in any way.)

This film reveals the story of these particular three people, but countless events are happening at every moment, to us and to everyone else, and always have, and always will. So the beauty of this film is Noe's ability to narrow on one tragic story among the infinite many, and then expand it to bring us within, so powerfully and grippingly that we can barely endure it.

The vertigo effects I stuck with as well; to me, they represent Noe's efforts to destroy any illusion that we are in control of our fates: that our own perception is the actuality, the reality. The sickness, physical nausea and mental disorientation are the effect on us of that truth. How powerless we are to interrupt or control or change reality. We are on the ride, like it or not. We can walk out of the theater, we can be furious; we can dismiss and disparage, but reality doesn't care. It spins away and away and away.

Irreversible intensified my deep sadness at how every living thing uniquely suffers its fate. I don't read or see films for entertainment, although I am usually vastly entertained, and I love humor and satire, which keep me happy and as sane, as I will ever be. But I'm inspired and also envious of this work. I thank the actors and everyone who dedicated themselves to it.",1515974400,,3114,4.418118466898955

The way the camera flies, spins and dances has significance as an unbiased observer and a mirror of the character's emotional states at once. Gaspar Noe obviously has a phenomenal vision of cinematography between this and Enter the Void and they are worth seeing just for it.
This feels like a personal story Noe wanted to share with the world without shying away from some horrific aspects of life.

1873550,4,B00008YNI2,"This film IS reversed, hence the LIE of the title is truthfully / stylistically, presented from the beginning. And it has a happy ending, with beautiful music! But because the movie is reversed, the true ending is at the beginning, so Gaspar wins with his stylistic nihilism. Is this bleak nihilism truly the game he wishes to win?

I went to a live interview of Gaspar Noe to see a special viewing of Into the Void. With extreme films such as Irreversible it is very useful to 'detect' the character of the director to see what their 'mission' is - or are they randomly filling culture with destructive, offensive film? (Fine: some people judge the art object itself, regardless of its origin, artists intention. I am not one of those.) At least so far, all of Noe's films represent nihilism (Seul Contre Tous, Irreversible, Into the Void)  - pointless and detached views where the essence of life is cruelty, godless, cold. It is useful to be aware of such views, but ultimately, it's facile. Most people don't walk through a constant Hell.

Watch Noe's short film in Destricted, about loveless sex, that goes on and on and on - it's creepy, claustrophobic, insular. It's also, interesting to compare the film to the other directors visions of sex (the video is an anthology). For instance Mathew Barney's film is a very good counterpoint, essentially, the theme is the same, singular sex, but it is manifested totally differently. Where Noe's vision is desperate, lost, can't help using the word . . . nihilistic. Barney's take on the same act is positive; still weird, but not weird in an alienating way.

So, seeing Noe in a live interview? Such a surprise. He's charismatic, cute, funny. Knowing Noe's work in film, he's difficult to fathom in a half hour. How do you link the two? This friendly guy and his stylish, nasty films. I have also seen Michael Haneke interviewed live, in a special screening of Funny Games uncensored. He comes across as much more of a 'full' being. He is caring, honest, responsible and has a philosophical approach to things. You can tell from his words and bearing that he takes film seriously, he has conviction, his work is a fully-considered response to add dialogue to make people think, offering a view which questions Hollywoods more entertainment-centric bias. I know where I am with Haneke. With Gaspar, given his extreme films, I do sort of wonder why he makes them. They don't fully justify themselves, when you consider the same message in all of his film. Yes, life can be pointless, but that isn't the same as saying life is pointless full stop.",1509148800,,2595,4.76
1873551,2,B00008YNI2,"I saw no purpose to this movie. I usually look to be entertained and, if not, at least come away with a message. I got neither. The subject matter is no different than the things we hear on the news nearly every day; the only difference being that we get an up-close-and-personal look. I sat through the whole film, not feeling the need to look away but for a few seconds during the fire extinguisher scene. The constant ""spiraling"" of the footage in the beginning of the movie gave me a headache and made it difficult to concentrate on what was happening. Some may consider this brilliant film-making. I found it annoying. All in all, not a movie I'd recommend unless you have 90 minutes to waste.",1509062400,,698,4.503937007874016
1873552,4,B00008YNI2,"I think ""irreversible"" ultimately refers to the lead character Alex and her loss of innocence in her boyfriend and her whole bourgeois way of life.  What triggers events in the movie is when Monica Bellucci learns she is pregnant. Clearly she wants to start a family and her lover Vincent Cassel obviously does not want the baby or family responsibilities. These repressed tensions erupt at a drug party which leads to an argument, her leaving of the party, and ultimately her excruciating rape scene.

I think critics are right to point out that this movie is mostly a dream or dream-like sequence from Monica's POV. The rape is an external representation of how Bellucci feels already--she feels brutalized and degraded by Cassel's disrespect for her and her ambition for a life beyond partying and snorting. What follows chronologically is a descent into brutality and cultural collapse that mirror Bellucci's sense of disappointment in the people and the world around her--friends, acquaintances all fall away from here. What seemed like a cozy lifestyle with rock music, recreational drug use, and casual sex is now presented as chaos, a violent and depraved way of life that she needs to put behind her. The question of course is whether or not that's possible. She may not be capable of leading a normal or family life after her physical abuse and her emotional revelations about her way of life.

The backwards telling of the story and the wobbly camera work all convey a sense of a world gone haywire. All the conventions of society--language, communication, morals--are topsy-turvy. The visual style of the movie complements Bellucci's epiphany about her lover and her friends.

BUT--it must be admitted that the violence and language are gratuitous. Sometimes the virtuoso camera work seems too showy. It's more confusing than it needs to be.",1507420800,,1853,5.065573770491803

My husband loves films like Kill Bill, Dog Day Afternoon and things in that genre.  When the rape scene was happening he got so disgusted he stormed out of the room and refused to watch anymore.  I was able to finish the film.  As a poster said, this will stay with you and cause a sense of inner dread that carries over much later.  It can make you depressed and upset for hours.

To watch the scene that is often criticized in this film is a tremendous experience. It is shot in real time. There are no cutaways. You are as helpless as the character. There is no glorification. It is executed by one of the most sensual actresses on the planet, who is so gorgeous to watch in this story, and yet there is nothing libido-stimulating about that scene, which not many directors pull off. Noe does this powerfully. It will make you feel sad and angry, because that SHOULD be your reaction. I thank him for educating his viewers who might not otherwise be forced to sympathize with the subjugated of this planet--I feel this is essential viewing, with the ultimate takeaway being that there are some actions that cannot be taken back--cannot be reversed.

I doubt if this will be the case, however.  The people who enjoy movies like this are probably as sick as the characters portrayed in it.  I had read about it in some film reviews and became curious.  I watched about 15 minutes of it, skipping around and pausing shortly -- enough to understand.  It's a horrible movie.

Movies like this defy and reject convention, both topic-wise and technique-wise, and I applaud it for that more than anything. The excessive camera swiveling, and the only reason I rate this 4-stars, was the only asset that wore out its welcome. While I can appreciate this movie's slower pacing, having those careening camera movements during moments without action just proves to work up a sickness rather than nerves, but there were times where I thought the effect was complementary, especially in between each scene transition.

This movie is a needed upset to the comfort and complacency of everyday life. The subtle ironies paired with its graphic truths had me patting myself down and grateful for both my physical and mental welfare. When a movie can do that to me, it has my complete respect.
As stated in the reviews before me, It's not for everyone, though. More than the profanities and the violence, it's a story that moves beyond the characters, the setting, and us.

1873891,4,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible starring the captivating french actress Monica Bellucci is one of the most twisted and shocking films I have ever seen. It takes a certain patience as well as stomach for hard-core violence to not only watch the film, but to process and appreciate what is unfolding before you. The film is unique because as the title suggests it happens not in linear fashion but in ""reverse"" The opening scene is the last scene and every scene after it is the scene before it. Sound confusing? It certainly takes a while to get on track with what is going on. The lighting, music and in your face hand-held camera angles give the impression you have entered your worst nightmare that takes place inside the gates of hell. As the film moves along--backwards--we follow our heroine in Paris with her boyfriend and friends during one evening. The acting is quite good, and once you get ""in the flow"" with your backwards ride, you are confronted by the horror of what happened to this woman. Without giving anything away, Irreversible contains two of the most graphically violent scenes--in real time--that I think have ever been put on film. Like, EVER. One of them is seven minutes long and it is excruciating to watch. Three quarters in I was anxiety ridden, nervous and begging the nightmare to END. Yet, I couldn't stop watching. As the film draws to a close we get to the end (beginning) And we are left shattered, haunted and wondering ""what the hell"" just happened!

1873892,4,B00008YNI2,"This movie was hard to watch for more than one reason.  Most obviously, the content matter is tough enough and, while it is well done, its depiction is brutal.  Even for someone that isn't triggered by such things, it was gut-churning to sit through.  If you are someone who can tolerate the subject matter and its portrayal in such a stark and in-your-face manner, this movie is worth a watch.  I like the reverse chronology.  As for the other reason it's hard to watch, I have to mention the camera movement.  It has a lot of overhead sweeps, off-center cuts, and sometimes shaky and strangely angled shots.  For someone that has issues with motion sickness, there were times when I had to look away to keep from getting woozy.",1467676800,,729,4.604651162790698

1873915,5,B00008YNI2,"I am going to first preface my review by saying that I am  a woman.  That I watched this film on  Netflix  first without knowing  anything about the  filmmaker or what the film was  about.  And  I fully admit I thought NF was  malfunctioning  when the credits rolled.  I had  no idea I had  just  gotten on a Rollercoaster,  in the dark,  without being able to see where the track went. And  what an  amazing  ride!  There is  nothing I can  say that would put it any better than that of the people in the top reviews.  This is an  amazing  work of  cinema,  though unbearably difficult to watch in  parts.  But as  a movie goer (and  avid reader)  I am  sometimes left unsatisfied by the  unrealistic happy  happy joy joy of  the fairytale land that is Hollywood.  It's  predictable and  unchallenging.  There are times when I want to see  a movie or read  a book and  I want to  ""experience""  it. I want to be left  disturbed.  I want my thoughts and  feeling and  emotions torn to shreds and  leaving me uncomfortable.  Not in a gratuitous Friday the 13th manner but in  a deeply thought provoking manner to which the psyche is seeking answers. This film  does that.  Viewers will either like this film or they won't.

1873955,5,B00008YNI2,"1. Directed by Gaspar No, this film is usually considered to be part of the New French Extremity movement in cinema, which is a confrontational type of French filmmaking comprised of explicit sex, extreme physical cruelty, psychological trauma, and a nihilistic attitude. This movie checks off all four of those boxes.

2. Film critic Roger Ebert summarized the film by saying, ""Irreversible is a movie so violent and cruel that most people will find it unwatchable."" But he wasn't telling people not to watch it. If you read his full review, you realize that he understood what No was doing.

3. The thing you need to know up front is that the movie is shown in reverse chronological order. It begins with the ending credits, then shows the final scene, then the climax, and so on, through the most excruciating rape scene that I've ever seen, and back to the beginning.

4. Some people (especially the ones that haven't seen it) accuse the movie of being pornographic and accepting of rape culture. But by going backwards, and showing all the violence and depravity before the buildup instead of after, the movie becomes the opposite of pornography. And it's most definitely anti-rape.

5. There is a brief discussion among the characters about time and whether everything that happens is destined to happen. This movie shows us the consequences of people's choices before the choice itself, so it's not as easy to reject that notion as it may seem.

And not very many people seem to catch the movie's biggest apparent contradiction - the movie is called Irreversible... but we watch it in reverse order. This movie messes with your head on all levels.

6. As the movie goes backwards, and we see the three main actors in happier and happier scenes, we get a very odd sense of despair, because we know what's going to happen to them, but the characters don't. They make little jokes that would have seemed funny or cute if we had watched the movie in the traditional sense; but knowing what we do, those jokes are awkward and disturbing.

7. Not only does the film happen backwards, but director Gaspar No, uses dizzying camera work and lighting effects to show the breaks between scenes in such a way that the whole movie seems to be shot in one long camera movement.

8. What's often lost in all the controversy and wildness of the film are the performances themselves. In particular, Vincent Cassell and Monica Bellucci are absolutely amazing in their roles as the boyfriend and girlfriend who are tossed into hell in the space of about 30 minutes.

9. Irreversible was a transformative experience for me. No makes this film dizzying, disorienting, disgusting, and disturbing. But it's also an awe-inspiring piece of art and philosophy, and bears up under scrutiny. Each time I force myself to watch it again, I find some other new tidbit makes the movie even more relevant - for the art of cinema, and for myself.",1455580800,53,2919,4.775793650793651

It scares me because I know there really are people like this. A real study of the underbelly of humanity. In the end I'm afraid I didn't care for it much.",1453939200,,442,4.5375

1873983,3,B00008YNI2,"So I'm no movie critic, but here's my two cents on the film: first of all, it could use an epilepsy warning because the beginning and end have some seriously intense flashing going on. That was the only part I covered my eyes. The gruesome scenes are very well done, but not unwatchable. They look pretty damn real and aren't over simulated like some of today's movies. I think I saw more penises than breasts (considering each woman would get two breasts compared to a man's one penis, that was very shocking) but that might be my American titty-centric expectations. The backwards chronology and strange camera angle was interesting, but overall I was not impressed with the plot. I only finished it out of spite of paying for the rental, and was left with a boring end (at least in my opinion) and more flashing lights.

1873986,2,B00008YNI2,"From what I could tell, absolutely nothing was happening in the first five+ minutes of this film.  Maybe two minutes worth of substance.  The visuals are great, but not great enough to excuse defeating the purpose of a video camera -- to show!  The camera kept moving away from the scene.  The camera shows a guy in an ambulance after showing us the guy being put in the ambulance, and we hear a bunch of hateful words being tossed around, and instead of going to another scene or continuing to let this scene unfold, the camera keeps moving away from the ambulance.  There's five seconds (maybe more) of architecture showcasing - just the cameraman admiring(?) a building...it's not a bad looking building per se, but set design should not solely constitute any of a film's run time.  It wasn't a unique building.  It was made of concrete, grey.  If this were BATMAN RETURNS or GHOSTBUSTERS, the case could be won that the set design is such a sight to behold that it would be a waste of material resources and time *not* to showcase it.  But a city building is not interesting.  It's not unique.  I don't know why the director chose to slow the film down by inserting footage that is neither stimulating nor necessary to the understanding of the story.  I turned the film off at that point, assuming the director either *accidentally* left excess footage in the film or that this kind of filler was an ongoing thing and thus 10% of the film would be boring.  I guess you could give 90% of this film 3 or 4 stars.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't have any way for me to fracture my rating based on which parts of the film I liked and which I didn't.",1447804800,,1648,4.4865771812080535

I saw it several years ago and liked it very much-it takes a few minutes to get used to the 'reverse' story telling line, but like Memento it grows on you.
The film to me shows situations and experiences that are not reversible, forgettable and cant be un done. And these things stay with you and in some way shape your future-even if you try to reconcile them with your past and how your choices got you to where you are.
its visually gritty and realistic-bloody and violent , but it does make you think.

1874017,2,B00008YNI2,"This is one Ive been hearing about for years. Probably since it came out, Id been hearing a lot of things about Irreversible, mainly for THE SCENE. Since you're looking through reviews for this movie, theres a 99% chance you know exactly what Im talking about. Irreversible was in my queue for a couple of years. It took me a long time to get around to it because I didn't want to watch it on a night when I was in a really good mood, or when I was down for whatever reason. I wanted to be neutral and pretty awake. I stayed away from any kind of long plot summary, and only knew that this was a revenge movie, supposedly one of the most brutal ones out there. I can see how that wouldve been the case when the movie came out, and as a result, I think this is one better left to people who haven't seen many brutal revenge movies. Had I watched Irreversible the year it came out, or even not too long after, Id probably appreciate it more.

After a long, annoying, opening credits that starts to spin to get you a feeling for the tone of the movie (seriously, just jump ahead 3 minutes or so to avoid this), were introduced to two older men on a bed in a small room, just having a small conversation. It turns out that one of them slept with his own daughter. They then hear a ruckus outside, and were taken to the aftermath of a horrible scene at a bar, with a man being put into an ambulance on a stretcher. Another man is leaving in handcuffs, seemingly aware of what he did and whats going to happen to him. Cut to right before that and its clear that the movie is going in reverse. We see the man who was in the ambulance, and the one being arrested, storming the bar looking for someone. One of them, Pierre, is hesitant to do anything and the other, Marcus, looks like hes ready to kill whoever prevents him from finding the man. Eventually, Marcus does find him, and it doesnt go his way- he ends up on the floor in no time and gets his arm broken. Pierre steps in, knocks the dude aside, and proceeds to smash the heck out of his head with a fire extinguisher, rendering it into a literal bloody pulp. It aint pretty. From here, we go back to find out what led them to this gruesome act of violence.

I know people are going to take one look at my rating and then vote on it being not helpful, because for some reason a lot of people who read reviews have already dealt with whatever the product is, and just want to make sure others agree with them. I get this movie. I get why the camera spins and moves around so much for the first third of the movie, ok? I get that one of the main points in the movie, when alls said and done, is to show that our actions are irreversible, and that nothing good ever comes from revenge. That being said, I was bored from beginning to end. So much in this film feels like its trying to be unique that by the time THE SCENE happened, I was bored and waiting for it to be over with and see what happened prior to that part. That scene goes on for several minutes, and Im sure Im going to get heat for this part especially, but it didn't make me feel anything. Its the first time we really see Monica Belluccis character, Alex, so for all we know, this is a complete stranger that its happening to, and we have zero connection to her. Of course its still a terrible thing thats happening, but its equal to when some no name character in a movie gets murdered, at least to me it is. Apart from the fire extinguisher smashing, there wasn't anything here that seemed all that brutal to me. In fact, compared to a few other movies Ive seen (all of varying quality), the violence and sex scenes here are pretty average.

If theres anything I liked, its that I appreciated that each segment was seemingly done in one take. There are never cuts to show closeup reactions or to transition from scene to scene. The camera follows the stars wherever they are, and only moves along to another angle when we go to an earlier part of the day. Also, by the end (well, beginning I guess) of the movie, I finally kind of liked Marcus, because his scene with Alex when they're just in bed waking up made them seem like a real couple. The way they interacted with each other was very believable, and they looked like two people in love. Sure enough, I checked Vincent Cassels bio and him and Monica were married! I was gonna say, with some of the areas he got to put his face in, she mustve been at least dating him at that time, or Monica is just that carefree when it comes to nakedness in movies!

As bored as I was, for the most part, the movie still has an interesting enough main plot of Marcus and Pierre finding the criminal that kept me from turning it off. A lot of the segments feel too long, especially the one on the subway, and some viewers may be turned off by the filming style used for the first section of the movie since it goes along with the downward spiral into madness and being on drugs. I don't recommend it as something you should see, but at the same time, you may as well watch it just so you can say you saw it.",1440633600,5,5065,4.175869120654396

The conception of Irreversible is phenomenal all by itself, let alone the film's brilliant use of lighting and sound. This movie is not for the light-hearted and includes rather graphic depictions early on, but if you start this film make sure you watch the entire thing.

How anybody is suppose to figure out the rapist got away, dunno.  It's an insult to Stanley Kuberick to have a poster of 2001: A Space Odyssey at the end, trying to suggest this movie was something like that.  I figured that movie out in the first setting, and I was 12.  The infamous rape scene isn't that bad, I've seen worse, except for the end of the scene when he beats the hell out of her and puts her in a comma.  The killing with the fire extinguisher was far worse.  Having the scenes shown in reverse order seems clever at first, considering the name, but at the end you have the feeling it is just a gimmick for a smiplistic plot.  I've just watched the beginning multiple times to figure out how anybody was suppose to know the wrong man was killed and the rapist got away.  The spinning camera, the dim but flashing lights, and too many people to keep track of, dunno how I was suppose to recognize the bad guy at the rape scene.  Ugh.  Pretentious, gimmicky movie, and I didn't even hint at the pointless unneeded violence...  I want my 10 bucks back.  And the time I wasted watching this mess.",1420934400,,1255,4.408695652173913

1874162,5,B00008YNI2,"This movie is not for the weak of stomach.  This movie is not for the easily offended.  This movie is not for the politically correct crowd.  I've watched this movie three times through since having it recommended to me from a friend back home.  I've always had a thing for raw films that touch on the darker side of life.  I do not want to spoil the movie but I want to convey to you that this was a brilliantly edited film that forces you to watch it scene-by-scene backwards in time until it ends on the begging.  So Irreversible starts with the ending and finishes with the beginning.  This format forces you to pay very close attention to details and is a strong case to watch the film more than once to make sure what you are understanding or interpreting is correct.  I haven't given a film 5 stars in nearly a decade.  If you are a cult-classic aficionado that isn't squeamish viewing violence and otherwise taboo subjects in secular society this film will be up your alley.  If you don't watch it through more than once to catch the nuances of the film, the editing, and backing into the storyline I would be very surprised.  This is quite a roller coaster ride and leaves you wishing you could have seen certain outcomes in the film pan out differently.  I even found myself hoping for the well being of the characters even knowing it was only a movie.  This movie does exactly what a movie should do - elicit an emotional response.  Be it happy, sad, visceral or petrified.  This movie and my assessment is definitely subjective to one's taste.  If you can handle graphic violence and sexual content then you can look past it to find the message(s) the film is attempting to convey.",1417564800,8,1693,4.483660130718954

People are unmercifully giving this movie a negative review based on the rape scene, which is understandable to not enjoy the rape scene. Nobody is supposed to enjoy it. It's supposed to be unnerving and unsettling. OR because they simply didn't understand the movie. WHY review something you understand? Do you need that much attention? I can't imagine someone blindly finding this movie on their own; chances are you've heard of it from word of mouth, a connection with something else, or you've heard about the rape scene. So, you knowingly walk into a situation that makes you uncomfortable and you STILL bash it afterwards. Makes lots of sense.

This is a movie for fans that understand and appreciate movies along the lines of A Serbian Film, Salo: Or 120 Days of Sodom, The Life and Death of a Porno Gang, The Cannibal movies (Cannibal Holocaust, Cannibal Ferox, Zombie Holocaust, etc. etc.), or even the more popular ""horror/gore"" movies I Spit on Your Grave, The Human Centipede, and so forth.",1410307200,,1131,4.829896907216495

Renting would be good enough because you probably won't want to watch it twice.  I also wouldn't advise letting anyone under 18 watch it.  I watch a lot of horror films and am somewhat numb to that kind of violence.  The violence in this movie is much more realistic and although there's only a couple of scenes with violence, it keeps going and going and is very brutal.  The rape scene will make you never want to let your female family members leave the house.  That kind of stuff happens and it's very sad and I can't say that I need or want to watch it again.

This was a tough movie to sit through. The violence even made me turn away, especially the scene with the fire extinguisher.

Knowing that this wasn't going to be a pleasant experience, I wondered why bother attempting it in the first place? Morbid curiosity? This film takes cinema vrit well beyond the lines of empathy and gritty reality. It consciously drags its viewers into a realm of depravity through sound and imagery that deliberately wants you to ""look"" a little longer than necessary. Of the several gruesome and brutal scenes (that you know are coming), one involves a sickening under-pass sequence. An unsuspecting witness walks onto the scene, sees what is happening from a distance and instead of stepping up to help, choses to be an uninvolved bystander and leaves. I followed suit, not wanting to be part of the ""experience"" any longer myself. This film certainly does evoke and encourage discussion on several levels but I'm not sure one needs to sit through the whole thing to do so.

It is a certainty that less than five percent of the audience attracted to this film came to view him. Further, Monica, one of the most incredibly beautiful women on the planet-both in face and body, is never properly allowed to share this beauty with her audience which came to again marvel at it. During the stagnant, unimaginative, and ridiculously unending ""rape"" scene, Monica""s beauty is almost totally hidden. Stupidly, the focus is on the sick, ugly, midget-like attacker to whom Monica,a rather large, strong women, inexplicably so meekly submits.
 Secondly,the director ( with the writer?)  tortures us with a pathetically -pretentious attempts at ""art"" and profoundly meaningful content. However, all we are treated to are a camera wildly spinning and turning  for no understandable reason and a series of disconnected scenes that end abruptly, leaving us without a theme or point to the movie.

1874381,5,B00008YNI2,"There has been quite a lot of hype and controversy surrounding Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible"" and in all this the amazing, powerful, and thought-provoking film has been lost. It is true this film is not for the faint of heart but I could say that for many films (Requiem for a Dream, The Passion of the Christ etc.). That does not mean you should steer clear of this film but be aware of what you are getting yourself into.

On to the actual film:

The film is a story of love and tragedy one that transcends all levels of hate. This film is so far beyond just a rape and revenge film, such as ""I spit on your grave"". While watching this film I felt myself not overcome with anger but with compassion and sadness. The amount of emotion and atmosphere this film evokes is unmatched. It is true that there are scenes in this film that are quite graphic and disturbing but nothing feels out of place or exploitive and everything has a point. The film is told in reverse chronological order of the events of one night which changed the lives of the characters forever, which is extremely effective and deliberate. The amount of intensity and dark atmosphere the film starts out with is slowly and eventually explained as the movie plays out and as we become acquainted with the characters. All of the dialogue in the film foreshadows what is yet to come but we already know what is yet to come from watching. All of the pieces fall into place and we begin to heartbreakingly realize the truth behind it all. The cinematography is beautiful and as the film would still be impactful if it was shot the way most films are it is made far more impactful by the single shot technique which whips around in a way that almost displays the emotion of the scene. It goes without saying that the acting is brilliant and Monica Bellucci is heroic for taking on her role.

The film's atmosphere and music goes from hell to heaven in a rapid change of events but we are left with the dreaded feeling knowing that the film has actually gone from heaven to hell over the course of this night. The elated and dreaded feeling you will feel when the final words flash across the screen is one that can't be described.

I do not want to give away any more of the story line for fearing it will lessen the impact of the film. If this film is something you can take on watch it. If you plan on fast forwarding through the graphic scenes DO NOT watch it, the film will lose a massive amount of its impact.

Noe has created a masterpiece here and one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.

1874414,5,B00008YNI2,"Last week I watched Gaspar Noe's first film, ""I Stand Alone."" This week I watched ""Irreversible."" And all I can say is WOW. After seeing ""I Stand Alone,"" I suspected that Noe was a truly audacious, uncompromising talent worth watching and ""Irreversible"" has surely confirmed this for me. As you may have heard by now, the film is constructed as a series of short episode that are arranged in reverse order that is, we begin with revenge (bloody, visceral, BRUTAL revenge) and work backwards from there. Some might say that this is nothing more than a pretentious gimmick on Noe's part, but given what we gradually learn from the story, it works really well. The notorious rape scene occurs almost exactly at the midpoint of the film, and YES, it is also as brutal as you have been led to believe, but this is not to say it is gratuitious, just very real. Between the non-linear presentation, the swirling camerawork and sound design, ""Irreversible"" has an almost hallucinatory quality right to the very end. Gaspar Noe is a rare talent with a unique cinematic vision, not unlike the Stanley Kubrick he reportedly reveres so much. I'm going to be paying attention to this man's career.",1372464000,,1184,4.780487804878049

1874454,2,B00008YNI2,"This film is yet another example of art house cinema taken to an ultra extreme in the name of art and frankley this sort of movie making is begining to get on my nerves. For the first 30 minuetes of this film the camera literally swirls in circles and takes the audience on a very freightening trip into the realms of sickness and depravity rarely ever experienced in cinema. The film opens as two men search for a violent rapist inside of an extreme gay night club called 'The Rectum'. Just from the name alone I knew this was going to be an extremely disturbing and shocking experience, and boy was it ever. The first half of this film is filled with so much sickness and depravity that you won't believe what your seeing. This is within the limited dizzy camera swirling about in the enviroment that gives the audience a very nightmarish visual gross-out as we see some of the most disturbing footage ever commited to film, including a man who's face is bashed to mush with a fire extinguisher, and it's truly very brutal and realistic. Further on we see the most frank and brutal rape scene ever filmed. It's the most disturbing rape scene ever made and it will shock you with it's careless treatment of rape. This movie shows us what lenghts humans are willing to go to in the name of film, and it's very sick and twisted. The sad thing about this movie is that the person commiting such sickness as horrible beating and anal rape is never found or pays for his crimes. The film shifts dramatically from one completely different style of directing to another more downbeat one and it makes no sense at all. The realism of the rapes and violence is very, very disturbing, so be warned. This is possibly the sickest movie ever made and it's very unsettling. Take my word for that, and skip it if you have any humanity left. This movie is very twisted and horrifying to experience. And it's ugliness makes me weep for the human race.

I get where they were going with it, it was an artistic spin on the title and events of the film, but I don't feel it was right for the story. Other than that, the ""artisitic"" angles and dizzying cameras were downright horrendous. The story itself is even flawed as in there's no build up to the events, and this is especially true with the reverse storytelling. The climax of the film is at the beginning, and then it dwindles down for the rest of the film. I like films that make some kind of sense, and this one didn't. It's the story of a woman, her ex whom she's now friends with, and her current partner. There's items toward the end/beginning that are supposed to disturb us, as in her partner saying how he wants to make love to her in a certain way which resembles the way she was assaulted, and her dream of the red tunnel breaking. But rather it just seems too forced and I just felt it was completely lacking any depth. Rather, it was kind of a ""Reality TV"" look at the events, and even then not compelling whatsoever. The brutal scenes are what everyone has said they are, brutal. But I am left with this film not really saying anything to me. It didn't speak to me. I don't know what the point was.

1874544,4,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible is exactly the type of adult drama that cinema fans in the US must seek outside the borders of our country.  In every way, Irreversible is a film for grown-ups only: the subject matter, the plot, the scenes, the images, the language.  Even today, ten plus year later, it is doubtful that this movie could be made here, with similar stars and quality.

Director Gaspar Noe unabashedly channels Stanley Kubrick and applies a heavy hand to cause a reaction in the audience, especially in the violent scenes.  He uses a wide variety of techniques to do so, and film students may find Irreversible of interest purely from a technical perspective.  Non-film buffs should forget about trying to follow every aspect of the dialogue and scenes, and instead react to the imagery as Noe intends.

One technique that Noe uses is long scenes shot with a single camera, which means the actors must go on and on with their dialogue and acting without benefit of a cut.  This creates quite a challenge, but one that Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel in particular succeed at.  This real-life husband and wife team has an especially long scene in an apartment, conducted mostly in the buff, that provides an incredibly intimate look into the on-screen relationship of their characters.  Another impressive scene is a frank three-way conversation on the Paris Metro with another character about intimate aspects of adult relationships.  These are the sorts of scenes that you just don't see in mainstream US cinema.

Well, I am here to tell you that if you ever watch a Gaspar Noe film then what you are in for is not only shock to the eye, but to the mind, body, and soul. This is not for intended for viewers with a weak stomach, or immaturity,or pure shock value. There is so much more to a Noe film than gore and galore. You will see the same concept with I Stand Alone and Enter the Void, the less violent of his filmography. To the person that said they didn't understand it or was really confused, it's really not. You simply follow the sequences as if they were beginning to end instead of reversed. The point to this is, one simple word, anticipation. This film starts out extremely violent and does not let up at all throughtout the entire film, and everything you think you know, you don't because there's always a surprise waiting in that next chapter. Since everyone has already written a review and has given you the synopsis, then I am not going to give it to you again knowing what you already know now. Just prepare yourself for the real world. It's cruel, evil, nefarious, twisted, and unpreparing. He does not hold back and never glorifies any situation, even the party scene. It was uncomfortable for me, and when they make love. Every scene effects me many different ways. I have hatred for someone ""forcing"" me to watch this, but it's myself that wants to be on the same level as Noe. I will say this, it never ever gets easier to watch. I have probably seen it 15 times hoping I can get through it without closing my eyes and being so enraged that I can't do anything to help. It's an experience you will never forget but do not mistake this film for it's taboo subject matters. There is an actual point to it and if you can't figure it out, than Noe's films are not for you.

1874564,1,B00008YNI2,"The synopsis of this movie should warn viewers that it contains violent scenes of murder,rape, & assault!!! I can appreciate the different camera shots, but beginning with the opening credits the director just had too many & too extended length of these weird music cues and camera angles. That was more annoying than creative.

I have never witnessed such a brutal attack & murder, Tena deserved it, but it was sickeniing to watch. As far as the rape scene it always the tried & true victimization of a woman. According to the beginning scenes & the Tena'smsexual preference it should have been a male victim, but no one will show that except for HBO's Oz. This film was more brutal than 9MM. Like 9MM, it appears to be a rouse for sexual deviants to feel free to enjoy a film in the open, instead of hiding in their basements to watch it!!

What was the purpose of the two men talking in the bedroom flat, because it added nothing to the movie, but in hind-sight i wonder about the mentality of the director for seemingly excusing child molestation, another victimization of a female.

Honestly, I do wonder about the mental state of the director & writers because of the brutality of this film. Based on this film I am not interested in watching any more of his films. I have seen more creative work from graduate film students.",1355443200,2,1331,4.584033613445378

The movie was listed with one underrated warning, which was definitely not enough... when I read the warning, I figured, no big deal, I can fast forward through that one scene.  However, there were a couple different horrific scenes where you needed to fast forward through a total of at least 20-30 minutes of film.
For example, if you think that watching 15 minutes of a violent rape up a girl's butt while she screams, followed by her head getting smashed in, is entertainment, then you need your head checked.  Trash like this gives crazy people ideas.  It also desensitizes viewers to extreme violence.  The writers/directors should be investigated.  This movie makes a very strong case for censorship.

1874605,1,B00008YNI2,"I read many of the reviews of this film (both for and against) before I decided to view it myself. I watch a movie in the hope that it has some degree of entertainment value.  Sometimes I am well entertained and others not quite so much.  Unfortunately, this movie fell into the latter category. If I have to struggle for comprehension of the story line then I am not being entertained.  Sure there was a bit of gratuitous sex and a bit of violence all portrayed in very graphic form but for what purpose?  The camera work looked like something produced by someone who had indulged in the use of an halucinogenic drug.  Perhaps if I had been using the same, it may have made some sense.  Obviously, films of this type will appeal to a small niche group who could probably see the beauty in the leaves on a tree in a forest during a 100 mile per hour hurricane.  For those who consider this film(and others like it) as entertainment, fine, but sadly it's not for me.

1874626,5,B00008YNI2,"I hated this film and stopped it a number of times. I think I watched it twice in full.  This is not because the film is poorly made, but simply - as art, Noe delves under your skin, purposefully, and starts needling around your body.  This film is brutal, and the first few moments are frenetic, disorienting, and disturbing enough that, if you got through those, the rest of the film should be relatively manageable until the profoundly disturbing 12 minute still shot in the subway alley.

I doubt I could watch it again.  It's likely the most disturbing film I have ever seen.... along the lines of Men Behind the Sun, August Underground, and the like.

I think the most profoundly disturbing thing is that 90% miss the point, and without spoilers, after the opening scene with the two guys in the upstairs apartment... make sure to listen to what the guy says to the person being taken out on the stretcher, next to the club.  When I realized what was going on, the raw emotion that was elicited made me realize how expertly Noe crafted his narrative.  It's definitely a bit of an homage to Kubrick's the Killing with the storyline, but it's more like a Memento crossed with Pulp Fiction, then cross it with the most profoundly paralyzing and disturbing story you can remember.

I don't like being made uncomfortable, but I am a big fan of film as art, and something transformative that isn't always pleasant.  Art isn't just about enjoying something, but it's about recognizing and pondering your reaction to it.

This film is not pleasant. Noe could be considered a mysoginistic pornographer.  But this film, certainly, is art... and it would be a mistake for anyone that considers themselves a lover of film to not watch it for what it is.",1351641600,,1747,4.657980456026059
1874627,5,B00008YNI2,"For all of those who have said that this film goes too far and shows too much:  Congratulations, you are human beings with a working conscience.  Unfortunately, stories similar to this play out in real life every day, I think the thing that is most disturbing is the break from what we expect in cinema.  When we watch a movie we want an escape from reality.  We want something that could never really happen or is so over-dramatized that we can use it to escape our world.  This film shoves  one hour and forty minutes of reality down your throat and offers no escape other than the stop button.

From a film making stance: This piece of art is genius in its purest form.  Sure, it borrows some style points here and there, like the reverse storytelling similar to Memento, but it is used in such a way that I was glued to the screen.
Another point of directorial glory is the camera and editing work.  Almost all the way through, there is not a single discernible cut or fade transition and really makes it seem as though the entire film is done in one long take.

One reviewer recommended watching this film alone.  I agree, the emotion and raw humanity at its worst and best are not exactly date night material.  Plus, there is subject matter that in order to truly experience it, you must be free from the emotional influence of others.
The title of this film is such an fitting metaphor,aside from the obvious reasons, you will never be the same. You do not just watch this film, you experience it!",1351641600,,1504,4.4489051094890515

Its unfortunate that the brutality that Irreversible depicts actually exists in the world. I am of the opinion that even staged violence in someway violates the people who are watching the film. This film proves this as well as the truth of its title. The violence doesn't stop no matter which direction in time we are moving. There are many forms of violence in this film besides the horrific physical violence it depicts. There is the sex trade, indifference to one's friends, the ongoing berating and shouting between most of the characters. Within the genre of documentary film making there is a principle that views the very act of making the recordings as a kind of rape. The semi documentary feel of Irreversible brings this sense of constant violation home to anyone who sees this film. I feel that the outcome of viewing this film is that I realize yet again that there is a very thin veil that separates the apparent peace and ease of our lives from the most heinous acts of which human beings are capable. The difficulty we all face is that, like the protagonist in this film, there is nothing really to be done about any of it in retrospect.

1874658,1,B00008YNI2,"This ""Film"" is a waste of talent, time and space.

The beginning has a scene that is so graphic and disturbing and goes on WAYYYYYY too long. NOBODY NEEDS TO SEE THAT. As Americans we are used to ""Hollywood"" violence and we know it's fake and we are desensitized to it. This scene can literally give (even an adult) jarring nightmares for a very long time. Someone should have edited that but thought ""Hey, wouldn't it be totally gross if we left it in?"" Whoever made THAT decision should never be allowed near a camera again. That's all I'll say about that.

The beautiful Monica what can I say about her....OH, bad career choice. It's too bad cause she was hot in the only watchable 5-6 minute scene.
Clearly the director has some sort of ""Rape"" fetish and that's ok because you know the rape is not real. This scene was sooooo unrealistic in the sense that it would not have gone on as long as it did. How do I know? As a rape victim. He would have been in and out and gone. That was just ridiculous.

I didn't even read the summary prior to watching! So the opening comes out being straight up weird and was just a spinning camera flying around almost giving me motion sickness. Actually debated whether to stop watching. Thankfully, I didn't. As the spinning camera style does start to slow down while the movie progresses. The kooky scene with the old man also ends rather quickly. And then comes the fire extinguisher scene. The fire extinguisher scene was incredibly realistic. Almost too realistic. And the movie is just as twisted the longer it goes. So hang in there!

So, the story of the film is shown in reverse order. Personally, I liked it that way as seeing how these events come to form really forces you to pay attention and link all the who's, what's, where's, etc... together. And as the story shapes up, the details start to reveal a far more normal picture than you would have originally thought. That is what makes this movie so brutal. The beginning pieces. After the ending (or beginning?) has been realized, this is the point that really hits close to home.

So I am an avid horror/thriller/B-movie watcher and I wasn't as broken up over the movie as some reviewers. So if you are someone who had trouble making it through a movie like HOSTEL, you will most definately have trouble watching this movie.

And it is indeed a hard watch-probably more so if you're not aware of what's going to happen. The way the film is structured, you know the scene is coming next, but you're still not prepared for a very brutal depiction of what happens. The end is a bit confusing as far as the overall timeline. I disagree with the Wikipedia entry, and think the final two scenes happen after the rest of the movie, but that's just my unproven opinion.

Sometimes I wanted the scene to be over because of how extreme it was- some scenes may feel like they last forever because of this. It really shows us how sick some people can be for no particular reason at all; these sick actions are shows so vividly as well. The movie has unique storytelling since it's told in reverse; only a few movies have been able to do this successfully, and this is one of them. The acting was also great, Vincent Cassel being a standout. It's a very solid thriller/drama, but it's not for the sensitive or squeamish. One complaint I had was the camerawork in the first half of the film; the camera spins around uncontrollably way too often, it spins multiple times and feels like it's just being thrown around. Eventually, it controls itself.

Irreversible is recommended, but be sure you know what you're getting into. As of 8/14/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.

It is hard to categorize this film because it definitely has in its first 40 to 50 minutes elements of a horror film. The ominous siren wail when the two main characters are trying to find a very sick individual, a few scenes of extreme violence and the shocking conclusion. To me though I think the film really is a drama, well a psycho human drama but I will leave that one up to the viewer because this film is very hard to place in a category. I must say though that there are only a few films that shock me and they are all mostly horror films. This is the first film that is not horror to me that after viewing felt like a sledgehammer to the face. Gaspar Noe's other films do not even come close to the fierce realism of this one. It is a brutal and honest yet disturbing look at human actions and reactions. This film is not for children and I do not care if as a parent you let them view gory horror films. Do not let innocent eyes grace the screen while this one is on. The film has some extreme shots of homosexual men doing they're thing so that alone should make it an adult film only, not to mention the the few scenes of gruesome violence. But the rape scene is the worst rape ever to grace a scene. Especially after the first viewing but it seems to never get any easier with additional screenings. Noe is a genius filmmaker just for the camerawork in his films not to mention the storylines his films deal with. They take a viewer where they have never been before (hopefully) and that is the find of directors we need to see more of these days. Wish Noe would make more films, because any film he would make would be a great film I know. After viewing this film my jaw was slacked for hours, and I thought of the film the whole night when I was trying to sleep. A film that does that to me is in my opinion real art.

I found the movie to be very interesting.  As for the violence, I've seen more graphic violence on the television shows CSI and Law & Order.

One person stated that they purchased the movie and was upset about the graphic violent rape scenes.  Right on the front of the case it states that there are violent and graphic scenes and if you had read the synopsis you would have been forewarned.

Also, I find it amusing that you want to watch movies that depict violence but you want storybook violence.

I have news for you.  RAPE IS VIOLENT!! with or without any additional physical abuse.

This a foreign film.  Europe does not sugarcoat or romanticize violence like American films.

Fifty-two years ago Sophia Loren stared in a movie (Two Women) where a mother and teenage daughter were brutally raped by a group of soldiers.  The movie won an Oscar and was nominated in two other categories.
No one whined about it because back then if a movie offended a person they just didn't watch it.

Now all the hypocrites trying to be politically correct want the studios to produce movies that depict violence unrealistically.

""Irreversible"" is a hodge podge of visual images that attempts to turn rape and revenge into artistic cinematic statements. It doesn't have much of a  plot and there is no character development.

Another feature of the film that made me almost seasick from the start was the camera technique of swirling the camera around and tilting it different directions. I guess if one is high on acid, this makes sense?

This review is my own personal opinion and I don't expect anyone to be impressed, only hope to help some folks avoid wasting their money on a worthless movie.

The essence of the film is gratuitous violence and sex. I rented this simply because it was ""recommended"" by Amazon's upselling and because some others rated it well. I thought I would be open-minded and watch it as I have with some other foreign films. The camera just continues to move in a dizzying fashion the whole time and the sound track does the same. This is presumably supposed to disorient us, possibly in an attempt to cover up the lack of true creativity in this film. Plot? First man loves a woman; woman gets raped by a second, morally repugnant man; first man seeks out second man and first man's friend smashes second man's face in with a fire extinguisher. I have honestly seen productions by high school students that are better than this especially in terms of cinematography. Moving a camera back and forth and showing glimpses of signs, walls on an angle, etc. does NOT make good art! This reminds me of one of those art exhibits where the artist has some ""abstract"" showing that makes sense to absolutely no one with an ounce of reasoning but you invariably get some individuals there who gush for it; because it is simply different. I could literally walk down some really bad parts of certain cities, while drunk and see this type of material (and I have).  The big question is why would I ever want to? If you are looking for a film which will make you think or entertain you, or demonstrate some some artistic avenue you have not explored then look elsewhere.

1874713,2,B00008YNI2,"I was curious enough to watch this movie even though I had reservations, since I am so easily affected and bothered by viewing violence. I went ahead anyway when I read the reviews comparing it to Memento, which I really liked. I am very fond of movies that I can't figure out the first time, and the idea of a reversed order of sequences from end to beginning appealed to me on this one despite the subject matter of violent rape, and revenge. The spinning camera effects sounded interesting. I like experimental and artistic films, and am particularly fond of French films.

The movie starts out with very dizzying type spinning camera rotations and angles, often focusing up at the ceiling in a dark cavernous space. The camera twirls while it also follows two men running through various winding rooms, up and down stairs in a huge S&M club for gay men called ""The Rectum"". The two men are highly agitated, since they are looking for the man who raped and beat a woman they both love. This is some very novel and experimental footage. It's why I am even giving it two stars.

The biggest problem I had with it, is that I thought the depictions of violence were oddly distancing. I did not end up caring about any of the characters. I wasn't even particularly bothered by the beginning of the film which starts with a murder scene. One of the main characters ends up smashing a guys head in with a fire extinguisher. It almost looks like he's smashing a pumpkin. I thought, hey, he should have stopped after two blows, because he just needed to disable him. If he murders the guy, then several lives will be ruined. That's all that went through my mind, and usually I am upset if there is something as minor as a scraped knee. Someone else stated in their review that it was because the spinning was so distracting and dizzying that it took away our ability to make a moral judgment. I hope that's why I had the reaction that I did...I ended up feeling disturbed that I didn't feel much of anything, or care about the characters. My take on the movie is that the director, and probably the writer, were enjoying the depictions of violence. The name of the movie should be IRRESPONSIBLE instead of Irreversible.

Also,I was very distracted by the way the woman character was dressed. I kept wondering how she could go out of the house wearing those particular party clothes. I puzzled about whether her slip dress was designed with a certain kind of seam, so that it looked like she was excited and her nipples were constantly standing at attention. The cover of the movie focuses on this. You wonder if the actress is clothed or naked, or sports a farmers tan. I know how she was dressed had nothing to do with her rape, but I kept wondering how she go out looking so vulnerable, and why the people at the party she attended didn't seem to notice. In the United States men would definitely be fixated on her chest.

There is hardly any character development in this movie. When there is dialogue it all seems to have to do with sex, or characters are screaming almost incoherently, and threatening other people. The whole movie is gratuitous sex and violence. I didn't come away with any ""wow"" that affected me kind of feeling. I think rape is a detestable and hideous crime, but the rape scene didn't bother me at all even though it went on for 10 minutes. I was disturbed by the brutality of what happened immediately afterward, but in a very dispassionate kind of way. None of it seemed real to me, even though I think the actors did a good job. Maybe all the erratically moving camera angles and footage was just too disorienting, or maybe it's because everything happened out of sequence.

This one's not for you. If you're easily prone to depression then don't even think about it. Told in a non-linear narrative, the film tells the unnerving story of a viscous sex assault of a beautiful woman (Bellucci) by a sadistic pimp in a pedestrian underpass and the two men (Cassel, Dupontel) out to avenge the act. Noe does not shy away from using dizzying and swirling camera work that might get some people a little bit nauseous, but I think it adds to the intensity in a sick sorta way, especially during one notorious scene in an underground gay asylum in the bowels of Paris involving a fire extinguisher. The film also contains one of the longest and most brutal rape scenes ever put on film, and nobody can deny the gorgeous Bellucci was indeed brave for a realistic and heartbreaking performance that so many other actresses would never have even considered. When it premiered in France in May 2002, it is said audience reactions to both the rape and fire extinguisher scenes ""have ranged from appreciation of their artistic merits to leaving the theater in disgust..."". Take it for what it's worth and come up with your own conclusions of the morals of the plot, but don't expect your run-of-the-mill Hollywood junk.

My wife and I barely lasted through this part, although as the movie goes along, the camerawork begins to settle down.  That's the only reason we managed to suffer through the first part of the movie.  The rest of the film is steadier, and almost excellent.

The story is told backwards, and (probably) would only have had impact had it been done this way.  Dialogue minimalistic, but OK, since in French and must read subtitles.  Thing is, the dialogue is essential to the overall meaning of the film, so you do have to keep up with it.  By the end of the film, I was wondering how much credit Amazon would give for trading it in (only about $4).

Next morning, voila!  So that's what's going on!  Wait a minute, so that's how all of this pieces together?  And that's why the movie is titled ""Irreversible""!  Incroyable!  I gotta watch this again!  There is a lot of significance in the later scenes of the film (which, of course, in the context of the story, happened before the events in the beginning of the film).  This is not just another T&A, slice-and-dice, bloodfest, but is actually telling us something significant.

The movie is extremely brutal, and graphically sexual.  It is disconcerting, because the scenes are being shown in reverse (along the lines of ""Memento""), but do not overlap in content or context the way ""Memento"" does.  And that is significant as far as the title is concerned.  But this movie actually makes you think, once the initial shock value (which is rather substantial) wears off.  That's not to say I won't ultimately trade this one in, but only after I've watched it at least one more time.

1874728,1,B00008YNI2,"*Contains Spoilers*

Irreversible is THE most unabashedly homophobic movie I've ever encountered and certainly one of the most smugly pretentious and ultimately vacuous (unless one counts vehement mean-spiritedness as legitimate content). A beautiful, idealized trophy woman walks down an alley, gets viciously anal-raped and killed by a random evil gay/bisexual man for 10 minutes, and he wantonly scampers off to an underground gay S&M club called ""The Rectum"" where gay men are acting depraved and insane (while the camera twirls around to purposefully make the audience sick).

Then the woman's righteous straight boyfriend screams his way to the club where he bashes the perceived murderer in the head with a *fire extinguisher* over and over until the evil gay man becomes a corpse with his skeleton exposed, all while the animalistic gay men stare blankly and/or masturbate to the murder like deranged non-humans.

Then, the story goes backwards to illustrate how they were a happy couple who had heavenly heterosexual sex (unlike what would ever happen between gay men at ""The Rectum"") and were even expecting a beautiful child, since their sex created life and not just, according to the Director's apparently Nazi Republican, Victorian-Era Conservative viewpoint, unbridled feces and mindless depravity.

And then that's it. You see, I don't even really have to unpack subtle cues of heterosexual chauvinism because it doesn't really get more blatant than that. Heterosexual=Heaven and Life! Homosexual=Hell and Death! I suppose a lot of religious fundamentalist conservatives would love what this movie is trying to perpetuate, but I don't think they usually watch movies this graphic.

So that I can give an opinion about this Argentine filmmaker, who has established something like the enfant terrible of France.

His films are explicitly violent, with a morbid incisiveness that reverberates in our psyche because of the frenetic pace and the excessive use of a dizzying array of images accompanied by a deafening sounds to achieve a gloom bordering on the unbearable.

My problem with this movie is that it is a visual exercise, an effect that is nourished by a stunning and heartbreaking beginning to tell us in strict chronological order from the end towards the beginning, a resource that was used by Christopher Nolan, just two years ago with Memento.

The main problem revolves around the script itself, since the specific gravity of the film lies in the first thirty minutes. Then he sees a visible depletion of narrative rhythm to tell the scenes of a relationship where there is some humor, a lot of bombast but short on substance.

That is why the film suffers from the last sixty minutes. And not the very presence of the sultry Monica Bellucci and even manages to convey a foreboding atmosphere of what is to happen.

From this film Gaspar Noelogro bring greater coherence to his next two jobs as I stand alone (his most successful, in my view) and enter the void where he moved to Japan.

My dear reader, if you look closely you can see how the elder of the opening sequence, is somehow indicating the drama I stand alone, which seems to suggest that it is a trilogy by this talented director.",1316908800,,1695,4.614617940199335

1874756,3,B00008YNI2,"Bottom line is that the events and harrowing images presented in `Irreversible' are just that, completely irreversible.  You will not be able to shake the imagery, and so for those of you who do not wish to subject yourself to senseless and gut wrenching acts of violence and rape, please excuse yourself from this page and consider watching a different movie.  That isn't to say that those who watch this film are watching it because they enjoy those things (I hope that NO ONE particularly `enjoys' this film) but for those of us who embrace the ideals behind cinematic expression, `Irreversible' is a film that we want to see, at least once, in order to appreciate the directorial vision and actorly bravado.

In other words; if you watch films solely for entertainment purposes, WALK AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE.

I'll just yell minor spoilers here so no one gets upset, although I can't really accept that these are spoilers since the main topic of discussion with regard to this film is the events I'll relay in the following, and they really are things every viewer should know BEFORE going in because these are not surprises you want to encounter when watching a film; trust me.

`Irreversible' is told in counter-chronological order; starting at the very end of this tragic tale and working its way backwards to the tender beginnings.  Opening with disturbing depictions of rampant sex as the two main characters weave their way through a claustrophobic gay-club in search of a man responsible for an outlandish atrocity; `Irreversible' immediately starts to live up to its name.  When twenty minutes of absurd camera angles and dimly lit sexual encounters ends with one of the most disturbing murders I've seen on film, I was beginning to wonder if this was going to really be worth my cinematic `interest'.  As the clock ticked backwards, another gross act of violence took place; that being the now nearly legendary rape scene that clocks in at nine minutes and is, quite honestly, one of the most disturbing sequences I've seen put to film.  In fact, my cinematic curiosities were not enough to keep my eyes open and I missed a good chunk of it because I didn't want to watch...I just couldn't.

So, with two horrific images lodged in my brain for all time; was this venture worth it?  Yes and no.  From a visionary standpoint, the film has its highlights, but for the most part I found it slightly underdeveloped.  The script was never really complete; nothing more than a basic idea, and that was admitted by the film's director.  The dialog was largely adlibbed, but that really wasn't the issue, especially since the lack of direct dialog added to the more panicked and natural state of the characters.  The main issue I have with what director Gaspar Noe did here is that he played too heavily on gimmick to create an emotional response that felt forced and manipulative in the end.

I am not opposed to irony, but `Irreversible' was not a film that NEEDED that to succeed.  In fact, the irony of the film's ending (and the dialog that surrounded some of the preposterous `premonitions') took away from the power of the film's core.

But, one thing that `Irreversible' has in spades is powerful performances, and they really don't get any better than this.  In all honesty, Monica Bellucci delivers what may be the best supporting performance of the aughts here.  She slips so far beneath the skin of Alex that you feel her every crippling emotion.  While the rape scene is horrific to watch, the aftermath is even more disturbing because it feels so raw.  Just look at her hands; the panicked way she beats them against the ground.  You can feel her pain in your gut.  Vincent Cassell is also fantastic here; delivering a fiery performance for the film's first (or should I say last) half and then switching gears for a charmingly immature take on a playboy.  Albert Dupontel is also superb here.

The acting is the film's largest saving grace, for it injects so much humanity into the film's masochistic core.

At the end of the day, I feel as though I can't really recommend this film.  Gaspar Noe went out of his way to disgust and repulse the audience that he lost something key in the process.  `Irreversible' becomes almost too consumed with its own horrors to deliver something that feels truly important.  Instead it feels merely stylized and self-absorbed.  The film's conclusion is too prophetic (especially the conversation between Alex and Marcus while lounging around their apartment naked) for it to be taken seriously, and that is probably where the film's construction is the biggest downfall.  Had that conversation taken place on the outset of the film then maybe the eventualities of the evening would have delivered a more severe blow, but having the conversation take place AFTER we witness the atrocities of the evening almost make the dialog feel foolish and insulting; like the whole film is a joke.

If that makes any sense.

I understand the idea behind the reverse-chronological delivery being akin to the film's title, taking a stab at the idea of `reversing' the worst night of their lives, but the script and the film's construction are not balanced here.  One cannot work with the other and so something had to change to make this film what it needed to be.",1310083200,3,5300,4.799559471365638

1874758,1,B00008YNI2,"Ugly, mean-spirited, misogynistic, homophobic, simple-minded movie that assails the audience with violence and adolescent hate fantasies and cheap gimmicks, while posing as art. The movie revolves around two things: a sadistic rape that is basically torture porn, and a gay-bashing revenge fantasy that is a release for those who hate gays and want to see them smashed into a bloody pulp. Other than that, there is no content. The first twenty or thirty minutes has the camera whirling around constantly, so that it will produce severe motion sickness in most. Whereas writers used to use great acting, writing, set design, staging and so forth to create changes in the audience such as catharsis, now I suppose a physiological change, from physically well to physically ill, passes for a state change or catharsis. (Motion sickness rather than emotion sickness). This is why it's basically a porn film. It's designed to work only on physiological responses, to produce a ""violence erection."" The telling of the story in reverse produces the same effect, that is, to so utterly disorient the audience that it can't follow the story and is forced to rely only on its physiological responses. As such it's the very lowest form of entertainment.",1309824000,4,1242,5.123152709359606

The emotions portrayed and evoked are understandable and palpable. If you can not stomach the dark side of human behavior, however, this film is not for you. It has an intensely graphic rape scene that, while containing little nudity, is simply brutal.",1304294400,,614,4.747663551401869

I had not expected to endure inaudible low-frequency sound, gutwrenching camera movements, surprisingly transcendent and memorable acting performances, an ending (or beginning??) twist that would normally be cliched and unoriginal yet seems powerfully sad, and a final Strobe lightshow that brings the film's powerful message (Time Destroys Everything) full circle. Notable for its masterful cinematography (particularly in the ""Rectum"" scene), mindblowing soundtrack (the final piece of classical music was really effective) and an intriguing slow pace that surprisingly works. As for the reverse chronology, I think it makes the film much more effective, and changes it from graphic and gratuitous torture-porn to meaningful and satisfactory revenge flick. If the film had been in chronological order, there would have been very less special about it. But Noe's idea of having the viewer watch the end first, and then be subjected to a final thirty minutes of the characters happy and enjoying themselves, being powerless to warn them or help them, makes it all the more scary and memorable. A masterpiece of French cinema.",1297814400,7,1239,5.458333333333333
1874762,4,B00008YNI2,"One of my favorite directors of all time and one of my favorite movies. ""Irreversible"" is an experience unlike any other. Gaspar Noe uses reverse-chronological story telling to give us one of the most visceral and frightening encounters you are ever likely to have in the Cinema. The film is beautifully shot and intensely acted. ""Irreversible"" is Noe's first use of the floating camera technique that he also used in the 2009 film ""Enter The Void"", another roller-coaster of a film. Not surprisingly, this film is not for everyone. It is widely known as one of the most difficult movies to watch due to the graphic violence and long rape scene so be warned. But it is not just a shock film, it has an important message about relationships and how the decisions we make ultimately decide our fate.

The story involves a couple played by Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel who after a heated argument split ways for the evening. Alex, played by Bellucci, gets fed up with her boyfriend Marcus (Cassel) and leaves the safety of her friends to go home. A decision we eventually find out is a near fatal one. Marcus finds out that his love has been brutally raped and beaten on her way home. This sends him into a rage of revenge and he will not stop until he finds the one responsible. Along the way Marcus' best friend and Alex's former lover tries to convince him to leave it be so he won't do something he will regret. As you can imagine, he is unsuccessful.

""Irreversible"" starts at the end of the story and ends at the beginning, much like the movie ""Memento"" by Christopher Nolan. A decision that could have gone either way. Most people like the reverse story telling, I think it could have gone either way. Gaspar Noe is known to push the limits and make his audience as uncomfortable as he can by graphically presenting topics that are hard to witness and think about. In this outing he decides to hit you with the heaviest scenes in the beginning and middle of the movie then ending with the character development. Thankfully, the third act was designed to slowly bring the audience back from the horror they have just seen. By the end you have (slightly) come to terms with the earlier terror and you are left with an array of emotions.

The production team Noe surrounds himself with are some of the best in the business. ""Irreversible"" is a marvel of film making using dreary soundtracks and showcasing the seedy underbelly of France. As mentioned before the use of the floating camera is outstanding; a major challenge since it was filmed using cables suspended in the air. It's as if you are on a ride, one that you want to get off but can't; the ultimate ""fly on the wall"" experience.

""Irreversible"" was filmed with a loose script and literally no dialogue. In fact, the infamous rape scene was essentially free-form by Bellucci and La Tenia, the antagonist played by Jo Prestia. Gaspar used one long take from a fixed camera to film this scene which made a huge impact. It caused the viewer to believe they are witnessing an actual rape on camera. It truly is the most difficult scene I have ever witnessed. Many people walked out due to this scene during the premier, cursing the director. Noe, however, loves to get these reactions as it shows his goal to push the boundaries was successful. Cassel and Bellucci have amazing chemistry (it helps they are actually married). Bellucci is as beautiful as ever and Cassel presents an intensity rarely seen from actors. I think having his wife presented with such a horrific experience pushed him further. Pretty much all of the other characters were cast with unknowns or people that haven't acted at all which pushed the realism.

It has been over a year since my first viewing of this film and I still think about it. ""Irreversible"" is not a film that can easily be watched over and over and probably shouldn't be. Afterward you feel drained, angry, sad and confused. Confused because you aren't sure whether you just watched one of the worst or best films ever made. If you are up for the challenge, I highly recommend giving this a shot, but be warned it's not for the faint of heart.

The only times the camera was still was during the rape scene and the face smashing scene....yeah cuz thats what we want to see right? (sarcasm)

The movie does start from ending to beginning, which is dumb in my opinion, because it doesn't raise any emotions(except for confusion) After the rape scene you want to see that guy get bashed in, but you already saw it so the pleasure of seeing him get hurt was ruined.

This guy had brutally raped his girlfriend at a subway station. The rape was long about 9 minutes and was not erotic in any form. It showed the horrors of this crime. This film did a great job of creating this story backwards. I would recommend it to everyone that enjoys movies that are well constructed.

1874786,2,B00008YNI2,"If the purpose of this movie is to make the viewer uncomfortable, then, congrats, mission accomplished.  The problem with this, of course, is that ipecac, roller coasters, and soiled baby diapers do the same thing.

Warning:
If you are prone to motion sickness, have vertigo or epilepsy, or got ill when watching the camera work in Cloverfield, then you probably shouldn't watch this movie.  Because it's far worse.  Ten times worse.  And at times even amateur.

Having said all that, this is nothing more than the typical rape-revenge tale, but told backwards like Memento.  I'm not completely opposed to the rape-revenge genre; it's often entertaining to cheer on the revenge aspect.  There is even a decent performance turned in by Vincent Cassel (The Messenger, Eastern Promises) as the enraged boyfriend of Monica Belluci.  Kudos to her as well; she endured what has to be the longest, most realistic, and most brutal rape scene in movie history.  It makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-House-on-the-Left/dp/B002DKGWSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last House on the Left</a>&nbsp;seem like a date movie.  The graphic brutality of the eventual revenge - a completely barbaric and primal display of raw emotion displaying the fire extinguisher's density advantages over the human facial bones - is almost too realistic.  To make matters worse, the movie eventually removes all the morbid gratification of the revenge - the one justifiable reason for watching movies of this genre.

All of that, however, does not make up for a weak script, the pointless and color-blind camerawork, and needlessly long, uninterrupted scenes and front-loaded significant content that makes the 97 minute running time feel MUCH longer.  This is pretentious, pseudo-intellectual art-house nonsense; it lacks insight and has no actual resolution.

At one point a primary character, Pierre, says of another's actions, ""F--- B-movie revenge crap.""  That pretty much sums it up.  It may be trite, but watching this movie is irreversible.

As for the Rectum, the search for Le Tenia just took too damn long, followed by the extensive head bashing. VERY frustrating for me, as I did enjoy the film but wish it could be re-edited.

 The acting is top notch, even if you have to read some sub-titles. I have never found subtitles to be distracting, but if they were it is hard to pull your eyes from the screen. Even when you should because what you are seeing is one of the most heinous acts on film that I have ever seen, you simply can not. Irreversible draws you in from the very first scene, or the last scene if you want to be cute.

  From a film making aspect there is nothing else like Irreversible;a  film that runs backwards. Saying it and reading about it is one thing, but to get the full affect you have to watch the movie. It's not like Quentin Tarantino's played out ""Let's jumble the movie scenes around."" The director,Gaspar No, had a reason to show the film backwards. This is not to say that Tarantino didn't when he shot Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction chop suey style. However, Tarantino has gone to that well one to many times and it has just gotten old over time. By showing the film backwards No has given a bow to the title, but the themes are stressed even more than if he had shot a straight, chronological movie. A straight forward movie would not have had the same impact on the viewer. As it, you can't help to be a little shaken at the end of the film. It definitely stays with you.

With that said, I have to confess that the first time I watched this movie was about 5 years ago. I went into the movie ""UNKNOWING"" about what was to occur. At that time I had recently just become an admirer of MONICA BELLUCCI and VINCENT CASSEL. So as you can imagine I was ""Offended"" at the controversial scene. (Keep in mind, at the time I had heard nothing about this movie so I didn't know that scene was coming.)

It took me 5 years to get up the courage to watch the movie again. Why did I watch the movie again? The answer is simple; I gained a whole new appreciation for foreign films, foreign actors, as well as underrated cinematography. Plus I have met just too many people who talk about ""freedom of expression"" through Music & Movies, YET those same people will be the FIRST to oppose sexual content in a movie.

I think movies like this film, KIDS, LUST CAUTION, BROKE BACK MOUNTAIN, and other films with ""Controversial"" material should always be seen. But most people don't watch movies to ""Appreciate"" them. Unfortunately they watch movies to take their mind away from the daily B.S. of life. So instead people usually watched dumbed-down flicks like DUDE WHERE'S MY CAR just to pass the time and thus they don't have to THINK.

Either way, I found this movie to be entertaining. But it is interesting for only 1 viewing. I tried to find value in the cinema techniques and of course it was nice seeing how real life husband and wife Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel continue to make movies together.

Is this a good family film to watch during Thanksgiving Dinner? ABSOLUTELY NOT. HECK NO!

Is this a decent movie worth watching during Valentines Day with your boyfriend/girlfriend?  PROBABLY NOT (Trust me on that)

Is it worth checking out due to it's controversy & having a place in cinematic history? YES - But be warned that if you can't handle the dark side of the most devious parts of human behavior then you will be greatly offended and disturbed.

There's your steretypical animal like character, your stereotypical character that overthinks things, and a female who represents a balance of the two.

If the movie had started from the end and gone back to the beginning, then you would see it as a rape revenge piece.  But the way the movie was shot you're thrown right into the action, great.  But there's a lot of confusing dialogue throwing you off as to what's going on.  The depiction of homosexuals in these scenes is that they're just a bunch of perverted monkeys looking to hump each other at all times.  Then as you go back through the story, the action is less and less until finally there are entire scenes of filler between the three characters.

I was looking forward to a good artistic piece, and so many people had raved about it, I thought I'd try.  Then again, some people get excited by watching some really brutal scenes of rape and murder.  (The rape scene is over 10 minutes long, and the murder scene is a painful 2 minutes.)  These scenes are shocking, make no mistake.  But the film just seems to fall flat, and so do the characters.",1265587200,4,1241,4.515695067264574

1874842,4,B00008YNI2,"Remember watching the imfamous flogging scene and thinking: ""Hmm, this couldv'e been about seven minutes shorter.""?  That pretty much applies here.  Granted, I understand and even applaud Gaspar's decision to expose the ugliness of rape and revenge, but there is a such thing as overstating your case.  Make no mistake, this is not PORN.  Alex doesn't resist her attacker in the beginning, only to change her mind the middle, and then have a screeching orgasm at the end.  No, this is more like OZ.  It's brutal, animal and sadistic.

In fact, this movie's first act is so jarring with it's graphic (and in most cases DEVIANT) depictions of sex and violence, it can leave you with a dizzying sense of vertigo.  I think that was the idea behind the spinning camera at the beginning; which is another technique that was overdone.  I think this was to prepare you for the goings-on in the Rectum nightclub.  As if the name itself wasn't an indication!

Now for me, the saving grace of this film is the second half.  It's just...wonderfully done.  I'm sure by now you've read the many reviews that tells you the film is being shown in reverse order.  With that in mind, you have this image of such horrible violence, and yet it's tempered by these three characters that jump out at you.  They're not the victims or beserkers that you see at the film's opening.  They're just regular thirty-something people out having a night on the town.  As the film draws you closer to the end (well, beginning), you almost ALMOST forget what's about to happen.

I was very impressed by the format and storytelling here, and that's the main reason I gave it four stars.  I've never seen this done before, and was surprised at how well it worked. I don't think this was an exploitation peice (although it really did straddle the fence there).  I think it was just three good people that suffered a horrible misfortune and reacted to it in a very believable way.  I think it's important enough for a single viewing, but I wouldn't recommend it for your collection.  It's REALLY brutal.  Enjoy and Be warned.",1259366400,2,2087,4.673076923076923

I only wish I could speak French so I didn't have to take my eyes off the screen to read the subtitles. The Backward time edit is really efective, but takes a few scenes to set in. The fire extinguisher scene is supremely gruesom, very realistic, and horrifyingly disturbing. And not a second of CGI I might add. Monica Belluci is beautiful as always, and gives a terrific performance. The fact that the tunnel scene ( as all others ) is one continuous cut, proves that the director was interested in the utmost realism, and He delivers. Be warned however that this is not a movie for youngsters or someone who would be easily offended, there are scenes of full frontal male nudity, erect penises, and more pelvic thrusts than a Ron Jeremy movie.

1874858,1,B00008YNI2,"The first thing that annoyed me about this movie was the cinematography.  I understand they were trying to invoke a reaction in the audience, but I don't think motion sickness was it.  The camera rolls and rotates all over for extended periods of time in the beginning of the movie (which is actually the end since it was edited in reverse) and again when the scene transitions to the previous event in time.
The second was content.  This movie is Sick with a capital S.  The search for Monica Belucci's character's rapist ends with her ex bashing the head of a gay guy (the wrong one, mind you - the rapist, this guy's friend, stands there smiling) to a pulp with a fire extinguisher, and it's depicted as if it's something fantastic. SICK.  This all takes place in a gay ""club"" called ""the rectum"" in which they had to expose the audience to the sickest, nastiest behavior on the planet all while rolling the camera through three dimensions, and playing a repetitive sickening tune.
The rape scene is brutal and absolutely Sickening.  No woman should have to experience anything like this.  I have to ask why it was glorified in this movie (everything builds up to this moment instead of the other way around).  It doesn't end with the sexual assault, after raping her the rapist lays there remarking how fantastic he thought it was, and when she slowly retreats he kicks (you later find out she pregnant when this happens) her and punches her face repeatedly until she goes into a coma.  If you enjoy this kind of movie, you need to seek professional help, because you're a Sick person just like the people who made this film and the rapist.
The end (or beginning of their story) is tedious with over-acted meaningless chit-chat between Monica's character, her boyfriend, and her ex. Yawn.
SUMMARY: This movie has no redeeming factors. My advice is to avoid exposing your brain to this glorification of hate, brutality, sick behavior, and a segment of society that relishes everything evil and desecrating.",1244764800,23,2009,4.75
1874859,5,B00008YNI2,"Vincent Cassel has been one of my husband's favorite actor for some time now. Ironically, that is how we came to watch this film ""Irreversible."" I knew nothing of this film other than: 1.) Vincent Cassel 2.) Monica Belluci (One of MY favorite actresses; Please watch ""Malena"") 3.) French film. These facts did not prepare me in the least bit for what we were about to see.

I do not actively pursue the ""super-violence"" in film. I do, however, pursue creativity at its greatest with a camera and that is what this film has completely and utterly achieved.

Was it hard to watch? Absolutely. Would I watch it again? Never. Do I think it is one of the greatest achievements in film? Undoubtedly.

If this film had come out in the U.S., it would never have been released under an ""R"" rating. MAYBE NC-17 and thats if luck is on your side. I am saying this to give the viewer of this review a very clear message that the scenes of rape and violence are so hard to watch that tears welled up in my eyes and I had to look away for SEVERAL minutes; the sounds were enough though, believe me.

Almodovar achieves this very specific and rare talent for taking a subject in which no one, and I mean no one, would ever pay for as entertainment for the weekend evening. ""Bad Educacion"" is about priests molesting little boys. Horrible topic but wonderful movie.

Child abuse is very real. And so is RAPE. 1 in 4 women in the U.S. has been raped.

This film is VERY REAL. The rape scene is 9 MINUTES long. You squirm, you are in disgust , and you feel, well, frankly raped yourself. That is why people walked out of the movie theaters.

It is so important for us to understand the plights of others on EVERY level so that we may prevent and educate. Doing this through a film is significant since we are now in the age of iphones, internet; antiquated modes of communication such as books, newspapers, etc are being pushed into oblivion. Thus, the accessibility of this movie with such a powerhouse crew of actors allows random members of the public to experience this compelling film.",1239580800,2,2072,4.465608465608466

1874861,4,B00008YNI2,"This movie is regarded as either redeemable art or as a reprehensible freak show.  That depends whether you think that the filmmaker demonstrated sufficient pathos for Alex, Pierre and Marcus.  Or whether this movie is just a clever gimmick, as an excuse to show relentless cruelty.

For me, that answer is yes:  this movie is art, and there is pathos.  For many the answer will be no.

I actually watched the second half of the movie (the ""good"" half) twice.  It became more poignant and revelatory.  The theme of premonition, and dreaming the future into being, became clearer.  Also, Marcus and Pierre are in a real sense two different parts of the same male soul.  Ironically, their respective roles as savage and intellectual switch at the beginning (chronological end) of the movie.

As things unravel and become more chaotic at the party, you can sense these characters' dsscent into hell. It's not as simple as saying that Alex' behavior precipitated the rape.  It's not that simple.  Actually that is not what is being said here at all.

Most movies start with order and reason, and then create conflict and pain, only to return back to order and reason again.

To describe the vengeance that follows (or in this case, supersedes) would only drain the vocabulary of superlatives.  As the viewer is put through a series of what ""could've been"" . Such as Marcus testing Alex's patience with his reckless drug usage at a party that same evening, forcing her to leave early in disgust.  Or, even following her out the door after she leaves just to make sure she gets a cab ride home.  Pierre even hints at the dangers that lurk about outside as Alex is leaving and tells her to be careful.  If only Marcus and Pierre had put fourth more effort to try to defuse the situation.  If only Marcus had a real ""friend"" instead of his girlfriends ex-boyfriend.

You're almost left with the impression that Pierre really doesn't have his friend's best interests in mind...I mean, what's Pierre's agenda in all this?  Could he really be considered a friend of Marcus given the circumstances involved (an ex-boyfriend who clearly wants Alex back)?  While Marcus almost being forced to react (by the local organized crime elements) without proper prosecution to avenge his own ridiculous behavior at the party.  The film unfolds with Marcus and Pierre being led out of a bar by police.  One in handcuffs, the other with a broken arm (ironic considering Marcus found the right guy at the bar but attacked the other guy he was standing with...just before Pierre saves the day with a fire extinguisher, or so he thought).  And ends with Alex reading a book underneath a bright blue sky.  She's alone with her thoughts, perhaps contemplating her approach to Marcus concerning her possible pregnancy. Or, was she thinking about Pierre (considering what she was reading)?  ...""I've changed my mind, I take it back, erase and rewind""...

1874889,5,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible was disturbing, unquestionably.  It was probably one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen.  Two of the more notable scenes had me wanting to look away, something that the the common day torture porn movies can't seem to manage (though I stay away from them as a rule).  Everything in these reviews are right in that regard -- it's not for those with soft stomachs.  However, it's also a powerful film that will stick with you for several days after viewing if you can absorb it all.

Some of the reviews call it exploitive and some call it a revenge film... I'd say it's absolutely neither.  It doesn't use the violence/rape as a tool for satisfaction and it doesn't use it as an excuse for later actions.  In a typical revenge film the initial incident (in this case the rape of Alex) is merely the starting point for the revenge character (in this case Marcus) to go on a wild spree righting the wrongs (the fire extinguisher scene).  However, because we are initially shocked and horrified by the murder with the fire extinguisher, we gain no satisfaction from it, so it's hardly called revenge (knowing it's the wrong man doesn't help either).  When we see the rape scene we know there is no satisfaction in the ""revenge"", so it's merely disturbing and doesn't serve as an excuse for Marcus' actions.  It proceeds to a small fight at a party which ends in Alex leaving - gut wrenching, if you didn't have your eyes closed for what the character had to go through 10 minutes earlier.  Then, end with Marcus and Alex happily together in bed pissing away time as two people very comfortable with each other might do.  Ultimately the fact that it ends with calm and caring scenes is all the more depressing... You know their future, while they sit there idly blissful.

This film would have been grossly different had it been in chronological order.  It could easily be called an exploitive revenge flick with extreme violence and odd structure (an unsatisfying ending and with disproportionately happy beginning) - I'd bet chronologically it'd be an NC-17.  While, fundamentally, the order as it stands makes this a film against rape and murder - certainly there was no satisfaction taken from either of them and the direction demanded that the impact be fully felt.",1224720000,2,2288,4.742424242424242

Or in the worst case, when we willingly sacrifice our good inner self for other temporary pleasures that ultimately lead us to a nightmare.

1874892,5,B00008YNI2,"I just finished watching this film, and I found it to be more different than any movie I have ever seen. As other reviewers have said, the story plot is told in reverse. The urban feel of it appealed to me, the setting so to speak. The actors were brilliant in this. I have never seen such strong emotional parts being played. At first, I really wondered what was going on with the camera moving all kind of ways showing walls, street scenes, and a man raging with anger. The raging man, Marcus, played by Vincent Cassel really drew me into the film. I didn't want to stop watching.

Many have given the story plot here in reviews, so I really do not need to go back over that. If you do decide to watch this move, make sure you can handle realistic graphic scenes. There is not a cut and dry here. It is an 'in your face' type of movie. There is nothing left to the imgination when it comes to the rape scene or anything else. You can almost feel what is happening. It challenged me emotionally as well as psychologically.

As the story ended, that is when I felt attached to Alex played by Monica Bellucci. I saw a beautiful happy woman face torment, but never knew the real Alex till the end.

As for the director, Gaspar Noe, I really think he was challenging the viewer. Sometimes we do not want to face reality, and he makes you face it straight on. If you are an emotional person, this will touch you in many ways. I got to say, it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It is a very different type of film and the ending is wild. I do not know another word for the ending.

Irreversible is gimmicky pretentious camera work and oppressive soundtrack which makes you want to throw up, and an unnecessarily long rape scene which is only one of the scenes of sordid and sickening violence. There is something peculiarly poignant about how it ends, but it is not enough to redeem the film. Monica Belluci is amazing, especially in the play of emotions over her pregnancy test. But again, not enough to redeem a film that is essentially designed to shock and disturb. Life can be pretty grim as it is without even grimmer fiction thrown in for good measure.

Vengeance reverses nothing",1212710400,11,845,4.909090909090909
1874909,4,B00008YNI2,"Written, directed, edited, and photographed by the Argentinian-born French Gaspar Noe and released in 2002. Irreversible starts from where Noe's previous work (Seul Contre Tous) left us, and with the same character: the butcher; only to diverge shortly after into a separate entity.
""Irreversible"" is not by any mean a linear continuum to ""Seul Contre Tous"" but the initial (and only) sequence featuring the previous protagonist would emphasize the fact that Irreversible will deal with a similar territoire: nihilism, absurdism, existentialism.

Noe's cinematography is strikingly remarkable for computer-edited long sequences (merging into very few long scenes). The camera is so shaky initially, and continuously rotating giving the feeling of confusion and loss (adding the smart voice sound effect). As the movie progresses folding back in time (retrospective), things will make more sense and at the same time the camera would become less and less lost, more focused, and more light would dissipate into the picture. The movie reaches a climax after what the picture becomes intensely (and unrealistically) monochromatic, only to reach complete blurriness.

Irreversible is not a movie for everybody at all, it needs a lot of ""open-mindness"", it contains one of the most violent scenes I've ever scene. Noe's camera is as intrusive and as rude as the horror and the violence it captures, and refuses to drive away from an ugly scene.

Compared to his previous (Seul Contre Tous), I see Irreversible as more shocking and more confident. Bellucci gives a remarkable performance (only surpassed by her performance in Tornatore's Malena)",1211932800,2,1639,5.44488188976378
1874910,5,B00008YNI2,"The intensity of this film is so ravenous that I don't think I'll be watching this again anytime soon. Gaspar Noe who has given us ""Un contre tous"" has raised his shock level once again.
It is hard to shake me up in front of a movie or TV screen, but Irreversible did it. Five rock solid stars for an unforgettable atmosphere, nauseating camera moves, a non linear film structure, meticulous direction and the usual rock solid performance by Vincent Kassel.",1210723200,,457,4.654320987654321
1874911,5,B00008YNI2,"Judging by the great amount of reviews, it is obvious for me that, either loving it or hating it, this film does indeed ""scar"" (as David Fincher would put it) the viewer. The fact that some people couldn't stand the agitated camera work or the extreme violence, doesn't mean it is a bad film; such clasification is rather superficial, for the true value of a cinematic experience doesn't rely on the lack (or for that matter, the amount) of violence. There are notable examples of great films, both with or without any violence, even within the body of work of a single director (take for instance David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" and ""The Straight Story"" as examples of an ultra-violent film and an innocent Disney-type family-movie, both of which are truly excellent). So, with that in mind, I believe Irreversible to be a masterpiece, because it forces the viewer to realize the frailty of human condition. To achieve that purpose, the backwards plot is essential because it presents in the first place a tragic consequence; so, when you realize that a terrible tragedy (not only for Monica Bellucci's character but for other characters as well) is the result of a chain of events, all of which are consequences of a single first event (depicted at the film's ending), you become aware of the lack of control we have in our lives and that irreversible consequences may follow almost every decision, the realization of which is especially harrowing, since that first event has (apparently) nothing to do with the violence it ultimately causes. In all, this is a really bleak and pessimistic film, so its understandable that someone looking for the average entertainment quota doesn't care very much for it. However, if you like movies that scar your soul and leave you thinking for many days after, this really is a great film.",1208995200,2,1824,4.868167202572347

Having seen it, I am left without words to describe it...

I suggest to anyone interested that you read these reviews.  I agree with just about every single person's viewpoint of this film, from the praise of the filmmaking and acting to the horror and disgust over the intense violence and seediness.  The bottom line is this: I saw it, and I'm neither glad nor regretful that I did.  But my advice is that you rent or borrow this film, not purchase it.

Yet when reading through them, I somehow missed the gist of what this film offers and was swayed by the artsy, oh-so-shocking and profound admiration of the Mapplethorpe worshiping crowd. Stay away. This film offers the most unrelenting view of the decayed side of humanity since, well, I don't know since what.

The swirling camera will induce nausea. The pounding and irritating soundtrack will oppress and annoy. But the content of this film, where life's grimmest losers with nothing interesting to say say it, will unfortunately remain long in the mind. Why would anyone subject themselves to watching such a lurid and grotesque tale? And what is it with Monica Bellucci and violent beatings?

There are no good people here, just vicious and selfish and self-absorbed and deceitful and vain animals who have no currency but sex and violence. That's why we spend ten minutes watching the rape of a woman and at least three watching someone get his head bashed in, complete with nice crunching sounds, in a ninety minute film. There is nothing else. No one in this slimefest has a thought other than ""What can I get and how can I get it?""

Why people choose to live such lives I cannot imagine. (And I write that knowing they would say the same about me.) But why I, or anyone, would want to visit this place, I can even less understand.

1874939,5,B00008YNI2,"I never review movies, I don't have much that's helpful to say about 'em so why bother? But ""Irreversible"" was so tragic and brutal and emotionally damaging, to write something about it seems to release some of the psychological strain felt after experiencing it. And make no mistake, you do not just watch this movie, but experience it. Gaspar Noe's method, whether his challenging cinematic virtuosity, his unflinching depictions of horrible brutality, the actors' improvised dialogue, et cetera... all of this utterly absorbs the viewer, who becomes a very uncomfortable bystander. Many people have left the movie unfinished, too unpleasant on many levels. this would happen in the first half, in which the violence is so awful and camera techniques are dizzying and esoteric (although it parallels the chaos of the main characters' delirious, frantic search), combined with an omnipresent bass tone that unsettles the nerves even further. To call it a challenging film seems to be an understatement. As a sort of emotional ordeal, Noe's film is one of the most powerful I have seen.

Part of the visceral effect of this film is surely its controversial depictions of graphic violence, in its infamous, horrifying rape scene and murder scene. (there is also the early setting in the underground gay club, which has plenty of nightmarish and nasty images.) It seems to cheapen the movie to bring these two scenes up in such a way like they're ""what the movie's all about, yo!"" -- and surely many people will come across this movie in the first place by finding it on ""top 10 disturbing movies"" lists or something where these scenes are invariably described. That said, I can't help but do the same thing, because in all my adult life this is the only movie where I have had to look away when it was just too much. this must be mentioned because the violence is central to the plot and the emotional onslaught (would the beautiful final scenes be so devastating if not for the viewer's knowledge of what happens, and would you even give a damn if the violence represented was just tame and trivial?). Everyone's buttons get pushed different ways of course and that's fine, but it is too easy for others to disparage this movie because of its depictions of terrible violence, but such does not make a movie bad. To attribute this brutality to a lack of morality or sensationalism is very ignorant. The murder scene is not bloody but incredibly cruel and disturbing, rendered in a fluid shot that makes it too close for comfort. When Monica Bellucci is raped and beaten it's even worse, a static shot that looks on and on for what seems like an eternity. As bad as it sounds (and it's much worse to see), this film does not sensationalize violence -- I can think of few movies that are more _anti_-violence.

The reason for this is the structural device. On paper, this sounds like a standard rape-and-revenge tale if presented linearly. But ""Irreversible"" is told backwards, starting (ending) from the aftermath of the showdown with the suspected rapist to the elegiac final (beginning) scenes of tenderness and beauty and warmth before everything unravels later in the story. The violence opens the film, rather than concluding it. The title card at the movie's end (story's beginning), ""Time destroys all things,"" is not so much a ""deep philosophical point"" or anything in my opinion, but a simple summation of why ""Irreversible"" is so tragic. the way violence begets violence and how certain causal relations gain different meaning is interesting, but the real core of this movie is a poignant, heartbreaking message about the delicacy upon which all the beauty in life can depend. When the dialogue in later scenes `foreshadows' (if that's the right term) horrors not yet experienced by the characters, the unrecognized significance hits the viewer like a sledgehammer. Not very subtle, and pretty manipulative really, but very affecting. Actually, the scene where they make love in their apartment is beautiful but disturbing in its own way... we all understand the hitchcockian idea of suspense where the viewer knows more than the characters - well, this is like anti-suspense because we already know the outcome and it makes the film's last scenes soooo wrenching. It plays out like a memory, moving from the great ugliness of present to the comforting idyll of the past. This too is very sad if you think about it.

Much credit must go to acting. Monica Bellucci, Vincent Cassell, and Albert Dupontel are all very good and realistic, and the dialogue is largely improvised making each scene more genuine and affecting. Bellucci and Cassell were married at the time the movie was made and their intimacy underscores the relationship of their characters and their erotic scenes together are very natural and lovely. (the tunnel scene and its peculiar rapist, however, underscores rape as an act of violence, not sexuality, and Bellucci deserves kudos with her brave portrayal of this traumatizing episode.)

This review is almost at the word limit, I have to stop but I feel like I could write a book. I don't know anything about movies anyway. SO. In one sense, it's hard to recommend this movie -- but you can probably say ex ante whether your experience with ""Irreversible"" will be rewarding (whether you enjoy the film or not). You may stay far away, and you may turn it off during the first 45 minutes, finding it too unbearable. And no doubt, it is deeply upsetting, but I would like to think that most people would be able to ""handle"" this, and an intelligent viewer should be able to appreciate the violence in context. Therefore in another sense, I highly recommend ""Irreversible"". It's simply an amazing film. You will not exactly _enjoy_ it, but it will haunt you for days if not weeks or longer, and provoke introspection of which few other films are capable.",1202860800,6,5878,4.89859437751004

  All I can say is that it is probably the only film out there that I might tell someone not to watch. I am not calling this a bad film or a good film. It is effective. During the rape scene you feel like you are right there with Monica Belucci. After I watched it I wanted to go out and kill someone with my bare hands, I was bloodthirsty. I was so angry that such things can be done to innocent people. I have never had such an emotional response to a film, and I watch A LOT of films. It made me feel like the world was a horrible place filled with horrific people. Not a good feeling. I will never watch this film again. Proceed at your own risk.",1200182400,27,931,4.054347826086956
1874941,3,B00008YNI2,"This film has undeniable merit which others have described better than I, but I can't resist warning you.... this is extremey rough stuff. I'm hardly a prude, I celebrate both nudity and sexuality in all cinematic shapes and sizes and varieties.... and I don't condemn violence in film if it makes a point or moves along a story or a character's development... and I sincerely applaud directors who aren't afraid to go to the edge.

And I'm an absolute believer in artistic freedom.

But for the first time in my entire life I watched a scene in a film and had the immediate reaction that it should have been censored. Not by a government or by legislation, but at least by common sense. By common decency. What's been referred to as the ""tunnel sequence"" is, by a mile, the single most violent scene I've ever witnessed on a screen. In a twisted way it's a credit to the actors and director that the scene is so disturbing because it achieves complete reality, complete believability. But to what end?

We all have our darker tastes and I'll admit to having rented a few exploitation flicks over the years like ""Hostel II,"" all the way back to ""Last House on the Left""... but in all these films you're able to say ""It's only a movie.""

The tunnel sequence couldn't be more real if it actually was. And frankly I'm not sure that is wasn't. Don't watch this film unless you're ready to have some deeply, deeply horrifying images (and sounds) branded into your consciousness. This is a film I truly regret having seen.",1196467200,6,1516,4.583025830258302
1874942,2,B00008YNI2,"as another reviewer put it, ""i don't know how to rate this.""
it deserves 5 stars just for the innovativeness of camera work, color and creativity of how the story is put together alone.
however, it was a hard movie for me to get into because of all those aspects (except the creativeness).

the story is simple: a man's girlfriend is raped and beaten and he goes on a hunt for the man who victimized her. but the story isn't told straight forward, its put together from the end, to the beginning with flashbacks in between.

the 2 scenes that will have you thinking: ""OH MY GOD! STOP ALREADY!!!"" are of:
---a man being beaten in the head repeatedly until his face is no longer a face, but a bloody pulp.
---monica belluci's character being sodimized for over 10 minutes!!! then being punched and kicked in the face.

i'm not a very squeamish person but the realism of those scenes, esp. the rape scene caused me to look away at some points and fast forward a bit because it was too much.

1874953,4,B00008YNI2,"I`ve been waiting to see this 2002 movie for a long time.  Several of my Amazon friends have seen it and warned me of its brutal contents, but I had to see for myself.  Since it is a foreign film, save yourself some time and order it here at Amazon, because your local store probably won't carry it.

The movie is told in reverse.  I had a beer before I saw this and actually thought I was feeling it when the credits came on.  No, it wasn't that, the filmmaker had decided to portray it with very unique camera angles.  I was impressed to say the least.  This film audio portion is in French and it's subtitled English.  I do speak French and was surprised to find that many times the subtitles did not really match what the actors were actually saying.  I think, they were trying to shorten the dialogue up so you could read faster.

In essence what happens is that a beautiful girl, Alex  (Monica Bellucci) is dating this carefree and party loving, immature guy, Marcus (Vincent Cassel), who can't seem to grow up---wait a minute, isn't that most men?  They are going to a party with a mutual friend (her ex-boyfriend), Pierre.  Pierre is supposed to drive them, but his car breaks down and he phones Alex and Marcus to tell them they will take the subway together.  Marcus snorts a little coke and his party antics make Alex upset.  She leaves the party and said she's walking home alone, despite Pierre's insistence that she wait and they go home together.  A streetwalker, tells Alex to take the underpass ""it's safer"" when she tries to cross the busy street.  She heeds the advice and gets brutally raped.  What made it more disturbing was a man enters the tunnel, observes what is happening and turns around and walks away, wow, how heartless!  Marcus then drags Pierre into seeking revenge and they meet a man who does just that for money.

While I enjoyed this movie, it is quite disturbing.  However, I found myself thinking about this film over and over again right after I viewed it.  It wasn't that it was so brutal that I felt sorry for the victims, it was the message the film was trying to convey.  I believe that the filmmaker was trying to show how short life is and that we never know when something tragic will happen to those we love.  The title, Irreversible, says it to me.  We can't go back in time and change the bad things that happen in life.  I got a very strong message from this, and that is to show the people you love that you do care about them and tell them before it's too late.

This is definitely not a ""chick flick"" or for the faint at heart, but the message is much stronger than your classic rape and revenge horror flicks and is much deeper.  The movie is well acted and photographed.  If your into the extreme this is for you, with a deep, deep message.",1193788800,7,2796,4.385214007782102
1874954,5,B00008YNI2,"While this film is notorious for its horrific scenes of rape and revenge, I think that many people are missing the point of this movie.  Yes, these scenes are hard to watch and extremely graphic, but the later/earlier scenes are just as honest and intimate.  Each scene is a world unto its own, full of little embarrassments, honest love, and (unfortunately) brutal violence.  I think the filmmaker is forcing the audience to look at each moment in our own lives and realize that we do not know what will happen next.  Each moment with a loved one could be our very last.  Each party we attend could be the last time we see the love of our lives.  Every decision we make, no matter how full of  rage/love/indifference we are at the time, can never be unmade.  They are, like the title, irreversible.  Rarely does a film of any genre stick in my mind for as long as this one did, and not just because of how angry and upset I was about poor Monica Belucci's fate, but also because of the sweet love scenes between her and the men who are also destroyed by revenge.  Love it or loathe it, this movie is not exploitative drivel, it is art of the highest form: the kind that makes you think.",1191715200,5,1187,4.3545454545454545
1874955,3,B00008YNI2,"Well, I was disturbed.  I did have to watch this movie twice to fully understand, i watched it like it plays for the first time through, then I programmed the chapters backwards in my DVD player to watch it 'in reverse'.  I skipped the rape scene 2nd time around b/c I cried the first time.  I just don't know what to say about this movie, except that I don't really think it is exploitation, but it is horrifying and it is something that happens everyday to innocent people.  This is an important movie for that fact alone.  The scene of revenge really makes me angry because thst guy was not the rapist, the rapist was standing next to the guy who got his head bashed in.  Explicit sex, yes, some places have brief glimpses of sex, but thank God the rape scene was just simulated.  If you have ever experienced the horror of rape, do not watch this film.",1191369600,4,856,4.345911949685535
1874956,5,B00008YNI2,"I feel like there's a message in this movie somewhere.

As the title implies it's about things that happened that cannot be reversed.  I suppose most people have things like this in their life.  I have far too many of these things.

For me it was the tragic mistake of telling someone I had put a curse on them.  Those words found their way to the demonic gods in the universe.  At that point my life was effectively over as far as ever being happy.  Lives were destroyed and the world will be a different place as a result.

A curse is in fact not reversible.  It will either harm the intended target or, if the sender changes their mind, the curse will return to them 100 times worse which is what happened to me.  In fact I had no idea what I was even saying nor did I understand the terrible dangers involved.

In the movie Alex was on a path and was going to call a taxi cab but someone recommended she walk through the underpass and she took a major wrong turn.  That decision changed her life forever.

The movie plays in reverse so at the end we see how everything was when things were normal with so many hopes and dreams for the future.

That's where I am right now.  Thinking about what could have been, what should have been, but for a few reckless and stupid words spoken in anger.

It's weird but sometimes I feel movies are made just to tell me something.  It's probably my imagination.

1874957,3,B00008YNI2,"This film is ugly, brutal, depressing, visceral, and hopeless. The
first time I saw it, I was devastated. I reeled for days afterwards.
But seeing it a 2nd time, I didn't care for it as much, in fact, I feel
I've been had. Its impact is really felt the first time you see it,
because seeing it the 2nd time, you realise a lot of things about it
that aren't particularly good. Most of the dialogue is poor (most of it
was improvised, and not very well), the violence of the film is
purposely over the top, and Noe the director seems to delight in
showing nasty stuff without really bringing a sense of art to it. He
enjoys rubbing your face in the sleazy, horrific violence, but has no
purpose other than saying ""life is brutal"". I can't deny that the film
did have a great impact upon first viewing, but too often when one's
sense are assaulted (like they are here), you can mistake that for
great, artistic film-making.

Technically, the film is astounding. It was shot mostly in long takes,
but edited together with CGI effects (the smashing of the head in the
gay bar at the beginning was done digitally, as part of the rape
scene). It's definitely a curiosity, but realise what you're getting
into. It's really not for the squeamish. The opening scene in the gay
bar is dizzying and brutal, and the rape scene is beyond brutal. Noe
films the rape scene in one take, which makes it even more difficult to
watch. Is the film art? No, it isn't. Simply because the film polarized
audiences doesn't make it art (a common assumption by people). Noe's
films (he's only complete 2 features) aren't really deep or anything,
just pessimistic and brutal.

A telling episode about Noe happened a year or so ago. The IFC Theater
in NYC has a feature they do occasionally. They bring in a filmmaker to
introduce a film they admire. Noe showed his first film, I Stand Alone,
and Pasolini's Salo. After Noe's film concluded, he talked to the
audience on why he wanted to show Salo. All he talked about was the
coprophilia scenes (aka the s**t eating scenes). He didn't talk about
anything else that Salo had to offer (in terms of its message on
fascism, sexual perversion, the cinematography, the production design).
Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom is actually an excellent film. It's
incredibly depressing and brutal, but has a real sense of art and is a
genuinely controversial film, even to this day. Noe's films (he's made
only 2) are not like this at all. Both I Stand Alone and Irreversible
hit you in the face the first time you see them, but you shake it off,
and Noe has nothing more to give you. This film has no resonance at
all. It's just for shock value.",1189468800,6,2654,4.481404958677686

It is perverse to say the least but still I think it may be the first 10 minutes the of the film that onestly shocked me. I almost could not believe what I was seeing. Honestly these acts of voilence take a stronger hold as the film moves along. Though the rape scene is graphic it doesnt really ""hit"" you until several scenes later wen you get to know and even care about this free spirited women who seem to have a great deal to look forward to.

1874973,4,B00008YNI2,"The title of my review is no joke. This is a harsh film that should be treated as such.  It is a grueling tale told from end to beginning, like that of ""Memento.""

It's dizzy effects in the beginning fade to subtle as the story unravels itself.  Be warned that the first half of the movie is extremely violent from scenes of a bloody beating to a horrific-ly realistic rape scene involving Monica Bellucci's character.

As jarring as the movie is, it should not be swept under the carpet as some celloid trash.  It delves deep into one's being and makes the viewer say, ""That couldn't possibly happen in 'real' life."" Yet, revenge is very real in every sense of the word.

Kudos to Ms. Bellucci for taking on such a dramatically daring role that no other ""Hollywood"" actress would even dare to do.  It seems so real what is happening to her you want to cry and/or kick the hell out of the man that brutalizes her.",1182643200,2,913,4.398809523809524

I was lucky enough to originally see this film on a large cinema screen as part of the ""French Film Festival"" in the year of it's original release.
I didn't know much about it, other than the rumour that it contained a fairly vicious rape scene. That it did.
Five minutes in, it has some other stuff as well that took me completely by surprise and jolted me to attention. I've seen my share of sick stuff, but this was something totally new.

The plot of the film is simple: a woman (Monica Belucci) is brutally raped by a stranger; and her boyfriend (Vincent Cassel) and ex-boyfriend (Albert Dupontel) who are best friends set out for revenge. What is crucial, the story is told backward.

The most obvious success for this film is the directing by Noe. He has crafted a nightmare that is both original and horrifying. If the inferno exists somewhere, one of its circles definitely looks like the ""The Rectum"" bar, and the other - like the underpass where Alex (Monica Belucci) was brutally sodomized and beaten for long nine minutes that seemed as an eternity. The pulsing score that accompanies the film contains, for the first sixty minutes, a constant 27-hertz tone specifically designed by No to cause nausea in the audience. It felt like someone was constantly drilling the holes in my head. The director creates the scenes of such pain and violence that makes ""Natural Born Killers"" look and feel like a puppet show. One of these is a scene where a man gets his head bashed in with a fire extinguisher with the camera never turned away and the sound is amplified.

The movie shocks you, and then it goes and shocks you even more when there is no violence on the screen. I broke in tears during the bedroom scene - so much love, tenderness and desire Monica and Vincent had for each other. They did not know what was ahead; I did.

In the end, one cannot help questioning the very fragile, illusory nature of happiness, how easy it is to destroy everything. Is it a blessing or curse not to know what lies ahead and not be able to change the future?

Dostoevsky said almost hundred and fifty years ago that the Beauty will save the world. I don't know. Not this world. Not during my time.

""Irreversible"" is a shocking anti-violence film; one has to decide whether he or she wants to see it. I personally think it is a must see but I would not be surprised if a lot of viewers refuse.",1175644800,5,1991,4.532033426183844

If you like films that make you feel happy about being alive, this isn't for you.  If you like films that don't make you think, this isn't for you.

Much has been and will be written of the film's violence and rape scene.  Less will be written about the ways the director makes you feel uncomfortable (sound, camera work and lighting effects).  Trust me, it all works, and if you have a good sound system or are prone to seizures you may just want to stay away from this one.  Noe likes dealing with mass manipulation through things like film, and this movie is no exception.  Its violence and rape scene don't make this an effective film, however.  It's what leads up to it (in reverse order, of course.)

Naysayers will easily dismiss this film as vile, and they are right.  But it is also honest and unafraid.  To dismiss it without seeing it, however, shows how little some people know.  You can't help but be moved by what Noe is doing, and he isn't trying to move you in a positive way.  He's making a statement, and it's a statement that says revenge is hideous and sometimes necessary; that men are beasts (and that's sometimes a saving grace); and that people don't make the most of the time they are given.

What bothers me are not the admittedly disturbing scenes, but rather the banality of the film's underlying idea, which the director, Gaspar Noe, attempted to convey in a thoroughly unremarkable fashion. The characters are not shown in any depth; in fact, there is no meaningful dialogue or any other attempt at all to introduce them to the viewer. Camera work is simply awful - somebody should have explained to the cameraman that rotating a hand-held camera at will for minutes at a time does not always produce art. Apparently, these sterile methods combined with shocking scenes of rape and murder are supposed to produce a new form of cinma vrit.

In short, even though in France almost every baker is an ""artiste"" (think ""baguette artisanale""), Mr. Noe is not a ""cinaste"" even by French standards: hit someone in the face with a teakettle and call it art!",1171497600,9,939,4.7607361963190185

Monica Bellucci should be commended for giving such a gutsy performance, one that most people would not subject themselves to.

Myself, with my taste for this sort of film, thought it was not as graphic as most people will find it. It takes a certain type of person to view it. I watched it twice while I had it as the video store would only let me have it overnight. In fact, the scene where they beat the perpetrator to death in the club, led me to believe that he actually enjoyed being murdered since he was a sadist to begin with.

But its done in a very artistic manner, with the intention of numbing the audience.  This movie wouldn't have the same effect if it was told in the more standard format.  Brilliant filmmaking.

There are a couple of the most savage and violent scenes I have ever experienced. They are horrifying, probably too much for some people to bare.

You actually feel like you're watching a woman get brutally assaulted...and even with all that going on, the director manages to add another disturbing elemant to the shot toward the end. While a lot of ""disturbing-film-list"" movies can be pointless and gratuitous, the violence here is not only realistic and essential to the storytelling, but actually underscores the even more disturbing ""can't turn back time/no matter how bad it is it can get MUCH worse"" message contained in the characters' actions and futile attempts at ""justice"". Not for the faint of heart, but if you love the artistic aspect of movie-making, this is an amazingly crafted film that almost makes you feel as if you're being slapped in the face while watching.",1159833600,6,1226,5.074257425742574
1875023,5,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible sparked my interest because several politicians in Australia wanted to have it banned here. I wanted to know why I shouldn't be allowed to see this film.
The device of running each of the scenes in reverse order is an effective one in this film and it reverses ""causality"" and we see the results of a situation before we film out what caused it.

We meet Monica Bellucci's boyfriend and their mutual friend early in the film and I thought that they were a couple of sick, testosterone driven criminals.... However, slowly, but surely, we discover the horrible truth - that a brutal and inhuman act of violence towards Monica Bellucci has pushed them over the edge.

We step deeper and deeper back in time and learn that the trio of friends were leading a happy bohemian life. We finally find Monica Bellucci in the final (first) scene peacefully ready a book on the grass of a park, children a playing nearby and the Allegretto from Beethoven's 7th Symphony is playing in the background. The music brings us both peace at the end of this film and also reminds us of the tragedy we have just witnessed.

Irreversible is a difficult film. It is difficult to watch and difficult to consider. It shows us entropy - of time, relationships, beauty and idealism. I guess it also shows us that extreme situations can push normally decent human beings into barbarism.

I don't think I would or could watch Irreversible again any time soon. However, I am glad that I've seen it and I certainly don't think it should have been banned.

Please understand that this is a very adult movie and it certainly isn't for everyone. Irreversible is a very confronting experience. I haven't made up my mind yet about the importance of that experience.",1158624000,8,1742,4.698360655737705
1875024,5,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible may be an ultra violent film that will shock certain unsuspecting audiences upon first viewing, but it illustrates a fundamental point about ""relationships."" Whether we like it or not, someday our relationships will end. No matter how happy you may seem with a girl, someday there will be an impenetrable distance between you -- it could be anything from growing bored with each other to death. The fact still remains that all good things eventually come to an end, and this film illustrates that point in a rather over the top, yet tragic way. The film opens up with two men rummaging through a homosexual night club. They are in a world of depravity; a dissonant sounding drone plays over a very shaky camera. This is an underworld of depravity; they are far from the moral world and they are slowly sinking into madness. They are looking for a man -- a man who has committed one of the worst sins imaginable against the woman that they both love. This man has raped and brutally beat a woman to near death. And our heroes are looking for vindictive revenge. What results is one of the most brutal scenes ever captured on film. Irreversible doesn't look away, it captures the brutality with an unflinching sense of realism. Unlike many Hollywood films that only imply, this film doesn't care about your personal confront. It fleshes everything out and shows you the brutality of the situation. After that, we slowly travel to the beginning...

This is a very powerful film. It is one of the darkest movies I have ever seen, which is saying a lot. Overall, I think this film is better and more effective than I Stand Alone. What makes this movie good is that it takes normal people (like you and me) and shows how they can turn into extremely violent ticking time bombs. This film is a lot like Requiem for a Dream, since practically everyone in the movie goes from being really happy to having their lives ruined. Of course, the film is played backwards, which in a way makes the film even more tragic.

1875025,3,B00008YNI2,"Why did so many people have trouble following this movie? Once you realize that the scenes are in reverse order -- which should become apparent early in the film -- the narrative is quite simple. And this is actually one of the film's weaknesses.

In ""Memento,"" for example, the labyrinthine reversed narrative continually forces the viewer to reinterpret everything seen earlier (later) in the movie. ""5x2"" provides increasing psychological depth and poignance as the story of the two lovers moves towards its conclusion (beginning). But with ""Irreversible,"" it's just ... well, backwards. The relatively peaceful scenes following the rape are, for the most part, tedious and dull and overlong. The big ""surprise"" near the end is a wet firecracker compared to several of the powerful scenes in the first part of the film.

It is these earlier scenes from which ""Irreversible"" has surely gained its accolades, and much of this praise is well deserved. Both the rape and (especially) the attack with the fire extinguisher are truly horrifying -- and that's a good thing. Rarely has the repellence of brutal acts like these been caught so vividly on film.

The spinning, meandering camerawork and monotonous thudding soundtrack are less successful, however. The techniques themselves are interesting and effective at first, but the viewer's initial sense of disorientation and unease soon turns to simple irritation as the sight and sound gimmicks overstay their welcome.

""Irreversible"" contains a number of powerful scenes and is well worth seeing for those who can stomach the violence. Just don't come in expecting a brilliant narrative, depth of characterization, or psychological complexity.",1157760000,6,1695,5.360902255639098

Odd; perhaps that is they way they do it in France, I thought. Then it donned on me--the title--Irreversible. Very clever, this Noe guy. And in fact, the entire movie tells the story in reverse order. What the viewer experiences is the climax, in all of its brutal ugliness, first, followed by the events that lead up to it, and along the way, the viewer becomes aware of the complexity of emotions, actions and relationships between the main characters.

Having heard of Noe's other works, including ""I Stand Alone,"" I wondered if his true fascination lies with violence and shock value because ""Irreversible"" contains incredibly graphic violence (some of it sexual) that would no doubt please the hardest of the hardcore gore hounds. But, this reviewer does not think it is Noe's only fascination.

There is more to Noe's method than just madness. The rape scene is indeed one of the longest, but, after the dizzying violence (literally--the camera panning is a little annoying), the story surfaces.  Despite the subtle character development, Noe effectively pulls the viewer into a feeling of intimacy shared with the two lovers.  The graphic and brutally intense scenes become memories off somewhere in the distance--the writing is already on the wall and ""future"" events cannot be changed.  This churns one's stomach even more than the violence witnessed early on.  In fact, the last scene--as simple as it is--may be Noe's most effective and artistic, as this theme truly resonates with the viewer and transcends all of the ugliness.

I can say I recommend this film, but be warned, its not easy to watch. It is not for the easily offended, weak at heart and *definitely* not for children",1155686400,2,1829,4.880645161290323
1875030,4,B00008YNI2,"As soon as the opening credits roll ( or collapse rather ), you know you're in for something. At the start you don't understand what's going on because the camera is shaking all over the place and you can't make out who's who and why there's so much arguing and fighting. Persevere and you begin to understand why, the camera steadies and a natural storyline begins to come to the fore.

Realizing that his wife has been badly beaten up, one guy and his friend try to find out who took out this atrocity. Hence the shaky camera can be described as "" blind with rage."" It's interestingly done. You'll soon find out that the movie goes backwards ( seems to be the fashion these days ) in finding out how this all came about. So in order to find out how this works you have to go backwards to go forwards.

We find out more about the trio the more we dig into the film. And it also brings to mind how people change completely after someone close to them has been assaulted. The uncontrollable rage that eats inside them. In a way, the fact this film goes backwards reminds you that when you ask someone who has lived with this trauma, they will often speak of their wish to go back to how it was before and how they wish they could turn back the hands of time. People also don't realize that this can last for a long, long time. They simply cannot be the person they used to be. And as a result this film portrays that excellently.

However, it's not a film that can be watched lightly. This can be brutal stuff as it's unrelenting realism when it pictures would make anyone wince. I will wilfully admit that the centrepiece of the movie ( if you can call it that ) was Monica Belucci's rape scene. So brutal and ugly was it that I practically had to skip whatever was the chapter. Watching what I did, I could feel every kick and every beating that was given and I just winced and looked away. It was that brutal.

A film that will only test the bravest souls. It's not for the squeamish. To be quite honest, it's a hard film to recommend but it's something that must be given respect in terms of the sheer audacity to make a film like this. However if you want realism in your movies then I think this must be the film for you. Just be careful you don't get any nightmares.

1875031,5,B00008YNI2,"I never thought I would be giving 5 stars to a film so sickening that I never want to see it again, but here it is. How can I NOT give the highest rating to a film so emotionally vile, that it made me physically kind of nauseaus to watch it, and yet I could not tear my eyes off this film? I can't think of any other movie that's ever had such a striking effect on me. And on others, obviously.

A lot of people call this movie perverted, gratuitous, pretentious. Well, here is what I want to ask - what is truly sicker, depicted violence that hooks 13-year-old kids, that makes moviegoers whoop with glee, and makes them want to see more of it? OR, violence that is depicted so faithful to reality, that it makes people physically ill, that makes people denounce it, and never want to see it again? What do you think those two scenarios represent? The first, in my eyes, is standard Hollywood violence, whereas the second scenario is Irreversible. And how would REAL violence make most normal people feel? Would a healthy, normal person enjoy watching a real beating, or a real rape? Or would he/she be disgusted and disturbed?

Well, the reason I believe Irreversible is a very brave film and quite genius, is because it courageously depicts violence as it really is and makes the viewer feel a TRUE reaction... That first 30 minutes is very difficult to watch, and the use of motion-sickness-inducing camera angles, along with very disturbing audio, all cleverly combine to induce that feeling of unease and nausea in the viewer that makes the experience REALISTIC. I've never seen anything like it before. Objectively, cheap horror movies depict worse violence than in this movie, but never do people react in such a visceral way. With good reason.

And, that visceral emotional reaction that this film induces, is why it really is a valuable work of art, and NOT merely some cheesy crap made for shock value. Those who think otherwise either don't understand the point of the film (I am disturbed, if they didn't have such a reaction to this film!), or perhaps they were so disturbed by their own reaction that they wallow in denial of their emotions by denying the artistry of this film.",1154649600,17,2193,4.632390745501286

Don't assume that the other reviewers who have said the same thing are being overly sensitive or too politically correct either - I'm dead serious the rape scene is horrifyingly, horrifyingly graphic.  That's pretty much the only ""sex"" scene so to speak (and I use the word loosely there) so again, this is not erotica if you're looking for that rent a porn movie instead.  Having said that I was moved by this film - the fact that I was horrified shows that it had an effect on me, which is what any good film should do.  If you're a fan of say, Law and Order- Special Victims Unit for example and want to see stories about the real life monsters (e.g. rapists, molesters and so forth) you'll probably like this film.  I was very disappointed that the rapist (I know I'm overusing the word but I'll use it again - horrifyingly depicted as a depraved, chilling utter evil wretch of a human being, regardless of whether or not he was high on drugs at the time) didn't get what was coming to him, the [...] made a clean getaway - it adds to the overall ""scariness"" (for lack of a better word) of the film, it's all too sad but no doubt very true that scum like this guy avoid punishment for their deeds out in the ""real"" world as well. Ultimately that's what makes the film effective and what makes you feel like you've been punched in the gut after watching it - it's a depiction of what can, and probably does, happen out here in the ""real"" world.",1150761600,14,2244,4.2191142191142195
1875044,3,B00008YNI2,"This movie is among the 1000 Best Movies in DVD by Peter Travers, that is why I bought it. During 10 minutes, you see the beautiful Belucci being raped on a tunnel in Paris, and that scene is disturbing. The whole movie is, with an interesting plot told backwards, from the end to the beginning on a full day of the life of these characters. At the beginning of the movie (which would be the end of the story), we are at the club ""Rectum"" (ass in Latin ...), a gay night club where people meet to have sex. There, Marcus is looking for Tenia, the responsible for raping and beating Alex, his girlfriend. Another extremely disturbing scene takes place in that club (but I am not to say, since I don't want to spoil the movie), and so on ... Saying this is not a good movie would not be fair, but it is definetely a movie not to please the majority of the public, with a kind of ""dizzy"" camera style, moving here and there, in circles, crazy, to tell a crazy-disturbing story. It's a French movie, so don't expect anything related to American standards, because European films are different from American. The movie won best film at the Stockholm Film Festival (2002), and was in the official selection of the Sundance Film Festival (2003) and Cannes (2002) among others. The DVD comes with an interesting documentary about the special effects, and two lame ""deleted scenes"" that look more like video clips than deleted scenes. Also a commercial about the soundtrack and several trailers of the movie. The movie is in French with Spanish and English subtitles.

After all, an interesting movie which will please those who like to see the beautiful Bellucci, gay and lesbian movies, violence, disturbing scenes, weird stories, and transgression on art.",1149292800,7,1749,4.678571428571429
1875045,1,B00008YNI2,"A film whose timeline has been altered always begs the question as to how effective the work would be if it were linear.  Would Christopher Nolan's MOMENTO have been more than a blip on the cinematic radar?  How about Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION?  The same should be asked about Gaspar Noe's lurid rape/revenge film, IRREVERSIBLE.

  The plot (from end to beginning) is rather simplistic.  Alex (Monica Bellucci) is in love with Marcus (Vincent Cassel).  For some unknown reason the couple continue to hang out with her wet blanket ex-, Pierre (Albert Dupontel).  The trio attends a party after which Alex is sadistically sodomized by La Tenia (Jo Prestia).  After seeing Alex's beaten body, Marcus (now highly coked up) and Pierre are approached by two hooligans who promise to aid in their search for justice.  The quartet questions some prostitutes before learning the whereabouts of La Tenia (whose name translates as ""the tapeworm"").  With Pierre in tow, Marcus heads to The Rectum, a seedy gay bar, where he hopes to exact vengeance.

  If it weren't for the reverse-order timeline and two scenes of intense brutality this film wouldn't have merited notice.  As it stands, however, IRREVERSIBLE isn't much more than an art house exploitation film.  Some may say that it's a treatise on voyeurism and that audiences will feel themselves compelled to watch even when they know that every scene could be more disturbing than the last.  Others will posit that Noe brings determinism to the fore with his characters dreaming about ""future"" events and eerily foreshadowing their fates.  Yet, while I enjoyed the nauseating camerawork and the lack of temporal touchstones, I found that the film was only compelling when it delved into the disgusting.

  As Skizz Cyzyk says about Chrisopher Nolan's FOLLOWING, ""I liked it until the beginning.""  Likewise, IRREVERSIBLE kept me squirming in my seat until the film came out of the underground and into the light.  I had no connection with any of the characters and the supposedly ""shocking revelation"" that the future victim Alex is pregnant with Marcus' child did nothing but compel me to roll my eyes.  It's as if Noe were trying to make Alex's never ending attack even worse.

Noe's films are very realistic and powerful, he has a talent to challenge the viewier and really send the images from on screen into their head. He showed that very well with the extremely brutal revenge scene in the gay S&M club. Watching Irreversible is a real expierence and in my opinion thats mostly what its ment to be.

I think what I liked the most about this film was the camera work and how it begins with a crazy mixed up ""Blair Witch"" sea sick ride and then slowly calms itself as the movie slips backwards past the violence and ends (begins) with a more subdued flavor (but then spins out into Lynch land once more).  I would be wrong not to warn you about the two notorious scenes of murder and rape/beating... its pretty hard to watch, esp. the rape scene, and thats simply because it goes on and on and on - the man wants us to know that rape is a bad thing, I think.  The murder is really incredible though; the special effects and camera work for that scene is something to behold.  There's also allot of explicit gay sex and never ending dialogue about sex which gets old and uninteresting very quickly.

1875074,4,B00008YNI2,"""Take the underpass. It's safer.""

 - Alex ignores a streetwalker's warning as she heads for a tragic fate that is ""Irreversible""

Monica Bellucci stars in a film that is graphic &, at times tough to watch, & isn't for the faint hearted.

""Irreversible"" has a beautiful young woman named Alex, & her obnoxious & intimidating boyfriend Marcus going to a party with her ex-boyfriend, turned friend, Pierre.

After Alex & Marcus have a small tiff, Alex decides to leave the party & walk home alone.

Failing to hail a taxi, Alex takes a supposed shortcut under an underpass & has a run in with a knife wielding rapist. In one of the more graphic scenes in the film, Alex is raped & beaten within a centimeter of her life.

Marcus & Pierre leave the party & step into a hail of blue police lights & right into the beaten, battered, & coma stricken body of Alex being lifted into a waiting ambulance to take her to the hospital.

Marcus freaks, Pierre is questioned, & a stranger, named Mourad, offers them revenge..., for a price. Marcus accepts dragging Pierre along. Through some interrogating leads, Marcus & Pierre find Alex's attacker, at a hellish gay S&M club, with the tragic & damaging outcome being irreversible.

""Irreverisble"" is easily inspired by the films ""Momento"" & ""The Accused"". The film starts out with the end credits & the confrontation at the gay club & works its way backwards to the beginning.

The film is incredibley graphic to watch. I felt the club scene was much worse than the rape sequence. Both are rough to watch.

The problem I had with the film is that I felt that ""Irreversible"" was out to try & prove something or outdo ""Momento"" & ""The Accused"". It doesn't.

I felt that ""The Accused"" dealt with the subject of rape & the aftermath rather well, (the rape scene in ""Accused"" was more brutal), with this film, Alex is raped & the viewer is left with a big question mark, as far as, if she lives or dies. Maybe thats why the film unspools in reverse. The last image of ""Irreversible"" has Alex in the park lying on a blanket reading a book. it's a halfway peaceful ending to a powerful film (until the weird spinning & light effect takes over).

It also seemed that Alex could have escaped her captor, at the very least in the beginning of the ordeal (kneed him the balls or something) but the film falls for the usual sympathetic victim route. I also felt the rape scene went on too long for somebody not to notice what was happening.

1875076,3,B00008YNI2,"Amazon has a major marketing gaffe if they are trying to sell this move along with the French drama The Dreamers.  A fan of The Dreamers, I checked this one out, and anyone coming from the erotic drama/political commentary of The Dreamers is going to have their pants shocked off by Irreversible.  Both movies are French and show skin, but that's where the similarities stop, and they diverge pretty far from one another, in fact.  I'm boggled that anyone would lump them together.

At any rate, Amazon's marketing got this unsuspecting viewer to check out Irreversible.  It is very tough to watch, not only for the extreme violence, including sexual violence, but the opening scenes use non-stable, moving camera angles that can inspire seasickness directly from your couch!  There is also a grating soundtrack that could drive one to insanity all on its own, regardless of the images it is accompanying.  I admire the director, however, because when I was watching the disturbing opening scenes, I was not just disturbed by the content itself, but by the visual experience (camera angles) and the sounds all around me.

I'm going to give it 3 stars, but this is one of those movies that you either love or hate, depending on your tastes.

What bothers me is that this is ALL STYLE and absolutely NO CONTENT.  What a lame script Noe wrote -- it reminds me of the idiotic short films that dumb males make in film school where they try to show as much violence and sex and rape as they can, then try to do something ""different"" (using storytelling methods that have already been done before but aren't too conventional) to pass it off as intellectual.  The script doesn't have anything thought provoking to say and the characters were ridiculously one-dimensional.  That to me is exploitation.

Don't get me wrong, the cinematography was beautiful and I loved the camera work, but that was pretty much the only thing that was redeeming about Irreversible, and I don't think it was enough to save a bad story.  And I don't really understand why the story needed to be told backwards... to show what if something irreversible can be reversed?  That's the best I can think of, and it's a pretty dumb reason.  I don't think it would have had any different effect if the story was told in order.  On top of that, the film could have been much shorter... but I guess that in doing so it would reveal it's mindless simplicity: random old guy talks about thermodynamics to another random guy (how time destroys things), then a man with another man kills his girlfriend's rapist brutally and his girlfriend had just found out she was pregnant right before the evil man raped her.

So to sum things up... Noe's film is nothing but a pretentious, masturbatory film which unsuccessfully does everything it can to hide it's lack of substance.",1138320000,15,1711,4.635761589403973

Gaspar Noe has offered a film which tops his I Stand Alone in its sheer ability to manipulate and horrify the viewer. Like Memento (although far more engaging), the film unfolds in reverse chronological order, and interesting technique which transforms a would-be-average revenge fantasy into a provocative meditation on the destructive nature of time.

The film begins with distracting camera movements and overwhelming violence as several men avenge the rape of a young woman (a 10 minute scene that drove many critics from the theater at Cannes), and then descends into the realm of these people in their normal lives.

The second half of the film is undoubtedly superior to the first because it dares to draw the viewer in whereas the first half merely smacks you in the face.

The young actress Monica Bellucci, who is the recipient of appalling violence, is particularly exceptional in the final act. This film is difficult to place and will clearly be the subject of much discussion in the years to come.",1137283200,2,1114,5.038043478260869

I have a question though, regarding the impact scene at the Club. Two major surprises unfold here, firstly that it is gentle, cerebral Pierre and not raging, coke-fuelled Marcus that commits the murder (one of the most horribly realistic murder scenes I've ever seen, and so long, it gets to the point where you want the guy to just die already and let it be over) and secondly that 'The Tapeworm' is not the man killed, but his colleague/friend. (The scene of Tapeworm looking down on the dead body and smiling was a knife to the heart (at least it will be the second time you watch the movie and realise he escaped))

I wonder, though, if the movie had been played scene for scene normally, from true beginning to true end, what the impact of these two ""twists"" would have been. Playing the movie backwards, you just don't get it. You don't know Pierre's character yet. You don't know what the rapist looks like. Hmmmm....

Although working in reverse does have it's benefits. The scene with Marcus and Alex waking up to the telephone in particular, where Alex has had a dream of a long, red tunnel (the underpass) and Marcus can't feel his arm (the one that get's so disgustingly snapped in the club)

And of course, the first scene (aka the last scene) of Alex in her summer dress laying in the park with the kids playing on a gorgeous sunny day, it wouldn't mean anything if the movie played forwards, I guess. Same with the party scene. It hits harder backwards.

I also have to mention the soundtrack - the music is alright, but it's the throbbing, repeated blows to the head of the ambient noise that makes the movies sound. Especially the noise in the club. Just a horrible experience, especially with the camera all tilt-a-whirl and out of control, just showing (very explicit!) glimpses of the depravity that is going on.

On the DVD, the extras are slim but interesting. One guy breaks down how they did the special effects (and trust me, it does make the murder scene a little easier to take) and the digital penis is just...funny weird. I think the best part of the extras are the original French teasers. One of them is simply Alex's view as she is being raped, you can't get more simple or effective than that.

There was no revenge!!!!!!!!!!
The person that got killed at the ""Rectum"" was an innocent man.
The rapist did not get killed. In fact you can see him standing there smiling, looking upon the scene.
That's right - Tenia walked away scratch free (evil triumphs!).
Thus, for me, the movie's message became even darker and with a deeper meaning.
It gets into an even more serious (if such a thing is possible) territory by letting the evil win (rapist is unpunished) and letting the good suffer (an ex-pretty woman is in the coma after being brutally raped and beaten, possible in a wheelchair for life, Her now two ex-boyfriends will surely end up in jail, after killing, as it turns out - an innocent man...)

However unlikely, the final moments in the film made me feel that perhaps the director was working on many diverse layers of consciousness within the storyline (maybe all we see in a movie is someone's dream?). In other words - things are not as simple as they seem.

I have to applaud the director for staying true to his artistic vision. Every detail within a frame, every sound and color - everything in this movie has many different meanings.
To put it simply, - the director takes the concept of ""Red/White/Blue"" type of movies to even a higher level.
I am very impressed.
And lucky actors... they must feel very proud to take a part in creation of this masterpiece.

Irreversible hits the viewer like a ton of bricks.

1875095,5,B00008YNI2,"I heard about this movie from a friend and I am a huge fan of foreign films. What is so fascinating about foreign films is that they have so much more freedom to work with, Hence leading me to this beautiful film ""Irreversible"". Now Gasper Noe is a brilliant director, the way Irreversible is shot comes into play with the movie. In the opening scene, the camera work will make you feel dizzy, its similiar to merry go around and a roller coaster, so i didn't like that part not too mention i hate theme parks. Anyway Gasper Noe filmed the movie like this for a reason, just from the opening scene you feel very uncomfortable. Gasper Noe is successsful in maintaining this uncomfortable atompshere throughout the entire movie. Without giving too much away, the movie focuses on revenge and how it starts. As for the graphic scenes, hence, the brutal murder scene and rape scene are also shot very well. The murder is very graphic, does not compare to any American Film. It looks realistic. The infamous rape scene is also very graphic. I have seen many rape scenes in plenty of movies, such as Strawdogs, Showgirls, Leaving las vegas, last house on the left, you name it. What makes this rape scene important is the message it delivers and let me tell you Gasper Noe gets his point across. Since the movie is shot backwards, you kind of seeing it comming and know its gonna be bad. The real important message that Gasper Noe was trying to deliver is how time destroys us. One second you can be having the greatest time of your life and in another second you can be raped, humiliated and left for dead. The irony in this rape scene is that Alex played by Monic Bellucci was walking homr from a party when she was told by a prostitute to take the underground tunnel, Why?? ""Because it safer"". As a film critic like myself, this movie really shows how much American Film makers are limited. We tend to adjust to the overly sensitive. Unfortunately American Film Makers will never have this type of freedom, but we can rely on Gasper Noe to deliver beautiful films like these. Now heres my reccomendation, if you want to see a true-master piece, that is not going to hold back and really deliver what the director  intended to deliver then by all means rent this, but if you have a weak stomach and enjoy hollywoodized movies that apply to the overly sensitive then stay away from this one.",1133222400,5,2386,4.535962877030163
1875096,1,B00008YNI2,"Trust me, you do not need to be exposed to brutal murders and rapes. It's an overrated experience you can do without.

IRREVERSIBLE presents these crimes for viewing, and they amount to psychological assault. I will say this; Noe is very good at providing the viewing public with this ""material."" I believe that the only stuff that can match his movies would be recordings of actual people committing such acts, almost representing snuff movies.

The dialog was mostly improvised by the actors. Noe just followed a rough outline indicating the direction for each scene. The acting was for the most part good, although with this type of direction is unlikely to notice bad acting, since good or even bad actors can just resort to the characters they portray best.

The chronology is reversed (hence it's title), and the story is about a couple of lovers with a friend (female's ex-boyfriend) who went out for a night of fun. They do drugs, her lover takes her granted and the girl leaves the club upset of her lover's behavior. On her way home, she gets raped and beaten almost to death in an underpass by a pimp. Her lover and ex-boyfriend go out in a rampage seeking revenge. Once in the club a confrontation with the alleged rapist turns gruesome and the ex-boyfriend, who was acting as ""the voice of reason"" on the way to the club, ends up beating the hell out of the rapist with a fire extinguisher.

Not much of an original story, so what does the ""director"" decides to do. . .? reverse the chronology and twirl the camera around senselessly to give the illusion of her lover's state after drug abuse and state of mind after finding out the tragedy. Reversing the chronology does something in this movie. It does make you deal with what you just saw and adds sympathy to the characters when you otherwise wouldn't care less. At the end, you feel worse, and horrified, since the end is the beginning of the movie and you already know what will happen. You don't even get a sense of justice since the rapist gets away in the end. The wrong man was killed and the rapist stood there watching and smiling knowing he got away with his crime. Also, the music adapted is not music at all, is something a very low in audio frequency that may be used to disorient a crowd of people; it is very disturbing to your senses. The language is horrendously offensive, (vulgar, racist, homophobic, misogynistic), and they are other disturbing glimpses in scenes that although may not be as devastating as the rape and murder, complement the film's eagerness to shock. The ""director"" thrives in making us uncomfortable.

I guess all the fancy camera twirl, reversed chronological order, long uninterrupted scenes, and the fact that this movie is in French set this one into the ""Art genre."" Personally, I think this is all pretentious work from a director with a short time-line to get a movie done. Monica and her husband (who also plays her lover in this ""film"") had a schedule to work on the Matrix, Noe had to hurry up and get this out. A long time was dedicated to the rape and the murder where computer effects were applied to indicate the horrifying graphical depiction of a head being batched with the fire extinguisher over, and over. The rape was rehearsed over eighth times to ""get it right"" and sound effects were amplified to enhance the violence to the Monica's beating after the rape.

If you take away the two notorious scenes that entice people to watch it (rape and murder), you would end up with absolutely nothing; no plot, very little direction, and some nudity from probably one of the sexiest and most beautiful and talented actress/models in Hollywood today (referring to Monica Belluci, of course). Monica is the reason I check this movie out, I'm a big fan of her work.

Taking into consideration that I would only recommend a movie with the premise that it will entertain its audience, no way in hell can I recommend this to anybody. It's not about the story, but how you feel after watching the horrendous scenes. This goes for all features from Gapar Noe.

Unfortunately, you can classify this movie as simply an exploitation flick. Usually, you can do that and dismiss it. Although the two scenes that make justify placing this ""movie"" into the exploitation category, the fact of the matter is that the rape and murder are just shown for the bad crimes that they  are. Nothing has being enhanced to portray it worst, or make it gorier.

Why only 1 star? Simply, because I can't give it 0. A work of art make of Sh$t is still a bundle of Sh$t. Exposing myself to this type of movies is just not my idea of a pleasant time.

To those individuals who seek to watch this for its horror; I hope it is in fact what you are seeking, because this one will delivered just that.",1132272000,23,4785,4.604460093896714

1875099,5,B00008YNI2,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece, a movie that will NEVER be made in America.  We ask for violence in our movies, but we want it to be quick and (psychologically) painless.  We want sex in our movies, but nothing more than ""boobies"" and simulated, under the blanket sex.  What makes this film so powerful is that it refuses to operate by these conventions--we've always been told that the rape scene in ""The Accused"" was harrowing and groundbreaking.  Frankly, it looks like an episode of ""Sesame Street"" compared to the rape scene in this movie.  Some will argue that I am depraved for wanting to see a realistic rape scene.  The fact is, the scene made me extremely uncomfortable--as a rape scene should.  Why should we get off easily when shown something as heinous as a rape?  I believe that the typical 10 second rape scenes trivialize the rape and make it devoid of the devastating consequences it should have upon the viewer's psyche.  I would also like to commend Gaspar Noe for showing real sex in his movies.  It's about time someone made a movie that proves you can have graphic sex without it being prurient.  Irreversible does for sex what Joyce's Ulysses did for sexuality in literature.  I can only hope that one day Americans will get over their Puritanical roots, because the Europeans, the Japanese and the South Koreans are humiliating us in the film department.",1129766400,18,1386,4.7531380753138075

I wish Irreversible could be discounted as cheap, exploitative trash so that it would not leave me so emotionally scarred. This film presents it's disturbing message in such a daring, orginal way that it's impact lasts for days. The story is told in ""reverse"" starting with a graphic act of violence in what seems to be one of the darkest pits of hell then proceeds to tell the story by showing what preceeded each scene including the most brutal rape scene ever commited to celluloid.  Each scene is one contineous and extensive camera take leaving the viewer amazed, horrified, and drained. The ""end"" of the movie is the morning of the ensuing horror: a morning filled with light, hope, and peace. Showing me such a horrible end first then showing me such a hopeful beginning and subjecting me to such a graphic rape played havoc on my sensibilities. This is filmmaking at it's most daring and extreme. If you are one of those people who like to be ""entertained"" and think movies should be ""fun"", for you I give this 0 stars. For movie fans who think they are ""seen it all"" and think movies should leave a lasting impression (even a harsh one), then you need to watch this movie.

1875101,5,B00008YNI2,"Let me start by saying that this is not a film that will appeal to mainstream American audiences.

The first thing that we should note is this was shot with a rare type of film reel(I'm not in the business, so the name escapes me, but I think it was 16mm) that only allows 20 minutes of consecutive filming before they have to quit and re-load.  For this reason, most of the scenes were shot with one take, and most of the dialog was improv(a la ""Curb"").  If you watch this movie, that is something to keep in mind.

Something else should also be noted.  Gaspar Noe is the director of all scenes except one:  The Tunnel Scene.  As stated above, they had a 20 minute time limit to shoot that scene, and Noe allowed actress Monica Bellucci to direct the whole thing.  So while she was the victim in the scene, she was in complete control the whole time.

On to the film content.  It is a day in the life of a middle class, young French couple...told backwards, a la ""Memento"".  So the audience sees the horrible end to the day first.  All you know at that point is that two normal, and assumably straight guys are looking for a man called ""La Tapia""(The Tapeworm) in an incredibly seedy gay sex club called ""The Rectum"".  Their search ends when one of them bashes in the head of a man they think is ""La Tapia"".  This scene is very up close and graphic, as we see this man's head slowly disintegrate under the blows of a big fire extinguisher. Then we flash back to a series of scenes where we learn that these two guys are normal guys, who really aren't that street smart.  They're on a mission that we don't about yet and are getting help from some mafia-type street thugs, and a tip from a street prostitute is what led them to the club after ""La Tapia"".  Then we flash back to a party where these two guys are having varying degrees of fun, and one of them fights with his girlfriend(Bellucci), and she decides to go home by herself.  She starts to try to find a cab or bus or something, but another woman outside tells her to take the tunnel because it's safer.  That's when we see a very graphic depiction of a most heinous violation of the human body that seems to go on forever, with the perpetrator commentating(taunting) the whole time.  Another reviewer said people walked out of the theater he saw it at.  I can understand that as this is not the normal Hollywood depiction of this act.  This scene could not be shot as it is here and get even an NC-17 rating from the MPAA.

The rest of the movie shows the life these three lead, and the hope that pervades their lives and relationships.  What this film makes the viewers feel will be different for everyone, I beleive.  I felt a profound sense of sadness at the end, seeing the couple as they lived and went about their life as a happy couple, knowing that it would turn out to be the worst day of their lives.  The two romantic leads were together in real life at the time this movie was filmed, and it shows in their apartment scene together.

This film was mentioned to me as something that would shock and disgust me.  But at the end of the movie, I felt neither shock nor disgust.  Like I said above, I felt sad for the characters.  This movie was much better than I thought it would be.  I recommend it to adults who think they might like the story, or who're deadened to main stream Hollywood fare and want something different.",1129248000,4,3395,4.309148264984227

1875125,4,B00008YNI2,"This is a film that many will not want to watch.  Early on, I came as close as I ever do to turning a film off for any reason other than sheer boredom.  We are presented with a chaotic whirlwind of sound, light,profanity, and suggestive body placement as two men (Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel) frantically search for someone called Le Tenia (Jo Prestia) in an S&M club, capped off with a stunningly graphic (and technically impressive) sequence in which a man's head is beaten in repeatedly with a fire extinguisher in one long, seemingly unbroken shot.  All of this appeared to serve no purpose, just vile, ugly behavior below the level of an animal.  I was sickened.

But I stayed with it and I'm glad I did.  It soon became apparent that the story was unfolding in reverse.  As director Gaspar Noe follows his characters back to the beginning of this nightmarish evening--through an even more horrific and graphic rape scene, also presented in a single, unblinking take--and even earlier, we are able to process the violence.  It becomes the tragic shadow that hangs over the lives of three likeable people (Cassel, Dupontel, and the beautiful Monica Belluci) and forces us to contemplate our own lives.  A similarly tragic shadow may hang over any one of us, but we are blessed with ignorance; otherwise, our lives would be unliveable.

1875143,4,B00008YNI2,"The movie takes it's trick from Memento, a good movie that used it's reverse timeline as more visual trickery than as an integrated plotline.

Here, Gaspar Noe does a better job and the movie Irrevisible would not work nearly as well if it moved linearly in time.

The movie starts off with two men being arrested in a gay sex bar and they are accused of some unnamed horrendous crime (the bystanders are yelling at them). As the movie moves backwards, we see what that crime is and what motivated them to commit such a horrendous act. The main character is Marcus, a philandering alpha male that seems to react on forces that are thrown at him. He is unpredictable, reckless and works on emotion exclusively. His counterpart is Pierre, who is rational, more philosophical and tends to think things through. That makes him more boring and neurotic as well (A la Woody Allen), but they feed off each other well as the bloody crescendo reaches it's climax as they search for a rapist named La Tenia, who raped Alex (female) who is Marcus' lover and Pierre's ex girlfriend.

As the movie starts off, the camera angles are wild and unpredictable and could get nauseating at times. As the movie progresses (or regresses), it becomes more stable because the scenes becomes less violent, less gratuitous, more innocent. It's a good tool that is used because it makes Noe's statement of time destroying all things more relevant. This is same for the music, where in the beginning it is violent, electronic, wild and then ends up being soothing, classical.

The actors do a good job at their roles, especially Monica Bellucci who plays Alex. She has a central role, which involves a 10 minute rape scene. IT is hard to watch and must have been horrendous to film, since there is no editing involved. HOwever, the cast is not given much to work with and they are given just a few emotions to deal with (pierre is rational and idological, Marcus is dominant and irrational and Alex is the passive gf). Marcus and Alex do have good chemistry (Bellucci and Cassel are a real life couple) which makes what is to happen all that much more painful to watch.

I believe Gaspar Noe (this is the first movie of his I've seen) has great potential, as did Bryan Singer, John Woo, David Fincher before moving on bigger, but not always better things and I hope his next movie is as good as Irreverisible.

The DVD has an excellent transfer and has amazing sound. The extras are lacking though, other than a couple of trailers, a short film (boring) and two vignettes that seem like they were afterthoughts because of the lack of a ""making off"".

I did like how they explain the beating to death scene in the SFX section. It was the most realistic I have ever seen on film.",1120694400,6,2749,4.59795918367347
1875144,4,B00008YNI2,"I don't know many who have heard of this film and the ones who have are only familiar with it because of the much talked about acts of extreme violence during the film's climaxes. Because these particular acts are pretty realistic and shocking to those not desensitized to unflinching film violence, many are turned off and will not sit down to view this feature. While this is understandable, and while it can be justified, it is too bad because the film is actaully pretty well made.

Having seen Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' prior to 'Irreversible', I had the assumption it would be a foreign version of a familiar plot (the credits rolled backward, some letters were reversed, etc). Then, while viewing it, I begin to notice the unique style, flair, and an intriguing swagger the film starts to show.

As in 'Memento', the film begins with its brutality in the beginning, and to see why it is happening is the key. Some of this review will give away parts of the film, so if you have yet to see it, I don't wish to spoil anything for you, so consider yourself warned.

The camera work starts off erratic, blurry, and constantly moving, like a fly trying to avoid the swatter. The color pallette is heavily saturated, most notably with a lot of red, which help create the unsettling and violent mood, and there is a significant amount of chaos. As the film progresses, the camera slows down, becomes more steady, clear, and comprehensible. The colors are still vibrant, but they are more soothing and create a peaceful, harmonious feel.

A wicked soundtrack accompanies this film. The eerie opening drone in The Rectum (the club) sounds like something David Lynch would use in his films. Like the camera work, the soundtrack starts off horrifying and uneasy, then begins its unwinding towards the end of the film, and ultimately becomes quite soothing.

While this may seem like a rehashing of such an original idea as 'Memento', there are a few notable differences that set it apart. In 'Memento' there is a narratation by Guy Pearce (great job in that film, by the way) to sort of help the viewer along to understand the story, the situation, and the justification and explaination of certain key events. 'Irreversible' offers none of that; the viewer is almost like that fly on the wall, looking in and trying to figure out what the hell is going on. This also seemingly justifies the violent scenes (I don't intend to offend anyone by saying any violence of this nature is justified, but for the film's purposes...). As brutal as the opening murder is, after watching the rape, if that was my girlfriend, I would probably have the same spontaneous, uncontrollable lust for revenge.

Another thing I find interesting is the very end, when Alex is in her sun dress with her hand on her seemingly pregnant belly, and the scene shifts to the blue sky, orchestra, and relaxation on the beautiful green hill. Then the pretty sky fades into a static-like pulse that brings upon the conclusion of the film. Is it a dream? Is this entire film a dream? It would be nice if it is.

After thinking about it some more, though, I am leaning towards it is Alex as she succumbes to her injuries, since she is found in a coma. Maybe it is Alex fighting for survival, as she holds on to the peaceful feeling in order to keep her life. Maybe it is her last vision before dying, her life as it flashes before her eyes, maybe her intrepretation of heaven, maybe her entrance into heaven. I am not certain, but it's something to think about.

As in the title of this review, this film is overall a well made picture once (and if) you can get past the shock value. Enjoy being the fly on the wall, because you will never ever forget that you are one of the people to have watched 'Irreversible'.

I will most likely check out 'I Stand Alone', although I heard it is not quite as good. And I love how pedestrians are about as useless as they are ignorant.

Now the squeemish may loose thier lunch for other reasons such as man sex, brutal beatings, rape and trany dick but for those of us who are fascinated by things we haven't seen before you will find this movie thrilling.  Im going to play the role here of dumb American and admit that it took me a few scenes to figure out what the hell was going on and try and figure out who was who but by the time i had it figured out i really began to enjoy what was going on here.  The dialogue in parts is a little lengthy and drawn out (train scene) but so much of the film is the exact opposite where it sends you whirling through some wild parts of life you and I will never see and its for those scenes that i applaud the film.  I won't say this is a great movie because it is anticlimactic and because it plays backwards you don't feel anything for the characters when you should be feeling something for or about them but i will say this about the film .... if watching it doesnt immediately make you want to watch it again then this was never the kind of movie for you in the first place.

1875147,1,B00008YNI2,"Having endured the inanities surrounding the simple plot of this movie, I do ask myself what difference viewing it has made to me. The answer is none.  There is no need to view a rape scene to be led to condemn this despicable act.  It always has been despicable.  There is no need to be introduced to the slimy world of sex clubs, homosexual or otherwise.  An unpolluted mind will do fine, thanks anyway.  I'm glad this shaky hand-held camera circus is fast receding from my mind, possibly helped by the (fortunately) ample shades of darkness inflicting most of the flick, which must have saved saved the director from making much sense.

I would advise potential viewers to beware of the movie industry's self-congratulatory movie reviews.  Who wouldn't do likewise?  I can only say, ""pull the other one!""",1117929600,11,807,4.797101449275362

I knew that this was a piece of fiction, but nonetheless I still breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the extras featuring the FX director. From the emotions spawned by watching this film I came to realize that a good film doesn't have to be something that makes you FEEL good. A good film should make us realize something about ourselves. And I tell you that I never want to feel the way I felt after watching that rape scene! Because I did get a taste of the type of REGRET and rage that the significant other of a rape victim might feel, I will take precautions to ensure nothing like that happens to my baby. The fact that the rape scene took about 10 minutes is supposed to illustrate just how quickly a person's life can be turned upside down. That was a long ten minutes to the viewer(and the victim), but what is ten minutes to anyone not involved?

1875149,3,B00008YNI2,"This movie is indeed provocative and disturbing.

If I lived my whole life without seeing the brutality and groteque human behavior depicted in this movie, then I would not have considered my life incomplete.

But I have seen the stuff in the film that some loathe, but others accept, and - yes - their effects are ""irreversible."" Maybe even traumatic.

If you are thinking of buying this film, then I recommend that you watch the special features first -- more specifically the ""SFX"" section -- because it will prepare you for the gruesome scenes that ambush the viewer in the beginning of the film.

I personally could not watch one character bashing in another's head with a fire extinguisher (I covered my eyes, even though that kind of violence can sort of be seen on TV shows like MaxX) - and Monica Bellucci's rape and subsequent beating were particularly horrific.

After the film was over, I had to remind myself that it was only craft. And having one of the principles explain its special effects techniques reminded me that it was just acting and photography and computer effects.

Ultimately, was this all sound and fury signifying nothing? I think it did mean something. Like good art, this film is about making its audience THINK and FEEL about things we like to deny exists in the world - particularly man's inhumanity to other men and women. The world is not a pleasant place. Evil exists.

And Gaspar Noe the provocateur and enfant terrible makes it all painfully clear.

Will I watch this movie again? Probably not.

Will I recommend it to other people? I wil probably talk about it and tell people how gut wrenching it is.

1875150,5,B00008YNI2,"IRREVERSIBLE is a film shown backwards, scene by scene, that ends in extreme violence (the beginning).  It gradually unwinds to reveal the plot, back pedalling, rather than developing it.  Cinematography is used in a dizzying, turbulent way to accentuate the more intense scenes, and the soundtrack at times also seems to be cutting with nauseous spirals or synthetic organ music.  I'm sure you've read by now, there is a rape scene, and to make the retaliation of such seem more real, Monica Bellucci, who plays the victim, was actually in a relationship with Cassel, the macho, vengeful boyfriend in the movie.  The dialogue was more or less improvised for good or ill.  It doesn't wear on me much if it is bad since I don't speak french, but it was more than functional from my perspective.

When I first saw this movie, I reacted, thinking that it was blatant shock value, which would have been fine, but upon a second viewing, I started to realize how much attention to detail there was in the film.  There was a great deal of trouble taken to show the camera whirling in and out of a cab during an urgent scene, to build nerves better.  There was a mechanism to help the camera spin around as a segway to different scenes or in chase scenes.  The plot is littered with little details that give more weight to the centerpiece of the movie, the rape, and give momentum to the reminder: ""Time Destroys All Things"".  Aside from the obvious ""We All Will Die Someday"" and the like, part of the intention in showing the movie backwards, scene by scene, was to depict how one can forget such brutal situations as they are replaced by beautiful ones, according to the director, Gaspar Noe.

There's other details that I really appreciate about the movie, but you either get it or you don't.  I was about to brush off the movie after first view, until someone pointed out a little tidbit from the plot that I missed, so I watched it again.  Now it seems I'm constantly defending my opinion against people who don't seem to think much of the subtleties due to their reluctance to overlook that which is not-so-subtle, whether it be mentally or emotionally.",1114473600,2,2151,4.628947368421053
1875151,3,B00008YNI2,"I gotta admit, before I even viewed this film I already had my review in mind.  And, wouldn't you know it, what I expected to see in this film, is exactly what I saw, and what I now intend to say are almost exactly the sam thing e as what I expected to write of this film.  So maybe my view is tainted.  But I don't think so.  It's difficult to imagine a film that could more easily be described then 'Irreversible', a film which is the absolute height of pretension: This film is supremely arty, but not remotely complex.  It sometimes displays great artistry and technical precision, is sometimes flatly asinine, and is always cheap and manipulative.  And while I can't say that I really found it to be terribly disturbing, I'll admit that 'Irreversible' is about as unsettling as any film I've seen. I'm not very readily effected by violence in films, so lots of people will probably find this movie very powerful.  But, just because a film effects doesn't make it great, or even good.  It may just be being cheap, which is what this film is doing.

The plot is utter simplicity.  Boyfriend (Marcus) and Girlfriend (Alex) go to a party, they fight, Girlfriend leaves, gets severely raped and beaten, so Boyfriend and Ex-Boyfriend go out seeking revenge, and get it.  The end.  Most famously, this film is shown in reverse chronological order, thus adding phony depth to this simplistic plot, along with the even more simplistic moral which is verbally stated in the film: Time destroys everything.  Frankly, I've never been terribly impressed by the whole showing films out of chronological order, as it is a cheap tactic.  I'm not opposed to cheap tactics in and of themselves, but I do dislike them when they are used to make some big statement, when the filmmaker thinks he's being so very smart by using them.  Noe is cheap here, because the thematic justification for showing the film backwards is weak.  Showing the film backwards simply allows Noe to deprive us of important information,  just because it would be more powerful let us know this stuff at the end.  This is different from the most famous backward movie, 'Memento' which does justify the structure by having a main character with no short term memory, thus making the reverse order the best way to put ourselves in his position.  Or look at a film like 'Kill Bill', which is shown out of order to simply manipulate the audience, but this is acceptable because that is a deliberately shallow film, with no purposes other than entertainment.  I'll allow you to be cheap when were just trying to have fun, but not in an art house film.  That, and showing it in reverse order doesn't really add much anyway.  Yes, it allows us to see just how everything had to come together for the final events to occur, but you could have seen that plenty well showing it in chronological order,  You'd just have to think a little.  That and he uses some incredibly lame tactics, such as when Alex talks about a book she's reading which says that the future is already written, or talks about her dream in a red tunnel.  Ooh, you are a clever one Noe.  (though I hear the dialogue was generally improvised, so maybe Bellucci came up with this crap on her own.  I dunno.)  Of course, if he had shown it in chronological order have the audience would've walked out anyway, but from boredom rather than offense.  More on that later.

Stylistically, this film is a mixed bag.  Sometimes the wild camera movements and extremely long takes are impressive, sometimes they are obnoxious.  This is particularly notable at the beginning of the film, where the camera is flailing around with utter abandon.  This is somewhat disorienting, but it's mostly just obnoxious and taken to utterly ridiculous extremes.  Note the opening scene, where to characters just sit in a room, talking, while the camera wanders around at random, focusing on the light fixtures or the corner or whatever.  Though I'll admit, this does work well for contrast, as the violent scenes are typical shown with very, very little camera movement, as is the second half of the film, which takes place before the tragic events shown earlier.

This films reputation is actually deserved, as far as graphic violence is concerned.  The arm-breaking scene is extremely painful, and the face-pulverization with the fire extinguisher is probably the most brutal piece of violence I've ever seen in a film.  And, the rape is very nasty too, and, to Noe's credity, it is shot in such a way so as to be as inexploitive as possible considering how extremely intense it is.  (i.e. nudity is kept to a minimum)  These scenes are effective, but much of the rest of the film is asinine.  The scenes at the party and just before it are quite boring, and really don't give us all that much information on the characters.  The endless dialogue between Pierre, Marcus and Alex, mostly prattling on and on about sex in some fashion or another, is spectacularly tedious.  In some ways, these scenes take away from the later scenes, as Marcus proves to be an utterly loathsome prick, not worthy of any sympathy, though he is redeemed somewhat by the opening scene between him and Alex, which is probably the only scene in the second half of the movie which is truly worthwhile.

As far as I can tell, I'm virtually impossible to offend, but you can irritate me.  And, just about the best way to irritate me is to *try* and be offensive.  Virtually all of the
'extreme' cinema I've seen seems to be catered towards the interests of those who can watch this sorta thing.  It will offend or disturb many people, but it's not made for this purpose.  Personally, the graphic nature of this film just seems like it was meant to offend mainstream audiences, and, if possible, offend even the core audience.  Why I get this impression from this film is difficult to pinpoint, but there's little doubt in my mind that I'm correct.  That's probably my biggest beef with this movie.

1875152,3,B00008YNI2,"The ironic part is; in ""contradiction"" to the movies' title ""Irreversible"" the story here is being told backwards -and it's because of such a chaotic, violent and grotesque opening sequel that finds place somewhere in the underworld somewhere on a street in some French town (an ""earthly"" hell would be the proper description) that makes a party where people are happy, and on drugs (!), well, suddenly that seems so normal. The rape of Monica Belluccis' character is a long and speculative(?) scene -not that rape is anything but a horrible and violent crime, but the scene... well, I don't know what to say. You would like to strangle that man -and the way the opening of the movie introduce you to his dreadful fate, let's just say that you don't feel sorry for him anymore.

The problem with the movie is the lenght of what happens before the rape, which again is the ending of the movie becoming a bit unintersting -and the couple that is supposed to be presentated as such a normal couple, well, we don't need that. The rape-scene would have been frightening anyway, and you would have felt just as sorry for the girl even if you hadn't known anything about her ""ability of discussing orgasm with an old boyfriend infront of her new one"". I didn't quite see the use of that. I don't think I will watch this movie again, but it's anything but a bad movie.

I think this is the most horrible thing I have ever seen in a movie.  This scene makes the rape in I Spit On Your Grave seem timid by comparison.  (Even the notorious razor-blade rape in the Stendahl Syndrome is comparitively tame.)

The film leaves an indelible, sickening impression right away-- in fact, many such impressions. It is so horrifying, so unbelievable and graphic that it is hard to watch but also impossible to turn away. The violence that unfolds as siren-like music plays, camera angles spin, red and darkened lighting, truly dizzying and nauseating-inducing atmosphere coupled with the tension and constant ominous feeling throughout-- something is always just about to go wrong.

The story is told in reverse, much like Memento, and the most gory sights come almost right away in the film. The most painful and difficult to watch scenes (perhaps the longest, most brutal and uncomfortable rape scene in cinematic history) are midway through the film and along with it comes the slow and numbing realization that what was supposed to constitute ""justice"" and ""revenge"" at the beginning of the film was senseless and misdirected.

I found the ending or shoud I say the beginning powerful yet bittersweet because Marcus himself didn't get his revenge personally.

1875179,2,B00008YNI2,"I did not like this film but not because of the subject matter.  I've seen more graphically intense and unsettling films than this.  There were several things with Irreversible that didn't sit well with me.  First is the concept of running the film backwards. It's been done before and to much better effect with Memento.  Second, the camera angles were annoying.  Swirling and twirling the camera in all directions is ok for about fifteen minutes but an entire film's worth of this kind of pretentious tomfoolery is something you would expect a first year film student to do.  Third, Irreversible is yet another entry in the recent new wave of sexually graphic French films, simple excuses for directors to indulge in graphic sex and violence with very little story or character development.  None of Irreversible's characters are likeable.  They all impulsively act out in the dumbest way possible.  Marcus is a cokehead jerk who is more concerned about revenge than his possibly dead girlfriend.  Pierre is a pathetic loser pining after Alex, his ex-girlfriend. If he disliked Marcus so much then why did he tag along?  And Alex was just plain stupid.  What woman in her right mind, no matter how angry she is, would leave a party in the middle of the night wearing a dress that fits her like a second skin and walk by herself through a grimy, dimly lit underground pedestrian walkway that even I would be frightened to walk through?  And why doesn't she fight back when she's attacked?  Her attacler had his knife in hand only for a few moments.  Alex's hands were free during most of the attack.  She could have kicked, screamed, bit, gouged, scratched, anything at all.  Instead, she acquiesces by not putting up much of a struggle at all.  It was hard for me to feel sympathetic for her or any of the other characters.  I was also a bit put off that Irreversible does not present gays in a very positive light.

I get the reference of heaven/hell and time destroys all things that Noe is trying to make but ultimately I think this was a self-indulgent exercise in seeing how far he could go in making an audience squirm.  Irreversible is an unnecessarily gratuitous and graphic film.  I can understand how some can view this as powerful and necessary, but I came away feeling like it was weak and pointless.

I keep reading reviews stating that the assailant was brutally murdered by Pierre in the revenge scene. If you didn't catch the very last shot of the true rapist, staring bewilderedly at Pierre, then you haven't gotten the full message of the film. The rapist did NOT die at the end of the film (although, I'll admit, the poor sob that lost his face DID look a whole lot like the tenia...). I didn't catch this the first time around, but after I finished it, I went back to that scene and watched closely. He's even wearing the same necklace. My guess is that the tenia was in that back room that those two thugs were standing in front of (guarding?). During all of the commotion, he must have come out to witness the murder, realizing that it was meant for him. That look in the last take of the scene says it all...you can even see a smile creeping into that look of disbelief. Obviously, this makes the overall message far bleaker than if he had truly had his face beaten in (which he most definately deserved). Knowing that the most despised character in the movie is the only one that truly comes out unscathed...THAT is what makes this movie so disturbing.

Personally I loved this film....if you can use ""love"" to describe a movie that battered me, sickened me, mesmerized me, drained me and left me feeling as if I had been kicked in the gut.

The theme of ""time destroys everything"" is not new in the world of art. It is a concept that becomes frighteningly real to us as we get older. In this film, Gasper Noe shows us the tragic outcome of a series of events before allowing us to view these events in reverse chronological order. By doing so he has given us a god's eye view over the lives of the main characters. This gives the subsequent scenes an ever deepening sense of irony and despair, more than a conventional storyline could ever hope to achieve. It also gives the audience a deep sense of personal despair...for even though we know what's going to happen, we remain powerless to intervene. Time destroys everything, and it is unstoppable.

Much has been said regarding the explicit sex and violence as well as the spinning camerawork at the film's beginning. There is no gratuitous exploitation here...what we are forced to witness is raw, realistic and merciless. We may long to run away from the horror and pretend it isn't there, much like the faceless witness in the tunnel (a brilliant device), but when we open our eyes it is still there. In a genre where sex and violence have become commonplace these scenes will shake-up all but the most jaded moviegoer.

The camerawork was also essential for it expertly mirrors the turmoil of the characters. As the film opens all is chaos...emotions are past the breaking point and mindless brutality rules the mind. The camera swoops and spins, rolls and ducks, it is completely unbalanced and out of control....a sign of intense control on behalf of the director. The lighting is dark, the colours lurid. Compare this to the long, sunny takes towards the end of the film (and the beginning of the story).

This is not a simple story told backwards...rather, it is a meditation on fate, destiny, and free will. Is our future already written? Are our actions pre-determined?

""Irreversible"" is a cinematic Memento Mori that I look forward to seeing again and again. 10/10 (or for amazon's sake 5/5).",1108512000,4,2443,4.804761904761905

First, I thought, This guy doesn't know how to make a movie. (I had never seen a movie by director Noe.) Then I realized it was running from end to beginning.

After that, there was the killing scene. But first, Marcus had his arm broken. That was obviously a prop and the break looked too easy. A downer. If you want to be violent, do it more realistically. Ooops! Then the killing scene with a fire extinguisher. Well, two blows were enough, I thought. Six? Okay. Sounds good. TWENTY-THREE? That was too much. I was mesmerized, because there must have been a good reason.

Then, the ultra-long rape scene. I was nauseated. To tell you the truth, I am an advocate of the death penalty for rapists and this film confirmed my feelings.

Monica Bellucci is one incredible actress to put that performance the way she did. I do not believe there are many ladies who can do that type of scene. She is fantastic. Not to mention the difficulty of the whole episode. It was incredible.

Im not ""faint hearted""... but this... this was borderline traumatising. The images are stuck in my head as I write. I hired the DVD cause Belluci was in it and there was nothing else to see. So im sitting there with a few mates... and bam!... this thing just hits us like a tonne of bricks.

The beginning almost made me throw up... and it hadnt even started yet... the camera swirls around until you feel real nausea... and just when you're about to dry reach... this guy gets his arm snapped in half... and before you can squint... another man gets his face bashed violently.... Now i don't mean... bashed until his bloodied and bruised... I mean his maxilla (face) caves in, and his brain comes out... It looked so realistic... my heart was honestly pounding...

The next few minutes was a blur... I was debating with the guys to just turn it off. I wish we did... then came a gruesome 10 minute rape scene... stuff I frankly don't care to see... And just when you think its all over and you're picking what's left of your sanity off the floor... the guy beats Belluci until her face is splatterred across the concrete.

The rest of the movie is pointless.

Its documentary style 'tell it like it is'... is too much.. its traumatsiing... this needs to be communicated... specially when the DVD is creeping up onto shelves all over video stores right about now with Belluci looking seductive as ever on the front cover.

There is no point for us to analyse/discuss the moral/social/philosophical issues behind this movie... because its too traumatic, and depressing to think about. It sucks you so deep into its turmoil that you become a victim of it, rather than an outside observer.

Last time I felt like this, was when I stupidly witnessed an Iraqi beheading clip. And really, in hindsight, how different is this from that expirience. And why would I want to expirience it. We spend our lives trying to avoid and protect ourselves from such horrible encounters. We know its bad. Are you pleople that bored with your lives that you need to resort to watching snuff.  (Some people cut themselves to induce emotion). Are we at a point in time where mankind welcomes and embraces this kind of assault onto oneself for mere excitement\entertainment.

Watching A movie is like needles pinching nerve and muscle tendons, to inspire some sort of emotion. It can be relaxing, atmoshperic, thought provoking, entertaining. This movie is like a knife straight through the heart. Maybe I've still got a bit of life left in me to NOT need this sort of adrenaline pumping through my veins.",1106956800,76,3028,4.644859813084112
1875198,5,B00008YNI2,"After notorious walkouts at Cannes and the controversy around the difficult, long, unrelenting rape scene, this was high on my must-see list of the last year. Not for voyeuristic reasons, but because, like A Clockwork Orange before it, the most controversial films are often those with the most to say.

This is not a date movie. Nor is it a pleasant, enjoyable experience. It is, however, pure cinema from a director working at the highest technical level, with the camera, with lighting, with makeup, with scripting and with performance.

Irreversible is that rare beast, a self-contained experience which goes beyond the cinematic and aesthetic to show something real, both touching and frightening, beautiful and horrific, simple and innovative. The first twenty minutes are among the toughest you will encounter on the screen. The sound whines and hums, the camera spins in all directions, disorientating and showing glimpses of the scene. Dialogue is sparse, the same lines being repeated over and over again. The subject matter is unpleasant, taking place in a seedy gay club, the protagonists (Dupontel and Cassel) searching for someone called the Tenia (named after a tape-worm). And when they find him, there is a sequence which lasts maybe two minutes which is incredibly difficult to watch, yet difficult not to watch. Almost in disbelief, you cannot believe what you are watching is happening, yet marvel at how real it is, both technically and in terms of human character.

Beyond that, the film does not let up for about another half an hour, as the backwards-played story begins to piece itself together, leading to an act of provocation unrivalled in cinema history. It is the details of the rape that make it so shocking - her constant crying and squirming, his inherent joy at her discomfort, his pinning of her arms and gagging her mouth, the passer-by who sees the scene and walks away, unbeknownst to either of them. And when the long, unsettling scene is over, the greatest act of destruction occurs - the destruction of purity and beauty. Yet, as the film is told backwards, when the rape is over, we know there is more to come as we have already seen the aftermath. The brilliance is in naively praying it won't happen, resigned to the knowledge that it will.

 Without following the film through to the end(or the beginning), we would not know the reason that the director put these scenes in front of us. For me the greatest scenes are those that follow - the party scene, the subway journey of the three main characters, the post-dream awakening of the central couple - because they lift the film out of enfant terrible provocation and into a place of simultaneous beauty and pessimism, making sense of the journey all three characters are about to embark on. In particular the significance of dreams is a key theme, along with the linear, destructive power of time which the whole film is playing around with.

The film ends with the most difficult sequence to watch, the spinning beautiful image of Monica Bellucci prior to any of the events of the film followed by a strobe light effect which is physically difficult to watch, burning images and words into the brain.

Clearly Noe is a director intent on provoking a reaction and - thank God - it is impossible not to react to this film. You may hate it, you may admire it or you may be disgusted by it. All of these are perfect reactions to it. You cannot be indifferent to it. While it is undoubtedly a hard film to sit through, if you put in the effort it rewards in dividends. And it not only deserves but really requires multiple viewings, if you can stomach it. There is far more than can be taken in on the first visit, much to decipher and interpret that I will not spoil here.

While it does seem to reference the controversy of the aforementioned Kubrick classic - taking the violence and sexual abuse aspects to new levels, updating for a new generation - and even directly tips its hat to Kubrick - panning down from a poster of 2001 as classical music swells, before going into a psychadelic head-trip - this is a much harder, yet more humane film than Kubrick ever achieved. There is unpleasantness here, do not be fooled, but there is also insightful comment on the nature of humanity, instinct, violence, even love and relationships which alone makes the film worthy of appreciation. It is not a film all will be able to sit through - for a start, its subtitled! - but it is a film which deserves to be seen at least once by anyone with an appreciation of cinema. It is among the finest examples of modern French cinema available and one of the most intelligent and original films from anywhere in the last five years.

Finally, it wouldn't be right to hail the film without mentioning the performers. Monica Bellucci is outstanding in an undoubtedly difficult part, conveying the beauty, intelligence, womanliness, emotion and despair of Alex in a way that never screams ""Moviestar!"" and is always believable. Dupontel is wonderful in perhaps the film's most interesting role, a complex intellectual who, it is often overlooked, gives in to his most primal urges. He is sad, smart, witty and ultimately disturbed. But highest praise goes to Cassel, one of the most interesting actors working, who carries most of the film, emitting charm, energy, fear, shock, humour and weakness. It is hard not to focus on him in any given scene and impossible to catch him acting, high praise indeed given the other subjects which often fill the screen (not least the stunning Bellucci). Together, they are prime examples of true actors giving themselves over completely to their characters in a way that the likes of Nicole Kidman simply can't. They may be stars, but they are first and foremost brilliant performers.

1875201,3,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible (Gaspar Noe, 2002)

The best thing about Irreveresible is watching this film and knowing Monica Bellucci would, a few months after its release, be playing Jesus' favorite hooker. There's a cruel irony to it that is obviously unintentional on Noe's part, but that resonates regardless.

That said, there has been a huge amount of hype surrounding this movie since its debut a few years ago at Cannes. Quite simply, said hype is about as accurate as it was for Cidade de Deus; while there is one scene, very early in the film, that is, truly, the most violent thing I've seen in any mainstream cinema outside Takashi Miike, neither the violence in the rest of the film nor the infamous rape scene is nearly as harrowing as the media, and many other critics, have made it out to be. It's still not for the weak of stomach, by any means, but it's not something to go out of your way to avoid for those reasons, either.

For that matter, there really isn't all that much violence in the rest of the film; most of it is contained within the rape scene. (This should not be surprising.) As for the rape scene itself, it is (mercifully) shorter, and far less brutal, than some filmed decades before (exploitation ""classic"" I Spit on Your Grave immediately comes to mind).

With all that out of the way, how's the rest of the film? Not bad, but not all that great, either. The movie opens with two men, Marcus (Vincent Cassel, who played Gilles de Rais in the horrid Joan of Arc flick The Messenger) and Pierre (A Very Long Engagement's Albert Dupontel), running through a gay club looking for a man they know only as Le Tenia (The Tapeworm). The scene ends with Le Tenia's murder, and the rest of the film details the events leading up to it. Cassel, Dupontel, and Monica Bellucci all turn in good performances, and despite the fact that most of the movie was improvised (the original draft from which Noe shot was reportedly only three pages long), there are some very well-done parallels in the film that take excellent advantage of the reverse-time convention the film follows (and do make the rape scene more disturbing, when considered at length afterwards).

The film's main problem is its camerawork. At the very beginning, the swirling handheld shots make for a good disorienting effect, but the cameraman simply didn't know when enough was enough; much of the film's ninety-minute length is shot in this same way, as if Noe handed the handheld to a person with extreme vertigo during much of the shooting. When your effort at disconcerting the viewers gets boring, you've gone too far. Also, it's obvious that some slip-ups were left in the film in order that the scenes would not have to be re-shot (Cassel, when his character is asked for his name, answers ""Vincent-- whoops! Just kidding."", for example), giving the whole thing a rather amateur feel to it that one doesn't expect from a director so well-known after his first film (not to mention so well-backed; the list of producers for this movie as almost as long as the cast).

One other thing, though. Special attention should be given to an excellent piece of comic relief provided by musician and performance artist Costes in the opening scene (he's listed in the credits as ""fistman."" You'll know him as soon as he opens his mouth.) Costes is a funny, thoroughly twisted guy, and he shows it very well in this role. Those aware of Costes already shouldn't be put off by the film's subject matter, so if you're a fan, it's defintely worth watching-- the first twenty-five minutes, anyway.

Not a film about which it's really possible to say ""I liked it,"" but I appreciate some of the deeper resonances of what Noe was trying to do. See it, as long as you're not put off by sex and violence, and judge for yourself. ** ",1104883200,10,3793,4.650746268656716

1875215,3,B00008YNI2,"Why does No one who`s reviewed this film, make mention that the guy who raped ALEX got away with it?...It was NOT him who got his head crushed with the fire extinguisher!! right after the final blow...the camera pans on the one who did the rape!.Look at the clothes, or his face!",1102982400,5,279,4.384615384615385
1875216,1,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible tells the story of Alex, the victim of a brutal rape and beating in a Paris underpass, and Alex's lover Marcus and ex-lover/friend Pierre, [...] in search of ""the tapeworm""; the pimp who assaulted her. The story is told in reverse, beginning with Pierre and Marcus being led from the club by police, and working back through the assault that set these events in motion and finally to Marcus and Alex earlier that day, unaware of what's about to transpire.

I'll start with the ""marquee"" scene in the film (the rape/assault), since this is what most people who rent or buy ""Irreversible"" are going to want to see. I can admit that images of rape can be very erotic on film, and I think that the amount of fantasy-rape porno online and on film pretty much proves that this is a turn-on for a fair number of men (and some women).

But this scene did nothing for me. There is virtually no nudity. It's brutal, but not particularly graphic. I didn't find it any more shocking than the rape in ""Straw Dogs"" (an infinitely better film) and it's less stomach-churning than similar scenes in ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" ""The Accused,"" ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" and a lot of other movies.

The big problem is that the scene isn't designed to titillate (especially since it ends with a brutal beating that couldn't excite any viewer) OR deal with the subject of rape in an intelligent way. In fact, since the story is told backwards we first meet Alex a few moments before the assault, so you only sympathize with her character in the way you'd sympathize with anyone who's a victim of a horrible crime. The backwards style of the movie works against ""Irreversible,"" because the viewer doesn't get to know or identify with Alex at all until she's already beaten to a pulp.

At this point, I figured that we'd move back in time to get to know Alex, Marcus and Pierre; to identify with their characters and appreciate the horrible events (prior to the rape, we see Pierre beat the supposed assailant to death with a fire extinguisher in a scene that's IMO much harder to take that the rape). But that never really comes. We learn that Marcus likes to do coke and fool around with other women at parties while his girlfriend is nearby. We learn that Pierre is a wimp who likes to ask his ex-girlfriend sexually explicit questions about their former love life in front of her current boyfriend. We learn that Alex is hot, and that she's the type of girl who would date a jerk like Marcus. These are characters I'm supposed to care about?

Throughout it all we get a swirling, panoramic camera that only settles down like a voyeur to focus on images of rape, murder or gratuitous nudity. I'm sure the director used this technique to mimic the turning passage of time or something, but personally I found it more disorienting and unpleasant to watch than innovative. I'll give him points for running the end credits at the beginning of the movie, though; that was clever.

Overall, my biggest impression at the end of the movie is, ""that's it?"" Almost nothing happens. If you played ""Irreversible"" back-to-front, it would go like this: Alex sits in a park looking pretty. Alex and Marcus frollic naked and talk about things we don't care about. Alex, Marcus and Pierre talk about sex on a train. They go to a party. Alex is assaulted. Marcus and Pierre track the assailant down (I'm not sure if he actually was the assailant; neither do I care) and beat him to death. They're arrested. The end.

The director dresses the film up in swirling camera work and tells the story back-to-front to pawn it off as art-house fare that makes some point about the ""irreversible"" damage that some trauma (the rape and murder) inflicts on its characters. But ultimately, the movie is ""about"" watching a guy get beat to death by a fire extinguisher, and watching a hot girl get anally raped by a sleazeball. That's it.

I'm not going to get on my high horse and say this movie is ""immoral"" or ""disgusting."" I've seen films like ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""Salo: 100 Days of Sodom,"" so this kind of subject matter doesn't turn me off. But ""Irreversible"" makes the unpardonable sin of being boring, and at least the aforementioned movies have the integrity to admit they're exploitation and then deliver the goods. Not only is ""Irreversible"" not shocking, but it also thinks you're stupid enough to think it's deep.

Europeans' filmmakers really capture the essences of modern society's problems where Hollywood seems to stupefy things.  The independent low budget film has an edge to it.  Like another reviewer noted, the camera angle was very unstable.  I also felt dizzy for the first 5-10 minutes if it lasted any longer, I would have to turn it off.  (I got slight stigma in one eye and also can't play 3rd person video games)  The pictures' quality is almost all dark scenes and not very details due to the poor lightings and jumpy cameraman.  The acting is very creditable and scenes are provocative.

 Directing wise it takes Memento's directing style by taking scenes chronically later in the story line and splicing it backward toward the beginning.

It goes in segments back through time like Memento, with a similarly sadistic plot but more so. The three characters and their relationship are richly developed in a way that tells an interesting story, which feels 'profound' (and the framing of the movie emphasize its 'philosophical' quality). Its formal film-making heavy-handedly illustrates the regression through time from chaos (the camera and sound in the beginning are hard to endure) to pastoral, such that you see the seeds of chaos in the pastoral: the lovers in the hedonism of their happiness and the ex-boyfriend, a professor of some kind, in the way his 'philosophy' gives free rein to the masochism (and with it sadism) of his clinging to the lovers. The long takes are great, and are edited together digitally so that the whole movie seems to be one take, which isn't as great because it requires the camera twirling around into the sky a lot.

But when I think about it it occurs to me that neither people nor Paris is as chaotic as the movie wants to make a philosophical point of -- people follow lines of conversation and desire self-indulgently, but even on drugs or under great stress not as aggressively for as long as in the movie -- I doubt any parties are quite as hedonistic as that one, nor are there S & M clubs as alienating as that one nor any named 'Rectum' -- and pimps on their own street corner don't, I think, attack random women in sidewalk underpasses, rape them at great length and beat them into a coma.

A friend had me watch the movie when I was staying with him one weekend. Thinking I could take anything I agreed even after his warnings. How bad could this be? Boy was I wrong. From the opening shot of the old men talking above the s&m club, to the club itself. This movie did not stop. Every one who has given a review has pretty much given the plot outline, so I will not do that. What I will do is tell you that after seeing this film I didn't know if I hated it, or if it was my new favorite movie. I felt dirty for days and for being a man. I felt gulity for not turning away from the rape scene, but much like a car crash, you just have to keep watching. Irreverible is brilliant in sense that it is able to make you feel, and 99% of the time those feelings are not what you would expect from just a film. What is also so amazing about this movie is the soundtrack: the reverse bass that bumps and gets into your stomach. It is an all out attack on the senses. Sometimes isn't nice to be shocked though?

A follow up:
As a joke I asked for the film for Christmas from my polyanna at work. I did not think that I would really get it but I did. So, I came home and put it in my DVD player. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen it. I don't know what I was thinking, but I watched it alone; not the best idea. On my second viewing I noticed some things I had not the first time. What effected me wasn't what I had missed, but that upon my second time seeing the movie, it was still able to make me feel the same way it did the first time.

Unlike Memento (which I totally loved), Irreversible doesn't have two stories going on and then meet around the middle of the movie. It looks like scenes were filmed in order, but put in an inverse way. That results with credits as the beginning :) Also, that provides you a feeling you don't meet that often in movies nowadays: you always see the consequences before their causes. So you always know later why that thing you just saw happened. Brilliant.

Concerning the raw side of the movie. Well since lots of reviewers almost told you all the story of Irreversible (you're wise guys (ironic)), you surely know about those long violent scenes. I won't tell everything like some others made. I'll just tell you that, when you usually see that something reaaaally sick and bad and violent is gonna happen in a movie, most of time you see like a scary face and a shadow on the wall, or just a short short clip of the act...and then the camera stops. Well here, no shadow, no clip. The camera doesn't stop when it usually does. That says all.

About the actors. I never really liked Monica Belucci. But, in Irreversible, she handles her character like no other ever could. I really think she rocks now. For Vincent Perez, same thing. I always liked him, but wow...on every point, on every aspect (and that's the same for his male peer in the movie..can't remember his name) he's (they're) perfect! Great actors who give an outstanding performance...and actually said ""oui"" to play in this...I'd say...experimental movie...which surprised me (but in the best possible way).

Frenchies aren't good for comic movies...but Irreversible shows they rock at movies that traumatize people. You gotta give to Ceasar what is Ceasar's.

The former is a nauseating scene, in part because the camera is spinning out of control, that takes place inside an S&M club The scene is full of pornographic imagery and ends with a gruesome fight involving a fire extinguisher and somebody's face.  This combined with dialogue that sounds like prison vernacular times Penthouse Forum, only helped to add to the controversy surrounding the film and the number of people to walk out of theaters.  The rape scene takes place approximately in the middle of the film and lasts for ten minutes or more.  It is easily one of the most vicious scenes in film history; not for the faint of heart.  Apparently, the director wanted to try  top ""Salo""--known in film circles as the most disgusting film of all-time-- (the film is even mentioned in the opening/ending credits).  If not for that, it is possible that Noe would have been ""praised"" for treating the subject in such visceral way rather than the conservative manner that the other 99% of films do.

The second half of the film leads up to the course of events that lead to Alex's attack and the couple's relationship before all of that takes place.  In a lot of ways this is the most important part of the film, not just because it adds depth to the film but also because so many people walk out that they don't get a true feeling of what they went to see.  It is impossible to say how one will feel after viewing, or at least attemting to, this for the first time.  But I would highly recommend that if you're going to watch this, give it some thought first, so that if you chose to watch it, you'll watch it in its entirety and thereby know what you really think of it.",1096675200,3,2402,4.605633802816901
1875236,4,B00008YNI2,"Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible"" is undoubtedly one of the most intense films I've ever seen. It actually might be one of the most gut-churning films ever made. It's just unbelievable of what you're exposed to while watching this. ""Irreversible"" was a hit-or-miss in the theaters since many admired it and many dispised it. It was ranked the most walked out film (There were about 1,000 walk-outs) at Sundance. Yes, it's that bad. When I first heard about all the controversy and complaints about how violent ""Irreversible"" was, I sad to myself; ""How bad could it possibly be?"" But the hype was indeed correct. It's *that* bad.

With a reversed-told story somewhat reminisce of Christopher Nolan's brilliant and complex ""Memento,"" it's a no-holds-barred revenge story about 2 friends, Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre, who are in search of tracking down the man responsible for the rape and beating of Marcus's girlfriend, Alex (Monica Bellucci, Cassel's real-life spouse). It involves a long scene with the two in search of the rapist in a gay S&M club named The Rectum, with the dizzying hand-held camera movements and music.  The music made me sick. It's so hard to describle why but you would notice if you were watching the film. It was a bit controversial since critics labeled it as homophobic since it quickly shows numerous men blowing one another and screaming, ""Fist me! or ""Suck me!

The rape scene was frightening. It was shown for 9 minutes with no cuts at all. It's all one big long scene. She's sodomised for several minutes with La Tenia (the rapist) sweet-talking her in extremely vulgar and misogynistic comments, plus a very realistic beating to go along with it afterwards. He hammered her so bad that it left her comatose. But the scene that likely created the most walk-outs (Since the rape scene happened during the first hour) was another harrowing scene; the fire extinguisher beating, which occurs during the first 15 minutes of the film. Like the rape, the beating was shot in one single cut with the camera focusing on the victim's face being bashed (literally) so much to the point where there would be nothing left of his head.

I don't think there's many films more unpleasant than ""Irreversible."" It's quite honest on the crime of rape and it packs a powerful punch, especially when you see the last scene at the very end (or the beginning). But it's only recommended for a selected amount of viewers; it's so violent and you never see acts this cruel in film.",1096329600,7,2490,4.851764705882353
1875237,4,B00008YNI2,"We read headlines about rape and murder and these are just words, or worse yet statistics.  We live our lives insulated from such horrors, unless....unless we take the wrong street, or meet the wrong person on the wrong day in the wrong neighborhood or find ourselves in a situation spiraling wildly out of control.  And then, suddenly, shockingly our lives will never be the same.

If you've the stomach for it, Irreversible will bring that nightmare scenario right up front and center and shove it in  your face.  Three lives lived in pleasant middle-class gentility will be torn apart and, if not utterly destroyed, certainly forever horribly altered by a violent rape and the violence it engenders.

As noted by others, the film is presented in reverse order and is characterized by wildly spinning camera moves and similar creative flourishes, with the notable exception of the pivotal rape scene which is presented straight on in all it's horror and ugliness.  The opening of the film, plunging us into a gay S&M sex club presented as some lower ring of Dante's Inferno is disorienting, shocking and terrifying.  Working backward from the brutality we witness there, a story is pieced together that shows how savage act is followed by more savagery....and no justice for anyone involved.

This is the type of movie hard to recommend.  Many would not want to take this trip and I can understand that.  It is certainly not a film I would want to watch repeatedly either.  But, like Leaving Las Vegas and other films that show the uglier side of life, when done with passion and commitment they can be worth your time.

Shot in long takes, and apparently much improvised, the director and actors here are doing something more than just trying to shock you for exploitative reasons.  The language is as harsh and brutal as the visuals, showing how unbridled rage coarsens even usually civilized people.  It makes the later part of the movie even more poignant when we see tenderness and love and joking amongst them.

Not for everyone, if you aren't ready and interested in very tough material, give this a pass.  For those who dare, this is a challenging film that will haunt you for days.  It still lingers and resonates with me.",1095465600,7,2233,4.816272965879265

I'm no shrinking violet and adore Hong Kilm action films. A very ugly tale of revenge and brutality with plenty of gore. The rape scene was horrific and seemed to last forever - I ended up skipping this scene. I cannot believe this film garnered as much acclaim as it did.

There's graphic intensity, and then there's graphic exploitation. Irreversible (which as a lame play on words is told in a reverse chronological order) almost  always teeters on the brink of the latter, shocking for the sake of shocking, gory for the sake of being gory.

If voyeuristic fireworks is what you're after, at least real porn maintains the honesty of not hiding its true identity behind an artistic veneer. I regret that the colossal waste of time on this idiotic film is indeed irreversible.",1094688000,8,739,5.040983606557377
1875240,4,B00008YNI2,"After seeing this film I felt sick and nauseated, and because of this it is very hard for me to recommend this movie to anyone.  This movie features the most horrific murder scene in film history... period.  It also features an excruciatingly long and brutal rape scene (over 10 minutes) that is equally hard to watch.  Both are done with such graphic realism it is impossible to detect they are just an illusion.  The murder scene, in particular, is so realistic it still haunts me today.

So why am I giving this ""trash"" 4 stars?  Well, surprisingly this movie is far from it.  The acting and direction are both superb.  Irreversible also follows a Kubrick-like approach to filmmaking.  Both directors use the camera as a tool that allows the audience to simply observe what is going on at the particular moment.  You truly get the feeling you are a bystander watching what unfolds.  There is also a very meaningful scene towards the end where you see a poster of 2001 (Gaspar No must be a fan of Kubrick).

The structure is similar to Memento where it starts at the end and works its way back- one piece at a time.  In the beginning (or ending), the movie starts with a very dizzy camera approach showing a state of chaos that gradually settles down as the movie progresses to the end (or beginning).  If you are brave enough to attempt to watch this movie please don't let the camera work throw you!!!  It may seem annoying at first, but it is absolutely intentional.  You will get used to it and it does get better (I promise), and even during the dizzy moments it strategically slows down to a halt during key scenes before reverting again.  The camera work itself showcases the movie's tagline ""time destroys everything"" in how a state of being can radically change from wonderful peace and harmony to a tragic state of complete destruction.  This is a very shocking and disturbing film, and the experience will definitely stay with you... probably for the rest of your life.",1093651200,10,1982,4.630372492836676
1875241,5,B00008YNI2,"This is a disturbing film. The camera work and the editing are truly unique and masterfully handled. The acting is more than credible. Everything, put together as it was, makes "" Irreversible"" a haunting film - a juxtapostion of beauty and violence as I have never seen.

This is not something you watch for entertainment. It has lingered with me for days now. I won't dwell on any specifics, but the seedy underbelly of society and the violence that can be inflicted on one another is convincingly slammed into the viewer's face.

It can be difficult to read the subtitles and keep up with the visual onslaught. The camera work is fascinating and enhances the whole experience; I think I would have become nauseous, if I had seen "" Irreversible"" in the theater. The pacing is unrelenting and artistically disorienting, especially in the beginning.

This is a masterpiece, but it's not for your average viewing audience.",1093305600,8,920,4.884615384615385

  I'm not going to comment on the two imfamous scenes (except to say that the director succeeded in pulling them off and making us think)  rather I want to focus on the fact that movies are a changin' and people can't expect fairy tales all their lives.  Irreversible pushes the boundaries of adult content and simulated violence,  but in no way is this film exploitation fare.  The director (in reverse)  takes us through hell and back,  using amazing erratic (and sometimes dizzying)  camera work,  underscored by a brilliant,  repetitious phat bassline,  and as we endure the journey with the camera,  everything slowly calms down (camera,  music score changes,  characters).  I have never seen anything like it and it is by far the most original way I've seen a movie shot before,  and thats the foundation of a harrowingly real experience of degradation and basic human emotion.",1092614400,5,1067,4.982857142857143
1875253,4,B00008YNI2,"Gaspar Noe's Irreversible is filmed in the same style as Christopher Nolan's excellent Memento. With the story unfolding in reverse sequence, the audience's first impression of the story doesn't end up being the same once it finishes.

Everyone has made it a point to mention the disturbing and hard-to-watch sodomizing that Monica Bellucci's character goes through at the hands of a random, strung-out stranger. This 10-minute sequence is as disturbing as any film sequence I have ever had the chance to watch. There is absolutely no feeling of lust or sexiness this scene brings up. A sense of shock, disgust and pain is more appropriate reaction to seeing the lovely Ms. Bellucci's character go through a very inhumane experience. This scene goes a long way to explaining the film's beginning where a brutal and equally inhumane murder takes place inside a murky, red-lit, underground gay S&M club.

As the film continues to move backwards in time and shows the viewer the earlier and happier time of Bellucci's and Vincent Cassel's characters, the earlier scenes of violence take on a more poignant and sad note. In a space of a day many lives are broken and destroyed, and in the end all because of a random night occurrence in an dingy, lit underpass.

Gaspar Noe's film is not for everyone and even those daring enough to take a chance to view it will have a hard time sitting through the first half of the film. The film itself takes on a dream-like quality as it begins to unfold. From its nightmarish tone and look to a dreamy last reel. I have heard people call Noe's film as exploitive and misogynistic in its treatment of its main female character. In the end, Noe's choice to shoot the rape scene so realistic and have it linger and linger shows the viewer that evil and ugly things do happen in real life. One either takes it and learn from it or turn away and pretend it never happened.

Irreversible is a film that people will either love or hate. This film doesn't straddle the center when it comes to viewers reaction to it. Gaspar Noe's film is not perfect, but overall it provokes the viewer to think on what they've seen and felt as the story unfolded.",1091491200,74,2174,4.668407310704961
1875254,5,B00008YNI2,"There are two sides to ""Irreversible"". The first one is violent and disturbing, the second one beautiful and romantic. Since all reviewers from this forum chose the first one, I shall write about the second part of the film, which is beyond greatness. There is a party scene and a subway one that would make any film buff more than happy. And then there is a beautiful and tender love scene between Bellucci and Cassel.
The film is told backwards, ergo, the audience knows the characters' destiny. It's so sad to see them having such a great time together -- laughing and dancing, not knowing how their lives will be forever altered. This is great cinema. Monica Bellucci's performance is incredible -- I can't think of any actress (especially one from Hollywood) who would have accepted to play such a difficult part. Vincent Cassel (he did the voice of Robin Hood in Shrek) and Albert Duponteil are equally good. The whole movie is shot in single-take scenes, most of the dialogue being improvised by these great actors. The film has been directed by Gaspar Noe (Seul Contre Tous) and he brings us his unique vision to the material. The sountrack and the special effects are excellent, too.
If you haven't yet seen ""Irreversible"" and you have reservations regarding the violent content -- here's a tip for you: watch the second half of the film (where the party scene begins) and then judge for yourself if you want to see what's left out of this complex tragedy. Everybody knows that good and bad co-exist together. ""Irreversible"" has such a fresh and realistic look to life that in less than a year will probably become a classic.",1089417600,5,1634,4.7368421052631575
1875255,1,B00008YNI2,"What a thrash of a movie! Can't see what's the rave all about.
Tries to disguise a poor movie by doing silly things like running it in back to front (it starts with the end of the movie and work itself to the start). In between, one gets tortured by foul language aplenty and worse still a cameraman who seems to have been told by the director to point his camera to anywhere other than where he's supposed to. As a result, certain part of the movie was simply a pain and agony to watch with picture of darkened ceiling, flashing lights and nothing more than that.
Then, there's that attempt at plot. What a pathetic attempt at that. If you manage to figure out the back-to-front sequencing, then it's about a young (good-looking one) lady attending a party and deciding to leave early. On the way home, she got raped (and I believe many thought this is ground-breaking since it takes up a few minutes of groaning and further foul language). Boyfriend left party and found her raped, got raging mad running around looking for the culprit, thought he found the guy in a gay club (here's where you gotta tolerate the camera work mentioned above), got into a fight and his mate with him killed the one he was fighting with. Police arrives, take them away. END OF SHOW!!! Now how's that for plot!
Almost had to shut it off after the first 15 minutes but thought why not tolerate it to see how bad it can be. And believe me, it can be and indeed is VERY bad!
So here it is. A very badly made movie trying to disguise itself as something more than that by violence, nudity and sex. Do you need it?
Oh yes, it's in French so be ready to get through the movie reading subtitles if the above doesn't alert you to what's in store.",1089072000,14,1720,4.328173374613003
1875256,4,B00008YNI2,"If there's one thing that can be stated with utmost certainty, it is that ""Irreversible,"" a French film by writer/director Gaspar Noe, is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach.  In fact, this tale of the brutal rape of a helpless young woman is one of the most harrowing films ever made and features two of the most graphic scenes ever committed to film: the rape itself and the killing of the man responsible for the rape.
Although I imagine that very few people will end up subjecting themselves to this film in the long run, those who do will witness an amazing piece of work in many ways.  Like the movie ""Betrayal"" from 1983, ""Irreversible"" tells its story in reverse chronological order.  It begins with a frenzied man racing through a gay sex club, madly searching for someone we know merely as Le Tenia.  Only as the story develops - as we are taken ever further back in time - do we begin to understand what is going on: that this young man, Marcus, is seeking vengeance on the rapist who has brutally attacked his pregnant girlfriend.  Noe keeps us in a state of confusion by filming the scene in such a way as to reflect the maniacal state of Marcus' revenge-obsessed mind.  The camera bounces around in epileptic confusion while the audience attempts to get its bearings.  Eventually, as the filmmakers backtrack to reveal the events that have led up to this moment, the camera calms down and we get to see the whole ugly story acted out in painfully graphic detail.  In fact, in the rape scene itself, Noe reverses his filmmaking style 180 degrees, deliberately leaving the camera stationary and focused on the event as it plays itself out.  He simply won't allow us to stop looking.
There are some, I imagine, who might object to this film on moral grounds, feeling that it is little more than a cynical exploitation picture with artistic pretensions.  Yet that condemnation would do a disservice to the makers of this film who, I believe, do not want us to revel in the sordidness of what we see, but rather to be appalled by the unspeakably brutal way in which human beings can treat their fellow human beings.  By having us sit and witness every moment of this brutality without the comforting filter of cutaway shots or easy dissolves, Noe forces us to face the ugly truths about ourselves as a species.  The reverse-order structure of the film heightens the tragic nature of the story for it allows us to see just how happy and hopeful these characters are in the time right before the rape shatters their lives.  The latter half of the film contains no physical violence, yet watching it unfold is an ineffably sad experience, for we, unlike the characters themselves, are privy to the Sword of Damocles so precariously poised over their unsuspecting heads, yet find ourselves helpless in being able to rescue them from the inevitable destruction it will cause.  Thus, the structure robs us of even the remotest option of hoping against hope that the tragedy can somehow be avoided - for we have seen it as an already completed action.  For while the film may be ""reversible,"" life itself is not.  In the case of this film, at least, form does, indeed, become content.
Vincent Cassel as Marcus, Monica Bellucci as his girlfriend, Alex, and Albert Dupontel as their mutual friend, Pierre, all deliver excellent, heartfelt performances.
I doubt that many people will have the intestinal fortitude to make it through large segments of this film, but those who do will surely never forget what they've seen.",1088380800,11,3531,4.698541329011345
1875257,5,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible is a film that displaces the viewer in such a significant way that to watch it is more akin to dreaming about a real-life experience. The film, through dialogue, actions, and character archetypes, suggests that only way to make sense of and live through the horrific and reversed melodramatic anti-revenge storyline is to view the film through a near existential psychological perspective.  Yipe.  In easier language, the film demands your own removal of pre-conditioned emotional responses to rape, murder, revenge, humor, sexual excitement, intimacy, sadness, rage, and especially blame.  The very beginning of the film features the man from the feature I STAND ALONE telling another man how he messed his own life up...that time destroys all things.  His companion ultimately nay-says this, indicating that any crimes or tragedies are just what they are, nothing more...a series of events.  Noe challenges the viewers to attempt to view Irreversible in that very detached state, not for or against what you see. (nutty camera moves...)  By doing so you will be able to live through the incredibly sad and horrific storyline.  By Noe telling the story in reverse, he rescues the film from melodrama, vengence, or ""true crime"" genre BS.  Together, almost in a 50/50 contract deal, Noe and the viewer can attain the meaning of this story about Alex, Marcus, Pierre, the Tenia, ramifications and origins of any and all the events you see in Irreversible.  The result will vary, I believe, from person to person...as it should.  I can only echo other reviews in warning you of the intensity and violence, but the sadness and (yes) beauty of the film's meaning that I derived was phenomenal.",1087689600,,1701,5.108303249097473

1875259,4,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible is a film that explores the deep pain that human life can have, through extreme violence and sexuality.
I have wanted to see this movie for quite a long time, but due to it's graphic nature, (and strong rating) I have not been able to watch it...until now. Incredible performances by all 3 leads, especially Monica Bellucci. This woman has such an amazing beauty that sometimes her look is overpowered by her performance, but in this film, both work for her.
You've already heard the story of this film by now, the movie (which is told backwards) is about a woman who got raped in an underpass in Paris. When her 2 closest male friends find out, they both search for the person who violated their best friend.
You've already got WARNING written all over this movie because of its graphic violence and strong sexuality. If you have seen Requiem for a Dream, this one is similar to that but just 100x more disturbing. Gaspar Noe's direction is great but completely all over the place, with an enormous amount of camera spins and dizzying movement, which is placed at the beginning of the film.
Kudos goes out to the Visual FX team for making the fire extinguisher scene truly disturbing and increbibly hard to watch. The featurette, on the DVD, of how they made that scene work is amazing, from using different layers, all the way to prosthetics. The sound editing of this film is great (especially in that scene) which makes the bashing sounds so hard and grusome that you have just got to turn your head away. The rape scene is also hard to watch as it seems to go on for an eternity. I can't get enough of Bellucci's performance in that scene, where she just gave everything that she had into making it seem belivable and sad all at the same time. (special mention also goes out to Jo Prestia)
Gaspar Noe is a director that is for sure a force to be reckoned with. I have not seen his other film 'I Stand Alone' (where the subject matter, from what I've heard, is the same) but for sure, I have got to check that one out. Noe dives into the deepest emotion that a person can have and presents them with brutal honesty. Even if you don't want to admit it, these things happen all the time, to the most unsuspecting people and I belive that Noe made this film because life is not always filled with rainbows and happy people; life is difficult, and for him to shed light on issues and events that most individuals would not even want to tackle, is brave and admirable.

When was the last time you saw a film which engrossed you so much, but at the same time you wanted to switch it off?
Right from the beginning, IRREVERSIBLE pulls you in and while the initial camera work is annoying, it helps create a mood of sheer eeeriness.  When the siren-like music begins, you know it's not going to be a pleasant ride.
The film makes you question human behaviour, and the total disrepect that humans can have towards other humans. The film is shown backwards and it really works in this format.  You know what is going to happen to the characters, before they do.  This of course will make you cry because the main characters do not deserve what happens to them.
SUMMARY:
IRREVERSIBLE is a very sad film which shows the disgusting side of human behaviour, while in so many ways it is a beautiful film.  The two awful scenes are what everyone is talking about.  However, if you can get through these scenes, you will be rewarded ... simply because beyond those scenes, the film has much more to tell.",1086480000,5,1196,4.530232558139535
1875262,5,B00008YNI2,"After witnessing the nightmare of Gaspar Noe's ""I Stand Alone,"" a movie that left me in open-mouthed awe for days afterwards, I just knew I had to see ""Irreversible."" I am not a big foreign film aficionado, not by a long shot, but Noe's films are worth watching simply because they are deeply disturbing jaunts into the darkest recesses of the human psyche. He's not above showing life as it really is, and he does it in ways that make you laugh at the cleverness of the presentation even as you cringe in disgust at the subject matter. In other words, his pictures are right up my alley. I always love to watch cinema that challenges the viewer on some level, something rare indeed in an age of the American special effects laden summer blockbusters. That doesn't necessarily mean I always like these types of films; oftentimes I don't when the fine line between challenging and pretentiousness is crossed, but Noe's stuff is great because it is premium grade weirdness. ""Irreversible"" will remind many viewers of the American film ""Memento,"" except Noe's film is darker, oh so much darker, than that movie.
""Irreversible"" flows backwards, with the closing credits opening the film and each scene shown from the end towards the beginning. Right from the start, you know you're going to see something different. Boy, are you ever! A sex club with fleeting sounds and images of pornographic behaviors, a sickening scene of a human head being bashed in with a fire extinguisher, and an arrest quickly start you wondering about what it all means. As the film progresses (regresses?), we learn why one man killed another in that seedy bar. Alex (Monica Bellucci), a rather carefree soul, was brutally raped and beaten by a thuggish French pimp in a subway tunnel. Her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent Cassel) promptly had an emotional meltdown when he discovered what happened to his lovely woman. Full of seething rage, he goes on a rampage through the city looking for the man who maimed Alex. Along for the ride is Pierre (Albert Dupontel), Alex's former boyfriend who desperately attempts to rein in Marcus's reckless quest for vengeance.
Surprises abound in ""Irreversible,"" surprises that will leave you thinking about the film long after it ends. I was a little amazed I figured out how the film concludes (begins, actually) long before I got there. You just knew there had to be some big, explosive revelation that would give Alex's victimization even more pathos. Well, there is and it's quite shocking. In fact, it would have worked almost as well had the film been shown in chronological order. Since Noe chose to reverse the sequence of the scenes, he not only retains the film's shock value but also imbues it with a frequently recurring sense of ""what if."" If only Marcus had paid more attention to his wife at that party. If only Alex had listened to Pierre and not gone out alone in a dangerous neighborhood. If only, if only, if only. You get the idea. This sense of identification gives the movie its edge. We've all done the same thing, asked the same questions, after a personal tragedy. I know I have.
What shocks even more are the things Gaspar Noe can get away with showing in a French film. The French have little problem with overt pornography, morally repugnant violence, and lengthy discussions on the most intimate details of sexual relationships. Sure, American films are violent and sometimes crass in their discussions of sex, but not like the French films I have seen lately. I can't imagine any mainstream film made here that would show a rape sequence that runs for nearly ten minutes, or the weird goings on in a club. If you have a serious problem with any of these issues, stay far, FAR away from ""Irreversible."" For that matter, stay just as far away from Noe's ""I Stand Alone,"" a movie that shows in gruesome detail a murder/suicide. I will say that the filmmaker does not in anyway attempt to glorify the vicious acts of cruelty and barbarism he depicts in his movies. That doesn't mean it makes these incidents any easier to watch, however.
""Irreversible"" is a shocker on many levels, a film not suited to a majority of the movie going public. It's not the sort of movie you would take a date to, or watch with members of your family unless you're a member of the Manson family. It should go without saying that Noe's picture is not suitable for young children. I recommend watching ""Irreversible"" alone so that it becomes a personal experience. I don't know what Gaspar Noe will come out with next, or if he'll ever make another film again, but I want to see it whatever it ends up being. If you haven't seen ""I Stand Alone"" before watching this one, make sure you see it soon. Fans of this type of cinema should also check out ""Baise-Moi,"" another French film filled with even greater amounts of nihilism and despair than this one.",1085011200,369,4862,4.72791519434629

The camera work in the early stages is simply irritating and pretentious.  The continual girations of the camera creating visual frustration rather than conveying a mood, which is presumably the intention.  By telling the story in reverse you know all you are interested in knowing about the characters (who I found uninteresting) and the plot 2/3 of the way through the film thus making the final 1/3 tedious.

1875286,5,B00008YNI2,"I don't know where to begin.  I never deal with a sysnopsis when I review on here because I feel there are already plenty of them.  The story is extremely simple - a rape/revenge story told in reverse.  This film is often compared to Momento due to this reverse storytelling.  However, whereas Momento is a puzzle movie, and the device seems more gimmick then anything else, Irreversible uses the technique to convey its message more powerfully.  That message is, quite simply, one of inevitability and if you are not moved by the end of the film, then you must just be in shock.
The violence is intense, but hardly excessive.  The beginning of the film is frenetic but, as it progresses/regresses, it becomes more and more serene.  Every aspect of the film - editing, cinematography, the pacing of the dialouge, setting - support this form.  The effect is powerful, intellectually and emotionally.  This film is not about shock and it will be remembered as a milestone in later years.",1082419200,,985,4.781065088757397
1875287,1,B00008YNI2,"First of all, the cameraman needs to learn to hold the camera steady in his hands. Be prepared for 95 minuts of shaky, unstable, jerky camera movements on your screen. After the first five minutes I got seasick. Also the movie is shot in dark colors, and usually you have hard times seeing the details, and only observe moving silhouettes (in addition to the graininess and annoying jerky camera movements). The first murder scene in the basement of a sleazy gay club is not worth watching at all, as it tells nothing, signifies nothing, and from the cinematographic viewpoint made especially badly and unconvincing. The rape scene is also very unnatural and laughable, making me think that the movie had no director whatsoever. All in all the movie is a big waste of time - the storyline is one-dimensional and boring, the acting is poor, the directing is virtually non-existent, and the camerawork is the worst in years. I don't know why all those critics were raving about the flick, but even the mediocre Kill Bill would be much better worth of your time and money.",1082332800,4,1069,4.752688172043011
1875288,3,B00008YNI2,"A movie is a vehicle by which it detaches the viewer from their real life and absorbs them into the fantasy life of the film. Fantasy and Detachement are the number one reasons why movies make so much money. Holloywood banks on those two things, sO much so that I believe that very few films are allowed to remind us of our realities. Disturbing and brutal films such as Irreversible do the opposite.  They suck you in only to slap you in the face with realty. Movie-goers are not used to this. I wasn't used to it either, but that's why I liked it. I realized that in my own mind I had glossed over violence and rape. Thinking it's always the nice and clean situations of ""Law and Order"" or CSI. This is not always true and this movie proves it. Did it have to be so brutal in it's depiction of those crimes? That's debatable. What's not debatable is it's affect. You are  in no way Detached from anything while watching this movie",1082332800,3,932,4.32
1875289,4,B00008YNI2,"First,hats off to the director for using various camera tricks and techniques in engaging the viewer. It took me a few minutes to realize why the camera lens was in a severe state of vertigo the first 15 minutes into the film. Thank goodness however the entire movie was not filmed using this technique ! Probably would have passed out. The reason for the swirling and sickening motion of the lens and the droning of the high tech synth sound of the soundtrack in the beginning is to capture  the madness of the moment of how one man and his friend are seeking vengeance for a heinous crime (rape) committed against his girlfriend. It also transports you into his head.
The entire story is told in a backwards sort of chronological order leading to previous possible events and circumstances that led to Monica Belucci's character becoming a rape victim. The rape scene is one of the most graphic I have seen in any film in my entire life ! You will begin to actually wonder if the scene indeed was real or not. The rape scene alone is one that can haunt the viewer for time to come. Other violent acts are just as equally shocking and extremely believable due to excellent makeup, special effects, and possible cg effects. There is frontal nudity of both male and female actors that may offend some viewers (this is definitely not for children, either)!
The biggest mind trick played on the audience is how the movie progresses in real viewing time, yet, you must keep in mind that the story is unfolding backwards. Hence leading to the beginning and not the end. As we follow Belluci's character and the others one soon almost forgets the first 15 shocking minutes of the film, including the underpass rape scene, and start to think that there is a happy ending. There is NO happy ending (nor beginning for that matter)...I went out on a limb to see this one, particularly since Roeper and Ebert raved about it. Well, in all honesty, it is a very brutal movie to sit through the first time and it is definitely not one I will be seeing again. Due to the filming and stroytelling techniques and all too realistic effects it does merit some attention but only by viewers who can stomach it !...",1081641600,,2194,4.568527918781726
1875290,3,B00008YNI2,"The controversy attached to 'Irreversible' no doubt stemmed from such audacity of the director to include such reastically graphic portrayals of violence and rape.  Portrayal of the former involved a scene in which a man's head was crushed repeatedly and brutally with a fire extinguisher in the name of revenge. However, it is the 10 minute rape scene, in which all the nuances of humiliation, degradation and sheer animalism of rape is open for full-view exhibition, that caused the public outcry for the film's ban (unsuccessfully in Australia).
  What was the point of such gratuity?  Many say it was unnecessary to go to such extremes to prove a point.  But it is important to realise that in the real world, these occurrences are commonplace.  The film is a study of the dark side human nature. Ultimately it argues that violence is blind, destroying everything in its path, leaving a trail of irreparable damage in its wake. The violence stems from man's evil; the rapist simply wanted to use Belucci's character (Alex) for his own pleasure. This violence then begets more violence, as Alex's partner Marcus rampages through the night-life to find the perpetrator.  Yet in the end, the man that suffered his vengeance and rage was not the rapist.  And so the chain reaction initiated by one man's self-indulgence and morally reprehensible decision to rape led to the spiralling destruction of many other lives.
  The title refers to the structure of the film, as viewers watch the cascade of events in reverse from the opening where Marcus and Pierre storm through a gay BDSM club, leading to the bashing of a man with the fire extinguisher, to the rape then to more happier times before these tragedies. The image of the beautiful untouched Belucci laying peacefully on luscious green grass helps to draw the movie to a conclusion. This reverse chronology detaches us as viewers from any empathy we may have for the Marcus and Pierre, inhibiting us from labelling their acts of retaliation as heroic and justified, such that we are able to witness the extent of their reprehensible behaviour, regardless of the motivation. But it also helps to soften the heavy blow delivered by such a dark and pessimistic (""Time destroys all things"") film by concluding with a picturesque, almost niave and innocent view of the world.
  While the film does raises genuine thought-provoking issues, it loses points for times of blatant pretention namely, amongst other inane attempts for the avant-garde, the swirling camera angle lasting for the first 20 or so minutes of the film acheiving nothing except to make the audience nauseous. And the attempts to explain the events as some act of fate via visions in dreams destabilises the foundation for the film's arguments as it suddenly and paradoxically argues that the horrors of life do not arise from bad decisions of some but, ludicrously, from some cosmically regulated force. Moreover, the inclusion of the gay club was an attempt to increase shock value. To discriminate against gay people by placing them in a negative context indicates the homophobic contention of the writers/director and only serves to magnify the myopia in the movie's vision.
  A movie not for the faint-hearted to the weak-in-stomach.  This piece is an insightful human study but alas, succumbed to the desire to appeal the the pretentious art-house crowd.",1081555200,2,3380,5.032258064516129
1875291,4,B00008YNI2,"But, all in all this film is the most realistic film I have ever seen. It is not for the mainstream viewer, of course. This film was shown at one of my student film organizational meetings, and even most of the film students walked out of the room. Mostly men because I was the only woman that dared to see it, which I think is a shame. Many people cannot take sexual violence or violence in general but, it is a reality. This happens to ordinary people everyday. People are killed in equally or unfortunately  ( I would hate to imagine) more horrible ways than this. The thing about film is that people naturally disconnect themselves from film because from the beginning, they believe it is a ficticious water-down version of life.  But, Irreversible doesn't do that for you. It takes to deep into the dark, grotesque and evil sides of life. And they don't sugar coat it. That is what made me love this film. I probably can only see it once or twice in my lifetime. That's enough. But, I think everyone should see it. Every man and woman. I think it would do wonders in deterring sexual violence because of how intense it is. Anyone who says that this film should have never been made or says that it is too much. All I can say is that they must live in a paradise, completely shut out from the world. Because this film is real.  They used a real couple to portray the characters because it could only be believable in that aspect. For a real couple's lives to be ripped apart by such a gruesome act is real.  My whole reason for coming into film was to portray real stories that are not being told on the big screen. This film inspired me. And that is what it is for to inspire and to inform. Not to entertain. So if you are looking for entertainment, go to Disney.",1081555200,,1768,4.316265060240964

Every second, every one of them is practically bursting with comically exaggerated emotions (unintentionally comic, that is), foaming at the mouth, convulsed by kaleidoscopic and manic flashes of existential angst/despair/desire/frustration/rage/etc.  It's like watching a bunch of moths on PCP bouncing off the insides of a Mason jar.  Ah, the passion, the passion...
(So THIS is what the Buddhists call ""the comedy of the ego."")
The film is kind of like a film version of Martin Amis' book, ""Time's Arrow"" which tells a story backwards.

The movie is well laid out and at the end you almost have contradictory feelings because you see the couple when everything is ok, but at the same time you know what is going to happen later that night.  The reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because of the camera work at the very beginning of the movie.  I think that the varying angles were used to help illustrate the insanity of the situation, but to me it seemed a little over done.  I also was confused by the very end of the movie and have heard people say that it could be a dream, but I am not sure I saw it that way.
Either way very moving, very disturbing movie.

1875306,4,B00008YNI2,"I can't deny that Irreversible is an interesting,intriguing film. It is definately original, and well put together. It also happens to include a scene of brutal violence,involving a man's head beaten down to the bones with a fire extinguisher, and an absolutely heart wrenching rape scene that lasts for something of 10 minutes, involving the gorgeous Monica Bellucci.
I feel that the ULTRA violence is crucial to the way the film works, because, since the movie runs in reverse sequence,a la Memento, you start out with the bloody violent end, and ""end"" with the clean,pure,and happy beginning. That is one of the top reasons I praise this film; its ability to take you from a place so dark and sinister you couldn't even imagine, into a peacful world without blinking once, and losing its intensity. Also,I want to add that I can understand how some would be turned off by the heavy content of the rape scene, but don't go calling it gratituous,or revolting. Rape is a SERIOUS,SERIOUS  crime, and I'm sick of it being glossed over in the movies. If you find it revolting,then don't pick a movie that deals with the subject. Seriously, people, it's time that rape was handled honestly in a film. Safe to say, this film achieves that to the max.
Director Gaspar Noe masterfully creates a dark,creepy,sinister atmosphere through the use of lighting,soundtrack and nauseating camera shifts. The actors also seem very natural in their roles-it really doesn't feel like they're acting at all, which is the case with many European films of quality. Monica Bellucci is lovely and full of inexplicable,irresistible charm. Towards the end of the film, where you get to know these people prior to the horrific events that took place, you see a vivid portrait of a young couple. Vincent Cassel, who is Bellucci's real life husband, worked well alongside Monica as her boyfriend in the film. The film created a compelling,tender portrait of their relationship, making it all the more heart wrenching to think of the way things turned out. The film's reverse order workes perfectly, and I believe the film would not have achieved it's effect without this technique.
All in all, I'll say that the latter,toned down parts towards the film's end do not pale at all in comparison to the film's brutal beginning. They're just different, putting it mildly. Another interesting prospect the film brings up through a series of hints, and silent gestures, is that perhaps all this horror was just imagined inside the female protagonist's head. Pretty to think so, ain't it?
Irreversible is not for the squeamish, but if you're up for an interesting,altogether different film, see it once. I'm not going to call it a work of art, or claim it as life-changing.

1875307,5,B00008YNI2,i think that this is a great film.  It is in the same way using imagery to give you a certain feeling of the points of the fillm.  I really don't like that people don't like it because they would like a movie like blue velvet or a clockwork orange for beautiful imagery but this is showing it to have more of a feeling of the emotions and the tone of the film.  Its a bit hypocritical.  I do understand however that a person wouldnt like it because the context and content were too harsh.  I felt a bit ill after a scene in it myself.  The acting was really good.  There was good chemistry between alex and marcus.

1875308,5,B00008YNI2,"Unquestionably the biggest breath of fresh air for me in the year 2003 was Noe's second unnerving, inspiring and overall pessimistic film.  Here, I would argue, he has painted a masterpiece.

The movie counts backwards from one tragedy and to another as we see what caused the first inexplicable and horrific sequence to occur and then each and every scene before that.  It is intense, entertaining, shocking and edgy as hell.  Films like this push the bar far enough and are done with just enough mainstream appeal and pure talent that they gain some steam and attention and permanantly transform how we view, enjoy and create cinema.  This film is about as ugly as you can get but doesn't seem to wallow in any of it's content to the point where it could be deemed gratuitous...no matter how long it really lingers.  It's easy for some to turn away and say this is junk for showing you things you do not want to see (e.g. realistic rape and murder) but it is still important to allow total freedom of expression; and Noe's work, whether intentionally or not makes him an advocate for such expression.  He is also technically as strong as anyone in Hollywood.

The infamous rape sequence that led to many viewers walking out of the theater seems to have an amazing effect on the audience.  I have a mini-cinema in my house and I show this movie to people as often as I can.  The same things happens.  Just as the rape scene reaches a point that makes us uncomfortable enough to consider getting angry with the movie and leave the room, it ends.  I'm inclined to say that this is intentional.  Rape should never be expressed in a film in any other way.  It should make us uncomfortable and scared.  Unfortunately, most of us are so desensitized to violence and it's consequences, that it takes a sequence like this to get under our skin.  Make no mistake about it, if a movie that handles subject matter like this gets under your skin then it has done it's job better than most.

You'll get your money's worth here despite it's grainy and cheap feel.  The film is done that way to make the scenes more raw and believable obviously.  The beginning murder sequence is handled so delicately (as evident by the special effects overview on the DVD) that it makes me shiver as to why a filmmaker would got to this extent to show us something this horrible.  Well it all makes sense in perspective, trust me.  Gaspar Noe is a true artist and Irreversible is a great film that I will recommend to anyone willing to handle it's content.",1077840000,10,2527,4.54646017699115
1875309,2,B00008YNI2,"THere are few films that actually make me sick to my stomach, and this is one of them.  The violence is so graphic - there is one scene where you can count how many teeth a man loses as his head is slowly bashed in - that I simply had to fast forward it OFTEN.  Really, it made me heave, near vomiting.  Then, there is the horror at the center of the plot, the fate of a beautiful and happy young woman.

Now there was a time in my youth when I would have relished my ""reaction,"" feeling that such a film made me ""experience"" a new reality, etc.  All the artistic longings - often nonsense in retrospect - of the inexperienced.  Well, I am afraid that life has made me no longer want to see such things.  I have had friends who suffered similar things and there is nothing to learn from it and no value is bringing it to the screen in my opinion.  However, it does make the film controversial - look at the range of reviews here!

Because of the odd way that the film is edited, I am not revealing the plot here.  Indeed, with the camera waving around in an attempt at avant garde technique, it added to my nausea.  Nonetheless, the acting is very very good.  Moreover, there are philosophical points throughout the whole thing and they are not totally pretentious, but add to the portrayal of life and love in the film.  The chemistry between the actors is totally believable, as is the changes in personality.

Am I a bourgeois philistine for saying that it was simply awful to watch?  Perhaps, but maybe I have just outgrown this kind of art thing.  I think you can get deep philosophy and thoughtfulness without such total horror.

1875310,4,B00008YNI2,"IRREVERSIBLE for such title of an unconventional thriller literally means one is impossible to undo but to regret for what happened.

Artistically or notoriously, that's up to anyone to say.
Outstanding, incredible performance though by the curvaceous Italian screen goddess Monica Bellucci (MALENA, BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF), and a multi foreign festival awards winning film by the fiercely intelligent French director Gaspar Noe (I have no problem with that). This film is seen mostly set upon nightime out-takes, from a rundown living hall with glimmering light across or the glittering posh interior of a eatery lounge, the downtown neon streets, inside the pedestrian underground tunnel or the subway train, to that somewhat bizarre hole on earth i.e. a sleazy S&M club. All these afterdark urban substances add a strong atmosphere to the film's brooding background that will leave you highly strung right from the start.

1875311,4,B00008YNI2,"perhaps one of the most shocking films i've seen in the past year or so, i'm having a difficult time placing a star rating on this review but let me give you some facts if nothing else. for starters, monica belluci is one of the most beautiful in the actress in the business & i hated watching her gruesome rape scene(even though this isn't the most graphic scene in the film) this montage alone was perhaps the most scary rape scene since baise moi or i spit on your grave. having said this, i can respect the artistry of the film & the terrific performances but i couldn't bring myself to watch it more than once. gaspar noe has a style here similiar to nolan's memento(although a little less confusing i believe) which is cool but certain scenes here tend to drag including the senseless acts of hatred & violence. irreversible opens up with a naked old man sitting on a bed telling us how time manages to literally destroy everything & we should already be forewarned that nothing good could possibly happen throughout the course of 90 odd minutes. he then tells a younger gentleman how his young daughter was taken away from him after he sexually molested her. yuck! in the next scene, we see two young men searching all over an s&m gay club to find some man & we have no understanding as to the urgency of finding this mysterious character. needless to say, you learn more information about each character or event with each montage. in essence, each montage shows us more detail as to what has transpired & what will lead up to the violent chain of events which are shown in the second scene. i should make a point that watching a man's arm broken by another man & then seeing a man's face literally crushed is a bit excessive for an artsy film so this may disturb many viewers. as i stated earlier, the rape scene isn't the only harrowing or intense scene in irreversible. there isn't really a whole lot i can gather from this film except that the terrible things we do to one another often are permanent & humans by nature are barbaric in ways we can't possibly imagine. definately not a feel good film by any means & most viewers will perhaps be subject to much nausea after watching but i still tend to believe irreversible will have a grand cult following for some strange reason. i give it 4 stars out of a possible 5 for great acting, nausea inducing camera-work, & a decent film-making style. the dialogue is an honorable mention but most people will probably only view this film for one obvious reason. they will want to see if this film is as shocking & truly repulsive as so many have stated before me. if you loved memento or baise moi, probability suggests you will probably want to see this one too. it's hard to believe though that you can actually purchase this in a store like best buy. wait a second, best buy also sold a faces of death box set so i'm not too surprised after all.",1076371200,5,2905,4.441947565543071
1875312,2,B00008YNI2,"At first let me say that even if u are a gorehound and think that u have seen the ""nasties out there"", this film will still hit u like a hammer. In fact it will take some time to get over the face crushing scene, which is indeed irreversibly traumatic for the viewer. The official homepage of Irreversible offers a clip about the making of the gore effect which can help to take some impact out of that shocking moment. Yet it still hit u hard as it goes deep into the subconsciousness of human fear, fear of mutilation and disfigurement. Also the rape scene should be mandatory viewing for men who play down domestic violence against women. It hurts to realize that there are men who do such incredibly cruel things to women.
Yet Gaspar Noe has produced another movie that goes with a new trend in Euro cinema that I consider questionable. He does have a point though, the fact that the whole story is told backwards leaves u with a bad feling as u know that the beautiful Monica Bellucci we see at the end of the film will end up molested and brutally battered. Life is hell and men are beasts. Bottom line of the film. It shows the effect of vigilancy and how the vicious circle of violence drags everyone deeper and deeper into destruction. Yet the ""New Euro Cinema"" still does not offer what it lacked for so many years, GOOD STORIES. Hollywood on the one hand has fallen into the trash can of commercialized nonsense and loveless self promotion. Yet the Euro front, especially French cinema obviously feels that the apathy of modern movie goers needs to be filled with ever growing shocks and breaking of taboos. However if u are looking for a film that will haunt u in your dreams, watch this one, but do not expect too much just because it has the label ""Non-Hollywood"" on it.",1076284800,5,1784,4.458715596330276

It's a goodish film mostly because its ending is too abrupt and doesn't completely deliver on the tagline: ""Time destroys everything.""  See it, by all means, if you can deal with the emotional debilitation that will follow.

The character development and dialogue are first-rate and extremely realistic. You come to know these people and identify with them. Had the movie not been done in reverse order, you may have actually cared for them.
You have never seen violence this realistic on screen before (not since Bunuel and Dali's ""The Andalusian Dog"" at least). Horrific and beautifully done. The main complaint of critics seems to be that the violence is gratuitous. That may be, but it brings about a feeling of revulsion in the normal person, which I think is the point. Additionally, the movie does not glorify violence at all. There is nothing erotic or sexually exciting about the rape scene. And the violence at the night club has real consequences.
I laugh at you people who are offended by this yet see no problem in the glorification and sanitization of violence by mainstream Hollywood.",1075680000,3,1022,4.879310344827586
1875335,5,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible is French director Gaspar No's second feature film, after the mildly successful ""I stand alone"", released in 1998.  Irreversible premiered last year at the Cannes film festival and quickly gained a cult reputation as a film that had packs of people exiting the theatre in the middle of the presentation in a state of shock.  As a person well versed in shock cinema I have sadly become desensitized to a lot of on-screen violence but once in a while a film will come along that will shock me.  Irreversible did more than just shock me, it sickened me.  There were a couple of scenes in this film that had me choking back bile, looking away from my T.V. set and thankful that I was watching it alone and hadn't subjected anyone else into viewing this orgy of violence with me.
The entire film rolls in reverse order, starting with the ending credits.  The next 20 minutes show us an uptight guy named Marcus and his friend Pierre enter a gay brothel in search of ""Le Tnia"", a pimp who raped Marcus' girlfriend Alex.  As the movie unfolds in reverse order, we see the events that lead up to Alex's rape and the tight friendship that the three have.
The first half hour of the film is a very taxing experience on the viewer.  The camera constantly spins, turns and twists in every imaginable direction.  Anyone prone to seasickness or headaches might find this to be very unpleasant.  Not to mention the pounding score that never lets up and pretty much muffles any dialogue on screen.  Fluent in French, I fully intended to watch the film in its original version, however the constant noise of the industrial-tinged score and booming nightclub music makes it nearly impossible to make out what the characters are saying and I had to resort to switching on the English subtitles.  After the first 30 minutes (which are the climax of the events since the film plays backwards) things slow down a bit and the shifting camera and loud noise finally let up, until of course No subjects the viewer to an absolutely horrific 9-minute rape sequence.  It is easily the most shocking scene of its type that I've ever seen and it's the way it's presented to us that makes it all the more shocking.  The camera never shifts, there's no ominous music, just the horrible cries of anguish of the helpless victim.  This rape sequence and a gruesome death scene involving someone getting bashed in the head with a fire extinguisher 20+ times are really the only major shockers of the movie but they are such intense scenes that it is no wonder so many people at Cannes walked out on the movie.
Once the movie ended, I couldn't help but restart the movie right away and watch the first half hour again.  The first time I saw these climactic scenes I felt somewhat indifferent as I didn't even know the characters yet.  But I knew I'd see it in a very different light the second time around.  Not since Memento had a film made me want to re-watch a major portion of the film immediately after the initial viewing.  As I flicked off my T.V. set I felt disturbed but also at the same time felt like I had witnessed a truly creative piece of filmmaking by an upcoming maverick filmmaker that would have a lasting effect on me.  Irreversible plays like an urban and intellectual art house version of ""I spit on your grave"", an all-out assault on the senses that pummeled me into submission during its mercifully short 90 minutes.  It is shocking, sickening and at times thoroughly unpleasant. It is also one of the best films I've seen in quite some time.",1075420800,3,3542,4.574367088607595
1875336,2,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible was recommended to me by a friend and I did not read any of the reviews on Amazon.com.  This was a serious mistake.  I was unpleasantly surprised by the quality of this film by director Gaspar Noe.  One viewing is not enough to understand the intentions of the director and the meaning, if there is any, of the movie.  Before watching this film viewers should know:
1. The action begins at the end in violence and chaos and moves to the beginning, a montage of the starry heavens.
2. Chaos is the existential theme of this film.  Any meaning to life must be individually determined by each person.  God is dead and everthing is permitted.  The conclusion we must reach is that the director believes the world is a violent and malevolent place and even if we are careful to avoid disaster, this is not always possible.  Adults know this and don't need to be assualted by senseless violence and despicable behavior to be convinced that we can't be too careful.  Suffering is universal and can't be avoided.  In Irreversible, suffering is chaotic and meaningless.  Revenge adds to suffering.
3. For those who want to decide for themselves what to think of the backward progression of the plot in Irreversible, the following is a summary of events from beginning to end -- reverse this list and you will start at the beginning of the film.
A. We see a montage of a spiraling universe which disolves into a scene of Alex, a beautiful young woman reading on the grass in an idyllic scene with children playing around her.
B. We cut to her apartment and her boyfriend Marcus.  They are in bed and he tells her he wants to have anal sex with her.  This admission will be important as the story progresses.
C. We move to a party where we are introduced to her former boyfriend Pierre, a philosopher, if we can believe it.  He appears to be a somewhat shy person who is genuinely interested in Alex, in contrast to Marcus, an immature, self-centered, childish person who gets high on drugs and drink.
D. Alex leaves the party and tries to cross a busy street in Paris, I think.  She decides instead to take an underground passage to cross the street and meets there a pimp called La Tenia.  This man brutally rapes Alex anally, a recurring theme in the film.  The rape is the longest ""set piece"" in the film and is gratuitous in its extended violence.  Alex is beaten almost to death by La Tenia after the rape.  Along with Marcus and Pierre, we watch Alex being taken to the hospital by an ambulance.
E. Marcus is determined to have revenge against the person who assaulted Alex and goes on a search, with his friend Pierre, to find this person.
F. Marcus determines that La Tenia assaulted Alex and he goes to a gay establishment called ""The Rectum"" to find him.  In The Rectum anal sex is the norm, of course. The Rectum appears to be a recreation of Dante's Inferno.
G. La Tenia is talking with another person in The Rectum and this unidentified man is first assaulted by Marcus, who believes the man is La Tenia.  This person deliberately breaks Marcus's arm before the unknown man is assaulted by Pierre.  Pierre takes a large fire extinguisher and smashes the head and face of the unknown person beyond recognition, killing him in the process.  This scene is among the most violent any person is likely to see at the movies.
H. The police come and take Marcus away to the hospital and arrest Pierre for murder.  Pierre is told by people in the crowd that he will be anally assaulted in prison.
The movie begins with the arrest of Pierre and works its way backward to the idyllic scene of Alex reading on the grass and then the apparent chaos of the starry heavens.
4. For the most part the director has shot this film with hand held cameras giving the audience a feel for the chaos of life.  The rape scene is one exception.  A stationary camera is used to allow us to focus on the violence we witness.
5. The background music is also unpleasant and chaotic, supposedly mirroring what we are witnessing.
6. Only the largest of TV screens will allow the viewer to experience what the director has in mind for us.  This film is meant to be seen in a theater where our senses will be truly assaulted.
7. This film is unrated, but the rating should be For Adults Only.  Most adults are going to rate this film objectionable in the extreme.
Summary:  If I had read this review, I would not have watched the film.  Life is unpleasant enough without adding unnecessary grief when we expect entertainment.  Irreversible is NOT entertainment.  It is a close up and personal look at hell on earth.  It is a punishing, not a pleasurable experience.",1074988800,25,4647,4.53357314148681
1875337,4,B00008YNI2,"In Irreversible, the director Gaspar No is pushing the audience into a dark sphere where the audience is exposed to some truly brutal violence as if No wants to educate the ignorant minds of the masses.  Thus, No is creating a very offensive experience as the story is told in reverse where the audience already knows of the coming events as the story unfolds.  The story itself will not be revealed here, however, the violence is extremely grotesque and might cause distress and disgust among the audience members.  However, behind the nastiness there is something to be pondered that might leave the audience with an echo ringing ""You cannot escape your actions.""  The cinematography is cleverly tied together with each frame, and it leaves the audience with a disturbing and distressing cinematic experience that might affect their sleeping patterns.",1074556800,,853,5.115107913669065
1875338,2,B00008YNI2,"<This review contains spoilers.>
There is no doubt that Irreversible is pretty well directed, that it is well acted, that many of its scenes are superbly realistic. The special effects, especially during the fire extinguisher scene, are nothing short of remarkable. But as far as I understand it, film is a storytelling medium, and for me this movie fails as a story.
You can't really sympathize with Markus as he hunts down the rapist because you don't yet know what happened. You don't understand how he and Pierre came to be in this situation, and all you feel is revulsion as you watch one man beat another man's brains in.
Gradually you learn how the situation spiraled out of control, and you learn that Markus ignored his girlfriend at a party until she left by herself and was brutally raped. And then you see a little of their love for each other, but by then it's too late.
Had the story been told in forward time, it might have worked better. But because of the timeline, none of the characters appear sympathetic except Alex, and she ends up in the hospital, scarred for life. Okay, so sometimes horrible things happen to people. You wish you could go back and change them, but you can't. So what? Do any of the characters undergo change or discover something about life or themselves? I guess Pierre does, the gentle ex-boyfriend who stumbles upon his capacity to kill, but I don't buy it. He follows Markus around the entire movie, trying to calm him down, and then while trying to defend him, he suddenly finds the rage to hammer a man 22 times in the head with a fire extinguisher? 22 times? This fellow would probably drop the extinguisher and run after the first disfiguring blow. But you don't know that at the beginning of the movie (end of the story), so you go with it. You have no choice. And later, when you see him in the previous scenes, you realize the gruesome murder was ridiculously out of character. Which, to me, makes the violence gratuitous. It would be a great scene if the story justified it, but without proper motivation, it's becomes shocking for the sake of shocking.
And yes, there are parallels drawn between Markus and the Tenia. We're pretty much bludgeoned in the head with them (pun intended). Yes, it's a fine line between being a brute boyfriend and an immoral rapist, but it might be interesting to reveal details about that line instead of blurring it further.
I think there are elements of a good movie here. The brutal violence doesn't make it less watchable for me--it's the relatively simple (and awkwardly structured) story, the lack of emotional texture that do that. I just don't see the point. Maybe I'm missing something. But if it's not entertaining, or it doesn't illuminate a dark area of life and show humans struggling to make it better, or SOMETHING redeeming, why make the movie? There doesn't have to be a happy ending. It doesn't have to be generic crap marketed to the masses. But if you're going to spend two hours of your life watching a movie, shouldn't you come away better (or different or changed) for having watched it?",1074556800,2,3095,4.649635036496351
1875339,4,B00008YNI2,"I went to see this film with a certain amount of trepadition and prejudice, thinking I would hate it just because of all the hype that I'd heard beforehand. I'd seen BAISE-MOI a few years before and thought it was just junk, so i kind of expected the same here. I was quite surprised to find that I actually enjoyed the film. It starts off pretty intensely, with twirling cameras following two guys as they run through a gay bar trying to find someone.  What follows is one of the most vicious depictions of a beating I've ever come across in a film.  Initially it comes across as some sort of homophobic attack, but as the film unspools and gives us the backstory MEMENTO-style, you find out what lead to the attack. From then on, the intensity gets upped as you find out what lead to the attack.  You find out later that the two guys who killed the dude in the gay bar did so out of revenge.  There's a scene where Monica Bellucci gets raped for a solid ten minutes. It gets pretty hard to watch, but honestly, I expected worse and found the opening scene much more shocking.  I disagree, however, with the people who found the film to be an exercise in exploitation.  I found the back story to be quite open-ended and left a lot of room for interpretation.  What was really strange is that the movie had me feeling amped up at the beginning and soothed and calm by the end of it.  Quite the reverse of what I expected. It left a lot of questions hanging too: was it just Bellucci's dream? Were the two guys justified for killing the man in the gay bar? Is revenge as senseless as the criminal act that motivates it? etc.  Having been the victim of a car-jacking once, I do understand the motivation for revenge. One of the hardest questions in life is how do you get revenge without being sucked into the world of the criminals who push you into it, and ultimately, becoming one of them?  What I also liked is that none of the characters is 'pure'. Marcus is obviously a womanizer and a bit of a loose'cannon, while Bellucci does have an air of the seductress/tease about her. Pierre is a wimp and a coward, but even he is pushed into deviant behaviour. I'd have to see the film again to sort out what it means because it's somewhat emotionally draining and hardly leaves you room to think...which may be the point of the director after all. All in all, a much better film than I expected it to be and certainly well above the works of other 'shock-meister' directors like Larry Clark. It's worth a viewing but it's not for the squeamish.",1074297600,,2541,4.375796178343949
1875340,3,B00008YNI2,"I think that Growman's review is very helpful, and I would incorporate the majority of his comments as my own.  However, I am not sure whether the director's intent may have been ""cherish life, love each other more.""  Maybe so, but trying to figure out what the director intended is really a moot exercise and quite frankly irrlevant to the review of the film.  What this film did for me, I felt, was showing how different violence can be perceived: violence in its raw form without explanation, and violence with a seed of vengence.  By having the sequence of events played out in reverse, my initial reaction to the brutal death at the beginning of the film was ""oh my God, why?!""  Then, I watched the scene again after watching the whole film, and my reaction suddenly turned to ""Yes, he deserves it.""  I wasn't proud of my second reaction, yet I think it does speak the truth to human nature.  By the way, anyone noticed that the person who was killed at the club was not the right guy??  (the rapist had a tape over his nose, who incidentally was watching his friend getting beaten to death by Pierre).  I am not sure whether Alex was indeed the one who suffered the most, considering that Pierre goes to jail for life having murdered someone in third-party self defense but against the wrong person . . .",1073865600,2,1310,4.493670886075949
1875341,5,B00008YNI2,"This art-house film manages to dredge up some of most ghastly taboo elements in society and renders them in livid upsets onto the screen. In Cannes, during its world premiere, critics called this the most controversial movie ever to be screened at the festival. There are good reasons for this. Firstly, it was obvious after the closing credits that this film would probably bypass the banning treatment in most countries. Secondly, the performances came from credible actors and actresses who obviously took the film very seriously and worked hard to make their characters functional. This makes it all more the terrible that the world will see France's Hollywood counterparts do the equivalent of participating in an adventure into the decrepit bowels of human waste.
The theme of Irreversible is a rape revenge movie. It contains the most shocking murder scene ever committed to celluloid and the most heinous sexual one too. This will unfairly lop this drama alongside the likes of ""I Spit on your Grave"" or ""Last House on the Left"". ""Last House on the Left"" is not as bad as ""I Spit on your Grave"" but is equally controversial for its rape sequence. ""Last House"" is shocking, but is passable because it has the moral elements of ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"" to consider. ""I Spit on your Grave"" is exploitation that is designed to cater for the gore market and has no place in cinema. Most horror fans will also agree that ""I spit on your Grave"" is simply sick and should never be repeated again. Some may even consider it dangerous material. I certainly would agree with that last statement and I hoped that a film like that would never be made again. Then Gasper Noe came along in 2002 and appeared to have done just that. When the censors let this one pass and it achieved some acclaim from the critics it got my attention.
Irreversible is like neither of the two movies mention above. It is hard to compare Irreversible to anything other than that of very moving, shocking and brutal drama. The film is designed backwards, running from the end to the beginning. This helps the viewer to come down from the bad trip that first forty minutes bangs into them. The film is also edited in such a way that it moves uncut from one scene to the next. This is achieved by a very nauseating camera movement which goes up into the air and flips around in circles to join up with the next sequence. This stomach-churning effect will have you feeling ill within the first five minutes. As Noe takes us into the red lit nadir of a homosexual nightclub you are about to see things that you have never seen before... nor do you want too. When the freak murder scene involving a fire extinguisher comes out of the blue, you are witnessing what seems like a very real and violent homicide. The camera does not cut away as a person appears to have his face smashed in to the point where all that remains is the lower quivering jaw and his arms shaking around. The question then remains as to why this happened, who is the dead man and why did they kill him? As the film moves backwards, you hope that is all is going to be explained and in many ways it is.
The resolution or justification never really comes but you realize that what has happened, transpired because it simply did - without cause, without validation but not without meaning. Noe's world is as much of a fantasy as it is a reality. There is nothing here that is going to reconcile what you witnessed and the film is pretty bleak through and through. It has many morals about the intention and execution of vigilante retribution but also about the desperateness of a lovers' sheer blind rage. Many things happen in this film because the protagonists did not take a moment out to consider their actions or the consequences. In many ways this film speaks volumes about the quality of life and those who disrespect it. It describes a world where bad guys can win and good people become victims. Sounds familiar? That is because it is. There is no happy Hollywood ending here because we do not live in Hollywood. Noe smacks that home to us and maybe some us have a need to be told this. Certainly I came away from this movie with a changed mind in a lot of respects. I want to live my life for the better and certainly want to avoid becoming or ending up like most of the characters here. In many ways this is a good thing and the film genuinely makes you want to value life, friends and love a bit more. It is strange that the nature of this movie would have this kind of effect - but it does.
The moral here is that life is precious. You should think about yourself and others a bit more and try to do more good than harm. Sometimes our pride and greed can sideline these things. Certainly Noe is saying that we should remember who and what we are and try to make a world for the better. It is certainly a worldly endeavour to get people to understand this and Noe's last reel contains a final vestibule of assertion which drives this point home to the viewer. It is a wicked way to present this just cause, but then again sometimes it is needed. It is strange that this film would have this paradox but then again Noe is a great director and his understanding of how we work is second to none. This is cinema at its most powerful, dramatic and engaging. Do not avoid this because of its offensiveness. There is a good moral message here to be gained.",1073520000,7,5410,4.465656565656565

I must say that I have a strong stomach and can take watch some pretty violent things with out having to look away.

Violence portrayed as reality rather than entertainment, etc. etc.  Sure, I get it.  But the fact remains that the filmaker(s) refuse(s) to allow there to be any hope or faith in humanity.  The banality and beauty in the ending scene (the first chrologically) between the romantically linked characters illustrates NOTHING.  Apparently, we are all predestined... which is a trite and infuriating belief system as far as I'm concerned.  One does not need to BELIEVE in what a film SAYS in order to LIKE it, I realize... the message of this film is simply too childish for me.

I don't believe all films should be touchy feely feel good crap (though those films have there place), but this pushed the limit to an unimaginable point.

1875368,1,B00008YNI2,"I'm still not sure what to make of this movie.  It could, on many levels, be considered a masterpiece because the images are quite simply stuck in my head.  The movie will not leave you alone and will follow you everywhere you go after having seen it.  I guess, this is one measure of a true masterpiece: something so moving you cannot and do not simply forget it after the credits roll.  On the other hand, you could look at this movie as a gargantuan piece of [expletive deleted] that much like the Howard Stern show is shocking for the sake of being shocking.  I had heard nothing about this movie and simply saw the ""Two Thumbs Up"" quote on the cover. So, how I sat through the first forty five minutes of this thing is an incredible act of intestinal fortitude on my part.  I will give you a little bit of the plot because it will in no way prepare you for this movie: this is basically a rape / revenge movie told in reverse order much like Memento.  Most of the revenge part takes place at the beginning of the film in a deep, dark, back alley, gay, S&M club aptly named ""Rectum"".  Now here's the rub again.  The hand held, poorly focused, poorly lit camera work combined with the strident, throbbing sound track gives the viewer the feeling they're in the ""Rectum,"" so to speak.  There is palpable feeling of anger, violence and disgust as you watch this movie.  You can almost feel the squish of splooge under your feet as the protagonist runs through the club seeking his revenge on the rapist.  This does have it's desired effect and is probably why some will consider this a masterpiece.  On the other hand, if I were a cleaver, right wing, conservative looking to attack the left from the left.  I would dress myself up as an ""artiste"", start speaking with a foreign accent, go out, and make this movie.  Simply because all your self-righteous, nose in the air, liberal, intelligencia patrons will herald you as the ""next great thing"" all the while you're sending out the message that homosexuals are a dirty, nasty, underground group of deviants that need to be driven out of the dark holes where they congregate and beaten to death.  The movie gets even more graphic as it moves backwards through time (which I didn't think could be possible).  I somehow struggled through the entire thing, uncomfortable and uneasy with every passing frame.  So, again the rub.  The movie was supposed to make you uncomfortable and it did.  It is an incredible piece of film making.  However, I have more respect for porn movies because they are, at least, honest about themselves. You know what you're getting into when you buy one. This movie dresses itself up in all the ersatz trappings of ""art"" and is still just porn with violence.  I personally think there are some things that simply don't need to be made into a movie and this is one of them.",1070236800,9,2850,4.525390625
1875369,4,B00008YNI2,"Already director Gasper Noe has established himself as one of the more brutal and shocking directors in the film spotlight, similiar in many ways to japenese director Takashi Miike (Audition).  Unlike Takashi, who's horror is more percise and articulate to give you a creepy feeling, Noe comes brutal, raw, not holding anything back.  The type of visual effect that leaves you putting your hand over your mouth in shock.  This is truely a violent and disturbing film.
Irreversible is more than just a shocking film with violent imagery.  The film is played backwards similiar to Christopher Nolan's Memento, though it's stylishly different then it.  The latter part of the film still stays very interesting even after the climax of the film which is near the beginning.  This was my major concern regarding the film before I watched it, but my worry was replaced with an intriguing storyline that kept my attention.  The technical part of the film was very refreshing, the shots were unique and lively.  The writing was sharp and the acting was very realistic.  The one aspect that Gasper Noe maintains throughout the film is it's human perspective.  No matter how sensative, violent, or burtal, the film never loses it's human beauty.  Even though human ugliness is not a new concept in cinema (even the greats like Kurosawa and Bergman dealt with this theme in really all their films), Noe shows us this light in a fresh and innovative view.  Almost too real of a view.

1875370,3,B00008YNI2,"By now, ""Irreversible"" is building a massive reputation for being a ultraviolent film and on this feature alone it's becoming one of the most known indie films of the year.
  The question whether it deserves this reputation in this respect should be answered with a thunderous yes. ""Irreversible"" is a film filmed backwards. It begins with a disturbing murder in an SM club, continues with the frantic search by a small mob for the person who gets killed and proceeds with probably the most unsubtle rape scene ever recorded on celluloid.
  But this french film actually has more things going for it. The camera work (far from the ""dramamine"" metaphors that others see) is brilliant. Photography and camera work go hand-in-hand as they build a dark doomy environ where the whole story keeps settling in geometrically. The cast is exceptionally picked as the actors come across perfectly as the everyday characters involved in a sudden nightmare.
  I personally don't understand why the graphic violence annoys certain people. The violence depicted in this film is but a mere fraction compared to the real, daily violence going on in the real world, and in most cases not far (if not right in) from our own neighborhoods. The bombardment -for example- of civilians is not ""annoying"" because the media try hard to hide it from the public but this film is? Lets be serious.
  Back to the film, i loved the way the landscape brightens as the film progresses to its end (which is of course the beginning) and as the colors open up as from a dommy eternal sunset to a colorful dawn, obviously the directors intent to emphasize contrast.
  The only minus in my opinion, was that the ""end"" was basically an anticlimax and for this it loses in my view a couple of stars. On one hand this is understandable keeping in mind that the rest of the film is super intimidating, but nevertheless, a different idea should've been used to climax the pivot of the story. It wasn't easy but the fact that it was predictable spoils an otherwise very good film.
  A disturbingly unsubtle addition to dark cinema.",1069372800,,2089,4.772222222222222
1875371,3,B00008YNI2,"This film is a teeming, glittering, sinuous ode to rape. It prettifies it, portraying the infamous offending piece cinema in womb like reds- this is not any attempt at graphic realism. This is definately not any kind of indictment of it, as some people have (stretching an interpretation or two) stated that it is. The 2001: A Space Odyssey intertext is unfortunately trite- was it a dream? Literally undoing a crime?- puhleeze- that's not insight, no 'poetic vision'. The film itself is a myopic, it does not reveal anything 'deep' (the reverse film artifice is SOOO obvious as to seem wholly gimmicky). That is what is fascinating about it. The charge and energy of an obvious exploitation film- unapologetic. To understand (some) people's fascination with cinema of the excessive, look no further than this.

What attracted me to a film with such power, is the complete non-censoredness of it. To tell a story of revenge, madness and love and lust is shown graphicaly yet, effectivly.

1875383,3,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible is a disturbing movie, and you can compare it to Cannibal Holocaust, Last House On The Left or Salo for the way it reflects violence. But Gaspar No's work is very good, because he tries to make the situations very real. There are a lot of scenes that will haunt you for days, maybe for weeks and months, and the last sequence may cause you a headache.
The image of the DVD is more clear that if you see the movie in a theater, specially in the now infamous extinguisher sequence (very well filmed), when one guy's face ends like the ones of that characters in Lord Of the Rings, those monsters who ara chasing Viggo Mortensen. The cinematography, editing, acting and soundtrack are very good. I recommend the movie a lot, but only to those who are prepared for it; you can close your eyes if you want to, but if you stay till the end, you'll be satisfied. You'll see a different movie.
Unfortunately, I have to say that the work of lions Gate on this DVD is BAD, BAD, REALLY BAD. There are no additional scenes, nor the making of the special effects. I sent an e-mail asking what happened to this material and they told me that they can't answer individual e-mails.

The back-to-front narrative is hardly interesting (although the film would have been totally run-of-the-mill without it), and the rape scene is precisely what you'd expect from a 9-minute single-take rape scene. Only those who walk into this film expecting it to be sunshine and farts will flee in terror, but never fear - you'll be shocked for the first fifteen minutes and that's all. The rest of the film is so nauseatingly ordinary and its last sequence so unbearably stupid that you'll mourn the fact that you've already witnessed the horrible things that are going to befall the characters.
A sequence involving a man whose head is smashed in with a fire extinguisher is exceptional (meaning that it's very well done) - but it's ultimately just another gimmick in this grab-bag of dumb art-house tricks.
I'd recommend renting it, but it's certainly not worth owning. Especially since its purpose is completely exhausted after a single viewing.",1067644800,6,1042,5.135294117647059

1875386,5,B00008YNI2,"I gave this film 5 stars because it's one of the most challenging films I've ever sat through. Any filmmaker with this much audacity and imagination has my attention. The credits roll in reverse (as in ""Kiss Me Deadly"") and the film does the same. It opens with a horrifying descent into a horrifying gay S&M club called the Rectum by a crazed Marcus (Vincent Cassel) searching for a character called Tenio (tapeworm) with his friend Pierre (Albert Dupontel) desperately trying to stop him. The camera work in this scene does gymnastics and is dizzying and uncomfortable. They find Tenio (or so they think) and when he breaks Marcus' arm, Pierre grabs a fire extinguisher and pulverizes the man's face. What follows are the events (in reverse) that lead up to this violent encounter including one of the most repulsive rape scenes I've ever seen in a film. I had to look away a couple of times. Marcus is in love with Alex (Monica Bellucci) who left Pierre for him. They're all still good friends. But at a party, Marcus does coke and gets out of hand causing Alex to walk out without him---leading to the vicious rape. All of this supposedly takes place over the course of a day and may or may not be a fantasy indulged in by Alex. Whatever your interpretation is of this film will no doubt influence whether you like it or not. The violence is incredible and stomach churning. Yet the film goes from all out horror to softer and softer scenes until it reaches a dream-like conclusion---which is actually the beginning. And therein lies the mystery. Was it all just a fantasy or was it real? The acting is excellent, especially Dupontel as Pierre who, as we see in reverse, goes from ballistic violence to an eloquent, gentle intellectual. Alex left Pierre because he wasn't exciting. So the fantasy aspect does have some credence. Anyway, viewers should beware the box warning of graphic violence. Once you get past this, if possible, ""Irreversible"" is a most curious film. But not for the squeamish.",1066694400,19,2002,4.722857142857142
1875387,5,B00008YNI2,"This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.
People that complain about the brutal rape scene need to wake up and face reality. The scene is not there for the sake of shock. The point that the director was trying to make is that rape is brutal and disgusting. Most hollywood movie makers do not have the guts to show horrible things in a realistic light. Perhaps after seeing this movie people will realize how horrible rape can be. Most guys just hear ""rape"" on the news and don't think about the violence associated with it. My wife couldn't watch the entire scene and I just fast-forwarded it. If you can't stomach it do the same.
Then there are people who complain about the camera movement in this movie which says to me they did not get the movie nor the point. Time is a central element and character of this movie. The constant motion represents time (as it never stands still). Besides the actors in this movie the director has effectively put another character of time into the movie. And the theme is that people always have to deal with time and choices and their irreversible nature. After watching this movie you will have a new way of looking at life (or perhaps re-affirm your beliefs already). Just to put things in perspective to current events - take a look at what happened to that poor Cubs fan in the playoffs. One second he is sitting at a baseball game, rooting for his favorite team, loving life, next second his whole world gets turned upside down because the ball came his way. In a split second his whole life changed because of chance, because of timing, and because of his decision.
Our actions and choices in life are irreversible - but do we really have a say in what happens to us or is it predetermined destiny? It's the old philosophical question brought to you in a chilling, sometimes disturbing, but most of all very beautiful movie.",1066608000,2,1884,4.495626822157434

The film is structured somewhat like ""Memento"" in that is is shown backwards. This is one of the redeming qualities of the film. The film opens with one of the most violent and realisitc looking scenes where a man is beaten with a fire extinguisher for sometime after he is alrady dead. His skull is smashed into what resembels a crushed melon. It seems like the ideas and and intesity of the film could have come across without all of this excessive brutality.

In a visual aspect, in the way the story line unfolds, in the acting, in the director's beautiful play with color, even in the accompanying soundtrack (which I also bought), the French-film flair for challenging its viewers while retaining a certain 'je ne sais quoi' is beautifull carried through.

1875415,5,B00008YNI2,"If you ever wanted to watch a man's face get smashed in, in the most
realistically possible way possible in a film?
Now here's your chance?
""Irreversible"" directed Gaspar Noe. (French)
I would place Irreversible on the same level as ""Funny Games"" and
""Confessions of a Serial Killer"".
Irreversible is a seriously [messed] up film, but does not exploit the
violence.
Without fail, you must watch this film, (by yourself, not with one of your
fiances, girlfriends, mothers, dates or grandmas!!!!!!)
Read my review below: (after you have watched it!)
First of all I want to thank my friend Tom, for recommending Gaspar Noe's
Irreversible. This was truly a stunning film in all aspects from the story,
to the visuals and much credit goes to actors for their incredible work. All
credit goes to Noe for his inventive and innovative vision. Some might
complain that the story structure is similar to Momento because of it's
reverse stoy line but to compare Irreversible to Momento would an insult.
Momento was clever where as Noe's film was dare I say, is on a genius level.
This is a director who understands film and has rewritten film to his own
language. The whole dizzying, spinning camera work through out the film was
his language to create even more tension and anxiety rather than just to
show off visually.
Momento is soda pop!
Irreversible is art.
The violence and the rape scene looked all too real, and that was the point,
not too pretty eh folks?
Probably the most tense beginning I have ever seen in a film and what a
soundtrack, that thumping beat went in sync with my erratic heartbeat!
(I loved the extras, the music extras on the dvd, ""Outrage"" is my
favourite.)
A dangerous film because we could identify with the main character's sense
of rage and wanting to act on revenge, but also a moral film because there
are choices in the way we act and the consequences of it. I saw the ending
(beginning) as how life could be and should be.....such as enjoying peace at
a nearby park or reading a damn good book as an alternative to violence in
life.
Heavy with the ""tunnel"" symbolism, perhaps representing, life, the mind and
the human anatomy?
Well, all I can say was ""WOW!""
I look forward to Noe's future cinematic visions",1064966400,3,2233,4.684478371501272
1875416,5,B00008YNI2,"Being a lover of unique and out of hand movies that prolong the need to artify and influence modern cinema, Irreversible is quite, one of the most a van-gard aggresive films of the past 10 years. It's dearness to expand the visions of the imagination is quite franctly, an awaking of the new french (and the world!) film noir era. Masterfully excuted by the great young filmmaker Gaspar Noe and featuring a unique and somehow, never seen before comera operation method, that aptent to make the viewer believe that the whole movie was made in one long and continuos shot, proves that intelligent filmmaking is not just a good or diferent script, but that could also be achived with interesting/ingenious cinematography and versatile camera acrobatics. Other people that has review the film here, has complained that the cinematography and the camera operation is un-cinematic, i disagree completly on that. The film was shot a very complex way trying to imitate a vortex or a maze ad even more confusion to the fusion. What is so uncinemathic about it. I rather watch this film a thounsan times than many of the other new films that feaure the same boring camera effects trying to copy those ""classic"" ( like many people will argue) tricks brought by the Matrix trilogy. For me, the definition of being un-cinemathic is NOT DEARING to change or add new ideas to art.
The memento thing is true. The film starts with the credits and ends on the title, the same way as the film. It stars horrendously, yet beautifully confusing and ends up in one of the must poetic and artistic shots in recent memory. The use of color in the film is just amazing!!!
The first half of the film is strong, quite disgusting, shoking and incredibly disturbing, so purchase with discresion. Being a lover of strong and disturbing films like The Audition, Red to Kill, The untold story, Baise moi and lotz of ultra gory, deranged and explotation classics, I could say that I have seen it all and that I have the stomach and the brain to sit through any ""disturbing"" film, but I have to admit that the first half of this film is hard to watch, but at the same time is simply amazing.

1875417,3,B00008YNI2,"There are a couple of things I really liked about this film. I like the way the director plays with the conventional notion of the ""happy ending"" and I thought the acting here was supurb. However, the problem with this film is that it is ultimately a simplistic story that is ""spiced"" up with some over-the-top violence. This is a revenge story that, if told forward, would be dull and depressing. It is funny how many of the reviews here try to justify the violence in this film as adding to the story. That is ridiculous because the violence here is sensationalistic-- pure and simple. Would the story have changed if the guy was killed with a gun instead of having his head smashed in? Would a 2 minute rape scene have been any less effective than a 10 minute one? Did the club that they went to at the beginning need to be an s&m club that is perhaps the most demeaning portrayal of gay men that I have ever seen? The answer to all these questions is ""no"". The power of suggestion is much stronger than seeing a human head being reduced to a pancake. This film is very juvenille in many respects. I did enjoy it more than not while watching it-- but, after reflecting on it for a while, I have concluded that it is a pretty empty and soulless film.",1064361600,3,1252,4.3319148936170215
1875418,5,B00008YNI2,"Gaspar Noe's Irreversible is an unforgettable film and one that is guaranteed to provoke a strong reaction. The first half of the film is so bleak and unpleasant that it's almost oppressive. Though it's not exactly a horror film itself, this film is darker and scarier than most horror films. Depicting a brutal head-bashing murder in a dingy hellish nightclub, and a vicious violent rape in the first forty-five minutes, it's difficult to watch and may be too much for most audiences. These scenes will not leave your head for a long time.
The film unfolds in backwards chronological order, similar to Memento. More than just a simple gimmick, this structure adds even more depth to the experience. The main theme of the film seems to be choices that we make and the irreversible consequences of them. By having the film sequenced in reverse, we actually see the consequence before we see the choice. I agree with what Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Irreversible, saying that our present happiness depends on not knowing what will happen in the future. In this film we see the horrible, horrible circumstances that the characters are going to find themselves in. In the second half of the movie, when we see them in happier times, we know what is going to happen while they do not. This just makes it seem all the more tragic the way things turn out.
The style of the film can be a bit much at times. In some scenes, the camera moves all over the place almost making The Blair Witch Project look relatively still in comparison. It's quite a cinematographic achievement, but it does call attention to itself. In contrast, during the rape scene the camera is completely still and does not cut away, presumably to force us to focus on what is happening onscreen.
Irreversible is a fascinating film which will have you glued to the screen and also, at times, wanting to look away. It's powerful, well-made, brilliant and unforgettable. However, the first half of the film is mercilessly grimy, unsettling and dark giving nearly the most unpleasant feelings that this reviewer has ever had in a movie. It's not all that way, however, and the second half of the film shows the couple (Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel) in happier times and significantly lightens up. Irreversible is not at all for the squeamish but for those who can stomach it, it's an exhilarating cinematic experience.",1064275200,5,2388,4.784503631961259
1875419,3,B00008YNI2,"aspects of this film are brilliant - the way sound and camera work to produce a churning sense of disorientation really affected me, and i guess that's the point in a world where we can imagine there is little we have not seen.  there were parts of this film i could not watch, and the commentary in these reviews about the ability to ""handle"" the violence is pretty childish - or reflects the same impulse of sadistic machismo that drives the film.  my sense was that this was an intensely personal portrait of rage, and it took me places i really did not want to go. the film uses a range of techniques to encode realism, which is not to say that the film is any more real than what hollywood produces.  to cite the rape in the film as ""realistic"" is beside the point - it is graphic and horrifying, which rape is, but within a mediaculture which increasingly eroticises rape it would be a mistake to imagine that this film provides the ""authentic"" version (and thus some rapes really are erotic). this is a haunting and unpalatable film, and it saddens me that some viewers think their ability to consume this imagery is noble or clever.",1063497600,2,1140,4.471153846153846
1875420,5,B00008YNI2,"When the opening credits came on the screen for this wildly violent 2002 thriller, I though there was something wrong with the disk because some of the letters were backwards.  The film is in French and it wasn't until the film actually started and the captions were clear and easy to read that I realized that these reversed letters were just a foreshadowing of what to expect in the film.  It was going to start at the end and wind up at the beginning.
The writer/director, Gaspar Noe, made his creative choices wisely.  The twelve scenes unfold to the viewer with a concept in mind.  We first see an exceptionally brutal scene in which two men, Vincent Casel and Albert Dupontel, force their way into a gay sex club in search of one particular man.  They are furious and looking for revenge.  The camera slides along the darkened walls capturing the steamy atmosphere of casual intimate encounters until the two angry men finally think they've found the person called ""La Tenia"".  What follows is a cruel and bloody bashing in of the victim's skull that is so graphic that it was difficult to watch.
As the film continues we learn that La Tenia is the rapist of a woman they both loved.  And still later we see the violent assault upon her.  Monica Belluci is cast as the woman and she certainly is beautiful. The attack is an awful scene to watch and goes on for a full ten minutes.  It was horrible and sadistic and the most violent scene I have ever seen.
And then we see the trio in happier times, enjoying themselves at a party.  As each scene develops we learn more and more about them as human beings.  This is difficult to watch because we all know the aftermath.  We also know that there is no going back to happier times.  The deeds have been done and there is no way to stop them.  It's quite an unsettling feeling, especially in the final frame when there is love and joy and so much hope for the future.
This is not a film for everyone.  There's incredible cruelty and ugliness.  And there are scenes that will make you want to turn your head away.  This feeling never lets up.  All my senses were shocked in this whirlwind of action.  I was horrified and upset and very moved.  And I couldn't stop watching.  The film is a small work of art and I highly recommend it.  However, it is only for the very courageous few.  All others stay away.",1063497600,5,2357,4.4153132250580045
1875421,3,B00008YNI2,"""Irreversible,"" the new film from French director Gaspar Noe, is a crude revenge fantasy dressed up as an art-house film.  As the movie begins with the ending credits, it tells its sordid story in reverse a la ""Memento,"" and the camera jitters during each scene so nervously, you'll be reaching for your Dramamine within just minutes.  Its hero, Marcus (Vincent Cassell), seeks to avenge the savage rape of his girlfriend Alex (the attractive Monica Bellucci), and in so doing, he begins a violent journey that leads him into a sleazy gay club called, of all things, the Rectum.  ""Irreversible"" has quickly gotten a reputation for being one of the most visually graphic movies ever made.  Having seen this movie, I can testify that its reputation is well earned.  One scene involves a man getting beaten (literally) to a pulp with a fire extinguisher; the beating is so relentless that it's impossible not to squirm even once.  But the more unsettling scene involves the nine minute rape of Alex, which has to be the most horrific depiction of violence I've ever witnessed on a screen.  While many people reportedly bolted out of theatres during this scene, I saw the whole thing in its entirety.  (Then again, your stomach may be not as strong, so think hard before you see this movie.)  It's a long and agonizing sequence that leaves almost nothing to imagination, and it's at this point where most people stop watching ""Irreversible.""  But while Noe is a talented stylist with the camera, the script has flaws.  Prior to her rape, Alex is not only dressed in a skin-tight dress but also approaches a poorly-lit subway station after dark.  I find it hard to believe that most women in the 21st century would use such incredibly poor judgment.  Also, the film's subplot involving the club carelessly aligns homosexuality with sleazy behaviour.  ""Irreversible"" is certainly intriguing, but it's pretty tough for me to recommend as a purchase.  Who would buy this DVD?  Considering its nasty content, this isn't a movie you'll want to watch multiple times.  You won't be scanning back and forth to certain chapters to re-watch ""favorite"" scenes.  But if you've got the iron stomach for an ugly thriller done with interesting camerawork, then ""Irreversible"" might be worth a look--provided you'll be able to keep both eyes open.",1062806400,7,2326,4.93573264781491

1875434,5,B00008YNI2,"O.K., let me just start by saying that i'm tired of seeing all these reviews here on Amazon!  Blah, blah, blah, there is no need to show so much violence, blah, blah, blah, there is enough violence in the real world and we know it exists, blah, blah, blah.  Listen, printed on the front of this dvd in big letters is WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC SEX AND VIOLENCE.  So if you don't want to see this type of film then don't buy it and don't watch it.  Instead, sit down with the family, a big bowl of popcorn and watch The Wizard Of Oz!!!
  Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.  Now for the people who actually like this type of film, this is one of the most brutal, gut wrenching films i've ever seen.  Kudos to Gasper Noe on such a brillant masterpiece.  Let me just say that I love Indie films and classic gore films(I have over 200 in my collection)so I am not a novice when it comes to this type of genre.  Check out my other reviews on films such as Ilsa-She Wolf Of The SS, Boise Moi, Tim Roth's The War Zone, etc.  I love Lucio Fulci, and of course the godfather of horror, Dario Argento.  My point is that i'm pretty much jaded when it comes to shocking or disturbing material, and Irreversible is one that will stay with me for a long time.
  I loved this film for many reasons but mainly because how much Noe makes you feel involved with the main characters.  Since it's told in reverse you don't feel this way right away, but you will.  I'm not going to get into the whole plot line because so many others have already done that for me.  What i'm really here to say is that this is a very REAL movie.  Like it all is really happing right before our eyes and we need to stick around to find out what happens.  Noe's vision is surperb, and in his own way very artistic.  I'm tellin' ya, see this film.
  There are a couple things I would like to point out that some other reviewers failed to elaborate on.  For those of you who saw Noe's previous film, I Stand Alone, I was wondering if anyone got the opening sequence of this film.  The movie opens with two guys talking in a small apartment upstairs from the club where the murder takes place.  Did anyone realize that it's the guy from I Stand Alone, and that he is still in character from that film?  His is telling the other guy that he was locked up for having sex with his daughter.  To me is was like leaving off of I Stand Alone and going right into Irreversible.  Excellent touch!!!!
  Also, in some of the other reviews, some made it sound like there was a sort of triumph to this film, or that justice was done.  That is so untrue.  There is no happy ending here, the good guys don't win.  I mean sure, the guy who rapes Alex and beats Marcus to a bloody pulp with only half of his face left(there will be no open casket for him) does get arrested, but if you were into the characters as much as I was, you really wanted to see this pr*%k, at the least, get tortured to death or set on fire or something.  So to me there was no justice.
  Anyway, if you want to see a movie that will leave a lasting impression in your head then pick this one up.  It may not be a happy impression, but a impression none-the-less.  I am so tired of the senseless dribble that comes out of Hollywood these days.  All these big corporate movies with big name stars that when the movie is over, you feel like you just wasted 2 hours of your life.
  Is it just me or don't people notice that most of the films made these days are geared tward teenie-boppers, or movies that are PC?  I'm glad to see that there are still directors out there that have the balls to make a film thats over the top, or geared to the adult viewer.  Even if we have to get them from somewhere like France!!!  NEVER FORGET 9/11/01!!!!",1061769600,3,3761,4.149584487534626
1875435,5,B00008YNI2,"IRREVERSIBLE starts off with erratic nervous energy and nearly unbearable violence, which unwinds (since the plot presents the story in reverse) to a meditative, mandala-like epiphany.  Hard to say whether the story would have worked as well chronologically (I doubt it), but as it is, the film comments intelligently on revenge, masculinity/femininity, the sex-and-violence connection, and, most of all, the vanity of human wishes.  The highlights of the film are two long and excrutiating scenes of brutal violence.  But there are equally impressive quiet moments--such as the desperate and witty subway conversation on what makes for ""good sex"" and a tender, matter-of-fact love scene between the film's charismatic stars Vincent Cassel and Monica Belluci, who have never been better.  Any warnings you have received about the ghastliness of the fight scene and rape scene that dominate the film should not be taken lightly.  Still, the film has more to offer than shock effects and gore, and it is as serious a contemplation of the human condition as you are likely to see on film.",1061337600,,1085,5.212643678160919
1875436,3,B00008YNI2,"""Irreversible"" is a very difficult film to watch. For starters, the jerky hand-held shooting of the first reel is a test of your stomach. It's as violent as it is dizzying. If you can survive this portion of the film, you'll be able to endure the rest. If you manage to do that, you'll witness a truly unique film experience.
Told in reverse chronological order, its similarity to ""Memento"" stops there. Here it works extremely well -- definitely more than a gimmick. It works so well in fact that if ""Irreversible"" were told in standard order, the film would be very unsatifying.
In addition to the opening, the film features a graphic rape scene that effectively shows its brutality.
Overall, ""Irreversible"" is a great film for someone that wants to see something that is really different. However, it is so harrowing and brutal, that you probably will not want to see it a second time. You've been warned.",1061164800,,908,4.753164556962025
1875437,2,B00008YNI2,"I'm a veteran of disturbing cinema and I was expecting a grueling experience -- heck, the dramatic opening credits nearly had me too intimidated to continue watching -- but ultimately the story itself was too simplistic to be truly disturbing, and I was left wondering what the aims were of the film's creator, Gaspar Noe. I'd also seen another of Noe's films (I Stand Alone) and I've now concluded that has nothing to say. He aspires to become merely a notorious director of shocking material. My guess is that his creative ""method"" involves simply conjuring up some suckerpunch scene (in the case of Irreversible, there are two) and throwing together sufficient character and plot to make the scene happen. It's revealing to me that the camera swirls and twists -- almost nauseatingly so -- throughout the whole of Irreversible, but remains static in only one scene (the excruciatingly long rape sequence), as though to suggest that this was the only scene that mattered, the only one worth framing properly. Noe is an exploitation filmmaker, but in a world where no one pays attention to shock filmmakers anymore (after all, Perry Farrell said that nothing was shocking fifteen years ago), Noe is forced to imbue his unpalatable material with moral outrage just to get people to pay attention to it. But there is no moral here. Rape is nonsensical. Revenge is nonsensical. The world is cruel. We all knew this going in. I'm reminded of what one critic said about Marilyn Manson: ""There's nothing as lame or pitiful as contrived outrage, and no band around fails to shock with as much concerted effort as Marilyn Manson."" Same goes for Gaspar Noe. If you want to see something really shocking, try Takashi Miike's Audition. Now there's a suckerpunch.",1061164800,22,1752,4.922297297297297

1875439,3,B00008YNI2,"Brutal.
Irreversible is similar to Momento in that the story is told in reverse. We see the final scene, then we go back to the scene before the final scene, and so on. Considering the subject matter of the movie is an extremely violent murder and a disgusting rape, the telling in reverse is a good thing since we don't leave the movie with the graphic images fresh on our minds.
But the memories will remain.
What's really brutal about this movie isn't the murder or rape, it's the filmmaking! In order to get across the ""out of control"" feeling the characters have to the audience, the director filmed the first (or would that be the last?) 30 minutes of the movie without the aid of a tripod. It's actually much worse than that as the camera man actually spins the camera around... side spinning, front spinning... there's a lot of spinning. If you're prone to motion sickness keep the pause button handy!
If you can survive the first 30 minutes the movie is worth watching. The story is interesting and thought provoking. I don't suggest watching this one with any females present though as the rape scene is quite, well, brutal.",1060473600,,1134,4.618811881188119
1875440,5,B00008YNI2,"Before I begin... Has anyone else noticed that you cannot access the 'Making of Special Effects' feature that is prominently advertised on the US Region 1 DVD?
Rape happens.  It happens to someone, somewhere in the world, every minute of every day.  To avert your eyes is to deny that it exists in your world.  To turn away is to shirk responsibility.  This film is truthful in it's depiction of that horror and the feelings of vengeance that inevitably follow.  There will be those that are repulsed by this film, a film that can make 'Requiem for a Dream' seem like a little girl's fairytale.  If you are one of those who refuse to watch 'Irreversible' or one who watches and is offended... then you are living in a fake fairytale world of your own.  This great French film is as brutally truthful and poignant as any in recent memory.  It is one of the saddest films I have ever seen.  And yet, because of it's reverse chronology, the final scenes of blissful romanticism are some of the most beautiful and heartbreaking moments ever committed to the silver screen.  This is a courageous and magnificent artistic achievement!
'Irreversible' unfolds backwards, much like 2001's 'Memento'.  It's not a gimmick...  far from it.  The film begins with the revenge beating of a suspected rapist.  It is a savage and relentless scene that will make many squirm.  It is as graphic and violent a scene as could be imagined, and at the end, you will feel like you were the one who had their skull crushed in.  And because we have no real idea who these characters are, there is a sense that this is gratuitous and pointless violence.  Then we go back in time just a few minutes to the search for the rapist and watch as the frenzy of revenge consumes a man who is bent on justice for the rape of his girlfriend.  The next scene is the rape itself.  It is a soul-crushing scene of relentless intensity that seems to drag on forever.  It makes the earlier beating scene seem rather tame and almost justified.  And the film continues to track time in reverse to the beginning of a seemingly innocuous day filled with hope and love and tenderness.  But of course, unlike the characters, we are painfully aware of what awaits them as the day unfolds.  It is tear-inducingly sad to watch these people drift toward an irreversible destiny.
Monica Bellucci is astonishingly brave.  This performance is as courageous and accomplished as Diane Lane's role in last year's thriller 'Unfaithful'.  She should be decorated with every award there is for her role as Alex.  She is terrifyingly scared and desperately sympathetic in the rape scene... but her best work comes later in the film (earlier in the day) as she shares some tender moments with her lover (Cassel) and some funny moments with an ex-boyfriend.  The final twenty minutes of the movie are all a showcase for her... a chance for her to show that she is capable of magnificent subtlety and tremendous range.  The bedroom scene with Bellucci and her real life husband, Vincent Cassel, is as realistic and honest as you will ever see.  There is no need for added sentiment or melodrama... only truth.  Their interaction is spectacular in these moments.
'Irreversible' is a film about many things: The Relentlessness of Time; The Cruelty of Karma; The Inevitability of Destiny; The Natural Tendency of Revenge; The Randomness of Luck; The Sadness of Truth.  I could go on and on.  This film doesn't give us convention.  It says that sometimes bad things happen to good people.  It shows that fortune sometimes smiles on evil (Try to remember every face you see!).  The movie doesn't perpetuate our need for fakery and fairytales.  Bad things happen... but time will destroy that too.
As the film tells us over and over... ""Time destroys everything.""
Director Gaspar No and his cast have created a great film... one that should be seen by everyone, especially those that don't want to!  This film has the ability to change you... and how many times can you say that about your typical fluffy Hollywood fairytale?  This is a masterpiece!

This however wasn't the case in Irreversible.  I've never felt so sick and nauceous and shaken up from a film.  By the end I was on the verge of crying from all the evil acts that just unfolded in front of me, so naturally, I watched the film again.  For a film to be capable of bringing all that emotion out of me, for me, that's a masterpiece.  However, I don't recommend this to a majority of the people out there, I'd be surprised if most could make it through the first 20 minutes, but if you think you can handle a film that consists of an extremely brutal raping and a death that will be in your head for years to come, go ahead, watch it, but if you prefer to keep these images out of your head, don't.

`Irreversible' starts at the end, with a shocking killing, and then goes backwards to tell the story leading up to the opening scene
There has been much controversy surrounding this film due to it's extremely graphic nature.  While there is full nudity from both main stars Monica Bellucci, and Vincent Cassel, it is  nothing compared to the extreme violence in the film.  The controversial rape scene is horrible to watch, but nothing in comparison to the sex club head-bashing scene, this scene is so brutal it takes your breath away.
Now that the controversial topics are out of the way, the film itself is a powerful piece of film making, complete with trendy styling, and strong performances from Bellucci and Cassel, and should be viewed for such.
`Irreversible' is definitely NOT for everyone, but those braver viewers in search of a new style film should give it a try.

1875454,4,B00008YNI2,"'IRREVERSIBLE' starts as an attack on what film ""should"" be with credits running in reverse, sliding around, and at the end of the film.  The effect here is less for the cool factor (as it is in the film 'SEVEN') and more to disrupt audience levels of acceptability.  In fact, the whole film pushes the audience to question what is ""acceptable"" and what is not.  This is not exploitation, however, but aggressive art, art which is meant to challange, provoke, and stay with you long after the film is over.
The plot has been discussed elsewhere so I won't harp on that.  Needless to say, the film starts in a circle in Dante's Hell, moves upward through a Purgatorio, and almost, but not quite, gets to Heaven.  But the film is told in reverse.  ""Time destroys all"" is the motto, and indeed, because ""Heaven"" is at the beginning and ""Hell"" at the end, the film isn't a romantic parable on coincidence but rather an essay on/for/in search of Nihilism; Nihilism is tragic, Hence, this film is a tragedy. It's best if the film is viewed as a Horror/Love/Pro-Feminist story.
The acting in the film is as perfect as the deft camerawork/cinematography.  Monica Bellucci should especially be praised for taking on what is surely one of the most difficult scenes any actress has been asked to perform on film.  The infamous rape is done with such artistry and integrity that it is never sensational & exploitative; The violence is always real and vivid, never forgettable, and is (the violence) far above and beyond the frivolous ""human bodies as toys/trash"" shown in films like 'GLADIATOR' and 'TERMINATOR 3'.  Here, violence is never romantic nor chic and for this Noe deserves any and all credit he gets.
This film is along the same in-your-face, intellectual horror films as 'SALO: 120 DAYS OF SODOM', 'VIDEODROME' and 'HELLRAISER', films where the killer is not some masked voyeur but rather the ""Killer"" is time, destiny, circumstance, and the human disposition towards violence as it fulfills personal/political/psychological desires & a need to transgress.
For a better understanding/appreciation of 'IRREVERSIBLE'check out the above mentioned but also give a read to Georges Bataille's ""EROTISME"" and ""THE TORTURE GARDEN"" by Octave Mirabeau (also some Maurice Blanchot wouldn't be bad).
I give the film 4.75 but not 5 because Noe hasn't quite made his masterpiece...but he's very, very close.  While not a film for everyone, if you can mentally & physically handle 'IRREVERSIBLE' you'll experience what art can & ""should"" be.

However, this means that some of the things you get are so characteristically french, and i don't mean to be anti-french, but just to comment on a theme that's unfortunately is too pervasive in french movies. Examples are the chit-chat about sex in the tube, only french people would have such a chit-chat with such a choice of topic and such expressed opinions. And only french people would bother put it on film. Unfortunately, if you've seen enough french movies you'll get pretty bored with too much emphasis on sex, and things will feel repetitive and redundant.
The violence is sorta extreme, it's probably the worst one can think of. Newsweek said this was the most walked-out-of movie of the year, and true to its reputation i think a third to a half of the audience walked out of the theatre after that scene.
The rape scene is labouriously prolonged, a little too prolonged that even an actress like monica belluci seemed at times not entirely sure how she should be acting.
Overall, you can't help but feel the movie, in its extremism and deliberate intent to shock, is nothing more than the product of a very jovenile mind, in a very french way, which, knowing how extreme the french can be, only means annoying jovenile.",1059696000,7,1397,4.637096774193548

b. Violence - yes, the first scene in the bar was truly violent, and also the tunnel [assault] scene, not graphically violent, but the 10+ minutes non-stop-without-a-cut scene was very blunt.
c. Monica Bellucci - yes, she was very beautiful, sexy as ever.

The sixties decor of the lover's flat which I took to be a subtext of the permissivness of the sixties leading to ultimate disaster may be no more than a tribute to the director's favourite director.

1875461,3,B00008YNI2,"Irreversible?This is a key theme in this film where the scenes unfold in reverse chronological order,a technique that, apart from being irritating,just doesn't work as a film. I can only assume that it looked good as a script! Just so you know.
I was anxious to see the film which caused hundreds of  viewers to storm out of the Cannes premiere and was also the biggest crisis for the emergency services in 25 years of Cannes-there were several panic attack victims.
This has to be pretty rough stuff i told myself on settling down to watch the film.
Anyone who doesn't know the plot of the film can stop reading now(and don't say i ruined it for you later!).Basically a classy french girl is the unfortunate victim of a brutal(and it is sick) rape which leads to all sorts of recriminations-or does it?
A brief summary,perhaps,but that's essentially it.
Given the propensity of french film makers to be different and weird,the back to front format of the film adds absolutely nothing to the plot-you could watch the scenes as the story was meant to be and enjoy it more easily.
The opening credits roll  back to front-like the film Seven,which is a bit sinister,apart from anything else. The eerie(almost) monotone music continues throughout the first(or final)scene and frankly goes on too long-a technique which fails in this scene but adds to the rape scene where the voyeuristic camerawork builds apprehension which is almost worse than the act itself-always assuming,of course,that you know what's coming.
It's possible that you might check out this film as a Monica Bellucci fan but her elegance and beauty in this film only disarms the viewer and doesn't prepare you for the brutality to follow. I've probably understated the case but this is a very violent film at times and is definitely not for everyone.
The critics seem to be in two camps-they either denounce director Gaspar Noe as a sick puppy or hail him as an innovative filmmaker.
I think this is an interesting film. It is,however,essential to have an idea of what's coming-you'll be far too shocked otherwise. I also wonder about the motives of a director who has been quoted as saying that he's always wanted to film a rape scene. Why,Gaspar,why!!!!?

1875472,1,B00008YNI2,"I just can't help myself.  I must dive into this ""controversy"" and inflict my opinion on anyone willing to read it.  First off there is a fundamental question  which has been at the heart of many a film debate.  Salom (120 days in Sodom) had a similar reaction, as did a clockwork orange, Natural Born Killers and on and on.  Is it right to illustrate the evil of the world by using an unflinching view, to show it in all it's gruesome reality so we are appropriately disgusted?  Does such filmmaking make us more sensitive to the suffering of others, or are we desensitized by seeing it as play acting?  Someone much more intelligent then myself will have to answer that.  I have taken many a film class and am told when writing my reaction I cannot simply say ""It [was bad]""  but never has a phrase more aptly fit my reaction.  It truly [was bad].  Hard.  First off we are treated to an inane philosophy by what appear to be to older homosexuals (homosexuals play a large part in this film, I cannot see why) who say there are no good or bad deeds, just deeds.  Profound huh?  If this is the case then the camera work that soon follows is ""just a deed"" too, a bad deed.  We are shown the inside of a place called the ""rectum""  Ho Ho Ho, there are a large collection of pathetic homosexual characters engaged in various repulsive acts that make me almost grateful for the gawdawfull shaky cam, rotating cam [stuff] that goes on for at least 10 minutes, it seems like days.  This is boring, pretentious, unoriginal and serves to illustrate the filmmakers are A. Inexperienced film school kids showing up there stogy old professors B. Pretentious snobs who think such nonsense is powerful instead of annoying and pointless.  C. Morons.  I would opt for C, that would be the least offensive. In addition to the shaky, rolling camera nonsense, the same phrase is repeated over and over and over and over and over again, the point is made and made and made.....you get the point.  A murder takes place, a revolting one, by this time such things are expected so it was not all that shocking, add to this the fact that it consisted of a fire extinguisher being smashed into someone's head, over and over and over again, on and on blah blah blah, what in the name of creation was this all about?  Who knows and who cares, not me.  After this opening scene we see what these guys are all about, it ain't much.  Ponderous camera work punctuated by gratuitous and badly filmed violence, the infamous rape scene is done almost exclusively by, what appears to be, a camera sitting on the ground and left running.  Of course we got to see a lovely young actress who has been so good in other films sexually violated and then her pretty face gets smashed to pieces.  That's entertainment?  Is the point that brutally assaulting a young women and destroying her face is, in fact, wrong?  Thank you so much for pointing that out, where would we be without such genius filmmakers to show us the way.  Better off.  The idea of showing the film backwards is good accept for the fact that it really doesn't work.  Memento worked because the pieces were scattered around in some order but to a have a linear tale told backwards is fundamentally flawed because, obviously we would have to have all the action in reverse, so the events are told backwards and filmed forwards then we jump to what would have happened before,,,oh who cares.  Turns out this young women was intelligent, kind and looking forward to having a child, nice touch.  Yes we have all learned a valuable lesson, don't rape people and smash there faces in....or something.",1053475200,23,3620,4.53858024691358

1875474,1,B00008YNI2,"Irrversible is packed with sex and violence, which can usually be used quite well in cinema.  In this case there was way too much violence to cover up a weak directoral ability to depict plot.  For instance, there is a rape scene that last for about 3-5 minutes and I feel the graphic content of said does not add value to the movie.  I am a fan of action movies, and never shy away, but it was too much this time.",1052870400,2,414,4.08641975308642
1875475,5,B00008YNI2,"I have not seen a film this thoroughly gratifying for a long time. Every time I pay to see a film I feel as though I've been stripped of my money. Before this film, the last film that I enjoyed as much was Amelie, which is a completely different film, and I haven't seen anything satisfying since.
Irreversible takes the same chronologically reverse format as over-hyped and under performing ""Memento"", a movie that I did not enjoy because there was no reason for it to go in reverse. It was all a gimmick to cover up the fact that the story was weak. But Irreversible makes it work. In the first 10 minutes of this film about 10 people left the theater, which I consider a thinning of the herd. This film is definitely not for the squeamish. I pride myself for not being shocked by anything in films, and this film really got my attention.
In the opening scene of the film, which is the climax, the camera is all hand-held and seem seems never to cut, or move away from the action. It is amazingly violent and disturbing, but not gratuitously. Gaspar Noe, the director, does not shy away from showing the underground world of ""The Rectum"" in its true form. Watching the opening moments I felt as though this was my incarnation of hell. The scene ends with Marcus and Pierre (Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel) violently murder a man with a fire extinguisher. Usually in movies the camera pans away and we hear what's going on, but in this case, the camera catches everything.
As the movie progresses back in time to the momentous rape of Alex (the angelic Monica Bellucci), the camera sits on the floor and captures the entire rape in one take, one angle, without ever cutting away. It is by far the most honest and chilling rape scene I have ever seen. Alex (Monica) is a supremely seductive, powerful and independent woman, who is dually vulnerable and delicate. Her emotional transformation in this moment, the fear and apprehension of loss of life is apparent in Monica's facial expressions and her non-acting style of acting.
The camera seems to be a witness of Alex's bargaining with the rapist pimp, Le Tenia (Jo Prestia), to her beating, and the long-lasting rape. By the end of that scene, I felt as though I was rapped. The dialogue is as true as I can imagine it to be in such a situation, and throughout the entire film.
Towards the end of the film, or the chronological beginning, we see Alex and her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent) waking up in their apartment and having a very casual and intimate conversation, without rushing through it. And without saying anything about the plot of the film, it reveals so much about the two characters and their relationship together.
The film ends with a bird's eye view of Alex reading a book at a park with children playing around her. The camera spins in circles and gives a feeling of such tranquility, a major contrast from the start of the film.
This film stayed with me for an entire week and I dreamt about it that night. I recommend this film thoroughly to anyone who can stomach honesty in violence. There isn't a trace of Hollywood in this film and I think that says it all.",1051833600,30,3136,4.552212389380531

It's well made, well acted (dupontel was fine, vincent cassel was good, as usual). But my god...after the rape scene I had the urge to fast forward the movie. The film is flat, offers nothing interresting. I don't see what Gaspar Noe was trying to show. It all looks like a very nice marketing experiment.

A hint: if you appreciated 'Once Upon a Time in America' - you should be well-prepared. The hard-hitting sequence of brutal acts in the beginning of the movie is undoubtedly to make you, the viewer, suffer with the victims IRREVERSIBLY. And there is no way around it, unless you want a film about something else. The director is thoughtful enough, though, to make it reversible, at least for us, by flipping the time backwards. This film is about the oldest collisions of humanity: temptation by evil, paradise lost and suffering of innocents. It is very compassionate, even poetic, and has zero cynicism. In short, it is a moral tale told the way that makes you GET IT. A+!",1050624000,4,806,4.723404255319149

I believe in the beauties of this World but I'm not blind. I know where Evil can make its nest...in the heart of Males!
That's what ""Irrversible"" is about.
Gaspar No tells us so, in his own special unconfortable way. We can't bear him a grudge for that...he is an Artist!
See ""Irrversible"" twice!
One time for the physical shock and a second time for the emotional and symbolic side.
""Irrversible"" stinks, but this is the smell of Life!

1875480,1,B00008YNI2,"The recent acclaim for Gaspar Noe's new film ""Irreversible"" is clearly a case of the emperors new clothes.  The controversial film starts off as an assault on the senses but quickly fizzles out and becomes an exercise in tedium.  Due to the reverse order storytelling gimmick, this top heavy film falls victim to its own theme - time destroys everything - and ultimately collapses under its own weight.  Aside from the early scenes of brutality (a graphic head bashing & the infamous 10 anal rape) the film offers little else - least of all anything resembling complexity or psychological insight.  Instead, Noe presents scene after scene of meaninglessly contrived after-the-fact foreshadowing, self indulgent film student aesthetics and laughably amateur (not to mention excruciatingly dull) actor workshop improvisations - some of which make the endless rape scene feel subliminal.  What Noe seems to be aiming for is a kind of Peckinpah/Cassavetes hybrid, but what he attains is the cinematic equivalent of anesthesia.

Yes, there is a rape scene that seems like it was really happening, and is VERY hard to watch. Was it worth paying $9 to see? My answer: Not that I am into sadistic violence or cruelty, but I saw it twice.
The way this story is told in reverse order from ugliness to serenity is what entices me the most about this film. Noe is really communicating something here that I feel everyone should see, as shocking and intense as it is.
The camera work here is fantastic, the acting equally fantastic. I applaud Gaspar Noe for having the courage to produce a film this bold and moving. I won't see a film this engaging for quite some time. It only played at the local Landmark theatre for two short weeks. Bring on the DVD.

It starts with the camera spinning back and forth, which I suppose is meant to induce a sense of disorientation or confusion into the audience. Well, it works. In fact, it works so well it made me motion sick, so I had to give up on watching the movie after just a few minutes. I even checked further into the movie and the same camera style was still being used.

I understand some directors like to resort to unconventional means to elicit certain emotional states in the audience, but the Blair-Witch-style camera action was overdone, and I don't feel it's ever necessary in a movie. There are better ways to present a feeling of disorientation while maintaining a steady shot.
