8739735,1,B017MGJ0KU,"The film is a fine film.  Shoot 'em, punch 'em, blow 'em up.  The problem is the disc quality is suspect and misrepresented.  This is NOT close to even hi def, much less blu-ray or 4K.  Standard definition at best.  The image is grainy and the coloring is garbage.  Ripoff.",1512864000,2,273,4.36

8739737,2,B017MGJ0KU,"This package comes with the standard blu ray version and the 4k blu ray version on seperate discs. The movie is a decent movie if you like action flics and the all star cast. No gripes there. However the transfer quality of both discs leaves much to be desired. The movie has a very heavy grain, that on standard blu ray makes it almost unwatchable on a 4k television. The 4k version doesnt have as much grain, but lacks the detail you would see in many other 4k discs (chappie, hacksaw ridge, etc).  I threw in the blu ray version of expendables 1 just to compare. The picture quality had less grain, was more detailed than standard blu ray version of expendables 2, but slightly less detail than the 4k. So basically the 4k transfer of expendables 2, is only slightly more detailed than standard blu ray of first movie. The movie has a lot of dark colors, so not much opportunity for hdr to pop. Bascially as 4k movies go, unless you really like this movie, I would pass.",1506729600,3,973,4.405555555555556
