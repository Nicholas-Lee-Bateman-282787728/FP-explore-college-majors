2894867,1,B000T5P3VM,"Not only is this dvd not the original ""300 Workout"" but the well touted 300 Workout which can be found on line was not an actual ""work out"".  It was a fitness TEST which member's of the cast/stuntmen could take once evaluated to be in good enough shape at the end of their training for the film.  Not only is there no such thing as a 300 workout done by the cast of the film, but any good trainer should be good enough at what they do to know that.",1201132800,5,448,3.966666666666667
2894868,5,B000T5P3VM,"Steve Maxwell takes you through a circuit of ten exercises that use just body weight and a pull up bar.  The idea is to perform thirty reps of each exercise before moving to the next exercise.  You may need to do say 10 reps, rest 10-20 seconds, then do 8 reps, rest, do 6 reps, etc. until you finally reach thirty reps.

Steve also points out ways you can modify the exercises in case you are able to perform the full exercise.  For instance, if you cannot do a full pullup, then you could use a lower bar and rest your heels out away from the bar so you only pull up a portion of your weight.  Over time you can raise the bar incrementally until you are able to do all 30 pull ups from hanging position.  Likewise, pushups could be started on a raised bar so you are at an incline and only pushing a portion of your total weight.

The Spartan reference is not needed.  It plays off the popularity of the film ""300"" and the legendary toughness of the Spartan warriors. But it does emphasize the point that this will get you into super ""functional"" shape.

You could use this workout as a basis for designing your own weekly workouts, or as a periodic test of your overall conditioning.  There are no gimmicks and minimal equipment, and he carefully demonstrates and explains how to do each exercise as he is performing the entire 300 reps.",1200787200,24,1340,4.3453815261044175
2894869,4,B000T5P3VM,"I just got the DVD delivered and it was fast!! Ordered it one week, got it the following week, way before estimated delivery time.
Now, Ive read all the reviews about this product and Its looks like an effective routine to alternate with anyones weight training rouitne. If your envious of Brad Pitts Fight Club, like me, then this and your body sculpting weights will do the trick. FORGET ABOUT THE ACTUAL 300 WORKOUT THE ACTORS DID, this is good, plus, they did that routine as a one-off test, not as a regualr workout.

You can easily search the web for what they had to do to get prepared for the final 300 test and this is a very descent alternative, without weights, as it makes you use almost all the same motors as the actors had too.

He even does the workout himself as demo for 40 minutes and hes raw with it. Make the investment, forget the haters.",1192579200,18,860,4.36875
2894870,5,B000T5P3VM,"I think, before we write a review, we have to know for what audience the product is intended. The spartan workout 300 is definitely not for MMA fighters or anyone with high fitness level. Probably also tha name is incorrect marketing gimmick.
The workout itself, for a men with low fitness level, who want to improve his strength,stamina and flexibility(not the main focus) in home environment(without expensive equipment, mostly bodyweight) is one of the best. Common bodyweight exercises, not Pilates or Yoga if someone expect that.
 My friend asked me to make excercises program for him. I had not time to measure his strength level, calculate the weight for exercises, etc and gave him this DVD. Explanations are detailed,easy to understand, Maxwell even says how to breath(what is very important and unfortunately missing from many exercises DVDs) and you can combine exercises from different levels(begins-advanced) to make your own workout if some parts of your body is stronger. My friend is excited with the result/time what this workout gave him, and I think the same.
Conclusion: for the office worker, without time for personal trainer and going to gym, this is very good do it yourself workout. Also true, the price is higher than it should be, but workout realy make you better.",1190678400,31,1292,5.065727699530516
2894871,1,B000T5P3VM,"Ok I found this video when ordering a copy of the movie itself. I checked it out here because it is a blatant rip off. The trainers for the movie were Gym Jones founder, Mark Twight, and member Logan Hood. The Gym Jones site has the ""300"" workout on there site. Funny thing is the now famous workout isn't a work out or plan at all. It was a test they invited to participants to partake in. Links for the test itself and the so called program can be found here:

[...]

[...]

If you want a plan to follow the true 300 work out is not for you. If you want to be inspired by what can be achieved then go take a look at the links. Dont waste your money on this video if you want what the actors achieved go to the site. Do some research. Do some soul searching. Its not as easy as ordering a video where some hack rip off artist tells you what to do, but it will be more rewarding.",1189814400,9,879,3.9269662921348316
2894872,2,B000T5P3VM,"For those who are looking the original 300 workout that the stars of the movie used are on mens health website or just put 300 workout on google and the workout is there for free.  Now on to the review he does mention the spartans in the beginning section but what marketing I am sure he got his money out of everybody with this workout routine.  The reason I gave it two stars is because I finally found an alternative to the hindu push up when I get tired of doing them the regular way.  Steve maxwell clearly tricked everyone his kettlebell dvd's were fairly good and then this dvd comes out shame on you.  I wish I had seen some reviews of this overpriced dvd before I bought it my mother watched it as I have some of my packages go to their house and she even said that this man was full of it.  Bad dvd buy mark delisle, semperfit, or the pit workout much better.",1188086400,8,869,4.148809523809524
2894873,1,B000T5P3VM,"For some strange reason people believe that it is okay to TRICK people into buying their products. Usually I am more of a discerning shopper, I actually read the reviews before I purchase any item that costs 40.00. However, I was so caught up in the excitement of 300 that I didn't do my research and find the real one for free online. (men's health) I am pissed, this is NOT THAT WORKOUT, if you are looking for something  that you may have not done before and are not sure about the results,  and/or you have some time to waste or are not already serious about your workout by all means purchasse this dvd.",1188000000,12,608,4.324561403508772
2894874,4,B000T5P3VM,"This is a great DVD, Steve Maxwell explains it better than you can imagine and from different angles, it is just overall great, its not worth 40 dollars but i split it with 3 of my friends so its ok.",1187049600,11,199,4.0
2894875,4,B000T5P3VM,"This type of training has really taken the fitness world by storm and is highly effective for men as it raises the testosterone levels. This is the same style of training that was used to get the actors in 300 is such great shape. It is important however to do the right type of exercises in the right sequence or you will not be able to sustain the correct level of intensity for maximum effect. Maxwell in fact does a great job on this DVD teaching this same style of Spartan training because he really knows this type of training and is a highly regarded strength coach. I have some of his Kettlebell DVDs and the guy is very knowledgeable and in amazing shape. Steve breaks the training down into three levels with superset exercises. He takes a very kinetic approach and I have seen some awesome results using this workout. In only about 3 weeks, I have jumped from being able to perform 7 pull ups in a row to 15. That's double! My endurance has also jumped quite nicely. I am still working on the first level and will not most likely not see level 3 for quite some time. If you can get past the whole Spartan thing, you will really like the workout. I am waiting for a more in depth DVD at this type of training to come out after the 300 movie dies down.",1186617600,6,1261,4.258333333333334
2894876,2,B000T5P3VM,"Normally, I'm a bit more frugal with my money, but I had been looking for a DVD showing the workout the actors in '300' were put through to get them in shape for the movie, and for obvious reasons, I thought this was it.

This is NOT the workout used to prep for the movie!!!  It's just packaged as the ""300 Spartan workout"" as a marketing gimmick, and gets away with it by basing the workout aroung 300 reps, and gives a brief, irrelevant little reminder of who the Spartans were in the introduction.

The workout is effective, but not any more effective than anything I could have (and actually have) come up with on my own. Definitely not worth the $40 they're asking for it.",1186444800,39,678,4.365079365079365
8207890,5,B000T5P3VM,"Very satisfied!! It is the workout I have looking for a lot ot time. You do not need anything, only your body, to workout the five pillas of Steve Maxwell.",1465084800,,155,4.2
8207891,5,B000T5P3VM,Great body weight work out!!,1461196800,,28,4.8

8207893,5,B000T5P3VM,"My exercise library includes P90X, P90X2, and The Spartan 300 workout. P90X and P90X2 offer excellent and highly polished workout packages with lots of different workouts. But my favorite total body workout is The Spartan 300 Workout. This DVD doesn't have a professional look like the P90X DVDs, that's not too important. This old guy, Steve Maxwell, is incredible. He stands in front of a curtain with his pullup bar, and he just gets to work. And I do my best to follow him during this 36 minute intense workout. My t-shirt is always soaked in sweat by the end. The routine is carefully planned. There are 10 exercises that are grouped in 5 pairs. The routine works your cardio, flexibility, and strength. It's a fantastic total body workout.

I still can't 'keep up with the old man', but I do my best! I highly recommend it.",1381968000,,829,4.639455782312925
8207894,5,B000T5P3VM,"Steve Maxwell impresses with his simple instruction yet difficult exercises. Listen to his instruction and perform the exercises to your best ability and you will be improved. Mr Maxwell provides an interesting array of bodyweight exercises that are challenging physically and mentally. After 4 weeks of training twice a week I have noticed considerable reduction in my shoulder pain and knee pain. I have dropped from 24% to 22% BF. If you want to get your body under control then this work out is a very good tool to use. This is a no fluff work out; it is you, your body and mind. No gimmicks, no pep talk, just work. Your improvement is up to you.",1265587200,6,651,4.572649572649572
8207895,2,B000T5P3VM,"I just wanted to let everyone know that this is NOT the spartan workout.  I, too, was fooled by the title and description and was furious when I received it and found out it's just a low budget home video.  I will say that although it was not what I thought I ordered, I gave it a shot and it is a good workout but one that I would have paid $25 for at Target not $60!",1232582400,3,368,3.7662337662337664
8207896,5,B000T5P3VM,"Ignore the other people bashing this DVD. There is no such thing as the ""300 Workout."" If you want to work out like the guys from 300, go to gymjones.com and check out their daily workouts posted on their schedule. NOW, once your realize that you can't even do half the stuff they are doing buy this DVD.
You see, most of the ""actors"" from 300 were stuntmen, who were already in decent shape when they started training. The workouts they did just took their athleticism to an extreme level. It is not intended for the average joe.
This DVD is intended for people whose athleticism is inferior to the 300 guys (which is the vast majority of you whether you want to admit it or not). What makes this dvd so valuable is the fact that you can trust Maxwell. If you've seen him, you would know that he's 55 and is ripped like a 300 actor. He is a very knowledgeable man, and not only that but he also visits Gym Jones regularly and trains them in kettlebell exercises. Check out this: [...]
The hardest thing in the fitness world today is finding an instructor whom you can trust has the proper knowledge. Steve is one of those guys.",1231545600,15,1128,4.350710900473934
8207897,5,B000T5P3VM,"I was led to this workout DVD after reading ""The History of Western Philosophy"" by Bertrand Russell.  There is a chapter on Sparta in Russell's book, and subsequently, I became very interested in the Spartans and their physical conditioning.  I didn't buy this DVD because of the movie ""300"" (I think it's one of the worst movies of all time!), I bought it because I want an intense workout with minimal equipment like the way warriors and athletes probably would have trained in Ancient Greece.

All this DVD will do for you is make you stronger, more agile, improve your coordination, and over time, give you a good looking body.  Ignore the reviews by the 300 fan boys.  The marketing guys should have left the part about the movie body out.  Other than that, the workout program itself is good.",1224115200,5,798,4.664285714285715
8207898,5,B000T5P3VM,This is a great concept and challenged presented in a way that is easily understood.  All of the exercises are excellently demonstrated and a plan for attaining the final goal is presented.,1211328000,5,189,4.90625
8207899,4,B000T5P3VM,"This product would rate 5 stars if the 'basic' and 'intermediate' workouts had been follow-along. The title gimic not withstanding, I modified the workout a bit, adding a leg exercise with every cycle, so there is always a push-leg-pull or abdominal-leg-upper body cycle of 3 sets, and I followed Steve's timing, 3 sets of 8, and 4 cycles of exercises:

1. pivot pushups, single leg squats (on box), pull ups, 8 reps each
2. dips, rocking chair (stand up from back roll w 1 legged squat), leglifts
3. row on rings, deck squats (or sumo squat), 'hindu' pushups
4. leglifts to elbows, slow lunges, crocodile (one handed) pushups or other pushup.

This took more than 30 mins, taking only a break in between to drink water as in the dvd, and I could not finish the last cycle! Now that I have done this workout several times, I can see a difference. My clothes fit tighter, my muscles have become denser, etc. If I can stop feeling sore after every workout, I might do it 2/week. Like the other reviewer, do not listen to the negativity, this dvd is very good; thanks Steve!!!",1206835200,13,1073,4.55440414507772
