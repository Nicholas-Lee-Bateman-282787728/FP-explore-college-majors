8183620,3,B000O78C4U,The instruction is good but unfortunatley they aint the Bob Dylan versions and they just sound a bit like Dylan. So if you want to sound a bit like Bob Dylan fine. otherwise try elsewhere.,1411430400,,188,4.4
8183621,3,B000O78C4U,"Lots of great reviews for this DVD so I thought it was a sure thing.  But  Traum teaches his own interpretation of some of the songs.  I haven't watched them all because I wanted to learn how Bob Dylan played them.  The first thing Happy Traum says in at least two of the teaching videos is that he is not doing it the way Dylan played the song.  These are his own fingerpicking interpretations in both rhythm and patterns. So if you want learn how Bob played them this is not the DVD to teach you.  If you just want to learn some fun variations from his playing style this is fine.  Although he tells you he never plays these things the same way twice, like most good folk musicians.  I picked up some ideas and you get the chords, tab, and notation which is great to have. I'll keep it as a reference CD but probably won't work through all of it.

by the way, it was Buckets of Rain I most wanted to learn.  Traum does a very bluesy version instead of the original.  A good interpretation for a very different style.",1372636800,4,1018,4.195876288659794
8183622,5,B000O78C4U,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This DVD features Happy Traum's excellent instruction from the unique perspective of someone who was there. Happy's group, the New world Singers, was actually the first to record some of Dylan's early classics. I also bought the DVD's ""Learn to Play the Songs of Bob Dylan"" taught by Nate Lapointe and Fred Sokolow's ""The Music of Bob Dylan."" Nate LaPointe's video is great for learning the songs as played on the original recordings. The Happy Traum video is great for learning to create and improvise your own version within the style of the original. The Sokolow video teaches his own arrangements which are also very good and I learned a few things from it as well. I think Happy Traum was the best teacher of the three, and the most fun, but all 3 videos offered something valid. In the folk tradition, arrangements and even lyrics and chords are often changed as songs morph into different versions. Bob Dylan's songs themselves often began in another form. Happy's video is the best for helping you understand the original style, but helping you find your own creative way to present it.",1364342400,3,1130,4.8
8183623,5,B000O78C4U,"The title pretty much sums it up for me:  Happy Traum is my favorite guitar instructor; and teaching the songs of my favorite artist, Bob Dylan, is the perfect match for me.

Happy Traum is a gifted teacher.  It is already a given that he is a gifted musician.  I first learned of him when listening to the cuts he did with Dylan for the Greatest Hits II album where he backed Dylan with guitar and banjo.  More recently, I have been purchasing just about everything Homespun (Traum's family business of music instruction on DVD) puts out.  His fingerpicking, Christmas, and general instruction DVDs are wonderful.  His catalog of DVDs are carefully put out in Levels, with some geared towards Level 1 (no experience necessary) and others having multiple DVDs going from Level 1 to Level 3 (intermediate player).

Happy is a Dylan fan and his enthusiasm comes across when teaching.  He is like a kind gentleman who comes into your home to teach you.  He has the abiliity to simplify material down to understandable breaks, and with the judicious use of the pause button, you really can get MONTHS of guitar lessons in a single DVD.  His Homespun video productions (now DVDs) feature some of the best musicians alive today.  The camera work is clear, focused, with excellent dual cameras so you can see close ups of the left hand and the right hand.

It is about as close as one can get to hiring one of our country's best musicians into your home for private lessons.  To me, these are more valuable than anything I can get locally, in spite of having some good musicians offering lessons here.  Here you have the opportunity to ""hire"" someone good enough to play with Dylan for an incredible bargain.  Some of Happy's DVDs will take me months to finish.

My only complaint?  I wish he had more songs for us...hopefully, in the future, he will!",1175558400,21,1844,4.638888888888889
