3064494,5,B0011EIO8O,"I love this workout! Everyday I look forward to doing it. It's a great mix of yoga and pilates. It works every part of the body especially your legs and abdominals and it makes you sweat. If some of the exercises are too hard, there's another girl there that you can follow instead. It's really simple to follow, and after you're done it feels great. I feel like I have more energy after doing this workout, I love it.",1260748800,4,418,4.30379746835443
3064495,5,B0011EIO8O,This DVD was very good. The instructions were given very clearly by Kathy. The camera shots were perfect so one can watch Kathy and her partner as they do the moves. Her partner gives you the easier version of the moves. I have recommended this DVD to all my fellow students in my Yoga-Pilates class. If you want to do your exercises at home and have something that is easy to follow then this is the DVD for you. I am not an advanced Yoga-Pilates person so I was grateful for the verbal instrucions that Kathy gives throughout the whole program. But I believe that a more advanced person would love the flow of the exercises that are presented here.,1260230400,5,650,4.425
3064496,5,B0011EIO8O,"First of all, don't be misled by the headstands on the back cover---there are no headstands in this workout!  (I almost didn't buy it because of that, due to neck injury issues)

This is a terrific workout.  It is surprisingly difficult to find a yoga pilates blend that actually integrates the two in a quick paced yet thoughtful way.  If that is what you're looking for, this is it.  It combines the breathing and body consciousness and spirit-consciousness of yoga with the core strength focus of pilates, AND the aerobic exercise of repetitions in some of the poses.  You will sweat!!!

The workout is one full hour long.  It starts fast and strong with ""power pilates"", them goes into lengthy vinyasa flow sun salutation series , and then goes back into pilates floor work.  however, there is pilates in the yoga and yoga in the pilates as well.  due to my neck and shoulder issues i fast forward through a part of the vinyasa sun salutation  section, but still have 50 minutes of hard workout to do.

What I love most is that she is really committed to the idea of modifications.  While all reputable teachers mention modifications and many dvds will include them, she seems more focused than most on making sure that you really feel good about doing them, like you are honoring your own body's needs.

Her personal story that she shares at the end is inspiring.  This is a person who has faced a major health crisis and overcome it through mind-body work.  So, when she talks about the breath and the body, you can really believe her.",1253750400,12,1541,4.610294117647059

3064498,4,B0011EIO8O,"I used to take a ""yogalates"" class at the gym but I moved and there isn't a class like that at the gym here.  So I was looking for something that was similar to the class I enjoyed and Kathy Ackerman's ""Yoga-Pilates Fusion"" DVD is just what I was looking for.

I find the moves flow together very well and the transitions are smooth.  I also like that there are modifications for everything, and many things have several levels of challenge.  I've worked out with the DVD about 14 times now and I can definitely notice an improvemnt in my ability to do the exercise, including moving up to the more challenging moves for some things.  I have definition in my arms, abs, and legs again, and my back feels stronger.

If you are a true beginner with no knowledge of yoga poses, you may need to watch through it once or twice to figure out what a ""down dog"" and a ""warrior one"" are.  She does a good job in some aspects of explaining which muscle(s) you should feel working.  There is one move (hands off the mat to the side, kneeling on one knee, leg out to the side pulsing up and down) and I'm not exactly sure where I'm supposed to feel the effort so I'm not sure I'm doing it just right.

All in all I'm very pleased with the DVD and look forwards to other productions from Kathy Ackerman!",1215820800,20,1290,4.254098360655738

8241545,5,B0011EIO8O,"I'm new to the yoga scene (4 months) and recently purchased this dvd. I received a challenging workout and appreciated the simple to follow modifications. I am happy to have finally found a good workout to add to my collection. The workout runs 62 minutes...but worth it!

The only thing that was a little low budget was the recording...a few times you could see off the set with excess background stuff but overall the content was worth the purchase. Additionally, I appreciated Kathy's personal story...keeps me motivated.

Go for it...buy it!",1281484800,5,545,4.978021978021978
8241546,3,B0011EIO8O,"I have done Pilates on and off for years, but am new to yoga. I found the DVD to be a good overall workout, but I get bored about midway through and have yet been able to finish it. I stopped and watched the rest of the video, and it really is a great workout, but I get bored with the music and a lot of the yoga poses are very repititious. About midway through, Kathy starts doing some Pilates and some more advanced moves. I think if I started it in the middle and went from there, I would enjoy it more. On a better note, all of the moves flow very well together and Kathy does well at instructing you what to do next. The girl with her does the modifications and its very easy to see her throughout the video.",1272412800,7,714,4.0
