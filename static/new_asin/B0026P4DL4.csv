3855603,1,B0026P4DL4,"The reviewer of this ""Old propaganda documentary"" is much to generous awarding three stars.
Simply put.  One star is much too generous!  Not only should this a zero star be offered free - Amazon should offer to pay us to watch it!",1330128000,2,230,4.4523809523809526
3855604,3,B0026P4DL4,"I have an almost 3-year-old train lover and this was cheap so I thought I would buy it.  It is not just old footage (which is in serious need of a digital remaster) but is an old documentary with a narrator describing stuff the whole time.
They show a lot of behind the scenes stuff, not just trains, so my little guy lost interest.
An older child train lover might find it interesting.  Keep in mind, it really does sound like propaganda for the railroad industry.  It is also very sexist as reflected during its day.  I can't count how many times they said MAN and MEN.  As in, ""It's not an easy way to make a living, but a railroad MAN can take it.""  Ok that wouldn't bother me so much if every other sentence didn't sound like that.  The only women are in the office.  So if you have a railroad loving girl, she might find this interesting as a piece of history, but you will have to talk to her about how women CAN do these jobs also if they want and this is from a long time ago.  You might even say a little something to your boys.
I actually found some of the information interesting and since it is presented in a simplistic propaganda tone, I actually think it would make it more accessible to a young audience (4-7).
Since it is so cheap, it might be an excellent buy and a nice look back into railroad history.  If you are highly sensitive to sexism, it isn't for you.  If you have a very young train lover (2-3) you might wait a year or two.",1324598400,2,1454,4.1571428571428575

8353326,4,B0026P4DL4,"This is a good DVD for those who want to see archival
footage of long-ago railroads.  Features lots of steam
and early diesel locomotives.

There are several promos from defunct railroads included.
It's kinda of amusing to listen to their interpretation
of ""modern technology"" from the 1940's and 50's.",1337990400,,302,5.142857142857143
