7964036,5,B0000687MW,"Good education and entertainment for kids and adults.
Excellent video for a child who likes vehicles, even at two they'll be totally engaged. Great explanations of how they work and what they do, including really fascinating cleaning methods. Interviews are properly geared to the age group. Dave is a bit goofy but tolerable for adults. Good as an interest booster for kids who are hesitant to take their first ride, includes good safety tips.
Buses include the following: school, city, Greyhound, cross-country bus, expensive tour, London double-decker, articulated, trolley, and floating.",1218412800,,591,5.5054945054945055
7964037,5,B0000687MW,"This is a typical instalment in the ""There Goes A .... "" video series for the preschool set. We see a wide variety of buses, get a good explanation of how they work and what they do, talk to a few people who work in the field, get a safety tip or two, and watch Dave in various goofy predicaments which, in this video, aren't as questionable as they have been in some others. Unfortunately Becky is not here, but we get to see city buses, a Greyhound cross-country bus, a decked-out tour bus, a double-decker London bus, an articulated bus, a trolley and a bus boat, as well as cleaning and maintenance facilities; also, a lot of time is spent looking at a school bus and its safety features.  All in all, a good addition to the series and an entertaining tape for kids and their adults.",1036540800,7,787,4.3175675675675675
