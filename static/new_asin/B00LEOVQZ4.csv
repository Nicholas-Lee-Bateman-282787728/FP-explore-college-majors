8665422,5,B00LEOVQZ4,"Every teen boy should watch this DVD ""The Sex Talk Every Teen Guy Needs to Hear"" - many times if necessary.  Jackie Brewton is one of our country's top, nationally respected sex-ed experts and youth motivational speakers, and this video is chock-full of guy-centric facts and information to provide the necessary motivation to teen boys to refuse sex, for their own good as well as that of their female partners.  By asking compelling, and thought-provoking questions, and by presenting numerous testimonies of other boys who have attended her seminars, Jackie keeps the information highly interesting and relevant to teen boys, appealing to their sense of self-worth and to the worth of their female friends, to provide the ""want-to"" to avoid sex before marriage, and to protect the honor, emotions and health of the girls in their lives.  This video can and will expand the concept of your teen boys as to what it really means to be a man, and the importance to his future wife in terms of health risks and emotional turmoil of remaining sexually pure until marriage.  I use this video with small groups of boys in our local juvenile detention center, but also highly recommend it to all parents as a premier tool for use with their sons in providing them with the information and moral thinking necessary to avoid the pitfalls and life-long consequences of failing to master their hormones during their preteen, teen and college years, where one mistake could alter the course of their life in tremendously negative ways.  Definitely a five-star rating for this ""must-have"" resource.",1469059200,,1586,4.992424242424242
8665423,5,B00LEOVQZ4,"Jackie Brewton's ""The Sex Talk Every Teen Girl Needs to Hear"" is hands down the best resource I've found for initiating a meaningful discussion with your teen girls about the dangers and potentially life-long consequences teen girls are accepting when they choose to have sex prior to marriage, and the life-long benefits of abstinence until that time.  Jackie provides teen girls with a wealth of information about their self-worth and about the emotional and physical risks and consequences of having premarital sex, in ways that appeal to teen age girls and that they can readily understand and accept.  I use this resource in our local juvenile detention center with small group ministries to girls, because Jackie both builds up the girls self-esteem and sense of self-worth, while empowering them with the knowledge and techniques to resist temptation and peer pressure, including self-talk, to have sex, without any condemnation whatsoever.  Her talks are interesting to teens, fact-based, empowering and inspiring - they give teen girls the ""want-to"" to delay sex until marriage.  This resource is totally appropriate for preteen and teen-age girls, and I highly recommend it to all parents who want to prepare their girls for the temptations they will face in school and society, to safeguard their futures for the most free and productive adult lives they can possibly have.",1469059200,,1384,5.248868778280543
8665424,5,B00LEOVQZ4,"I recommend this DVD for anyone who has a teenage daughter whether she is showing an interest in boys or not. The video encourages conversation between mother and daughter, allows for self-examination, and reiterates for girls, their value and how they are really in control. I watched this with my teen twice and I think she gets it more than I could have ever explained it. I am circulating this DVD amongst all her friends whose parents approve and am getting ready to order the DVD for the boys even though I don't have a son.

Thanks a Million Jackie!!",1423612800,,557,4.57
8665425,5,B00LEOVQZ4,"I love how frank she is about the consequences of making decisions regarding EVERYTHING. She does not down having sex. She openly talks how powerful it can be, but she does drive into you that something so powerful has consequences.

This is NOT a safe sex talk. This is a talk about consequences of your actions.

I highly recommend this talk. If you wish to go deeper between you and your teen, then certainly do so, but it is vital they understand the consequences. Not just the 'safest' way to try and avoid them.",1415145600,,517,4.48936170212766
8665426,5,B00LEOVQZ4,"Outstanding!  This video is packed with lots of useful information.  I loved the fast pace but had to listen intently so I wouldn't miss a word.  There are plenty of places to pause the DVD to kick-off the discussions, then resume.  I found this information helpful for all ages not just High School teens.  My goddaughter is 19 and a Sophomore in college.  She loved it so much that she is having her own ""Girls' Night Out"" to play it for her friends so they can begin the much needed dialogue.",1406419200,,495,4.384615384615385
8665427,5,B00LEOVQZ4,"To sum up this message in one word : POWERFUL

Jackie Brewton gives an abstinence talk that is appropriate for any setting; school, church, sleepovers, etc. All parents and youth leaders need to invest in this DVD. Instead of telling teens to say NO to sex, she instead encourages them to say YES to their dreams. There are so many quotes, powerful points and anecdotes in the message that it will resonate and have an impact on ALL who hear it. I agree, many adults don't have high standards for today's generation.  This is a comprehensive message that examines and gets people to think about ALL the effects of teenage sex and poor decision making--not just teen pregnancy and STD's that are constantly pushed in today's sex education and awareness campaigns.  If you are concerned about the youth and have any in your care- you will not regret purchasing this DVD.",1405814400,,868,4.735099337748345
