8657331,5,B00KBERO2C,"I first saw footage from CiE, right after director, Teal Greyhavens, returned from a year of globetrotting and study of world cinema.  I knew then already that he was sitting on a great story. That Mark Cousins, Tilda Swinton et al. lend their voices to this global ""love-letter"" to cinema is a real vote of confidence in this fine young film-maker!  A must-see for any devoted cinephile.",1400284800,,388,4.776119402985074
