7956646,3,B00005Y6XF,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this Ova series, but it turned out to be a decent show. I will admit that the constant showing of the robots combining every episode was not needed, but that's what fast forwarding is for. The show starts off with a strong intro, and then has a pretty decent storyline; 3 girls who can save the earth from Alien invaders due to their DNA. The show only has 6 episodes, yet at the end hinted on their being a follow up series; which I wish had existed. Unless it is under a different title, I don't think a continuation was ever made. This show is mainly for mecha fans, especially if you like it a bit on the corney side; a lot of the attacks reminded me of Power Ranger moves. Although one thing that did remain consistant, was that the look of the enemy, and their growth was pretty impressive. An unfinished series, yet enjoyable nontheless.",1301097600,,878,4.359756097560975
7956647,3,B00005Y6XF,"When I first read about ""Z-MIND"", I thought it was pretty cool to hear an anime OAV series that paid somewhat of a homeage to classic mecha and shojo series.

The 1998 OAV series was the first OAV ""moe"" series by SUNRISE. Moe which is a Japanese slang for a fetish or love for characters in video games, anime or manga.

And the series is created by Yatate Hajime.  Basically involved with the majority of the Gundam anime and manga with ""original concept"" but known by many for creating major anime titles such as ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""The Big O"", ""Witch Hunter Robin"" and ""The Vision of Escaflowne"".  Definitely a big name attached to this series.

The screenplay is by Fuyunori Gobu, known for his work wtih ""Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory"", ""Armored Trooper Votoms"", ""Choudenji Machine Voltes V"" and other mecha series.

And with Yatate's vision of creating something different from his previous major mecha anime series, ""Z-MIND"" definitely shows its difference from current mecha anime series as the main characters are a family of young girls.

The main story of ""Z-MIND"" is about your average family in Tokyo. A hardworking husband and his wife who take care of their four daughters and a son.

Everything seems to be going fine until eldest daughter, Ayame is kidnapped and next thing you know, she is piloting a large mecha robot known as the Z-MIND and taking on these monsters.

With the Earth being threatened again by the monsters, employees led by the government and Jim Pekinpah tries to enlist Ayame and her sisters to pilot the Z-MIND and its robot parts because it only will respond to their family DNA.

What is the secret behind Ayame and her family? And why is that their DNA can only interact with the Z-MIND? And who is this guy in a red trenchcoat that happens to show up when Ayame is in trouble? And who is the pink fire lady that shows up when the Z-MIND is in trouble?

All in all, ""Z-MIND"" is a fun anime series and it pays homage (or parodies) classic anime series. The first half of the series plays out like a family anime series with parents trying to protect their kids and of course, not get along with their kids.

The character designs feels a bit retro and with the daughters spouting language like ""groovy"" and ""far-out"", definitely a homage to series from the 70's. And of course, when the girls get into their ""Z-MIND"" clothing, definitely a shojo homage to series like ""Sailor Moon"" with the semi-nude to clothing transformations.

But I really enjoyed the humor of the show and how the family interacted well with each other in the first four episodes but the final two episodes becomes somewhat more serious and focuses more on the mecha battles and the challenges of facing more difficult enemies.

VIDEO:

The OAV series was released in 1998 and released in the US on DVD in 2001.  But for those mainly exposed to digitally animated OAV's, of course, this anime may seem a bit old school.  But I guess with the storyline taking place in the 70's, the age kind of helps it.  All in all, nothing bad.  It's a colorful anime and I didn't really see anything that stood out video-wise.

AUDIO:

I watched both in Japanese and English.  Both are regular 2.0 Dolby Digital and both are acted very well.  I will have to say one thing that urks me about the English dub and that is the character of Koji.  Why they gave him a foreigner English accent for the English Dub, I have no idea.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Special features are primarily the textless opening, cover art gallery (which I'm guessing is the art for the VHS or LD release, total of six cover art) and the trailers.  The back of the cover says there is a textless ending but it seems that was dropped or forgotten in the final print of the DVD.  There is also a reversible cover.

All in all, this was an entertaining anime series.  For me, coming into it so late, I was very curious to see how the anime paid homage to 70's mecha series and all in all, it was fun.

I really liked the dysfunctional family dynamic with the whole family always fighting and then helping each other out.  Definitely some comic relief there.

I didn't get into the mecha battles all that much because the series focused so much on the characters in the first half, I guess I wanted to see more of that in the second half but there was a quick switch from character development to all out mecha battle.  And I can understand why, especially the pacing of the first episodes of learning about the characters and then having them battle the evil monsters to end the storyline.

If anything, I'm glad the creators added an epilogue right after the credits, to give the series some closure.  But in a way, I wished there was more of ""Z-MIND"" but all in all, it was a very fun series and with a total of all six-episodes, for its price these days, it's a steal.

All in all, a groovy anime series that definitely is unique for paying homage to mecha/shojo classics and for it's price, an entertaining series worth owning.",1218153600,,5003,4.543526785714286
7956648,2,B00005Y6XF,"They said it couldn't happen but they were wrong...yet anouther offering from the genre which of late can do little else but fall into the category of 'done to death'. Yes, once more we wander into the world of quint retro shojo Mech. Excuse me if I don't wave my hands in the air and scream girlishly. While I'm sure there are those who'll enjoy this little foray into the life of the average Japanese teenage girl who happens to be in possesion of monolithic mechs, I'm sure most will recognise it for what it truly is. I'm afraid that, in a market where the name 'Gundam' is the be all and end all of what we class as 'classic' full-on Mech, Bubblegum's numerous spawnings monopolise the shojo Mech market and Votoms and the like are the last word in retro cheese, Z-mind is a little out of it's depth.",1018137600,,805,4.373333333333333
7956649,4,B00005Y6XF,"Sunrise, The studio that is making it's presence known in america these last few years with it's classic Mobile Suit Gundam francise has created yet another piece of creativity. Z-mind tells the story of four Japanese sisters(three teenaged girls and a little girl)that happen to live in the city of Tokyo in the 1970's who have by accident discover a giant robot that was created by their deceased father to fight a mysterious alien force invading the city. The teenaged girls use the giant robot to stop that alien force. Yes the name is one of the unusual names anyone can come up with but don't let the name fool you. The mecha designs are very unique and special and the animation is pretty standard anime fare especially for a OVA(original video animation). If you just reading this and want to know the plot, well i can't tell you that if you have never seen it before but all i can tell you is that the episodes are episodic and don't follow a particular storyline just like a regular TV anime show. So give this title a shot and and it may not be your cup of tea as far as the concept but it's pretty fun to watch if you're into both Shojo(girls anime and manga)and Mecha.",1016582400,3,1181,4.422018348623853
