6980166,4,B00SEAAZ7G,"I had heard of this documentary before but I had always been a little turned off by it because I thought I was just going to be preached at about how bad meat is for the environment without a lot of backing. I also thought the conspiracy part was going to be blown out of proportion for the sake of entertainment. I was not surprised when the documentary started off with an extremely high level fear appeal discussing the possibility of seemingly imminent disastrous floods, droughts, climate wars, and eventual extinction. I was then also not surprised to be bombarded with statistic after statistic regarding how intrusive the animal agriculture has become to the environment. However a few of them did catch my attention. I was interested in how the narrator and creator of the documentary, Kip, was going to back up all of these claims. I was especially interested in why none of the leading environmental protection agencies did not have any of these reports as a part of their comprehensive research on any of their public discourse pages.
 From what was shown on the documentary Kip and his team did an extensive job of researching this topic before going out and accusing the large environmental non-profits of being corrupt which in my opinion was a necessary element to be persuasive. I think that in terms of reliability, Kip did a service bringing this issue into the public sphere when not many others would on such a grand scale. He confronted issues and brought out facts that have been living in the technical sphere for some time now, at a time that is going to be integral to preserving our world. Watching many executives from environmental activist groups deny, avoid and decline to comment on the tough questions that he presented was a pretty eye opening experience and shined light on the fact that there is very possibly a real corruption that exists in this issue. This is assuming that none of these interviews were taken out of context, but his production team makes a consistent effort to present this information very clearly.
 The way that some of the interviews were framed also stood out to me. It seemed that when interviewing the sustainable farm ranchers, an environmental framework was being extracted from them on purpose. It felt to me that he knew they were going to say, We don't feel that livestock has a carbon footprint. While I understand this quote is one that helps him prove his point, it felt that he was looking for this response. This was not a constant theme that I felt throughout the documentary though. I thought one of the most moving parts of the documentary was when a representative and even the CEO of the Animal Agriculture Alliance gave an extremely suspicious reaction and declined to comment when asked if they donated to environmental protection groups, specifically GreenPeace. The CEO even said she would not know who they donate to which is pretty unbelievable.
 The documentary comes full circle in the end and destabilizes the initial fear appeal at the start of the documentary. They present a very tangible way that any person can drastically help the environmental crisis we are facing as a result of animal agriculture. They present a few different lifestyle changes you can make in regards to diet and explicitly explain approximate positive results that can result of these changes making it much more realistic for people to believe they can make a difference. Overall, as a skeptic coming into watching this, I would recommend it to other skeptics. Maybe it will convince you to make a lifestyle change, maybe it wont, but regardless it will help you become more informed about a large issue that is being swept under the rug by big business and government.",1521072000,,3735,4.8328125

6980168,4,B00SEAAZ7G,"About a guy that sees Al Gore's first film and is convicted by the waste he feels he is partaking is changes the ways he lives his life. Then he becomes aware that according to statistics that the raising of animals for eating causes more CO2/pollution than ALL of transportation combined!

Horrified and mortified that this data is not easily available he contacts many organizations claiming to put forth the 'Save the Planet' agenda. They are ALL COMPLETELY uninterested in his data. He is horrified again. He seeks out authors that write on the subject and he is told that the big operations that promote the positions that fossil fuel is evil do not want to make the message too complicated for sheeple.

He contacts farmers raising live stock and lets them share their positions, insightful. He even visits a man who processes an animal in front of him which is VERY difficult to watch (I turned away). So he takes a unproductive chicken to an animal preserve.

Insightful and interesting, some scenes are too hard to watch. Unfortunately that is a story that is not being told. Notice the lack of reviews. Hmmm. Would love to hear Al Gore's position on this!

6980174,4,B00SEAAZ7G,"Greenhouse gases, climate change, overpopulation, and sustainability- these are topics rife with controversy and everyone seems to have their own individual opinion on these issues and their severity. Cowspiracy attempts to answer some of the common questions regarding climate change, its causes, and its ultimate impact, often with surprising conclusions.

The usual suspect that causes climate change and environmental distress is, of course, vehicle emissions/pollution. But this documentary is out to show that the main cause of this problem is, in fact, something you wouldnt suspect. Its actually the raising of livestock and, as the film demonstrates, there is much ignorance about this fact. Even those who know refuse to fully acknowledge the problem often for various political and economic reasons.

One thing I like about this documentary compared to many others in this genre is that it tends to stick to the facts. It talks about the population explosion over the past century, the acidification of the oceans, the amount of waste brought on by having so many farm animals to raise and feed, the excessive amount of water needed to raise animals for slaughter, and so on. This is good because these facts are going to be difficult for anyone to dispute. There were a few moments where the facts presented were slightly misleading, but other than that, what this documentary presents is spot- on.

Another thing I like about this film is the interviews. The host of documentary talks openly with different members of environmental activist organizations and is often left with more questions unanswered than answered. The interviews are quite telling, as many of these individuals cannot even answer basic questions. Even though the host maintains his cool, you can sense his growing frustration. How can it be that people who operate organizations dedicated to protecting the environment know so little about the causes of environmental distress?

Cowspiracy helps viewers understand through visual graphics and this is another one of the films strong points. There are some disturbing scenes, too, so be prepared. Most deserving of mention is a scene with a live duck getting chopped in two as a farmer preps it for human consumption. This is a rather gruesome sight and it was intended that way. It is to make you, the viewer, feel repulsed by such actions to the point that you might consider changing your diet.

And that brings us to the bottom line of Cowspiracy: The beginning of a grass- roots effort to change the way people eat. I like that the documentary doesnt take things to extremes by suggesting that the government should ban meat or anything like that. No, the message seems to be that you and I are the first defense against these farming atrocities and we can begin by changing to a plant- based diet immediately. Once enough people make this change, the proliferation of livestock will slowly diminish and the earth will be a better place for us all.

Our planet earth is under continuous assault. The growing population and the difficulties in feeding so many people are making sustainability next to impossible. Agribusiness is one of the chief culprits. Cowspiracy is a useful documentary that brings these issues to light and while I may not be ready to adopt a vegan lifestyle just yet, this film certainly has given me food for thought.",1504224000,2,3378,5.044802867383512

6980189,5,B00SEAAZ7G,"This very well-made & astonishing movie is about the MAIN cause of Climate Change, a vast worldwide industry that dwarfs the oil and chemical industries yet has been largely ignored by mainstream media and environmental organizations.

It not only conclusively demonstrates that Climate Change is really happening, but provides tons of information on what we can do about it. It's a fascinating, well-researched and credible film that will even convince die-hard climate deniers to at least LOOK at the massive amount of undeniable evidence.

The only criticism I have of this film is that it blames several environmental organizations for not doing enough to tackle this powerful industry. But they are limited by the resources they have. The real problem is not environmentalists, but the vast worldwide animal agriculture industry that is so powerful it can buy politicians to subsidize these huge factory farms with the hard-earned tax dollars of Americans who pay through the nose for food that actually makes them sick.

I quit eating meat 20 years ago & I not only lost weight, but I have way more energy, fewer health problems and save a lot of money, too. I get more than enough protein from an organic vegan diet to regularly work out, lift weights and swim and I don't miss meat or cow dairy at all. The many delicious alternatives to animal protein today provide higher quality protein than meat with a far lower risk of cancer and require a tiny fraction of precious natural resources to do it. (A good example of this is Coconut Bliss, an alternative to ice cream, which actually tastes BETTER than ice cream!)

Highly recommended, especially to young people concerned about their future.",1485302400,,1702,4.982394366197183

6980191,3,B00SEAAZ7G,"Farming, it has been going on for centuries. In the beginning farming was a way for people to get away from the nomadic lifestyle. Today, it is a way to make money. In the past, animals were respected. Today, they are there for humans to have meat to eat. This need for meat and for money has affected not only humans but our environment we live in.
 In 2014, Cowspiracy, was distributed by A.U.M. Films and First Spark Media. Directed and produced by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn. This documentary is 91 minutes long. Kip Andersen goes to various people and environmental groups to try and find out the impact that animal agriculture has on the environment.
 Andersen goes across the country, interviewing environmental organization that are failing to address animal agriculture. While some declined an interview, some did agree. He discusses the impact on the rainforest, the oceans and the impact on our homes. When fishermen take fish from the ocean, they take other animals with them. For example, dolphins, whales and sharks. This animals are being taken when they don't have to be. The rainforest is lacking water. What people don't realize is the amount of water needed for animal agriculture. This water takes away from the rainforest, the community. Andersen witnessed a working grass fed farm and a duck being slaughtered. This still didn't prove that animal agriculture is necessary and good for the environment. Then he discusses the advantages of being a vegan for the environment. While animal agriculture started off good for humans, is it really good for the environment?
 Throughout the documentary, Andersen shows many different graphics. This graphics help to illustrate his points. He showed that the amount of water needed for one animal would flood a neighborhood. The amount of waste created by animals in agriculture covered most of major cities across the world, some states and some countries. Having a visual is more impactful then just hearing the words. Seeing how much land is needed in an omnivore diet compared to a vegetarian diet and vegan diet means more. You are able to understand the differences because you can see them.
 I would recommend this documentary to people interested in the environment. I liked the humor he has throughout the documentary. It provides a little relief to all of the serious and over welling facts that are being told in the film. Also, I liked the visual graphics that they used throughout the film. It helped explain the information, so that everyone would be able to understand it. Finally, I liked that every aspect of the environment was talked about, the ocean, the rainforest and everyday land. It built a very convincing argument because it showed how much our world is affected by animal agriculture.",1483315200,8,2776,4.976293103448276
6980192,4,B00SEAAZ7G,"""There is one single industry destroying the planet more than any other, (Cowspiracy, 2014).  This movie praises vegan eaters; I on the other hand, love to eat meat and that is why I was so intrigued to watch Cowspiracy. Not only will it push you into possibly changing your diet, but it will also change the way you think about your health, the environment, and animals. . At first, I thought the documentary would put the main focus on cows but, shockingly enough, the film is not just about cows, farms, or meat. Instead, the documentary explores the effects on our environment, humans, and agriculture while exploring the governments secrecy behind it all.
 To continue, one of the quotes that really stood out to me was: Each day, a person who eats a vegan diet saves 1,100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 square feet of  forested  land, 20 lbs. of CO2, and an animals life, (Cowspiracy, 2014) I was also left in complete utter shock when I hear about how 51% of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by livestock and their byproducts while only 13% is due to transportation (road, rail, air, and marine).  Additionally, Livestock is responsible for 65% nitrous oxide emissions which is a GHG 296x more destructive that CO2! This documentary has also taught me that a plant based diet cutes your carbon emission levels down by 50%! Not only that, but animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction (Cowspiracy, 2014).
Based on the facts I have heard from the movie, I came to the conclusion that we can make a difference by eating less animal products and replace our meal plans with more plants. A person who follows a vegan diet produces 50% less CO2 and uses 1/11th oil, 1/13th water, and 1/18th land compared to a meat eater, (Cowspiracy, 2014).  In addition, I was surprised to hear that animal agriculture uses an average of 52 trillion gallons of water annually and it is responsible for 85% of US water consumption. Growing feed crops for livestock alone, consumes 56% of water in the US! And did you know that one hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to make it? In the documentary, it was stated that the amount of water used to make a hamburger is equivalent to two months worth of showers, (Cowspiracy, 2014).
In conclusion, Cowspiracy is one of the best documentaries I have seen yet. The film explores the devastating impacts of animal agriculture while investigating government and environmental organizations throughout the process. Cowspiracy did a phenomenal job at exposing the truth while describing how we contribute to the main problem by consuming meat.",1481587200,3,2666,4.861233480176211

6980197,3,B00SEAAZ7G,"Here is my take. I think this is a critical issue. I think the solution is kind of right. However I have some major issues with the documentary.

First of all they portray the information as being new. Just because the director has not heard about this before, doesn't mean it is new. He calls it research, but he is doing simple trivial google searches. The content has been known for close to 30-40 years.

Secondly the director puts governmental workers in a position where they cannot answer questions, and then set it up as if there is this big conspiracy. It is not. Present the facts, and set it up as action lists about what can be done. How we can help change policy, not like some kind of conspiracy.

I am all for conservation and I agree with the basic premise and some of the solutions, but I am not sure if an emotional argument is the best way to achieve something. This has to be done on a policy level, and just getting people angry and scared will not be the best way to make a change.",1469404800,5,1003,4.268421052631579
6980198,5,B00SEAAZ7G,"An evidence based documentary highlighting meat production's role as the world's largest polluter and fresh water consumer. 51% of the world's carbon emissions are due to meat production, and 80-90% of the US fresh-water supply is used in meat production.

Other well-referenced factoids discussed:
One pound of hamburger = 2,500 gallons of fesh water from field to plate
One pound of Cheese = 900 gallons of water
One pound of eggs = 477 gallons of water
Livestock covers 45% of the world's total land (50% of the contiguous United States)
2,500 cows produce the same amount of waste as a city of 411,000 people (Miami).

And why is the public kept in the dark about this? It turns out that the leading environmentalist groups are paid to keep quiet by big-agriculture. Instead, the focus is shifted to the public, telling us to turn off the tap to save water. Why do none of them advocate just consuming less or no meat, which would cure the entire western US's water shortage problem over-night? A one-pound pound burger uses the equivalent amount of fresh water as letting your tap drip for a year, or taking three to four month's worth of long showers. And that is using the conservative end of the statistics, if you actually look at the sources, one pound of beef can require up to 8,000 gallons of water.

He argues that there is not enough room for grass fed livestock and that if we converted that much land for raising cattle it would be more problematic than grain fed cattle.  He does not account for the economic side.  If grass fed became more popular, what would most likely happen is that the price for beef would rise dramatically and fewer could actually afford to eat and and wouldn't.  A more historical approach to his problem would have revealed this, as before and during WWII, most American's only ate meat once a week.  Eating meat everyday was for the rich and the average american had a mostly (local) grain, fruit, and vegetable diet.  Instead of demonizing all livestock, he should demonize industrial agriculture (which he does, but also does more).  It is those methods that are causing tremendous problems he accurately describes.  I was often frustrated by his poor logic when working through some of these complex problems, and he would have benefited tremendously be looking at agriculture historically rather than just demonizing the whole.",1466726400,8,1291,4.967441860465116

 In the environmental documentary, ""Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret,"" released on June 26, 2014, filmmakers Kip Andersen and Keenan Kuhn present an unfamiliar yet catastrophic problem: animal agriculture. They examine the everyday life of the typical omnivorous human, where the meat and dairy that they consume comes from, and the ultimate toll producing that much food takes on the planet. Additionally, they uncover the harshness of the agriculture industry, and the efforts of large corporations to conceal that information for their financial benefit. As if the claims aren't believable enough, the filmmakers use a variety of sources ranging from real people in the agriculture field and the opposition, as well as statistics. Their final solution to the agriculture crisis is to stop eating meat altogether and to adopt a vegan lifestyle.
 While watching the film, it truly made me pause and question my everyday lifestyle, in a way I have never done before. I give it credit for that, since I pride myself on living my life without remorse or regret. I believe this is a major strength of the film, the way it has the power to connect with an immense amount of people, whether you eat meat and dairy or not. The filmmakers did an excellent job of working the film around this concept, using relatable statistics such as this one, ""1,000 gallons of water are required to produce 1 gallon of milk."" What typical American family doesn't drink milk? Does the milk I drink every morning with my cereal contribute to our environmental crisis? Do I need to reevaluate the possibly selfish way I live my life?
 Aside from being quite relatable to my everyday American lifestyle, ""Cowspiracy"" also showed me the consequences that my omnivorous diet has on my health and the environment. Not only did I learn that a vegan lifestyle is much healthier for you; it also lessens your ecological footprint. I never could have imagined the severe impact that animal agriculture has on our planet until watching this movie. This fact, straight from the movie, sums up why our world would be better if it were a vegan world: ""Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction."" This is the type of stuff that makes you stare at your steak wondering what kind of damage this 8oz piece of meat has done before it got to your dinner table. Trust me.
 Although I believe the film does an excellent job of expanding on its main focus point, animal agriculture, I think there could have been a bit more of a focus on the solution, a vegan lifestyle. Personally, I would have been interested in learning more about an everyday vegan diet, as opposed to all of my meat and dairy. Still, I wouldn't exactly label this a shortcoming for ""Cowspiracy.""
 My recommendation for this documentary is broad, because as I stated before, it has the power to relate to almost everyone. Orietta Estrada, a fellow film reviewer at The Dodo, has a quite similar recommendation, ""Whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, Meatless Monday supporter, pescatarian, or an organic-loving meat eater, after watching this film you'll be left thinking, a lot, about your everyday food choices and how those choices impact the sustainability of our planet."" The animal agriculture business impacts not only every human, but all life on planet earth. ""Cowspiracy"" is a must see.
 Overall, ""Cowspiracy"" made me more aware of the consequences of the choices I make in my life, and I guarantee it will for you too. Although veganism isn't for everyone, I think it's so important to at least be conscious of what has to happen before your food reaches your dinner table. ""Cowspiracy"" genuinely opened my eyes and got me thinking more about my diet, and to be able to do that to me of all people is a huge success.",1459814400,20,3891,4.91476407914764
6980204,4,B00SEAAZ7G,"Cowspiracy is a documentary film directed by Kip Anderson and published in 2014. This film is directed towards people who consider themselves environmentalists or who want sustainability. This film explores the destruction that the world is facing because of animal agriculture. It goes into depth about why being a vegan would not only be better for the planet, but better for the humans as well. This film also discusses why certain industries or people will not admit that animal agriculture is the number one reason our planet suffers. All of these things are brought together to send a strong message and hopefully change the views and actions of people.
This film is portrayed very well. The message it sends is compelling and offers lots of reasoning as to why this film is so important. The main star of the film, Kip Anderson, made everything about this film convincing and powerful. He was very emotional, which drew the audience in. You could tell how important this was to him. He also offered lots of concrete evidence proving that animal agriculture is the leading problem in the United States. The more people he interviewed the more I saw how much of a problem this really was. They all denied anything about animal agriculture even when presented with facts. I honestly was shocked that these major environmental groups were ignoring such a huge problem in our planet.  The way Kip stood up for what he thought was right was very inspiring. I also liked that he compared what people think is the main problem to what the actual problem is. It showed how much more animal agriculture is hurting us than cars or whatever else people think is the cause. That was crazy to see.
Overall, Cowspiracy is powerful and able to send such a strong message, but at the same time I did not find it motivating enough to change my own lifestyle. This is such a controversial film, so I expected to not one hundred percent agree. With that said, this film still offers so many astonishing facts and problems that I did not even know about. Anyone would benefit out of watching this film, but mostly the people who are legitimately interested in sustainability. I gained a lot of perspective from watching this film because of how damaging animal agriculture is. I want our planet to survive forever and continue to prosper, but from this film it doesnt look like that is going to happen. I definitely hope that down the road this problem will go away and maybe that will take everyone to become vegan to do so. If that is the case, I would change my lifestyle as long as I knew the world was making this change. This film was eye opening, but for now, I can not make the change in my life that Kip would want, but who knows about the future. Either way this film is worth the watch and I definitely recommend watching it.",1458777600,10,2822,4.632734530938124

Just trying to live. At least pick on something that isn't fallowing its natural instincts. Heaven forbid if a cows gotta drink. For someone who wants people to not eat meat, I don't think they are doing it because they love the animals? Because who really hates cows that much? They don't do anything!

8698214,4,B00SEAAZ7G,"Cowspiracy aptly puts into perspective the many factors that are currently contributing to climate change, the most significant of which is cattle consumption  the flims focal point. This is done by way of extensive first hand interviews, data that are presented throughout the film and animations/infographics that break down factors contributing to climate change. Furthermore, interactions between Kip Andersen (the director) and individuals from environmental organizations expose the extensive politicking and hypocrisy that is inherent to addressing climate change. This is of particular importance so that viewers are able to see the truth behind the issue of climate change and can form opinions about the root cause, so that we are not left feeling discouraged due to our inability to impact change.
 Throughout the film, the interviews that were conducted seemed slightly intrusive at times, but they assisted in providing a proper portrayal of the stance that entire organizations take topics related to climate change. Not only do the interviews add this level of personalization, they also promote the idea that there should be an open dialogue on the topic of climate change, that will hopefully aid in convincing more individuals that it is a very real phenomenon that requires immediate preventative action. In addition, the data/statistical information that the director provides throughout the film serve to consolidate the argument that he makes for global climate change. Although, at times the facts that he presents seem questionable, not necessarily in terms of the actual values, but in terms of the context from which they may have been drawn and that which they were placed into. Lastly, the infographics and animation that are utilized throughout the film are relatable and make tangible the many statistics that are provided.
 When it came to the visual representations of animals and nature in the film, they were often hyper-sensationalized, which is understandable, given the urgency of the situation, in regards to climate change. The costs of slightly exaggerating the impact of climate change on our globe are far outweighed by the benefits that may be incurred in the form of the emotional appeal of the sensationalized imagery. This decision in terms of the portrayal of the nature-related images in the film also ties in to the strong pro-climate change bias of the director. Again, given the current situation and urgency of issues surrounding global climate change, the director was justified in presenting the film with such a bias as it may encourage viewers to reorient their viewpoints to be more in line with those of the director.
 The other role that the director plays in terms of his interaction with the environmental organizations, is one of exposing and publicizing their inherent hypocrisy. He shows that although these organizations pose as pro-environment, they are unwilling to address the largest contributing factors to climate change as this would coincide with a loss of funding. He further goes on to show that even some of the most credible environmental organizations such as Greenpeace are unwilling to address cattle contributions to climate change, by way of deforestation and general pollution. The hypocrisy also extends into government agencies which subsidize and support raising cattle and other agricultural activities that result in enormous dead-zones and ocean acidification, to name a few of the negative impacts.
 But the extensive doom and gloom that is portrayed throughout the film isn't without resolve. Solutions are worked in so that viewers are informed as to which actions they may take in order to curtail their impact on climate change. Though the primary point of action that the filmmakers propose is reducing or stopping cattle consumption, the implications of such fundamental change may not be taken lightly by many viewers. As such, a more effective approach may have been a way of introducing substitutes for cattle products that are so extensively consumed and resultant in the impacts that we see today.
 Overall, the film properly portrays the reality of the situation that we face in terms of climate change and rightly calls attention to the primary cause of the current global climate situation. Although, at times hyper-sensationalized imagery and questionable data may be presented, the strong emotional and personal appeals of the film serve to motivate action and salience when it comes to cattle consumption and the resultant climate change. What Cowspiracy presents is a step towards the positive direction that we should all take in hope of preserving and improving our earth for generations to come.",1521158400,,4706,5.335579514824798
