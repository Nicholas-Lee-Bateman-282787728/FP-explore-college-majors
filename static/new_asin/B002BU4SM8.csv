8361921,4,B002BU4SM8,This is a great collection if for nothing else than the great animations. I also love the music on them - made it the days when live orchestras supplied the music. These cartoons are funny; not ugly.,1373155200,,199,4.405405405405405

8361923,1,B002BU4SM8,"Being that Warner has taken a break from their release schedule with the official DVDs, I decided to check out this release as it contains the later color shorts.  I figured it would tide me over until the Warner sets come out.  I was first surprised to see that these are DVD-R discs, not factory pressed.  Anyway, I sat down to watch this and neither of the two discs would play in one of my DVD players in my home theater (it said ""format not supported"").  My other DVD player, which is region free, would play disc 1 and I was appalled at the horrible video and audio quality.  They all appear to be low bitrate with tons of macro blocking artifacts and audio dropouts.  The printing on the cover says NTSC/PAL and I figured I was given a PAL disc by accident.  So surely it should play in my computer too, right?  Wrong.  This was sent back for a prompt refund.  The seller didn't offer to replace them either, which I found interesting.",1249776000,11,942,4.362068965517241

This one is definately better than most, especially for the price.
