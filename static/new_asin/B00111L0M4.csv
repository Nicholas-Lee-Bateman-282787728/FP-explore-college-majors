8239853,5,B00111L0M4,"This movie is about as indie as it gets.  As in it was probably financed by an individual person.  However after receiving this film as a gift, I realized that it has a lot of heart.  It is especially cool if you live in Northern California and can see Rick St. Charles in random commercials, playing funny characters, and can relate to the vibe throughout.  The script is actually good, the plot is coherent and unique, and the actors do an excellent job.  Nothing within it was done poorly, which I think stands out as an accomplishment for a movie made without much production value.

All in all it is a 5/5 for being solid, coherent, and true to itself.

The Fapcom representative was hilarious, as well.",1455840000,,708,4.52755905511811
