8289711,5,B001CUBBW8,"The Wicked is an entertaining popcorn film! It's no Citizen Kane and it's not suppose to be taken seriously. The movie itself is a high octane of vengeance, violence, gore and an on going feud between Templar Knights and Satanists in a modern day world!  Its definitely more played off like a comic book, filled with cool visuals, sword fights, gun fights and over the top violence! Not to mention baby's being impaled through the wall and a homicidal abortion, which gives the feeling of something straight out of a Japanese anime! The special effects and acting can be a little hammy at times, but that's what gives this film it's charm. Definitely worth taking a look.",1392595200,,671,4.735042735042735
8289712,5,B001CUBBW8,"This is a really low-budget film with an overwhelming amount of factions ranging from Satanists, to modern day Knights Templar to traitors within the cult and a power struggle that is a bit hard to keep track of because there is so much going on. But the great thing is there is plenty of gore effects that will simply blow your mind considering the low budget. There is a twisted scene of a pregnant woman that is absolutely disturbing and horrifying. A lot of credit must good to the director who has done one other film ""Hardcore Poisoned Eyes"", a hard to find cult classic which I have seen and recommend. The actors in The Wicked are good. There are some scattered fine performances. The scene with Jackie Martling made be laugh so hard I nearly fell on the floor! If you're in the mood for a different kind of horror film, I highly recommend this.",1392336000,,853,4.4743589743589745
8289713,5,B001CUBBW8,"More of a strange fantasy horror than straight up horror. It's very low budget and the acting ranges from great to okay to crazy. But this ""horror"" film sure does entertain! Some parts of this movie are gory and crazy as hell. A fun low budget independent movie.",1392249600,,262,4.479166666666667
8289714,1,B001CUBBW8,"WORST MOVIE EVER. JACKIE THE JOKEMAN MARTLING WAS THE BEST PART; AND THAT IS NOT SAYING MUCH! PLEASE, DON'T WATCH THIS!!!",1366243200,,121,4.809523809523809
8289715,4,B001CUBBW8,I am so happy to see Jackie Marltings break-out movie from leaving the Howard Stern Show on it's decline! Jackie was brilliant in forseeing Howard's shows decline and was smart to leave the 25 million on the table for the stern show to break out in this monster of a hit! Jackie is a genius and can;t wait until he gets his due with an oscar!,1329436800,4,342,4.196969696969697
8289716,2,B001CUBBW8,"To tell the truth, I purchased this movie because my sister is one of the main characters.  I guess I'm a little bias and can't really tell you if I laughed so much due to watching my sister or the cheesiness of the movie.  Laughing probably isn't such a good thing since it's a horror movie.  guess you'll just have to buy it and watch it yourself.",1225584000,,349,4.17910447761194
