8368227,3,B002EQA0XK,"Night of the Strangler (1972) centers around a white girl who falls in love with and gets pregnant by a black man. When the two are mysteriously killed, the investigation focuses on the girl's two brothers, Vance, who is kind and was supportive of his sister, and Dan, an arrogant racist who would rather have seen his sister have an abortion than have a black man's baby. A black priest who tries to console the two brothers throughout the film also adds to the increasingly obvious tension.

Night of the Strangler is pretty low-budget but has a good (and, for 1972, very controversial) plot. low-budget horror viewing for chilling lovers.",1385942400,,641,4.827272727272727
8368228,3,B002EQA0XK,"I didn't have a lot of hope for ""Night of the Strangler"" when I put the DVD in and the only option was to play the feature, a film that looks as though it's been through several wars; the color balance is so bad it's tremendously off-putting to watch from the opening frame. The film stars Micky Dolenz in his natural post-season two of ""The Monkees"" pseudo-afro. The film centers around racism in 1972 New Orleans, with Micky as Vance, the nurturing Vietnam vet and florist who wants to help his sister, playing against the evil brother Dan (James Ralston,) Vance's diametric opposite. The girl and her lover are killed (you'll love the hippie assassin) for very politically incorrect reasons, but even though their deaths form the nucleus of the plot, they almost seem like unnecessary storyline diversions given the subsequent onscreen action.

While the story is modestly engaging, the specifics are frequently eye-rolling: the police work and binocular standoff are terrible, the super weird weapons are frequently way over-the-top (e.g. watch for the bride's encounter with an arrow, which is substantially odder than I could describe, so I won't even try) and of course there's a stunning concluding fight between Vance and Dan (which had been foreshadowed since about minute two of the film.) Fitting with the whole over-the-top motif, most of the actors have unreal quantities of scenery chewing on display here. Though some of his scenes are spot on, some of Dolenz' scenes are positively bonkers, though in fairness it's a trait shared by most of the other performers at times. The overall best performance came from Chuck Patterson in a dual role as Father Jessie and Jake (which makes for a nice plot twist very late in the film.) Contrasting with the fevered performances, the credits of the film made me laugh out loud (just watch them and see for yourself.) It was made in New Orleans with the help of the New Orleans Police Department, so there are moments of realism sprinkled amongst the overacting. It all combines into an oddly mesmerizing but unseemly amalgam, which is worth watching once.",1378080000,3,2112,4.949295774647887
