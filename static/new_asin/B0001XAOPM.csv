2042339,4,B0001XAOPM,"Save the execrable Dr T and the Women, every Robert Altman picture is worth the price of admission.  Some, of course, are monuments; my personal favorite, and a top 10 ever, is Nashville.
The Company hardly approaches Altman's heights, but it has many pleasures.  For anyone who loves ballet, the work of the dancers in the Joffrey Company of Chicago is spectacular and wonderfully filmed.  Malcolm McDowell as the company director is a benign and beloved tyrant.  Watch him take possession of his personal chair in each scene where it appears.  Watch him with his endless adjustments and caressings of the gold scarf he always wears. Personally, I found the concluding ballet -- Blue Snake -- ludicrous and, unlike Nashville and Gosford Park, the characters in the ensemble acting never take much flight as individuals.  Three scenes of differing length are Altman at his height, however.  First comes the outdoor stage pas a deux where Neve Campbell first steps from company toward prima.  She and her partner dance as a thunderstorm gathers and then begins to drench the audience, umbrellas open, the dancers continue, danger and sensuality commingle.  It is wonderful stuff and goes on for minutes and minutes.  Second, a dancer snaps a tendon as she lands after a jump and, in a quick but perfect scene, watches on crutches from the spotlit wings as her cover commands the role at the performance that night.  Finally, the Christmas roast the Company does of the McDowell character and the Blue Snake choreographer is five or so minutes where the trademark Altman ensemble direction really works.
The Company is not perfect, probably not even great Altman, but that's still way better than 90 percent of your box office options.",1074902400,2,1733,4.982638888888889
2042340,5,B0001XAOPM,"I went to see this movie because I'm a big Neve Campbell fan.
To be honest I didn't know what to expect.  I'm not a big fan of
ballet (the one I did see put me to sleep).
Boy was I surprised at just how much I loved this movie.  It is
mesmorizing,  graceful and has a beauiful feel to it.  Every ballet scene has an almost hypnotic effect.  I just couldn't keep
my eyes off of the screen.  It had a very cathartic effect on me.
It was also special because I know that is Neve's project.  She's
been working on it for years.  Bravo Neve you did it and it's
magnificent!
A must see film.",1074384000,5,585,3.9401709401709404
2042341,5,B0001XAOPM,"For the ballet fan, this is a brilliant movie.  It's likely the first ballet movie to give the viewer an authentic sense of what ballet is really like, behind the scenes, day-by-day, in a performing company.  In this case, the company is the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, whose dancers participated in the picture.  The director is Robert Altman, and the movie is magnificently produced, filmed, and performed.  The Joffrey emerges from the film looking like the best ballet company in the world and gains from it the best of all possible advertisements.
Neve Campbell, the film's star, had been a professional dancer and had trained at Canada's National School of Ballet from age 9 (she started dancing at age 6).  She gave up dancing because a long history of injuries (about 40, in all) intersected with an increasing number of acting opportunities.  When she was cast in ""Party of Five"" at age 20, the acting took over her career.
Her contributions to the picture are staggering to contemplate.  The seven-year project that it represents was Campbell's dream.  Briefly (and over-simplified), she conceived the idea, sold it, co-wrote the story with Barbara Turner, and nursed the project through an intensive final three-year gestation period, where she and Turner commuted to Chicago to spend time with the Joffrey observing classes, rehearsals, and performances and getting to know the dancers.  Then Turner and Campbell persuaded Altman to direct the film, after which Campbell spent 4 1/2 months of 8 1/2-hour days dancing herself back into performing shape and another 1 1/2 months of 8 1/2-hour days dancing with the Joffrey prior to the start of shooting.
Three days before she was to join the company, she broke a rib.  She danced through the month-and-a-half with the Joffrey and the entire filming with that injury.  She performed not only as the movie's dramatic but also as its ballet star.  She did all of her own dance scenes and also served as co-producer.  Her acting and her dancing in ""The Company"" are both superb.
The dance sequences are sensationally good and sensationally well filmed.  Perhaps the best of a most memorable lot is Campbell's and partner Domingo Rubio's performance of ""My Funny Valentine,"" a pas de deux ballet, in an outdoor Chicago venue as a summer storm rolls in, lending its thunder, lightning, wind, and rain accompaniment to the on-stage trio and the Lar Lubovitch choreography.  This is the same ballet that American Ballet Theatre has performed with Sandra Brown and Julie Kent dancing Campbell's role.  Lubovitch originally made the ballet on Sandra Brown.  Indeed, a very brief rehearsal-tape clip of ABT's Sandra Brown and Marcelo Gomes is shown being watched by Joffrey personnel and the choreographer as they prepare the ballet for performance.
The audience for the movie may be narrow because the picture is all about ballet, a ballet company, and the way those associated with that company lead their lives; in many cases in a state of near-poverty, which is tolerable in exchange for the opportunity to dance (Campbell's character has a second job as a waitress to help pay the rent).  ""The Company"" has the flavor of a documentary, albeit a considerably enhanced one, because its focus on dance, ballet culture, and the ambience of dancers' lives does not permit an elaborate problem-solution or beginning-middle-end story line.  Think Frederick Wiseman (a la his ABT documentary) with dialog and a near-heroine.
Campbell did not want this movie to be the standard corps-to-stardom ballet melodrama, and she did not want it to be about her.  While it is clear that she is one of the film's principal interests, she pretty successfully blends into the body of the company, which really is the film's principal interest.  For fans of ballet, it is the best ballet movie ever made.  There is nothing phony or artificial or sentimental about it.  The message is simple and direct: This is the way it is in the ballet world.
And it is beautifully cast and wonderfully acted in those segments where there is the opportunity for acting.  Malcolm McDowell, as the company's artistic director, is splendid.  James Franco, as Campbell's love interest of the moment, is as fully beautiful a person as she.  And Campbell is heroic in any dimension one cares to name.  A single measure of that: When the film concluded its shooting, Gerald Arpino, the real-life artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, asked Campbell to join the real-life company.",1073952000,,4493,5.012113055181696
2042342,4,B0001XAOPM,"When I first found myself getting seriously involved in movies for some reason or another I took Robert Altman for granted. I knew him strictly as the film-maker of ""M*A*S*H"" and didn't care to see anything he made. Then about 2 or 3 years ago I started watching his movies. I have always heard people say wonderful things about him and I thought it was about time I check out his films. He immediately became one of my favorite American directors. And his work since the 90's, sort of his ""comback"" years have greatly impressed me. ""Shorts Cuts"" I think is his masterpiece, he then followed that films with ""Kansas City"", ""The Gingerbread Man"", ""Cookie's Fortune"" and his previous film ""Gosford Park"", which made us all think of Jean Renoir's ""Rules of the Game"". All of this makes it seem somewhat odd then that he would follow the critical successful ""Gosford Park"", which he was nominated for an Oscar, with a movie about ballet, but, I guess that just goes to show you what kind of versital talent Altman really is.
 As I walked into ""The Company"" I thought I would enjoy it because Altman was directing, but I didn't know I'd come out enjoying it as much as I do. With this film Altman fully displays his talents for detail, every one of his movies has a spontaneous feel to it. Sometimes we think we are seeing things we shouldn't be. As if it's the rehearsal, his movies have a very breezy attitude. ""The Company"" and I know how shocking it may seem, is actually one of his best films. There are moments when watching this movie I had to remind myself it's a movie and not a documentary. Altman's style of filmmaking is perfect for this movie. He captures moments that seem so real. We honestly forget we are watching actors.
 A lot of people it seems have been staying away from this movie. It has been doing very poorly at the box-office, sadly a good number of Altman's films were not commercially successful. But I'm afraid those who do go see it may not like it because they will say it has no story. It's just about dancing. Well, first of all lets remember the name of the movie, ""The Company"", secondly no one has been hiding the fact this movie is about ballet, so yes, a great deal of the movie is featuring dance scenes. There is a very light plot. And if I were to judge the movie on plot than I guess it would be disappointing, but you can't watch this movie and expect a heavy plot. In fact the plot is so fragile I wouldn't know how to describe it.
 We have a young woman named Ry (Neve Campbell, who also produced the movie and help with its story) who is a young talented dancer awaiting the day she can be the star of her own company. She starts a relationship with Josh (James Franco) after a bad breakup with her ex, who just happens to be a dancer who works for the same company. Then there is Mr. A (Malcolm McDowell) who is head of the company. He is having fincial trouble putting on a new show called the ""Blue Snake"". And there isn't much more to tell.
 Altman was robbed of an Oscar a few years back with ""Gosford Park"", but, someone could argue, at least they nominated him. Well, sadly Altman's great work here will go unnoticed, and it's not fair. ""The Company"" is one of the better films released in 2003.
 There is one scene I want to point out to people. There is scene were Ry and her partner or dancing, but a storm breaks out. In this moment are minds are already going to work because we think the rain will go on the stage and she'll slip and injure herself. Altman is creating such tension that movies like ""Phone Booth"" and ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" didn't make me feel. Now, I'm not going to tell you if she does injure herself or not, you'll just hae to go see the movie.
 Bottom-line: One of Robert Altman's best films. His directing style makes a perfect blend for the film's tone. Has a spontaneous feel to it that makes us forget it's only a movie.",1073692800,12,3897,4.360881542699724
2042343,5,B0001XAOPM,"THE COMPANY is a wonderful film in the tradition of Robert Altman's best films (particularly NASHVILLE, also MASH, McCABE & MRS MILLER, and SHORT CUTS).  When Altman is really ""on his game,"" no one can equal his ability to create a unique microworld which simultaneously captures its defined subject but also points out its universality.  In this case the spotlight is on the Joffrey Ballet Company of Chicago, so there are tense rehearsal scenes followed by gorgeous performance scenes.  Daily life in ""The Company"" depicts the universal desire of all artists to ""get it right"" -- the effort they go thru day in & day out to perfect each tiny detail so that the end result looks ""easy"" to the audience.  The film challenges its audience to understand that this quest is just as true for the filmmakers making this film as it is of the dancers that the film embraces.  In other words, it looks like a ""documentary"" but it's actually tightly scripted.  Each time you watch it, you will see more & more because each of the character's specific arcs will become more & more clear to you.  Is it worth the effort?  Well, if you are someone who's seen NASHVILLE multiple times, then yes.  The first time I saw NASHVILLE, I watched to see WHAT would happen.  The second time, I wanted to know who did it.  (If you know NASHVILLE, then you'll know that the ""what"" is an assassination.)  It wasn't until the third time that I actually understood why one particular person X killed another particular person Y.  Same here - although the plot elements are more delicate (as befits the milieu).  Suffice it to say that you'll know you've mastered THE COMPANY when every act in the Christmas Roast makes you laugh as hard as the dancers in the scene are laughing.  Final Words: See this at least once on a big screen if at all possible, because the dance numbers are truly magnificent!",1073606400,5,1873,4.633333333333334

It was cool and all to see Neve Campbell dance, but other than that I can't think of anything good to say about this film.  I should have bought Center Stage!",1378512000,,428,4.246913580246914
2042363,4,B0001XAOPM,"Neve Campbell guides the viewer on a cinema verite journey behind the stage curtain to reveal a ballet company that is not unlike The Joffrey Ballet, with several members of that Chicago company making appearances.

Campbell adopts the personal of the star ballerina, Trinity to provide a point-of-view on the secret interior life of a dancer, the intense emotion and physicality of dance, and the culture of the dance world. The highlight of the movie is Trinity's strong performance of Light Rain.

While dancers appear to float like butterflies, balance on the heads of pins, fly on the wings of angels, and bend like pretzels without a care in the world, The Company provides the audience with an understanding of the time, energy, and passion that dance requires.

With strong participation from the supporting cast, The Company is easier on the viewer's psyche done as romantic drama. Though there is a realistic injury during an important duet, the viewer is saved from the bone-crunching body horror of The Black Swan.

2042364,2,B0001XAOPM,This movie really had a very shallow if any storyline.  I was disappointed and I am a dance teacher. Not good.,1377043200,,110,4.238095238095238
2042365,4,B0001XAOPM,"That description fits just about every movie that Robert Altman made and is especially true in the case of THE COMPANY. It took the arrival of DVDs and the subtitle option before I finally began to appreciate and enjoy Altman as a director. Two of his signature trademarks are overlapping dialogue and organic development of his plots & characters rather than conventional storytelling. Altman said he deliberately did this because he wanted his audiences to pay more attention and focus in on what his characters were doing. Although probably unintended, it also boosted ticket sales as you had to see the movie more than once to figure out was going on. It had the opposite effect on me. All it did was to irritate and frustrate me so that I eventually lost interest and usually zoned out after about the first hour. Had I seen THE COMPANY back in 2003 when it first came out, I'm sure that would have been the result.

Once Altman's movies arrived on DVD, I revisited them and began to run the subtitles which allowed me to catch all the dialogue and it made me realize that there really is a story there it's just disguised as everyday life. Most people want a standard plotline with a beginning, a middle, and an end and a few ups and downs along the way. Altman likes to eavesdrop on his characters and what is happening to them. Other reviewers have mentioned his ""fly on the wall"" approach which is very effective once you realize what he is doing and adjust your expectations accordingly. I was just unable to do that in a movie theater. In one sense Altman is like the American composer Charles Ives in that it takes repeated exposure to his works to get what he is driving at and most people (myself included) weren't willing or capable of doing that in a public venue. In the privacy of your home though, it's a different matter.

The storyline focuses on several days in the lives of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago as they get ready for the world premiere of a difficult work. We meet several dancers (played by actual members of the company) eventually focusing on one (Neve Campbell who co-wrote and co-produced the film), her boyfriend (James Franco in an early role), and the prima donna head of the company (Malcolm MacDowell brilliantly cast against type). There are several breathtakingly executed and exquisitely photographed dance numbers along the way leading up to the big finale which showcases the Joffrey Ballet as a company and it is these numbers which make the film a must for any lover of modern dance. It's also an intimate portrait of the everyday goings on backstage and during rehearsals as well as a glimpse into the personal lives of the company members. THE COMPANY isn't for everyone, but if you really love dance and utilize the subtitle option (a must), it can be a rich and rewarding experience.",1376179200,6,2836,4.67

I think what this really was was Altman lending his time and name to help someone else do their project.  He did this for money and nothing more.  This is not really an Altman film at all.  The biggest give away is the audio track.  There mixture of multiple interchanges is just not there.  Altman should have instead done a film about the fashion industry which was something he knew and loved much more than dance.  If you love dance, do not watch this film.

2042378,1,B0001XAOPM,"... one interesting thing I noticed is that some of the dance pieces bear a resemblance to ideas from ballets well-known in the 1970's and/or 1980's, such as ""Paradise Lost"" (choreographer maybe Glen Tetley, notoriously danced by Nureyev and Fonteyn at their height of being Mod superstars.  The sets had a luscious mouth that Nureyev dove thru, outrageously.  Other dancing reminded me of ""The Ropes of Time"" (choreographed by Rudi van Dantzig, I think, and famously danced by Nureyev, among others).

It took me awhile to realize I was looking at Malcolm McDowell, the white hair confused me.  After 30 years he looks a lot different (don't we all).  I always liked that guy, I wonder what made him participate in this fiasco.

Cirque de Soleil can be enjoyable, and I like ballet, but the two combine badly.

2042379,4,B0001XAOPM,"This movie is about ballet and its dancers. It does not really have any plot. To my mind, it carries a deeper message. People who do exquisite things are just like us, ordinary folks! The dancers are divine when performing, but live ordinary `high heeled, bar tender' lives off stage, to make a living. There are no crazy creative eccentrics in this world.

The performances are excellent and have been filmed well. Director Robert Altman has done a fine job. And, the movie is packed with performances. The sound of the footsteps during the performances makes the viewer feel that this is for real. It was inspiring to see how much the body is malleable, and remains beautifully sculpted, even for ballet dancers who are in their 40's.

The movie grips you from the very start, and the juxtaposition of the backstage with the live performances has been done without jarring the smooth flow of the narrative about this world of ballet and its performers.

2042380,3,B0001XAOPM,"I watched ""the Company"" because I enjoyed the movie ""Black Swan"" so much and ""the Company"" is the only other contemporary movie I know about that centers on ballet.

In a nutshell, I'd say ""the Company"" is well-executed with some beautiful dance sequences in it...especially one that takes place at an outdoor theater with Neve Campbell (doing her own dancing since she used to be a ballerina).  I could watch that again many times...and I can only wonder if the makers of ""Black Swan"" ever thought of casting her instead of Portman (who did brilliantly in the film and did some dancing but not the really technically difficult stuff).

The problem with ""the Company"" is that it really is under-plotted and has not very much drama in it.  Except for a few intimate sequences, I almost felt like it could have been a documentary from the ""Frontline"" series on PBS.  The movie also lacks any ""climactic moment"" to it.

So watch ""the Company"" if you want to see some great dancing (and some interesting productions except for the deliberately ludicrous one at the end).  But if you want high drama and a protagonist you really care about, go see ""Black Swan.""",1293840000,,1156,4.721393034825871

The world moves on, folks.  This movie is about process. You see all the people playing their roles.  What dancers face as they try to make a living, even if they are in top shelf companies.  What administrators face as they juggle budgets with artistic goals.  You learn about what goes on in dance rehearsals and then find out what the result is on stage for the audience.  The narrative is not important.

The dance performances are stunning.

Do we need the nonsense that we get in Rocky, phony stories about overcoming phony situations?

This is Altman. He has been doing this since he became known with M*A*S*H.

2042385,3,B0001XAOPM,"I will start by saying this is an interesting and well done movie. But it is not for everyone, and even the people it IS for may have to watch it two or three times to fully understand it.

The most simple way I can put this is that generally speaking, movies and books tend to revolve around certain characters. In this movie, the characters take a back seat to the general happenings at a Dance Company. James Franco may be known as the likable and sympathetic eventual villain in ""Spiderman,"" but he hardly has anything to say in this film. He's just there to be Neve Campbell's boyfriend. Malcolm McDowell has a fair amount of screen time as the frantic, but good at his job company director. And to be fully honest, he makes the most of his screen time: ""Just so you know, you guys didn't help me one bit.""

More than anything, the movie shows how the dancers suffer difficult lives for the sake of an hour here and there on stage. It also shows how a simple injury can throw hours, weeks, months of practice down the drain.

Another character worth mentioning is the sympathetic Debby. She is a 43 year old woman who has dedicated her life to the dance, but as much as she loved it, she feels it isn't good for her to be a part of it now: ""It's not that I don't want to be in it, but at this point, it looks lime I'm working at it."" We also see through her that once somebody has learned a certain way, there comes a point where you just can't tell them to do it differently now.

In a way, this is kind of like the ballet version of ""Saturday Night Fever."" (Though without the several things that made ""Saturday Night Fever"" an R rated movie.) It is certainly an interesting watch, but again, it's not for everyone.",1232928000,,1722,4.273006134969325

I prefer to consider this Altman's truly final film and therefore his final statement (PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION, while quaintly amusing, is pretty anemic, not surprising given Altman's health during production).  It has all the markings of an artist coming to terms with his Muse and/or Moloch.  The melodrama, while sufficiently engaging, plays more like a fading illusion, relegated to the backdrop of Altman's preferences for the blurred, interrelated, and dream-like fantasia of the stage and the cinema.

2042391,2,B0001XAOPM,"This movie is not a documentary, neither does it have a story / narrative driving events.  It is an undisputably Altman-esque view of life in a successful ballet company, in this case the Joffrey Ballet Company.

This means that events simply unfold in a matter of fact and realistic way, with characters stumbling over phrases and talking over each other in a way that gradually convinces you this is a peek into real life rather than a `movie'.  If ballet, in particular modern ballet, fascinates you, and you like Altman's style of direction, then this is the movie for you.

Having said that, if ballet does NOT fascinate, you may well be left cold by a movie which has no story to tell, but rather purports to show real life instead.

The performances are fantastic, as you would expect from Robert Altman.  Malcolm McDowell is a treat as the ballet director.. a role that Roger Ebert astutely observed is very like Altman himself, overseeing the creative process with one eye always on the budget, and those around him subject to his acerbic put downs, or throwaway praises. More than once he shouts out `You're a genius!' while simultaneously walking out of the room and already thinking about something or someone else.  During the ballet training, you can feel the dancers groan as he interrupts shouting out `What are you doing! You made it pretty! I HATE pretty!'.

Neve Campbell was the driving force behind getting the movie made.  She trained in Canada as a ballet dancer, and put in 4 months of training to get in shape for this role.  It was she who persuaded Altman to make the movie, after his initial disinterest.  This makes it all the more remarkable how un star-like a vehicle this is for her.  Her character is just one character within the company and never overshadows the pace and style of the movie.

What we get then, is snippets of real lives and loves of all the players of a ballet company, interspersed with occasionally lengthy scenes of the ballets themselves. The performances certainly are convincing, but the end result is an oddly dispassionate but intimate view into the world of ballet.

This is not Altman at his best.  I find he works best when there IS a plot and story, which distracts you from the fact that the movie is really about the people not the story.  Such was the case in his previous movie, Gosford Park.  Here, what you see is what you get and there are no layers to unwrap.  Therefore, whether you enjoy the movie or not will depend greatly on your interest in the creative process on display, and in modern ballet itself.",1173571200,6,2580,4.645374449339207

I immensely enjoyed the dancing and training scenes.  This alone justifies watching the film from beginning to end.

Neve Campbell is an up and coming dancer with a Joffrey-esque dance company. She is given the lead in a new ballet.  The film centers around this and the operations of the company.

This is a great movie that gives insight about a dance company and the creative process.  It supports great performances by Neve Campbell and the ever chameleon like Malcolm McDowell.  Add  to this some great dance sequences and you have the second best film about ballet.

""The Company"" is just that.  It doesn't have much plot or shall I say two-dimensional and more emphasis is put onto ballet performances by Chicago's Joffrey Group.  Whilst the DVD introduction said that it's a movie about having a dancer having to choose between her boyfriend or a career, it's not portrayed dramatically as an art movie might.  It's simply an alibi to have the movie made.  Yes, through the course of the movie, we would witness the life of an artistic director, Malcolm McDowell (who's supposed to be an Italian here but speaking perfect stiff upper lip English); set designer; the lifestyle of the dancers (lots of hardwork, training, and at times, in vain) et cetera.

That's the reason most people got into that movie 'Flash Dance'...""I'm a dancer"" lunacy.  If you're a stage dancer, then dance. You don't have some special qualification to critique this film because of that.  And why are you so obsessed with dance movies in the first place?  ""I want to spread the joy and recruit with it."" To Sally Sue running a dance class in a backwoods town trying to get all her friends to watch it and join her in ""the quest for movement"", give it a freak'n rest already!  Lordy.  This is not made to cater for or against that crowd.  Altman doesn't do that.  If you got that impression from the movie, you need your head examined.  This is a separate animal from those other dance promotional films.  There have been other films that have attempted this, but got screwed over by their studio.  'Havana Nights' was originally very different than it turned out, for instance.  The whole 'Dirty Dancing' connection was a bastardization of the writer's concept.  See 'The Player' for Altman's thoughts on Hollywood for an understanding of why this film is not in that category.  'The Company' is an exploration of the behind-the-scenes reality of an art form from the perspectives of individuals who have made (or are trying to make) it their sole profession.  Altman's eye once again has an objective, slightly distant documentary-like style to it, but in a way I don't think could be captured with a real documentary crew standing around.  And yet in spite of this, it is quite an intimate character piece.  You get these moments of character and situational truth again and again throughout that are universal to people, to professionalism, to art, and yet also have a unique take from this particular field.

Kind of like what you might see on extras about the making of a movie. Some of the dance scenes were interesting, but the  plot was definitely lacking. I couldn't tell you what the conflict was supposed to be from watching. And the nudity was unnecessary - I don't like seeing naked people on screen, but if it's for a purpose that's one thing; this was purposeless. A lot of the scenes really seemed pointless.

This is Neve Campbell's finest hour and as Malcolm McDowell said in one of the many superb interviews, if you can get Robert Altman on board, you have to be taken seriously. Likewise, to get a  master such as McDowell, you have to have a very credible idea and a great deal of talent and passion. Neve has it all.

While the film is a virtual documentary snapshot of a period in the Joffrey's life, it is very coherent and organic, and avoids the pitfalls of some of the more pretentious, non-linear Art movies. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. Not everybody is a Cocteau or a Warhol.

I liked the fact that the story is relatively non-hierarchical, and that Neve wasn't up on a pedestal. This works beautifully because it captures the cameraderie that exists in all good ballet/theater companies.

I would like to have seen a little more of Malcolm McDowell's character, as he is a joy to behold in the way he fully becomes the character, as all good actors do, Neve included. The soundtrack is as exquisite as the many brilliant dance sequences, and the Special Features are wonderful.

2042410,5,B0001XAOPM,"As a former dancer and one who participated in many performances, I have to admit this movie was like a living memory for me. I think, for a person to truly enjoy and appreciate this movie, they have to have either been involved in the performing arts at one point in their life, or have a deep appreciation for what the performing arts really are.

The manner in which this movie was filmed, makes one feel as though they are a member of the Joffery Ballet, themselves, living the life a dancer lives.  There is a fluid, active plot, that is true to life as it occurs. This movie will be lost on mainstream movie-goers who need high action, intricately over involved plot lines and theaterics. That is why we have Hollywood.  This film, reminds us, why we have the arts. It is a painful, draining devotion both on the body and the emotions, but we continue to do it because we are in love with it, and are addicted to the incredible result we get.

It is the subtleties that makes this movie great.  The arrogance of the ballet's director, and the veteran dancers.  The flakiness and brilliance of the choreographers.  The part where Neve Campbell's character goes home after her big performance in the beginning and bursts into tears while drawing a bath.  The girls discussing their nausea while learning to perform the dance piece on the swing. The dancers crowding into small apartments to find a place to live. The subtlety in the different ways a dancer movies his or her hips or defies gravity in their jumps that makes them superior to other dancers in the corps..

The performances that are filmed are what make the Joffery Ballet superb. The mixture of modern dance and classical ballet.  This is a fantastic film, and anyone who truly KNOWS the performing arts, will understand it as that.",1113696000,25,1801,4.617554858934169
2042411,5,B0001XAOPM,"After many years, Neve Campbell has succeeded in realizing a dream to create a movie about the life of a ballet company, and her collaborative effort with Robert Altman turned out just fantastic.  It's not really a documentary, and not really a performance DVD, but ""The Company"" incorporates features of both, tying together many vignettes involving practice, performance, and the personal lives of dancers to create a great ballet watching experience.

Ms. Campbell, a trained ballet dancer starting at the age of 6, worked very hard to get herself ""ready for prime time"" (in many ways) as a member of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago corps.  Yes, it's the actual Joffrey company, and you get to see many cast members from numerous personal and performance perspectives.  Mr. Altman's directing features high definition film, plus viewing angles of dance routines that only a director of his caliber could imagine.  Artistic Director Gerald Arpino is incarnated into Alberto Antonelli, played by Malcolm McDowell, who is in great form and incorporates some of Mr. Arpino's mannerisms and commentary into the director's persona.  Aside from the credited actors, the Joffrey dancers are the true stars, and I found every aspect of the dance lifestyle to be fascinating.

The DVD extras are also excellent.  The commentary feature has both Mr. Altman and Ms. Campbell, so you get to learn about all that evolved to make this movie happen.  The extended dance scenes are great, and there's a feature where you can watch just the dance aspects of the film grouped together in one sequence.",1113091200,5,1583,5.081081081081081
2042412,5,B0001XAOPM,"Robert Altman's eloquent, alluring ""The Company"" is the kind of artsy film that leaves mainstream audiences somewhat nonplussed.  Its nonexistent storyline is, in fact, one of its greatest strengths if you are simply willing to be open to a film that does not fit the constraints of traditional cinema.  Altman's documentary-style direction shows us the whimsical world of ballet, a world utterly inaccessible to the majority of the population, as an emotional, meticulous art that yields breathtaking results.  We never learn much about the characters (Neve Campbell, Malcolm McDowell, and dancers of the actual Joffery Ballet of Chicago), yet this works in the film's favor as we are compelled to keep watching in hopes of learning a bit more about each of these fascinating people and exactly what compels them to sacrifice so much for their art.

Filmed with the complete cooperation of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago from a script based on a story cocreated by former dancer for the National Ballet of Canada, Neve Campbell (""Scream""), and Barbara Turner, the film's ""story"" is really just a backdrop to the stunning dance numbers and rehearsals, as well as snippets of the dancer's lives, shot in a documentary-esque style.  Therefore, it never falls prey to dance clichs or melodramatic moments as it has the good sense not to get in the way of the astonishing look the viewer has into what it takes to be such a dancer.  I cannot say the same for such films as ""Center Stage"", which was a painfully earnest and ultimately ridiculous attempt to show us the ""real world"" of dancers.

As stated by Altman upon completion of this masterpiece, ""The Company"" is a heartfelt Valentine to the dancers who dedicate their lives to ballet as well as to the elegant art itself.",1111104000,5,1772,4.926174496644295

I didn't know that she was a trained dancer in Canada until 15 years old, 8 years before she became famous with the international success of the Wes Craven horror.  So, it is only natural that she thinks of her own dream as the material for the film, for which she became a co-producer and even provided the story though the script was written by veteran writer and former actress (and mother of Jeniffer Jason Leigh), Barbara Turner ('Pollock' and many others).  And the original score is done by Van Dyke Parks.

But why 'directed by' Robert Altman?  Not that I hate his films, but that's the crutial point when watching 'The Company' because in this movie, like most of his previous films like 'Short Cuts,' you only have a minimal storyline in it.  Though Neve Campbell as one of the company's dancer 'Ry' is top-billed, with the supports like James Franco as a trainee chef who falls in lovw with her, and Malcom Mcdowell as 'Mister A' who runs 'The Company,' the real star of the film is, as many reviewers have rightly said, wonderful artists of The Joffrey Ballet Dancers, or the ballet campany itself.

So in the film you see many real professional dancers of that company, plus two real-life choreographers Lar Lubovitch and Robert Desrosiers.  With them the film has a semi-documentary touch whenever it shows the dancers on and off the stage (especially in the 'off' scenes).  You get a glimpse of the hard life of dancers whose ultimate joy is to dance on stage, not through the characters and the story, but through the bits of realistic descriptions of their rehearsals, injuries, and arguments.

But here is my question -- so why not make a documentary of the Joffrey Dancers themselves?  That is more interesting, isn't it?  Many reviewers praise the dance scenes of the film, which I think, is surely magnificient, but I was curiously unimpressed.  I don't know for sure, because I am not a fan of ballet.  But I am sure that if these hard-working dancers can show such beautiful things on stage -- and yes, they do, I know -- so, why Neve Campbell?  Why not other trained professional dancers, who deserve fame on screen?

Perhaps, the reason for my slightly unsatisfied feelings is this -- why Ms. Campbell as the star?  Sorry, fans, I liked her in 'Scream' no matter what she thought about the franchise, but I just could not see why she should be the 'star'?  And again, why Altman, whose films have been, you would agree, based on just one principle -- that of ensemble drama?  'The Company' certainly captures the psuedo-family atmosphere of the ballet dancers, and the director's slightly fly-on-the-wall look is always a tender and affectionate one, but with a different approach -- in this case, documentary, 'The Company' would have been much better, doing a great survice to these dancers.",1110326400,4,2956,4.715953307392996

Watching the company it like walking in on an event with the buzz of conversation, but having no idea what anyone is talking about or why they are there. I think it's interesting that this film was able to be produced, but it's simply not interesting to watch. At any time you think something interesting may happen, the scene ends and in the next you see people you've never seen before, only for that scene to end before you can really understand it. Similar to looking at a blurry photograph, you get an idea of what's suposed to be there, but you get no real substance; there is no evidence of a plot until after the first 45 minutes, and even then there is no real development, just a suggestion that things are in fact linear.

If you want to see a film about dance, there are better ones out there. If you want to see a film with a storyline of any kind, there are those as well. To me, this film is only valuable as an experiment, a failed experiement, in filmmaking.",1097452800,3,1230,4.366812227074236

2042419,3,B0001XAOPM,"The trailer for ""The Company"" is tantalizingly vague and compelling - flashes of dance and movement, hints of a ballerina's personal life (when we see Neve Campbell playing pool in a bar), the forceful projection of Malcolm McDowell as he instructs his troop, but no clear sense of what the film's story is about. And it turns out that the trailer is an accurate representation of the film. We see evocative imagery, brilliant dancing, and a forceful character presented by McDowell, but still leave without a clear sense of the story.

The film is presented as Robert Altman's film, and as director and co-producer it's a fitting appellation. But as star, co-writer, and co-producer, the film is as much Neve Campbell's as anyone's.

Initially I sat through the film feeling a bit frustrated by the incompleteness of the story. But as time passed before I was able to write this review, it was able to gestate a bit, and I ended up feeling that Robert Altman and Neve Campbell deliberately and in some ways brilliantly deliver exactly the film they wanted.

The stories presented in ""The Company"" are frustratingly abbreviated. We see Josh (James Franco) first spot Ry (Neve Campbell) in the restaurant where he works, though she does not see him. We later see them in a bar - he covertly watches her while she plays pool. We don't see them meet - instead, the film flashes forward to them waking up together. The next scene with him has him entering her apartment with his own key. Clearly, time has passed and we have only seen flashes of their lives together, without the opportunity to watch the characters develop.

Other subplots are similarly condensed. We see a new dancer (John Gluckman) fumbling about trying to find his place in the Company - pleading to share a locker with another dancer, struggling to find an open spot on the bar, begging to sleep on a fellow dancer's apartment floor. A quick glimpse into the impoverished life of a new dancer, but no clear development, nor a clear resolution for that matter. In another storyline, we see the interactions between a gorgeous young dancer (David Gombert) and his over-controlling boyfriend (Yasen Peyankov, who is listed as his mentor in the credits, but the relationship seems so much more), but we fail to receive a complete picture of their story.

But in a way, it seems that these abbreviated stories are in fact intentional, meant more like sporadic snapshots into their lives rather than a complete film reel. And in that sense, the film mirrors the art it features. Dance, and ballet in particular, invokes emotions through color, movement, and sound. The stories told in a ballet are hinted at, suggested by the dancers' actions. Similarly, the film hints at the characters' stories through quick images, but without presenting a complete story. The audience is given a few moments in time but is left to connect the dots and complete the story themselves - just as we would at a ballet.

And the film presents just enough hints to be able to fill in those blanks, or at least some of them. We see how hard it is for Ry and Josh to stay together. They are separated continuously throughout the movie - when he has to work on New Year's Eve, when he's later separated from her across a crowded bar, when he's already asleep when she returns home, and ultimately, when he's trapped on the opposite side of the stage from her at the film's conclusion. But though the theme of being separated recurs throughout, in the end it seems to be about being able to surmount those obstacles to stay together. Though Josh is already asleep when Ry returns home on New Year's Eve, she is able to snuggle against him on the couch and fall asleep in his arms. Though they are separated across the stage, he is able to sneak across during the curtain call to be with her.

Ultimately, the main ""character"" of the film is the ballet company itself. A large portion of the film covers the company's dance rehearsals and performances with minimal plot development involved, and it's fitting that the film concludes with a curtain call for the ballet troop. Once professional critic wisely noted that in the end, the film is Robert Altman's love poem to the Joffrey Ballet (evidenced by four different renditions of ""My Funny Valentine"" that play throughout the film). And ultimately, that may be all the film needs to be.",1095465600,5,4377,4.7362204724409445

The whole movie is just bad (except for the Joffrey dancing) no plot, no acting skills by any of the ""real"" actors, bad acting on the part of the ballet dancers ... but then they are dancers and not proclaiming to be actors. There's just no plot and it's hard to make sense of what is trying to be portrayed in this film. The only saving grace is watching the ballet pieces that don't involve Neve Campbell as the ""star"".

If I were rating this purely on the ballet scenes, it would have to be a five. But this is a movie, not a ballet, and it needed a story. I'm at a loss to discuss the film any further, and am surprised that others found more words to use than I have.",1093046400,7,605,4.45045045045045
2042422,4,B0001XAOPM,"I love ballet! I love good dance in general. So watching Robert Altman's ""The Company"" was 112 minutes of pure bliss. Altman takes us onstage, and off-stage, for a look at the world of dance, dancers, choreographers, set and costume designers and a ballet director, Alberto Antonelli, played wonderfully well by Malcolm McDowell. Actress Neve Campbell, best known for her roles in horror flicks, was trained for years in classical ballet. She is absolutely beautiful, and an extraordinarily lithe, exciting dancer. (No more scary movies Neve!!). It is obvious that she has put a lot of herself into this film. Not only does she play a major role, but she co-wrote and co-produced the movie. She did all of her own dancing, and seems to fit right in with the professional dancers from the Joffrey Ballet Troupe of Chicago, which is featured here.

The film is loosely structured and documentary-like. The viewer gets a fly on the wall look at a dancer's life as Altman takes us behind the scenes, up close and personal. We watch both the professional and personal - from the grueling physical toll of constant practice to brilliant performances. The dancers' effort to perfect their mastery of dance is totally honest, and this artistic honesty really makes the film as special as a live performance. There are some spectacular dance performances throughout, with splendid colors, electric energy, creative costumes, and wonderful footwork which showcase the Joffrey Ballet Company. There's an opening modern piece where dancers leap across the stage with streamers, that is just fabulous. In another sequence a ballerina dances on and around a swing. Altman's camera emphasizes her grace and elegance, and this is one of the movie's high points for me. Neve Cambell also dances a marvelous pas de deux onstage, during an outdoor concert performance, in the rain. The effects are incredible. The music is ""My Funny Valentine."" The last number, the piece de resistance, is more garish than grande, unfortunately. The costumes and choreography look as if they had been designed for Sesame Street. I still enjoyed it, however. Just wanted to be fair and balanced here.

Ballet director Antonelli, (McDowell), is a temperamental tyrant who meddles in every aspect of the ballet. But he is also charismatic, funny, and acknowledged as the troupe's backbone. Neve Campbell plays Ry, a member of the ensemble who is increasingly given important roles, as her talent merits. Her love interest, (James Franco), is a hunk! The chemistry between them is dynamite! We are also shown the tempermental behavior, tantrums, stress and strife that go on backstage.

There's no major story here, just enough to entice. The main attraction is fantastic dance. Highly recommended for aficionados and beginners alike.

2042423,4,B0001XAOPM,"Not quite a documentary, not convincing as fiction - what, exactly, is ""The Company"" intended to be? I enjoyed the movie, but after watching it, I still don't know the answer to that question.

The movie's sequence (you can't really call it a story) is primarily centered around a series of rehearsals and performances by Chicago's Joffrey Ballet company, in particular those of its star dancer, Ry (Neve Campbell - I'm guessing at the spelling of her character's name). The performances on and off stage are wonderful without exception, and the behind-the-scenes portions of the movie give us at least a taste of what's behind the beautiful dance steps and costumes.

Unfortunately, though, that's really all we get - a taste. We never get to know any of the dancers in any depth or see more than a very superficial view of what their art means to them. There is ostensibly a side story involving Campbell's character and her past and future boyfriends, but neither the story nor any of the characters are sufficiently developed to make that portion of the movie very interesting.

The delightfully stern and arrogant dance coach (Malcolm McDowell) is the only clearly developed character; the scenes involving him are amusing enough to be worth waiting for. But the real showstoppers are the dance recitals themselves, and the finale is well worth sitting through the good and mediocre scenes that precede it.",1091664000,2,1411,4.970338983050848

2042425,2,B0001XAOPM,"This film does have some amazing dance footage that's well worth the rental fee (possibly also worth the purchase price). However, the rest of the movie is at best too lightweight to be of any interest, and at worst pointless. The movie purports to show the blood, sweat, and tears involved in professional dance, but there's very little of any of this shown. The crises that do occur on-screen (e.g., serious injury) receive such little attention that they seem trivialized.

 The side-story about the dancer Ry (Neve Campbell) contributes almost nothing to the film. Her family life and personal relationships are one-dimensional, and it's impossible to develop any empathy. And this is one of the best-developed characters in the entire movie. One also wonders if Altman pulled his punches, since professional dance is physically, mentally, and emotionally much tougher than portrayed here.

 Having said that, the dance footage is terrific. Since dance is performed under very specific physical constraints (i.e., on a stage that's usually many feet away from the viewer), being able to see the choreography from normally inaccessible angles and distances provides a whole new perspective.

 In the end, it was incomprehensible why Altman would choose to combine a brilliant film of the Joffrey (I hesitate to say ""about"") with a completely useless storyline that says nothing about dancers and nothing about people. Those frames could have been put to much better use filming more dance. If you get the DVD, skip the movie and just play the dance sequences.

The only scene I found interesting was when the class was at barre. This movie has characters popping out of nowhere. For example, one totally new character shows up at an apartment because his aunt just died!! What does that mean??? Also, the company was rehearsing and all of a sudden we are expected to know who this Susan chick is!! way confusing!! There's no character development!

Also, if you are a ballet dancer who really appreciates classical ballets, then the performances in this DVD are no way as magical as say, Gisele. Everything is very modern, no storytelling really. The technique could be better.

Two local video stores I frequent have only one copy each. I found it entertaining; it is designed to take you backstage and show you the practice, work, and experience that goes into a ballet production. It is somewhat impressionistic and indeed somewhat plotless, though Neve Campbell does have a boyfriend and a mother who appear onscreen. Mr. Antonelli with his everpresent yellow scarf is an effective though somewhat imperious manager who motivates the company by constantly criticizing what he calls phony or pretty ballet, occasionally going over the edge with some dancers.
  The problem is, as an audience member I find ballet above all extraordinarily graceful. But the director must motivate his troops, and the point he makes is probably valid. Antonelli at one point wins an award from the Italian-American Heritage Society. I found it enjoyable to be caught up in the everyday lives of the dancers including a Christmas party and the practice routines and finished stage products which are on display often in the film, including 'The Blue Snake' at the end.

He is absolutely convincing.  I was fascinated watching the performances rehearsed and how they went from choosing the dancers to the final spectacle on the stage.

I get the impression this ballet company film was way scaled down from a bloated romantic script and consequently we're left with the bare bones of cliched situations and characters, who instead of executing their expectant behavior, manage to do nothing at all. I'm glad that the kid ballet guy with no place to sleep didn't end up hanging from a rope, and that the young star's choice of a common Romeo type over a dashing prancer didn't cause her starry-eyed Mother to rebel, but why ignite these flames at all just to see them die down to a warm but lifeless ember?

Rather, what Altman attempts to do is to convey a dancer's milieu--the physical pressures, the competitiveness, and the sheer joy of dancing.  The dancing sequences are spectacular--Altman appreciates and savors each of them, without doing any heavily MTV-esque editing.
If you like Robert Altman, odds are good you will enjoy this film, although it is lighter on character development than much of his other work.

I rented this film because, as I do respect dance as well as Altman's creative visions in past films, that it would at least open up my eyes to the world of dance in some way.

Plot is nearly non-existant, and the movie feels very long and slow, and you spend most of the movie feeling disengaged. It does show the chaotic world of the professional dancer. And while the movie appears to focus on the dancers as real individuals, it does it in such a crafty way that you eventually realize that they simply interchangable and dispensible, both to the artistic director and the art itself.

Maybe it can best be described as a series of slightly fictionalized vignettes that follows a few months in a real-world ballet company. Despite the lack of plot, high drama, character development, or other things we usually expect from movies, The Company never fails to be fascinating in its portrayal of the lives of the dancers and the inner-workings of their profession.
The filmmaker's restrained approach gave the movie a sense of realness absent in conventional dramas, yet doesn't dilute it's power. After all, the events depicted really happened, and the dancers on screen are dancers in real life. The movie makes its points with small, finely-observed moments that says much.  For example, when a star dancer snap her Achilles Tendon, she was quickly replaced.  As she was carried off stage it seemed that's the last we will see of her since that injury effectively ends her career.  But later at a public performance we see her limping to the side of the stage to watch her replacement dancing in her role.
The reasons for these people's tremendous dedication were never explicitly articulated in the movie.  Some find this as a lack of depth.  But I feel words are not necessary, nor adequate, to illustrate it.  Simply take a look at the power and the grace the dancers display on stage, one would understand their passion and sacrifice.
As a bonus, the DVD has a worthwhile commentary track, in which Altman and Campell discuss the the actual Joffrey company and its dancers in relation to the movie. Interesting and informative.",1087603200,5,1648,4.924187725631769
2042436,5,B0001XAOPM,"Directed by Robert Altman, this film is about a year in the life of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, which is the true star of the film.  It also stars Neve Campbell, who  wrote and produced it as well, and it was surely an act of love on her part.  Even though she was originally trained as a dancer, she still had to train for three months, seven hours a day before even beginning to train with the company, which took another few months before shooting began. She is a wonderful dancer and The Company brings this all out.

This is not a film about one person though.  And it is not a film with lots of interlocking stories.  Basically, it is a film about the creative process itself, and how an idea gets turned into an elaborate work of art.  It's hard to get the feel of this onto the screen. But Mr. Altman is a master in making sure it all come together.

It takes more than hard work to be a member of the company.  It takes talent, dedication and pain and there are a few shots of the dancers' feet that made my own corns and calluses seem like nothing.  Malcolm McDowell is cast as the artistic director and he is terrific.  He's eccentric and moody and wonderfully creative as he has an intuitive understanding of how a new ballet will all come together in performance.  Most of the dancing shows the new and experimental although there is no doubt that the company is classically trained.

There are a few small stories, but all of them just add to understanding of the company as a whole.  For example, there is a romance between Neve Campbell and James Franco, cast as a young chef.  This story is basically used to underscore the demanding life of the ballerina, which forces her to also work as a waitress in order to support herself.  Then there is a poignant scene where a dancer snaps an Achilles tendon during rehearsal.  Everyone knows that this means she will never dance again.  But the show must go on.  During the Grande Finale performance itself, one of the dancers is injured and another dancer takes her place in such a way that the performance seems seamless.

All the dancing bore the touch of Robert Desrosiers and Lar Lubovitich, two master choreographers who also had roles in the film. I must also give a standing ovation to the cinematographers who shot this film with multiple cameras and high definition video.  I know I love watching dancers on the stage.  But the kind of angles and close-ups that are possible in film transform the experience of watching dance into an almost participatory experience.

There are good extras on the DVD, including interviews and some extended dance performances.  I just couldn't stop watching and absorbing all the backstage lore.

2042437,3,B0001XAOPM,"No, despite the fact that ""The Company"" is even more lacking in narrative structure than the usual Altman film, I was never bored. I'm not a fan of ballet, but even I was thrilled by the performances in this film and moved by the beauty of dance. What Altman has done here is use one art form to record the artistic process of another, and it's mostly successful on those terms.
I have to admit that my attention did wander at times. I didn't want a contrived plot and was happy just watching artists at work, but even I was craving some dramatic conflict here and there. I have to think there's more drama in the behind-the-scenes world of professional dance (just as there is when any group of people come together in a community) than Altman finds here. But the visuals are superb, especially the cinematography. And, being from Chicago myself, it was fun to soak in the Windy City locations (I could have been an extra in the outdoor scene they filmed in Grant Park, but wasn't able to go to the shoot).
There's really no need to mention the actors, since none of them really registers, with the exception of Malcolm McDowell, who breezes on and off the screen wearing a yellow scarf around his neck and barking tyrannical orders to have furniture moved out of his way.  No, the star of this show is the dance itself. It's not one of Altman's best films, but he's certainly done much, much worse.

2042438,5,B0001XAOPM,"As a dancer, I very much appreciated this film, which I found candid and realistic. The personal lives of the dancers remained shrouded in mystery, a daring and artistic move, I think. It didn't try to stir up sympathy or shock people with the fierceness of the ballet world. The star of the movie did not end up as the star of the company, and I was okay with that. There was just enough of her romance with Josh to satisfy me, and none of the soap opera-esque drama that ruined Center Stage. This film is an absolute gem!",1087171200,7,523,4.292929292929293
2042439,3,B0001XAOPM,"I knew when I ordered this movie that it might be a long shot in terms of me enjoying it.  However, it at least seemed like it would be interesting, and according to that criteria, it met my expectations.  I think that the viewer's expectations are going to be the key criteria in deciding whether or not to rent this movie and will greatly impact his or her enjoyment of it.  If the viewer just wants to watch some modern dancing, then I think they will be satisfied.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the dancing both in terms of choreography and the execution of it. Even Neve Campbell, who use to be a ballet dancer by the way, did a good job. If the viewer is expecting a scripted story with lots of dialogue about the trials and tribulations of being a dancer with a few dance scenes thrown in for good meaure, then the viewer will probably be disappointed. This is not the typical dance movie that has come out in the last few years. For some viewers what might detract from their enjoyment is the plot, or what some reviewers say is a lack thereof. Also, the sound is bad during the dialogue. However, I think that Altman's goal was not to do the standard plot where there is lots of dialogue talking about being a dancer, but not much footage really showing it.  I think it was his goal to show the viewer, not tell the viewer, what it means to be a dancer. The movie is presented in a stream of consciousness type format. Although he may have presented more information visually than directors of other dance movies, it seems to me that because dancing is mostly a visual media, this may be a good way to go. In the movie we may see just a little slice of time, but I think I gained a better understanding, both from the perspective as an outsider and from a more intimate view thanks to what was shown to me, than I have watching any of the other movies about dancers that I have seen recently. Another reason some people may not like the movie is that at the end everything was not wrapped up in a nice bow. I may not know when the movie started or when it finished, or what will happen next, but I know I had a good time on the journey.",1086998400,5,2141,4.237745098039215
2042440,5,B0001XAOPM,"I enjoyed this movie more than I had expected to given the reviews I've read.  I think one has to love dance more than the average movie-goer does in order to enjoy The Company.
The dancing is wonderful.  It is modern in the way it is choreographed and balletic in the way it is danced.  And both the choreography and dancing are the very best.  As a former member of the Los Angles Ballet Company I can say there is a lot of realism in the depiction of the life of the dancers.
I agree that there is not much plot in The Company; but really, aren't we all tired of the overdone young-dancer-gets-a-break-and-becomes-a-star storyline?  The Company doesn't need plot because it is not a story; it is a portrait of a way of life.  Looked at like that, it is a wonderful movie.",1086393600,7,774,4.340277777777778
2042441,5,B0001XAOPM,"THE COMPANY is a bit difficult to categorize as a movie, that is unless you are familiar with Robert Altman's unique form of cinematic technique.  There are fragments of storylines and a behind the scenes, very private views of what makes a Ballet Company function, but that is about it. And that is enough.  Altman knows how to stay out of the way as a director: the film feels extemporaneous.  Briefly, THE COMPANY is the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago during a season.  The cast is dominated by the company members who act with casual lyricism, dance with extraordinary grace and technique, and share their moments of joy, pain, frustration, stage fright, and physical stamina with us as though we were a fly on the wall.  Neve Campbell is responsible for bringing this film to the screen, sharing the producing and writing responsibilities as well as re-entering her past training as a ballerina to dance all her own roles -cast as a company dancer rising to premiere danseuse roles when another dancer is injured.  Malcolm McDowell ties the film together as a version of director Gerald Arpino.  But the focus here is on preparation of the company by choreographers from initial discussion of concept to full dress performance of many ballets.  In the case of Lar Lubovitch, the choreography is exquisite: the pas de deux 'My Funny Valentine' danced by Campbell and partner Domingo Rubio is the best part of the film.  The expensive production of an absurdly bad ballet by Robert Desrosiers is at the other end of the spectrum.  The filming is gently beautiful, the dancing at the bar and on the stage is peerless, and the overall feeling of camaraderie and commitment that exists in the sheltered world of ballet is sensitively portrayed.  When it comes to simple observation of life, few do it better than Altman, and THE COMPANY is no exception.  A fine little docudrama.",1086393600,4,1874,4.84012539184953
2042442,4,B0001XAOPM,"In ""The Company"", Robert Altman applies his pseudo-documentary directing style to The Joffrey Ballet of Chicago. In a style that reminds me very much of Altman's acclaimed 1975 film ""Nashville"", ""The Company"" gives us an intimate view of a year in the life of The Joffrey Ballet. Screenwriter Barbara Turner spent a few years getting to know the Joffrey's dancers and recording their stories, which she then transformed into a screenplay for ""The Company"". Actress Neve Campbell, who was a dancer with the National Ballet of Canada before going to Hollywood, co-produces, acts and dances in the film. ""The Company"" has an ensemble cast, with a subtle concentration on the life of Neve Campbell's character, Ry. Six days a week of training and rehearsals leaves Ry little time for a personal life, but she struggles to make time for her boyfriend (James Franco) and a second job at a Goth bar while she eats, sleeps, and breathes dance. Malcolm McDowell plays the company's artistic director, Alberto Antonelli, a role inspired by the Joffrey's real Artistic Director, Gerald Arpino. The dancers are all played, quite convincingly, by The Joffrey Ballet's dancers.

I really enjoyed ""The Company"", but you probably either have to really like Robert Altman's work or really like dance to like this film. To say the story arch is unpronounced  would be an understatement. The story is the dedication and talent of these dancers. Nothing unusual happens. We simply observe them. I gather that that's the point. The dancers' performances and commitment are extraordinary. Emotions are high; good and bad things happen; but that's ordinary in the life of a professional ballet dancer. ""The Company"" 's pace is thoroughly even, and its tone is subdued. I thought at first that watching this film was going to require patience, as so many of Altman's film's do. But I was quickly sucked in by the opportunity to see inside the ballet subculture, along with some incredible dancing.

There is a lot of footage of The Joffrey Ballet's performances. All of them are modern, not classical. And we can see even more of the dancers in their movie roles, to which they take quite naturally. Neve Campbell trained for months and became a temporary member of The Joffrey to make this film. She appears in eight dances in the film, although you may not be able to pick her out in all of them. ""The Company"" is her tribute to the world of dance that she loves, and it turns out to be a perfect subject for Robert Altman's signature directing style. If Altman's signature style makes you groan, you may still like ""The Company"", as it's broken up with fantastic performances by The Joffrey Ballet.

The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by director Robert Altman and Neve Campbell, a  making-of featurette, ""The Passion of Dance"" featurette, an ""Extended Dance Sequence"", and the ability to play all of the dance sequences from the film. The audio commentary is really pretty interesting. I found myself listening to more of it than I had intended. Robert Altman and Neve Campbell discuss the film's genesis, its style, their experiences filming and interacting with The Joffrey. It includes a lot of information about the dancing in the film and more insight into the Joffrey and the world of ballet. The ""Making of Featurette"" is a 7-minute documentary that features interviews with Altman, Campbell, Malcolm McDowell, and James Franco. In ""The Passion of Dance"" (4 minutes), Neve Campbell talks about the demanding world of professional ballet and her desire to make a film about it. The ""Extended Dance Sequence"" is a 2-minute dance sequence that takes place in the film's dance studio. It's not very interesting. I recommend the audio commentary, even if you don't have time to listen to the whole thing.",1086393600,7,3803,4.954545454545454

Not a dancer myself, I enjoy the vicarious pleasure of ""behind-the-scenes"" movies, and Altman's directorial technique and the general plotlessness gave The Company an immersive, true-to-life feel.

This includes glimpses on what life is like and the sacrifices that a dancer must make to achieve her goals.  Highlights from the film include Ms Campbell's sultry, but clean, dance in the rain and the Snake Dance.  The film is artsy and may not be appreciated by those who like a strong movie plot.  But it is a wonderful book of memories from a year in the life of a beautiful dancer.  I have only seen the movie and look forward to purchasing the DVD.",1081900800,13,699,4.37984496124031
2042446,5,B0001XAOPM,"Robert Altman tries to give us a human vision of a ballet company in Chicago. The first great quality of this film is the dancing itself. A magical world of visual emotions that bring together the feeling that dancers are like birds that try to fly off the ground and conquer the world on one hand, and the beauty of colors and movements that engulf our imagination in a voyage into what can emerge from a maelstrom of recollections and contorsions coming from the deepest and highest strata of our love for the unknown on the other hand. But the film goes beyond this marvelous experience. It reveals the intense cruelty of this profession. The cruelty of a profession that is so short-lived that it is nearly finished before ever starting, the cruelty of an art that demands the impossible from dancers who may be unable to go over the frontier that bounds their fears and their hopes. The fear of aging. The fear of becoming stiff. The fear of falling and hurting their limbs. The fear of engulfing themselves in some deep emotional relation that may lead to an awful disease and death. The fear of displeasing the maestro that commands them. And yet the hope to become so light that the earth may retract and let them fly over the stage. The hope that they will be best and they will know the thrilling experience of a clapping and applauding audience. The hope that the world may be only an emotional trip into love and pleasure. The hope that they will be eternally young and beautiful. And Robert Altman sprinkles his film with the hard moments of reality that darken the beauty of this dancing sky. A fall that hurts or breaks a limb meaning the end of the adventure. A desire that is negated by the maestro, the choreographer, the director and the frustration that will come along with this negation, a frustration that knows no appeal. You can satisfy the tyrant that governs your work or you can't. And if you can't you have to leave, no matter whether you have become too old and have not seen it coming, or you have not been able to ply your limbs into the movement that is required. There is always someone in the wings that is prepared and waiting to take over at any time because the show must go on and you are nothing but a screw in a complex machine, and the screw you are can always be replaced. The only hope you may have, if you are a girl, is to love someone from outside this magic world who will be able to lift you up and take you to a second life. The only hope, if you are a boy, is not specified in the film. Dancing is a lot crueller for boys than it is for girls. So few will be able to become choreographers or directors. So many will have to go along their own ways into some uninteresting and dull feeding jobs somewhere outside. And the audience will not even see you or recognize you, except if you become a star, and the sky of the ballet has so few stars that are shooting stars anyway. And all that cruelty is wrapped up in some golden paper that justifies the chiefs of the tribe who can say they are humane, friendly, loving, though it is only an attitude, a language, a hypocritical stance covering the intense heartlessness of this world. A world of intense hopes, short thrills, constant fears and long frustrations. And no one will care when you are finished.

2042448,3,B0001XAOPM,"THE COMPANY is not of Robert Altman's best films. Like so much of his work, (THE PLAYER, MASH) it takes place inside a particular subculture with its own set of rules. In this case it's the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago. THE COMPANY is the story of a season in the life of a ballet company, from the opening night parties to behind the scenes squabbling.
  Ry (the beautiful Neve Campbell) is a second tier dancer who gets a chance to star when another dancer is injured. She becomes a favorite of the company director (Malcolm McDowell) and dances in a number of other roles. Along the way she falls in love with a handsome chef (James Franco).
  That's about as much story as there is, although there are a number of other plotlines involving the other dancers (all of whom play themselves) that are started and then dropped. What THE COMPANY is really about is what goes on behind the scenes in the dancers lives. Bad relationships, injuries, personality conflicts, issues with the director (McDowell preens brilliantly and provides all the film's humor) , etc. There are also ballets, presented both in performance and in rehearsal, and THE COMPANY is also a celebration of the art and athleticism of these dancers.
  Don't go see THE COMPANY expecting a happy ending, or any ending. Robert Altman, as always, is interested in the weird interactions of human behavior. THE COMPANY is a unique and worthy film. Recommended.",1079568000,23,1422,4.783673469387755
2042449,4,B0001XAOPM,"I really don't like the ballet. I guess you can lump me in with the majority of the male population in that respect - I think it's tedious, and it just doesn't seem to hold my interest. Not to mention those leotards - I have my own package to look at, thank you. But tonight, as I sat down in a little, cramped theater to see Robert Altman's follow-up to his smash critical hit, Gosford Park (he nabbed a Director nom for it in 2001), I realized a really scary thing - the ballet scenes in Altman's free-flowing, gorgeous Company are REALLY COOL. That's right; not just in a visual sense (props to Andrew Dunn, the cinematographer, though), but in the fact that the enthusiasm and blood/sweat/tears that go into the art really leap of the screen in this movie.
  The film opens just like a performance - audience noise, a booming voice introducing the dancers - and then Chicago's Joffrey Ballet bursts into action, strips of fabric and bodies moving across the stage to Van Dyke Parks' pulsing score. Then effortlessly, casually, Altman moves on to a normal day in the lives of the Joffrey dancers and The Company begins its steady pace that never lets up.
  I guess it's somewhat of a sin to, as a movie critic, not have seen too many Robert Altman movies, but what I've seen (Nashville (flat-out one of the best movies I've ever seen) and Gosford Park (a highlight of 2001)) has been great, and The Company seems to fall in that same general style for which the man is legendary. The camera wanders around and characters move in and out of the story, and the movie is held together by stunning ballet sequences that feature (what I'm told to be) the Joffrey ballet's best numbers.
  Then again, Altman is also known for not having 'plot' as a primary goal in his movies, and where it works all the time in Nashville, it is at once the movie's greatest strength and weakness here. To play the plot summary game for this one would be futile, for there's not much: Neve Campbell is Ry, a star dancer for the Joffrey, and at one point she gets a boyfriend (James Franco, curiously underused here), their schedules clash, and more ballet drama goes on. We meet a few other characters, but more often-than-not, they're just faces of the ballet. Sometimes, people appear in the beginning of the film and...well, we simply don't see any more of them. I guess Altman was trying to show the organic, unfolding nature of the film, but a couple of times I suffered from cinematic blue balls.  BUT, I think the proof that the loosey-goosey structure of the movie works is found in a great ""Christmas roast"" scene where the ballet assembles to parody aspects of their troupe. At this point, I knew I was locked in to The Company, for I found myself laughing my ass off - and if you're getting those inside jokes, the movie's been working.
  The movie's power lies in those ballet scenes (that must comprise at least a third of the film) that simply exist on screen, for us to observe like an in-house audience. One performance in particular had the somewhat restless audience in the movie theater so speechless and still, I swear I could hear people exhaling when it was over. And then Neve's great moment, which occurs near the beginning of the film - a lush, erotic ballet in an outdoor ampitheater that continues at the performers' unsaid insistence during a violent windstorm that begins pouring rain. Malcolm McDowell, who plays the director of the Ballet, begins ranting and worrying that someone might slip - and whether it happens or not, well, you'll have to see for yourself. Altman builds tension that could rival any psychological thriller, and even has the winking capacity to surprise us. And he surprised me, too, for the film's sudden ending left we wanting more. That's saying a lot for a guy who hates the ballet. GRADE: B+",1078963200,4,3830,4.604105571847508
2042450,3,B0001XAOPM,"You go into 'The Company' knowing that it's a Robert Altman film - so you expect all things Altman: more slice-o-life than contrived plot; lots of simultaneous events (and speaking) going on; inventive camera work.  Altman excels at getting into the inner workings of things.  In 'The Company,' if you like ballet - or even if you wonder in general how large creative performances fall into place - this movie will be of great interest to you.
Not to say it's a great movie.  Malcolm McDowell is the only one here really given a chance to act, and he's excellent.  His dominant personality makes him the beacon of the film.  All action seems drawn to him.
By contrast, Neve Campbell had her hands full with producing and dancing (she's a very good dancer).  Although she is the nominal 'star' of the film, she doesn't have more than a handful of understated lines throughout.  Just to give you an idea what this film is like:  James Franco - tipped by some as this generation's James Dean - is cast as Neve's one-night-stand-turned-boyfriend.  The guy's a serious dramatic actor and beyond making eggs and preparing some other dishes (he is cast as a chef), I can't recall him uttering a single full line of dialogue.
All in all though, this is a good movie - not up there with Altman classics like 'The Player' (geting even better with time), but certainly several levels up from Altman stinkeroos like the Richard Gere/Farrah Fawcett fiasco 'Dr. T and The Women.'",1078185600,3,1465,4.69140625

There's very little talking and very, very little character development, purposely, sadly. (You know as much about the characters here as you know about the people performing in a ballet play.) The Company is really a silent film with a few droplets of dialogue -- a joke if you ask me. Unfortunately, I was never engaged by the performances (the first one came close, though).

2042454,3,B0001XAOPM,"I have a love/hate relationship with director Robert Altman's films.  I loved The Player, a viciously funny insider's look at the business of Hollywood, but I hated last year's Gosford Park, which I felt was a muddled mess of a film, without plot or coherence (and in which it was even difficult to figure out what the characters were saying).  Surprisingly to myself, I give The Company a middle-of-the-road overall rating:  the dancing is great, but the rest of the film is nothing special.
If you are a ballet fan, or even mildly interested in seeing some top-notch ballet, then The Company is recommended.  Nearly half the film shows dancing, both in rehearsal and in performance.  The filmed performances provide a perspective that you cannot get by watching ballet from an auditorium seat, since the camera is able to roam up close to and among the dancers.  The effect at times is quite magical and mesmerizing.
However, the storyline is nothing new or insightful.  Yes, there is a major contrast between the lives the ballet dancers live on stage, when they are realizing their dreams, and the rote, menial day jobs they take to put food on the table (didn't Flashdance cover this same ground?).  Another major focus of the film is the head of the ballet company, played by Malcolm McDowell (who's somewhat miscast, as his English accent comes through when he's supposed to be portraying an Italian-American).  We get to see the creative process at work in many scenes with McDowell interacting with other members of the company, but ground, too, has been trod many times before (contrast this with the film Adaptation, which showed a truly unique and fresh look at the challenge of creating art).
Neve Campbell does a very credible job in her role as one of the better up-and-coming ballerinas in the company.  Her dancing was very expressive, and while I wasn't checking to see if she was able to go ""en pointe"" like the professionals (her dances probably were carefully edited), it all came across in the final product as very seamless.",1076284800,,2047,4.839541547277937
2042455,4,B0001XAOPM,"Not quite a documentary, not convincing as fiction - what, exactly, is ""The Company"" intended to be?  I enjoyed the movie, but after watching it, I still don't know the answer to that question.
The movie's sequence (you can't really call it a story) is primarily centered around a series of rehearsals and performances by Chicago's Joffrey Ballet company, in particular those of its star dancer, Ry (Neve Campbell - I'm guessing at the spelling of her character's name).  The performances on and off stage are wonderful without exception, and the behind-the-scenes portions of the movie give us at least a taste of what's behind the beautiful dance steps and costumes.
Unfortunately, though, that's really all we get - a taste.  We never get to know any of the dancers in any depth or see more than a very superficial view of what their art means to them.  There is ostensibly a side story involving Campbell's character and her past and future boyfriends, but neither the story nor any of the characters are sufficiently developed to make that portion of the movie very interesting.
The delightfully stern and arrogant dance coach (Malcolm McDowell) is the only clearly developed character; the scenes involving him are amusing enough to be worth waiting for.  But the real showstoppers are the dance recitals themselves, and the finale is well worth sitting through the good and mediocre scenes that precede it.",1076112000,8,1413,4.970338983050848
2042456,4,B0001XAOPM,"The ballet: A centuries-old art of expressionism created though various means of physical movements and intellectual stimulation as a form of dance. It is also a form of recreation, where art often imitates life, and vice versa. At the prestigious Joffrey Institute in Chicago, ballet is seen as more than just an art form viewed through life. It is a way to communicate to the soul, and this art speaks to this very inner sanctimonium of the soul in more ways than one, as Antonio Antonelli (Malcolm McDowell), tries to reach his students through unorthodox methods, as well as ""force-feeding"" his energetic young charges to think outside the box. Getting his students to accept his stern and rudimentary ways of instruction is going to take an eternity, as this young troupe has a mind of their own. Spending much of their time carousing and partying is their idea of ""instruction"", so it seems, but, as the old adage goes, ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"", for a little R & R (including a good dose of TLC) in combination with a hefty amount of genuine elbow grease, is bound to make this particular Joffrey troupe stand head and shoulders above the competition (including the Windy City's very own Sears Tower). The cast of ""The Company"" rises to the occasion as well, including stellar performances from Neve Campbell, as well as Malcolm McDowell, and others. For performing arts theatrics at its finest, nothing beats a production of ""The Nutcracker"" or of ""Swan Lake"", for that matter. Move over guys, 'cause there's a new ballet in town.

2042457,3,B0001XAOPM,"I know other people have complained that the plot of this movie was light, but it was a little more than light.  In the middle of the third or fourth beautifully filmed dance scene, I wondered why they hadn't just gone and made a documentary, since the most tedious parts of the movie - Neve Campbell being followed by the beautiful chef who becomes her boyfriend - were the ones that wouldn't have been caught in a documentary.
Everything else about this movie that was interesting - the dynamic between choreographer and dancer, the strained living conditions of the dancers, the brutally competitive environment and general physical strain of dancing - could easily have come across in a documentary about the Joffrey ballet.  And we wouldn't get the occasionally stilted acting from the ballet dancers, or the feeling that the atmosphere of this movie is just right but the narrative details are a bit phony.
Altman movies have traditionally had a documentary feel about them, like the camera just walked into a group of characters and started filming, but the screenplays are always deeply involved with the stories of the people, and there are always a number of narrative arcs that proceed from beginning to end in some satisfying way.  Here we have nothing - just something about Campbell's boyfriend cheating on her, and then her finding someone else.  You can convey the rambling, episodic quality in a dancer's life, I think, while still having some of the satisfactions that a story provides.  Here they've just decided to barely bother with the second one.  Wisps of fascinating stories appear here and there - the well-connected young dancer constantly pressing Antonelli for an assignment, for example - but not enough time is spent to make any of it engaging, and they finally seem thrown in just to make this seem like a narrative movie instead of what it is, a documentary with some halfhearted flourishes.
I'm a huge fan of Altman - with the number of great movies he's made, I think he's joining a pantheon of American directors that includes John Ford and not many others - but this strikes me very worth seeing but disappointing as a film.",1075075200,,2161,4.842818428184282

8017814,3,B0001XAOPM,"This one's cold and disconnected, even moreso than usual for Altman. None of the characters really have any development or do much to make us care about them. Plus, the dialogue feels 90% adlibbed - and not in a good way.

Still, it gets points for the lovely dancing. Neve Campbell looks fantastic with her strong legs and shoulders - even if her character is totally empty. And I like the glimpses of the artistic process. But that's all they are: glimpses. We never get a clear sense of what's required to create a ballet from scratch, cast and rehearse it, and finally perform it.

A teenybopper pic like Center Stage does more to make us care about its characters while showing beautiful dancing and backstage action than this film does. In fact, I am going to rewatch that one soon.",1453852800,,788,4.581560283687943

8017817,5,B0001XAOPM,"Very professionally done and it moves along nicely;  I felt no lulls, or boring moments.  It's an insightful look into the life of a ballet company as well as the lives of some of its members all woven together.  The actors, actresses and dancers are professional in every way.  Neve Campbell is excellent and I wish that I could see more of her in movies today.  She has a way of making dancing, acting, just the ""art"" of living and relating seem effortless.",1435363200,2,459,4.481927710843373
