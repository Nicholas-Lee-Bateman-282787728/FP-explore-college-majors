2805436,3,B000OYCMM6,"This story has an interesting premise. A rather eccentric African-American psychologist moves into a typical American suburb and immediately arouses the suspicions of the old-guard residents there. As these residents start to peer and pry into the psychologist's life, they begin to suspect him of terrible crimes. However at the same time, each of the nosy residents is engaging in some soul-destroying behavior within the privacy of his own home.

The viewer is kept guessing. Is the psychologist really a wife-killer? Or is he simply making the other residents involuntary participants in some unconventional course of psychiatric treatment? Is the psychologist holding a mirror up to the other suburbanites hoping to make them aware of their own crimes?

This would be a really original, absorbing drama. However, it loses its way a little. There is a distracting subplot involving adoption. And the movie's end drags on too long with tiers of explanation. Also, the unfolding of the whole storyline is somewhat muddied with a bit too much quirkiness and occasional illogic.

But this is still a very worthwhile DVD. With a little rewriting, its idea could have been a challenging, award-winning movie.",1192233600,8,1206,5.270833333333333
2805437,1,B000OYCMM6,"At the end of this awful movie I was begging for the two hours back. Figured out the hidden meanings and plot in about 15 seconds. A real stink of a movie. The investers in this must still be hoping to recoup their $18!
