She always encourages you to work just a little harder, but NEVER to put yourself at risk for an injury or discomfort.  Back when I was taking her classes, I didn't experience the typical ""next day soreness"" that can happen.  Beginners and Seniors can both benefit greatly from her instruction.",1395100800,,387,4.746268656716418
8367585,5,B002EDD012,"I bought this dvd...and I love it.  Osha gives very clear instructions that make it easy for each person to do his or her very best...whatever level that is.  The segments are very well organized and provide for a great yoga practice...a little bit of everything but not overwhelming.  Osha is encouraging, challenging and supportive in a way that helps me to be ready to use the dvd again the next day.",1266278400,3,403,4.569444444444445

8367587,5,B002EDD012,"This DVD encourages you to relax and let go of your day so you can enjoy the present moment of practicing yoga. With Osha's calm voice, beautiful background music and a peaceful setting you are able to follow along easily. This DVD can be gentle or challenging depending on your own level, Osha directs you into the poses and then gives you the power and permission to do what feels right for you. That's what is so great about You Can Do It Yoga with Osha Ray.",1250640000,2,461,4.310344827586207
8367588,5,B002EDD012,"This video has a great teacher, great music, and a great setting. I agree with a prior reviewer that Osha is very non-intimidating.  In fact, in the video she encourages me with her message of self-empowerment so well that I actually have confidence despite being a middle age male with no regular yoga practice.",1249603200,2,312,4.777777777777778
8367589,5,B002EDD012,"I have been doing yoga for over 10 years and have seen many videos. I like this video because of the way it is organized and Osha's relaxing and easy-going attitude. The video is seperated into four parts: intro, floor, standing, and meditation. It is a long video in its entirety, but you can choose to do whatever sections you have time for since Osha does a short centering segment at the beginning of floor and standing sections. I really enjoyed the meditation segment. I think this is a great video for the experienced yoga practitioner and those new to the practice. My step-mother liked the video so much that I gave her my copy and I will be buying a new one!
