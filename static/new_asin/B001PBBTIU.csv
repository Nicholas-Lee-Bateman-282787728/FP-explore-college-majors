8332927,5,B001PBBTIU,"One of the best live shows that I've seen. Contains all ""The Poison"" album in live version, which is probably (in my opinion) the best metalcore album in the world. My favourites from here are ""Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow"", ""The Poison"", ""Tears Don't Fall"" and, of course, ""Hand of Blood"". Backstage footage and videos can be not so interesting (only for fans), but they successfully adding this amazing live show. Must-have for all the metalheads.",1391126400,,454,4.9868421052631575
8332928,5,B001PBBTIU,"This DVD flippin rocks...if played on the computer. Tried playing it in the Playstation which reads ""Video in the PAL broadcast is not supported"". The DVD will have to be re-formatted. Darn!!",1336521600,,191,5.0
8332929,5,B001PBBTIU,"If you like Bullet For My Valentine, you'll love this live show filmed in London at the Brixton Academy. It's live, loud, and killer! These dudes know how to sing, shred and put on an energetic show, plus they seem like cool regular dudes. Bonus features include all of the bands videos to date as well as some short interviews, bits and pieces of the band doing various ""band things"" as well as meeting with fans or filming their videos. Also, includes shorts with the band called ""Bullet TV"". Must own if you like B.F.M.V.!!",1165017600,,526,4.5473684210526315
