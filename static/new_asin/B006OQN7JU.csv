8502119,5,B006OQN7JU,the explanations were very clear and easy to follow. I recommend it for everyone who wants to learn advance tap dancing.,1381708800,,120,4.761904761904762
8502120,5,B006OQN7JU,"I really love this dvd!  It is shot well and Eli always gives great directions and tips.  I have all the whole TDME collection of dvds and video podcasts.  They have really helped me work on my technique and rhythm.  This is a great addition for any student who really wants to have some great tap steps to work on at home.  This is a good solid advanced level dvd, so have your wings, pullbacks, and pick-ups (grace taps) down well.  I have other dvds from other tap instructors that are at the advanced level, and this is at the same level.  Even if you are at an intermediate level, it would be an asset to own this dvd so you know to expect to get to the advanced level.",1357171200,3,674,4.138461538461539
8502121,5,B006OQN7JU,easy to follow clear instructions. I have all videos and they help me keep up with my tap class when I can't make it.,1355270400,4,117,3.9166666666666665
