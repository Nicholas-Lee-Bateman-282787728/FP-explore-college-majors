4659952,2,B005DJ62NM,"When someone gets the idea to take a TV show and turn it into a movie, the results aren't always good and that is what this DVD feels like.  Let's take the Osbourne's reality show, expand it to two hours and the end result is quite boring.  I really wanted to like God Bless Ozzy Osbourne but it was like beating a dead horse. Whether you are a fan or not, we have all heard Ozzy's story before and other documentaries like the VH1 Behind The Music and the recent 30 Years After The Blizzard tell it so much better than this DVD.  There are a few instances of cool rare video and film footage but all the other archive footage has been seen before.  I also get the feeling the producers wanted to use the stellar Rush documentary ""Beyond The Lighted Stage"" as a template and then surpass it.  But they didn't and the results are embarrassingly dull!

What I would rather have instead is an honest to goodness Black Sabbath DVD (similar to the Led Zeppelin DVD or even the KISSOLOGY series) that has the complete Paris concert from 1970 as well as the complete California Jam concert from 1974.  It could also include various TV appearances like Top Of The Pops from 1978 and the Midnight Special appearance from 1975.

I would recommend Tony Iommi's book as an alternative to this DVD because at least his memories of Black Sabbath are a lot more lucid than Ozzy's memory and I don't feel that is a glib statement.  While Ozzy is an icon, I do get tired of hearing about the hazy and overexposed ""drink and drugs"" excuses which seemed to be every 3rd or 4th line of the documentary.  There is nothing new here at all.",1321833600,5,1617,4.377926421404682
4659953,1,B005DJ62NM,"..Not to praise the enormous contributions of Lee Kerslake and Don Airey.. Along with a flat out RAPING of the one and only Jake E. Lee's un-mistakable additions to Bark At The Moon and Ultimate Sin- let alone, the 1st full time guitar player taking over for the late Randy Rhoads is a sincere crime. Let us not forget, this is indeed the same cash crab lot of fools who erased the original bass/drum tracks of the 1st 2 solo records, and Ozzy himself didn't have knowledge?? If not for the internet did others learn of this crime on the music/fan public. Extremely Easy to discard this junk being perpetrated on the un-knowingly music buying public. Shame on you Ozzy, Sharon and all involved for a very shallow doc.",1321315200,9,717,4.565891472868217

4659955,3,B005DJ62NM,"I attended this film's limited theatre release expecting something different from the multitude of documentaries and profiles that came before. After all, his son was involved in making the film and the documentary was promoted as revealing a side to Mr. Osbourne we had never seen. Unfortunately, the film proved to be a rather stock effort, depicting the same stories and person we've seen in previous works.

Considering that the documentary was created ""in house"", one would expect some footage, pictures, and/or archival content which hadn't been shown before. Yet, there is nothing to be seen here which hasn't appeared in just about every other documentary on the subject. With Jack Osbourne being involved, there was the promise that we might witness an unguarded moment or gain access to a seldom heard party. But, we see no special moments and the interviews are conducted with the same people we've heard from before, sharing the same reflections we've almost come to expect from them. About the closest we come to a unique voice are a few brief moments with Ozzy's children from his first marriage, Jessica and Louis, and some blunt commentary, on Ozzy as a parent, from some of his second brood. At best, we learn the less than surprising fact that Ozzy wasn't involved in his children's lives as much as he should have been and we see that he is a bit more spiritual than one would expect.

In summary, the documentary isn't bad. The problematic issue arises in that no new ground is covered, nothing new is revealed. In what should have been a unique expose, from a fresh point of view, we end up with the same old story.",1320883200,15,1636,4.777385159010601
4659956,3,B005DJ62NM,"Saw this movie at a special screening at a local theater in Sept-2011. As a true metal fan of nearly 30 years with a more than passing knowledge of Ozzy and Black Sabbath I found it rather boring. The movie, although well made and informative [to new fans], brings NOTHING new to the story of Ozzy and Sabbath. I realize it's not a documentary [which I would have preferred], but a study of the man behind the music. Unfortunately all the anecdotes and intimate moments the movie makers share with us are rehashes of things we've seen on The Osbournes TV show, Behind The Music specials, and 'behind the scene' spots from various Ozzy concert DVDs throughout the years. If you're new to metal and want to learn how Ozzy became the man he is now, this movie is for you, but for real fans who knew of Ozzy before his TV show, you can skip it.",1318377600,16,840,4.356687898089172
4659957,5,B005DJ62NM,"A wonderful documentary film by Ozzy's son, Jack.  Lots of concert footage and fun, but in the end the result is that we find that Ozzy (apparently) believes in ""Him upstairs.""  He has been clean from drugs and alcohol for 5 years now, is much happier, and has a lot of confidence that he never had before.  It would be a great film for anyone who loves Ozzy and anyone who needs a little inspiration in their ""bad habit"" battles!  I could tell you more, but it would ruin some of the surprises!  GO SEE IT!  YOU WON'T BE SORRY.",1314230400,30,528,4.23

4659968,4,B005DJ62NM,"Ozzy. When I was 13 years old (1982) he was my God.  Over the years I have mellowed on his Godlike status, having discovered a lot of things about the Ozzman along the way.  Does the fact that Geezer wrote all the lyrics in Sabbath and Bob Daisley wrote all the lyrics to Blizzard and Diary and so much more tarnish Ozzy's legendary status in my book? Just a little.  Ozzy did come up with melodies in Sabbath and the original Blizzard Of Ozz. Melodies.  He can't play a single musical instrument, and yet he is a Rock God.  Well... what you get in God Bless Ozzy Osbourne (executive produced by his son Jack) is an in-depth (not too in depth) look at The Madman of Rock'n'Roll.  Paul McCartney even chimes in and Tommy Lee has some graphic stories to tell. In the end, we true Ozzy fans have to sift through the debris to see what we think.  If anything, this documentary praises Ozzy's resilience and the fact that he finally, finally, finally got clean and stays clean after all those decades of self-destructive abuse.  Alcohol and pills and cocaine and anything Ozzy could get his hands on, he did.  The fact that he is still alive is amazing.  Interviews with his sister and brother are interesting. The Sabbath stuff is great to watch.  They did glaze over the Randy Rhoads era too quickly, which is sad (also, they show the Brad Gillis era Diary footage right in the middle of talking about Randy, which is lame).  Jake E. Lee non-existent. Nothing much on Zakk either except for some live performances.  This is about Ozzy, and the history here has been brushed over a little to make you feel a little sorry for him, but not too much.  The telling interviews with his children (both sets) are brutal and sincere.  His son Louis, from his first marriage (see the little boy on the cover of Diary Of A Madman) makes you want to weep at how Ozzy abandoned his first family to start another with Sharon, Aimee, Jack and Kelly. Pictures of Ozzy passed out with pill bottles stuck in his mouth are chilling (makes you ask the question why didn't anyone ever intervene?).  In the end Ozzy is a shy, introverted, dyslexic, and often tragic figure to watch.  Many people only know of him from the MTV show The Osbournes and found him strange and funny and a little off-kilter.  What people (myself included) didn't realize was that this was the period where Ozzy was at his worst in regards to narcotics and alcohol, hence the stuttering, shuffling gait, incoherent babble, etc...  America watched with smiles on their faces as Ozzy was secretly (except to his family) killing himself.  Sobriety started with his son Jack and Ozzy, after so many year, finally followed suit.  He has never been happier.  And you can understand him.
Overall, if you're into Ozzy, this is a fun watch.  Even I learned a few things.  But there are so many things left unsaid.  Makes you want someone outside of the Ozzy organization to really show us what happened (but of course Sharon would never allow it). Definitely not for the meek.  Some of the stories here will horrify you (they even horrified Tommy Lee, who was telling them). Take it with a grain of salt, for who really knows how true all of the tales are when Sharon is involved.  Seems mostly honest,  But there are parts that tug at your heart (like Ozzy visiting his neighborhood in Ashton, Birmingham and walking through his childhood home) and make you smile.  Ozzy doesn't ask for forgiveness.  He's a product of his upbringing and substance abuse. And he's one of the Godfathers of Heavy Metal.

4659972,5,B005DJ62NM,"One obvious thing that makes God Bless Ozzy Osbourne so appealing is that the documentary footage is really clean and well-spoken (well, about as coherent as you could possibly get from Ozzy- expect plenty of swearing and derogatory comments of course).  It focuses on quite a bit of personal stuff that I wasn't familiar with and only briefly mentions some of the more popular situations of Ozzy's prolific career (such as biting the heads off bats and doves, as well as the teenager who committed suicide while listening to Ozzy's music back in the 80's).  It's probably a good thing these stories were only mentioned briefly since we've heard them a thousand times by this point.  Still understandable and very important that these events were brought up however, so I'm glad they included them.

While the documentary does a really good job mentioning the Black Sabbath years from 1970-1972 and mentions all the stories on how the band struggled from a rundown Birmingham city in pretty fine detail, for whatever reason it completely skips over the years from 1973-1976 which, thanks to the internet, I now know has several rich stories that could have been shared by the band members had the documentary given them an extra 10 minutes or so to tell them.  By the way, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are pretty vocal in this documentary.  Tony Iommi not so much, though.  I actually never knew Ozzy was such a prankster/comedian during the Black Sabbath years.  I guess it may have been obvious given his stage antics, but apparently he was such a prankster because he was hiding all the real-life struggles he had to deal with at the time, and being funny was his was of coping with life.

Ozzy mentions when he received over 200 dollars for Black Sabbath's first album, the first thing he did was buy a pair of shoes.  Goes to show how poor his living conditions were at the time.  I think I underestimated just how poor the members of Black Sabbath were back then.  They basically had to do anything to survive.  This documentary does an amazing job spending over 30 minutes explaining the Black Sabbath years in pretty good detail- they just shouldn't have skipped the '73-'76 years which, for most fans, is considered a quality, experimental period of Black Sabbath's career.

However they do make up for it by Never Say Die since that's the key changing point of Ozzy's career, and the documentary mentions in fine detail how Ozzy was spending his days in a hotel room doing drugs and destroying his self-confidence after being fired by Black Sabbath, believing he'd never be able to accomplish anything again.  That is, until Sharon came along.  Looking back I do believe Sharon -despite what people may think of her given some of the decisions she's made *ahem* remixing classic Ozzy albums *ahem*- if not for her, where would Ozzy be today?  He probably wouldn't be here.  Hey, some men really need a woman in order to succeed in life and bring out what they're capable of, and Ozzy is living proof.

I feel the documentary should have mentioned more concerning Randy Rhoads and his contributions to the band.  They play a REALLY eerie segment that I've never seen involving Randy receiving a guitar player of the year award with Ozzy and Sharon standing next to him.  You can tell all three of them are really touched that Randy's receiving that award.  Randy mentions, more or less, that he wants to make people proud of his abilities.  Given his untimely death, this is a haunting piece of footage.  Still bugs me a great deal that he died so young, and I'm sure it bugs several other heavy metal fans as well.  Never should have happened.  For some reason the documentary doesn't mention Jake E. Lee's contributions at all, and Zakk Wylde's more substantial long-lasting years are mostly overlooked as well (other than one quick segment).  How can that be?  What a shame.

I think the best moment is when Sharon says that since Ozzy lost so much (his father, being removed from Black Sabbath, leaving his previous family, Randy Rhoads) Ozzy seemed to believe that everything he likes and holds close will eventually go away, so he has to live in the moment so to speak, and that may explain why Ozzy's been so outrageous and daring over the years.  All the drinking and drug taking may be a result of everything he's lost over the years.  Excellent part of the documentary.

However the final 30 minutes makes this documentary worth buying.  It details what Ozzy's like today and how he's coping with finally being able to quit drugs for good (though I could have sworn I heard a rumor a couple months ago that he has returned to drugs, and even rumors of a divorce with Sharon... not sure if any of this is remotely legitimate though).  It mentions the Osbournes reality show and how it actually caught the family at a very bad time since Ozzy was spending much of his days drunk and falling over/sleeping on the couch, and his son Jack mentions how quite a bit of this footage was too inappropriate and realistic for TV viewing so they couldn't show it.  I like the segment at the end where Ozzy finally has his driver's license at the age of 60 so we see him driving away.  He mentions how it's good to leave home once in a while and get a taste of freedom so he can breathe and relax.  The way I'm going, I might not have my license until 60, lol.  I was actually wondering if, given the fact he's British, he may accidentally drive on the other side of the road.  Hey the thought crossed my mind!

Also, AMAZING that Paul McCartney of all people mentions the influence that Black Sabbath had, though I disagree with him.  While Sabbath may have been outrageous and daring when they were a brand new band, he says that nowadays they seem tame in comparison to the type of heavy metal we have now.  However I think Sabbath's music actually stands out and sounds heavier *now* then it did back then, given how different they were compared to other bands at the time.  I understand Paul's logic, however.

The documentary also mentions in pretty fine detail Ozzy's children from his first marriage, who I've never seen until now.  They pretty much don't have a lot of time for their father by mentioning that the memories they have is that Ozzy would return home from a Sabbath concert, do outrageous things such a crash cars into things in the middle of the night, and never really show his children the affection they wanted.  He was never really there for them, and Ozzy even mentions that basically he was too strung out on drugs/drinking or tired to give his first family the devotion they wanted.  We also see Ozzy's siblings which I've never seen until now.  They look *nothing* like Ozzy!  No resemblance whatsoever.  I figure at least his brother would resemble him... not at all.  The sisters look even less like Ozzy.  Of course Ozzy's kids with Sharon are shown, even Aimee- the very attractive older daughter that never appeared on the Osbournes reality show.

I like when Ozzy returns to the rundown apartment building where he grew up as a child.  Looks like a really tiny crammy flat (apartment) building not at all suitable for several children to be living.  How he was able to grow up there without losing his mind is a mystery (though actually he shares he almost DID lose his mind on several occasions, not even remotely enjoying his factory working days during his teenage years).  I'm also surprised he went to jail for 6 weeks. I didn't know about this.  Oh and what about the current Ozzy watching his stage performances from back in the 80's and sharing he doesn't remember a single thing?  I think he also found his onstage persona too unusual to watch which made him feel uncomfortable, prompting him to jump off the couch and leave the room, haha.  Hey that may have been a rough spot for his career due to all the drugs, drinking and chaos with his wife Sharon, but the music sure was arguably a lot better than anything he's been doing recently.

Lots of things I didn't actually know about Ozzy Osbourne makes this documentary pretty awesome.  I like how Sharon mentions several stories of her own, and the haunting story that I do recall watching on another documentary show in the past how Ozzy's drug addiction made him so messed up, he mentioned he was planning on killing Sharon.  Sharon apparently felt it coming since Ozzy wasn't acting like his usual self during this awful low point of his life.  He walks up to Sharon and says something like ""We've come to the conclusion, you have to die"" and Sharon's like ""We???""  The voices in Ozzy's head were part of the ""we"" apparently.  They didn't mention the part where Sharon was struggling to get to the phone in time to call for help, which is what the other documentary mentions.

Overall, great well-made documentary.  I have no complaints other than the fact it completely avoids mentioning the '73-'76 years of Black Sabbath.  You'll get to experience lots of Sabbath and solo Ozzy music while Ozzy's sharing his stories as well, which is a huge benefit.  Perhaps the most unusual part is when we see the current Ozzy warming up his voice for a live performance by taking some kind of test to see how well he can hit the high notes while waiting around in his dressing room.  Strange, haha.",1372982400,,9297,4.633699633699634

Of course, this movie has some really funny stories and jokes - with Ozzy being the madman he is. There are some really cool interviews of people who know Ozzy personally, and have some stuff to share (Tommy Lee in particular!).

But this film also contains a real personal look at who Ozzy is. From the film, you can tell that he is very humble, and truly loves his fans and acknowledges that he wouldn't have anything he has now without them.

Ozzy's spirituality also shows a bit in the film, which I found fascinating (perhaps where the title came from).

Yes, as loyal fans we have heard many of these stories before but the truth does not change. It's a miracle he is still alive after the life he has lived. Ozzy not wanting to relive what was obviously a painful part of his career by talking about Randy should not be held against him. Maybe it's reserved for a separate blu-ray, ever think of that? Or saying he forgot to talk about Jake or anyone or anything should also have no bearing. I am sure there was no disrespect intended. There are most likely hundreds of other people that Ozzy could thank or give honorable mention to but this is not an award ceremony. This is his story, in his own words, and on blu-ray!

Do they use some classic footage? Yes. If theres good stuff, put it in, but there is new stuff too. This movie, I felt, was a brief history lesson of Ozzy from birth to his 60th birthday. It takes a look at Ozzy, the HUMAN BEING, including his struggles with addiction. It only has a small segment about ""The Osbournes"" show and I felt it was great. It sets the record straight on a time when non-Ozzy fans knew who he was and made fun of him for bumbling and stumbling, its cuz he was messed up with addiction still and MTV exploited it. This movie tells the truth and does not shine on Ozzy as being innocent. His second daughter, Jack, and Kelly all straight out say he was not a good dad.

I've been an Ozzy fan for over 20 years and I thought this movie was great. Do you get all, over the top, crazy, Rock n' Roll partying stories... no, but you get some. This movie paints a full picture of the Blizzard of Ozz. I already want to watch it again.",1323216000,2,1274,4.178861788617886
4659991,1,B005DJ62NM,"This is a good documentary if you have maybe just heard about Ozzy like yesterday. If you are a die hard fan or life long fan, you will hate this poorly made POS. The VH1 Ozzy specials are a million times better. The stuff on the BIO channel was a million times better. This film is poorly shot, poorly edited, and leaves out content that real fans want to see. I would have loved to hear stuff I have never heard before like song writing process, relationships with his bandmates through the years, their takes on Ozzy (Joe Holmes, Mike Bordin, Newstead, Zakk, Jake E Lee, or anyone else who is a musician besides Tommy Lee) The Lemmy Doc puts this flick to shame in such a big way because their careers parallel each other in so many different ways AND that was done by two super fans - not the guys son. It's a shame that this is all a bunch of stuff that we have seen and heard before. Plus, if it was supposed to be about him rehabbing completely - you still feel jipped at the end because it isn't presented in a serious enough way. It just seemed like one big complaint about Ozzy and then a happy ending you could see coming a mile away. Sorry, but 2 thumbs down; way down. I wish I had two more hands so I could give this movie 4 THUMBS DOWN!",1323129600,7,1251,4.152263374485597
4659992,1,B005DJ62NM,"This is probably the worst documentary ever made. Even if I knew nothing about Ozzy Osbourne prior to my viewing, I still would have left with no pertinent information on the singer after sitting through this for an hour and a half. It seems like this is more of a fluff piece to attempt to make Ozzy seem interesting and as if he were a good human being. Everything he has gotten in his life (children that don't like him, memory loss, no voice) is directly attributed to things that he has done to himself. But somehow the viewer is to believe that Ozzy has tried his best to be a good dad and worthwhile member of society and he is some kind of victim of circumstances. However, not even whitewashing the truth in such a manner as this documentary does, eliminates the fact that Ozzy isn't where he is based on his talent or his good graces, but rather because he is the luckiest sumbitch in the world. He has ridden the coattails of his bandmates from day one, and this documentary only solidifies this truth.

Don't waste an hour and a half on this. Read a book instead. ANY book.",1323129600,3,1085,4.371287128712871
4659993,1,B005DJ62NM,"If you were looking to get into the Ozzman with this, get his first 6 solo records and his first 6 albums with Black Sabbath. If you already have those great Lps than there is nothing for you here, the title of the dvd alone should show you this is some cash grab from Sharon. This dvd may be interesting to those who never heard the ozzy story before but everyone else should save their cash. How about finishing your sabbath collection? You may be suprised to find that you love Dio and Martin fronted Sabbath albums as much as the ozzy ones!",1323129600,8,544,4.29126213592233
4659994,3,B005DJ62NM,"I was thrilled that someone from the Ozzy camp, namely Osbourne's own son Jack, was going to make a documentary on the Prince of Darkness. I thought it would be great since Jack is Ozzy's son, he's been there for a part of his life and has seen some things and he has access to any information on Ozzy really. Maybe I set my hopes up a little too much, God Bless Ozzy Osbourne is a entertaining documentary film but I feel they were merely scratching the surface here and in this case more would have been better. Fans can tell right away that this documentary is a few years old already. It shows Ozzy's 60th Birthday party which is three years ago now. The most recent live performances show Ozzy with Zakk Wylde and Wylde appears in the documentary in some spots.

In one of the more revealing moments of the documentary, Ozzy's two children with his ex-wife Thelma, Jessica and Louis are interviewed. Jessica almost sounds like she's angry at her dad and doesn't say much positive things, there's a lot of negativity aimed at her dad and from her angle it's quite understandable His son Louis is clear about the fact that Ozzy was never really a dad to him and he also express frustration that his dad can't remember his birthday. Ozzy is asked in what year his daughter was born and he replies ""71, 72 I don't know. I'll find out for you"" and then you can see water in his eyes, even behind those sunglasses. He says he did the best he could with his first two children given the circumstances. I thought the way Sharon analyzed the period of Ozzy's life in which he left his wife Thelma and moved on to Sharon was fairly accurate and set things in perspective. He was fired from Black Sabbath, he already had children and wanted to start a new family with Sharon. Her angle on this and how it affected Ozzy was great. I think maybe the best interview of it all may have been Kelly Osbourne's. She obviously suffered from her dad's crazyness and it had an impact on her. Today she's really happy that her dad has been clean for so long. Jack's interview is similar to his sister and he reveals that when he stopped drugs and alcohol that's when Ozzy decided to stop.

Most of the major events in Osbourne's life addressed. His upbringing in Birmingham, his first wife, his kids, Black Sabbath, going solo, the death of Randy Rhoads, strangling Sharon, reality tv dad and so on. The interviews with musicians and other people were passable but Tommy Lee and others don't say a whole lot that fans aren't already aware of. His Black Sabbath bandmates Geezer Butler and Bill Ward were both interviewed and it was nice to see them here. I love the scene where Ozzy's sitting on his couch at home watching his own music videos and he goes ""these are clich f***ing 80's videos!"". He soon enough proceeds to leave and he is asked ""Ozzy where are you going?"" to which he replies ""Taking a walk, watching this f****** s***..."". Priceless. Seing Ozzy's preparation for a show was fascinating, I didn't know he did the things he did. I wished he would've talked about Jake E. Lee because he is pretty much never talked about, yet he was a great guitarist and made important contributions to both Bark At The Moon (1983) and The Ultimate Sin (1986).

I enjoyed watching God Bless Ozzy Osbourne but here's the problem: it's not long enough to cover everything. I mean this is Ozzy, the Sabbath years alone would take their own documentary and add to that Ozzy years, his personal live, the rumors, the crazyness, the madness of it all... and you'll realize an hour and a half (1h33 minutes to be more precise) is simply too short. Some of the interviews were revealing and interesting, all in all it's a good entertaining hour and a half doc on the legend that is Ozzy but even so you will learn little more than the documentaries on Ozzy that have already been made. For a fan this is something that should be seen, but I was a little disappointed because knowing that they had all the resources to make the ultimate Ozzy documentary it could have been longer and better. 3/5.",1322179200,2,4069,4.488529014844804
4659995,5,B005DJ62NM,"Maybe it helps that I've not seen many Ozzy/Sabbath docs, but I thought Jack did a spectacular job with this film. TONS of killer concert clips from the very beginning to very recently. And while it was interesting to me to hear a few things from Jack's perspective, most of his verbal input was towards the end and seemed unobtrusive and unbiased throughout the film in general. I felt I learned a lot about Ozzy as a rocker and as a family man. I truly think you will not be disappointed - but that's just me.",1321920000,3,511,4.333333333333333
4659996,3,B005DJ62NM,"The documentary is worth buying for the low price, although it could have been so much better. At least half of this is stuff you've all heard before a gazillion times. The saving grace for this is the fact that the footage and filming is done very well and gives you new and different glimpses of Ozzy and the quality is excellent as well, which makes alot of the recent/older stuff obsolete. Also included is interviews with Ozzy's 1st marriage children, along with Amiee, the daughter who stayed out of the ""Osbournes"" reality stuff.

However, there were some glaring misses as well, such as :
1. I wish the Randy Rhoads discussion would have been longer and that there would have been more talk about circumstances surrounding the fateful day in 1982 that he died.
2. Not one mention of Jake E. Lee. How can someone that was your lead guitarist right in the heart of your career (1983-1987) be completely ignored. His contributions are noteworthy and they should have been gracious and included what he did for the band, etc, etc.
3. Zakk Wylde. Man, the guy's been a part of the band for over 20 years and they barely show him for about one minute and again, no talk of his importance to the band. A huge miss. I understand the movie's about Ozzy, but Zakk's a big part of that band image and wrote a bunch of the music that Ozzy and his family profited big-time from.
4. In fact, not much of anything about past band members such as the late Randy Castillo. A discussion about him would have been a great addition to this movie, he was instrumental to Ozzy at the time. And it goes w/out saying, it's a crime to banish Lee Kerslake and the great Bob Daisley from any of this. Differences should have been set aside. And nothing from Tommy Aldridge? Don Airey?
5. Not enough discussion of the Ozzfest years and the launching opportunities of up and coming bands. From '97 to 2006, the Ozzfest was a huge part of everything rock. Basically a passing mention on here.

To summarize, Ozzy the person is this film, but the band/music, while discussed, is mostly absent. The older ""Don't Blame Me"" and ""Behind the Music"" stories cover that a little better, but are quite dated at this point.
Also, i expected much more in ""bonus"" features. Again, very little here.
A good effort, but a big miss at the same time. The most accurate reading i can come up with is 2.5 stars.",1321920000,32,2371,4.4988399071925755
