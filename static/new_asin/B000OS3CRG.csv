8186435,5,B000OS3CRG,"This was one of my favorite cartoons growing up! I love Marsupilami...say that 3 times fast! and his beloved pal Maurice. This is also where we were first introduced to Bonkers, and even sebastian crab had cameos! This was funny, funny cartoon...that even the adults in the room could laugh at and enjoy. If anything there was more adult humor that kid humor in a lot of the skits. I hope they bring it out on DVD, that and Bonkers too! Till then I will just have to buy all the VHS's!",1283212800,,485,4.282608695652174
