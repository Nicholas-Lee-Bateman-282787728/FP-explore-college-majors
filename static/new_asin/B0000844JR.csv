1827202,4,B0000844JR,"You know, the phrase `this movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat' gets thrown around a lot to the point of being clich, but it really does seem to apply to this movie.  Not in the literal sense, mind you, as I was lying down when I saw it, but figuratively speaking, that is, unless you are prone to sitting on the edge of your seat anyway in which case forget what I just said and move on.  (seems like a dumb place to sit anyway...I mean, aren't you just asking for trouble?)  Road Games, released in 1981 and directed by Australian born director Franklin Richards and starring Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee Curtis, is an excellent little movie I had heard absolutely nothing about until it was recommended to me on this website.

The story follows an American truck driver working in Australia, hire to drive a load of slaughtered hogs from Melbourne to Perth across a desolate stretch of highway.  Stacy Keach plays Quid, an intelligent, self-educated man who is keenly observant of his surroundings, trading quips with his companion, a pet dingo that travels with Quid in his cab.  Seems there's a serial killer stalking female victims, and Quid begins to suspect a green van he's seen on the roadways.  Soon Quid picks up Hitch (Jamie Lee Curtis), and things begin to unravel at an alarming pace.  Quid quickly finds himself a suspect, set up by the real killer, in the spate of grisly murders, and must not only clear his name, but also save his own life, as the mysterious stranger in the green van soon goes from being pursued to being the pursuer with the backdrop being some really beautiful wide-open Australian scenery.

Think this sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock movie?  Well, that's exactly what the director was going for and he achieved his goal very nicely.  He manages to build the suspense and maintain it throughout the movie, driving it to one of the more exciting conclusions within a film I've seen in a long time.  Another nice touch is the way he directly avoids showing the violently visceral aspects of the killer's crimes, only alluding to them.  There are many wonderfully, slyly humorous moments littered throughout the film as the director gradually tightens the screws on the viewers.  I found the scene with Quid and Hitch at the rest stop/gas station especially grueling.

Along with a beautiful, wide screen presentation, Anchor Bay provides a number of interesting features including an audio commentary by producer/director Richard Franklin, a 20 minute featurette with the director and actor Stacy Keach, a trailer, talent bios, original storyboards, a poster and still gallery, a wonderful five page insert on the movie, and even the original screenplay available on DVD-ROM.  If you enjoy thoughtful, well-directed thrillers chocked full of suspense and a minimal amount of violence, then see this movie.  It'll be worth your time.  If you like this one, I might suggest Duel (1971), Breakdown (1997), or Joyride (2001).

1827203,4,B0000844JR,"It's amazing how many pleasant treats you'll find on TV Friday nights at one o'clock in the morning. Take ""Roadgames"" (or ""Road Games"") for example: The Hitchcockian story of a trucker delivering meat across Australia who becomes entangled in a possible mystery involving an unapprehensible serial killer who may or may not have murdered a helpless hitchhiker traveling the roads he's driving on.
Often referred to as ""Rear Window"" on the road, self-proclaimed Hitchcock enthusiast Richard Franklin has directed a quaint, low-budget thriller with a likable (although quite unusual) lead actor in the role of Frustrated Hero.
Pat Quid (Stacy Keach--who is indeed a man) is driving across Australia in a meat truck when he thinks he's noticed a strange happening--a man in a van seems to be burying a bag in the middle of a desert in Australia, and when he is noticed he climbs back into his blue van and speeds away into the distance.
Pat puts this event into the back of his mind when he decides against regulations to pick up a wandering hitchhiker named Pam Rushworth (Jamie Lee Curtis), who has run away from home in an effort to escape her famous father's life. The two bond together on the road and have some fun playing various games--until she is kidnapped by the same strange man in a van. At first, Pat thinks he's just being paranoid--he even starts to think that Pam left him for the man.
But then he realizes that Pam has indeed been kidnapped, and he suspects that the strange man in the van might be a notorious serial killer who has been killing young women and scattering their body parts miles apart from each other.
After the police offer no help, Pat takes matters into his own hands and sets off on a quest to bring back Pam to safety and apprehend the killer before he can strike again. Some twists and turns ensue, although nothing very surprising.
If this were a mainstream horror film with an overblown budget and big-name actors, I'd probably give ""Roadgames"" a bad rating. But this is the type of pleasant, likable low-budget thriller that is easy to watch and knows it's nothing more than a shadow of greater film noir mysteries/thrillers like ""Rear Window"" or ""The Third Man""--the type of film that thrusts its hero on a one-man venture into the heart of darkness in order to find out the truth.
Stacy Keach is strikingly likable as the lonely trucker who talks to his own pet dingo as he drives along, contemplating all types of conspiracy theories about serial killers and mysteries. What could definitely become tiring--listening to a man talk to his dingo for the majority of a movie, that is--actually becomes quite fun. Keach is funny, nice, and just...likable! Too bad his career was put on hold years later after he got arrested for smuggling cocaine...
The director, Richard Franklin, is a huge Hitchcock fan--and it shows. This film is like a sort of remake of ""Rear Window"" and other such mystery-thrillers. It's loads of fun and an easy watch. (Trivia note: Franklin directed ""Psycho II,"" the sequel to Hitchcock's 1960 classic original.)
I can definitely say that this film is most like ""Breakdown,"" the Jonathan Mostow movie starring Kurt Russell as a man who loses his wife to a trucker and tries to get her back, even though there seems to be no evidence of her disappearance. But unlike the great ""Breakdown,"" this film doesn't wither away in the second half and turn into a disappointing movie--it remains strong throughout, and yes, it has plenty of nods towards Hitchcock. (Check out the magazines Curtis starts sorting through--there he is!)",1075161600,3,3590,4.810679611650485

1827209,5,B0000844JR,"I first saw ""Road Games"" in the theater during its initial release; a friend and I had bought tickets to ""Caveman"", but despite the presence of Ringo Starr, it was so boring we left halfway through. We wandered in to the theater next door and caught the balance of ""Road Games"" beginning with the hallucination of the eyes in the back of the van. We both enjoyed the film, but I never saw the rest of it until I found it decades later on DVD: it was worth the wait. This is one of the few DVDs I would never part with.

I am not a fan of slasher movies, but do like psychological thrillers. Despite the US marketing playing on Jamie Lee Curtis' fame as a horror queen at the time, this is not a slasher movie, but is an homage to Hitchcock on the Australian Outback. Stacy Keach as Pat Quid, an American who drives trucks in Australia (Keach actually learned to drive the truck for the shoot, by the way) steals the show. This was just before his Mike Hammer days, and his classical training in Shakespearian drama aids his array of emotions as he tracks a mysterious killer across Australia. To allow dialogue Keach is paired up with his buddy, Boswell, a dingo (actually an Australian Red dog, which is part dingo) to great effect. The film jumps from light (Keach playing classical music on the harmonica) to the macabre (what is the man in the green van doing and what is in his lunch pail?)  Jamie Lee Curtis stars as ""Hitch"" is a relatively small role; the dynamics between Keach and Curtis worked beautifully, and quantifiably added to the tension in the film.

As Keach hauls a load of refrigerated hog carcasses to Perth, he crosses paths with numerous other motorists multiple times to great effect, but it's clear early on that his primary nemesis is the lunatic in the green van who opens the movie with a clever garroting of a young girl with a guitar string. Dialogue from Everett De Roche is sharp (""Why does anybody get up at five in the morning to watch the garbage collectors?"") Fortunately Keach is up to the challenge of sometimes complicated and long passages of dialogue (""'Quid'...'Q' as in 'Quartermaster', 'U' as in 'Utopia', 'I' as in 'Ice Cream', and 'D' as in 'Death of a young girl, you cretin!'"") Interspersed with the serious plotline of tracking the killer and Quid himself being effectively framed for the murder in a very clever way, there are moments of comic relief involving the other highway motorists, most comically ""Captain Careful"" who is towing his boat, the ""Lady Luck II"", on a trailer. It turns out you can drive a semi straight through a boat to great comedic effect.

After picking up Hitch (Curtis), they banter about the psychological makeup of the killer and ultimately make a pit stop at a dingy roadside gas station where while dealing with another often-encountered character, ""Sneezy Rider"", Hitch is kidnapped by the lunatic in the green van while trying to see if the murdered girl's remains are inside. As Keach debates about how the back door to the trailer got opened and why are there 352 pig carcasses versus the pre-departure 350 that were counted, he closes in on the van in a chase scene that gets slower and slower and more and more claustrophobic. Even though it was heavily cut due to time pressures, it is one of director Richard Franklin's true masterstrokes, concluding in a dramatic way where Boswell saves the day by revealing himself to be a dog and not a dingo much to Keach's surprise as he barks to signal the final reveal of the plot in a brilliant conclusion, as dingos can't bark. The film has an added stinger at the very end that Franklin didn't want to do but the producers insisted on to be able to market it more as horror than as suspense. I won't spoil it, but it is the one part of the film I am not totally enthralled with.

""Road Games"" may be a challenge to find, but it really is worth it. It does everything a great suspense thriller should do: it gives clues and sets up situations to maximize tension and builds to a fantastic final reveal which rewards the viewer like few other films in the genre. It is definitely underappreciated, and Richard Franklin and Stacy Keach made what was a good thriller truly great. I love this movie.",1445126400,2,4228,4.550591327201051

The DVD comes with loads of worthwhile extras, starting with a great ""making of' documentary, ""Kangaroo Hitchcock: The Making of 'Road Games'"" which features interviews with Franklin and Keach and discusses the project at length. Originally the part of Quid was written for Sean Connery, but unfortunately his salary was greater than the entire $8,000,000 budget of the film (which was the biggest budget Australian film to date) but fortunately they ended up with Keach, who I think was born for the role (and who clearly loved it). Franklin is a great director and explains a lot of directorial choices in a very interesting way; the original storyboards are wonderful. The best extra on the DVD is a commentary track with Franklin and Anchor Bay DVD producer Perry Martin. Simply put, it's one of the best commentary tracks I have ever seen. I was interested that Franklin frequently referred to Keach as the most intellectual actor he worked with (which is why, I suppose, Quid gets away quoting ""The Canterbury Tales"" and the like); the backstory concerning the union issues involved with this picture were also interesting, though from a more logistical standpoint. There are also a ton of posters, stills, original storyboards, and the screenplay on DVD-ROM included, and all of those are recommended. One final extra are the incredibly detailed star and director biographies: Keach is, in particular, a fascinating person.

1827214,5,B0000844JR,"I saw this years ago and was recently watching something else when this film and Fortress (another great film from Oz) were mentioned.  What makes this film stand out is the deadpan comedic moments, very larrikin like, and the way Keach's monologue with his Dingo companion furthers the story. Although I always thought Jamie Lee was a weak actress, in this movie the dialogue was so good and the apparent chemistry with Stacy made it work.  Stacy as ""Quid"" is clearly losing a bit of his personal reality taking those long trips across Australia, and inventing drama in his mind, only this time, it is actually happening.  The supporting characters are funny and relevant to the plot.  Like other reviewers, the  horror ending is not needed, the suspense and conclusion had played out well, but apparently the US distributors wanted something so it was added post production.

1827218,4,B0000844JR,"While transporting a shipment of meat from Melbourne to Perth, a truck driver suspects that he may be on the trail of a killer, in the suspense thriller Roadgames (1981).  Stacey Keach (Mike Hammer) is Patrick Quid, an independent trucker who has thoughts that the driver of a green van he has seen during his travels, may be picking up and murdering young female hitchhikers.

While on the road with his dingo named Boswell, Quid hears news reports on the radio about the discovery of human body parts, and a suspected serial killer who may be on the loose.  The questionable behavior of the man driving a green van, causes Quid to make a report to the police.  It's against regulations, but Quid also picks up hitchhikers, which produces some interesting results, when he stops for a young woman named Pamela (Jamie Lee Curtis) who is on the run from her family.

When Quid's truck is pulled over by the police, he learns that he is a player in a dangerous game, as thanks to the mysterious van driver, he is a person of interest in the disappearance of the young women.  Quid discusses his suspicions with Pamela, and when the opportunity presents itself, she enters the van to investigate.  It appears that she may have been abducted, but after giving chase, Quid concludes that Pamela has hitched herself another ride.

Directed and co-written by Richard Franklin (Psycho II), Road Games is a fairly well-written, and works in large part due to Stacey Keach's engaging performance, as much of the screen time involves Quid in his truck, with his loyal dingo Boswell.  Keach is extremely likeable and natural in the role, as a poetry sprouting driver, who is prone to talking to himself.  As Pamela, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, True Lies) is mature, confident and very sassy, and she has great rapport with her co-star.  Like Keach, Curtis is immediately likeable, and though she isn't onscreen that much, you really do care, when her character ""Hitch"" disappears.  Aside from a shredded boat, not that much happens in the way of action while travelling on the road, but even so, the film manages to create a nice atmosphere of suspense and tension.  The level of action picks up slightly at film's finish, but it's still a rather unspectacular, grinding to a halt type conclusion.  There are lots of unanswered questions, as the ending is just barely palatable.  Road Games isn't readily available on DVD, but it may occasionally pop up on the TCM schedule.",1310515200,3,2463,4.789598108747045
1827219,4,B0000844JR,"Now and then you run into a flick that is so unique you cannot help but wonder what was on the producer's/writer's/director's minds that would put a green light on it. 'Road Games' is one of those flicks. First off is that it's an Aussie flick and the two main characters are American. Was this something they were making in hopes of a big score stateside? Then there's the fact that it's essentially a mystery/thriller where the thriller part almost takes a back seat to the characters.

Stacey Keach plays an over-the-road trucker whose current load consists of butchered pigs on their way to Perth. Radio reports speak of a killer on the loose and Keach keeps spotting a particular green van that rouses his suspicion. He picks up a hitchhiker (Jamie Lee Curtis) and when he finds himself unable to put the authorities on the scent of the suspect the two figure they should take matters into their own hands.

This is very much about character. Keach doesn't consider himself a truck driver. He figures he's a guy who happens to be driving a truck at this point in his life. He constantly waxes poetic or philosophic and devises various games he can play to occupy his mind while engaged in the mind-numbing process of endless driving. His has a companion in the form of (he thinks) a dingo. He picks up Curtis and finds her (as she finds him) a very interesting person.

The two play off each other rather well. Unfortunately Curtis comes in rather late in the game and shortly thereafter disappears. The film could have used much more of her. That being said, this is a nifty little flick. The production values are good enough and there are a lot of odd turns. One is the fact that Australia is a large continent but only has about 30 million people, most of which live on the coasts. As a result the same few characters keep showing up in different places during the movie. The film makers totally screw up the climax. It just wouldn't happen. And the post script is unnecessary, but by then the movie is over.

1827223,4,B0000844JR,"""Road Games"" is a subtle, visceral shocker from director Richard Franklin (""Psycho II"" and ""Link"").  A maniac is strangling beautiful hitchhikers and butchering them like animals.  Could it be the guy in the green van who, early in the morning, watches the garbage being picked up outside his hotel room and buries plastic bags in the middle of the desert?  Could it be Pamela Rushworth (scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis of ""Halloween,"" ""Prom Night"" and ""Terror Train""), a runaway hitchhiker who keeps appearing along the highways before finally disappearing just as mysteriously?  Or could it be Pat Quid (Stacy Keach of ""Mickey Spillane`s Mike Hammer""), a lonely, quirky truck driver; he talks to himself and spies on fellow travelers, imagining what they do for a living, while all the time he is transporting slaughtered pigs to market?

  In this Hitchcock-like film, appearances can be very deceiving.  ""Road Games"" is more of a psychological thriller than a slasher flick.  It has a low body count and not very much blood and gore.  However, it is very tense, especially when Pamela disappears and Quid dreads the worst.  The beautiful desolation of the Australian outback adds to the fear and isolation felt by the protagonist, Quid, and the viewer.  The outback offers a millions places to hide a corpse.  Quid does have one companion during his nightmare - an adorable Dingo; however, since it can't bark, it can not warn him of impending danger.

  ""Road Games"" offers a neat package of thrills, chases, mystery and suspense in the Australian outback.  Fans of Jamie Lee Curtis will be a little disappointed to learn that her role is a minor but very important one.  Having achieved much fame from ""Halloween,"" her role in ""Road Games"" was more of a very special guest appearance.  Stacy Keach gives a remarkable performance as the truck driver who is unhappy with his station in life.  Fans of ""vehicular stalker"" movies, such as ""Hitcher,"" ""Breakdown"" and ""Joy Ride,"" will want to see this film.  As I wrote earlier, it is not your high body count slasher flick that was made popular during the early eighties.  Anchor Bay has provided a wonderful package replete with widescreen presentation, closed captions, a collectable booklet, audio commentary and a new ""making of"" featurette co-starring Stacy Keach.",1243555200,3,2318,5.013089005235602
1827224,5,B0000844JR,"I caught this movie on TV many years ago & thought it was terrific, due largely to a great performance by Stacy Keach as eccentric yet likable ""truck driver"" Quid (""Just because I happen to drive a truck, that does not make me a TRUCK DRIVER"").  His rambling monologues, musings, and witty observations about his fellow motorists add humor, and the chemistry between him and Jamie Lee Curtis seems genuine and not at all forced.  Curtis is equally charming (not to mention absolutely stunning), so much so that you wish she had more screen time.  The plot is pure Hitchcock as Quid suspects the mysterious driver of a green van to be the culprit behind a string of Jack-the-Ripper-style killings along the highways and byways of Australia.  Unfortunately, the more Quid tries to untangle the mystery, the more entangled he becomes as other motorists, and eventually the police, begin suspecting HIM of being killer.  This is low-budget suspense at it's very best, and I'm so glad it made the technological jump onto DVD (it even comes with a 6-page booklet containing a mini-essay from someone who seems to think just as highly of this movie as I do).

There is nice character development, suspense and even highly entertaining moments. Fans of road movies like Duel, Breakdown and Joyride should enjoy Road Games because it ranks amongst the best of them! The DVD Anchor Bay put together is nice as with most of their releases and there is a ""making-of"" special feature. I liked the music score in this too which is always a plus. Road Games is a lost treasure that hopefully more people will discover. It can easily be watched again and again.",1239148800,3,1028,4.685082872928176
1827226,5,B0000844JR,"Keach plays Quid, a truck driver delivering pork to Perth, Australia. He beats the boredom of the road by looking at other cars and the people inside them and guessing their line of work, etc. He gets too accurate with his game when a serial killer picking up hitchhikers and leaving them in pieces crosses Quid's path. Keach's character is witty and has more personality than most portrayals of truck drivers. A young Jamie Lee Curtis teams up with Quid and together they try to find out if their guessing game about the strange man in the green van is fact or fiction. When Pamela (Jamie Lee Curtis) gets too close to the killer she nearly becomes a victim herself. Great dialogue, humor and numerous quirky characters.

1827227,4,B0000844JR,"This is one of those movies that gets sorely overlooked because it doesn't pander to the slasher & gore genre ,in true classic horror movie fashion it let's your own imagination do most of the work. You get drawn into the characters because they never seem pretentious or one dimensional ,this is also very much in the Hitchcok vein, so if you are looking for something a little different w/thought instead of gore this is the ticket.",1115510400,13,434,4.64935064935065
1827228,4,B0000844JR,"oOkay, this isn't so much horror as super suspense. Jamie Lee doesn't even appear in the first half of the movie. Stacy Keach spends the time driving across country trying to get away from some unseen psycho in a truck. But after he picks up Jamie Lee, you really feel like you've entered a classic Jamie Lee slasher flick!

This movie is a must for Slasher/Scream Queen fanatics.",1113523200,12,380,4.588235294117647
1827229,4,B0000844JR,"A movie that is highly watchable and a pleasure to see again after all these years.  Stacy Keach stars as a truck driver who notices the behaviour of a driver in a green van.  Everywhere Stacy goes, the man is close by committing a crime - or is he?  Very hitchock in style, the movie keeps you guessing as to what is really going on.  Director Richard Franklin makes no apologies for his love of Hitchcock's work, and while this film is largely unknown, it is worth your time just to see how a great director works.  Back when this was made, there was much controversy over the use of two american actors for a film set in Australia.  However, to finance it back then, it required big names.  Unfortunately, it didn't help win the film an audience back in 1981 which surprises me because it really is very good. I assume appropriate marketing of the film was not undertaken.

Road Games has a genuine eeeery feeling to it.  If you enjoy watching films with clever direction then check out this film.  It is not a horror film as some reviewers have stated, it is more a suspense thriller - A BIG DIFFERENCE!",1113177600,8,1107,4.4088669950738915

1827232,4,B0000844JR,"Fans of movies like ""Joy Ride"" with Paul Walker, ""Breakdown"" with Kurt Russell, and ""The Duel"" with Dennis Weaver should enjoy this movie. I saw this when it was first released since I am a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis and Stacy Keach. I think she is great and Stacy Keach does an excellent job as well. Fans of Keach will love this role. I have followed him all his career and I think this is one of his best roles. As an American driving a semi-truck in Australia he hauls freight. As he travels around the countryside with his pet dingo he notices some suspicious incidents along the highway. When he finds out there are murders taking place he tries to catch the killer only to be accused of murder too.

Not so much a slasher but a tension building teaser that keeps you guessing if Curtis is dead or alive. Richard Franklin does a superb job of directing. Many people compare it to a Hitchcock style. They are right because the movie does indeed not center on seeing people butchered. This movie builds the suspense without gore until the shocking conclusion. It allows you to follow along on the edge of your seat as Keach tries to unravel the mystery. Good pace that will keep everyone watching. This is one that all but small children should see. I plan to add this one to my collection.",1093478400,3,1291,4.42436974789916
7979084,5,B0000844JR,"This Australian film is surprisingly great!  It feels like an Alfred Hitchcock film.  The Director, Richard Franklin, is clearly a well-studied Hitchcock devotee.  It seems this was Franklin's proof-of-concept, buying him the credibility to go on after this to direct Psycho 2.",1525564800,,277,5.5476190476190474
7979085,4,B0000844JR,"Came across this gem a few weeks ago while flipping thru channels when it was on the Charge! TV network. Id never seen it nor heard of it before but was so impressed how different it was and the unusual style. Didnt get to see the ending  which is just as well because I wanted to see the whole movie uncut and in widescreen if it existed. Fortunately I found the blu-ray on here for a decent price. You can tell Keach had a lot of fun making this movie - you can see it in his performance - and he's stated it's one of his personal favorites.

As far as the disc itself, for a relatively unknown movie (at least here in the US), its got a lot of extra content, much of it very interesting - especially from the director (Franklin) and the production crew interviews. Whats interesting is you get so see multiple interviews from Keach and Franklin done at different periods of their lives and see how theyve changed each time. Some of this will probably be fascinating for film students, especially the 2-hr crude video segment from a 1980 lecture which includes the director and composer Brian May (who did the original Mad Max movie soundtracks). One of the extras, Not quite Hollywood Interviews is mislabeled as it lists Grant Page (the stunt coordinator and the villain in the movie) as one of them being interviewed - hes not. But they do included an audio interview with him from a different segment. Its a bit hard to understand however, because its done over the phone. Most, if not all of the films shortcomings you will see was due to decisions made at AVCO and the bureaucracy level, not the directors (like the very last shot in the movie), which you can tell he was not real happy about.

As far as the disc quality, I really like it except I wish they hadnt made it as dark and contrasty. I actually like the included HD trailer picture quality better and wished they had redone the whole movie the same way. But overall its very clean and excellent overall.  Bottom line: this is a great blast from the past and lots of fun to watch.",1515542400,,2049,4.398416886543536

7979093,3,B0000844JR,"I was disappointed with this one, thought from all the glowing reviews that it was going to be something great.  It's a watchable slow paced thriller, that has stood it's time more so than a lot of other films made in 1981. Basically it's about an American trucker, who has been in Australia for a while and is reluctantly when he wants to be resting due to his workload, transporting pig carcasses from Melbourne to Perth, because abattoir workers in Western Australia are on strike.  Before he heads to Melbourne, he awakens early in the morning, lets' his dingo out to do its business and witnesses a man behind a curtain paying way too much attention to his dingo sniffing around garbage that is about to be collected.  He discusses with his dingo the oddity of it all when it gets back in the truck, as he will basically all his internal thoughts throughout the movie when a hitchhiker isn't in his truck.  Once he has picked up the refrigerated trailer, and starts the long journey west, he is perplexed by the behaviour of some of his fellow motorists, especially a green van that is trailing him and not behaving as he would expect.  Unbeknownst to him radio reports are rife with a story about a serial killer and when his first hitcher informs him or this and points out a guy burying something with a shovel, he becomes to believe that van driver is that serial killer.  He's also noticed, that the van driver has definitely noticed him.

I found the movie quite good for the first half, with exceptions such as a long game of I spy with the old woman, but the second just got boring and dragged on. It's marketed as Rear Window on Wheels, and that's a fair assessment. Though it's also marketed with the name Jamie Lee Curtis predominantly on the cover, she plays a hitchhiker, who he calls Hitch, but she doesn't have a lot of screen time.  If you're annoyed by road hogs, you'll really enjoy seeing one towing his boat get his comeuppance in Road Games.",1486252800,,1967,4.52112676056338
