8467095,5,B005DL6PV4,"Unique as all Rossellini films. This one is in beautiful colors and in the swashbuckling style but more into political intrigues. The DVD sold here is very good quality with a good transfer. The original negative of this was lost in a fire, so it's great that a clean print was found to make the transfer from. This is not an essential Rossellini film the way Paisan, Germany Year Zero and Stromboli certainly are, but it is still quite excellent and not deserving of the lazy pan given by the other reviewer.",1421452800,,509,4.543478260869565

I imagined him counting the time to get to his villa while making it",1415577600,,119,4.173913043478261
