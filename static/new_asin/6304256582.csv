The name change was utterly horriffic, not to mention the story in general:  Basically, for  those of you who don't know, they took the first 2 volumes of the greatest  series of all time and hacked them up into this video.  The change of name  to Zolom and the entrance of Sharin, who was never even IN the real thing,  made me mad.

827483,1,6304256582,"This was a horrible trashing of Yukito Kishiros wonderous work. To list everything I'd go over my word limit.  To those who complainabout Gallys name change, I have most of the original Japanese manga, and the name on her motorball helmet is Gally.  They do a fair job with the Gally/Hugo relationship, and in fact if the cut out the rest of the garbage the video would be worth more than the current video. As it stands the video isn't worth a wad of used toilet paper.  Think Highlander 2: The Quickening.  Major problems: Zapan was relegated to a brief close up.  Thats it.  The whole thing with Gally saving the baby was lost.  The whole Makoku thing...  they hosed that up and in the process wrecked at least half a dozen subplots.  Vector did not die in the original, in fact he plays a pivotal(and on the side of good!) role at the end of the manga.  As I said they did ok on the Gally/Hugo thing, and I'd probably call it an excellent, truly classic job if it wasn't for all the bull in the first half.  But with all that c**p in the way the video isn't even worth the cost of the raw materials used in making it.  Unless the Gally/Hugo thing is your favorite part of the series and you could care less about the rest of the story, or you have never read the manga and don't plan to, don't waste your money.",934848000,3,1315,4.236947791164659

My only regret is that I didn't pick that title up in my early years of anime fandom since I clearly remember seeing a VHS display for this at the local Hollywood Video back in the day.

STORY

Battle Angel takes place in a hellhole known as Scrap Iron City.  Above Scrap Iron City is a much fantasized floating paradise named Zalem.  Scrap Iron City is seething with vile criminals, and the most vile ones attack people and take their organs to sell in the black market (particularly spines, which are the most valuable).  Due to a lack of police, an organization simply known as ""The Factory"" hires SIC citizens as bounty hunters, who literally bring in the heads of criminals for cash.  Cyber Doctor Ido rebuilds a broken female cyborg and names her Gally.  Gally eventually finds a talent for hunting, and falls in love with a boy named Yugo, who on the outside looks like a mechanical repairman.  However, things start to look dour when Ido's former partner, Dr. Chiren, tries to ""outdo"" Dr. Ido in cyborg combat and when crime boss Mr. Vector lures Yugo into a life of crime for the promise of getting to Zalem.

CHARACTERS

One of Battle Angel's best traits is its characters.  The development of them is really well-thought out and they behave in complex, realistic fashions.  Gally is a great character because of her intrigue due to the loss of her original memories.  However, as the anime goes along, Gally gains awareness of her surroundings and becomes a fully fleshed out character.  Yugo is also great because his actions blur the line between good and evil.  This is so because Yugo, in desperation to fulfill his lifelong dream to earn enough credits to get to Zalem, resorts to spine-thieving, under Mr. Vector's orders, to earn credits quicker.  Even though he resorts to these heinous actions, he's not necessarily a bad person because he's desperate to get a better life and escape from Scrap Iron City.  Even some of the ""bad"" characters like Dr. Chiren are interesting because they don't act in such one-sided, cartoonish manners.  We see Dr. Chiren as a villain at first, but as we see her more, she does the bad things she does under the promise for a better life (along with Yugo).  On a humorous note, I think Mr. Vector looks like the anime version of jazz and film legend Scatman Crothers.

SETTING

Aside from the great characters, Battle Angel gives the audience a setting that perfectly matches the mood it sets out to make.  Scrap Iron City is a cyberpunk hellhole; seething with crime and an all around ugly appearance, which is appropriate since it is after all, built out of the garbage dumped from Zalem.  Scrap Iron City itself is quite unique because unlike most Blade Runner-influenced cyberpunk anime where it often takes place in an overpopulated high-tech metropolis, Scrap Iron City looks like  what would happen if a city was built in the wastelands from The Road Warrior (heck, even one of the cyborg criminals bears a small visual resemblance to Wez) with everyday life integrated with Blade Runner-like technology (computers and cyborgs, etc.).  The fact that Battle Angel was a low budget production from 1993 also gives it sort of a grainy picture to it as well, enhancing the unnerving mood the unpleasant visuals present.

CYBORG TECHNOLOGY

What I really like about the cyborgs in Battle Angel is that they don't look perfectly ""human,"" you can immediately tell that they're machines, and it shows the grittiness of Scrap Iron City since they don't have fancy parts to make the cyborgs look like sexual eye candy.  Even Gally's body doesn't have the ""perfect"" look to it since only her head looks ""human,"" and everything else below looks entirely mechanical.  There's even robots shown throughout Battle Angel that look like they were thrown together by random scrap, particularly the robots that work for ""The Factory.""

THEMES

Battle Angel also has several themes going for it, and all of them are incorporated very well into the anime.  The most noticeable one is the love theme, which takes place between Gally and Yugo, and the romance itself is pretty sad.  There's also themes of freedom, obsession, and following one's dreams all accentuated in Yugo's fixation on leaving Scrap Iron City and getting to Zalem.  This is also pretty sad because Yugo is so fixated on his lifelong dream, that he's blind to the good things he already has in life.

ACTION SCENES

Battle Angel has some great, bloody action scenes that add to the overall story and don't seem tacked on to grab the viewer's attention.  For an anime with a limited budget, the fight scenes between Gally and several cyborg criminals are well done since I don't really recall much, if any cels being reused during these scenes.  The most notable fight scene is between Gally and Grewcica (main cyborg criminal).  Grewcica uses crazy things like extending fingers that can slash and destroy just about anything, while Gally relies only on her agility and strong body to fight the fiend.  When Ido confronts Grewcica and one of his minions towards the beginning, it was pretty awesome to see him fight the mechanical monsters because it's not everyday that you see a guy in a black trench-coat use a rocket-powered hammer (with a sharp end, nonetheless) to destroy his foes.

MATURE CONTENT

This certainly isnt' an anime I'd let the kids see because while not a constant bloodbath, there's some moments that are pretty gruesome.  The most notable example would be prior to the previously mentioned duel, the upgraded Grewcica uses his sharp, extending fingers to slice a helpless dog to death, with blood and entrails being shed in decent detail.  There's fleeting nude and sex scenes involving Dr. Chiren and Mr. Vector, though it's only Chiren's body that's portrayed in the nude.

APPEARANCE

The animation for this is pretty standard for a low budget anime from the early 90's, but I don't have any gripes with this whatsoever because the minor imperfections that exist within the animation give it a charm that anime today horribly lacks.  The only real noticeable ""cel recycle"" is when towards the beginning, when a young woman runs from two cyborg criminals, you see her running and the background looks like its being repeated as she runs.  However, I think they partially covered that up by designing that corridor with a semi-repeating structural pattern.  The artwork for Battle Angel is quite good since the backgrounds are painted in great detail and accentuate the grittiness of Scrap Iron City.  The character art is also well done and makes them very distinct.  Another quality product from Japan's greatest animation studio, Madhouse!!

FINAL WORD

My only gripe with Battle Angel is that they could have made it a little longer since all together, this OVA only runs at about 50 minutes.  However, what they achieved in that little time is certainly more impressive than most anime titles that have over ten times the running length but pad most of it out with pointless filler (I'm looking at you, Witchblade).  If you want some gritty cyberpunk anime that's intelligent and touching, all while being short yet to the point, then Battle Angel will be a great addition to your anime collection.",1276646400,,7464,4.838455476753349
827800,4,6304256582,"Not as good as the manga but Nobuteru Yuuki's character designs and the weird technobeat soundtrack are good enough to reasons to own this retro classic DVD.  A must have for all you Battle Angel fans who are tired of waiting for the Cameron movie to come out.

827801,5,6304256582,"This anime rocks on EVERY level.  It has the most die-hard action and suspence, but more importantly, it has heart.  It's extremely painful and dramatic towards the end.  But it conveys a message of hope, love and understanding.  That's why I like it, and that's why I treasure it.  It speaks to the heart and never shuts up!  GREAT ANIME, EXCLAMATION POINT",1251331200,,357,4.67741935483871
827802,4,6304256582,"Battle Angel. This title was one of the first titles to truly make me appreciate anime, in a couple of aspects.

One: Storyline. While incomplete in this OVA, I discovered the Manga off of which it was based and found out that there was much more to it, that this was incomplete. And what was given here is very good. For a while I thought anime was all about the action (the first ones I had seen were mostly fighting game ones as well as Toonami stuff), but in watching this as well as shows like Evangelion, Blue Seed, and the Heroic Legend of Arislan, not only was I seeing glorious action sequences, but I was enjoying the storyline.

Two: Watching Anime with it's original Japanese audio track. I had taken a look at this at my local Blockbuster, but for a while put it aside because of this. Of course, at the time I was a young, naive pre-teen and just learning what anime was, and to cap it all off, I didn't particularly like reading. But one day I decided to give it a go. To say the least, it was... different. It gave me a whole new look on viewing Anime. Since then, I have always preferred subs.

As for the OVA itself? Well, I mentioned one of it's faults already: it's an incomplete story. In all honesty, only die hard fans of the manga NEED to have this, because the thing it's best for is as a little add-on to the manga. But on it's own, Battle Angel is actually a pretty good film. It's well-written, well-drawn, well-animated when it needs to be, and all-around good fun.

BUT! It is definitely not for children. My father did not really care too much as long as I could handle it at my young age, but it really is R-rated material, mainly because the violence is very graphic. Perhaps the gore is a wee-bit exaggerated at times, but not to the level of something like Apocalypse Zero, Violence Jack or Ninja Resurrection. The sex-related stuff is pretty tame in comparison to the violence. Breasts and butts are bared, but only for a quick glimpse. There is also one brief sexual situation.

Overall, I can't say that this OVA adds great depth to one's collection, but what it does do is give you a bloody good time for your money. Give it a try.",1230940800,,2170,4.348148148148148
827803,3,6304256582,"I bought this knowing that the story would be different, and it was! I liked it, but I'll have to try listening to it in Japanese. Alita (Gally, in this OVA), has SUCH an irritating voice in english. She's too girly compared to the manga. There should have been more action, but what was there was pretty good.

Hugo was a jerk, not the out of reach tease he was in the manga.

I have to say there were way too many sex scenes! (Just two, but it was indecent!)

I enjoyed it, especially ""Tears Sign"" (""Tears of an Angel"" in the manga).

If you choose between this and the manga though, get the manga. 5 million times better!",1222992000,2,624,4.218487394957983
827804,1,6304256582,"Bone Fox's review is pretty close to how I feel about this anime.  I am also a die-hard Battle Angel Alita fan and this attempt to convert the novels to an anime is a joke.

Too much of the story is left out.  For example, the first face off between Alita and Makaku where Alita suffered a defeat, which in turn leads Ido giving her the berserker's body (which plays a massive role in book 5).  Makaku's past and how he came to be was left out and replaced with him receiving help from a made up character that was never in the novels.  Another massive mistake was leaving out the ""small fights"" between Alita and Zapan which later leaves to what is know as ""the point of no return"" in the series.  There are other big mistakes and holes in the story.  To type them all would lead to about 3-4 pages long...

I agree with Bone, if you have never read the novels, you may like this anime.  If you have read them, this anime will make you sick and wish that it never came to be.  I truly hope James Cameron can do the movies that he is planning to do and do them right and stay true to the novels.  I know Cameron is a big fan of the series, but I am worried he may already be making the mistake of wanting to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ido.  Arnold as Ido...it doesn't fit...",1174780800,3,1277,4.104838709677419
827805,2,6304256582,"To begin, I am a die-hard fan of the Battle Angel Alita manga.  When I first saw this 'episode' of the Battle Angel anime and the anime version of 'Tears of an Angel' I was very disapointed.  I agree with the offcial reveiw that it is impossible to translate Yukito Kishiro's extensive manga into an animated format without losing the incredible artwork.  However, the loss of the story is what disapointed me the most.

I feel that the depth of the original plot is simply cheapened in the anime.  The main villian (Makaku in the manga) has been replaced by a simple ""brain eating gladiator"".  The intense scenes where Alita attempts to save Koyomi from Makaku are completly left out.  The anti-hero Desty Nova, who plays a significant role in the later books, is also missing.

If you have never read the manga, you may enjoy this.

If you have read and enjoy the manga, you may want to save your money.",1124064000,13,905,4.537037037037037
827806,5,6304256582,"Good:

* Intense blood and gore.

* Deep storyline (easy to understand).

* Cool character desing (so look alike to the anime in Kill Bill).

* Great action scenes with good animation (there were like 3 or 4 action scenes).

Bad:

* The graphics were kind of smudgy.

* Sad story.

The story is simple because is about this robot girl called Gally who want to become an assasin for hire so she can get a better life but later the problems become more complicated.

This anime is not those who seeks for action-packed, this is more like a violent movie but is still a classic and very recomended for anime fans.

P.S: The english dub was GREAT but way to overacted at times, I think the voices were better than the acting but is worth to hear, so don't pay to much attention to the other people because is not THAT bad. In fact! this is one of the best dubs I ever heard since Princess Mononoke and Twilight of the Darkmaster.

827895,5,6304256582,"Battle Angel is my all-time favorite anime. It is the story of a beautiful young cyborg girl. A cybernetics doctor named Ido rescued her from a scrap heap and rebuilt her with an amazingly powerful berzerker body. She has no memory, except for her panzer kunst fighting technique, which is the most powerful cyborg martial art ever known.
The movie is a combination of the first two graphic novels in the Gunnm or Battle Angel Alita series by Yukito Kishiro. It is set in the scrapyard, which is a city built in and from the garbage tossed down to earth from a floating city called zalem, or tiphares in the novels. In the story, Galley finds out that her savior, Ido, is a bounty hunting Hunter-Warrior and she miraculously rescues him from a bounty that almost kills him. The thrill of the fight and of the kill appeals to her so much that she becomes a hunter-warrior herself, against Ido's wishes. She ends up having to fight a huge and nasty brain eating junkie named Grewicica who was made by Chiren, Ido's ex-partner from when they lived up in zalem. Chiren didn't exist in the novels, but she was necessary for a more interesting movie. Galley also falls in love with a boy named Yugo, who is so maniacally obsessed with his dream of getting to zalem that he goes into the business of spine theft to pay for a nonexistent pass to get there. It is all a scam created by the factory's owner (he's the main authority figure), Mr. Vector.
This is an amazing story of love, life, and loss. The art and character design are incredible. Galley's cybernetic body is obviously mechanical, but very beautiful nonetheless. The animation is amazing, and the fight sequences are unforgettable. Once you see the movie, you can't help but get into the nine-part graphic novel series, which is incredible. Honestly, as amazing as the movie is, the graphic novels make it look pathetic. Take my advice and get into it! Yukito Kishiro is a genius!",1030838400,5,1937,4.633720930232558

There have been a few that I liked (Akira, Ghost in the Shell, one short featurette called  Presence) but for the most part I find anime to be a mixed lot.  I saw  ""Battle Angel"" on a dubbed-English VHS, and I felt it to be  confusing and poorly edited.  Granted, it is based on a popular manga, but  the film-makers probably tried to jam in too much information into one  hour's worth of animation.  The end-result doesn't make a lot of sense and  doesn't leave much room for adequate character development.  However, the  basic plotline in these 2 episodes shows a lot of potential; I think they  might hold more relevance to the viewer if he has read the manga on which  they're based.  It is a pity that no further episodes were filmed or that  Battle Angel wasn't allowed to develop over more episodes rather than  getting condensed into one short hour.
The animation seems about on par  with most short subject anime I've seen.  Also, try to see the subtitled  version, not the dubbed version.  Dubbing always seems to make films seem  cheesy, for some reason.",963792000,,1124,4.542713567839196

Anyone who has read the manga will immediately notice a few things. First of all, there are several different titles. The Japanese manga is titled Gunnm, while the American version is called Battle Angel  Alita. This anime is simply entitled Battle Angel. This two-part series is  based on the first two volumes of the manga, however there are several  changes. In the manga, the main character is called Alita, but she has been  renamed ""Gally"" in the anime. Also, the mysterious floating city  has changed from Tiphares to Zalem. Outside of this, it follows the stories  from the manga, but has been altered to fit into two half-hour  episodes.
At its core, Battle Angel is a story of love, hope, and  heartbreak. The story blends lightning-paced action, emotional drama, and  compelling mystery. What struck me was that it pulls it off so seamlessly.  The flow is nearly perfect, and not once did my suspension of disbelief  wane in the slightest.
The character are simply excellent. No one seems  ""fake"", for they all have realistic traits and flaws. This  heightens their believability and makes it easier to become attached to  them. One thing I noted is that Gally is not your typical anime android.  While from the neck up she looks human, the rest of her body is very  mechanical. This is a welcome break from the traditional prosthetic  ani-babes which plague many other titles.
The art is very good, capturing  the grittiness of the scrap yard perfectly. The animation is also pretty  decent, especially during the action sequences.
If there is anything to  complain about it's that this series is far too short. The manga version is  very extensive, and this series could easily have been a couple dozen  episodes in length. The short length also leaves little room for all the  answers to the questions posed. Fans will have to turn to the manga for a  complete revelation of all the secrets behind Gally.
Overall, this is a  rare gem of an anime. A dark, depressing sci-fi world with superb  characters and an excellent storyline. I recommend this to any fan of  science fiction",957052800,24,2103,4.834269662921348

Although it didn't live up to my highest expectations, the movie did focus on Gally's strive to find her individuality and it marked hope in a futuristic world gone bad.  I believe  it focuses a lot on what makes a human human and it should be seen more for  the themes.  The Animation isn't bad at all, in fact, excellent in my  opinion.  I am a huge fan of Anime and buy it like crazy.  This isn't the  highest on my list (compared to Macross, Ninja Scroll, and Maps), but it's  likeable.",956707200,,517,4.183673469387755

I feels as though the animator did not wish to spend  the time making the movie as great as it could have been (like substituting  action and battle scenes for blasts of light and shots of blood on walls).  Aside from these little things, it is nice to see the characters come to  life and kick booty.
I recommend this movie to any that are interested or  are new to the series, but for the avid psycho fans (like me) don't expect  to be as blown away like in the books.",956361600,,637,4.258333333333334

The DVD offers some bonuses that are worth the extra bucks, but it's still the basics that made this  anime impressive that will attract viewers. First, the storyline is not too  complicated, so don't think you'll be pondering the meaning of life after  watching the movie. I'll admit, I think it was a big mistake to try to  shove everything in your face in such a short period of time. The  characters seem to just merely be friends five minutes into the movie, but  then become lovers two minutes later. All that aside, what really makes  this anime shine, however, is the realistic world and fight scenes that  encompass what should've been a longer movie. The characters are loveable  in their own way (Note- avoid the dubbed version and switch to the orignal  dialouge to see what I mean)and they leave each their own mark of tragedy  at the end.

828076,3,6304256582,"The origonal name of Alita was far better, but that's beside the point.  In the future the planet is a wasteland.  A scientist finds part of a cyborg body and has the bright idea of rebuilding her, unaware that she is  far more than her delicate frame would have you believe.
To make this  film the film makers took the first two Alita books, threw them in the fire  and glued back together whatever was left.  They have completely destroyed  a fascinating and inteligent story just so they could pack it in to an  hour.  If you're a fan of the books avoid at all costs.
However, if you  are unfamiliar with the books then this does in fact make a nice little  action flick.

Based on the manga written by Yukito Kishiro. Battle Angel is an action anime with sci-fi elements that manages to be a lot more than a bloody spectacle. Battle Angel examines many themes. Themes consisting of love, hope, freedom, obsession, and the thin line between good and evil. The anime succeeds in meshing all of these concepts together with a coherent storyline, character development, and action without making anything seem artificial. What makes it so impressive, is that it's pulled off in a mere two episodes with a 25 minute run time each; while you have many anime with 12 times the episodes completely incapable of doing this Despite everything it does right though, there is so much room left for improvement.

First, beginning with the setting; The world this story takes place in is very interesting. Scrap Iron City is a cesspool of a community. It's filthy, dangerous, and depressing, in other words it's hell. Floating above it is the city called Zalem. Not much information is given on this supposed heaven, but one thing for sure is that some people are desperate to get there in hopes of living the good life. They're so driven by ambition they become consumed by it, and they're willing to do anything to make the dream a reality.

The characters are very well used in pushing this segment of the story. Their personalities reflect the misery in the city. When viewing things from their perspective it's easy to relate to their plight. Especially, one character who apparently tasted the life on Zalem at one point. I feel this was a good call on the writers part. Simply because this allows the viewer to understand that life on Zalem isn't a myth. Therefore, the character development is definitely a strong point. Gally is by far the most interesting of the characters due to her carefree personality and mean streak when called for.

Battle Angel seems to be more aimed at the thinking person to me, but action fans will get something out of it as well. The battles are very good, and even very brutal at times with some imaginative and well planned out scenes. The animation definitely brings out the best in the fights. They're very fluid without the slightest bit of jumpiness. For a 1993 OVA, the visuals are impressive. The artwork ranges from average to great. Special attention was paid to Gally when displaying all of her emotions. Many times her face told her story without the use of dialogue.

The soundtrack is decent with the right music for the right moods. I will mention that the ending theme Cyborg Mermaid performed by Kaori Akima has a very nice melody with some nice vocals. As far as the sub and dubs are concerned. I don't have a problem with neither.

The anime isn't without its flaws. The biggest problem with the series is the length. Although some things are wrapped up, questions are still left hanging and the viewer will be left wanting more. This is one of those titles that deserved better treatment but never got it. This is definitely a title that should be remade.

Overall, Battle Angel is a very good watch. It has compelling characters, good plot, and nice action scenes. There's a bit of nudity and sexual content yet nothing too graphic despite knowing something went on or is going on. I only recommend this title to the most die hard anime fans. Casual fans will probably feel like their time was wasted after seeing it.

Pros: Very good action scenes, nice animation and artwork, well developed characters

Cons: Too short, unanswered questions",1407456000,,4365,4.76953642384106
