8269679,5,B0018EHXF2,"I watched her ride live.  I was impressed at her knowledge level and her ability to stay on a troubled horse that had been someone else's problem until she got on it.  She settled him down pretty good given it was at the Sacramento horsemen's expo with LOTS of people around the arena and Craig Cameron and Chris Cox were in the arena with her.  She was highly endorsed by these two gentlemen.
She was also very polite personally but that doesn't have anything to do with the video.  She said ""Canter with Confidence"" was her best selling video.  So I got it.  I am VERY IMPRESSED. Easy to understand...there are a couple of bloopers I believe but 99.9% of the video was so helpful.  She tells you that the video is NOT a substitute for professional instruction with a horse and instructor but this video will save you a ton of money if you watch it ten times THEN go get a lesson.",1470355200,,881,4.335365853658536
