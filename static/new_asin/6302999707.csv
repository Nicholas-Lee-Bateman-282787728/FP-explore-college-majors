7833748,5,6302999707,"Norman Rockwell has always been one of my favorite artists.  This PBS documentary is very well done.

From still shots of his portraits, to interviews with the people that new Rockwell best, (including his assistant, and fellow art schoolmates) you really get a feel for the wonderful artist.

Norman Rockwell wasn't just a painter, he was a very gifted story teller.  Each of his painting told a story, or at least made you think of one as you viewed it.

To sum up Rockwell in just one word, it would have to be ""America"".  He truly had his finger on the pulse of the every changing times, then skewed them into a world he wanted to live in.

There is great behind the scenes footage of Rockwell working away.

Top notch narration by Mason Adams (Think ""With a name like Smuckers, it has to be good).

Erma Bombeck also gives her opinion of selected Rockwell works, as well as the man himself.

If you are a fan of Rockwell this is a must see.

Happy Watching!",1218240000,4,962,4.409090909090909
