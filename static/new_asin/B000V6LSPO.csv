8216665,5,B000V6LSPO,This summer love story was both sexy and funny. It's eroticism was as gripping as the fits of laughter it elicited from its more comedic scenes..great job!!!!!!!!!!,1390176000,,164,5.111111111111111

8216667,4,B000V6LSPO,"A man becomes obsessed with a school girl . That's the basic plot . This movie rolls along at a steady pace . Obsession , not just infatuation or liking but obsession . In this movie you see the decline of a man into a hell of his own creation . Sora Aoi who plays the school girl is a good actress .The cover of dvd , its just to get you in to buy or was that me ? The actual film is a lot more than the cover . Its a good story , well written and acted , with interesting pieces , unexpected moments of caring .",1378080000,,513,3.672727272727273

8216669,3,B000V6LSPO,"the film tells the story a middle aged man, you knw the type, small chubby and balding and his obsession with a pretty schoolgirl. its all a bit sad really but quite amusing in places leading up to the tragic ending.  having said all that its well made and quite cnvincing with some truly cringing moments. worth a watch.",1231372800,9,321,4.440677966101695
8216670,2,B000V6LSPO,"I bought this not knowing what to expect. I got a fairly decent story. This movie is better suited for rental and not one I'd recommend buying. The sex, what little there is, is muted to the point of almost being nonexistant. It primarily revolves around an otherwise ordinary guy who starts fantasizing over a particular girl. The fantasies become an obsession on which he acts. This movie is not pleasant to watch by any means, but still the director managed to film it in a rather bland manner, in which everything is muted.

8216671,5,B000V6LSPO,"Let me just tell you now. This DVD contains absolutely no nudity. However, saying this; the story itself is very intersting. I have been to Japan around 15 times, and am married to a beautiful Japanese woman. The movie pretty much tells you how life is surrounding the men in their perverted state of love and lusts.
 It is about an older man who has a very large crush for a high school girl (who in real life as they say is the Jenna Jameson of Japan porn). He self medicates himself as men do in any nation; if you know what I mean. He doesn't know how to approach her, until one day it drives him totally insane and he takes that final step. He finds her on the streets and hands her a present which has a hidden one way transistor radio in it. Upon the girls telling how gross the man is as he is listening, it drives him even more coocoo. So he get's on the train with her and as they travel, he holds a knife to her back and begins to feel her up, until he is accidently stabs her.
 He hope of the train and tries suicide, and fails. But, he ends up her neighbor in the hospital, but she doesn't know it is him because of a curtain between them. They become fast friends, until....
 It is worth the cost and very entertaining. Gross, sad, funny, and entertaining.",1205366400,37,1270,4.154471544715447
