8636473,5,B00HVJFQ7K,"Who Knew Russell Brand was a thoughtful - thought provoking - bright individual. Plus! He's a very funny stand-up comedian as well! Russell Brand takes you through some of his personal experiences as well as telling you who his heroes are and why. Along the way you learn why he quit taking drugs and just how (bleeping) well-read he is!! To be sure, he is still a foul-mouthed, gross orator but he gets the job done!

He never seems to stumble or forget his train of thought. He doesn't flub any of his jokes and seamlessly threads the whole evening together without missing a beat. You know he scripted the whole thing--yet---it seems so fluid, almost a complete stream of consciousness.

Bravo for him. With this performance Russell puts the nail in the coffin of his movie career (and thank god for that). The world could use another John Lennon. This is Russell Brand as you've never seen him before. Very well done mate!",1426723200,,926,4.640243902439025
8636474,3,B00HVJFQ7K,"I was a fan of Brand's from the beginning- funny at the hyperactive speed of light, like Robin Williams but even more so.  In early guest appearances here his off-the-cuff command of the language and quick wit were astonishing (shades of Dudley Moore).  He was also humble and I found that endearing.  OK, so it was an act, I STILL liked him.  But I HATE the gratuitous designed-to-shock sexual elements of his stand-up routine.

***SPOILER ALERT*** The comedy, taking the mickey out of himself, lamely (hilariously) likening himself to Gandhi, Malcolm X, Che Guevara and Christ, was inspired in many ways- as were his incisive observations on martyrdom, advertising, capitalism, and politics.  But WHY must they be punctuated with irrelevant and purely gratuitous sexual references-  to screwing women, analingus, anal sex, masturbating, gizz, sex with animals (including his CAT), etc.?  I found them unnecessary, distracting and CREEPY.  Likening Malcolm X's masterful ability to quell a riot and disperse a crowd by simply raising his hand, to Russell JERKING OFF in public?

He's written extensively about his sexual addiction/obsession (I read his autobiography, awful, in the same vein).  Though aware of his problem, he cannot control, inhibit or censor himself.  It's NOT of the same ilk as Richard Pryor making fun of himself after setting himself on fire smoking crack- he was in recovery and the comedy was after the fact- self-disclosing, hilarious, and even moving, inspiring.  Brand is still in the throes of his delusions/obsessions- he's BRAGGING, trying to impress and shock like some 13-year-old, pathetic.  The LAST thing I want to see are his gyrations and gangly pelvic thrusts.  Moreover, his comedy IMO would be much-improved if he could CONTAIN himself.  Time to grow up.

A closely related gripe is the sexism of many of his comments, using the ""C"" word liberally and other words derisive of women descriptively and to ridicule others.  He's smart enough not to do it, and it smacks of hostility towards women.  [Added later: curious because elsewhere Brand seems sincerely admiring of/respectful towards women.]  Were this not the case he would give equal time to gender neutral (e.g., words for the anus or excrement) or ""masculine"" derisive terms (bollocks, for example, and obscene euphemisms for the penis)- but he doesn't.  You needn't be Freud for that to stand out like a sore thumb- indeed, to cotton on to the subtext (anger, self-belittling) that underpins nearly every bit, he continually debases himself.  His routine is one big cry for help.

I found Brand's choice of facts to include about Gandhi's relations with his wife a little odd.  He mentioned that Gandhi married her at 13.  What he didn't say was that for years she pleaded with him for sex, was devastated by his decision to become celibate, after they'd enjoyed a satisfying sex life and had two children.  After making that decision Gandhi regularly had young nude girls brought to his bed, slept with them naked to test his resolve and self-control (!).  Lots of comic possibilities THERE, but maybe partly because no sex took place, and Brand couldn't gyrate accordingly, instead, of all the stories involving Mrs. Gandhi, he chose the one that involved Gandhi KILLING her (denying her medication that would've saved her life).  UGH.  THEN, he likens that act to it being preferable for his wife, rather than he, going downstairs and confronting an intruder, and being murdered in the process.  Tee-hee.  ""I can get ANOTHER f***ing wife!""  A long way to go for THAT.  And WHY??

At the end Brand speaks to how wonderful women are, but then spoils it a bit by adding: ""I HAVE to say that or I won't get laid after the show!""  Perhaps those who live vicariously through Russell Brand and envy his many assignations with women find his braggadocio heartening but for me it's just sad, and mars both his comic genius and his humanity.  I think others are so bedazzled by his machine-gun wit, verbal virtuosity, and potent charm that they overlook the rest.  I like him a lot, I wish he'd get his act together in more ways than one.",1424563200,3,4133,4.963609898107714

8636478,5,B00HVJFQ7K,"I like the guys show, it is funny, I came to see funny, and it is nice he throws in some of his life experience being disillusioned by the main stream, and tries to teach a bit of philosophy, kinda get up stand up, wake the BLEEP up style, in your face style!  The Christians won't like him, being all sexual, anti God, pro new age hippie earth worship, but who gives a BLEEP about what they think right!  Good show!
