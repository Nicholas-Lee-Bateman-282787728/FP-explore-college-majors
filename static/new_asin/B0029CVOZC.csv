8357722,5,B0029CVOZC,"One could argue this is perhaps the sexiest and most beautifully photographed films of its genre - just what genre that is perhaps is not quite easy to be clear about. However, it is rated in my country as 'Highly Sexualised Nudity', which I find somewhat misleading. It is so less harmful to viewers than 99% of the stuff that gets a more relaxed rating, one only wonders what the censors are thinking sometimes. This film is not going to encourage troubled teenage males to go out and do something criminal.  It is much more likely to leave them in a somewhat dreamy state yearning to be near and dear to such extraordinarily beautiful women - something, for example, that 'The Dude' in The Big Liebowski would 'dig, Man'.  Of course, the censors seem to get their moral knickers in a twist much more with tasteful (in this case, artistic) nudity than they do with gut-wrenching and degrading violence (in my country anyway). There is mostly nudity, with extraordinarily curvaceous and beautiful women either dressing or (mostly) undressing and in various poses, but 'highly sexualised'? I doubt that. Either way, I was spellbound.  The photography and method of presentation varies a little in quality in my opinion during the film - most of the scenes are beautifully staged and shot, while one or two others are infuriatingly clunky (do we need to see shots as the cameraman bumps his way to the bathroom? - that seemed to suggest a slight inference of 'the voyeur making his way through the house', which lowered the tone a touch), while one is so 'arty' we don't get to see much (for example, the other side of wet, steamed-up glass is not perhaps the best way to, ahem, view things...). I think this film is elevated far higher and aims far higher compared to, being the only example that springs to mind, a Playboy film, but making that analogy is unfair as that is not what this film is about at all.  There is virtually no focus on the women's most intimate areas, if I can put it that way. A fine line is somewhat crossed, though, with one of the later scenes where the nude model puts on some horse-riding inspired gear that comes a little close to an 'artistic' bondage session and starts lightly hitting herself on the backside while atop a lovely looking saddle (which, of couse, was what I was focussing on...), The film, overall, though, is like nothing I have ever seen. Celebrating the sheer beauty and attractiveness of admittedly mostly young women? Definitely.  Exploitative? No, although the French seem always to escape that tag, whether it be in a period drama or horror-thriller. Overall, I feel that I made a great purchase of something quite unique. I can only hope Herve will release '2008' and '2009' titles. Over to you, Herve.",1249516800,,2759,4.703933747412008
