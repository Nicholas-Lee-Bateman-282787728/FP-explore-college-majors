7927539,3,B00004YRJU,It's not bad but it just got stupid for me after the first 20 minutes that I had to turn it off.  The tall lama monk is annoying and the other weird characters like some short midget dudes that fly around is kind of lame.  It relies more on special camera tricks rather than straight combat scenes.  Like how people teleport and stuff.,1344211200,,335,4.285714285714286
7927540,5,B00004YRJU,"As a child, if you watched Kung Fu theater on Saturday's and enjoyed it, this is the movie for you.  This movie is by far one of the worst Kung Fu movies ever made, and I mean that in the best possible sense.  It has all the intangibles for a great Kung Fu movie--unbelieveable Kung Fu action, bad sound effects, bad editing, and bad overdubs.  The plot revolves around a pirate known as The Master Wu, who has surrounded himself with the best fighters from China and Vietnam.  If you only watch the beginning when they are all introduced, you will be hooked.  This band of fighters terrorize China during the Ming dynasty.  Through their terror, they end up killing someone's father, and as we all know in Kung Fu, that means sworn revenge.  The movie is non-stop action from then on, and sure the plot line gets blurry, but that's not the point.  You have to see this movie to believe it.  With characters like the Ghost Killer and Blind Swordsman, you can't help but love it.  So, if you liked ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but thought the cinematography and editing was too nice for Kung Fu, then try this movie out.  You'll agree that ""72"" is truly the best of the worst.",987638400,8,1180,4.4672897196261685
