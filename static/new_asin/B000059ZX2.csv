1410217,5,B000059ZX2,"A long overdue release on DVD of this controversial thriller. Filmed at a time when the IRA were still engaged in terrorist activities on mainland Britain the film caused a minor scandal by including newsreel footage of the Royal Family, making it appear as if they are part of the unfolding climax. The film was refused distribution by all major distributing chains in the UK, and also banned by local Councils from being shown in their areas. It had a limited release in the UK and came out on VHS years later. The plot requires a major suspension of disbeleif, but the film works well within it's tight budget, the early scenes in Northern Ireland set a powerful opening for the following tale of revenge. An excellent supporting cast of major English charachter actors add authority and distinction to minor parts, Lee Remick is memorable in an underdeveloped role of an old freind who shelters Hennessy, there is an excellent soundtrack by the underated John Scott, and Rod Steiger delivers one of his most understated and nuanced performances in the title role, reminding us what an outstanding actor he was in his prime. The film is a minor gem.",1314316800,6,1152,4.793969849246231
1410218,4,B000059ZX2,"Thanks to the huge success of Warner Brothers' 'Movies on Demand' program, other majors have jumped on this lucrative wagon and launched one of their own, bringing us movies that might not otherwise see the light of day - though this 1975 British thriller from erstwhile Hammer director Don Sharp did get a release on VHS in the mid to late '80s. This nice looking, widescreen edition from MGM is a vast improvement over that pan and scan effort, resulting in a much more enjoyable viewing experience.
Hennessy (Rod Steiger) is a demolition expert and former member of the Irish Republican Army who no longer believes in the violence in Northern Ireland as a means of achieving the end of British rule there. He spurns attempts by a former comrade (the always magnificent Eric Porter)to persuade him back into the fight or, failing that, at least supply the organization with the explosives his job gives him access to.
Fate comes between Hennessy and his commitment to peace when his wife and daughter are accidentally gunned down by a British soldier during an attack on his unit by rock-throwing kids and an IRA sniper. Hennessy, believing their deaths were deliberate, vows to avenge them by blowing up none other than the Queen and every member of Parliament during its opening ceremony.
Both the IRA and Scotland Yard get wind of this, setting in motion the attempts by both sides to capture Hennessy that are the movie's raison d'etre - the IRA because the slaughter would turn public opinion against them forever, and the police for obvious reasons.
The movie makers incorporated film of an actual opening of Parliament that appears to show the Queen and others in the House of Lords reacting to Hennessy being thwarted in his attempt at mass assassination. It's brilliantly edited and was retained despite the objections of Buckingham Palace and Rank's (if I remember right) refusal to give it a wide release in Britain. The other cinema giant there refused to exhibit it on the same grounds, consigning the movie to virtual oblivion.
The cast is a veritable who's who of American and British talent, and includes Lee Remick as the widow of an IRA friend of Steiger, an excellent Richard Johnson as a ruthless Special Branch cop, Peter Egan as his assistant, and the sublime Trevor Howard as their boss. An excellent supporting cast includes Patrick Stewart in his first film role.",1313020800,3,2390,4.874692874692875
1410219,5,B000059ZX2,"Hennessy was a very effective thriller that dealt with the unfortunate events around the life of a simple man who lost his family by a bomb, focusing all his energies in order to kill the Queen of England as a personal revenge. Rod Steiger proves us why he was one of the most extraordinary North American actors in years, visibly overlooked and wasted by the American cinema.

This film may be proudly cited among the three best suspense thrillers of the first half of that decade, joined with ""Black Sunday"" and ""The day of the jackal.""",1193184000,3,538,4.604166666666667

*Plot and ending analyzed*

If it wasn't for the insipidly idiotic scenes, namely the ending, this would have been a little better. As it stands, the assassination plot should have been carried out with relative ease. Add a violent New Scotland Yard detective, who I may add is entirely dull, and he puts an end to Rod Steiger's complot and it further sinks into incredulity. Rod Steiger wouldn't be my first choice to play some competent detonation man on the lam. He makes plenty of mistakes to have both the IRA and New Scotland Yard detectives find him.

The Day of the Jackal (1973) also had a similar ending and at least that was better throughout the film.

Rod Steiger plays some Irish bloke who served in the North African Campaign of the Second World War, but comes back home a few years later to a divided Ireland. The IRA wants him for a job but he refuses, out of principal he says, but then his wife and kid get gunned down by a young trigger squeezing Royal Military Police lad who took a rock hit to the mug and then Rod Steiger plans a hit on Queen Elizabeth II. The IRA look for him since if he ices Queen Elizabeth England will destroy the IRA.

It all seems a bit on the weak side.",1476662400,,1285,4.355648535564853

This begins in Belfast Northern Ireland. Armored vehicles patrol the streets. A man sets explosives to destroy two factory chimneys. Another man stops his car to ask for help in obtaining gelignite. But Hennessey puts his family first now. Outside young men throw rocks at soldiers, who shoot back with rubber bullets. Gas bombs are then thrown at the rioters. One soldier is hit by a stone, falls, and shoots his machine gun at the rioters. A passing woman with a young girl are among the dead. There is a party in a house, people sing. Its a wake for the dead woman and her daughter. Hennessey left on a flight for London, he left a message. Two men meet him and give him a ride. There is a struggle in the car and a shot! Hennessey abandons the car. [Not wiping fingerprints?] Nial goes to a dress shop to meet a woman. Scotland Yard found the body and investigates.

They learn Hennessey is in London and investigate Toomey. That car wasn't reported stolen, it may have come from a used car lot. Hennessey needs a place to stay. A key under a doormat? Is there a threat to Parliament? Tourists visit the House of Lords. The Queen will visit to make a speech. Police detectives visit a garage and find a man sleeping in a car. A young man is beaten to get him to talk. One man is recognized, Mr. Hollis questions him. Hennessey visits a man for help. Then he watches a funeral on television for the seven Belfast martyrs. The IRA learns Hollis is on to Hennessey. An explosion in Parliament will cause the whole world to hate the IRA so they must eliminate Hennessey. Hollis is a man of action who makes things work. Cobby tells Hollis the IRA wants to get Hennessey too. Someone attacked a guard at a quarry for explosives, 30 pounds of gelignite were stolen! Hennessey visits the home of the anti-pollution activist and leaves a note.

Kate suspects Hennessey is on a job, he isnt, he says. Cobby spots Hennessey and calls his superiors, they search the dress shop and the living quarters. Nial calls about his missing tape recorder. He returns, but Kate warns him! Shots are fired The chase is on. Scotland Yard warns the Government about the threat.

Nial runs away, Hollis pursues him. There is a shot then an explosive ending! Alls well that ends well.

This is a great suspense story, sort of like the kind Alfred Hitchcock used to make. It tells about the troubles in Northern Ireland and their costs. John Buchan wrote The Thirty-nine Steps in 1915; this adventure story was adapted to many movies. Its plot is echoed in this story. At times the story is slow moving but that is needed to carry the story forward.",1476316800,,3521,4.512539184952978

Clips of the Queen were used to great effect, to make it look like she actually participated in the project. Apparently she was annoyed by the use of her video images.",1439164800,,270,4.313725490196078

7934751,4,B000059ZX2,"We need more story tellers like Richard Johnson today.  No blam special effects... just good story telling that becomes enhanced by great actors; Trevor Howard (RIP), Rod Steiger (RIP), Lee Remick (RIP) and the list goes on.

The music soundtrack could have been better, perhaps John Barry.  Richard Johnson also chose a close friend of mine for location manager, Stuart Freeman who worked at giving the story a unique but true image for the screen.

HENNESSY still stands as a story that is beleivable today.  There is an IRA and there is an IRA.  Which one would would you be with...?  HENNESSY, just like Harry's Game is a great English classic.

7934752,4,B000059ZX2,"This thriller bears more than a passing resemblance to 'The Day of the Jackel', in plot development and in some specific shots. Which is all to the good, because the other film is a terrific production. This one is not far behind and continues to surprise just when you think it has played all its cards. The cast, including Rod Steiger, Lee Remick and Trevor Howard (the latter two in comparatively small roles), is top-notich. The exterior locations and use of newsreel footage (watch for the Queen's 'reaction' during the climactic scene - no wonder the producers had to run a disclaimer that the film was not made with the assistance of the royal family) both lend the story great impact and drama. The only caveat, for me, is that we are not told enough about the main character to be able to comprehend why he has embarked on his extreme plot - apart from his grief. Some clues are played in as we go along, but he needed more development up front.",1336780800,2,954,4.520231213872832

Also the hardware ie tv`s dvd players etc are now as good as the disc`s they are playing so you can enjoy the movie`s as they should be,one to buy now,very good dvd,and is in fullscreen,which helps on a large LED tv.",1314403200,,704,4.2611940298507465
