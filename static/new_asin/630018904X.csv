The senator being control by high government dark forces who are setting him up for president through murder of another canidate. Then a magician/wizard comes along and feels sorry for the family and child and decides to cure the boy. This is then where the story takes off and bcomes more exciting every minute. A mystical-fantasy based on the story of Rasputin and his influence over the royal Czar's court and his death is told in a new way in this modern version of the Rasputin story of the 18th century. A good watch if you just love fantasy. Stars Robert Powell as the Magician, Divid Hemmings the husban, and Carmen Duncan as the wife and Mark Spain as the sick child. This Movie also carried the titles ""Harlequin"" and ""The Minister's Magician""
I really enjoyed this movie which the first time I watched it was 1980 under the title ""Harlequin"".",1278460800,2,1010,4.679775280898877
222598,4,630018904X,"Fascinating, dark study of a political family seduced by the powers of a traveling magician who befriends their ill son. The story works well on that level, and the acting is certainly passable enough to be entertaining.

Even more fascinating when one realizes that this is a retelling of the historical plot of the fall of the Czar of Russia! In history, Nicholas (Nicky in this film) and Alexandra (Sandy) had and extremely ill son, Alexander (Alex) and allowed the ""Mad Monk"" Gregory Rasputin (Gregory Wolfe) into the family with his promises of a cure for the the boy. Viewed on this level, this interesting enough B-movie become a fascinating study in parallels. Well worth a watch and some time to enjoy!",1240272000,3,711,4.827868852459017

I couldn't remember the title but, I did a lot of research and figured it out. I was more than delighted when I saw this and could purchase it on DVD! I am incredibly happy that the story was just as riveting to me in my 50's as it was when I was a kid.

Deliver was fast. The case came in perfect condition. All was excellent.",1486771200,,437,3.8555555555555556
7804637,4,630018904X,"Great movie with a great story, in spite of the fact that it may be a little dated around the edges when compared to today's CGI effects-laden films and for today's audiences possessing attention span-deficit. Nice DVD with a decent transfer.",1481760000,,242,4.926829268292683
7804638,4,630018904X,"Australian cinema is an interesting case. Here, almost everyone speaks with British accents yet the film takes place vaguely in somewhere resembling the USA complete with those congressional senators instead Parliamentarians like the local flavor would suggest. It doesn't play either like they're unhappy that they are from Australia. It's almost like they chose to really steer into an alternate dimension feeling.

The plot is also a big part of this. It's not quite a horror, political, sleaze, suspense, etc film. It's got bits and pieces of everything as a Rasputin type character slowly worms his way into the lives of everyone. It's creepy and filled with a strange Gabriel Garica Marquez styled magical realism but made even stranger by the not quite classy and not quite exploitative nature of the movie. Dark Forces is simply it's own animal.

It's a great pick up. The cover doesn't really sell the movie properly. Makes it look like a goofy children in peril film. If I had to nail it down, it feels like Joseph Losey's The Servant or Pier Palo Pasolini's Theorema if you dropped the childishness of the poorly executed political themes of those films and replaced it with more suspense that gets more to the core of those 2 films than their original film makers did.",1479686400,,1280,4.894009216589862

7804645,4,630018904X,"The sickly son of a state senator is miraculously healed by a traveling magician, Gregory, who helps to cure the boy of his illness and his mother of her loneliness as he eases his way into the family's good graces. Meanwhile, the senator is caught up in a sinister ploy for power, which Gregory looks to stop. This modern reworking of the Rasputin tale is filled with added mystery and intrigue as director Simon Wincer bends the limits of reality in DARK FORCES. At its heart, DARK FORCES is a political allegory dealing with absolute power and corruption, but the intertwining themes of family drama and pure fantasy make it easily accessible for fans of varying genres. Wincer has assembled an excellent cast, with a paranoid David Hemmings as Senator Rast, Carmen Duncan playing his disillusioned wife, and the talented Mark Spain as their young son. Most impressive of all is Robert Powell in the lead, whose charming and devious performance as Gregory Wolfe never quite reveals his character's true intentions. Drawing additional influence from the Australian shocker PATRICK and THE OMEN, DARK FORCES includes several flashy special effects and gory murders as well. As yet undiscovered by many Horror fans, DARK FORCES stands as one of Australia's strongest entries in the genre.
