6129937,4,B00H3L827W,I decided not to use this for my small group study at church because it was too depressing for the group.  This would work well for a bereavement group or for people that had suffered a tremendous loss (such as loss of a child).  There is a message of forgiveness at the end of the movie which is very powerful.  I have not done the study yet but have watched the entire film to preview it before facilitating the study.,1400112000,6,420,4.225
6129938,5,B00H3L827W,Going through tough times from the perspective of the story of Joseph in the Old Testament. This study answers that question we all ask at some point in our lives. Some seem to have more than their share of suffering. But this study will bring you great understanding and comfort. I can't wait for the movie to be released.,1395705600,4,323,4.491525423728813

8629463,5,B00H3L827W,"This is an incredible PERSONAL Study into the deeply troubling aspect of pain that we endure in our lives. For watching at home by yourself or just your family, it is incredible.  I agree, for a group study it would be too disturbing and the deep things just aren't going to be given the respect, dignity and healing needed.  Nothing in this series should be taken lightly or like a cliche and in a group, I am afraid people would be too protective of their emotions and that is how it might end up.  This should be done earnestly and honestly.

Having done that, I found it an incredible journey.",1478304000,,597,4.4
8629464,5,B00H3L827W,This is a difficult subject handled in a fairly effective manner. I would recommend for more mature audiences.,1475280000,,110,5.166666666666667

8629466,5,B00H3L827W,"The most deep creative and amazing curriculum piece I've  ever seen! The production quality and acting was of big studio Hollywood quality.  Couple that with the teaching and warmth of Bob Russell and you have a real winner. It is not for the faint of heart or those who expect general vanilla church answers. It is Genuine, biblical and at times got wrenching. If you have a group that lives in the real world you have to use this.",1469664000,,432,4.455696202531645
8629467,5,B00H3L827W,My Sunday School class did this about a year ago.  My family recently experienced a tremendous loss and the lessons we learned here were truly valuable.  I'm going through it again to help me through the grieving process.  I'm also ordering a copy for my niece that lost her son.,1467849600,2,279,4.54
8629468,2,B00H3L827W,"Terribly disappointed in this video. Bought to do study in Sunday school, but decided not to because of extremely depressing content. Point a bit overdone. Usually a very big fan of Bob Russell's works and teachings. Would not recommend and would like refund if possible.",1456790400,,271,5.044444444444444

8629470,5,B00H3L827W,Used our other copy for a bible study group at church. Got this copy for a door prize after the study was over. Would recommend to anyone doing a group bible study. It gave me more understanding of how God could allow bad things in our lives but also made me want to know God more and to be closer to him.,1430611200,,305,3.935483870967742
