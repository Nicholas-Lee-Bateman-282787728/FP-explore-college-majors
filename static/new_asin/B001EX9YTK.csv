With very little Japanese animation arriving on blu-ray in the US, it's slim pickings for most fans, and even harder for adopters of this more expensive media to find something that's really worth a purchase that isn't a quick re-make of an old title or a new release.

Yukikaze was released two years back in Japan to moderate success. To sum it up without giving too much away, the series is about a military organization tasked with fighting an alien race that attacked planet earth through a giant portal created on the northern hemisphere linking the planets. Many years passed, and we find the battle still raging on the alien planet while the humans are growing complacent on their world.... blah blah blah in comes the protagonist of the story... blah dee blah he's conflicted and has an emotional attachment to his aircraft... and then some other plot twists and characters thrown in the mix.  Overall, a very good story.

What really made a mark for the series was it's release on the blu-ray format.  The box set includes the complete series and an entire disc dedicated to hours of extras.  I've personally watched the extras disc and found it a great, if not slightly boring at times addition with very informative facts about the aircraft to include specifications, comparisons to real-world craft and character information.  Watch out for the ""technology expert"" speakers teeth.  Don't ask.

So, what about the actual series you ask?  Well, it's downright stunning in high definition.  The colors are rich and vibrant and make the effort the animators put into making the series that much more appreciated. The sound is beyond amazing and takes full advantage of a good 5.1 system.  Each disc has fully interactive menus with choices of either original Japanese language with subtitles or a dubbed English language.

The box which houses the blu-ray cases and informational booklet are very high quality and are great to show off.

While not rambling too much about the blu-ray, I'm going to put it bluntly:

Get this title. You will not be disappointed.  It's great for all audiences and will be a staple of your collection, guaranteed.",1232582400,11,2283,4.890909090909091
