6993485,3,B00SW92TKK,"The books were great and most of the DVD series were great. This series (which is the last by the way) is a mixed bag. The one story that dealt with witchcraft was a bit far out. The other four stories were mainly up to par with previous D&P series but I must say that the very early series were definitely the best since they were based on books written by Reginald Hill. Many of the later series were based on ""characters created by Reginald Hill"". Big difference. Overall the 11 series are worth owning if you are a fan of D&P and like the original books. Superintendent Andy Dalziel and Inspector Pascoe were a well matched pair of characters and they played well off each other. Sadly Reginald Hill died quite a few years ago and Warren Clarke (who plays Dalziel) died just last year (2014). They both will be missed as will the movies and the books.",1433548800,12,855,4.383647798742138

6993489,2,B00SW92TKK,"I love this series up until now.  The last disc was a real disappointment, not that the story was not good, because it was but I do hate it when it leaves you hanging at the end of the series.  If I had it to do again I would not buy this one, I would wait for the next one.  I will probably buy the next one if there is one.",1431043200,9,325,3.5492957746478875

6993497,2,B00SW92TKK,"Don't know who wrote these episodes, but they stunk.  We have all seasons and loved this show, but not this season.  The witch one was weird and stupid, but the last one was way out of character.  Asked my husband why they didn't come out with a pascoe series like they did with a lewis series, and the last episode showed us why they didn't.",1439164800,4,342,4.230769230769231

6993505,5,B00SW92TKK,"In my mind, one of the best Brit TV cop series.  I was saddened to learn of Warren Clarke's demise.  Not only did we lose a great actor, but this well done series will probably conclude with Mr. Clarke's absence.",1434931200,2,212,4.275

6993507,1,B00SW92TKK,"We have seen all the previous seasons of Dalziel and Pascoe. This series is an anomaly. The writers have made Dalziel very unsympathetic and unlikeable. I was frankly rooting for him to be killed or to emigrate. They have also been corrupted by US CSI-type graphics and overbearing ominous music. This is not the Dalziel and Pascoe of the first 10 seasons nor the type of Brit Detective show we love. Highly NOT recommended if you liked the first 10 seasons. Keep your memories clean.

Don't spend the money to get this turkey (I'm sorry, that's not fair to turkeys) of a season. AVOID at all costs. Good riddance to this Dalziel. (I know Warren Clarke passed away in 2014, but this isn't his fault - I blame the writers.) The final episode was so disgusting that I could not even watch it. If this were the first series, there is no way I would ever have purchased any more. Nuf said.",1434240000,16,885,4.462962962962963

8699516,5,B00SW92TKK,"In reading the customer reviews of ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" Season 11, I couldn't help but get the impression that the end of the series somehow betrayed the characters and its fans. So it was with some trepidation that I bought and watched it, only to be pleasantly surprised that the shows contained therein were of the same high quality as their predecessors. Over the passage of time, we were able to see past the gruff exterior of Warren Clarke's Andy Dalziel. His reaction to Peter Pascoe's near death was superbly played, but the fact that Dalziel reverted to his sometimes unpleasant demeanor should have come as no surprise. Colin Buchanan's Pascoe, with all of his challenges, was always the series' moral center. And the duo is a believable and all-too-human team right up to the last, nail-biter of a conclusion. As with most of the entries in the series, it is far from a comfortable conclusion, but ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" always emphasized how messy and heartbreaking life can be, especially for its all-too-human protagonists.",1510272000,3,1035,4.954022988505747
