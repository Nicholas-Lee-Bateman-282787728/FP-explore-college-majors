7805867,4,6300184463,"The Long Patrol is the second-best of Battlestar Galactica's one part episodes (second only to The Hand Of God, curiously unreleased on tape or DVD), combining humor with action and some clever twists.
Dirk Benedict  commands the role of Starbuck.  His love triangle with Athena (Maren  Jensen) and Cassiopeia (Laurette Spang) is captured in great fashion in an  impromptu double date on the Rising Star during Act One.  He is then  summoned to the Galactica for a probe into the galaxy in a new recon viper,  equipped with what Apollo (Richard Hatch) accurately described as ""a  voice-activated computer that can outfly anything the Cylons throw at  you.""  This Computer, Oral Response Acitvated is also capable of  driving pilots to madness, as Starbuck finds out in his banter with the  machine.
In his probe, Starbuck finds a prison colony, forgotten for  centuries, inhabited by the descendents of both the original prisoners and  their guards - and in which he finds a wall painting of the homeworld of  one prisoner, a homeworld that seems to be Earth.  But when one prisoner  (James Whitmore Jr.) steals his viper, it brings both Apollo and Boomer,  but also a Cylon patrol, which attacks the prison colony.
Though humor  permeates the episode (not only intentional in Starbuck's interplay with  his girlfriends as well as CORA, but unintentional in the laughable Irish  accents the prisoners and guards speak with), there is genuine tension,  reaching its apex in one of the show's finest scenes - Starbuck finds that  the cells are not locked, but the prisoners haven't the ability to free  themselves because they feel it is their destiny to be prisoners.
CORA  was partly inspired by Star Wars, and also by real life US Air Force  experiments with similar voice-acivated computers.  This angle raises some  questions - are other vipers equipped with CORA systems? (Presumably)  But  more important, if a computer can outfly anything (though Starbuck helps  talk CORA into outmaneuvering the Cylons), why can't the computerized  Cylons outfight the humans?  (As it is, this may have been a point Glen  Larson hoped would rub off on Standards & Practices at ABC, with whom  he was clashing.)
In any event, the episode stands as one of the show's  best.",945216000,19,2262,4.986559139784946
