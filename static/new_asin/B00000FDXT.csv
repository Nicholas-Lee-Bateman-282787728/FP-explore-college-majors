1211505,5,B00000FDXT,"This was one of my all-time favorite cartoons, along with the late 50's version of Felix the Cat (the Professor, Rock-Bottom & Master Cylinder were great) and Dick Tracy (Go-Go Gomez, Joe Jitsu & Hemlock Holmes were fantastic, as were the bad-guys) not to mention Gigantor, 8th Man, Speed Racer, Deputy Dawg and Kimba the White Lion, to name a few more. But the Mighty Hercules was right there at the top! Why they would only release about 20 of the episodes is beyond me. I'm sure they have access to all 128 episodes, so why not release them all? Does anyone know if they plan on doing this? If they are, I'll wait for the complete series. Otherwise, I guess I'll have to be content with only 1/6 of the total. But I know it will only leave me wanting more. Oh well!",1319241600,30,768,4.340277777777778

1211507,5,B00000FDXT,Hi. I just got this in the mail today. I was really surprised. Although it is not all the complete episodes it does have the wonderful credits and that great theme song by Johnny Nash for each episode. The remaster quality looks great to me. The colors and sound are vibrant- better than I remember the original. I think the episodes are in order or at least in sequence. Wow this was really a great buy for the price! Arrived in a bubble mailer but did not suffer any damage. I think any Mighty Hercules fan (or even new little fans) will really like this collection. There are 20- 5 minute episodes complete with credits before and after. I hope they make more like this. Now if the same company could make a Johnny Cypher collection that would be cool too. On the Retro-Cool-O-Meter it gets a 100! Fan boys unite! The Mighty Hercules is here again. Oh yeah.,1317772800,48,860,4.415094339622642
1211508,5,B00000FDXT,"If the time of 110 minutes is correct, than there should be about 22 episodes at 5 minutes long each. We shall see soon. 22 episodes is better than nothing, after waiting a half a lifetime to see this again!",1317340800,9,207,4.2
1211509,3,B00000FDXT,"I remember watching this show every morning before school and to finally be realeased on DVD is fantastic news to me.  I am somewhat concerned with the new price and possible minimalized content in this release, and I am obviously not alone.

There were 128 individual stories in the original run, each was approximately 5 minutes long.  BY my calculation, that would be 640 minutes - or 10 hours, 40 minutes.  This is a vast difference from the noted 110 minutes.

I hope that that details are in error, but considering the price I'm getting prepared for disappointment.",1317168000,6,571,4.785714285714286
1211510,4,B00000FDXT,"Glad to see that The Mighty Hercules is coming out, but concerned about the minimal content.  Sure, the price is cheap, but the program is also vintage as well.  I've also heard it's been released in other countries WITHOUT the theme or credits. That is absolutely not acceptable. That was a major part of what made this show was Johnny Nash's classic theme-it HAS to be included-NOTE that it's even quoted in the Amazon description!  What I've heard and seen from the imported releases, it looks and sounds amazing. I hope this package equals or surpasses them.",1313971200,9,562,4.77319587628866

1211595,4,B00000FDXT,"This was that random cartoon growing up where you'd watch it if you could find it.  But it seemed to never be on a the same time or was on really early in the morning so you often missed it.  Still a class if you grew up in the 80's and early 90's.
I always appreciate an episode list, so this DVD sets includes the following:

-Hercules comes to Earth

-The Sea Witch
-Hercules vs. Teron the Evil Spirit
-Hercules vx. The Hydra
-Hercules and the Stolen Ring
-Hercules and the Magic Arrows
-Daedalius kidnaps Helena
-Theft of the Magic Seal
-Double Trouble
-Hercules rescues Timon
-The Chair of Forgetfulness
-The Strength potion
-Hercules vs. the Hideous bird Beast
-Peagasus Kidnapped
-The Sea Beast
-Hercules outwits the Magician
-The Defiant Mask of Vulcan

1211632,4,B00000FDXT,"When I first saw these cartoon shorts on my black and white tv set in the 1960s I was just in my elementary school years. I didn't know about the theatrical history of animation and it's golden age of hand drawn cartoons! I did see the marvellous Walt Disney classics, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, PINOCCHIO, and FANTASIA which just blew me away in the theaters but I didn't know then that those animators would work at different studios and so many of the cartoon shorts made for theaters were worn, faded prints that I wouldn't see in colour until the 70's when my father bought our first colour tv set!

Many years later the warner cartoons featuring BUGS BUNNY and other looney Tunes stars would appear on tv in mint condition shorts and so the restoring of cartoons to high quality began as the video market expanded! And the invention of DVD made it much more affordable to get mass collections of both theatrical cartoons as well as tv cartoon series! So I have purchased all the 1960s Hanna Barbera action adventure  cartoon shows that  have the character designs from ALEX TOTH. SPACE GHOST, MIGHTY MIGHTOR, SHAZZAN etc. I have on DVD-R format!

And now I have THE MIGHTY HERCULES! Like the other tv cartoons I just mentioned I rediscovered MIGHTY HERCULES on You Tube where I could watch them in colour for the first time in at least a LONG time! And it became apparent to me how much the artists were influenced by the classic Max Fleischer SUPERMAN cartoons of the early 1940s! There are no voice credits on these cartoons which allowed different voice actors to voice the same characters in the cast. In most of these shorts the actors voicing Hercules sound very similar to Bud Collyer who voiced Superman in both the early radio show and the Fleischer SUPERMAN cartoons!

And seeing these cartoons in remastered colour Hercules toga has the same blue colour as Superman's tights and his belt has the same yellow and red as Superman's red S with the H in red surrounded by yellow! While the animation is low budget limited movement the characters strike good comic book poses which one can do with characters even in limited animation! And the remastering shows how good looking the artwork really is! When Bruce W. Timm created BATMAN the animated series the Fleischer SUPERMAN cartoons showed him the approch to follow! When he started making his SUPERMAN animated series he was having a hard time finding just how to draw SUPERMAN for his take on the Man of Steel.

Then he watched these HERCULES tv cartoons and said, ""Wow , look at him. Look at that face. That's Superman! I freezed framed it and drew him from that old Hercules cartoon and that became the way of nailing down his image in simplified animated form. That's where his face came from at least and after that he became and easier nut to crack!"" I'll keep that in mind the next time I watch Timm's SUPERMAN cartoon series! If you're a fan of these Hercules cartoons but haven't seen the Fleischer SUPERMAN cartoons then I strongly recommend you check out the Max Fleischer SUPERMAN 2-disc DVD set from Warner Home video(See my review on this set on amazon.com!) Made in spectacular FULL ANIMATION for movie theaters they really raised the bar on Superhero animation and are a VERY HIGH standard that all animators look up to! I give those Superman cartoons 5 stars!!

One reviewer here claimed that new voices replaced the original voices when these cartoons were remastered but that reviewer is mistaken! At times more then one voice actor has voiced the same character and the voices sound different! In the 1960s JONNY QUEST both Don Messick and John Stepheson voiced Dr. Benton Quest and their voice renditions of the same character sound distinctly different! In BATMAN TAS both Colin Clive and Efrem Zimmbaliat Jr.voiced Alfred the butler in that Bruce W. Timm series! So rest assured Hercules fans this IS the original sound track with crystaL clear stereo like sound and vibrant remasterd backrounds! Makes me yearn for hand crafted, hand painted cell days!

In the Hercules short titled SEA WITCH Willowmene has a more grotesque look to her then in the later shorts and her voice has a more wicked cackle. In the later shorts such as SEA BEAST her voice changed to a sexier raspy voice and her face was prettyied up to compete with the fair Helena!  Also notice that the parrot sitting on her shoulder is named ""Elvira""! The same name of a certain ""Mistress of the dark"" that hosted many bad, laughable horror movies both on tv and home video! And of course Willowmene bears a resemblance to that famous horror hostess as well! SEA BEAST has exciting action that is reminecent of Flischer's Superman short, THE ELECTRIC EARTHQUAKE with the underwater electric cables wrapping around Superman like the tentacles of the giant octapus wrapping around Hercules!! And the Jonny Nash song sounds GREAT on my external stereo speakers! While it's a low budget show it's a nice bargain at just $3.89!! With the cool picture quality it goes together nicely  with my remastered SPEED RACER episodes voiced by Peter Fernandez! I found it to be a surrprisingly good buy! Yay for both DVDs and remastering!!",1404691200,,5187,4.740576496674057

1211658,4,B00000FDXT,"What I remembered most about this series of short, animated adventures (about 5 minutes in length), was the catchy theme song by Johnny Nash! Still can't stop singing along when I hear it. On a par with the animation of the day, it was an enjoyable few minutes of escapism for a child home from school, many years ago. When I chanced upon this collection of material from the series (at a great price), I couldn't pass it up. Light on credits at the end, I still don't know who wrote the song that perfectly captured this immortal hero. Maybe one day.",1390176000,,551,4.411764705882353

1211660,3,B00000FDXT,"THE MIGHTY HERCULES: For cartoon fans of a certain age, TRANS LUX's cheaply animated made for TV series will be the HERCULES they most fondly remember, not DISNEY's sleek update or KEVIN SORBO's syndicated beefcake series. Based ever so loosely upon Greek mythology, this valiant son of ZEUS, aided by a power-bestowing ring, kept Mount Olympus safe from cackling evil wizard DAEDAULUS, scraggly sea witch WILHEMINE and the virtually impenetrable MASK OF VULCAN. Other regular characters included HERC's constant sidekick NEWTON, a well meaning but bungling centaur, beautiful damsel in distress HELENA and panpipe playing youngster TEWT. Each one of the 128 segments opened with JOHNNY (I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW) NASH's majestic theme song and climaxed with HERCULES carting off the baddie while shouting his trademark ""Olympia!"". Colorful and kid friendly without being silly, THE MIGHTY HERCULES was a pleasant alternative to the glut of cookie cutter cape-and-mask super heroes of the sixties.

Hercules and his sidekick fawn have to run down to earth to save the day, and do.  Sound and picture and color, all very good.  Cheaply-done animation, but effective.

Hercules is a great role model for young kids, he is physically very powerful but in every episode it is shown that Hercules only manages to defeat his enemies by using his brains in combination with his brawn. Hercules helps the common men and women of ancient Greece as well as helping kings and royalty.  He shows great compassion for people in trouble and selflessly helps , never asking for any reward.

Originally I recall it being telecast on our local NBC affiliate at 5 pm EST on Friday afternoons during 1963-64. The Trans-Lux company, previously known for its Felix the Cat cartoons from the late 50s, was responsible this gem. A year before Jonny Quest premiered on ABC in Sept 1964, this was an action cartoon in which violence was light compared to what would come about after Batmania would hit in January 1966 with Saturday morning cartoons beginning in Sept 1966, Space Ghost, etc. Hercules was given a magic ring by Zeus in or4der that his powers would be maintained whenever he came to Earth to help out those in distress.

When I saw this show as a kid, when the films were fairly new, the quality wasn't as good as you'll see here. And reruns I've seen throughout my life were old and faded prints. Somehow they've managed to find archived material that is in absolutely mint condition and/or lovingly restored it. The colour is rich and vibrant. The image quality looks as if the cartoon was produced yesterday, not nearly fifty years ago. Sound is remarkably crisp as well, given the means and budget with which it was originally made.

The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is because this should have been a complete box set with all 128 episodes, not just one disc with only about 1/4 of the episodes originally made. Love that they put all this effort into producing the disk but very disappointed it's not a complete set. Hopefully they will re-release the rest of them.",1332720000,9,1014,4.633333333333334

So last night I hauled out my copy and played an episode so I could show my thirteen year old son the kind of shows I used to watch as a kid.  We both busted a gut for all of six minutes or so while we marveled at the bad animation and cheesy sound effects, not to mention the almost non-existent plot (Deadalus Kidnaps Helena).  It's hard to find common ground with a young teenager sometimes, but I nailed it last night.  And I got him thinking about Greek mythology at least.

The take home lesson for me is that just because I loved something as a child doesn't make it great; it just makes it a great memory.  In this case, a great memory I could share with my son.",1453593600,2,935,4.161111111111111
