5053096,5,B0072VFXN4,"Its a shame Amazon doesn't even have a picture of this on its item page, I think this Rifftrax DVD in particular deserves a bit more attention than its getting.

Simply put, this is a fantastic entry into their catalogue and a welcome addition to the DVD collection of anyone who's been missing MST3k.

Speaking of MST3k, Galaxy Invader has actually appeared on the show before, though not as a full episode.  Observant fans will recognize Galaxy Invader as the ""other movie"" that played during the credits of ""Pod People.""

Galaxy Invader's plot is fairly simple:  An alien lands in a cartoon fireball and runs afoul of a disgusting drunken redneck and several of his ugly family members and friends.  They want to kill/capture the alien and use it to get rich, while a kid who saw the fireball and his professor want to save the alien from the rednecks.  Complications ensue, the alien probably dies, the redneck definitely dies, and the movie grinds to a halt without really doing anything to tell us why the alien came here in the first place.  I mean, sure, its called ""Galaxy Invader"" so you could infer the alien was supposed to be invading Earth, but he mostly attacks in retaliation to his redneck agressors, he doesn't really seem to personally be there to fight.

This movie is from the mid 80's, though the styles and character types reek of the 70's.  The characters themselves are quite a revolting bunch, most of them make the family from ""Giant Spider Invasion"" look like British royalty.  There's one point where the drunk rednecks equally drunk brother (or something, I can't remember how they know each other) takes the cigar out of his mouth and drools about a quarter cup of spit straight on the ground.  He doesn't spit, he actually DROOLS on camera, in such a casual, ""this is completely normal"" way that I'm not even sure it was on purpose.  You get the feeling a lot of these actors were just as disgusting in real life as they are in this movie.

Given the abundance of riffing material, it should come as no surprise that Mike and Co. have a field day with all the disgusting redneck characters and squalid settings.  If you enjoyed MST3k episodes like ""Giant Spider Invasion"" or ""Boggy Creek 2"" you'll dig this one, the guys are absolutely on fire here.

An easy 5 star entry to the Rifftrax catalogue.  Pick it up, you'll want to show this one to your friends.",1343088000,16,2389,4.623222748815166
5053097,5,B0072VFXN4,"While out in the woods a young student sees a fireball crash into a deeper part of the woods so he calls his former professor who answers the phone shirtless and he says he'll be there in six hours (I don't know why, maybe shirt wearing was something he never mastered and it takes him a while). The fireball was of course a spaceship and the alien inside comes out to explore and by explore I mean kill, then kill, then kill, then get captured by some drunken hicks (are there ever any other kind in these films?). The professor and the student try to get clues to the whereabouts of the alien (even asking a bartender in a full bar very non-discreetly I might add) and we can't forget Joe a drunken father with a hole in his shirt who loves to hunt his daughter with a shotgun and yell at his 40 year old simple minded son.

The movie is quite a mess as you can imagine, there isn't one likeable character in the film, the cheesy clothed style of filming is very annoying, as is the night shooting scenes and the endless padding just to reach 80 minutes of running time. Thankfully the Rifftrax crew does a spectacular job slamming the many horrid aspects of the movie, they keep the jokes coming fast and furious and I was laughing non-stop during a lot of the movie. Only one drawback is the hideously awful end credits, that has the most annoying voice riffing them (some high pitched, something or other).

That being said, this is a great addition to your Rifftrax DVD collection, the guys are really on their game here.",1338422400,17,1527,4.392226148409894
5053098,5,B0072VFXN4,"This movie so deserved a riffing. OMG! Campy, cheesy, very awful acting and the worst part of this film, is it was meant to be that bad. RiffTrax takes aim at The Galaxy Invader and fires away with some hilarious riffs to the jugular. I love RiffTraxs. Guys, keep on riffing!",1500681600,,275,4.411764705882353

5053102,5,B0072VFXN4,"Rifftrax is a dependable source of good times with bad movies, and Galaxy Invader is no exception.  The alien comes to Earth, no reason given, and despite his superior technology has no means of communicating with the locals.  I guess that would interfere with killing them by the boatload.  It looks like someone took a cheap Swamp Thing knockoff and stuck some random bits on, and basically wanders around clubbing and zapping people.  The people in the movie are so foul you want the monster to kill them all, and the faster the better.  The Rifftrrax crew tear the movie apart throughout this stinker, which is why we're all here anyway.  Galaxy Invader had me and my brothers laughing long and hard, and was surprisingly affordable purchase.",1463616000,,746,4.834645669291339
5053103,5,B0072VFXN4,"An absolute hootfest.  The former MST3K leads (Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, Bill Corbett) continue the fun tradition of heckling and riffing with this entry.  The Galaxy Invader is the most mal-odorous stinkburger I have ever seen, which makes it perfect for Rifftrax's attention.  The film is full of the most unpleasant, offensive redneck types with the most disgusting habits, such as spit-drooling and menacing one's own family with shotguns.  How the stomach turns.  It also has one of the worst galaxy invading alien costumes ever.  The only thing that makes this film palatable is the Rifftrax treatment.  Highly recommended.",1460592000,,630,5.303030303030303
5053104,5,B0072VFXN4,The story is this an alien lands in a backwater full of hicks and inbred rednecks every sterotype is protrayed here the protagonist is a father of two kids a real charmer who turns out to be a rapist and murderer as well as a abuser of his teenage daughter. Gross they getba posse to hunt the invader to get rich the find his weapons you end up rooting for the monster by the way for some reason pa spends the whole movie in a dirty tee shirt with a huge hole in it the riffs are hilarious I highly recommend.,1456012800,,509,4.0495049504950495
5053105,5,B0072VFXN4,Very funny! The idea of making fun of cheesy movies is sheer genius.,1437868800,,68,4.3076923076923075

5053108,4,B0072VFXN4,"As much as I enjoy the riffs, this movie is one of the bad ones that's so awful, it's hard to have to watch it even with the jokes. Also because the film is so one dimensional, many of the jokes revolve around the few topics in it. On the other hand, they work it to death, especially the lovably deranged old man who chases his daughter with a shotgun, evidentily a regular enough event that no one pays it much mind. It also helps when the alien the protagonists try to help is an eyeless murderer that kills nearly all he meets.

So while it's not the best, it's worth having, once you buy the better ones first. Might I recommend the laughably awful 'The Guy From Harlem' perhaps....",1415491200,,687,4.2846153846153845

5053114,3,B0072VFXN4,"The Rifftrax boys take on the story of some hillbillys and thier get-rich-quick scheme that involves a giant green alien monster. Made by the same man who made ""The Alien Factor""!",1399075200,,179,4.806451612903226
5053115,3,B0072VFXN4,"Have to disagree with the other reviewers here. This movie was good fodder for riffing, with horrible acting, stupid gun-crazy hicks and a morally ambivalent lizard alien whose presence in the inbred-est part of Maryland goes completely unexplained. ""Galaxy Invader"" indeed. More like Galaxy Trespasser. The dumb hicks deal with him easily enough. And there's only one of him. No invasion to speak of.

Mike, Kevin and Bill on a good day could have wrought comedy gold from this, as they did with the similar Giant Spider Invasion. Alas, it wasn't a good day, so much, when they riffed Galaxy Invasion. They get off a few good shots, but something in their tone is a little too aggressive. They seem more irritated than normal, and the barbs come off as bullying rather than teasing. Also, they try to make dumb things funny by repeating them over and over. Most unforgivable is the bad singing over the credits. (Hint for next time: if a name isn't particularly funny, or even if it is, you won't make it funnier by screeching it in an atonal voice for four minutes. They could have just handed the movie to a six year old, with equally unfunny and annoying results.)

Don't get me wrong, I still love the guys, and I will watch this one again at some point, to see if it grows on me, but this one is not their best. (For their best, I suggest their live production of Jack The Giant Killer).",1398038400,,1393,4.5458167330677295
5053116,5,B0072VFXN4,"Non-stop, intense commentary on a film I've already seen in its original form from another, generic collection. Nearly died laughing from hyperventilation and almost choking on my chocolate-covered pretzels. There is definitely little case for sympathy for the 'survivors' at the end of the film. Where are the cops in this town, anyway? And who waits six hours by the side of the road after a meteor crashes? What college professor who may be on the brink of the 'greatest discovery in the history of mankind' doesn't bring a boat-load of sampling equipment, or at the very least, a camera? (They brought a geiger counter during the Giant Spider Invasion...) And somebody, please, get that guy a new shirt!",1393459200,,707,4.949579831932773
5053117,4,B0072VFXN4,"I LOVE Don Dohler's work. The man was hero of sorts and an inspiration to kids like myself back in the late 70's/early80's who were aspiring to be little Steven Spielberg juniors using our parents' Super8mm home movie cameras. His work was semi-regularly featured in long-defunct Starlog magazine's sister publication, the awesome CineMagic. I recall this film being released on home video back in the late 80's/early 90's in 2 different versions. Same cover art and back of the box descriptions. Only difference was the tagline on the front of the box. Originally, it read ""He came to earth. His goal? To survive!""  When folks didn't seem to respond to the idea of a kindly alien who didn't snack on Reese's Pieces, the box's end tagline was changed so that his new goal was ""To KILL!!!"" LOL.

This film may be a chore to watch for those not accustomed to the desperate, hard times/no money offerings from Dohler who, (along with a handful of others), was miraculously able to turn what were essentially home movies into legit home video releases. If you can get into his work then you're in luck since the film can be viewed without the RiffTrax voiceovers, allowing you to watch it as it was intended. If this stuff isn't your cup of tea, then the MST3K-cum-RiffTrax crew will help make it a little more palatable with a heaping helping of their stinging riffs. I love seeing this both ways. Thank you RiffTrax!",1388966400,5,1414,4.720647773279352
5053118,4,B0072VFXN4,"Another good job by the Rifftrax crew, making a horrible movie watchable.  This is one of the few movies I've seen where the actors are more loathsome and despicable than the characters they are playing.  If you were one of the unfortunate people who watched this movie without benefit of the guys from Rifftrax, there's no doubt you would have wanted to take a shower when it ended.  Now you can watch it again and just laugh.",1385856000,,427,4.51948051948052
5053119,5,B0072VFXN4,"And this one is hillarious.  If you're a fan of MST3K or already a fan of the Riff guys, this one is a definite must have.  The movie itself is, of course, horribly awful but I was laughing from the intro credits.",1380067200,,213,4.0476190476190474
5053120,5,B0072VFXN4,"I'll keep this short:  It's a good movie to spoof, the jokes are great, and there is no extra garbage.. just the stuff you buy these DVD's for!",1377734400,,143,4.107142857142857
5053121,3,B0072VFXN4,"The reason I didn't love it is clear--the movie is awful. Not so bad it's good, just bad and dreary. I bought this DVD at the same time as Crater Lake Monster, and that's a much more fun bad movie. This one ground at me. It isn't that the riffing is bad--it's fine--but if you've never bought one of these Rifftrax DVDs, this is not the one I'd start with. (House on Haunted Hill or Plan 9 are good ones to start with, imo.)",1373068800,,424,4.059523809523809
5053122,5,B0072VFXN4,"MST3K and Rifftrax episodes can be hit and miss at times.  That's not saying that all of them aren't funny, but to varying degrees.  At times the movies are so bad I can see the Rifftrax crew throwing up their hands in despair and just try to get the movie over with.  Galaxy Invader, however, is one of those episodes that you will long remember.  The movie just isn't bad, it's hilariously bad and the comments just make it that much more delicious.  The movie is a mix of a hillbilly soap opera with a local, incompetent crime boss, thrown in with an alien arriving from outer space.  The mix of these three things is hilarious and it should not be missed.",1365724800,,659,4.360655737704918
5053123,4,B0072VFXN4,"The riffing in this one was not quite at the level required to elevate this movie from its status of ""sadly terrible"" to ""sublimely hilarious"", as achieved for another recent release, Crater Lake Monster. May not warrant repeat viewing. Still though, it is Rifftrax, which is better --- even at its worst --- than most fare on TV.",1365379200,,330,4.706896551724138
5053124,4,B0072VFXN4,"Mike, Bill and Kevin still got it.  The riffs may not be as diverse or widespread as they could have been back in the MST3k days, but the jokes land more often than not in this turkey of a movie.  One thing that caught my ear in particular were the accents Some of the characters sounded stereotypically Baltimorean and doggone it if the thing wasn't filmed in Maryland!

For the price, this definitely deserves a place in your treasure trove of terrible films.",1360800000,,461,4.530120481927711
5053125,4,B0072VFXN4,"This time the guys from Rifftrax take on Galaxy Invader, a bad sci-fi / horror movie from the 80's. The first half is consistently funny, with many jokes about the white trash rednecks who populate the town that the movie is set in. However, the riffers seem to run out of the steam later on in the film with less jokes. I can't blame them though, as the movie does get pretty boring later on and there really isn't much to joke about. Most of the cheesy stuff does happen earlier in the movie, after all. Still, this one is definitely worth seeing for fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Rifftrax.",1346803200,,603,4.392857142857143
5053126,5,B0072VFXN4,"I Highly Recommend This Rifftrax!! Galaxy Invaders; The riffs in this one are outstanding!! The actors drift in and out of charactor - one moment they're moronic hillbillies - the next they slip into just plain old regular folks. Great riffs about a drunken hillbilly father - who abuses his family - and carries a shotgun - and when his daughter screams outside in the middle of the night - he jumps out of bed - shotgun in hand and the gang riffs that 'No one besides me - abuses my daughter!!'. The movie drags a tad towards the end - and some loose peices in the film are never resolved. Just Great Humor!! And fun to watch again!! I Highly recommend this DVD.

Perhaps the badness of this film was too overwhelming for the RiffTrax crew because their comedic comments are overall mediocre and actually became annoying.
