7695978,5,B01D0X8WNU,"I ordered this season for the addition of Lucy Lawless--and she proves well worth it! Her performance is masterful; and while the series is a grim one, the cast holds the tone well. A fine production for its kind, lifted up by the strong work of Ms. Lawless. Recommended!",1495411200,,271,4.551020408163265
7695979,5,B01D0X8WNU,"A continuation of a original & authentic first season! Highly recommended if your someone who enjoys that historical period & ""horror"". On par with season 1;plot twists and a heightened anticipation for season 3....season cliffhangers!

7695984,2,B01D0X8WNU,"If you want to see how Marxism and Satanism are kissing cousins, then Salem is the show for you.  In all honesty though, I cannot recommend that anyone ever watch this program.  I would especially keep young impressionable minds (we know how much children are fascinated by tales of the occult) as far away from it as possible.  On the plus side, the show did inspire me to finally cancel my Netflix subscription.  I watch way too much television and the time would be better spent catching up on my reading and writing.
  I will try to be brief with this review. Here are the highlights:  gore, sadism, murder, decapitations, growls, screams, gurgles, choking, hangings, poisonings, vomiting, blood-letting, and incest.  Did I mention gore?  There is so much more of the same, but I will stop there.
  What possessed me to binge watch the first two seasons of this show you might wonder?  Well, it was simply the fact that I could not believe that someone had actually captured the essence of the progressive movement in a fictional, chilling horror series.  This is a case of art, or what goes for art these days, imitating life.
  The story is set in Salem, Massachusetts in the late 1600s around the time of the infamous witch trials.  The series is not a reenactment of those events, but rather a period drama.  There is much story to be told when you throw in a few historical figures, some delicious man-candy, and hordes of hot voluptuous witch flesh.  Add some highly trained British actors (love those classical accents), and a theme song by Marilyn Manson (he also plays a small cameo role as a perverse barber/surgeon), and you have a popular hit television series.
  To me the most significant recurring theme of this show is one of intense misandry.  Many of the women of Salem have been so oppressed and mistreated, first by the men of England, and now by the men in the new world, that they have no other choice than to turn to the dark arts in order to scrabble together some power for their own protection from these sadistic puritan males.  Many are the scenes of bitter vitriol, hate, and complaint against how the patriarchy has ruined womens lives and stolen their power.  So whatever heinous act these witches commit is always justifiedas in social justice.
  It is quite remarkable how this show reflects current attitudes and events.  There is great animosity against the upper class, and a movement to tear it all down.  As the body count increases and the main characters get deeper and deeper into a mess of mayhem and destruction, Satan arrives on the scene as a little boy born to one of the witches.  Now things get really interesting as the dark lord prepares his conspiracy to bring the end times to the earth.  He has a way of torturing everyone around him, including the loyal witches that brought him to this dimension.  They assumed he would award them with more power and prestige, but they are in for a nasty surprise.  It is much like the reality we live in where the left eat their own.  Whether the creators of this program know it or not, they have produced a beautifully hideous reveal about the heart of cultural Marxism and how its poisonous ideas can destroy a community, or a nation.
  There is one redeeming element to the story which is a surprising thread of remedy that exists for all the horror that is Salem.  Surprising, in that it seems so small, clichd, and sentimental, when compared to all the dramatic malevolence.  But in the end, what else except Love could conquer all this hate?",1491091200,,3542,4.647342995169082

7695990,5,B01D0X8WNU,"I LOVE THIS SERIES!  But ugh - I'm blazing through this series in one week and won't be able to watch it again until season 3 is out on DVD!  This show is like Harry Potter and Interview with a Vampire for adults.  Lots of very sexual scenes amid dark magic, drama, suspense and intrigue.  The clothing is AMAZING. A very clever twisting of  events of the Salem witch hunts.  Marilyn Manson's song at the beginning is perfect.  ""Pound me the witch drums...better pray for hell, not hallelujah!""",1483920000,2,494,4.545454545454546
7695991,5,B01D0X8WNU,"Love having this and Season 1 on DVD to watch whenever I want, but wish there were extras-behind the  scenes, costumes, and the creators, writers. Hope maybe Season 3 also comes out on DVD with some of these extras. Yes, there is plenty on Facebook, YouTube, etc. But it would be great to have all three seasons and maybe extras all in one set of DVDs",1483488000,,351,4.318181818181818

It does deviate from the true story, as it is a television show, but I think it is marvelously well done.

I remember seeing a promo for this show once or twice prior to the first season premiere but then, after hearing nothing else and, as with so many other great shows these days, thought it cancelled.  Came across two seasons of this at a friend's house the other night and thought I'd watch an episode or two to see what it was like and I couldn't stop watching it...  I knew I'd read about John Alden and Tituba somewhere in my younger years and how interested I once was in the Salem witch trials, so I am hooked!.  Wish there were more episodes per season...  Great acting and excellent effects and script.  Seriously don't understand why shows like this get next to no coverage, usually leading to early cancellations.",1464739200,2,899,4.47239263803681
