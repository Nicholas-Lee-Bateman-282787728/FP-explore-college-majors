It begins with scenes from the 1960s. Christopher Boyce leaves a note in a chapel and leaves. He practices the ancient art of falconry. In Mexico Andrew Daulton Lee leaves money for a woman then buys a packet from a man. Cars are lined up to cross into the US. License plates provide information on the owners, some undergo rigorous inspection by a dog. A sleeping Lee is surprised and draws a pistol! Boyce left the seminary. The news tells of Nixons impeachment vote. Boyces father tells him of a job opening. The Black Bird is a name for satellites that circle the globe and spy on activities. Boyces job will work on secret intelligence for the RDX company. They show teletype machines in a secure room. Lee offers Boyce a more lucrative job. Drinking on the job? Boyce reads secret messages.

The CIA will intervene in Australian labor conflicts. The talk tells about their characters. Boyce leaves home for his own apartment. He tells Lee about the lies and deceptions of the CIA to US allies. They talk about Chile, where an elected government was overthrown. [No mention of the economics involved.] Boyce makes an offer to Lee. Lee sells drugs. The police raid their place! Lee is offered a deal, be an informer or go to San Quentin. Boyce passes documents to Lee to sell for the best price at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Note how information is exchanged by newspapers in a public place. Lee signs a receipt for $6,000. [Can he read what it says?] Boyce buys pigeons and meets a young woman. She sees Lee meet Boyce. [Those monetary figures are out of date.] Lee has new identification papers. Boyces parents pay him a surprise visit while Lee is there. The Governor-General of Australia ousted the Premier (using an obscure law). A tape on a pole sends a message.

Lee makes copies of documents on a public copier. They are put in a bank deposit vault for a later pickup. Later he meets an agent at a public park at night. He exchanges newspapers, and is told of a new meeting place. He is given a Minox camera, copying documents is a danger (because there is a counter for each copied document). Were Lee and Boyce altar boys! Lee shows his photographic slides. Lee tells what he is doing to Boyces girlfriend! His father meets him and gives him a lecture. Lee snorts a brown powder in his bathroom. Boyce codes a message about his courier. Documents are copied with the Minox. Boyce climbs over the Soviet Embassy walls and joins the party. Then he is led into a basement. Did Lee make a mistake? Back in the states the Boyce family celebrates Christmas.

At work Boyce learns an NSA Inspector is arriving, they hurry to tidy up. The Pyramid Project book is worthless; was it bait? Lee talks of a house in Costa Rica, his family objects to his business. Lee has a new escape (a car chase for action). Boyce wants to quit, but Lee objects. Boyce is upset at home. He visits Lee in Mexico. Alex meets Boyce and Lee; he wants the frequencies and information about Boyces co-workers. But Boyce is quitting RDX to return to college. Lee has an emotional problem. Back at work Boyce photographs a binder. There is a surprise party for Chris at his apartment. Lee gets a surprise too! Boyce wants to make one last delivery on the Pyramid Project. Men watch Lee. The Mexican police arrest and search him. Boyce buys a flight to Buenos Aires. Lee is beaten to get a confession, then he is deported to America. Boyce warns his girlfriend. Then he too is arrested and confesses all. His conscience made him do it. Boyces younger brothers are beaten at school. The pair are tried and convicted.

This is based on a true story. It is lengthy but worth watching once as a true crime story. The moral is to be careful of your friends. Was something missing in the background of these two?",1477699200,,3829,4.535455861070912

8457311,4,B005535F34,"I'm an Aussie & have a vivid memory of the Whitlam dismissal so it had some particular appeal to me, that said it's also amazingly relevant given the Edward Snowden debacle and the somewhat less so wiki leaks business. As a movie it's ok with, in my view, a stand out performance by a young Sean Penn.  It's quite low key without any real highs or lows. There is no real focus on character development other than the leads and the story, though interesting, plods along at a presentable pace. The thing I took from it is that a lot of these traitors & thieves drape patriotism around their shoulders like a fur-lined flag but are really only idealists who think that only their point of view is what matters.  I suspect that in such cases it's just a matter of dumb luck when such a foolish individual just happens to land a job right where he is most susceptible to his personal foibles and where he can create the most damage. These types of so-called heroes are like cancers that you never expect to happen to you.  Even so this movie does want you to judge them with sympathy to a minor extent but generally leaves it open for consideration.",1408752000,,1145,4.4170616113744074
8457312,4,B005535F34,"This film is another one that really had the potential to be something really great, but just fell short.  It is about a true story and is acted pretty well with a good cast.  It just did not hold my interest and could have been written a little better.  This is only my opinion and if you watch it you may not agree.  I think it is worth the purchase and is becoming a cult classic.",1402099200,3,383,4.0
