7902929,5,B000003K9I,"In ""The Cloud,"" Episode 6 of ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) decides to investigate a nebula that has a high level of omicron particles, which could supplement the ship's energy reserves.  However, something in the nebula starts draining the ship's energy.  Apparently turn about is fair play, even in the Delta Quadrant.  ""Voyager"" manages to escape and Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) decides that he and Harry Kim (Garret Wang) should visit a holodeck recreation of a French bar from his days at the Academy.  I understand that recreation is important, especially when you are 70 light years from home, but given that they are short of energy and just had a nebula draining off power wasting what they had on the holodeck seems rather reckless.  Fortunately this is just a subplot, because what makes this one of the better first season episodes is the main plotline.
You see, Torres (Roxann Biggs-Dawson) has been anlayzing one of globules that the nebula attached to ""Voyager"" and discovers something very interesting about them that causes the Captain to rethink what just happened to them.  As was the case with the previous episode, ""Phage,"" this episode plays off Janeway's tendency to put the welfare of others above those of her own crew.  This, of course, was a contributing factor in the decision Janeway made in the pilot that got her vessel stuck in the Delta Quadrant.  Beyond that, ""The Cloud"" is an above-average problem-solving ""Star Trek"" episode, where the scientific ideas they are throwing around actually make sense and help develop the resolution.  We also see the Doctor (Robert Picardo) show some abilities outside the realm of medicine.  Then there is the episode's punch line when Janeway finds her senior  bridge crew hanging out in a French bar on the holodeck.  This is not a classic ""Voyager"" episode, but a very solid one that speaks well for the start the series got off to in Season 1.  The first half-dozen episodes of ""Voyager"" are better than the same number from any other ""Star Trek"" series.",1054425600,,2055,4.938953488372093
7902930,5,B000003K9I,"I enjoyed this episode very much. The characters are colorful and lively... the interaction between different characters is wonderful. It has a lot of humor in it.  I actually liked the plot about the ""cloud"".  This episode has something for everyone. It is easily one of Voyagers best episodes.",1033171200,,295,5.0
7902931,4,B000003K9I,"This episode of Voyager did a pretty good job of developing the entire ensemble cast that come to be the focus of the show, and for that reason, I highly recommend it.
A couple of memorable Voyager quotes (""There's coffee in that nebula!"") come from this episode, and there is some important character development going on with regard to Janeway and Chakotay especially.
Of particular interest is the developing relaxed relationship between the Captain and the First Officer.  It is a significant development that Janeway has become comfortable enough with Chakotay to ask him to help her meet her animal guide.  And in return, that Chakotay appears eager to expose his mystical side to the Captain.
The scenes in the holosuite bar (Sandrines)are fun and set the stage for many scenes to come in the Voyager series.  And it's good to see Janeway ""let her hair down"" and be one of the gang!",995328000,,889,4.7973856209150325
7902932,5,B000003K9I,"Just one of the many great lines in this very good episode.  Best one was  during the scene where the crew is playing pool.
Gary (to Torres):  ""Now me, I have a whole different approach to women: Treat a lady like  a tramp and a tramp like a lady. Never fails""
Torres:  ""Paris,  did you program this guy.""
Paris:  ""Yeah, why?""
Torres:  ""He's a pig.  And so are you.""
I enjoy the growing interaction  among the crew evident in this episode.  ""Voyager"" did more of  this in just a handful of episodes in its first season than the other  ""Treks"" did in several years.
However, the central plot --  exploring a nebula which really turns out to be a lifeform -- is pretty  much standard ""Trek"" stuff. A little contrived, as usual, but  still good fun.",962668800,10,746,4.375
7902933,5,B000003K9I,"This is an awesome episode, some great one liners by Janeway, and the first we really see of a Janeway/Chakotay relationship, with Janeway finding her spirit guide.  Also a very entertaining scene in Sandrine's bar  with playing pool.  ""Commander your stick please.""  LOL!  This is  a must for all J/Cers and any Voyager fan for that matter!  I loved it!",957744000,,354,4.8
7902934,5,B000003K9I,"Episodes like ""The Cloud"" are why I love Voyager. Throughout the entire show, we're treated to romance, adventure, comedy, action, drama, and character development. We also get to hear some sparkling dialogue. I  especially enjoyed Janeway's, ""There's coffee in that nebula!""  Kate Mulgrew is a great actress, and Janeway is my favorite Trek Captain.  Some of my favorite scenes include the scene where Neelix gives Janeway his  ""even better than coffee"" substitute, the scene where Janeway  searches for her animal guide, and the scene where the crew plays pool.  Since I hadn't seen any Season 1 Voyager episodes since they originally  aired back in 1995, I was thrilled to see that they're finally on video.  Well, I think Voyager is Star Trek's best series, and I loved ""The  Cloud"". It was very entertaining. If you like Voyager too, then you'll  probably enjoy it.",955065600,4,870,5.020979020979021
