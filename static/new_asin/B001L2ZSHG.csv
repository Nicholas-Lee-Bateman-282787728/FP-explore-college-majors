3677603,5,B001L2ZSHG,"This DVD truly showcases the quality of the Blue Ray disk.  The picture is dazzling -- extremely crisp and colorful.  And, the show itself is very well put together.

3677604,4,B001L2ZSHG,"I am a huge fan of the ufc and mixed martial arts in general. This dvd has some of the best fights from 2008 in the ufc. Overall they were all good with the standouts being the brock lesner fights and any of the light heavyweight fights. The only problem that I had was that they didn't have all the best fights which included some of the anderson silva and lyoto machida fights. Instead they just had 3 miuntes montages of a few different fighters of what they did in 2008. I wish they actually showed the whole fights that are presented in these packages, but they just don't. Other than this one complaint the set was exellent and any fan of the ufc from the casual to the hardcore should get it.",1243814400,,699,4.2631578947368425
3677605,5,B001L2ZSHG,"UFC has a poor track record with their best of dvd's.  Luckily this one doesn't dissapoint.  The bonus material (which is left out of some ufc dvds altogether) is great.  There's a top 5 ko's of the year, top 5 subs of the year, and then some behind the scenes looks from before and after the big events of 2008.

The main feature shows complete fights of some of the biggest match-ups in 2008 but also gives you a brief retrospective of how the year went for less popular fighters like Florian, Nate Diaz, Bisping, Machida, etc.

Plus, at $13.50 for two quality blu ray discs the value simply can't be beat.  If you own a blu ray player and can only buy one ufc dvd this would clearly be the one.",1240012800,2,697,4.242424242424242

Whenever you put together a set, and include the word ""best"" in the title, there's always going to be room for debate regarding the included content. Ultimately, this is a decent selection of fights from 2008. Even though I had already seen all of the featured fights, it somehow all seemed fresh again. Well, at least for awhile. The main feature does an adequate job of focusing on certain obvious fighters, and it generally flows pretty well. One surprise was the inclusion of the Mir/Nogueira fight on Disc 1, which wasn't listed on the insert. Extra fights are always good! The Top 5 Knockouts and Top 5 Submissions were nice extras as well. My only slight complaint, well, make that a suggestion, is the UFC: Behind The Scenes extra. Don't get me wrong, I like the footage. I think that it could have been removed as an extra though, and instead, worked into the main feature. In the opening of the DVD, some of the highlighted fights are briefly discussed. As you go through the DVD, many of those fights are shown in their entirety and analyzed. After you get through it all, the Behind The Scenes extra literally goes through chosen fights AGAIN, with further analysis from different angles and relevant personalities. It seemed to me that all of the exclusive footage could have been worked in around each of the full-length fights, and once it was over, move on to the next topic. By the time it was all over, I felt like I had been in a fight myself, being beaten over the head with the same material. In the end, I really did enjoy the set though. It wasn't the knockout that it could've been (per the above listed), but ultimately a hard-fought decision victory.",1239408000,10,3245,4.870673952641166
3677607,4,B001L2ZSHG,"Amazing picture in Blu Ray. All fights featured were shot in HD. Box says 1080I. I believe Blu Ray player upscales to 1080P. Definetely a notch above the PPV HD broadcasts.

As others stated, there should have been more complete fights included on each disk since since Blu Ray discs support 50 Gigs of data.  I would have liked to have seen Hendo/Anderson, Machida/Tito, and Lesnar/Herring complete fights. Also, a few of the e Fight for the Troops main card.

 UFC should include some easter eggs in their DVDs. If your a UFC/MMA fan this is required buying at the current cheap price for a Blu Ray.",1238716800,,601,4.588785046728972
3677608,5,B001L2ZSHG,"To the previous reviewer who wanted to know what the ""packages"" are, they are basically clips/promos. For example, the Evan Tanner package is probably like 3 minutes of an Evan Tanner tribute. The fight for the troops package is just a 3 minute promo/summary of that event.

I just watched this today. I always order UFC PPV events in HD and this blu-ray is certainly better quality. This is a must for any UFC/MMA fan.",1238544000,,419,4.586666666666667
3677609,4,B001L2ZSHG,"Recieved UFC: Best Of 2008 from Amazon. Kind of strange how they decided to include 2 25GB discs instead of putting everything on a 1 50GB disc.
