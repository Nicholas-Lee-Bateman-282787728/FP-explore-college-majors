3119647,2,B0013XS87U,"This is an important topic which deserved a far more comprehensive treatment. If you knew nothing about this subject except what you saw in the DVD then you would conclude that Muslims were all wonderful, Christians were all bad, and that Jews hardly existed in Medieval Spain. For example, Hughes uses the word Crusade, but not Jihad. She also skirts the reasons just how Islam expanded from Arabia to France and Persia in less than a century. It was not just due to the attractiveness of its ideas. On the positive side, she explores the contributions Muslims made in preserving and expanding upon the works of Greece and Rome and how they were transmitted to the West. I only wish she spent more time discussing Averroes, Avicenna, and other great scholars. She might also have spent some time discussing how and why Islam turned its back on science and philosophy in the 12th and 13th centuries. We in the West need to understand more about the rise, grandeur, and decline of Islam followed by the rise of the so called gunpowder empires in Turkey, Iran, and India without fear of being politically incorrect.",1212537600,75,1113,4.772020725388601

3119665,5,B0013XS87U,"This documentary is a summary about a most important time in Europe that typically requires an involved research. I was happy to see this summary, and recommend it. It covers this important period in Medieval Europe. Take note, I am not a historian.

Bethany Hughes presents a visual documentary about Europes Iberian Peninsula, aka todays Spain and the conquered country of Al Andalus that lasted from 710 AD to 1492. Europes Medieval Period, aka The Dark Ages, lasted from the 5th to 15th century and ended with the Crusades. Andaluss conquerors discovered numerous libraries throughout the country. The books of these abundant libraries were copied from the Great Library of Egypt. Europes development accelerated because of the newfound Andalusian knowledge, and fostered Western thinking during the European Renaissance 15th to 17th century. From there, modern Europe of today formed with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia.

Bethany Hughes has other informative history documentaries. Her explanation of the pyramids of Egypt offer compelling ideas. Terry Jones, also an academic historian and a member of Britains famed Monty Python group, has many informative and entertaining documentaries about Medieval Europe. Europes history is about power and corruption, and a social order composed of the ruling elite class and a servant class. Americas founding fathers offered a change to Europes paradigm with the Declaration of Independence.  RJ-Nov 2016",1477958400,,1451,5.497757847533633

3119687,5,B0013XS87U,"A few people may be watching this presentation who may have actually not known about the history of the Moors in Spain. Most people have had the standard classes in this history. Others may have enthusiastically covered this area for their occupation or possibly just checking on ancestors.

For some people this presentation tells them what they already know however by explaining it in a different way it verifies and enhances their knowledge.

The advantage in having a one person presentation such as this is that you get that one perspective instead of a hodgepodge of soundbites by various people each with their own agenda conflict being and forcing you to choose sides instead of getting a precise picture.

The disadvantage any one person presentation is that a few people will feel that packs were left out or this is being politically correct or for some other reason has problems focusing on the fact that this presentation has a particular viewpoint that needs to be taken in consideration.

I have always liked Bettanys video presentations. However she really excels in writing and I suggest that you read Her first book Helen of Troy: Goddess, Princess, Whore to get a better feel of the presenter.

One of Bettanys strong points is her enthusiasm and energy as she points out the different locations where the history took place.

Meantime I also learned quite a few new facts to digest.

There are some excellent pictures of places in this presentation. However the background sound may sometimes drowned out what is being said.

You will definitely want to add this to your video library.",1468108800,,1606,4.9222222222222225

3119690,1,B0013XS87U,"I wanted to learn more about this topic from BOTH sides of the story.  Too bad that political correctness was more important than facts and logic in this documentary, what a waste of money and time.

First off, if you're going to be PC, be PC to everyone.  In this documentary they gave the Muslims credit for inventing the concept of a zero in mathematics and for our current number system, and brought it up multiple times.  They were trying to be so PC to the Muslims that it was a slap in the face to the people of India who were the ones that actually created these mathematical concepts and symbols (yet went entirely unmentioned), Muslims simply spread the concepts through their trade routes and massive empire.  When it came to the many mathematical contributions that Muslims actually did invent, they just glossed over that with literally a sentence or two, quite a shame.  If they can't get that right then how can I trust they did good research on anything else?

I also didn't like that they tried to paint the invasion and occupation of Spain as some sort of righteous thing, and it was deemed a ""betrayal"" when the Spaniards later re-claimed their own country.  Would the writers of this documentary think it was a betrayal when people took back their native lands from the Romans, or the Huns, or if Native Americans had taken their lands back from the invading Europeans (despite how many pretty buildings that got built, which is just paramount to these filmmakers), would that have been a ""betrayal""?  The cornerstone of the filmmakers' thinking seems to be an intersection of race/ethnicity of both the conquerors and the subjugated natives, mixed together with the current racist nature of modern Political Correctness.  Race and ethnicity shouldn't cloud one's judgment regarding the morality of taking back conquered land, or conquering other peoples' lands in the first place.

The filmmakers were awestruck with the pretty majestic buildings the Muslims built, and use them as a sign that all was well and healthy for the society and was a good thing for the Spaniards who survived the invasion.  Fantastic buildings cost what?  Money!  Where did this money come from?  In large part from the Spaniards they were ruling.  So instead of using those public funds to help the public, the funds were largely going to amazing buildings for the rulers.  How was that good for the Spaniards... seriously, how?  Throughout history, ridiculously lavish buildings or structures built in areas that aren't fantastically prosperous usually speaks to the hardship of the average citizens there, and often future failure of the society due to spending money on the wrong things (which, interestingly, is what happened to the Muslim rulers in Spain, I bet they wish they spent more on security,....hmmm...).

What also isn't even glossed over is that those horrifically lavish buildings probably were also funded by taxes they imposed in other areas of the Muslim empire as well, and quite impoverished areas at that.  They said the Muslims in Northern Africa were outraged at the decadence of the Muslims in Spain, since life for them under Muslim rule there was harsh and resources so limited.  Well yeah, if I was living in desperate poverty and yet paying taxes to build fancy palaces in far away lands, that would make me angry too.  But that second wave of invading Muslims are regarded as bad guys in this documentary.  The Muslim empire was rich for the same reason the Roman empire was rich, they took over other lands and peoples, stripped local resources in newly conquered lands, imposed steep taxes, and largely used that money on themselves (save building some fancy stuff in a few select places).  They kept running out of money so they had to keep conquering.  To me when I see those lavish buildings, I think of all the poor people throughout the Muslim empire that were exploited financially to make them.  This goes right over the heads of the filmmakers.

But hey, this whole nightmare was the most peaceful and wanted invasion of all time according to this film, despite all the people that died for it.  The filmmakers said that people gleefully turned over their property to the Muslim invaders, and that they converted to Islam in droves.  All the while the filmmakers assume it was willingly?  And how was the sale of homes gleeful, was the language of the contracts (most likely written by the Muslims conquerors), written in a gleeful way?  If they had to leave their homes back in those harsh times of mostly living off the land then hopefully there was tons of great fertile land to go to just sitting around in Spain?  And if there was a ton of great land to go to, then why did the invading Muslims need to take over people's homes in the first place, wouldn't they just go to those awesome unoccupied lands supposedly just sitting around in Spain?

And if it was the case that the people of Spain were so oppressed by their previous rulers that they were happy the Muslims were conquered, then why didn't these filmmakers explain that?  They hinted at that, but no facts presented.  What was life like in Spain for the average person before the Muslims showed up (in terms of law/order, fairness, human rights, economics, ability to progress in social/economic status, etc), and compare that to what life was like in Spain during Muslim rule, and after the Muslims were expelled.  If you want to convince me this invasion was good, then give me that comparison.  But they didn't, which means they probably don't have a good argument there, they just have pretty buildings to go on.

Lastly, it's odd that the filmmakers criticize Spanish history because it is history written by the victors, however the filmmakers' alternative version of history most likely comes from history written by the victorious Muslims during the time of the Muslim occupation (and other future writings from Muslim writers regarding the past victory), which itself was history written by the victors.  So how come history written by the victors is bad and untrustworthy when written by Spanish victors, but virtuous and true when written by the Muslim victors (despite their version of history not making logical sense)?  Again, this is the filmmakers avoiding logic and instead using political correctness to guide thought.

This documentary is so one-sided, very often illogically blinded by politically correct virtues, and so factually inept that it is a shining example of being a bad documentary.  They lose credibility within the first 10 minutes or so.  And frankly they missed an opportunity to do actual service to the Muslims that ruled Spain, which was the whole point of this documentary.  They didn't explain how life was better under Muslim rule, and the filmmakers had such little credibility by the end of the film that everything they say, even positive things about the previous Muslim rulers of Spain, has to be taken with a huge grain of salt.",1467590400,3,6984,4.872250423011844

3119728,3,B0013XS87U,"This apologetic ignores key Islamic teachings; the very teachings that fueled Islam's conquering Christians and imposing Mohammed's demand to convert, be a slave, or die. If one considers the Koran and Sunna, which teachings are as followed today among devout Muslims as in the 7th century, the video's rosy portrayal of life under Islam becomes quite suspect. The narrator's fawning view of Islamic occupation fuels her horror at backward Christians fighting to reclaim their country and culture.

At one point she acknowledges that the Muslim principle of ummah led to Muslim reinforcements coming from Africa to help quell the Christians. Ummah means that a Muslim is part of the worldwide community of Muslims. A devout Muslim's loyalty is to the ummah not to the country of residence. This in part explains why Muslims from 130 countries are fighting for Islamic State and return to their home countries to commit terror.  However, she ignores ummah as a motive for Granada's Muslims to collaborate with Turkish Muslims patrolling off the Spanish coast. Spanish understanding of unity of all Muslims against non-Muslims would be reason enough for Spain to expel Granada's and Spain's remaining Muslims.

Apologetic notwithstanding, I greatly enjoyed the video. Moorish architecture and art and Muslim contributions to the preservation of ancient knowledge and its development of new ideas are appreciated. The narrator Bettany Hughes is a physically beautiful and educated woman who can make any video interesting. She did similarly with Athens: the Truth about Democracy and many other productions. While I doubt her historical accuracy I enjoy her screen presence.

Once you get past the ""Muslims are urbane and Christians are barbarians"" bias, it is a worthwhile and educational watch.",1459209600,,1793,5.370106761565836

3119734,1,B0013XS87U,"Extremely biased information. Notice that ""true"" barbaric Islam invaded Spain in the second wave. The Visigoths were supposed to have crumbed - but then notice how the Muslims had diminished before Europe reclaimed the peninsula (no mention is made of this fact). Also, the narrator would not have been tossing her hair inside the mosque unless it had not been redeemed as a Christian church (probably would have lost her nose or ears). No mention that the Christians of Spain were forced to convert to Islam, just stated that somehow they were ""convinced"" to convert. The mosque on the cover uses the alternating red and white arches that originated in Christian Byzantium over 500 years before the Muslims copied the Byzantium style. The architecture of the Hagia Sophia Christian Church built in 537 was far superior to the Islamic buildings.  The Hagia Sophia  was designed so that a dome reaching 182 ft rested on 40 arched windows to provide 10,000 sq ft of open area (Image attached) without all the interior columns and arches that clutter the mosque on the cover of this documentary.",1458172800,8,1092,4.929347826086956

All of these are magnificent.  The Moorish architecture shown is stunning.  The narrative is pretty good, although, as noted by other reviewers, it is a little slanted toward the view that the Moors were tolerant, enlightened rulers and the Christians were backward and brutal.  This is mostly true.  The Moors were pretty benevolent, and the Christians, after the Reconquista and during the Inquisition, were brutal.

3119786,5,B0013XS87U,"This past summer a small group in our church read and discussed the book ""The Ornament of the World, How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain,"" written by the late Yale Sterling Professor of Languages Rosa Menocal. Her focus was on the cultural effects of the tolerant caliphs who ruled most of  Spain from 780  to 1492.  It was a long period of intellectual freedom, collaboration among scholars from Christendom, Jews, and Muslims.

This excellent documentary drew from that work and expands on it with stunning visual images of the Moors' structures and art.  It tells a story that is overlooked.  In fact, a Spanish friend told me that Spain still, as one of the Spanish scholars in the documentary says, tries to ignore the Moorish influences and the period of intellectual rigor.",1456185600,,826,4.906474820143885

The film shows how writings of ancient Greece were translated into Arabic in Alexandria and then copied to be studied in Toledo.  Scholars from all over Europe went to Toledo in 1200's and 1300's, providing the intellectual stimulation that culminated in the early Renaissance.

The Moors ruled the Iberian Peninsula, not Europe.  The Moors failed attempt to conquer France is touched upon by a reference to the Song of Roland. The Moorish occupation was benevolent compared to the malevolence that Ferdinand and Isabella instituted with the Inquisition.  Some of the Spanish heroes of the Reconquista were not so heroic, but mercenaries working back and forth for Spanish nobles and the Moorish conquerors.  That's shown in a talk with an old woman who's the direct descendant of Alonso Perez de Guzmn (1255 - 1309).  She lives in a castle in Cordoba with a huge library filled with original historical documents.  She shows on camera the original contract of Guzman with a Moorish noble, with the original red wax seal from 1295.",1456099200,,1136,5.00531914893617

3119790,1,B0013XS87U,"This ""documentary"" is more a commentary on the self-loathing of present-day Europeans than the state of Europe prior to the year 1492.  Ms. Hughes explains to us the most politically correct fashion that the Moors were essentially ""invited"" with ""open arms"" to invade Spain and progress onwards to France.  She bills the resistance and eventual expulsion of the Moors as the barbaric campaign, not the initial invasion itself.  She refers to the Spanish retaking their territory as ""ethnic cleansing"".  Not the inquisition, just the mere retaking gets that description.  And she acts as if many of the projects undertaken by the Muslim Moors had not been also constructed centuries before by the Romans.  Anyone with a decent and honest high school course in Western Civilization could debunk this film's assertions in real time.

And within the Muslim faith, even way back then, there were tensions between the highly-sophisticated Muslims who brought us Arabic numbers, astronomy, Islamic poetry, and some of the best art on the planet, and those ruffians who still, today, want to storm it all down in a misguided attempt to purify their faith.  After watching this film, you will be astounded by the sophistication of the Muslim culture that inhabited southern Spain at the time of the Inquisition, and your heart will break when you realize that the ""thugs"" who tore it down came from both sides: both the Christian ""Inquisition"" thugs -- and the Muslim ""purity"" thugs -- were equally coarse, and both sides burned thousands of books about astronomy and art that are now lost to history.

3119914,2,B0013XS87U,"The purpose of this documentary appears to have been to rehabilitate the reputation of Islamic rule in Spain from the eighth through the fifteenth centuries. Although the film does contain some interesting facts and lovely images, I found it to be an extraordinarily simplistic treatment of the period and its subject. Some of the themes I perceived in this work include the following: on the whole, Muslims were broadly tolerant of all other faiths, while Christians were narrow-minded bigots; the Islamic invasion of the Iberian peninsula was entirely benign and, in some cases, the Muslims took the role of savior of the people oppressed by the Visigoths; and the flow of knowledge and culture from Islamic Spain to Christian Europe was essentially a one-way current rather than a mutually beneficial interchange.

There are elements of truth in some of the picture Bettany Hughes paints in this documentary, and it is certainly important today to remember the high points of Islamic civilization in medieval Spain. However, the viewpoint advocacy employed in this documentary leaves the viewer with skewed understanding of what we actually know about the Moors in Spain and how they interacted with their neighbors. I will only take a couple of examples to show what I mean.

First, this documentary leaves one with the impression that Islam in the Spanish medieval world was largely monolithic and tolerant, with the primary sources of tension coming from outside--from the usual Christian suspects. However, in reality, the beginning of the end of al-Andalus did not derive from Christians but from divisions within Islam. It is certainly true that many of the early rulers of al-Andalus were relatively enlightened, cultured men interested in knowledge and learning. However, it was this very tolerance, and the relaxed approach taken to Islamic law regarding matters such as consumption of alcohol, that shocked and outraged the more fundamentalist Muslims of Northern Africa who waged civil wars against the more tolerant Muslims.

A second example relates to Bettany Hughes's own outrage that Christian conquerors had converted the Great Mosque of Crdoba into a Christian cathedral--one several events which she characterizes as ethnic cleansing. However, she fails to mention that the Great Mosque itself was built on the foundation of a Catholic basilica built by the Visigoths before it was razed by the Moors.

A final example is Bettany Hughes's contention that Christians had been suspicious and very cautious of acquiring knowledge from non-Christian sources, whereas Muslims had heartily embraced learning from pagan sources. There undoubtedly were instances in which these characterizations were true. However, it is somewhat ironic that in this context Ms. Hughes mentions the capture by Islamic armies of the library at Alexandria in Egypt in the seventh century. She fails to mention that the library was reported to have been burned by Muslims in AD 642. The historicity of this event is disputed. Nevertheless, the the fact that Ms. Hughes holds forth the taking of the library as evidence of Muslim broad-mindedness, without mentioning that it may well have been the opposite, suggests that she is less interested in getting at the historical facts than in furthering her narrative. Certainly subsequent events in the Muslim world caution against sweeping generalizations that characterize tolerance as a general Islamic virtue, rather than a characteristic of some members of a unique band of its adherents in medieval Spain.

I believe that a much, much better and more balanced documentary of Islamic medieval Spain is Cities of Light: The Rise and Fall of Islamic Spain, which was produced by Unity Productions Foundation. Cities of Light is highly respectful of the remarkable achievements in al-Andalus but does not resort to the sort of black-and-white generalizations as When the Moors Ruled in Europe. Cities of Light makes the point that tolerance was not a virtue possessed by only one of the protagonists in the Iberian encounter among Muslims, Jews, and Christians, and that no party had a monopoly on violence or bigotry. It also emphasizes that studying the ""practical tolerance"" practiced at the best of times in al-Andalus may hold answers for how members of the three Abrahamic faiths can coexist peacefully today.

If you can only see one documentary on this subject, see Cities of Light, and give this one a miss.",1450656000,44,4458,5.254213483146067
3119915,4,B0013XS87U,"I would say that most of the documentary is well intended, but there is always that slight demeaning applied to most of Spain's history. The reconquest of Spain, even if it is considered an ethnic cleansing, wasn't different to those of the rest of Europe, which happened way before Spain  had done it, including the one for which Spain is most vilified, the expulsion of the Jewish people from Spain, which happened long after most countries in Europe have done it already, and was Spain where most of them arrived after it.
The reconquest was exactly that, the recuperation of their land, a fact that only can be seen through the eyes of the original people, but it is considered a theme for debate this days because Iberia was occupied for so long by the moor culture. To regain such a vast amount of land it took centuries for the Christian kingdoms to get stronger enough to win their war and to take advantage of the dissolution of the Caliphate. The means to reconquest by the Christians were the same applied by any other kingdom anywhere in the known world of that era, which was an era of violence and conquest.
In regards of the cultural legacy of the Islamic world left in Spain, it was in-mensurable, and definitively, without it Europe would had never develop the way it did, unfortunately also, it could not had happened without the reconquest of Iberia where that wealth of lost and new knowledge was open to the whole world.
The lost of the Iberian peninsula by the Islamic world and regaining of it by the christian world was just another story of conquest and reconquest which fills our history books, whereas they are just or unjust stories. It does not have a Black or White areas, it is just the history of man kind and like it or not, it is the history of Spain not the other way around.",1449964800,,1810,4.535168195718654

3119917,1,B0013XS87U,"Impure garbage of whites without spines sucking up to Muslims by rewriting history. The argument goes like this the Moors had great palaces and  buildings made with meaning therefore every bad thing you have heard and people wrote down who were witnesses is false. What do palaces and architecture tell you about the people? This kind of flawed study and methodology is based on post modern thinking of self doubting self hating leftist who side with enemies of their own people always under the masquerade of pseudo scholarly skepticism. Skepticism and actual hostile bias against the actual chronicles and witnesses of the past and replacing it with vacuous love of archeology. They justify this to themselves beforehand as a matter of principle by assuming bias in written accounts, which is itself a dangerous bias. This has led to the discounting of the important records and words from history that tell us how brutal the Muslims were as we see evidenced today. So this poor quality and dated piece of enemy within style bunk that sides with enemies totally skips over the fact that the Moors were foreigner who invaded and took over other peoples lands and made them subject to them and have to submit to humiliating penalties and rules like paying a jizya, and sharia in order to live.

3119979,2,B0013XS87U,"I despise this style of pop history documentary.

1. They must insinuate that some deep mystery is about to be revealed based on recent evidence. Nonsense in this case. This history is well known, and much of what was burned when the nutters took over had made its way out when Toledo changed hands in the 12th century.

2. Works so hard to engage you that you can see it sweat. Between jump cuts the presenter is trying to seduce the camera and, sorry, she's just not my type. A couple of times I found myself trying to back up as she moved toward the camera and, once, I even flinched. Or maybe the camera was zooming in....I was so busy ducking and flinching I may have failed to notice.

3. Simplifies to the point of laughable inaccuracy. The term, Moors, is such an example, as others have noted. Many people migrated to Spain in this period because Rome had been totaled multiple times by this point and the rest of Europe was living in their own filth.

4. Uh....Jews? They were not a footnote in Spain, they spoke their own language - Ladino: a mixture of Hebrew and Medieval Spanish which is still spoken in some communities in Israel - and many of their descendants' families still have the keys to their houses.

This subject deserves better. The western notion of this period is awash with lunacy as is, frankly, the eastern one. Two data points. First, the 1961 Anthony Mann film, El Cid, starring Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren. Only good thing you can say about it is that, oh my god, did Sophia Loren look good. Had it been her presenting this documentary I would leaned toward the screen....sorry...got a little distracted there.

And, second, Andalusia (or Andaluse) was referenced multiple times by Osama Bin Laden. Nobody in the west got the reference. Everyone else did and it served to rally his followers.

Neither view is particularly accurate.  And this documentary isn't helping.",1434672000,11,1908,4.657738095238095

I have also watched a drama called Isabel which gave history from other perspective (kind of, in drama form of course).  Also saw History's Ultimate Nomads: Portugal / Spain / Brazil.  The Alhambra is beautiful and one can see the influences of three cultures at least within its design.  Understanding the roots of the Spanish language as well and how many names are derived from Arabic, such as Al Hambra, the influences between the cultures are really interesting in the makeup of Spain, Portugal, and Europe from North Africa and vice versa.  Even after 1492, the Moors influence continued until 1610 when they were kicked out of Spain.  Then came the era of privateers and their influence on the Atlantic and the New World circle of trace between the Americas, Europe, and Africa.  There is not a lot on the Moors, and so when I saw this originally,  I was appreciating being able to see the beauty of Spain and the history of a topic I did not study as much in school.  Also there are interesting books like Piracy, Slavery, and Redemption: Barbary Captivity Narratives from Early Modern England by Daniel Vitkus, that discuss the Barbary Pirates operating out of Morocco that has interesting information to continue the narrative of what happened to some of those who were kicked out of Spain and Portugal after 1610.",1429228800,,1422,4.720647773279352

What? You're still here?? What more do you want?

One interesting observation that hit me was this lady's charm. About a quarter of the way in I was being taken by her exciting facial expressions, her pleasing speaking tones, and her enthusiastic manner... and just at that moment, she went on to take a swipe at Christianity, and I snapped out of the spell. At any rate, I enjoyed some of the beautiful architecture shown, but the rest was just a video production with an agenda. The music, the video shots and sound effects, and everything else were designed to support the underlying message/agenda. As such, this is a very seductive piece. Piece of what I'll let you determine for yourself.

Oh yeah, and the one bonus is reading all of the low-information black racists in the one star review section whining because this spin was not spinning for blacks, only for islam. Sweet irony, but saddening stupidity still the same. Moors does not refer to an ethnicity of African people (though they were mixed with some African heritage), but for racists, it's all about a scorecard and trying to claim anything for ""my team"".

To some extent some of the information is true, but honestly did the Moore's, along with their agricultural knowledge really being avocados, I don't think those arrived to the old world until after 1519, being that it was a fruit from Mexico, give them credit for that, than you might as well give them credit for corn, vanilla, chocolate, etc...

3120028,5,B0013XS87U,"I am not a student of this aspect of history, but neither am I totally ignorant of this period in Spain. It is utterly ridiculous to criticize this documentary for not constantly repeating that ""Moor"" means black. Northern Africans were and still are of many 'colors' -- The dark skinned peoples of Southern Spain clearly have the genetic traces of Moorish peoples in their heritage.

If one isn't sophisticated enough to realize that the documentary is about African Islamists who invaded and changed Spanish culture, I don't know what to say.

One commenter suggested the reason the faces were struck off sculptures had to do with their black faces is being ridiculous. Unless the stone was painted over, the faces, which might have had classic features we associate with West and South Africa, would not have been colored black.

This documentary makes it clear that Moorish Islam was profoundly sophisticated, filled with scholars, valued knowledge and art and on and on. It could hardly have been more complimentary overall.

This film will upset fundamentalists of all sorts, Christian fundamentalists, Muslim fundamentalists and apparently a strain of Africanists who are intent on proving that every trace of the African race has been removed from history. Do we have a lot of rewriting of history to do? Of course, but this film definitely moves in the right direction whatever its flaws. Just looking at the Moorish architecture is worth the time it takes to watch, but there is much excellent information about Spanish heroes who were assumed to be Christian who were not. The meaning of 'moor' has always shifted. One cannot retrospectively created politically correct meanings. What we can do is trace how words were used and what they meant in different contexts. I have to admit the title of the film is misleading, but I think it was meant to be provocative and get people to ask questions about this suppressed period of history.

I was taught that European culture benefited immensely from Islamic texts and activity in Spain more than forty years ago. This is hardly a huge revelation, but if Americans want to continue to attack Islam as a dangerous religion, I guess they can work themselves into a lather over various aspects of the film.",1421971200,,2260,4.968253968253968

3120065,5,B0013XS87U,"This documentary is detested by many people primarily on the basis of the positive light it shines on Muslims and the racial makeup of the so-called Moors.

It is not true, as some reviewers have said, that Christian Europe stagnated because of Muslim attacks. Away from Spain, southern France & Italy, and Greece, no other European land at the time was being invaded or even contacted by Muslims, and the Crusades were primarily directed at the Middle East, not at Europe, so then you would expect central and Northern Europe to be excelling at arts, philosophy, etc. yet they were some of the most backward regions of Europe at the time, much more so than Italy or Greece, which were ""under siege"" by those evil raping and murderous Muslims! What a coincidence! As the video correctly states, the Muslims not just preserved ancient works, they also improved upon them and created their own contributions, just like Westerners would later preserve this ancient+Muslim knowledge and improve it and add their own accomplishments.

As for the race of the Muslims. The video is a pioneer in that it contains the new view held by more & more scholars in this field: that the Muslims after 250-300 years of Muslim rule were native Spanish converts. The first Muslims of course were mostly Berbers, with a few Arabs. Now, the Berbers were not black, neither today nor at the time of the arrival of Islam. Some reviewers here have said that the Moroccans were black, that is a big lie, the name Morocco comes from the city of Marrakesh, which means ""land of God"" in Berber. Furthermore, Moroccans today who have preserved their Berber language & identity do not look black at all, and note, many live in isolated mountainous regions, where you will not find any blacks. The only blacks in Morocco live in the country's far south or in cities and speak Arabic. Arabs of the Umayya and Abbas clans ruled (al-Andalus was almost never ruled by Berbers, much less blacks). The majority of people in al-Andalus were Muslim by the 11the century, and most of these Muslims were white Spanish converts or descendants of converts, like the video and scholars in it state, ""The Reconquista was a civil war between Spaniards of different faiths"" and ""The Spanish have been reluctant to admit that their indigenous population converted to Islam in droves"" and ""[the Spanish Muslims] were as Iberian, by blood, by DNA if you will, as their Christian cousins in the north who were kicking them out"". ""Moor"" was used in a generic sense by Spaniards & Portuguese to mean ""Muslim"". They even called Chinese, Indian, & Filipino Muslims as ""Moors"". Also, Maures means dark, not black. Moroccans were dark compared to Greco-Romans & Europeans. Almost all of the paintings of Moors as black were made by non-Spanish Europeans in the 18th to 20th centuries, over a hundred years after the last of the Muslims was kicked out of Spain. There is one or two al-Andalus-era drawings of blacks in Spain, but hundreds of others of light-skinned Muslims.

Almost no scholars in the field would say the Moors were black, most say they were Berbers bur now an increasing number of scholars, even Spanish scholars are now accepting that most of the ""Moors"" in Spain were Islamized Spaniards. Most of the people who say the Moors were black are African-Americans. I mean no disrespect, but I think that African Americans want to believe the Muslims of Spain (""Moors"") were black because of an ego issue, they want to believe that blacks once ruled and enslaved whites, since their own ancestors were once slaves to whites. There were blacks in al-Andalus, but they never made up a substantial portion of the Muslim, let alone total, population at any time. I suggest that many of those reading this research descendants of Moriscos in Morocco and Tunisia, there are great documentaries produced by Spanish television (such as ""'Somos'. La dispora andalus del Reino de Granada"" on YouTube) which show the descendants of the Muslims of Spain in Morocco & Tunisia, and they look white in most cases, but never black.
In any case, like another commenter said, if you are narrow-minded, then stick to the movie El Cid or to books by Afrocentrists.",1374105600,4,4200,4.838664812239221

3120068,5,B0013XS87U,"I found this documentary very informative and beautiful to watch.  As other reviewers have noted, this does not have as much factual information as an educated reader could learn from a text in the same time as it takes to view the film - but these media serve different purposes and, frankly, different people, or at least people with different inclinations about how they would like to spend their time.

The information I learned here does also align with what I had already learned about this period of Spain's history from other sources, so I am doubtful that she is somehow just trying to be an iconoclast for the sake of being shocking.  Rather, I suspect she takes on material that tends to be colored in one, plausibly inaccurate, light - history, as they say, is written by the victors (and sometimes the dictators, later on, like Franco).

Yes, Bettany Hughes is beautiful and is shown speaking to the camera and interviewing other people in the documentary, just as men have been and continue to do in documentaries on diverse subjects.  I am not, in the slightest, aware how her physical presence on screen detracts from the documentary, or how she is seen as self-aggrandizing.  I don't recall a single comment she made in the documentary about how intelligent she is or how much she knows or even why she knows it.  I think that this ad hominem attack is probably simply because she is a woman, period, in a male-dominated field.

I would agree with the reviewer who noted that it would be wise to discuss the contributions of the Jewish people to learning, in the time of Moorish Spain, as well as the consequences to them of the Spanish Inquisition, but I do not think it is a dramatic failing of the film.  Perhaps, in a way, the saddest part of losing that is a chance to discuss the general religious tolerance that prevailed for even a couple hundred years in a significant part of Al-Andalus.

I strongly suspect that some of the reviewers who disliked this documentary the most did so because it is an uncomfortable revision of incomplete and inaccurate information they learned earlier - and paints early relations between Christians and Muslims in a corner of Europe with a more complex palette than most dialogue would today imply is appropriate.  For instance, many still often refer to ""The Crusaders"" as a unified and somehow holy force, when it was much more of a political and economic move - and Crusaders were, overall, as likely as Saracens to fight and destroy unmercifully.

Where her points seem heavy-handed, I believe it is born out of frustration over the areas where correction is most needed.  In her documentaries, I find she tends not to make particularly any religious group look good or bad - but whomever chooses to destroy knowledge by burning and sacking centers of learning - they end up looking bad all by themselves.  It's not as if she decided that the Christian mode of conquering should include this habit, whether at Alexandria or Granada.

I am hoping to seek out additional documentaries by her and perhaps to check out a couple of her books.  If I could give her 4.5 stars, for the missing parts that I think are relevant, I would do so.  As it is, I think rounding up is appropriate, given the woeful reasons for low star reviews I find here.",1366329600,56,3302,4.675302245250432

Hello,
The fact raised by Mr. Jebril that the Moors are an ethnic African Black race is true. But also in fact one must know that the era which is called or referred to as to the Moors ruling Iberia is a total misconception. As known to all Historians that the Arabs from the Near East Area (The Levant) referred to then as the Umayyads are the ones who invaded The Iberian Peninsula and ruled for centuries. However, like many examples in history, it is only normal for great armies to be formed of different ethnic groups; and among the Umayyads army then were also Moors. I am sure that you will never find any historical Arabic book that would refer to the Moors as the invaders or the rulers of Andalusia.

3120075,5,B0013XS87U,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about Spain.  There seems to be a lot of controversy on Amazon about it but that's because those people brought their own prejudices to the review.  This is not a ""revisionist"" documentary.  It is an armchair tour of what was accomplished during the Moorish rule of Spain.  It is a beautiful tour for those of us who always wanted to go and didn't or couldn't, explaining much of Spain's history through it's architecture.  As an Art Historian, I was trained to look at art with an objective eye; sometimes it's better to know nothing about the creator, or never to have read some else's opinion.  Let the Art do the talking and see it with your own artistic sensibility.  Appreciate it for it's own sake.  That's what Art History is all about.  Most of what is said on this DVD was taught to me over thirty years ago so it's not anything new.  When Rome collapsed, Europe fragmented.  The advantage of a common language, common monetary system, excellent roads, and the protection of trade evaporated, even though the Romans had been violent and tyrannical.  Individual countries were invaded and colonized by the nearest group of barbarians.  Europe in the West was easy prey for any organized bunch and so the Moors crossed at Gibraltar into Spain.  There was little resistance, and what they found was different from their desert environment in Africa.  Spain was fertile and arable; to the invaders it was a paradise.  Was there bloodshed between the two cultures--of course.  But this is not about that.  This is about what the Moors built and created in the 600+ years they stayed.  While most of Europe was dirty, uneducated, violent and desperate, the Moors brought science, art, education and medicine to the Spanish people.  They in fact created some of the most reknown cities in the world at that time.  This was between 800 and 1492.  The rest of Europe was a nightmare where only monasteries preserved knowledge by copying it into books.  There would be nothing comparable to the civilization in Spain until the Renaissance started in Italy in the 15th century!  What the Moors created in Spain was the jewel of their empire:  the standard of living was very high and became the envy of everyone.  And that's why, the Christians wanted it back.

Can you imagine what would have happened here, in the US, if Hitler had succeeded with his planned invasion of NY?  Would he have created a beautiful civilization with magnificent architecture?  Raised the standard of living?  Educated the masses and led the world in medical care?  I don't think so, and this is what is important in the study of what happened in Spain.  The Moors did that.  This documentary left me wondering:  How much of Moorish blood is in the Spanish people today?  The Moors called Spain, ""El Andalus""--land of the Visigoths (Germans), because that is the barbarian tribe that had settled there after the fall of Rome.  The handsome people of Iberia today, must be the combination of both genetics, with their light skin, black hair, and small features.  It also made me want to go there and see it for myself.  And that's what this documentary should do:  make you think.  It's not about what is going on today in the Middle East.

We owe them a debt of gratitude for their learning and knowledge BUT the fact that they were bent on conquest and coversion is glossed over to a degree. It was a crusade

Aquinas is influenced by Averroes but is still very much an original thinker on his own in interpreting not only Greek but Roman philosophers, and making acceptable pagan philosophy which fundamentalists opposed, just because they were pagan. In Islam Averroes loses this battle.
In Catholic Europe, Aquinas popularizes faith and reason and from many of his ideas art and science flourish, but especially art. The the rest is history.

It is also a lush travelogue with stunning visuals on the amazing amount of Moorish architecture as well as building that was clearly imitative of the Islamic style. In this current Western decidedly anti Islamic climate, this is a refreshingly objective essay that portrays the Moors as they were, not as they were villified to be.

The answer, of course, is the inflexibility of a religion that stifles all innovative thought, much the same thing that happened to Christianity in Spain during the Inquisition.

I obviously find Ms. Hughes to be most offensive, very much along the lines of Justine Shapiro and Rudy Maxa, producers of some of the more egocentric travel videos that I have suffered through. Her intellectual dishonesty in presenting only one side of the story, is reprehensible. For a more polite, and detailed, discussion of these failings, read Ted Byrd's review, which justifiably has been given first place among the reviews of this video.

Visually, we are able to see some of the great structures built by the Moors: the Crdoba for one, along with a layman's explanation of the geometry that went into its construction. We are able to see ancient texts with translation and additions to Greek philosophy. But Miss Hughes went as far as interviewing the Duchess of Medina Sidonia. The Duchess pulled up documents from the 13th century showing that her ancestor -- the great Guzman El Bueno -- was a Muslim of Moorish decent. The quality of the video is sharp and Bettany Hughes style honest and engaging. We are all motivated for various reasons to find out more about Islamic/Moorish Spain, but many will leave feeling unsatisfied: it will not delve into the racial makeup of the Moors, though to some degree suggested.

In terms of historical accuracy, this film overlooks important issues like the fact that MOST of the technology and innovations supposedly ""introduced"" to Spain by Moors was, infact, INVENTED by the ancestors of these Christain Europeans in the first place. If you've ever been to Rome, then you will see ancient aqueducts built by Western Europeans many centuries before Mohammed was ever born. This irrigation technology was imported into Iberia by the Roman legions BEFORE the Western Empire fell apart in 476 AD. So there's no way Muslims, who arrived in 711 AD, can take credit for ""introducing"" this technology to Iberia. The same can be said for thought-provoking Greek philosophy and other Roman/Byzantine engineering technology.

The truth is that, during the dark ages, Europeans lost much of their Roman technological and cultural heratige BECAUSE savage Muslim hordes began raping and pillaging Christian lands. Afterall, it's hard to ponder the abstract meaning of Aristotle, or repair your own aqueducts, while a foreign army is trying to murder your son and rape your daughter. Christain Europe developed a seige mentaility in response to Muslim invasions and this same seige mentaility explains why Westerners lost so much of their cultural and technological heritage in the first place. So the Muslim armies simply stole these ideas from their western and Asian victims--whom they murdered and enslaved along the way.

CHRISTAINS VOLUNTARILY CONVERTING TO ISLAM??: This is simply not true. It did not happen this way. The truth is that many Spanish Christains found it advantageous to convert to Islam because the Muslim ruling class discriminated against their Christain subjects in ways similar to modern South Africa's Aparteid. If someone tells you that they will let you die if you don't cooperate with them, and you subsequently cooperate with them, then is this really voluntary? Ofcourse not. It is still coersion. Yet the producers of this trash would have you believe that Christains were eager to embrace this wonderful new religion and live happily ever after. While the Muslims rarely gave Christains an outright ultimatum to convert or die, refusal to convert always came at a price. At a minimum, Christians would be taxed more for keeping their religious views. Refusal to convert often lead to slavery, and occasionally death, for christain Europeans.",1244592000,52,3205,5.645228215767635
3120091,3,B0013XS87U,"Historian Bettany Hughes gives a decent, sometimes too politically correct overview of the influence of Islam on Medieval Spain.  Ms. Hughes starts her journey with the conquest of the Visigoth Kingdom by the Moors coming from North Africa at the beginning of the 8th century C.E.  She ends this journey with the fall of the Moorish Kingdom of Granada at the hands of the armies of the Catholic Monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand at the end of the 15th century C.E.  Ms. Hughes introduces her audience to the splendors of Moorish architecture in cities such as Grenada, Cordoba, and Toledo.  Ms. Hughes rightly reminds viewers about the decisive but often-ignored contribution of Moorish Spain to the European Renaissance in domains such as medicine, mathematics, and astronomy.  Italy is usually credited as the key driver for the European Renaissance.  To her credit, Ms. Hughes emphasizes that the Christian Reconquista of Moorish Spain often was about gaining land, prestige, and wealth under a veneer of religious fervor.  The Reconquista turned out to be a civil war rather than the black-and-white antagonism between Christianity and Islam that has carried the day in the popular imagination.  Many inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula converted to Islam for a variety of reasons in the centuries following the arrival of the Moors.  Ms. Hughes rightly compares the expulsion of many Muslims from Spain after 1492 C.E. with what is today understood as ethnic cleansing.  Ms. Hughes is at her weakest when she almost completely ignores the important contribution of the Jewish community to the splendor of Moorish Spain.  This lapse of judgment is somewhat surprising because Ms. Hughes rightly denounces again and again the selective interpretation that has been given to the contribution of Moorish Spain to this day.",1229385600,62,1822,5.22680412371134
3120092,4,B0013XS87U,"""When the Moors Ruled in Europe,"" is a British television documentary made for BBC4, the experimental channel, by that remarkable young woman, Bettany Hughes.  It is a real eye-opener as she travels Spain, thinking and talking about those seven centuries when the Moors, as they were known then, we would now call them Moslems, ruled the Iberian Peninsula, Spain and Portugal.

Hughes shows us their surviving, stunning architecture, in Cordoba, their capital city, Granada, even Madrid, and gives us a look at the surviving irrigation systems, by which they encouraged the arid peninsula to bloom, creating a rich agricultural economy.  She proves that, at that time and place, Islam was a great progressive force: she shows us their leadership in translating and keeping alive the Greek and Roman classics, science, medicine, marine navigation, and astronomy, and reminds us that many words in our vocabulary come from the Arabic.  She touches upon the fact that they welcomed Jews, and their knowledge.  Most important of all, she reminds us that we currently use Arabic numerals, and that the great leaps forward in bookkeeping that underlay the businesses that bankrolled the famed Renaissance of the 16th century, could never have occurred if clerks were still struggling with those clumsy Roman numerals.  Nor, of course, could Europe have rediscovered the Roman and Greek classics, another major ingredient of the Renaissance, had the Moslems not preserved them.

The presenter explains how the united monarchy of Spain in the late 15th century, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, drove the Moslems out, culminating in that great celebration of 1492, when they sent Christopher Columbus off, they thought, to find a western sea route to Asia (though, of course, it turned out America was in the way).  What's even more interesting, she shows us the costs of this long, epic battle.  Less sophisticated Moslem troops poured in to fight from North Africa: they vandalized the beautiful statuary progressive Islam had created in its 700 year rule: fundamental Islamism, as Judaism, Forbids representation of human beings, and so these troops destroyed the statues' faces.  Progressive Islam was never actually fully to recover from the know-nothingism of these soldiers; until the current day the religion, most would agree to its detriment, is dominated by fundamentalists.

But the cost to Spain was also high: it has denied and misrepresented its own history through generations of the royal family, down even to the late dictator, Francisco Franco, to minimize Arab contributions and influence.  And it created the Inquisition, to sniff out secret Arabs and Jews, marranos and moriscos, as they were called, torture and burn them alive at the stake, and, finally, expel them.  Many of these people went to the Netherlands, then a Spanish colony, where they spearheaded a great intellectual and medical flowering, another important precursor of the Renaissance, giving us such leaders as Erasmus, and Spinoza.  And many people will tell you that Spain never recovered from the forced expulsion of its best and brightest intellectual lights.

Hughes does a good job of making all this ancient history come alive, interviewing interesting people (thank goodness, the Spanish-speaking interviewees have subtitles, but I wish the whole program had), and showing us and explaining such remarkable and beautiful sights as the Arabic palace of Alhambra.  She's quite a gal, showing an interest in ancient history when she was four, studying Latin and Greek as a teenager, going to Oxford on scholarship, and going from strength to strength now.

Yes, Ms. Hughes may be very enthusiastic about Muslim accomplishments but is there anything false in her story? We need to look at things in a relative sense because every era has its way of life that we might not be able fully appreciate.  Muslims of course killed people when they were conquering lands but their atrocities were nothing compare to the prevailing attitudes of their time. They did not burn cities, books, libraries but assimilated and improved upon them.
It is also important to be very assertive about Islamic history in Europe, as Ms. Hughes did, especially because of systematic denial and manipulation of these facts.

It is not a revisionist view for most of us who have been following developments in this field for the past 25 years; it is now completely accepted among scholars that the divisions between the muslims and other groups in Spain were exaggerated in the past.  However, Islam in the middle ages was anything but marginal in its level of sophistication.

Bettany Hughes suffers from a similar disorder in ""debunking"" the Muslim-as-villain paradigm of European history. Certainly Christians handled themselves badly at many points in European history, for example in their persecution of Jews, who hadn't the power to fight back, but the Muslims had similar faults.

Hughes celebrates how Spanish cities ""voluntarily"" allowed themselves to be annexed as Muslim territory without seeing -- as she certainly would were Christian troops involved -- that they did so to avoid a worse fate in the face of overwhelming military forces.

Hughes tells us to thank the Muslims for the Arabic numeral system. Isn't she aware that the Arabs got it from the Hindus they were plundering and slaughtering in India?

It was not just due to the attractiveness of its ideas. On the positive side, she explores the contributions Muslims made in preserving and expanding upon the works of Greece and Rome and how they were transmitted to the West. I only wish she spent more time discussing Averroes, Avicenna, and other great scholars.

Bethany Hughes presents a visual documentary about Europes Iberian Peninsula, aka todays Spain and the conquered country of Al Andalus that lasted from 710 AD to 1492. Europes Medieval Period, aka The Dark Ages, lasted from the 5th to 15th century and ended with the Crusades. Andaluss conquerors discovered numerous libraries throughout the country. The books of these abundant libraries were copied from the Great Library of Egypt. Europes development accelerated because of the newfound Andalusian knowledge, and fostered Western thinking during the European Renaissance 15th to 17th century. From there, modern Europe of today formed with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia.

Bethany Hughes has other informative history documentaries. Her explanation of the pyramids of Egypt offer compelling ideas. Terry Jones, also an academic historian and a member of Britains famed Monty Python group, has many informative and entertaining documentaries about Medieval Europe. Europes history is about power and corruption, and a social order composed of the ruling elite class and a servant class. Americas founding fathers offered a change to Europes paradigm with the Declaration of Independence.  RJ-Nov 2016",1477958400,,1451,5.497757847533633

3354184,5,B0013XS87U,"A few people may be watching this presentation who may have actually not known about the history of the Moors in Spain. Most people have had the standard classes in this history. Others may have enthusiastically covered this area for their occupation or possibly just checking on ancestors.

For some people this presentation tells them what they already know however by explaining it in a different way it verifies and enhances their knowledge.

The advantage in having a one person presentation such as this is that you get that one perspective instead of a hodgepodge of soundbites by various people each with their own agenda conflict being and forcing you to choose sides instead of getting a precise picture.

The disadvantage any one person presentation is that a few people will feel that packs were left out or this is being politically correct or for some other reason has problems focusing on the fact that this presentation has a particular viewpoint that needs to be taken in consideration.

I have always liked Bettanys video presentations. However she really excels in writing and I suggest that you read Her first book Helen of Troy: Goddess, Princess, Whore to get a better feel of the presenter.

One of Bettanys strong points is her enthusiasm and energy as she points out the different locations where the history took place.

Meantime I also learned quite a few new facts to digest.

There are some excellent pictures of places in this presentation. However the background sound may sometimes drowned out what is being said.

You will definitely want to add this to your video library.",1468108800,,1606,4.9222222222222225

3354187,1,B0013XS87U,"I wanted to learn more about this topic from BOTH sides of the story.  Too bad that political correctness was more important than facts and logic in this documentary, what a waste of money and time.

First off, if you're going to be PC, be PC to everyone.  In this documentary they gave the Muslims credit for inventing the concept of a zero in mathematics and for our current number system, and brought it up multiple times.  They were trying to be so PC to the Muslims that it was a slap in the face to the people of India who were the ones that actually created these mathematical concepts and symbols (yet went entirely unmentioned), Muslims simply spread the concepts through their trade routes and massive empire.  When it came to the many mathematical contributions that Muslims actually did invent, they just glossed over that with literally a sentence or two, quite a shame.  If they can't get that right then how can I trust they did good research on anything else?

I also didn't like that they tried to paint the invasion and occupation of Spain as some sort of righteous thing, and it was deemed a ""betrayal"" when the Spaniards later re-claimed their own country.  Would the writers of this documentary think it was a betrayal when people took back their native lands from the Romans, or the Huns, or if Native Americans had taken their lands back from the invading Europeans (despite how many pretty buildings that got built, which is just paramount to these filmmakers), would that have been a ""betrayal""?  The cornerstone of the filmmakers' thinking seems to be an intersection of race/ethnicity of both the conquerors and the subjugated natives, mixed together with the current racist nature of modern Political Correctness.  Race and ethnicity shouldn't cloud one's judgment regarding the morality of taking back conquered land, or conquering other peoples' lands in the first place.

The filmmakers were awestruck with the pretty majestic buildings the Muslims built, and use them as a sign that all was well and healthy for the society and was a good thing for the Spaniards who survived the invasion.  Fantastic buildings cost what?  Money!  Where did this money come from?  In large part from the Spaniards they were ruling.  So instead of using those public funds to help the public, the funds were largely going to amazing buildings for the rulers.  How was that good for the Spaniards... seriously, how?  Throughout history, ridiculously lavish buildings or structures built in areas that aren't fantastically prosperous usually speaks to the hardship of the average citizens there, and often future failure of the society due to spending money on the wrong things (which, interestingly, is what happened to the Muslim rulers in Spain, I bet they wish they spent more on security,....hmmm...).

What also isn't even glossed over is that those horrifically lavish buildings probably were also funded by taxes they imposed in other areas of the Muslim empire as well, and quite impoverished areas at that.  They said the Muslims in Northern Africa were outraged at the decadence of the Muslims in Spain, since life for them under Muslim rule there was harsh and resources so limited.  Well yeah, if I was living in desperate poverty and yet paying taxes to build fancy palaces in far away lands, that would make me angry too.  But that second wave of invading Muslims are regarded as bad guys in this documentary.  The Muslim empire was rich for the same reason the Roman empire was rich, they took over other lands and peoples, stripped local resources in newly conquered lands, imposed steep taxes, and largely used that money on themselves (save building some fancy stuff in a few select places).  They kept running out of money so they had to keep conquering.  To me when I see those lavish buildings, I think of all the poor people throughout the Muslim empire that were exploited financially to make them.  This goes right over the heads of the filmmakers.

But hey, this whole nightmare was the most peaceful and wanted invasion of all time according to this film, despite all the people that died for it.  The filmmakers said that people gleefully turned over their property to the Muslim invaders, and that they converted to Islam in droves.  All the while the filmmakers assume it was willingly?  And how was the sale of homes gleeful, was the language of the contracts (most likely written by the Muslims conquerors), written in a gleeful way?  If they had to leave their homes back in those harsh times of mostly living off the land then hopefully there was tons of great fertile land to go to just sitting around in Spain?  And if there was a ton of great land to go to, then why did the invading Muslims need to take over people's homes in the first place, wouldn't they just go to those awesome unoccupied lands supposedly just sitting around in Spain?

And if it was the case that the people of Spain were so oppressed by their previous rulers that they were happy the Muslims were conquered, then why didn't these filmmakers explain that?  They hinted at that, but no facts presented.  What was life like in Spain for the average person before the Muslims showed up (in terms of law/order, fairness, human rights, economics, ability to progress in social/economic status, etc), and compare that to what life was like in Spain during Muslim rule, and after the Muslims were expelled.  If you want to convince me this invasion was good, then give me that comparison.  But they didn't, which means they probably don't have a good argument there, they just have pretty buildings to go on.

Lastly, it's odd that the filmmakers criticize Spanish history because it is history written by the victors, however the filmmakers' alternative version of history most likely comes from history written by the victorious Muslims during the time of the Muslim occupation (and other future writings from Muslim writers regarding the past victory), which itself was history written by the victors.  So how come history written by the victors is bad and untrustworthy when written by Spanish victors, but virtuous and true when written by the Muslim victors (despite their version of history not making logical sense)?  Again, this is the filmmakers avoiding logic and instead using political correctness to guide thought.

This documentary is so one-sided, very often illogically blinded by politically correct virtues, and so factually inept that it is a shining example of being a bad documentary.  They lose credibility within the first 10 minutes or so.  And frankly they missed an opportunity to do actual service to the Muslims that ruled Spain, which was the whole point of this documentary.  They didn't explain how life was better under Muslim rule, and the filmmakers had such little credibility by the end of the film that everything they say, even positive things about the previous Muslim rulers of Spain, has to be taken with a huge grain of salt.",1467590400,3,6984,4.872250423011844

3354225,3,B0013XS87U,"This apologetic ignores key Islamic teachings; the very teachings that fueled Islam's conquering Christians and imposing Mohammed's demand to convert, be a slave, or die. If one considers the Koran and Sunna, which teachings are as followed today among devout Muslims as in the 7th century, the video's rosy portrayal of life under Islam becomes quite suspect. The narrator's fawning view of Islamic occupation fuels her horror at backward Christians fighting to reclaim their country and culture.

At one point she acknowledges that the Muslim principle of ummah led to Muslim reinforcements coming from Africa to help quell the Christians. Ummah means that a Muslim is part of the worldwide community of Muslims. A devout Muslim's loyalty is to the ummah not to the country of residence. This in part explains why Muslims from 130 countries are fighting for Islamic State and return to their home countries to commit terror.  However, she ignores ummah as a motive for Granada's Muslims to collaborate with Turkish Muslims patrolling off the Spanish coast. Spanish understanding of unity of all Muslims against non-Muslims would be reason enough for Spain to expel Granada's and Spain's remaining Muslims.

Apologetic notwithstanding, I greatly enjoyed the video. Moorish architecture and art and Muslim contributions to the preservation of ancient knowledge and its development of new ideas are appreciated. The narrator Bettany Hughes is a physically beautiful and educated woman who can make any video interesting. She did similarly with Athens: the Truth about Democracy and many other productions. While I doubt her historical accuracy I enjoy her screen presence.

Also, the narrator would not have been tossing her hair inside the mosque unless it had not been redeemed as a Christian church (probably would have lost her nose or ears). No mention that the Christians of Spain were forced to convert to Islam, just stated that somehow they were ""convinced"" to convert. The mosque on the cover uses the alternating red and white arches that originated in Christian Byzantium over 500 years before the Muslims copied the Byzantium style. The architecture of the Hagia Sophia Christian Church built in 537 was far superior to the Islamic buildings.

All of these are magnificent.  The Moorish architecture shown is stunning.  The narrative is pretty good, although, as noted by other reviewers, it is a little slanted toward the view that the Moors were tolerant, enlightened rulers and the Christians were backward and brutal.  This is mostly true.  The Moors were pretty benevolent, and the Christians, after the Reconquista and during the Inquisition, were brutal.

3354283,5,B0013XS87U,"This past summer a small group in our church read and discussed the book ""The Ornament of the World, How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain,"" written by the late Yale Sterling Professor of Languages Rosa Menocal. Her focus was on the cultural effects of the tolerant caliphs who ruled most of  Spain from 780  to 1492.  It was a long period of intellectual freedom, collaboration among scholars from Christendom, Jews, and Muslims.

This excellent documentary drew from that work and expands on it with stunning visual images of the Moors' structures and art.  It tells a story that is overlooked.  In fact, a Spanish friend told me that Spain still, as one of the Spanish scholars in the documentary says, tries to ignore the Moorish influences and the period of intellectual rigor.",1456185600,,826,4.906474820143885

3354285,2,B0013XS87U,"This is a travelogue and architectural tour of of beautiful places in Spain erected in the middle ages.  The film shows how writings of ancient Greece were translated into Arabic in Alexandria and then copied to be studied in Toledo.  Scholars from all over Europe went to Toledo in 1200's and 1300's, providing the intellectual stimulation that culminated in the early Renaissance.

The Moors ruled the Iberian Peninsula, not Europe.  The Moors failed attempt to conquer France is touched upon by a reference to the Song of Roland. The Moorish occupation was benevolent compared to the malevolence that Ferdinand and Isabella instituted with the Inquisition.  Some of the Spanish heroes of the Reconquista were not so heroic, but mercenaries working back and forth for Spanish nobles and the Moorish conquerors.  That's shown in a talk with an old woman who's the direct descendant of Alonso Perez de Guzmn (1255 - 1309).  She lives in a castle in Cordoba with a huge library filled with original historical documents.  She shows on camera the original contract of Guzman with a Moorish noble, with the original red wax seal from 1295.",1456099200,,1136,5.00531914893617

3354287,1,B0013XS87U,"This ""documentary"" is more a commentary on the self-loathing of present-day Europeans than the state of Europe prior to the year 1492.  Ms. Hughes explains to us the most politically correct fashion that the Moors were essentially ""invited"" with ""open arms"" to invade Spain and progress onwards to France.  She bills the resistance and eventual expulsion of the Moors as the barbaric campaign, not the initial invasion itself.  She refers to the Spanish retaking their territory as ""ethnic cleansing"".  Not the inquisition, just the mere retaking gets that description.  And she acts as if many of the projects undertaken by the Muslim Moors had not been also constructed centuries before by the Romans.  Anyone with a decent and honest high school course in Western Civilization could debunk this film's assertions in real time.  I have been to Granada and Cordoba as well as many of the other locations she films, and this isn't even a good travel film, much less a historical documentary.",1456012800,6,991,5.042944785276074

With the Expulsion Decree of 1492, she  totally ignores the Jews, against whom the order was mainly written, referring only to the Muslims, forced to convert or  be banished from the land.

I thought I was well-educated on this aspect of history, but the film makes clear that what we were taught in school about the ""Reconquest"" of Spain was just plain wrong.  The relationship between the Christians and Muslims was far more subtle and multifaceted than we learned in school.  And within the Muslim faith, even way back then, there were tensions between the highly-sophisticated Muslims who brought us Arabic numbers, astronomy, Islamic poetry, and some of the best art on the planet, and those ruffians who still, today, want to storm it all down in a misguided attempt to purify their faith.  After watching this film, you will be astounded by the sophistication of the Muslim culture that inhabited southern Spain at the time of the Inquisition, and your heart will break when you realize that the ""thugs"" who tore it down came from both sides: both the Christian ""Inquisition"" thugs -- and the Muslim ""purity"" thugs -- were equally coarse, and both sides burned thousands of books about astronomy and art that are now lost to history.

3354411,2,B0013XS87U,"The purpose of this documentary appears to have been to rehabilitate the reputation of Islamic rule in Spain from the eighth through the fifteenth centuries. Although the film does contain some interesting facts and lovely images, I found it to be an extraordinarily simplistic treatment of the period and its subject. Some of the themes I perceived in this work include the following: on the whole, Muslims were broadly tolerant of all other faiths, while Christians were narrow-minded bigots; the Islamic invasion of the Iberian peninsula was entirely benign and, in some cases, the Muslims took the role of savior of the people oppressed by the Visigoths; and the flow of knowledge and culture from Islamic Spain to Christian Europe was essentially a one-way current rather than a mutually beneficial interchange.

There are elements of truth in some of the picture Bettany Hughes paints in this documentary, and it is certainly important today to remember the high points of Islamic civilization in medieval Spain. However, the viewpoint advocacy employed in this documentary leaves the viewer with skewed understanding of what we actually know about the Moors in Spain and how they interacted with their neighbors. I will only take a couple of examples to show what I mean.

First, this documentary leaves one with the impression that Islam in the Spanish medieval world was largely monolithic and tolerant, with the primary sources of tension coming from outside--from the usual Christian suspects. However, in reality, the beginning of the end of al-Andalus did not derive from Christians but from divisions within Islam. It is certainly true that many of the early rulers of al-Andalus were relatively enlightened, cultured men interested in knowledge and learning. However, it was this very tolerance, and the relaxed approach taken to Islamic law regarding matters such as consumption of alcohol, that shocked and outraged the more fundamentalist Muslims of Northern Africa who waged civil wars against the more tolerant Muslims.

A second example relates to Bettany Hughes's own outrage that Christian conquerors had converted the Great Mosque of Crdoba into a Christian cathedral--one several events which she characterizes as ethnic cleansing. However, she fails to mention that the Great Mosque itself was built on the foundation of a Catholic basilica built by the Visigoths before it was razed by the Moors.

A final example is Bettany Hughes's contention that Christians had been suspicious and very cautious of acquiring knowledge from non-Christian sources, whereas Muslims had heartily embraced learning from pagan sources. There undoubtedly were instances in which these characterizations were true. However, it is somewhat ironic that in this context Ms. Hughes mentions the capture by Islamic armies of the library at Alexandria in Egypt in the seventh century. She fails to mention that the library was reported to have been burned by Muslims in AD 642. The historicity of this event is disputed. Nevertheless, the the fact that Ms. Hughes holds forth the taking of the library as evidence of Muslim broad-mindedness, without mentioning that it may well have been the opposite, suggests that she is less interested in getting at the historical facts than in furthering her narrative. Certainly subsequent events in the Muslim world caution against sweeping generalizations that characterize tolerance as a general Islamic virtue, rather than a characteristic of some members of a unique band of its adherents in medieval Spain.

I believe that a much, much better and more balanced documentary of Islamic medieval Spain is Cities of Light: The Rise and Fall of Islamic Spain, which was produced by Unity Productions Foundation. Cities of Light is highly respectful of the remarkable achievements in al-Andalus but does not resort to the sort of black-and-white generalizations as When the Moors Ruled in Europe. Cities of Light makes the point that tolerance was not a virtue possessed by only one of the protagonists in the Iberian encounter among Muslims, Jews, and Christians, and that no party had a monopoly on violence or bigotry. It also emphasizes that studying the ""practical tolerance"" practiced at the best of times in al-Andalus may hold answers for how members of the three Abrahamic faiths can coexist peacefully today.

If you can only see one documentary on this subject, see Cities of Light, and give this one a miss.",1450656000,44,4458,5.254213483146067
3354412,4,B0013XS87U,"I would say that most of the documentary is well intended, but there is always that slight demeaning applied to most of Spain's history. The reconquest of Spain, even if it is considered an ethnic cleansing, wasn't different to those of the rest of Europe, which happened way before Spain  had done it, including the one for which Spain is most vilified, the expulsion of the Jewish people from Spain, which happened long after most countries in Europe have done it already, and was Spain where most of them arrived after it.
The reconquest was exactly that, the recuperation of their land, a fact that only can be seen through the eyes of the original people, but it is considered a theme for debate this days because Iberia was occupied for so long by the moor culture. To regain such a vast amount of land it took centuries for the Christian kingdoms to get stronger enough to win their war and to take advantage of the dissolution of the Caliphate. The means to reconquest by the Christians were the same applied by any other kingdom anywhere in the known world of that era, which was an era of violence and conquest.
In regards of the cultural legacy of the Islamic world left in Spain, it was in-mensurable, and definitively, without it Europe would had never develop the way it did, unfortunately also, it could not had happened without the reconquest of Iberia where that wealth of lost and new knowledge was open to the whole world.
The lost of the Iberian peninsula by the Islamic world and regaining of it by the christian world was just another story of conquest and reconquest which fills our history books, whereas they are just or unjust stories. It does not have a Black or White areas, it is just the history of man kind and like it or not, it is the history of Spain not the other way around.",1449964800,,1810,4.535168195718654

3354414,1,B0013XS87U,"Impure garbage of whites without spines sucking up to Muslims by rewriting history. The argument goes like this the Moors had great palaces and  buildings made with meaning therefore every bad thing you have heard and people wrote down who were witnesses is false. What do palaces and architecture tell you about the people? This kind of flawed study and methodology is based on post modern thinking of self doubting self hating leftist who side with enemies of their own people always under the masquerade of pseudo scholarly skepticism. Skepticism and actual hostile bias against the actual chronicles and witnesses of the past and replacing it with vacuous love of archeology. They justify this to themselves beforehand as a matter of principle by assuming bias in written accounts, which is itself a dangerous bias. This has led to the discounting of the important records and words from history that tell us how brutal the Muslims were as we see evidenced today. So this poor quality and dated piece of enemy within style bunk that sides with enemies totally skips over the fact that the Moors were foreigner who invaded and took over other peoples lands and made them subject to them and have to submit to humiliating penalties and rules like paying a jizya, and sharia in order to live.

Therin lies the difference between her-story and truth. But few are interested in the truth when it negates their alleged superiority.

3354476,2,B0013XS87U,"I despise this style of pop history documentary.

1. They must insinuate that some deep mystery is about to be revealed based on recent evidence. Nonsense in this case. This history is well known, and much of what was burned when the nutters took over had made its way out when Toledo changed hands in the 12th century.

2. Works so hard to engage you that you can see it sweat. Between jump cuts the presenter is trying to seduce the camera and, sorry, she's just not my type. A couple of times I found myself trying to back up as she moved toward the camera and, once, I even flinched. Or maybe the camera was zooming in....I was so busy ducking and flinching I may have failed to notice.

3. Simplifies to the point of laughable inaccuracy. The term, Moors, is such an example, as others have noted. Many people migrated to Spain in this period because Rome had been totaled multiple times by this point and the rest of Europe was living in their own filth.

4. Uh....Jews? They were not a footnote in Spain, they spoke their own language - Ladino: a mixture of Hebrew and Medieval Spanish which is still spoken in some communities in Israel - and many of their descendants' families still have the keys to their houses.

This subject deserves better. The western notion of this period is awash with lunacy as is, frankly, the eastern one. Two data points. First, the 1961 Anthony Mann film, El Cid, starring Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren. Only good thing you can say about it is that, oh my god, did Sophia Loren look good. Had it been her presenting this documentary I would leaned toward the screen....sorry...got a little distracted there.

And, second, Andalusia (or Andaluse) was referenced multiple times by Osama Bin Laden. Nobody in the west got the reference. Everyone else did and it served to rally his followers.

Neither view is particularly accurate.  And this documentary isn't helping.",1434672000,11,1908,4.657738095238095
3354477,5,B0013XS87U,"Very good documentary that opened my eyes to the amount of lies and deception westerners are fed as facts.

3354478,4,B0013XS87U,Good DVD.  Would have given it 5 stars if Bethany would have stop telling me that the Moors were Muslim.  That is not true during the first 400 years of  conquering Spain.  Mohammedanism came 1100 AD not 711 AD.,1434412800,,211,4.333333333333333

3354498,5,B0013XS87U,"I think the same host did a tour of the Alhambra in another documentary.  I got a lot from both.  I have also watched a drama called Isabel which gave history from other perspective (kind of, in drama form of course).  Also saw History's Ultimate Nomads: Portugal / Spain / Brazil.  The Alhambra is beautiful and one can see the influences of three cultures at least within its design.  Understanding the roots of the Spanish language as well and how many names are derived from Arabic, such as Al Hambra, the influences between the cultures are really interesting in the makeup of Spain, Portugal, and Europe from North Africa and vice versa.  Even after 1492, the Moors influence continued until 1610 when they were kicked out of Spain.  Then came the era of privateers and their influence on the Atlantic and the New World circle of trace between the Americas, Europe, and Africa.  There is not a lot on the Moors, and so when I saw this originally,  I was appreciating being able to see the beauty of Spain and the history of a topic I did not study as much in school.  Also there are interesting books like Piracy, Slavery, and Redemption: Barbary Captivity Narratives from Early Modern England by Daniel Vitkus, that discuss the Barbary Pirates operating out of Morocco that has interesting information to continue the narrative of what happened to some of those who were kicked out of Spain and Portugal after 1610.",1429228800,,1422,4.720647773279352

What? You're still here?? What more do you want?

One interesting observation that hit me was this lady's charm. About a quarter of the way in I was being taken by her exciting facial expressions, her pleasing speaking tones, and her enthusiastic manner... and just at that moment, she went on to take a swipe at Christianity, and I snapped out of the spell. At any rate, I enjoyed some of the beautiful architecture shown, but the rest was just a video production with an agenda. The music, the video shots and sound effects, and everything else were designed to support the underlying message/agenda. As such, this is a very seductive piece. Piece of what I'll let you determine for yourself.

Oh yeah, and the one bonus is reading all of the low-information black racists in the one star review section whining because this spin was not spinning for blacks, only for islam. Sweet irony, but saddening stupidity still the same. Moors does not refer to an ethnicity of African people (though they were mixed with some African heritage), but for racists, it's all about a scorecard and trying to claim anything for ""my team"".

This seems to really sympathize with the Moorish/Arabic culture as having brought a lot of knowledge and light not only to Spain, but medival/dark age Europe.
To some extent some of the information is true, but honestly did the Moore's, along with their agricultural knowledge really being avocados, I don't think those arrived to the old world until after 1519, being that it was a fruit from Mexico, give them credit for that, than you might as well give them credit for corn, vanilla, chocolate, etc...

3354525,5,B0013XS87U,"I am not a student of this aspect of history, but neither am I totally ignorant of this period in Spain. It is utterly ridiculous to criticize this documentary for not constantly repeating that ""Moor"" means black. Northern Africans were and still are of many 'colors' -- The dark skinned peoples of Southern Spain clearly have the genetic traces of Moorish peoples in their heritage.

If one isn't sophisticated enough to realize that the documentary is about African Islamists who invaded and changed Spanish culture, I don't know what to say.

One commenter suggested the reason the faces were struck off sculptures had to do with their black faces is being ridiculous. Unless the stone was painted over, the faces, which might have had classic features we associate with West and South Africa, would not have been colored black.

This documentary makes it clear that Moorish Islam was profoundly sophisticated, filled with scholars, valued knowledge and art and on and on. It could hardly have been more complimentary overall.

This film will upset fundamentalists of all sorts, Christian fundamentalists, Muslim fundamentalists and apparently a strain of Africanists who are intent on proving that every trace of the African race has been removed from history. Do we have a lot of rewriting of history to do? Of course, but this film definitely moves in the right direction whatever its flaws. Just looking at the Moorish architecture is worth the time it takes to watch, but there is much excellent information about Spanish heroes who were assumed to be Christian who were not. The meaning of 'moor' has always shifted. One cannot retrospectively created politically correct meanings. What we can do is trace how words were used and what they meant in different contexts. I have to admit the title of the film is misleading, but I think it was meant to be provocative and get people to ask questions about this suppressed period of history.

I was taught that European culture benefited immensely from Islamic texts and activity in Spain more than forty years ago. This is hardly a huge revelation, but if Americans want to continue to attack Islam as a dangerous religion, I guess they can work themselves into a lather over various aspects of the film.",1421971200,,2260,4.968253968253968

3354562,5,B0013XS87U,"This documentary is detested by many people primarily on the basis of the positive light it shines on Muslims and the racial makeup of the so-called Moors.

It is not true, as some reviewers have said, that Christian Europe stagnated because of Muslim attacks. Away from Spain, southern France & Italy, and Greece, no other European land at the time was being invaded or even contacted by Muslims, and the Crusades were primarily directed at the Middle East, not at Europe, so then you would expect central and Northern Europe to be excelling at arts, philosophy, etc. yet they were some of the most backward regions of Europe at the time, much more so than Italy or Greece, which were ""under siege"" by those evil raping and murderous Muslims! What a coincidence! As the video correctly states, the Muslims not just preserved ancient works, they also improved upon them and created their own contributions, just like Westerners would later preserve this ancient+Muslim knowledge and improve it and add their own accomplishments.

As for the race of the Muslims. The video is a pioneer in that it contains the new view held by more & more scholars in this field: that the Muslims after 250-300 years of Muslim rule were native Spanish converts. The first Muslims of course were mostly Berbers, with a few Arabs. Now, the Berbers were not black, neither today nor at the time of the arrival of Islam. Some reviewers here have said that the Moroccans were black, that is a big lie, the name Morocco comes from the city of Marrakesh, which means ""land of God"" in Berber. Furthermore, Moroccans today who have preserved their Berber language & identity do not look black at all, and note, many live in isolated mountainous regions, where you will not find any blacks. The only blacks in Morocco live in the country's far south or in cities and speak Arabic. Arabs of the Umayya and Abbas clans ruled (al-Andalus was almost never ruled by Berbers, much less blacks). The majority of people in al-Andalus were Muslim by the 11the century, and most of these Muslims were white Spanish converts or descendants of converts, like the video and scholars in it state, ""The Reconquista was a civil war between Spaniards of different faiths"" and ""The Spanish have been reluctant to admit that their indigenous population converted to Islam in droves"" and ""[the Spanish Muslims] were as Iberian, by blood, by DNA if you will, as their Christian cousins in the north who were kicking them out"". ""Moor"" was used in a generic sense by Spaniards & Portuguese to mean ""Muslim"". They even called Chinese, Indian, & Filipino Muslims as ""Moors"". Also, Maures means dark, not black. Moroccans were dark compared to Greco-Romans & Europeans. Almost all of the paintings of Moors as black were made by non-Spanish Europeans in the 18th to 20th centuries, over a hundred years after the last of the Muslims was kicked out of Spain. There is one or two al-Andalus-era drawings of blacks in Spain, but hundreds of others of light-skinned Muslims.

Almost no scholars in the field would say the Moors were black, most say they were Berbers bur now an increasing number of scholars, even Spanish scholars are now accepting that most of the ""Moors"" in Spain were Islamized Spaniards. Most of the people who say the Moors were black are African-Americans. I mean no disrespect, but I think that African Americans want to believe the Muslims of Spain (""Moors"") were black because of an ego issue, they want to believe that blacks once ruled and enslaved whites, since their own ancestors were once slaves to whites. There were blacks in al-Andalus, but they never made up a substantial portion of the Muslim, let alone total, population at any time. I suggest that many of those reading this research descendants of Moriscos in Morocco and Tunisia, there are great documentaries produced by Spanish television (such as ""'Somos'. La dispora andalus del Reino de Granada"" on YouTube) which show the descendants of the Muslims of Spain in Morocco & Tunisia, and they look white in most cases, but never black.
In any case, like another commenter said, if you are narrow-minded, then stick to the movie El Cid or to books by Afrocentrists.",1374105600,4,4200,4.838664812239221

3354565,5,B0013XS87U,"I found this documentary very informative and beautiful to watch.  As other reviewers have noted, this does not have as much factual information as an educated reader could learn from a text in the same time as it takes to view the film - but these media serve different purposes and, frankly, different people, or at least people with different inclinations about how they would like to spend their time.

The information I learned here does also align with what I had already learned about this period of Spain's history from other sources, so I am doubtful that she is somehow just trying to be an iconoclast for the sake of being shocking.  Rather, I suspect she takes on material that tends to be colored in one, plausibly inaccurate, light - history, as they say, is written by the victors (and sometimes the dictators, later on, like Franco).

Yes, Bettany Hughes is beautiful and is shown speaking to the camera and interviewing other people in the documentary, just as men have been and continue to do in documentaries on diverse subjects.  I am not, in the slightest, aware how her physical presence on screen detracts from the documentary, or how she is seen as self-aggrandizing.  I don't recall a single comment she made in the documentary about how intelligent she is or how much she knows or even why she knows it.  I think that this ad hominem attack is probably simply because she is a woman, period, in a male-dominated field.

I would agree with the reviewer who noted that it would be wise to discuss the contributions of the Jewish people to learning, in the time of Moorish Spain, as well as the consequences to them of the Spanish Inquisition, but I do not think it is a dramatic failing of the film.  Perhaps, in a way, the saddest part of losing that is a chance to discuss the general religious tolerance that prevailed for even a couple hundred years in a significant part of Al-Andalus.

I strongly suspect that some of the reviewers who disliked this documentary the most did so because it is an uncomfortable revision of incomplete and inaccurate information they learned earlier - and paints early relations between Christians and Muslims in a corner of Europe with a more complex palette than most dialogue would today imply is appropriate.  For instance, many still often refer to ""The Crusaders"" as a unified and somehow holy force, when it was much more of a political and economic move - and Crusaders were, overall, as likely as Saracens to fight and destroy unmercifully.

Where her points seem heavy-handed, I believe it is born out of frustration over the areas where correction is most needed.  In her documentaries, I find she tends not to make particularly any religious group look good or bad - but whomever chooses to destroy knowledge by burning and sacking centers of learning - they end up looking bad all by themselves.  It's not as if she decided that the Christian mode of conquering should include this habit, whether at Alexandria or Granada.

I am hoping to seek out additional documentaries by her and perhaps to check out a couple of her books.  If I could give her 4.5 stars, for the missing parts that I think are relevant, I would do so.  As it is, I think rounding up is appropriate, given the woeful reasons for low star reviews I find here.",1366329600,56,3302,4.675302245250432

Hello,
The fact raised by Mr. Jebril that the Moors are an ethnic African Black race is true. But also in fact one must know that the era which is called or referred to as to the Moors ruling Iberia is a total misconception. As known to all Historians that the Arabs from the Near East Area (The Levant) referred to then as the Umayyads are the ones who invaded The Iberian Peninsula and ruled for centuries. However, like many examples in history, it is only normal for great armies to be formed of different ethnic groups; and among the Umayyads army then were also Moors. I am sure that you will never find any historical Arabic book that would refer to the Moors as the invaders or the rulers of Andalusia.

There seems to be a lot of controversy on Amazon about it but that's because those people brought their own prejudices to the review.  This is not a ""revisionist"" documentary.  It is an armchair tour of what was accomplished during the Moorish rule of Spain.  It is a beautiful tour for those of us who always wanted to go and didn't or couldn't, explaining much of Spain's history through it's architecture.  As an Art Historian, I was trained to look at art with an objective eye; sometimes it's better to know nothing about the creator, or never to have read some else's opinion.  Let the Art do the talking and see it with your own artistic sensibility.  Appreciate it for it's own sake.  That's what Art History is all about.  Most of what is said on this DVD was taught to me over thirty years ago so it's not anything new.  When Rome collapsed, Europe fragmented.  The advantage of a common language, common monetary system, excellent roads, and the protection of trade evaporated, even though the Romans had been violent and tyrannical.  Individual countries were invaded and colonized by the nearest group of barbarians.  Europe in the West was easy prey for any organized bunch and so the Moors crossed at Gibraltar into Spain.  There was little resistance, and what they found was different from their desert environment in Africa.  Spain was fertile and arable; to the invaders it was a paradise.  Was there bloodshed between the two cultures--of course.  But this is not about that.  This is about what the Moors built and created in the 600+ years they stayed.  While most of Europe was dirty, uneducated, violent and desperate, the Moors brought science, art, education and medicine to the Spanish people.  They in fact created some of the most reknown cities in the world at that time.  This was between 800 and 1492.  The rest of Europe was a nightmare where only monasteries preserved knowledge by copying it into books.  There would be nothing comparable to the civilization in Spain until the Renaissance started in Italy in the 15th century!  What the Moors created in Spain was the jewel of their empire:  the standard of living was very high and became the envy of everyone.  And that's why, the Christians wanted it back.

Can you imagine what would have happened here, in the US, if Hitler had succeeded with his planned invasion of NY?  Would he have created a beautiful civilization with magnificent architecture?  Raised the standard of living?  Educated the masses and led the world in medical care?  I don't think so, and this is what is important in the study of what happened in Spain.  The Moors did that.  This documentary left me wondering:  How much of Moorish blood is in the Spanish people today?  The Moors called Spain, ""El Andalus""--land of the Visigoths (Germans), because that is the barbarian tribe that had settled there after the fall of Rome.  The handsome people of Iberia today, must be the combination of both genetics, with their light skin, black hair, and small features.  It also made me want to go there and see it for myself.  And that's what this documentary should do:  make you think.  It's not about what is going on today in the Middle East.

In Islam Averroes loses this battle.
In Catholic Europe, Aquinas popularizes faith and reason and from many of his ideas art and science flourish, but especially art. The the rest is history.

The answer, of course, is the inflexibility of a religion that stifles all innovative thought, much the same thing that happened to Christianity in Spain during the Inquisition.

I obviously find Ms. Hughes to be most offensive, very much along the lines of Justine Shapiro and Rudy Maxa, producers of some of the more egocentric travel videos that I have suffered through. Her intellectual dishonesty in presenting only one side of the story, is reprehensible. For a more polite, and detailed, discussion of these failings, read Ted Byrd's review, which justifiably has been given first place among the reviews of this video.

Visually, we are able to see some of the great structures built by the Moors: the Crdoba for one, along with a layman's explanation of the geometry that went into its construction. We are able to see ancient texts with translation and additions to Greek philosophy. But Miss Hughes went as far as interviewing the Duchess of Medina Sidonia. The Duchess pulled up documents from the 13th century showing that her ancestor -- the great Guzman El Bueno -- was a Muslim of Moorish decent. The quality of the video is sharp and Bettany Hughes style honest and engaging. We are all motivated for various reasons to find out more about Islamic/Moorish Spain, but many will leave feeling unsatisfied: it will not delve into the racial makeup of the Moors, though to some degree suggested.

In terms of historical accuracy, this film overlooks important issues like the fact that MOST of the technology and innovations supposedly ""introduced"" to Spain by Moors was, infact, INVENTED by the ancestors of these Christain Europeans in the first place. If you've ever been to Rome, then you will see ancient aqueducts built by Western Europeans many centuries before Mohammed was ever born. This irrigation technology was imported into Iberia by the Roman legions BEFORE the Western Empire fell apart in 476 AD. So there's no way Muslims, who arrived in 711 AD, can take credit for ""introducing"" this technology to Iberia. The same can be said for thought-provoking Greek philosophy and other Roman/Byzantine engineering technology.

The truth is that, during the dark ages, Europeans lost much of their Roman technological and cultural heratige BECAUSE savage Muslim hordes began raping and pillaging Christian lands. Afterall, it's hard to ponder the abstract meaning of Aristotle, or repair your own aqueducts, while a foreign army is trying to murder your son and rape your daughter. Christain Europe developed a seige mentaility in response to Muslim invasions and this same seige mentaility explains why Westerners lost so much of their cultural and technological heritage in the first place. So the Muslim armies simply stole these ideas from their western and Asian victims--whom they murdered and enslaved along the way.

CHRISTAINS VOLUNTARILY CONVERTING TO ISLAM??: This is simply not true. It did not happen this way. The truth is that many Spanish Christains found it advantageous to convert to Islam because the Muslim ruling class discriminated against their Christain subjects in ways similar to modern South Africa's Aparteid. If someone tells you that they will let you die if you don't cooperate with them, and you subsequently cooperate with them, then is this really voluntary? Ofcourse not. It is still coersion. Yet the producers of this trash would have you believe that Christains were eager to embrace this wonderful new religion and live happily ever after. While the Muslims rarely gave Christains an outright ultimatum to convert or die, refusal to convert always came at a price. At a minimum, Christians would be taxed more for keeping their religious views. Refusal to convert often lead to slavery, and occasionally death, for christain Europeans.",1244592000,52,3205,5.645228215767635
3354588,3,B0013XS87U,"Historian Bettany Hughes gives a decent, sometimes too politically correct overview of the influence of Islam on Medieval Spain.  Ms. Hughes starts her journey with the conquest of the Visigoth Kingdom by the Moors coming from North Africa at the beginning of the 8th century C.E.  She ends this journey with the fall of the Moorish Kingdom of Granada at the hands of the armies of the Catholic Monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand at the end of the 15th century C.E.  Ms. Hughes introduces her audience to the splendors of Moorish architecture in cities such as Grenada, Cordoba, and Toledo.  Ms. Hughes rightly reminds viewers about the decisive but often-ignored contribution of Moorish Spain to the European Renaissance in domains such as medicine, mathematics, and astronomy.  Italy is usually credited as the key driver for the European Renaissance.  To her credit, Ms. Hughes emphasizes that the Christian Reconquista of Moorish Spain often was about gaining land, prestige, and wealth under a veneer of religious fervor.  The Reconquista turned out to be a civil war rather than the black-and-white antagonism between Christianity and Islam that has carried the day in the popular imagination.  Many inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula converted to Islam for a variety of reasons in the centuries following the arrival of the Moors.  Ms. Hughes rightly compares the expulsion of many Muslims from Spain after 1492 C.E. with what is today understood as ethnic cleansing.  Ms. Hughes is at her weakest when she almost completely ignores the important contribution of the Jewish community to the splendor of Moorish Spain.  This lapse of judgment is somewhat surprising because Ms. Hughes rightly denounces again and again the selective interpretation that has been given to the contribution of Moorish Spain to this day.",1229385600,62,1822,5.22680412371134
3354589,4,B0013XS87U,"""When the Moors Ruled in Europe,"" is a British television documentary made for BBC4, the experimental channel, by that remarkable young woman, Bettany Hughes.  It is a real eye-opener as she travels Spain, thinking and talking about those seven centuries when the Moors, as they were known then, we would now call them Moslems, ruled the Iberian Peninsula, Spain and Portugal.

Hughes shows us their surviving, stunning architecture, in Cordoba, their capital city, Granada, even Madrid, and gives us a look at the surviving irrigation systems, by which they encouraged the arid peninsula to bloom, creating a rich agricultural economy.  She proves that, at that time and place, Islam was a great progressive force: she shows us their leadership in translating and keeping alive the Greek and Roman classics, science, medicine, marine navigation, and astronomy, and reminds us that many words in our vocabulary come from the Arabic.  She touches upon the fact that they welcomed Jews, and their knowledge.  Most important of all, she reminds us that we currently use Arabic numerals, and that the great leaps forward in bookkeeping that underlay the businesses that bankrolled the famed Renaissance of the 16th century, could never have occurred if clerks were still struggling with those clumsy Roman numerals.  Nor, of course, could Europe have rediscovered the Roman and Greek classics, another major ingredient of the Renaissance, had the Moslems not preserved them.

The presenter explains how the united monarchy of Spain in the late 15th century, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, drove the Moslems out, culminating in that great celebration of 1492, when they sent Christopher Columbus off, they thought, to find a western sea route to Asia (though, of course, it turned out America was in the way).  What's even more interesting, she shows us the costs of this long, epic battle.  Less sophisticated Moslem troops poured in to fight from North Africa: they vandalized the beautiful statuary progressive Islam had created in its 700 year rule: fundamental Islamism, as Judaism, Forbids representation of human beings, and so these troops destroyed the statues' faces.  Progressive Islam was never actually fully to recover from the know-nothingism of these soldiers; until the current day the religion, most would agree to its detriment, is dominated by fundamentalists.

But the cost to Spain was also high: it has denied and misrepresented its own history through generations of the royal family, down even to the late dictator, Francisco Franco, to minimize Arab contributions and influence.  And it created the Inquisition, to sniff out secret Arabs and Jews, marranos and moriscos, as they were called, torture and burn them alive at the stake, and, finally, expel them.  Many of these people went to the Netherlands, then a Spanish colony, where they spearheaded a great intellectual and medical flowering, another important precursor of the Renaissance, giving us such leaders as Erasmus, and Spinoza.  And many people will tell you that Spain never recovered from the forced expulsion of its best and brightest intellectual lights.

Hughes does a good job of making all this ancient history come alive, interviewing interesting people (thank goodness, the Spanish-speaking interviewees have subtitles, but I wish the whole program had), and showing us and explaining such remarkable and beautiful sights as the Arabic palace of Alhambra.  She's quite a gal, showing an interest in ancient history when she was four, studying Latin and Greek as a teenager, going to Oxford on scholarship, and going from strength to strength now.

Yes, Ms. Hughes may be very enthusiastic about Muslim accomplishments but is there anything false in her story? We need to look at things in a relative sense because every era has its way of life that we might not be able fully appreciate.  Muslims of course killed people when they were conquering lands but their atrocities were nothing compare to the prevailing attitudes of their time. They did not burn cities, books, libraries but assimilated and improved upon them.
It is also important to be very assertive about Islamic history in Europe, as Ms. Hughes did, especially because of systematic denial and manipulation of these facts.

Rather than cultural bias, historical pragmatics are at the heart of this somewhat new approach to Spain under Muslim rule.  It is not a revisionist view for most of us who have been following developments in this field for the past 25 years; it is now completely accepted among scholars that the divisions between the muslims and other groups in Spain were exaggerated in the past.  However, Islam in the middle ages was anything but marginal in its level of sophistication.  What better way to demonstrate this than with the wonderfully technical yet never dry diagrams of the Alhambra in this film.

Bettany Hughes suffers from a similar disorder in ""debunking"" the Muslim-as-villain paradigm of European history. Certainly Christians handled themselves badly at many points in European history, for example in their persecution of Jews, who hadn't the power to fight back, but the Muslims had similar faults.

Hughes celebrates how Spanish cities ""voluntarily"" allowed themselves to be annexed as Muslim territory without seeing -- as she certainly would were Christian troops involved -- that they did so to avoid a worse fate in the face of overwhelming military forces.

Hughes tells us to thank the Muslims for the Arabic numeral system. Isn't she aware that the Arabs got it from the Hindus they were plundering and slaughtering in India?
