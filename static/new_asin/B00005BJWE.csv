1424485,5,B00005BJWE,"THe first time I saw this movie I was in middle school, it amazed me of how a 13 year old girl did what she did to land her Father's private jet in the middle of a crisis. The control panel was damaged, there was a big hole in the wall of the cabin, everybody on board was unconscious, and no one knew what to do so it was up to this young girl Nicole Stone to lead them to safety. A big CONGRATULATIONS on Elisha Cuthbert on her amazing role in the movie Air Speed, she did a great job and I hope to see more of her movies to come.",1393372800,,532,3.7589285714285716

1424487,4,B00005BJWE,"I am a firm believer in family films. This is certainly one of them.  I could write  a college dissertation on all the mistakes.  It makes the TITANIC mistakes look non existent.  However, I do think parts of it were great and over all it seemed wonderful to see a family film that didn't have adult themes in it.  I felt that the father played by Joe Mantegna, the Air Traffic Controller played by Jeff Powell and of course Nicole, the hero, played by Elisha Cuthbert all did an ou statnding job.  Especially Elisha in one of her first movies. The only swearing I even heard was Nicole, as the plane was landing yells OHHHHH SH....and they cut to a different scene.  However, any child over the age of 5 knows what she really said.  My biggest problem with the movie ha d nothing to do with mistakes, well except in hiring the wrong actress.  The mother, to me , was a mother from hell. Her screaming reminds me of fingernails on a chalkboard. I think If I were Nicole I would rebel too, or at least get my Dad to run away. The worst part was the mother constantly asking if Nicole had been rescued when there was no way for Jeff (the ATC) to possibly know.  In addition if anyone had heard Nicole (of course parents never listen to teenagers(, they would know that she said several times that she could get people off faster if she helped.

All in n for a family film I give it 4 stars., but I  hope the mother never worked in a family film again.",1383436800,2,1449,4.248175182481752
1424488,5,B00005BJWE,"Don't listen to any of the putdowns about this movie, it is suspenseful and one great movie, Elisha Cuthbert does a fantastic job. I purchased this for my granddaughter and like it so much I'm going to buy another copy for myself. It is a movie the whole family can watch and enjoy.",1365465600,,282,4.339622641509434

1424490,1,B00005BJWE,"This is the same old airplane disaster movie. There is nothing new, not even snakes or parody. i don't want to anticipate the end, but it's predictable anyway.",1352937600,,159,4.714285714285714
1424491,3,B00005BJWE,"There have been quite a number of movies about aircraft in jeopardy where the pilots are disabled or the plane's controls are too damaged to fly the plane.  We saw this plot in ""Airport '75"" and in ""Air Force 1.""  This time a lightning strike has damaged the plane and knocked the pilots out.  The same lightning strike ripped a hole in the side of the plane and disabled two of the three passengers, leaving 13-year-old Nicole Stone to fend for herself on the disabled plane.

At the beginning of the movie we learn that Nicole's father Raymond (Joe Mantegna) and mother Marylin (Lynne Adams) have been so focused on starting their business that they have been neglecting poor little rich girl Nicole.  Nicole is on her way to mom and dad in the winter, in mom and dad's private plane, when the plane encounters a thunderstorm.  Up to this point the movie was reasonably plausible.

The pilots decide it might be wiser to go around the thunderstorm.  Unfortunately, the pilots made this decision after they were in the thunderstorm, and a bolt of lightning wreaks havoc on the plane, knocking out the pilots and playing can opener with the fuselage.  Nicole had been fortuitously fooling around with the first aid kit and was wearing oxygen when all this happened, so she is the only person still in good condition after the lightning strike.  Unfortunately, the first aid kit smacked the other two passengers of the plane, injuring both.

Passenger and guardian Andrea Prescott (Bronwn Booth) regains consciousness long enough to get to the cockpit, but she is ineffective and passes out again.  Nicole is accidentally able to communicate with the control tower of the airport where the plane is headed.  The control tower convinces the Air Force to send a KC-135 to try and board the plane mid-air and transfer passengers to the KC-135.  At this point in the movie the implausibilities mount one after another.  The cockpit of the KC-135 has a few instruments, as opposed to a real KC-135 cockpit.  The interior of the 727 appears to be much bigger than the real thing.  The cable used to connect the two planes frays in minutes.  If real Air Force people were conducting this operation they would have been court-martialed.

Soon after the third person is transferred from the 727 to the KC-135, the cable frays where it is attached to the 727 and the winch back at the KC-135 pulls the Air Force person in the 727 out of the plane and into free fall.  Lucky for him he was wearing a parachute.

During all the action the radio in the plane shot sparks and died, but Nicole belatedly remembers that Andrea has a cell phone.  Nicole uses the cell phone to call the tower and say how she was afraid and mom and dad reassure her that she was going to pull through; a tender moment that can bring tears to your eyes.  Nicole then bucks up and tries to figure out how to turn off the autopilot (which the air traffic controller assures everyone in the tower would require an aeronautical engineer to do), fly the plane, and then land, without ever having driven a car.  Can Nicole do all this in the last fifteen minutes of the movie?  Watch and find out.

There are moments when the acting is reasonably good, but as the tension escalates, so does the bad acting.  There was a point where I was tempted to stop watching, but I had to see this movie out.  After the overacting that occurred after the two planes separated, the movie settled down and the ending did capture my attention.

Movies that gloss over technical details a lot annoy me, and this movie does that to excess.  Essentially, it would have been impossible for the two planes to fly as close together as they did (scoffers would ask how refueling occurs - two different altitudes; the 727 and the KC-135 were at the same altitude for some time, only yards apart; the turbulence from the four-engine KC-135 should have caused significant flight problems for the 727).  The other aspects shown, such as having someone crawl up the landing gear while the plane is in flight, should have been a nightmare in the 200+ mph wind stream.  But, if you can ignore the numerous implausibilities, and you can make it to the ending, it turns out to be an okay movie.",1142121600,,4220,4.607764390896921
1424492,3,B00005BJWE,"Millionaire's private plane with bratty 13-yr.-old daughter and father's friends aboard is struck by lightning knocking pilots unconscious, leaving it up to the daughter, Nicole, to fly the plane and land it safely. This movie has parts borrowed from other movies, but that's ok: private plane (Airport '77), daughter on board, refueler plane, and rescue to get people off plane (Air Force One), turbulance from one plane near another (Executive Decision), Lightning hits plane (Panic in the Skies), and finally -- and one which the ""reference"" is actually mentioned in the dialogue -- female takes control of the plane and professional talks her through flying the plane (Airport 1975). One of my favorite lines in this movie is when Nicole says, ""Charlton Heston? Let's make it Brad Pitt."" Another of my favorite lines is when the Air traffic Controller asks Nicole, ""What's your status?"" she answers, ""My status? My status sux!"" While it is somewhat implausible for a teenager to actually fly the plane, her actions, her reactions, her attitude (i.e. ""The auto-pilot is p*ssing me off!"" as she grabs a bat to use to disengage the stubborn auto-pilot), and what she says is very real and believable. It is not one of the best airplane disaster movies, but it is not bad either. It is very watchable and worth watching.",1112227200,5,1320,4.97737556561086
1424493,4,B00005BJWE,"This was an easy to watch air disaster movie with some fairly good acting and only a small amount of ham from the hysterical parents of the 13 year old girl trapped on the out of control plane.

Joe Mantegna plays the frightened father whose money and high social position can't buy his bratty but surprisingly likable daughter's safety and the little known actress Lynne Adams gives a good rendition of a distraught mother in waiting.

Of course the whole situation is highly implausible but despite this it does make good watching if you want something pretty brainless and far fetched to get your teeth into.

The best acting was by far the young Air Traffic Controller along with Elisha Cuthbert who plays the girl in danger and there is no blood and gore to make you flinch, and the special effects though minimal are pretty good.

 The plot is standard disaster fare which follows thus, girl in mortal danger, people rally around to save girl, more problems arise, more thinking is done in which amazing answers to all the dilemmas spring forward from various peoples minds and lips, disposable people in film are saved by girl (or they die, depends on the movie really!), and finally girl in a bid to save her friend left on plane when rescue attempt goes wrong ends up flying the plane and lands it safely!

 Like I said totally implausible but still good cheesy popcorn watching and worth the four stars just for that alone!",1090800000,,1433,4.662698412698413
1424494,2,B00005BJWE,"Not much new here. It's all been done before. The title says it all. Same plots, for the most part. You're better off getting Airport 1975 and, if you must, Speed 2. Good for an afternoon popcorn movie though. Just make sure you have enough to keep you occupied.",998784000,3,262,4.36734693877551

7937728,4,B00005BJWE,"Silly but generally entertaining disaster movie has the bratty 12-year-old daughter of a Bill Gates style tech billionaire named Raymond Stone (Joe Mantegna, who always seems to do solid work whether the material merits it or not) being transported home on a private jet after being kicked out of the latest in an apparently long string of expensive boarding schools.  After an accident in which her plane is struck by lightning everybody onboard is rendered unconscious including the pilot and copilot.  Well, almost everybody.  12-year-old Nicole Stone (Elisha Cuthbert) is the only person unaffected by the accident.  It turns out being bratty has its upsides--she was doing a Darth Vader impression with an oxygen mask at the time of the accident so wakes up quickly and was lucky to escape any kind of injury.  Oh yeah, the lighting also blew a person-sized hole in the cabin of the plane which either creates a lot of suction in the passenger cabin or virtually none depending on the needs of each individual scene.

Beyond the goofy hole in the cabin that seemingly becomes dangerous or harmless at various points in the movie without explanation, there's also the fact that planes are actually made to withstand direct hits by lightning and in real life are basically lightning rods when flying through storms.  There's no way a lightning strike could inflict the kind of damage it does in the film unless there was something seriously wrong with the way the plane was engineered--but Air Speed clearly isn't meant to be a realistic movie so that probably won't bother the target audience much unless it happens to give them an unjustified fear of flying through storms.

I wasn't aware that Elisha Cuthbert (Calamity Kim on 24) was a child actress.  While she's no great shakes as an actress here or as an adult she is more than adequate for her part--making for a likably plucky heroine who learns to not be so selfish and also to not doubt her own inner strength and ability.

Air Speed is clearly intended as a family film more than as a thriller for adults.  It's extremely kid-friendly and will likely please them since a 12-year-old is the film's hero--plus there's a corny but touching father/daughter scene via cell phone when things look fairly bleak--but parents will likely have a pretty good time as well.  Air Speed is shameless, manipulative, corny and not in the least bit believable--but it also manages more thrills than you would expect from a movie with such a goofy premise.  I wish Amazon allowed half star ratings because Air Speed falls between three and four stars so squarely I had trouble deciding which of the two ratings to give it.  Air Speed is recommended more as a kid or a family film but I have neither and ultimately had a pretty enjoyable time anyway.",1499126400,,2796,4.810020876826722
