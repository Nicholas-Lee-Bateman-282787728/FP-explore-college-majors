3597866,5,B001G7Q1PE,Great mindless comic escapism that looks and sounds great in Blu-Ray (and that's just the two FF movies).  Plus...the added benefit of giving Daredevil a packaging that may bring it to a larger audience than it got at the outset...never understood why people didn't like this movie...Colin Farrell is worth the price of admission alone.,1248739200,,336,5.109090909090909
3597867,4,B001G7Q1PE,"...but if you bought this you'd then own both Fantastic 4 movies and Daredevil.

Kidding aside, if you're a Marvel movie collector or just looking for some brainless action to kickstart your summer in HD, here's a good chance to do so at a pretty decent price. If you're an extras nut, you'd be better served buying these separately or waiting for a more in-depth collection. I'm sure Marvel is waiting to put together a ""Mega Pack"" but when, I have no clue, and I'm betting that premium will be pretty high unlike the nice price point here.",1247788800,,541,4.520408163265306
3597868,5,B001G7Q1PE,"This set is really interesting,specially at this price. I also bought a trilogy of spidy,but one gets pretty bored of it quite fast and this set is just a watch again and again. Hope other cool sets quite similar will be produced in the future.i've heard that ""Captain America"" is in stage of finalisation. Can't wait to see what marvel comes up with!!!!!",1246752000,,355,4.650793650793651
3597869,3,B001G7Q1PE,"The Bluray transfer of these movies are great, and its very hard to complain for the price, but the original Fantastic 4 movie is missing many of the extras included with the old DVD version and the Daredevil disc has the director's cut, but is missing the theaterical version and many of the extras from the old DVD version. Only the Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer disc offers comparable extras equivalent to the old DVD issue. If you don't care about extras or added content, and like comic book movies (even ones that aren't the greatest), this set is a great deal.

If you were looking to replace your old DVD versions with comparable extras and HD quality, you may want to hold off on getting this in hopes that a superior version will one day be released on blu-ray.",1245110400,53,780,4.492957746478873
3597870,1,B001G7Q1PE,"The Fantastic Four movies were absolutely terrible.  Daredevil wasn't exactly a gem either, but at least it was watchable.  My recommendation would be to just pick up the Daredevil movie (if you're really that interested in it) and not waste money on the other two.",1244592000,2,265,4.866666666666666
3597871,4,B001G7Q1PE,"I got these some time ago and never thought to write a review. I paid more, but am happy with my purchase. The films are good, my least favorite was Daredevil, inspite of it being a ""Director's Cut"". I guess they needed to make it sound better? I do like Fantastic Four, though Rise of the Silver Surfer was a bit weak, and kind of brainless....but then, I wasn't expecting much, so I was not really disappointed.  The graphics here are just great, as with most Blu-Rays. For $30 you get 3 Blu-Rays, and depending on your preferences, you can consider, as I did, that you are buying two at $15 each, and then getting Daredevil free. :-) However you look at it, it's a good deal for two and half movies. My son also enjoyed Fantastic Four (both). These are all kind of silly. Do not expect Batman types of plots/story line. You are not getting that here. If you want some fun, and a good price, this might be to your liking.",1244592000,,923,4.304597701149425
3597872,5,B001G7Q1PE,"I am a big fan of the Fantastic 4 movies. They are a good entertaining time. They are no Batman begins or The Dark Knight. But they get the tone of the comics and the animates series. They look Great on Blu ray. I got them for X-mas 2008. I also prefer the directors cut of Dare Devil. Much better better version then the theatrical version. It includes a subplot that was deleted from the theatrical release and shortens the Electra plot line.

These Blu rays are $29.99 if purchased separate, so even at $49.99 that makes them around 16.50 a movie. I got them after thanksgiving for $39.99, so watch they may go on sale again for that price.",1230163200,5,643,4.358333333333333

3597876,2,B001G7Q1PE,"Although Rise of the Silver Surfer and Daredevil have FRENCH AUDIO, Fantastic 4 doesn't!
On the covers of the 3-Pack box everything is translated English-French...Even the title of the movie.

But once you sit down with your kids to enjoy the movie,, you cannot believe that French is not available
on the Audio Menu .... What a disappointment.

Fool me once.... will be extra careful with Amazon.com descriptions now.",1387324800,,418,5.043478260869565
3597877,5,B001G7Q1PE,great movie and even better as a gift. played well and was brand new.  great if you are into blu rays,1386201600,,101,3.8095238095238093

3597879,2,B001G7Q1PE,"In the description of the article says that the movies are in English, French and Spanish and subtitles in the same languages but to receive four fantastic the movie is in English and French and subtitles in the same languages, which is disappointing because I am speaking Hispanic and so the search for at least subtitled in Spanish",1378425600,,333,4.758620689655173
3597880,1,B001G7Q1PE,"Amazon has been recommending this to me for a month.

These movies are terrible. And not a little terrible, but supremely terrible. There's really no amount of savings that would ever cause me to add these to my movie collection, and I'll be honest: With a movie collection well past 1,200 movies, there's some pretty mediocre stuff in my collection already. But these three films take the cake.

Save your money, and buy a movie you'll actually enjoy. Three movies at a discount price isn't really a discount if they're horrible films.",1375488000,2,536,4.815217391304348
3597881,5,B001G7Q1PE,He watched it all over the holiday break and he really appreciated this gift from me. I would assume he will re-watch all of three movies again.,1358985600,,144,4.37037037037037
3597882,5,B001G7Q1PE,"If only there are more sets of such variety movies. 3 movies for a reasonable price, really worth getting it!",1358121600,,109,4.5
3597883,5,B001G7Q1PE,I bought this set mostly to see Daredevil. I'd seen it before and thought it was worth owning. Alot of people didn't like the casting and script in all that but I think it was enough in line with the comic book and the script was pretty good as well. The two Fantastic Four movies both had great special effects and decent scripts and casting was actually pretty good as well.,1356566400,,376,4.309859154929577
3597884,5,B001G7Q1PE,I highly recommend purchasing this Marvel Blue-ray three pack. Blue-ray quality is great and the price is right. All three movies are Marvel at it's best!,1339718400,,154,4.961538461538462
3597885,5,B001G7Q1PE,"This Marvel pack is a great way to start your BLU-RAY collection if you are starting one. Daredevil was a good movie, I honestly don't see how people thought it wasn't good. If you appreciate Marvel Comics Daredevil is great. Both Fantastic 4's were great! Enough about the movies, lets talk about the product itself. It is exactly how its described...BRAND NEW! Everything was sealed and the packaging wasn't too bulky. I didn't have to go to the Post Office to pick it up; It fit right in the mailbox and was bubbled wrapped. Awesome seller, awesome product!",1311638400,,560,4.724489795918367
3597886,4,B001G7Q1PE,"OK, these are popcorn movies. So, just have to make that point clear. For its price, this is a great value. The movies look and sound great on blu-ray. Fantastic Four might not be the best superhero movie, but it's entertaining. Especially when you just want to turn off your brain and watch the special effects.

Daredevil, on the other hand, is quite a good movie. Definitely the best in the collection.",1301270400,5,405,4.625

Great Collection for Comic Fans who were Raised Reading these comics!!!!

3597890,5,B001G7Q1PE,"I collect comic book movies. I'm a fan of both Marvel and DC comics (huge Superman fan), overall the movies are ok. I rated 5 stars, because I got an awesome deal on these blu-rays. I did enjoy watching the Fantastic Four movies, and Daredevil wasn't too bad either. My favorite comic book movies are Dark Knight, and Iron Man. If you are collecting blu-ray/comic book movies, then this is a great deal.",1263513600,,403,4.534246575342466

3597892,5,B001G7Q1PE,"One thing is for certain, if you've never seen the Daredevil Director's Cut you're missing out on a great film. (One that's remarkably better than its theatrical release) I'm glad they didn't include a copy of the initial release on Blu-Ray. That film should be ignored. Honestly, the DD DC is one of the best comic based films regarding any origin. It's better than Batman Begins, Spider-Man and Superman. The FF films are fun and look great in HD on Blu-Ray. Too bad there wasn't more story to go along with the popcorn fun. Overall, the price is right and every Blu-Ray collection should have these movies.",1260316800,12,609,4.700934579439252

Fantastic Four 1 - 3.5 stars
Fantastic Four 2 - 2.5 stars
Daredevil Director's Cut 3.5 stars

By the way, the ""Daredevil Directors Cut"" turned a mediocre theatrical release into a quite decent movie, complete with subplots that were removed from the theatrical release.  It still suffers from very weak special effects, but at least you understand Murdock's motivations way more in this version.",1424217600,,447,4.933333333333334
