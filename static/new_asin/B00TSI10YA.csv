7022328,2,B00TSI10YA,"Season 4 just became too bizarre in the story telling. In addition, I was really annoyed with the ""my family first and screw everyone else"" attitude of Noah Wyle and his entire family. In fact, I became so dis-enchanted with the series that I sold it even BEFORE viewing the final season five.",1468972800,,293,4.547169811320755

7022331,5,B00TSI10YA,"Despite the alien invasion theme, Falling Skies has been a good family show.  There is certainly violence -- as one would expect -- and tension between the characters.  But this has been a good series.  Having now seen the fifth season, I need to temper this review.  The first four seasons were excellent.  The last season did not live up to the promise of the first four.  So, if you are trying to decide if you want to purchase this series, keep that in mind.",1464998400,,462,4.376470588235295

7022351,5,B00TSI10YA,"I don't watch this because I'm particularly into Alien Invasion movies. The attraction is Noah Wile and the actors who play his three boys: Drew Roy, Connor Jessup, and Maxim Knight. The latter has literally grown up on set and has now entered his teenage years. Despite the challenges they face this is a family that exchanges hugs and truly appears to care for one another. The two older brothers even engage in fisticuffs when they both become attracted to the same girl.

Yes there is plenty of action and the players wonder around with assault rifles at their backs, people die, and things explode. There is even a certain ick factor, but it is the interpersonal relationships that drive the plot lines.",1450828800,,708,4.7560975609756095

7022355,4,B00TSI10YA,"I love this series, but Season 4 has disappointed me a little. The story has somehow turned into a family drama. Nothing wrong with family dramas, but Falling Skies is (supposed to be) an SF series. Not that there is no room for family drama in an SF, but the whole season???
But, good acting, rich conversation, multi-faced characters, dramatic directing,... all these have made the season interesting!",1448409600,,403,4.9411764705882355

7022371,3,B00TSI10YA,"[Minor season three spoiler alert] Season four rejoins the ever more depleted ranks of the second Mass on their journey back to Charleston after Cochise helps them escape the Volms planned deportation to a safe zone. All seems sweetness and light until the dastardly Espheni strike, just for a change. More plot detail would definitely constitute a spoiler but suffice the say the body count mounts, stuff blows up and they still haven't run out of shampoo.

What they do seem to have run out of, however, is the superb writing and clever plotting that characterised earlier seasons. The plot is very linear, the central narrative is plain daft and gets more daft as the season progresses, there are a couple of cringingly contrived & lazy plot devices, the first two episodes take place almost entirely in the dark, previously well developed characters become oddly inconsistent monolithic stereotypes and there is a lot more general silliness. It is not all bad though; the Alexis story is a satisfying break from Tom Masons megalomania & the Mason family soap and Pope (Major Davis from Stargate SG1  whod have thought it!) continues to delight with his anarchic honour.

After the incredible originality, intelligence and pace of the last season, season four is a bit of a disappointment; perhaps it is a good thing that season five is the last one. There are hints of great things to come  an alien threat worse than the Espheni and the somewhat obvious season finale adds weight to that hint  lets just hope that the entire writing and production teams pull their fingers out and give a ripping final instalment.",1442707200,2,1618,4.890510948905109

Otherwise the ridiculous plots, endless sentimentality and cliches will make you want to vomit. Seriously, the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever heard in a series, especially considering the people involved in producing it, you would think they could afford to pay for good writers. The dialogue is almost entirely cliches with very little originality present. Why did I watch it then? Simple. I had nothing else to watch at the time and I like to finish things I start, although I may draw the line after Season 4 of this series.",1440892800,4,633,4.81651376146789

7022405,4,B00TSI10YA,"The 2nd Mass has been through a lot.  Tom Mason and his family have to deal with the fact that Alexis the daughter of Tom and Ann has grown and it has something to do with whatever Karen under the control of the Esphin.  Meanwhile as they see the sight of Charleston they are attacked and many are killed and seprated by a strange new grid of the Esphin making.
  Tom, Weaver, Pope and his oldest son Hal find themselves in  what is referred to as a ghetto where food and other items are scarce and under the watchful eye a Epshin overlord.  They must figure a way out before they become the next unwilling subjects in an experiment that could see the end of not only them, but the human race.  As that is happening Alexsis has grown into a woman with white hair and shows dangerous powers not normal to human life.  And somehow has created a safe haven for those that wish to stop fighting and be ;left alone in peace.  In this strange new utopia Maggie has found her way as has Ben Tom's middle son along  with Lourdas who unlike the others have vaulted Alexis to a god.
  Matt meanwhile has been taken to a reeducation camp.  A place where human children of varying ages are being told that the Esphin were here to help them and to make things better.  However Matt has other ideas and needs to get away before it is too late.
  Ann is taking the last of the 2nd Mass and anyone else who can still fight to try and find Alexsis and the others. Driven by anger and hurt that her family has been separated she has nothing left but her anger to keep her going.
  As all of the characters try to face the bleak future in which they could very well loose everything they still have one friend  still fighting Cochise and his scouting party as the Volm has left the Earth to fight their hated foes on another front far off in space.  Even he begins to think that it might be the end of the human race.",1438300800,,1898,4.19060773480663

(the only let-down was the fate of Weaver's daughter - too abrupt)
Noah Wylie is one of my favorite actors.  He is just so natural and charismatic. And with ER and now Falling Skies on his resume, Wylie maybe ready to enter the realm of genuine TV superstars (like Tom Selleck or William Shatner).
Back to the show, highlights include: 1) Pope being Pope,and giving everyone attitude 2) Lourdes pays for being too much of a zealot 3) Tom doing a knockout-hilarious JFK impression 4) a love/lust triangle develops 5) who is that supergirl caught between two families?

7022457,4,B00TSI10YA,"""Falling Skies: season 4""(2014) is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi show which sees the earth attacked by aliens. A major focus all the way through this series is the bonds of family despite the disagreements and conflicts, with the community being a larger manifestation of the idea of family. It is the tug-a-war between the feelings of the characters and their relationships with other family members or friends that keeps this series interesting, with the aliens sometimes merely being a backdrop for all of these interactions. As many of the characters become infected with alien genes, or are hybrid human/alien offspring (Lexi), what, or who is alien, becomes murkier and murkier. The fourth season is probably the best so far with the introduction of Scarlett Byrne as an alien/human hybrid who epitomizes the inner conflicts between self and the two species. Trust is a major theme of the show with this dwindling group of humans who look to be on the verge of extinction. The show becomes more interesting when various realities are exploited, where dreams of altered states of reality blind the character's sense of reality. When all of these aspects are exploited effectively this series is at its most interesting with the various dynamics and tensions at play.

This set has a number of featurettes, including one about the character Tom Mason, episodic prequels, character interviews, and a San Diego comic con panel discussion. The image quality of the blu-ray is excellent and highly detailed with excellent contrast.",1434844800,10,1527,5.157258064516129

My problem is me. I'm just getting tired of the dark lighting and scruffy bearded men in most shows today.
I realize this is alien disaster,  but really, they could look like they take a bath and shave ONCE IN A WHILE!
If all women just love the scruffy bearded man, and I don't think they do,  then that is pathetic!

7022474,4,B00TSI10YA,"This season was the darkest in the history of the show.  Last season ended with a lot of unknowns especially regarding Tom and Anne's daughter Lexi, but also with hope.  That finally the humans have a fighting chance against the enemy.  Without giving away spoilers the 1st part of the first episode features an all out attack on the 2nd Mass, that leaves them broken and scattered apart and some in very bad positions.

The first half of the season is all about reuniting, and dealing with the issues and traumas of what occurred during their separation.  The most changed by the events in ep 1 are Anne and Matt.  We see a side of the good doctor that I didn't know existed.  She goes from being the kind healer and supportive matriarch  standing behind Tom, to a desperate mother trying to find her child, and leading a small group of survivors with authority of a war general.  She went from a woman who was afraid to even hold a gun, to fashioning weapons from spare parts, standing sentry for the group, and taking on the enemy with guns blazing.  Matt on the other hand grew up the hard way this year.  Ep 1 finds him completely separated from his family for the first time, and in great danger from the aliens known as the Esphini.  He begins to set himself apart as a future leader, but learns adult life lessons the hard way.  One of the saddest things of this season was seeing his child like exuberance, and sweet innocence die.  The person he has become is stronger but the cost was very high.

My only real issue with the season was how dark t became and out of seemingly nowhere.  There was no build up, just an instant change, and it was a little startling.  The alien overlords get more screen time this season and we learn a little about how they tick, what is their end game and a glimpse into why they are doing this.  Some of their scenes I could have done without.

Overall great season with few flaws, and I can't wait for season 5 which TBS has confirmed will be the last.",1433635200,3,1996,4.360433604336043
