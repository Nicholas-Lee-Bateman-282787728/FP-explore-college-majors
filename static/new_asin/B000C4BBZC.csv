I got it and I hated it, SInce when did become the bowow omarion tour, Its called scream tour, there the only people on it! You'd think that Everyone on the tour would be on, but no! no B5, Pretty ricky or Bobby V. Unless u want to see bowow cocky self and omarion, buy it.",1134864000,4,412,3.9759036144578315
2452811,4,B000C4BBZC,"I thought it was off the hook, especially when they came to Memphis!  The only reason why it lost a star cause, I wish they could have added Pretty Ricky, Bobby V., Marques to the project cause they were just as important to the tour.  So if you didn't go see this in person then you should get it, but it was better in person, lol.",1134777600,,332,4.015151515151516

2452813,5,B000C4BBZC,"can't wait till comes out.

the only reason i'm getting this is because B5 ,bobby valentino &  PRETTY ricky were part of it . so i'm basically getting this for those three performances.!<3 i love b5 & pretty ricky to pieces.and i'm not a groupie but yea can't wait till this comes out.i used to be a omari & bow wow fan..but their attitude is kinda ehhhh..no offense to the fans.but i'm not hating since i'm also getting this support them.",1132790400,,439,4.407407407407407
2452814,5,B000C4BBZC,"I went to the Washington D.C. concert and it was hyped. All the performers had the crowd pumped. I was crazy. There wasn't one dull moment in the show. It was really great. I hope all my Bow Wow, Omarion, B5, Bobby V, Marques Houston, and Pretty Ricky fan will make this Dvd #1 and Roll bounce #1 too.",1132531200,2,301,4.11864406779661
8095662,5,B000C4BBZC,"I've been looking for this for the longest, and everytime I watch it with my little sister it sends us right back into screaming fans.",1479340800,,134,4.4
8095663,1,B000C4BBZC,"Im a producer and musician, so i love live concerts with live bands. it really turns me off when i see a concert and the artist is singing to a back track with no band. i gave this to my daughters, i just couldn't take it. its not like a mint condition, beyonce, usher, or mary j Blige concert when u know the artist and musicians are going to blow you away.",1282089600,,358,3.986111111111111
8095664,5,B000C4BBZC,I loved this DVD. Just wish it was the entire concert including the other artists. It's nice to see wholesome entertainment among urban artists,1181260800,,143,5.0
8095665,4,B000C4BBZC,"Bow Wow and O did they thing on the tour and its all about them. If you're a fan of B2k,Omarion brings back old songs from b2k and Bow does songs of his adolesence along with their new hits. Like I said,they both seemed to dance,sing and rap their hearts out so if you like O and Bow get it. Dont expect to see Bobby V,Pretty Ricky or anyone else. Its just the two headliners portion of the show you are paying for.

Extras In The DVD...........

Three of Tommy's Clowns from the movie ""Rize"" do appear in the dvd dancing.

-Behind of the scenes of the Scream Tour with Bow and O are also on the dvd.

-Let Me Hold You video also appears on dvd with different versions focusing on Bow and O.

Like I said it was cool and I like  and reccomend it.",1170460800,,746,4.040816326530612

8095667,5,B000C4BBZC,"From start to finish this dvd was exiting, sexy and brillant dancing.  They really pulled the audience together.  It was truly the best of both worlds.  I would have liked to see more of Marcus Huston and Bobby Valentine.  Heart throbs indeed.",1138579200,2,243,4.714285714285714
8095668,3,B000C4BBZC,"THIS ISN'T JOSEPH. I AM HIS OLDEST DAUGHTER.

I am soooo MAD right now. This is just an Omarion/Bow Wow show. And I admit they were good (especially Khelo Thomas), but where the heck are B5 and Pretty Ricky? NO WHERE THAT'S WHERE!!!! THEY SHOULD HAVE FILMED THE D.C. CONCERT!!!

Unless you like Bow Wow and Omarion, DON'T BUY THIS!!!",1135468800,8,333,4.533333333333333
8095669,5,B000C4BBZC,"This DVD was off the hook. I went to the scream IV tour when they came to detroit michigan and it was off the chain. This dvd is great but i wish that they put pretty ricky on the dvd because they were straight up sexy. They was hiprolling,poping and humping on the groud. It was so sexy-ya feelz me!!!. Overall the dvd was great because my man OMARION was on it and he looked good!!!. Bow wow did his thang too! I recommend this dvd to anyone that hasn't been to none of their concerts so that they can see how they get down!! LOL",1135382400,,531,4.018867924528302
8095670,4,B000C4BBZC,"Speaking for the guys, this was a great tour, but they should have put the whole tour on DVD. The spot light was on my boy Bow wow and Omarion. Good tour though.",1135123200,,161,3.909090909090909
8095671,3,B000C4BBZC,"okkkk i liked it, but i agree they should've done the WHOLE thing, the BEST part was preetty ricky, i mean isn't it their first tour, they were so good, b5 wasn't in L.a so i didn't get to see them , but they should've atleast added the Marquez Houston part of the show, specially when he sang his NAKed song!. . but this is a gOOD DVD if your into O n weezy!! like me. .i guess. . it just didn't satisgy me and met my expectatuions!!",1135036800,,434,3.9431818181818183
