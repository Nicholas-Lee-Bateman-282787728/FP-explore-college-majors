8025005,1,B00029YLYU,"The bad editing and hastily put together format on this video had me thinking for a moment it should have been titled. ""How to shoot a Glock using a 1911 pistol"" by Ed Wood. Yes the movies is that bad it's almost good. I have no doubt Mr. Wilson knows what he's doing, but he seems very shy and self effacing in front of the camera: not a good thing for an instructional video. I purchased the firearm video for more information on how to shoot the glock (why is he using a 1911?). I wanted to know more about 'grip' and 'recoil control'. Mr. Wilson has very unusual (at least to me) thumb positioning with his glock. Why are his thumbs positioned like that? we'll never know. The camera operator does zoom into his fist (for all of two seconds) and then zooms out again, (the camera work is unsteady at times, causing me to believe he rented the first alcohol sodden vagrant he could find sleeping in the park to do the camera work for him. When we do finally get to the Glock (for cleaning purposes) he spends more timing trying to hawk product that he came up with than actually spent on the cleaning. Very disappointing. I feel I've spent over twenty bucks for a Bill Wilson commercial.",1296259200,2,1190,4.364864864864865
8025006,2,B00029YLYU,Not much in this video. They did it mostly to advertise their own lubricating oil. Better info in Building The Ultimate Glock by Lenny Magill.,1265500800,3,142,4.72
8025007,4,B00029YLYU,"Interesting video for the real beginner like me.
Good but short explanation of basic skills (stance, grip, sights,...).
I would recommend this video to the real beginner, it's a good way to start and to get into the ""mode"" of shooting with a Glock.",1265500800,,248,4.659090909090909
8025008,1,B00029YLYU,Very disapointed in the purchase.  When reading what the DVD was SUPPOSE to cover I thought I was getting a DVD for more accurate shooting and helpful tips but it turned out to be an informercial on his products.  I was looking for a DVD to help me learn to shoot better and tips for better accuracy and did not get either.  Do not buy! Was a waste of money!,1236211200,6,358,4.085714285714285
8025009,3,B00029YLYU,If you want to know how to shoot and grip you have to buy it....,1202428800,2,64,3.3333333333333335
8025010,1,B00029YLYU,"There is no zero stars. That's the only reason for one star. Bill Wilson of Wilson Combat goes through the motions on this DVD about Glocks. At least that is what you think you are getting. Only a third of the video is directed towards the gun. The beginning is about basic shooting skills. Next is cleaning the gun, but it only covers basic field cleaning. Next he pitches his own cleaners oils and lubes. That's right I paid a lot for things that either come with the owners manual of the gun, by watching people shoot at the range, or watching late night infomercials. Also, I know he is a wonderful craftsman, but he is as boring as a librarian. Do not buy this video. It is horrible.",1114560000,45,688,4.341085271317829
