4154208,2,B003M05KUA,"this film had so much potential. and for the first 30 minutes, the films was intriguing. then it just got surreal and stupid. it is so sad, bc the colors were rich and the cinametography good - yet the storyline was weak and dysfunctional, and the characters shallow.  Also, the blonde woman is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen.  She is what breaks the film. Pity.",1323993600,8,373,4.470588235294118
4154209,1,B003M05KUA,"The theme is basically, girls only use other girls to learn how to please boys, for ""practice"", and/or to keep hymens intact for future husbands.  The girls that fall in love with other girls only do so because they are crazy and want to be boys.  In the end, boy gets girl and all is right again.... this movie sucked.  Maybe you will like the story, but being a lesbian, it just made me sad.",1321315200,17,393,4.213333333333333
4154210,3,B003M05KUA,"This movie does remind me of Summer Lovers (1982), I liked the old one form the '82 movie better than this Summer Lover. Summer Lover gives me a little creep. Sappo is insane, she was fine all along before she arrives to Greek Isle of Lesbos. I kinda think Helene ruined Sappo's mind turned into insane twist and obsession.  I wish Sappo's husband should have taken Sappo and himself back to where they are from. None of this would have get worse.",1314748800,2,447,4.451219512195122
4154211,3,B003M05KUA,"Even though the whole thing was crazy it was somthing i really enjoyed. sappho was awesome and i liked how crazy and true to herself she was, and helen was just a lying bitch that played with all the characters feelings and the husband well he was a pussy and i cant believe the ending. idk i liked the movie just because sappho was in it and she made it fun and bitter sweet.",1311465600,3,376,4.094594594594595
4154212,1,B003M05KUA,"Acting was bad.
Plot was TOTALLY unbelievable.
The female lead was obviously crazy which lead to an insane plot line.
Movie had a weird overly dramatic / unbelievable ending.

4154213,4,B003M05KUA,It's a lot more interesting than the cover shows. The landscaping is great and the theme interesting with some nicely done sex scenes.,1308182400,4,134,4.869565217391305
4154214,2,B003M05KUA,"i rented it because it sounded ok and it was on my recomendations. I don't like the characters. The only one I liked was her husband because I found the wife to be a bossy flake, and as soon as I learend who the other chick was I stopped watching it because shes weird too.

Idk maybe I'm weird but I cant watch a movie where the characters are already annoyign me in 20 minutes. Pluss it takes place in the 20's so its hard to relate to.",1306713600,3,438,3.977272727272727
4154215,2,B003M05KUA,"..the sex scenes this movie was played so heavily upon in the marketing to stores. But even then, the editing and really cheesy music ruined the few sultry scenes.

The story follows almost identically to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hemingway-s-Garden-of-Eden/dp/B004HGCNBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hemingway's Garden of Eden</a>, right down to the change in hair color and forced performances. The two ladies are very attractive and decently perform the outdoor love scenes, but the main story has been played out so many times with the newlywed couple throwing some flair their way by adding a third party while living in a beautiful locale (Lesbos shoreline) - but this one fell short in providing a talented re-telling. The inevitable drama unfolds and that ending leaves you with a wasted-time feeling.

The filming style and editing are quite poor, the sound was obviously dubbed in later and the musical score was distracting and out of place. The scenery is gorgeous and deserves a high definition treatment, but Phase 4 does not do Blu. Normally I would not focus on the skin angle, but many of my lesbian customers have asked about this title in anticipation, and that really seems to be the only positive point of the film (as the actresses' shared scenes are tasteful, graphic and sensual - but even then the filmmakers tried splicing in nature footage and failed). The cover art front and back tried to sell this title on the main love scene, but they obviously had to paint over certain body parts and the result is even cheesier than the film.

No special features, the 5.1 is used intermittently and the picture quality is below average to sometimes decent. Region coded 1.",1302220800,17,1738,5.244604316546763
4154216,3,B003M05KUA,"This film was originally released as ""Sappho"", in 2008. The delay of release in the US should tell you something about the quality of the film - it's only okay.

With the title ""Sappho"" you know where this film is going. In case you don't Sappho was an Ancient Greek woman who is supposed to be the first celibrated lesbian. In fact she was from the island of Lesbos and her island's name gave us the term lesbian.

Set in the 1920s, Avalon Barrie plays Sappho who is recently married to Phil (Todd Soley). They arrive on a Greek island. Soon Sappho gets bored with how her hubby makes love and she is seduced by Helene (Lyudmila Shiryaeva) who plays the daughter of a Russian historian.

The woman are beautiful. The plot is flimsy and predictable.",1297900800,14,749,4.492647058823529

4154218,2,B003M05KUA,"The actresses are both gorgeous, no doubt about that.  I did like the scenery in the film.  Sadly though, several things disappointed me:  the quality of the acting, the plot, and the usual negative portrayal of a lesbian as crazy and tragic.  I agree with a lot of the previous reviews on this site.  The acting felt stilted and was painful to watch most of the time.  It bothered me that the Helen character was a pseudo lesbian who was only interested in Sappho until she met her (Sappho's) husband, then used her to get him.  The plot was unrealistic and the ending was awful!  Helen and Sappho's husband (can't even remember his name, haha) showed no apparent sadness or remorse over Sappho's tragic demise.  They had the nerve to start a relationship on the boat headed home with Sappho's body on ice down below.  They couldn't even wait until she was buried!  And like I said before, Sappho was painted as a crazy lesbian - which is how lesbians are often characterized as in films.  It feels like this was a somewhat homophobic film made for the sake of pleasing men in general and not for women.  You can tell that this film was directed by a man who is clueless about women and also sexist.  Too bad because as one of the reviewers said, this film had a lot of potential.",1427932800,2,1281,4.44206008583691
4154219,2,B003M05KUA,"The wild cinematography and striking visuals are quite breathtaking, and would be well suited to a movie that wasn't supposed to be a tragic romance. The director has a great eye for eye candy, he just has no idea how to use it to establish a mood.

Aside from that, what's the old saw about when you can't say anything nice? Do yourself a favor and mute the volume; despite the good but misused music, it's worth it to not have to hear anyone speak. Just don't expect any sense or sexiness, with or without sound.",1424476800,,514,4.354166666666667

4154222,1,B003M05KUA,This movie was very boring and didn't make any sense. I know it didn't cost much to make this film. The storyline was so stupid sick and twisted and you won't understand it.,1399420800,,173,4.2727272727272725

4154224,1,B003M05KUA,"This movie was awesomely awful.  The acting was very stilted, as was the dialogue (probably because it seems like it was dubbed in later?). That combined with a terrible plot (which could have been promising if not for the anti-homosexuality message and the ridiculousness) made for a movie that is really difficult to sit through. There are a lot of brief straight sex scenes in this movie and a couple of quick lesbian sex scenes, none of which are actually very sensual. The script seems like it was written by some kids for a Greek literature class, and I know I could have acted better than the female lead, who seemed to be rattling off her lines without any sense of character. The movie is set in the 1920s, but the writers of the script thought that they had to literally say it for you to understand it (I guess they think that the viewers are unintelligent). So the main actor stated ""it's 1926,"" early in the film, which is ridiculous.  The lead also says something about being from Virginia, and has a pseudo-Southern accent in the first 20 minutes, but somewhere along the way, the accent is dropped, and later in the film, the characters talk about New York City, so it sounds like they are a little confused about their own origins. SPOILER ALERT: The seductress who comes along and screws things up preys upon Sappho to get closer to her man, apparently, and the results are ultimately disastrous for the wife..but not for the husband and the new lover! This movie is tragic, not just because of the ending, but because of a weak, high-school project-type plot and dialogue and really, genuinely bad acting. The setting had some promise, but everything falls apart rather quickly, especially when you realize that there's just no talent behind the whole film and the main message you get from the movie is that homosexuality leads to disaster.  Not at all realistic, but not creative enough to be surreal, either.  Just sad.  Quite the little piece of softcore anti-LGBT propaganda, though I would suspect that porn stars are more believable actors than the ones in this film!",1359504000,2,2093,4.723287671232876
4154225,3,B003M05KUA,"While ""Summer Lover"" is by no means a profound motion picture, I found it to be intriguing for several reasons: First, it advocates a free, sensual pagan lifestyle which is fascinating to consider and explore; and second, it challenges (even mocks) Christian beliefs which condemn free love and a diversity of human sexual expression. Yes, it's all rather badly acted, but there are moments and some good lines of script. The production values are strong and the geography is expertly used to illustrate the theme. The two women performers--who play bisexual lovers--are very attractive (the 'eye candy' aspect of this movie is worth men taking a peek).It is an uninhibited erotic fantasy you might like to share and discuss with a lover--if you dare to open this Pandora's Box!",1351641600,,778,5.038759689922481
4154226,2,B003M05KUA,"Wow, what a colossal waste of time and money this was. Not sexy enough to be erotica, and not inspired enough to be artistic, this was one of the  most disappointing movies that I've ever purchased. If you stumbled onto this (as I did) while seeking soft-core pornography or adult-themed art, don't believe reviews that rate ""Summer Lover"" high in either category. In fact the first adjective that I can think of to describe it is ""dull.""

Any movie stamped ""unrated"" across its cover very clearly has been produced to appeal to those who watch erotica, but this thing gets so bogged down in its own pretentiousness that it takes half an hour before it gets to even a brief flash of nudity. And I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that the sex scenes are this movies only redeemable quality--nay, even those are no exception, for they show far too little and get by on rambunctiousness. The bedroom scenes in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" were sexier. And what was up with the aerial photography? I just got the feeling when watching this that the director thinks that his %$^@ doesn't stink.

If there is an appealing part of this movie, it would have to be the scenery--which is, actually, quite stunning.",1330732800,8,1215,4.694835680751174

8399958,1,B003M05KUA,"Summer Lover is essentially a porn movie, but with a slightly higher budget. It seems to be a remake of an earlier film with a similar title, Summer Lovers. The plot is set on the island of Lesbos in Greece, and one of the characters is nicknamed Sappho. The references are ber-obvious. The non-erotic acting is extremely bad, as behooves a porn flick, but sure, there's a lot of sex. The ending is a pseudo-tragedy  la Classical Greece. The whole thing is frankly embarrassing, but I suppose the Greek surroundings may be good for the local tourist industry",1526947200,,558,4.6938775510204085
