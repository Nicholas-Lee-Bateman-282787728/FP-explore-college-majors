2663990,5,B000IV9CDM,"I was flabbergasted to see that this set included one of the greatest Scifi films of all time: THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN!! All these films are entertaining, including the MOLE PEOPLE (which starred the actor who played Beaver Cleaver's father) and the others. However, the clincher is THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, one of the most profound and powerful scifi films ever made (it does NOT have a happy ending, however profound it may be in the ""cosmic sense""). Just go out and buy this one. Its worth every penny!!!",1165190400,12,517,4.820224719101123
2663991,4,B000IV9CDM,"These are the movies I watched as a kid, and I'll probably trundle over to Best Buy (ugh!) to pick up this set, but I have to wonder why they chose these particular movies, when at least two of them are trash and could have been replaced with much better selections.  Incredible Shrinking Man is a classic, and Tarantula is pretty decent for its genre and era. I've never seen Monolith Monsters, and this new set will give me the chance to do that. So far, so good. But Monster on the Campus and Mole People are just crap, no matter how you try to pretend otherwise. Why didn't they include It Came From Outer Space and This Island Earth instead of those two clunkers?  If they'd done so, this really WOULD be The Classic Ultimate Sci-Fi Collection ... or at least The Universal-International  Ultimate Sci-Fi Collection. (Most of the REAL classics from this era were released by other studios.)  As it stands, I had to stretch to give this four stars.",1162339200,5,952,4.517441860465116
2663992,4,B000IV9CDM,"For whatever reason, the only place to purchase this is at Best Buy, which must have made a deal with Universal to be the exclusive seller. Private Amazon sellers are apparently trying to cash in on this fact by buying these collections from Best Buy and then selling them for ten bucks or more than the sale price on Amazon.

With that said, five of Universal's science fiction classics are finally available on DVD. The transfers to DVD are outstanding. These films never looked better. All of the films are full screen with the exception of ""The Incredible Shrinking Man,"" which is in anamorphic widescreen 16x9 format. It looks great when played in a progressive scan DVD player on a HD television. The other films look great, too, only they're in full screen format. It's hard to say which of these films I like better. For anyone who grew up in the 1970s, these films will bring back a lot of memories.

The reason for not giving the collection five stars is because Universal didn't go through the trouble of adding chapter selections. One could skip through scenes on each film, but there's no actual chapter selection section. The only extras are trailers for each film.",1162339200,12,1179,4.718446601941747

2663994,5,B000IV9CDM,"Had I not been rummaging through obscure Amazon.com DVD releases I would have never known about this set unless I stumbled upon it in Best Buy one day. That is if it was still in stock.  Why Universal made this a ""Best Buy Exclusive only"" I don't know. The other reviews were extremely helpful in pointing that out. These five b&w 50's gems may not be ""classics"" exactly but they are relics of a blissful bygone era when monster movies were fun. And 50's sci-fi vet Jack (""Creature from the Black Lagoon"") Arnold directed three of them. I am delighted with this purchase. The prints are great as others have said but also the selection of films are above par. They're not the shlocky ultra-cheap flicks that were also making the rounds in the 50's but the reasonably intelligent better-than-average ones. Universal has done a good job here. I'm hoping for a Volume 2 of these goodies.  Enjoy.",1161129600,5,892,4.639240506329114
2663995,5,B000IV9CDM,"I picked this up at Best Buy the other day. What a deal! These are very entertaining movies!

Tarantula is the quintisential giant bug movie. Featuring a young Clint Eastwood in a minor role. It's not quite as good as Them but better than The Deadly Mantis or Monster from Green Hell.

Incredible Shrinking Man is great entertainment with fun special effects and lots of oversized props, with a great script by Richard Matheson.

Monolith Monsters has some slow parts but is a pretty creative threat for a movie from the 50's.

Monster on the Campus is an extremely silly movie about a professor devolving into an ape-man after getting an infection from an irradiated coelocanth.

The Mole People is also silly, about some explorers who become captives in an underground civilization which never looks like more than a large room. But The Mole People are some of the coolest and most immitated monsters in movie history.

I prefer sets like this as opposed to releasing each movie seperately, since I think the average person who would buy one of these movies on its own would also be interested in at least a couple of the others. The prints on each of these look very good. As far as extras go you only get the theatrical trailer for each movie. But as nice as extras are a lot of the time for movies like these the commentary tracks and documentaries don't really add a lot to the movie, unless the commentator is either well informed or at least really clever like Joe Bob Briggs or the Mystery Science Theater guys. Anyway, I love this set. I hope to see more sets like this, maybe a volume two from Universal with some of their other movies or similar sets with movies from AIP, Fox, and Paramount.",1160697600,5,1704,4.5704918032786885
2663996,2,B000IV9CDM,"Don't get me wrong, these are classic movies, especially ""Incredible Shrinking Man"", but don't you think they deserve special treatment?  A documentary, commentary, any extras at all???  Still, this is an attractive package, and the transfers are clear.  But the casual way Universal dumped these films on the market (Best Buy only) is really an insult to the fans. Universal's monster movies are on their third release and loaded with extras (Frankenstein & Dracula most recently). Maybe someday.",1160611200,35,497,5.346153846153846

2663998,5,B000IV9CDM,"Yep, here's five classic 50s sci-fi offerings from Universal's creaky vaults!

THE MOLE PEOPLE has Agar again, this time as an archeologist in search of a lost city. Along the way, his party encounters the title creatures as well as their albino overlords! THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN stars Grant Williams as the title character, cursed to shrink after going through a mysterious cloud! THE MONOLITH MONSTERS has Williams again, this time as a geologist who must find a way to destroy the stoney invaders! Les Tremayne (War Of The Worlds, Angry Red Planet) is a newspaper man! MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS is the weakest of the collection. We get Arthur Franz (Invaders From Mars) as a scientist who turns into a murderous caveman!

2664001,5,B000IV9CDM,"As with volume 2 (reviewed elsewhere), only one film -- ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" -- is worth serious consideration as an addition to your library. (""The Monolith Monsters"", with its clever basic idea -- an inanimate enemy that petrifies people -- and surprise ending, is worth seeing once.)

The story needs no detailed description. A man is exposed to a radioactive cloud, then insecticides, the combination of which causes him to start shrinking. He goes through emotional hell as he grows smaller and smaller -- and less-important but more physically vulnerable. The plot climax, in which he fights and kills a spider to get to a slice of dessicated cake, is perfectly staged, as exciting now as it was 60 years ago.

No longer hungry, he collapses, waking to find he's even smaller. Walking through the basement screen, he muses on the purpose of his existence, recognizing that ""nothingness"" is a human idea, unknown to God. Whatever God creates has a reason for being, and cannot be lost. His existence, as a reflection of God's creation, has value in and of itself. However corny this sounds, it's sincerely moving.

The transfer is generally excellent, marred only in the opening titles with obvious vertical jitter. No attempt has been made to unnaturally sharpen the image, or reduce grain. The image proportions look ""right"" at an aspect ratio of 16:9.",1516147200,,1369,4.995614035087719

Universal, justly famous for its monster movies of the 1930s like the original DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN, rose to prominence again in the 1950s with its science-fiction movies that often had a monstrous tinge.  In THE CLASSIC SCI-FI ULTIMATE COLLECTION, it has given us a wonderful collection of five of their best from that decade.  No bells, no whistles, but flawless print quality.  In roughly descending order of quality (and allowing for differences in opinion), they are as follows:

THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957).  Genres come and go, but people will be watching this years into the future for its depiction of man in extremis.  Grant Williams stars (and holds down the last half of the picture by himself) as a man exposed to a radioactive mist who begins shrinking beyond the ability of modern medicine to control.  First he becomes a kind of freak, then shrinks so far his wife and brother cannot locate him.  The special effects, that put Williams in his basement but smaller than a matchbox or a house spider, are wonderful.  Instead of growing more horrific, the film ends on a note of transcendent grace.  It must be seen to be believed.

TARANTULA (1955).  An excellent film among ""creature features.""  A giant tarantula escapes the laboratory of an increasingly mad scientist (Leo G. Carroll), grows larger, and stalks and terrorizes a small town who are at wit's end to deal with its predations.  Special effects are excellent and impressive even today, as is the supporting cast, which includes John Agar, Mara Corday and Hank Patterson.  Look fast for a young Clint Eastwood as a jet fighter pilot.

THE MONOLITH MONSTERS (1957).  Really on the same level of quality as the above TARANTULA, this one deals with a ""monster"" in the form of minerals that fell to earth in a meteorite and grow when wet, threatening a small desert town.  The human interactions are believable, and the invading crystals, for all their other-wordliness, are very well portrayed.  The cast includes Grant Williams, Lola Albright and Les Tremayne.

THE MOLE PEOPLE (1956).  An extremely improbable scenario, yet still an absorbing movie.  John Agar and Hugh Beaumont head up a cast of archaeologists who stumble across a hidden, and literally underground, remnant of ancient Sumerian civilization.  With Cynthia Patrick as the outcast girl who is treated little better than a slave in that weird society.  The acting, particularly by the Sumerians, cannot help but be a little stagey but the sets are well done and the plot, for all its improbability, holds together.

MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS (1958).  Arthur Franz heads up a solid cast as the college scientist who is bitten by an imported coelacanth with mysterious powers.  Joanna Moore plays his terrified girlfriend.  Essentially a high-tech variation on the Jekyll-and-Hyde myth, this is the closest to the campy fright-night special that so many people consider typical of Fifties movies.  Troy Donahue has a small role as one of the rare undergraduates on this only-in-the-movies college campus.  An enjoyable ""bad movie.""

At this price -- and again, considering that print quality is pristine -- this collection is a very compelling buy.

2664034,4,B000IV9CDM,"I've been a lover of `50s monster films since, well, the `50s.  Several of these I saw on first release when younger than ten years.

In that context these films were not just ""as good as I hoped they'd be""  but better.  Yes better.

Part of that is that they are Universal Pictures.  Not super low budget junk.  The scripts were generally well written. The characters reasonably well drawn. The filming and editing good, not quicky-film schlock. And the quality of the transfers far better than I am used to seeing -- not meaning those original in-theater viewings, but the subsequent ones on TV and the many available cheap public domain multi-film sets.

My recommendation for these is thus real -- with the understanding that these were originally B level matinee movies.

Bottom line is that if you likes this type of movie you'd have to look far and wide to find anything better.",1489536000,3,885,4.694805194805195

A lot of people ""show up"" in these flicks that later became famous, such as Clint Eastwood, Alan Napier and a few others. By the way, somebody in their review of these films stated that he had looked for these films for a long time. Well, I think that I may have found them sooner than many of you and I will tell you why. The same movies and the same film company, Universal, had released these same five movies put together as the same set, but with different packaging and if I might add, far more elaborate than this package. It was released as a 3 disc set with a double fold ""digipak"" with lamination and a see-through slipcase that the digipak slides into. The secret - is that this set was released exclusively for Best Buy around 12 years ago. They also did the same for Volume Two. How do I know? I purchased both of these sets at a nearby Best Buy Store when they were released. Sorry Amazon that's the breaks. Now you get the same quality of films, which to me is fantastic, but in a singular dvd case with the same picture that appears on the transparent slipcase. Also, I knew about the change because I happened to be in a local Wal-Mart and saw these two volumes and was floored and horrified at the change in the repackaging. Sorry, that I had to tell you this and you may find the originals through a seller on Amazon. If you do, they may be very steeply priced. I paid $ 17.99 for each volume.

Quality prints, zero extras ('cept trailers), 5 films on 3 single-sided dvds, each on own tray. Recommended!",1465171200,2,322,4.649122807017544
2664057,5,B000IV9CDM,"I have reviewed several of these movies individually, so my review is limited to the collection.  The transfer quality of the disc is excellent.  The movies appear as good as the original, the film is high quality black and white with good half tones, solid blacks and good whites (""crisp"", as I often say).  The sound couldn't be much better.  If high quality is a must this is your ticket.

Each of these motion pictures is a formula, B level, B&W sci-fi flick; that is, the stars are usually pitted against an otherworldly force in an isolated area with limited resources.  There is always a romantic interest, boyfriend and girlfriend never husband and wife, which grows as the menace increases.  Most of the time love wins out, but not always.  My personal favorite is Monolith Monsters, but every one of them is fun to watch.  Just don't get too involved with the science behind the fiction.  Suspension of rationality is often necessary to enjoy the film.

The acting is normally solid, at least C to C+ level (seldom better), but the writing is definitely at a C minus level.  Special effects vary widely in competence, sometimes within the same movie!  The male leads are always hunks and the females are 1950's beautiful - and I mean really beautiful.  The men, although buffed up for the era, are small guys by modern man standards (steroids); nonetheless, I think (I have to guess in this area) most women should appreciate the eye-candy.  Of course, the costuming is G-rated all the way (no rating system in those days), but ripped shirts and tight dresses (yes, dresses and skirts) reveal enough to keep older audiences interested.  The 1990s and younger born will be amazed at how people keep virtually all their clothing on throughout the entire picture.  A good history lesson.

This is one of two sets available, and both sets are excellent.

Highly recommended IF you are a B-move sci-fi fan.

2664063,5,B000IV9CDM,"The greatest era for science-fiction cinema was inarguably the 1950's. The atom bomb and the Cold War were responsible for ushering in a tidal wave of films dealing with space travel, alien invasion, the dangers of runaway science, radioactive mutation and giant monsters.

Many of these films are revered as classics today; one of which is the superb, THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957). Directed with seriousness by genre master Jack Arnold (THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON), it tells the story of Scott Carey (Grant Williams), a man who is exposed to a mysterious radioactive mist which causes him to steadily diminish in size. Soon his marriage deteriorates, and his own household becomes a nightmarish world where life itself is a constant fight for survival.

As Carey, Williams delivers a sensitive performance that depicts the character's inner strength, and this never gets overshadowed by the enormous props and special effects, which were impressive for their time and still work fine today.

Richard Matheson wrote the intelligent screenplay which was based on his novel, and having the author adapt his own story for the screen is no doubt one reason why THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN turned out so well. It has a spiritual depth that especially permeates the last third of the film when Carey finds himself alone in his basement universe. The only dialog is Carey's voice-over narration, which gives the film an intimacy between us and our dwindling hero as we follow him through his terrifying, yet strangely illuminating experience. The ending is one of the most profound in the entire sci-fi canon as Carey, now too small to be seen by the naked eye, ponders his existence as he dissolves into infinity.

THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN is the crowning jewel in Universal's Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection, and combined with the other great titles offered here, this DVD set is one that film buffs will treasure.",1320969600,,1932,5.085173501577287
2664064,5,B000IV9CDM,"This set is a B-movie marathon, so many cliche's in each feature, but at the time of these films, this was cutting edge. They didn't wow the audience on the scale of, say, the original ""War Of The Worlds,"" but they were films which pushed the boundaries of what was considered to be normal.

Disc One: ""Tarantula,"" (1955) was directed by Jack Arnold, starring Leo G. Carrol. A story of a scientist who is looking down the road, at the future of the human race; the population is growing, and within fifty years there could very well be too many people to feed. Make your crops bigger, and you can feed more people. But as well, testing is being done on various animals, to see how different ones react to this agent - this way the farmers know what to do with their animals when this becomes commonplace. One of the creatures being tested is a tarantula...why you would want to supersize a spider is beyond me, but this is the case. During a fight which ensues (a byline in the story), the spider escapes, and since different creatures react differently, this little beast is the size of a dog when it escapes. In no time, it's bigger than a house, and everything is tried to kill, or at least, stop it.

""The Mole People,"" (1955) directed by Virgil Vogel, is one of the absolute CHEESIEST films of all time; a race of people who live underground, and have, as their slaves, creatures which resemble humans, but have no human features to their faces. They have large clawed hands and hump-backs. They clearly look like costumes, and the people who enslave them look like Star Wars - Dungeons And Dragons rejects. Bad acting and a confusing ending make it a low-budget treat.

Disc Two: ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1956) also directed by Jack Arnold. A somewhat tall, strapping man, due to accidentally inhaling a strange substance, combined with his own body chemistry, causes him to gradually shrink. Soon, he is living in a doll house his wife had to buy so he could sleep safely, as the cat is now seeing him as prey. Even though it's slightly comical, it is a very good script, exceptionally well-written, and very philosophical in nature. When the leading man is believed to be dead by his wife (she thinks the cat killed him), he is actually trapped in the basement, the size of an insect, reduced to trying to take the bait from a mouse trap to avoid starving to death. After winning a death battle with a spider, he shrinks to microscopic, and eventually atomic size, and we wonder just what happens to him after. But the narration talks of all this in the past tense, so just what happens to him?

""The Monolith Monsters,"" (1956) directed by John Sherwood, is probably the most credible of these stories. A strange stone-like substance drops from the sky, and very quickly grows when exposed to water. These stones grow into giant pillars and tumble to the ground, shattering and the pieces grow into new ones. As they grow, they fall over and crush and destroy everything around them. So the town's officials have to band together and figure how to stop this before it destroys their home town.

""Monster On Campus"" (1957) is another Jack Arnold film, the least original of the five featured films, simply a variation on the Jekyll/Hyde story. Nobody knows the main character's alter ego, they just want to know who has been attacking everyone in town. Eventually his secret is discovered at the film's conclusion.

I have appeared to give the stories away, but in films this cheesy, knowing the outcomes still doesn't spoil them. They are for the B-movie afficinados who enjoy cheap monster movies. But, as a real plus, all of these films, without exception, are beautifully restored to pristine quality. The original Godzilla film (""Gojira"" 1954), as an example, looks like it was filmed during a blizzard, with all the white blotches all over the place. The films in this set are completely devoid of this flaw. They are of the highest quality, with nice, clear sound as well.

This is a fairly inexpensive movie marathon for those nights when there isn't much to do. Get some junk food and sit back.",1300838400,4,4117,4.662534435261708
2664065,4,B000IV9CDM,"Let's face it , thats why most people buy this set. And at last, they came out with another set with this movie, so you don't have to pay $200 to some pirates for a bunch of old movies. But what a bunch! I don't remember anything much of these movies but the following.
Tarantula is a fairly standard giant insect (yes I know arachnid) movie of the fifties. Fun but not worth a second viewing.
Monolith Monsters, with Grant Williams, is an odd film about crystals which grow and crush people. And you thought people couldn't be dumb enough to be tricked by the Blob!
Incredible Shrinking Man. One of the best films of the fifties bar none. The effects are obvious today, but the miniature effects are still good. After all, the most realistic way to shrink a man is to build large scale sets and props and that's exactly what they did. Grant Williams most famous movie and a great script. Richard Matheson,the master himself, was the writer based on his own book The Shrinking Man. Matheson also wrote Trilogy of Terror (the TV special with the evil doll with the spear), I Am Legend, Kolchak the Night Stalker, and numerous Twilight Zone episodes including Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. This is a classic tale of how science fiction affects the human condition. It's not a tale of gee whiz effects of how fast or how cool sci-fi is.",1262822400,,1329,4.518672199170124

a scientist that is portrayed by LEO G.CARROL that is using the
effects of radiatian to grow any normal sized animal into a giant
to solve the world food shortage problem. One of the creatures that
he has been experimenting on happens to be a tarantula that does
indeed manage to escape from his laboratory and continues to grow to
gigantic proportions while terrorizing the local townspeople! And it's up to John Agar's character to save the day! Unfortunately,I

These are pretty much the most memorable B sci-fi's I saw during Saturday afternoon triple features as a kid. I will purchase the set... In the meantime I want to add my firm recommendation for The Incredible Shrinking Man. So glad it's out on DVD. A year or so ago I saw the film at a revival house. (Funny how they're timed just before a DVD release.) At first there were titters among the audience, who expected a camp movie. After a little while I noticed their eyes were glued to the screen, total silence and the ending was followed by applause. It's a small movie that makes a big statement, with surprisingly convincing special effects.",1232841600,,733,4.603053435114504
2664069,4,B000IV9CDM,"Grab the popcorn and dim the lights for some classic scifi entertainment!

I immediately scooped this up at first sight after seeing the set contains Tarantula on DVD...finally! This was one of my favorite monster movies as a kid and had never been released before on DVD. For me, it still holds up being just as fun to watch now as I remember.

The Incredible Shrinking Man stands above (ironically!) the rest of the features. The performances in it really give it just a bit more than the standard B-movie. It's a very interesting character study watching him try to come to grips with his diminishing stature.

The Mole Men are one of the most recognizible Universal monsters even though they don't get the love that the big guys do. It's a fun lost civilization flick. I always get a kick out of the lost people in these type of movies. The moral of this story is slavery is bad!

Monolith Monsters...you've gotta love any movie where the ""monsters"" are rocks from outer space. They're not alive, they can't chase you but in a way it's a bit creepy.

Monster on the Campus, the 2nd to last of Universal's scifi monster flicks, is a perfect example of what you expect a teen monster drive-in movie to be.

The transfers are ok and the extras are limited to trailers for each film. The packaging graphics are perfect for the set. Hopefully this will not be the only release of some of these films as they need more bonus material, especially ""Man"".",1228176000,,1450,4.5576923076923075
2664070,3,B000IV9CDM,"Perhaps it is all because of Grant Williams. Williams was a B film actor who was best known for his starring and titular role in The Incredible Shrinking Man, generally acknowledged as one of the most literate and high quality B sci fi films from the 1950s. In watching the DVD of his next noted film, The Monolith Monsters, I was struck by how well written a film that film is also, even as it is another B sci fi film. No, Williams' role in the 77 minute black and white film, from 1957-as was The Incredible Shrinking Man, is not as important as his role in the prior film, but his mere presence, it seems, raises the bar for the other actors. In a sense, he was a B film version of Marlon Brando, who always seemed to elicit the best out of his A film co-stars.
  Another positive for the film is that, of all the 1950s horror/monsters from space films, The Monolith Monsters is likely among the most plausible scenarios to be explored- almost like an early version of The Andromeda Strain, save that the monsters are not microscopic and biological, but huge and chemically reacting black crystal columns that have no agenda. They are not aliens nor atomically irradiated mutants, just meteor debris that grows when it comes into contact with regular water, and is destroyed by salt water. The former property is shown early in the film when a rock gets some water accidentally poured on it when a car radiator overheats and its driver pours in water. Even worse is that the rocks can turn people to stone, once the water has activated their mysterious otherworldly properties.
  The credit for the bulk of this film's success, however, belongs less with its director, John Sherwood, who was directing only his third low budget film, and more with the film's co-writer- the science fiction writer and film director Jack Arnold, who also helmed two classics of 1950s sci fi and horror: The Creature From The Black Lagoon and This Island Earth. There are the standard sci fi inexplicabilities; such as all the right folk are right where they are needed at exactly the right time, no one calls the Feds, nor the National Guard, petrifying limbs would fall off with gangrene, etc., and other sorts of silly science, but the wit and dialogue (especially in a brief scene with veteran B film actor William Schallert as a discombobulated meteorologist trying to tell Dave Miller when the thunderstorm is expected to end) are first rate. Arnold's co-writers on this film were Robert Fresco and Norman Jolly, but the film has all the hallmarks of a classic Arnold film. Why he did not direct it is probably only because he was juggling many other film projects at the same time.
  The film also pulls off a rare feat- its ominous opening voiceover monologue by Paul Frees, who forebodingly intoned the opening of many sci fi films, marveling over the wonders of `Science!', and such, and was also a voice for The Rocky And Bullwinkle cartoon a few years later. His booming voice was ripe for parody, and that he undercuts some of his own pomp shows how good an orator he was, for he opens this film with a monologue that both satirizes and pays homage to even worse monologues from far worse films. It starts out, `From time immemorial, the Earth has been bombarded by objects from outer space; bits and pieces of the universe, piercing our atmosphere, in an invasion that never ends,' and gets even better, or worse, from there. Then we see the meteor crash, which is another version of the same scene from the earlier Arnold-directed Universal film, It Came From Outer Space. But, the film also succeeds with some fairly innovative low budget special effects, from cinematographer Ellis W. Carter. The effect of the growing monoliths, which grow in size and depth, was never revealed, but likely done by the optical illusion of forced perspective, by pushing the monoliths through the set, for the upward height, and moving the camera toward them as the camera zooms outward. A similar technique was used to great effect in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo.
  The DVD is part of a five film, three DVD package called The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection. Well, not really, but The Monolith Monsters shares its DVD with Grant Williams' other film of note, The Incredible Shrinking Man, directed by Arnold. The other three films in the set are Tarantula- another Arnold flick, The Mole People, and Monster On The Campus- which featured Troy Donahue. Despite the Ultimate in the pack's title, the only extra feature The Monolith Monsters comes with is its original theatrical trailer. As Arnold and Williams are key 1950s sci fi figures, an expert in that era's genre films would have made for a potentially great audio commentary. On the plus side, Universal did a superb job in restoring the film- the transfer is stunning and almost wholly blemish free, and in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Also, of note, is a quite effective film score by a young and uncredited Henry Mancini.
  The Monolith Monsters is not a great film, by any means, but it's a damned good B sci fi film, leagues above the usual crap from that era, or any era, and because of its hints of plausibility, and being played straight, it traverses that thin line between cheesiness and real drama, and tropes toward the better side.

The Mole People (1956)
So it starts out with an archaeological team in the 50's that stumbles upon this underground civilization of a lost dynasty of Sumerians, who have apparently failed to evolve over the past 5,000 years. The plot becomes a bit fuzzy here, but pretty much only three people survive. The albinos decide to sacrifice these three survivors, but they escape. One of them dies, but the other two Dr. Bentley (John Agar) and Dr. Bellamin (Hugh Beaumont) escape by shining a flashlight in the albinos and mole people's faces. Wait- who are these mole people? They are mutant humanoid mole-type creatures that are the mistreated slaves of the albinos and resemble the sand people from Star Wars. Just like the albinos, living underground has made them highly sensitive to light. The Sumerian Priest (Alan Napier) believes that the flashlight is the sacred fire of their goddess, Ishtar. They come to believe that Bentley and Bellamin are messengers of Ishtar. They give Bentley a slave, a beautiful woman named Adad (Cynthia Patrick) who is shunned by the albinos because of her tan skin. Of course, she and Bentley fall in love and he promises to take her with him when they escape.

The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957)
Scott Carey (Grant Williams) and his wife Louise (Randy Stuart) are sunning themselves on their cabin cruiser.  While his wife is below deck, a low mist passes over him. Scott, lying in the sun, is sprinkled with glittery particles that quickly evaporate. Later he is accidentally sprayed with an insecticide while driving and, in the next few days, he finds that he has begun to shrink. First just a few inches, so that his clothes no longer fit, then a little more. Soon he is only three feet tall, and a national curiosity. At six inches tall he can only live in a doll's house and even that becomes impossible when the cat breaks in! Scott flees to the cellar, his wife thinks he has been eaten by the cat and the door to the cellar is closed, trapping him in the littered room where, menaced by a giant spider, he struggles to survive. The most celebrated of director Jack Arnold's science fiction films and a VERY welcome addition to dvd!

The Monolith Monsters (1957)
A strange black meteor crashes near the town of San Angelo and litters the countryside with fragments. When a storm exposes these fragments to water, they grow into skyscraper-sized monoliths!  Which then topple and shatter into thousands of pieces that grow into monoliths themselves and repeat the process. Any humans in the way are crushed or turned into human statues. The citizens of San Angelo desperately try to save themselves and the world from the spreading doom.

Now a second set is coming with five more classics from the Atomic Age!  First is THE DEADLY MANTIS featuring special effects by Willis (KING KONG) O'Brien.  Second is LAND UNKNOWN which features Jock Mahoney in a journey to a lost world beneath the Artic ice.  Third is CULT OF THE COBRA, the story of a group of GI's whoe are cursed after they are caught sneaking into a private, oriental ceremony.  Marshal Thompson and Faith Domergue star.  The fourth is THE LEECH WOMAN featuring Gloria (I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE) Talbot and Grant (THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN) Williams.  This is an entertaining flick with one major drawback, Gloria Talbot gets croaked by the Leech Lady!  Oh, boy, you're gonna get your woman!  The fifth is DR. CYCLOPS which stars Albert Decker as a looney scientist who shrinks a handful of people and then cruely dominates them until...well, it isn't hard to figure out what the little folks have got on their minds!
This set sounds like another winner, though it's not as impressive as the first one.  Still, this set adds five more titles to my collection that I have been waiting for.
Now, how about the remaining flicks on my want list.  I wanted to put up a list on Amazon but they won't let me list items that they don't have for sale so I thought I'd list them in this review.  Here goes:
ONE MILLION B. C. (Thirties Caveman classic with Victor Mature)
WHEN DINOISAURS RULED THE EARTH (Jim Danforth animation & Victori Vetri)
CALTIKI, THE IMMORTAL MONSTER (Lighting/ Mario Bava & a BLOB-like monster)
GOG (Sci-Fi gem from Ivan Tors which stars Richard Egan)
WORLD WITHOUT END (Excellent movie with Rod Taylor & Hugh Marlow)
IT CONQUERORED THE WORLD(Corman classic with Peter Graves & Lee Van Cleef)
COSMIC MONSTERS (stars Forrest Tucker & a lotta giant insects)
THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN (A Burt I. Gordon classic that belongs on DVD!)
THE CYCLOPS (Unofficial sequel to the Colossal Man flicks/ Gloria Talbot)
I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF (Herman Cohen classic with Michael Landon)
I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN (Another Cohen Classic starring Gary Conway)
INVASION OF THE SAUCER-MEN (What's keepin' this one from DVD!?!)
HAND OF DOOM (A wacky but fun John Agar romp!)
FROM HELL IT CAME (Where's the killer tree when ya need him?  Not on DVD!)
MONSTER FROM PIEDRAS BLANCAS(A Creature wanna-be who carries human heads!)
THE UNDEAD (Another Roger Corman classic featuring Allison Hayes)
NOT OF THIS EARTH(Another Corman classic with Paul Birch& Beverly Garland)
AROUND THE WORLD UNDER THE SEA(Adventure w/ Lloyd Bridges & Shirley Eaton)
BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN (T. Rex, Guy Madison & Patricia Medina)
DAMNATION ALLEY (Another Adventure Sci-Fi that should be on DVD!)
THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE (Good but weird fifties horror movie)
COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK (A strange little ""giant robot"" movie)
BRAIN EATERS (a dark, documentary style sci-fi movie)
HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS (Lee, Cushing, Price, & Carradine!!!)
Here's two more that I've never seen but I will if they come out on DVD!
MAGNETIC MONSTERS ( I think it's another Ivan Tors Production)
CURUCU, BEAST OF THE AMAZON (Beverly Garland and, I think John Bromfield)
C'mon Universal, MGM, Warner Bros. and the rest.  Let's get these movies out on DVD as soon as possible!  How 'bout it?",1188777600,7,3450,4.8155668358714045
2664080,4,B000IV9CDM,"Two or three of these movies are truly classics, and overall the collection is worth every bit of the fifteen or twenty dollars it originally sold for.

Unfortunately, every time a DVD goes 'out of print' for a few months, slime-ball scalpers show up on Amazon trying to sell it at five or ten times it's original price.

Take a lesson from the ""This Island Earth"" DVD, that I can remember seeing scalped for 180 dollars or more when it went out of production a few years back, but which is now 'back in print' and available on Amazon everyday for less than 12 dollars.

So I will be looking forward to seeing this DVD collection back in production, both so I can buy another set (I gave the original away as a Christmas present for a friend), and so I can have the satisfaction of watching all the greedy scalpers who were holding out for that big payoff see the value of their stock drop to next to nothing (Gee, maybe if you had been willing to accept only a 300% markup you might have sold at a nice profit, but now, toooo bad!!!)

I can highly recommend this set, but NOT at scalper prices.  My advise is to just wait until the set is available again through Amazon at the normal price.  This set will probably be back, and if not the individual movies are bound to be released again (perhaps this time with extras).",1187827200,12,1321,4.327935222672065
2664081,5,B000IV9CDM,"As a kid from the 1950's I sure remember these movies. And when I found them in one collection as Classic Sci-Fi, I jumped all over it. Now, what shocked me was the going price at over $100 for the DVD set that I paid $15 for just a year ago at BestBuy's. What happened?! Did BestBuy only sale a certain number and that was it? Whatever, I still enjoy watching old 50's sci-fi movies. In this collection, you have five movies. Of those, I really only like three. Tarantula, Monolith Monsters, and The Incredible Shrinking Man. The other two, The Mole People and Monster on the Campus, are campy at best and only worth about one viewing.
Tarantula is your basic science run amouck. The movie is noteable as Clint Eastwood's first, althought a very small part. They pretty much have to burn the whole town down to destroy the creature.
Monolith Monster is unique in that it's not your convential creature, but instead rocks from outer space that keep growing.
My favorite, and one of the BEST sci-fi movies ever is the Incredible Shrinking Man. Almost like a documentary but told from the prespective of the shrinking man, you follow his plight from the beginning. While on a boat, he is caught in some kind of radioactive cloud. Soon, he begins to shrink until he winds up being chased by his pet cat and escapes into the basement where the fun really begins.
There are many 'classic collections' out there, but for my $15, this is the best!",1185667200,,1440,4.542307692307692

TO THE CONTRARY IT IS  INTELLIGENT; ALBEIT SOMEWHAT SLOW-MOVING AND LACKING IN ACTION, VERY MUCH LIKE A CLASSIC SCI-FI SHORT STORY.  THIS IS A VERY GOOD COLLECTION AND WORTH THE PRICE FOR THE TWO MOVIES ""INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN"" AND ""TARANTULA""  BOTH OF WHICH I REMEMBER FROM LOCAL TV MATINEES IN THE '60S.

If you are a fan of movies with titles like ""Them!"", ""It Conquered The World"", and (for all you Alison Krauss fans) ""Attack of The 50-foot Woman"", you will loooove this collection.

Tarantula - Science goes awry and creates a deadly spider that just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
Monolith Monsters - Deadly rocks fall from space.  They grow, topple, and shatter.  Then the pieces do the same and a town lies in their path if they can't be stopped.
The Incredible Shrinking Man - The classic story of a man who begins shrinking after being exposed to a strange cloud.  Just how small can he get and still survive?
The Mole People -  An underground race has not seen the sun in millennia.  Explorers find them and their civilization becomes unstable.
Monster on the Campus - A scientist on campus discovers a way to cause creatures to revert to an earlier evolutionary state.  He tests it on himself and becomes the title creature.

Five classic films at a good price.  Picture and sound quality are good.  Check it out.",1182124800,3,1047,4.66120218579235

All movies have a Jack Arnold influence and for the time the special effects are pretty good. Lots of people smoking cigarettes, lots of sreams, even a couple of people falling over while being chased.

The monolity monsters is probably the weaker of the 5 movies, giant rocks overtaking the world is hard to get excited about.

2664088,3,B000IV9CDM,"A nice little collection this.

What I can't understand is why release a 3 disc set that contains 5 films?

The final disc contains the entertaining but avergae ""Monster On Campus"".

Surely a sixth film could have been found? Or two additional other films?

All films are 4:3 except ""Shrinking Man"" which is presnted in anamorphic widescreen.

The print and sound quality on all films is very good. Not prefect, but very good.

No extras beyond trailers, but do you really need them?

I basically bought this collection to see ""The Monolith Monsters"" a film that's stuck in my mind since I was a kid. Certainly not disappointed on seeing it again. A good hard science sci-fi film. Tarantula, (is that Clint Eastwood in that jet?), is wonderfully entertaining especially estimates for world population in the distant 1990s. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is a classic 50s SF movie and worth buying the collection to see. ""The Mole People"" is interesting, but has a very odd ending.

My only complaint (and the reason for four stars instead of five) is that the studio skimped on extras; the films don't even have scene-by-scene menus. Given the price of this package, that seems a bit cheap.",1177545600,3,486,4.34065934065934

I remember seeing all of these on the Friday Night Creature Feature during the 1960's and early 1970's, or was it Saturday nights? ""Tarantula"" is one of my favorite 1950's movies and think the special effects are quite good for the time. Any way the music is all very good in all of these and it seems anything Jack Arnold directs is always better for having him at the helm. (Disregarding Giligans Island!)The same goes for John Agar of which he stars in 2 of these. The weakest would have to be ""The Mole People"" but it is still pretty enjoyable.

I've now watched all five movies. The print quality is unbelievably good for such old (50+ years) B-grade, SF films that were considered quite disposable at the time. Sound quality is also excellent. Only Shrinking Man is widescreen; the others are fullscreen. Sure it would've been better to have them all widescreen. It would've been great if they were free too, or all came with a Rolls Royce.

My ratings for the movies:

INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN: 5 STARS. Other reviewers have written extensively about this masterpiece. This is not just a great 1950s movie, or a great SF movie; it's a great movie, period. There isn't a shot out of place or a poorly-written scene. Tons of perfect details go into it. (Check out the shrinking man's clothes as he is reduced to child-size; he starts wearing kid's clothes, including sneakers.) The scene with the spider is of course nerve-wracking, but the scene I'd forgotten about was the one with the mouse trap (man trap?). Nail biting...and ultimately, heartbreaking. If you've never seen it, get this collection for this movie alone.

MONOLITH MONSTERS: 4 STARS. A little slow, but the unique nature of the menace gets big points from me. A meteor lands in the desert, and starts growing upon contact with water. Human beings who touch it are turned into stone. Very creepy scenes involving a little girl, and surprisingly good effects. How scary can big crystals be, you ask? Well, pretty creepy actually. This one really benefits from a clear soundtrack as the overgrown rocks tumble and shatter only to regrow. A pleasant surprise.

THE MOLE PEOPLE: 4 STARS. Another pleasant surprise. John Agar, who I adore, goes underground with another heroic American (yay!) and craven Frenchman (boo!) and discovers an underground civilization. Or two. At times it feels a lot like a lost episode of Star Trek, but some money and thought went into the sets and costunes, and Agar plays the silliness with gusto, as he always did. I'd never seen this before and found it better than I had expected.

TARANTULA: 4 STARS. I must admit, this was SLIGHTLY disappointing for me. I remember this from 1970s Saturday afternoon TV, and it wasn't as good as I remembered. Still very fun, with John Agar again and a lab fill with overgrown creepies, one of which is the big spider who goes galloping off thruogh the desert. But as far as actual mayhem goes, there's relatively little. It DOES have that scene where the guys are trying to get the car started, as the tarantula comes closer...and closer...and closer...

MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS: 3 AND A HALF STARS. The weakest of the bunch, admittedly, but this is still a fun ride. Anything with a giant dragonfly and monster-inducing coelocanth is okay by me. Basically a retelling of the Jeckyll and Hyde story with a ""modern"" scientific veneer, it's unintentially funny in spots and in others, surprisingly, still pretty effective. (An early death is quite chilling.) There are also cringe-inducing exchanges of dialogue: DONALD: ""Do you know anything about paleontology?"" MOLLY: ""I know very attractive men study it."" Uggghhh!

So all in all, a fantastic collection, great quality, and a terrific price. You can watch a different movie every night for 5 nights. What's not to love? 5+ stars for the overall quality of the set brings up an overall 5-star rating.",1174521600,10,3466,4.89267461669506

When it comes to low budget SciFi you can't go wrong with this collection. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" should be in every SciFi collection. It is to me more cerebral and deserves more respect. It wasn't like alot of other schlock that came out in the 50s. I do wish they had included a documentary with this set that had told about the makers of the movies and some background on what life was like at the time. I grew up on these movies in the 1950s and early 1960s and just watching the movies alone doesn't quite give you the whole picture. The rest the movies like ""Tarantula"" and ""The Mole People"" are quite entertaining and not nearly as serious. I highly recommend this collection if for no other reason to show there is an interest in these movies still. Hopefully it will prompt them to come out with more collections and maybe even include a featurette or documentary and a cartoon from the time period like they use to show at the Drive-in Theater. I ordered mine some time ago and wanted to get back here to let everyone know the quality is good and this is a great value. The whole family will probably enjoy these old low budget SciFi movies.

2664113,5,B000IV9CDM,"I saw all of these films decades ago when they were first featured in theaters.  This DVD set has captured the quality of ""big-screen"" presentation to a ""T"" -- no graininess, no flickering, no streaking.  It was a real pleasure to see these classic films in their original state.",1171324800,4,279,4.673469387755102
2664114,5,B000IV9CDM,"this is an outstanding collection of 1950's sci-fi. The quality is excellent with the first complete unedited to fit in commercials version of some I've ever seen. The films themselves are the classic THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, the excellent TARANTULA, my personal favorite THE MONOLITH MONSTERS, and two fair B's THE MOLE PEOPLE and MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS. Also the price is unbelivably low only about 26 dollars including shipping an absolute bargain.",1170892800,4,455,5.2465753424657535
2664115,4,B000IV9CDM,"Get ready for a heavy dose of 1950s Science Fiction cinema with ""The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection"". This 3-Disc collection includes five of Universal's classic Sci-fi movies (The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Mole People, Tarantula, The Monolith Monsters and Monster on the Campus). In ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1957), Ad writer Robert Carrey (Grant Williams) is exposed to radioactive fog and gradually shrinks with no end in sight. In ""Tarantula"" (1955), a test spider injected with an experimental growth serum turns to a gigantic monster that terrorizes the countryside. In ""The Mole People"" (1956), a team of archeologists discover a lost civilization living deep beneath the earth. In ""The Monolith Monsters"" (1957), strange black meteors grow into giant monoliths that threatened the citizens of a small desert town. In ""Monster on the Campus"" (1958), the DNA of a prehistoric fish turns a university professor (Arthur Franz) into a murderous Neanderthal. All five classic films are fine examples of 1950s Sci-Fi cinema, but ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" and ""Tarantula"" are the real highlights of this collection. Directed by Jack Arnold (Creature of the Black Lagoon), ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" was one of Universal's best 1950s Sci-Fi films and features some effective camera work, good visual effects and a surprising finish. ""Tarantula"" was inspired by the 1954 Sci-Fi movie ""Them!"" and includes a brief appearance of screen favorite Clint Eastwood.

Fans of the Sci-Fi genre won't want to miss out on ""The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection"". Though ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is presented in a nice 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format, the other four movies are presented in standard full screen format. The 3-Disc collection contains a clean B&W video transfer and a well balanced 2.0 Dolby Digital sound. Fans expected some commentaries or short featurettes in this release but its only supplemental extras are the films' original trailers. Overall, ""The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection"" gets a ""B"".",1170633600,8,2040,5.476190476190476
2664116,3,B000IV9CDM,"Doesn't anyone care about these classic movies, yes it's great that they still exist but Universal needs to acknowledge that they reflect a time in our history, instead of just pumping them out for more money without including historians comments and views (yeah it would cost them a little more money but...) without which the real importance of these films will be lost for all time. The ISM is a true classic deserving far better treatment, Mole People has a Mini Mite figure for Gods sake, Tarantula is the first movie from the 50's that I remember (not the best but...) and if no one else would be willing to comment on it's place in history I would (for FREE, because our children deserve more). So many silent films don't even exist because the studios didn't think they had any further value, some of us were even conceived during the showing of these films (anyone remember drive-ins?). To see them LUMPED together without any perspective, have SOME respect for the people that pay you're bills today. I refuse to give the managers of these studios any money in this day and age without them giving some reflection on what brought them to this point in time, artists and craftsmen who spent their lives (Entire LIVES in some some instances) creating these works of art for the future to review, to see them dismissed as a compilation worthy only as a footnote in film  history is insulting to those of us raised on these works. I realize that the studios are now run by young kids who don't have much respect for this time-period (it doesn't connect to them) or genre, and while these films aren't ""The Maltese Falcon"" they still deserve our respect. There is so much to say about the ""Incredible Shrinking Man"" in particular that I'm amazed that the studio thinks so little of this film that they included it in a 1950's collection without ANY comments. I love this movie ""ISM"" so much because it represents the psyche of American men at this time as the world was transforming itself in an uncertain future, that to see it relegated with such other quickie fare shocks me into keeping my wallet in my pocket, sorry guys thanks for not burning the prints (still got the VHS copies) but, no sale.",1170115200,5,2205,4.625
2664117,4,B000IV9CDM,"This marvelous set of cheesy and classic sci-fi/horror films is a great one stop shop for fans of 50's monster movies. The best film here is ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" based on Richard Matheson's novel. With a screenplay by Matheson (that was revised with a rewritten script by Richard Alan Simmons a writer for ""Columbo"" that changed the ending and that until recently Matheson hated). Is this set worth getting just for that film? Heck yeah. The transfer looks extremely good, with a crisp, sharp picture. We get the original theatrical trailer as well (which was narrated by Orson Welles). ""TISM"" is in its original widescreen format.

The other films vary from good to cheesy fun. ""Tarantula"" is one of the better giant insects on the loose movies (it followed in the wake of the classic ""Them!""). ""The Monolith Monsters"" is also quite good and was based on a story that Jack Arnold (""The Incredible Shrinking Man"") came up with. He didn't direct it as he had already left the studio but it's got solid performances all around and some imaginative touches. It's probably the third best sci-fi film (outside of ""Shrinking Man"" and ""It Came From Outer Space"" which has been released to DVD but not in its original 3-D incarnation)to come from Universal during the 50's.

""Monster on the Campus"" and ""The Mole People"" are two entertaining bits of schlock. The former featuring John Agar (also in ""Tarantula)and the latter featuring Arthur Franz (best known for ""The Atomic Submarine"" and ""Invaders from Mars"" as well as his numerous TV appearences). Both look quite good and are presented in their full screen presentation which, if I'm not mistaken, is the way they originally were released. We get theatrical trailers for the films as well.

The only thing that's missing is a critical appreciation for ""Shrinking Man"". It would have been nice to have a commentary track from Richard Matheson or a film historian. The same could be said for the better flicks here but for the price it's hard to argue.",1168732800,20,2008,4.8654970760233915
2664118,3,B000IV9CDM,"The plot is simple: after being exposed to a mysterious, possibly radioactive mist, a man finds he is slowly but inexorably diminishing in size... His pride, job, marriage and, finally, his very life are threatened as his relation to the world about him changes daily... A cellar floor becomes a stark desert where giant insects hunt prey and the only food consists of rock-like crumbs of stale cheese left in mousetraps...

Arnold's expert use of huge sets and props provides excitement, but it is the philosophical script that supplies its rare power: complacent modern man, forced back on his primitive wits simply to survive, finally discovers hope, peace and meaning in the realization that everything in the cosmos, however small or insignificant, has its own place and worth...",1167609600,8,784,5.125
