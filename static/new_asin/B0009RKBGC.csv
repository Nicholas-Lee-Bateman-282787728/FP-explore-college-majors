2313471,5,B0009RKBGC,"I received my Cesar Millan dvd today and thrilled with it. I truly believe he is an amazing man who has helped me learn more about my dog, a highly energetic Jack Russell Terrier who has some behavior issues.  I commend Cesar and what he has taught me as well as others and I continually tell all my friends and family dog owners to watch his show on the National Geographic channel and to purchase this DVD.

If more dog owners would watch his show and purchase his DVD, People Training for Dogs, I believe in my heart many more owners would understand the species and not give their dogs up to shelters due to behavior the owners never took time to understand in their pet. A MUST have for every Dog Owner.  My best to Caesar and his pack!",1116979200,9,741,4.2785714285714285

2313484,3,B0009RKBGC,"Cesar's ""Mastering Leadership Series"" is not as useful as the many seasons of his program, also available from Amazon on DVD.  The single DVD's in this series are too short and too much in a lecture format, and not nearly as good a value as any season of his National Geographic channel Dog Whisperer.  Still, it's Cesar, and he's really good at what he does.",1361145600,,359,4.507692307692308

2313487,3,B0009RKBGC,"[...]

I really enjoyed listening to Cesar Millan talking about the psychology of dogs, however, it is stated as a ""People Training for Dogs"".  I feel it is incorrectly titled and should be something like ""Dog Psychology 101"" because it had very little to do with training a dog.  The majorityof the DVD was explaining how dog's think and react versus how they are trained.  I think his TV show does a much better job in escribing specific behavioral problems and by knowing the psychology of the dog you are able to control or manage the animal's behavior.  At best it teaches you to manage dog's behavior but it doesn't ""train"" people like he says.",1321833600,,650,4.6173913043478265
2313488,4,B0009RKBGC,"In this video, Cesar simply states the facts. It isn't entertaining like the show. It is in a classroom or lecture type setting. It has no frills. The information in this video is usually touched on during his show, but it is given in more detail than it usually is. If you choose this video, you need to be ready to learn and absorb the information. It is not a training video. It is meant to help you understand your dog and what is needed to fullfill the relationship between the two of you. This video would be good for people who already own dogs or if you are considering getting a dog.",1311033600,3,592,4.247787610619469
2313489,4,B0009RKBGC,"This isn't supposed to be a training video, it explains a lot about a humans part in the dog/human relationship.

I suggest it for anyone looking to get a dog or anyone having issues with their dog.",1299542400,2,298,3.901639344262295
2313490,1,B0009RKBGC,"I recently got a young adult dog and a puppy which both need training so I decided to do it myself. Watching a little Dog Whisperer led me to this video which turned out to be totally useless. He explains the absolute basics on how to treat your dog, but no tips on how to actually train your dog to do anything. Useless.",1293926400,3,321,4.111111111111111
2313491,5,B0009RKBGC,"This video is the core of Cesar's philosophy on dog psychology. It's his whole theory in a nut shell. His whole show is based on these ideas. It is great for someone who doesn't watch his show, or wants it all in one place.",1291334400,3,223,4.090909090909091
2313492,3,B0009RKBGC,"We love Ceasar Milan!! We were disappointed to but several of his DVD's however.
Don't get me wrong. They are entertaining and informative yet they do not really show you ""HOW"" to train them.
It is basically like watching his TV shows.",1285372800,,235,4.619047619047619
2313493,5,B0009RKBGC,"I sometimes think that people believe Cesar's dog psychology lessons are dog training techniques.  As he says so many times ""I rehabilitate dogs;  I train people.""  He is introducing the dog's mind and heart to us and helping us to communicate in a way dogs understand.  The key is dog psychology, not the human psychology that many of us think relates to dogs.

I have gotten tremendous help from all his DVD's ; for example, I can keep my dogs under control during walks now (well, mostly!)and walk all of them at once.  He has opened my mind to a whole new perception of dogs, and it is really paying off.

I believe that the DVD should be watched several times to really understand what's going on, and to pick up things that might have been missed before.  It works if you pay attention and work!",1223251200,4,801,4.438356164383562
2313494,2,B0009RKBGC,"I recently purchased Cesar Millan's new DVD ""Mastering Leadership"" because we are getting rwo new puppies in 1 month.
All the things that I've heard him say on his TV shows were said many times on this DVD.  What I was hoping for is just exactly how you start out with a puppy and I didn't get that at all! I thought it was somewhat of a waste of money. Quite disappointed.",1219017600,,373,4.180555555555555
2313495,5,B0009RKBGC,"The title of this excellent DVD says it all.  This DVD does not give the viewer information how to train your dog, nor does it give you insights on what dog would be best for you.

However, when you finish viewing ""People Training for Dogs: The Dog Whisperer,"" you will have a much better understanding how a dog perceives his surroundings including his owner. The viewer will realize the psychology of the dog is different from the psychology of man.

More often than not pet owners think of the dog as we, as humans, think of other humans.  In a nutshell, it is not so much about the pet owner, but about the dog.  A dog does not know nor does he or she care, or for that matter, know if the owner is the president of the United States, a billionaire, or a ""will work for food"" person. What they know is the energy the owner shares daily and the activities the owner shares with the dog.

Cesar Milan leaves the viewers with a much better understanding of the psychology of a dog. The understanding the owner should know that everything having to do with the dog is about the dog and not about the owner.

Cesar Milan says, 'It is a mistake to humanize a dog.  Pet owners fail to understand their dog, or pet.""

I strongly recommend this excellent, and astonishing DVD ""People Training for Dogs: The Dog Whisperer"" by Cesar Milan to all dog and or pet owners.  No matter how professional of a dog owner you are, you will be pleasantly surprised.",1216771200,5,1447,4.385767790262173
2313496,5,B0009RKBGC,"After watching Cesar Millan's Dog Whisperer and buying this DVD, I've learned so much on disciplining my dogs.

It's amazing, after only a couple of weeks our 10 year old labs are sooo well behaved! All we did was walk them everyday (instead of every other day), remaining calm and assertive, etc. which this DVD shows you how to do.

Thanks Cesar! (Amazing, Cesar's talented, sure, but a lot of the skills can also be learned)",1204502400,2,427,4.605263157894737

Which, he explains, have nothing to do with my needs.  I was so anxious to put his advice into action.  I noticed a difference in my dogs immediately.  When I was calm, they were calm.  Amazing!  I even got tickled at them because they were watching me so intently.  We've got a ways to go, but we've definitely made progress.  Great DVD.",1201737600,4,480,4.3522727272727275

2313503,1,B0009RKBGC,This video was recommended to me but I was disappointed. It dealt more with the general behavior of dogs rather than ways of training a dog to respond to various commands. A more specific training book was what I had in mind.,1180310400,4,225,4.380952380952381
2313504,5,B0009RKBGC,"This is a must have for dog owners.  Ceasar cuts to the chase and opens our eyes to how we create the problems our dogs have.

Just understanding their world helps tremendously and Ceasar pointing out human behavior and how it affects our dogs is fabulous........a great buy!",1173398400,6,430,4.487179487179487
2313505,5,B0009RKBGC,"When I first watched this video several months ago, I was expecting to find some serious techniques that I could apply right away; a magic bullet to tell me in 5 easy steps or less, how to be my dog's leader.  At that time, I have to honest, I was disappointed, and felt that I should not write a review because it would be negative.  It is important to note, that at that time, there were NO reviews yet.  Recently, I have listened to most of (so far) ""Cesar's Way,"" on cd, watched the first season on DVD about 5 times, and his 2nd DVD in the Mastering Leadership series, ""Becoming a Pack Leader.""

NOW I GET IT!!  ""People Training,"" IS the primary, fundamental, very important, information, that must be absorbed before proceeding to any ""training,"" exercises.  Please buy it, watch it several times, rent or buy the DVDs of the previous seasons, read or listen to ""Cesar's Way,"" and watch Mastering Leadership, Vol 2.  ""People Training,"" is Vol. 1.  Even if you don't ever fully incorporate Cesar's techniques into your training techiniques, your life with your dog will be enriched due the understanding you will gain about the nature of dogs.  You will never regret it.",1156982400,113,1175,4.63768115942029
2313506,2,B0009RKBGC,"This DVD is over priced - only one-hour show shouldn't be charged more then $9.99 plus S&H although I support Cesar very much and I had read his book Cesar's Way as well as I recently ordered his new DVD (Dog Whisperer With Cesar Millan - The Complete First Season (2004)), and I hardly missed his any show. I love nature and animals. I am licensed falconer and I trained my own dogs. I respect his talent, and learn a lot about dog behavior to watching his show, but I disagreed with other reviewers to giving him just positive rating and ignored all other negative facts. Being a strong critic is better and it will help Cesar to improve his work.

Back to this DVD... if you are watching him on National Geography channel then do not throw away your hard earning money to buy this DVD. One hour show and cheap quality packing, bottom line this is a complete rip off.",1156809600,29,869,4.364197530864198
2313507,5,B0009RKBGC,"This was the psychotherapy session which saved my dog's life. Its profound insight of human and dog psychology is simple but has a highly refined way of confronting and solving behavioral issues. When my dog was having a panic attack, and I was afraid of losing his life, a piece of cheese or a little clicking device had no place to solve the problem what so ever. Luckily I've got a professional trainer who happened to have the same concept and method as Mr. Milan had.

They were easy to walk, happy to go and all was well.  Then this spring came a challenge.  Two new clients were NOT happy go lucky...  I needed help.  People Training for Dogs helped me to understand what my charges needed.  It showed me how I needed to be the pack leader to these two insecure dogs.  Once I change my psychology, the dogs were right along with me.  We have since had happier and more productive walks.  The DVD has also shown me the dogs side of the story.  This is a must for pet owners and dog walkers old and new.  You can teach an older person some new tricks. Thank you Cesar and Pack...",1151020800,32,732,4.18705035971223
2313509,5,B0009RKBGC,"Cesar is a master at showing people how to handle their dogs.  I've seen some complaints about the lack of dog interaction on the DVD, but the way I see things that is sorta the point.  As he says on his show, he rehabilitates dogs....he *trains* people.  Heck, the DVD title is ""People Training for Dogs"", not the other way around.  My girlfriend and I just got our 11-week old beagle puppy (Carlin) over the weekend, and Cesar's messages ring lound and clear every time we interact with the pup.  Calm and assertive....calm and submissive.....exercise, dicipline, affection....animal, dog, breed, name.....To be honest I was a little worried about getting my first pet dog at 33 years old, but following Cesar's advice things have been less daunting and more enjoyable than I ever imagined.  The parts where he feeds his pack and places the kitten amongst his dogs were spectacular demonstrations of his method.  We can't wait for the next DVD!",1146614400,31,946,4.875
2313510,5,B0009RKBGC,"Mom recorded a bunch of TV shows in a not-so-subtle hint because I have a two extremely high-energy border-collie/retriever mixes--wilder than previous dogs I've had.

I was hooked!

Cesar's messages are very, very compatible with standard 4H dog training. He presents it in a very understandable way though on TV.

I noted he was very specific on ""putting out the calm, assertive energy"" --which some readers took literally & grew angry that he didn't explain how to grow that ""magic energy"" or whatever... He means carry your face, hands, body & voice in a very calm, quiet, assertive manner, like a top executive, not like a scared, shivering little girl, or an aggressive mean Tasmanian Devil, or a Flapping Bozo the Clown. Note this works on people too.

I wholeheartedly agree on exercise working like Dog (& human) Prozac, and it creates a more manageable dog. 4H, again! It also works to control anxiety & concentration in humans & animals.

I never thought about dog backpacks and have HUGE hopes for it. I'd been trying to think of something that'd wear them down a bit. Currently, I have to struggle and fight my way to the 4th lap around the block---by then, they are much calmer & easier to walk. They are easy to walk by themselves, but maybe that pack mentality makes them nutso together. If I leave one at home, he screams, jumps on the window.

On one show, he had the dog pull a skateboarder or roller-skating person. My sister had great results with her boxer pulling her on skates--(use a helmet & guards).

Note on his TV show, there is a frequent disclaimer: ""Do not attempt by yourself, get a professional to help you.""

I totally agree with this--I've seen people totally misinterpret things on their own in totally goofy, usually lazy & self-serving ways and the pet is the ultimate victim.",1146182400,41,1815,4.7215189873417724
2313511,5,B0009RKBGC,"Every dog lover and dog owner should get a copy of this video. Cesar Milan gives the most helpful advice for treating dogs. What he says is common sense that is not so common. It addresses the real issue of dogs in a human world and reveals where some people have gone wrong in their relations with dogs.

The pointers that Cesar gives are easy to follow and any one can use them. And the reality is that the methods work! I have personally seen dramatic changes in the attitudes of some of the dogs that I have tried these methods and philosophy on. It is amazing the see the results so quickly.

The only constructive criticism I have is that the seminar format of the video can be a little hard to watch at times. But the information that Cesar gives more than makes up for that. I would recommend watching some of his programs on television to see more of his philosophy in action and how it can be implemented in your situation with your dog.",1146096000,17,947,4.314606741573034

Also great for those who are not familiar with Cesar Millan and want to try his techniques slowly, or do not have access to his National Geographic Show ""The Dog Whisperer"" on cable.

Further detailed information can be obtained by his obtainingnew book, ""My Way"", reading his blog on the Dog Whisperer website on the National Geographic channel, or joining a group on Yahoo where faster interaction and brainstorming solutions from his book and cds can be found.",1144368000,51,577,4.828282828282828
2313514,2,B0009RKBGC,"I like Cesar's show, and was hoping for something new in this DVD, particularly for $30, but there really wasn't anything new.  While the information was what you hear in the show, it was sketchy, and not enhanced by having him delivering it in a conference room, away from dog examples.  Basically it was Cesar saying what he says in every show, but without the dogs.  I suppose it's a fair summary of his philosophy but that can be reduced to a scant paragraph as others have mentioned -  walk your dog, be first going out the door, etc.  I was just expecting something more or new.  The ""extras"" -- cesar feeding the pack, and the ""pilot"" demo, were very short. And he doesn't feed the whole pack but only a few. I would have liked to see him feed the whole pack successively - we never saw the first dogs get off the table and the others come up and that would have been interesting to see the first give way, etc. (and there were enough dogs there for 3 waves of that). Basically, I think you can get this same info watching any hour show, and you won't see the dogs in this.  but for Cesar fans I suppose it is a must.  I think $15 would have been a fairer price.",1144281600,29,1169,4.1875
2313515,5,B0009RKBGC,"This DVD has been most insightful for me as a long time dog owner.

I started following this sort of psycology with my horses about 10 years ago and was thrilled to see Cesar for the first time on National Geo.

His right-on intuition with dogs has allowed me to see where I need to be in my dogs lives so that they can be balanced individuals.  I am spellbound by his ability to read a dogs body language.  I think the DVD was worth every penny and I will be ordering several more for friends as Christmas gifts.  If we are lucky, maybe a volume II in the future.",1143849600,9,564,4.090909090909091
2313516,5,B0009RKBGC,"Cesar's sense of dog ""logic"" is so well, logical that once you listen to him you realize that what he says is correct in dealing with dogs.  We laugh as we think of them as our ""kids"" but in reality, we are not fulfilling them and their needs as dogs.  I agree that this is a huge issue for most dog owners and it is great to see someone with Cesar's expertise not only tell us bluntly what we are doing to cause unwanted behaviors, but also showing us with simple steps how to correct OURSELVES.  I found this DVD fascinating as I do all his weekly shows.  Can't wait for Season 1 of Dog Whisperer to come out!  Cesar's techniques/knowledge show all dog lovers how to be a dog's best friend.",1143590400,9,692,4.212121212121212
2313517,5,B0009RKBGC,"I think everyone who is willing to listen to the whisper of Cesar can get something valuable out of this video. Not only will his advice prepare you for a better relationship with your dog, It can teach you to become calm and assertive which will improve your life with other humans. People who were not born leaders can become pack leaders. If you incorporate this video with Cesar's ""Dog Whisperer"" series you are likely to learn more because you can see how he applies dog psychology to many different behavior problems. I am currently studying to become a dog obedience trainer, and Cesar is very accurate in what humans need to do for dogs. His discipline does not hurt the dog, and he never advocates causing physical harm. He has a simple formula that anyone young or old can use, but the key is you must use it 100% of the time. As far as the cost, for 45 minutes of video and a few extra clips it is well worth the $30.00. Would you rather pay $10.00 for a video that is essentially worthless?",1142985600,7,1002,4.39247311827957
2313518,2,B0009RKBGC,"I was impressed by what he said and pleasantly surprised, too. I don't get National Geographic channel so I have not seen his show yet. I would have liked to see more interactions with dogs. What I saw was that he had excellent timing and was very sure of what he was looking for from the dog.

He has it right for the most part. ""Calm/Assertive Energy"" is hugely important when handling dogs. I like his emphasis on being aware of the type of emotional energy you put forth and how your dog responds to that.

""Rules, Discipline, and Boundaries"" are so necessary. That cannot be emphasized enough.

I very much like his emphasis on treating the dog as an animal first, then a dog, then a breed, then a name.

The main point he made that I hope he will be able to get ""out there"" is that we have to meet their needs as dogs in order to have a ""balanced"" relationship.

This requires using leadership (teaching them to wait, walk with you, work for their food) and providing them with DAILY outlets for physical and mental stimulation, not just when we feel like it.

He has a beautiful family, is a handsome man and he presents himself well.

One annoying thing was his constant reference to ""dog psychology"" vs. ""human psychology."" This is my personal peeve with him and it's a minor point other than it makes him seem different and more special than other trainers.

There is no new information on this DVD but from reading the other reviews I realize I take it for granted that people already know that dogs are not the same species; that dogs' physical, emotional and social needs must be met; that dogs need guidance as well as affection; and that if the humans are nervous, tentative, rough, or angry, they are not communicating the right message.

What does this remind you of? And why the constant references to being a ""pack?"" Doesn't this describe how a good parent acts? Why not emphasize the relationship as bringing a dog into your human family and home and understanding what it needs as a dog? They have to live in a human world. We don't dig in the dirt and eat garbage.

Apparently many people buy into the idea dogs think we are two-legged dogs and they all live in a pack. If the dog behaves, it must be because it knows you're ""alpha."" Whatever floats your boat. It's kind of silly, really.

I think it would be better to state that humans err when they place human emotions, intentions and thought processes on dogs to a degree that leads to misunderstandings of a dog's nature and misbehavior.

Clearly there is a hierarchy. We control their access to food, water, shelter, reproduction, medical care, access to toys, walks, our attention and affection. We are not competing with them for breeding rights, territory or food. How much more dominant can we really get?

I am bored by the constant references to the pack, dominance and submission - I think they are unnecessary and confusing to people as I notice that people tend to think of dominance as physical dominance and aggression. I wish he would have stated that the way to show dominance is controlling the dog's access to food, water, affection. That key point was missed and too much emphasis was placed on getting the dog to ""submit.""

I think the core issue of leadership with dogs is more a matter of giving the dog what it wants CONTINGENT UPON good behavior. Enough with piling on the template of magical thinking around ""pack"" and ""dominance/submission"" gobbledygook espoused here.

I realize putting that layer on everything is way more sexy than saying, ""hey, stop with inadvertently rewarding bad behavior"" or ""hey, dogs need exercise,"" or ""hey, if you are emotionally out of control your dog will be, too.""

If you buy this video, know that it is not a how-to. It is a lecture on Cesar's training philosophy and an expensive commercial for him...not that there's anything wrong with that. ;-)",1142985600,13,3885,4.625

The 2 dogs I have now are males and even though I thought I was still the alpha after listening to Cesar boy was I wrong! Even though the DVd was not as long as I would have liked it certainly is informative and sheds alot of light on the way dogs minds work. Within just a few weeks of watching this DVD I have again started to walk my bigger dog and now I'm in control and my smaller who barked and growled at eveything that moved is now able to walk by other barking dogs without a care.

However the DVD title is a bit deceiving ""People training"". It will leave you wanting more for your buck. You can get the same for free by watching Cesar's interesting t.v. show. And you will notice that Cesar's arm often appears stressed, pulling the dog backwards. His arm is not relaxed at his side. I am left wondering, who is the boss?

I have migraines. It is a must that I am the boss and my arm be relaxed at my side while my being the alpha and staying in front with my Great Dane pup. With our daily walks, she does not walk in front of me on the leash. And my arm is totally relaxed without stressing my shoulders. I am able to walk her AND my 4 year old retreiver with relaxed arms at my side. Fortunately our whole family participates in training classes with our dogs. They all help exercise the dogs and have play time, too.

The DVD will remind you to stay on top of things. EXERCISE EXERCISE EXERCISE! When you walk or run your dog, stand tall. It feels good. I come home happy after these assertive walks. You and your dogs will love it.

You might become angry with your neighbors who leave their dogs out in the backyard all day long without regular leash walks. Puppies do grow up. And some people don't seem to keep ""the love"" after the infatuated puppy love is gone. Sad!",1139961600,5,1415,4.272388059701493

His work with aggressive,problematic dogs is a miracle to behold! In this video he shows how these ""red zone"" dogs can be rehabilitated and why dog owners need to be the alpha in their own pack. In two days I have witnessed a dramatic change in the behavior of my two aggressive dogs by following Cesar's advice.

Then I realized how much more there was to learn.  So I was thrilled when his DVD ""People Training for Dogs"" was released and couldn't wait for it to arrive.

Since I've taped all his shows, I was glad that this DVD was primarily an hour long lecture on dog psychology.  I was most impressed with the content.  Cesar covers all the key elements we 'humans' need to understand (including the 'why' of it all) in order to become the calm and assertive pack leader that is so crucial in creating that perfect canine/human relationship.

I also like that the DVD contains a Chapter Section, making it quick and easy to review specific segments of information.  And the section on Cesar feeding his 30+ pack of dogs was amazing to say the least.

I can't say enough good things about this DVD.  It contains a wealth of valuable information and insights that every dog owner can benefit from knowing.  I HIGHLY recommend it for every dog owner, but almost more importantly, for every person even contemplating having a dog as part of their household.  This is critical information you need to know and understand so it can be implemented from day one, thus eliminating the potential for bad behaviors to manifest.",1138233600,12,1376,4.640495867768595
2313526,4,B0009RKBGC,"This video takes the principles behind Cesar's philosophy and strategy with dogs and lays it out in black and white. Yes, it is a review of what he talks about in his TV series. (I wouldn't want it any other way.) Its strength is that you don't have to watch 10 hours to get all the information. This video is a concise summary all in one place. It's great for taking some notes and getting things clear in your own mind.

The video uses some of the same footage you see in his TV shows. I think that's good, because for me it reminds me of an example of what he's discussing. If you haven't seen the shows, you wouldn't have that background, but I think you'd still get the picture.

Personally, I have a 6 mo. old black lab cross puppy and have taken him to weekly lessons since we brought him home at 8 weeks. I had to stop walking him because he tore up my elbows so bad (tennis elbow). After watching a marathon of Dog Whisperer episodes over the Christmas holidays, I began walking my dog again, with much greater success even though I can't quite get him to follow me, and have been able to continue daily walks without additional injury to myself. THANK YOU CESAR! In none of the classes I took did we learn, practice, or really even talk about how to walk your dog. This was a topic I knew was extremely important, but it was just assumed that we'd all know how to do it. But I knew I didn't and I didn't know where to get help. This video does give some advice on that, but I do wish it had gone into greater detail.

The only other thing I wish had been covered in more detail (I'm crossing my fingers that it will be part of his new book) is how to get your dog into that calm-submissive state that is so critical to Cesar's methods. My dog tends to be excited and he's got the potential to become dominant if I let him. I'm stressed out, tired, and lacking confidence. Probably not a good combination. However, I'm dedicated to making this work if I can just learn what to do. This video, and Cesar's methods in general, are giving me the confidence I need to control my pup.",1136419200,17,2088,4.215

2313530,4,B0009RKBGC,"No, as another reviewer points out, this is NOT a training video - it's not meant to be! In order to train a dog you first have to understand the nature of dogs and this video does that very well.  Face it folks, dogs are not that complicated, it's the humans that are. There is good, solid, information on this video. You may need to watch it a couple of times to absorb the concepts and incorporate it into your thinking but when you do you will look at dogs for what they are, canines, not furry children.

All of the effective trainers I've been privledged to work with over the years share the same concepts as presented on this DVD. The only production fault is with the lighting, a little too dim in some segments but I was viewing it on my lap top computer screen so a little tweaking with the controls may solve that, even ""as is"" the message still comes though.

This is a nice compliment to Cesar's television program and I'm looking forward to the release of his new book.

I have owned dogs, as an adult, for over 16 years, currently have two Golden Retrievers and a German Shepard mix, in addition to having  fostered a number of Goldens of all ages, gender and temperment.

I've incorporated Cesar's methods into training with my own dogs, as well as rescue dogs and have seen rapid improvement in some otherwise hard to place foster dogs.

This DVD is a good beginning, view other videos, read other books on training but use this as a foundation in all you do with dogs and you will be rewarded for your efforts - it works!!!",1129766400,216,1542,4.370629370629371

The DVD contains a few dog psychology basics, which Cesar fails to back it up with visual examples. A lengthy lecture is all that is provided. I am a visual learner and this DVD might be better suited for auditory learning.",1128384000,12,504,4.674157303370786
2313533,5,B0009RKBGC,"If you're not willing to consider changes in yourself, you're wasting your time --- plus your poor dog's!

For those of you who put up with undesired behavior in your dogs --- ranging from ""kinda irritating"" to down-right dangerous --- because ""I'm afraid he won't love me any more if I try to correct him"", this DVD is for you. It's also for those of you who tried to correct a ""2"" problem (on a scale of 1 to 10), thru error wound up with a ""4"" problem, and decided to learn to live with the ""4"" for fear that your next attempt might result in a ""6"".

Dog psychology/culture is different from what humans have. In order for what you do to have ""meaning"" to the dog, he has to be able to ""relate"" to it. The ""psychology"" Cesar imparts is what is ""hard-wired""/""pre-programmed"" into your dog at conception & reinforced by his mother & littermates during those first critical weeks of life. To try to go against this, rather than learning how to use it to your advantage, just doesn't make good sense.

Learning how a pack functions, & how you can become a calm assertive pack leader, is the cornerstone to all other building blocks between you & your dog. Cesar's basic formula is always ""exercise"", THEN ""discipline"", THEN ""affection"".  Affection when done at a ""wrong"" time can actually nurture the undesired behavior & emotionally unstable mind of the animal at that moment or cause new problems to evolve.

This is best used together with his TV series. You see many dogs in the series & will begin to say ""My dog does that"" or  ""Aaaargh! That's just what I've been doing by mistake!"" But your THOROUGH understanding of ""the system"" will come from this DVD.

We both love it when Cesar gets into ""dog mode"" and demonstrates what the dog is thinking.  This is truly good information that I wish every dog owner knew.  There would be a lot more happy, well balanced dogs and a lot fewer owners with dog problems.  Using Cesar's techniques, my dog Maisey no longer jumps up on visitors and I didn't have to raise my voice or punish her to achieve this.  Thanks Cesar.",1126137600,13,647,4.341666666666667

Now I see what I took for affection from the dogs was actually domination.  I have, unfortunately, had no control over them and need to be more assertive.  Cesar is absolutely right that dogs just know how to be dogs - it's people that need the training. I have taken the dogs to obedience school but some of the methods they teach don't exactly fit with my personality.  I can't wave my arms around and talk in a high pitch voice to get my dogs' attention when they are focused on another dog, a rabbit, a cat, etc.  I've tried and just get strange looks from anyone around (including my dogs), and they just go back to whatever it is they were doing in the first place.

2313547,5,B0009RKBGC,"""People Training For Dogs"" is a `must have' for any dog owner or future dog owner! You owe it to yourself and your dog. Buy this as a present for every dog owner you know!

I have been a follower of Cesar Millan since the very first time I saw `Dog Whisperer'.  There are few people whom I truly respect and admire, and Cesar is at the top of the list.  His contribution to canines and humans can't be measured.

For 14 years I worked as kennel manager at a veterinary college, where I provided all the care for a pack of approximately 65 dogs.  I have a B.S. degree in Animal Science and have had my own dogs for many years.  But even with all of my experience, Cesar showed me aspects of canine versus human behavior I overlooked or just didn't comprehend.

Cesar Millan's approach to understanding dogs and improving the human-dog relationship centers around the need for the dog to view the human as the pack leader, and how all too often the human unknowingly and unintentionally fails (because all we want to do is love, love, love our dogs) in recognizing and meeting the dog's needs to keep them psychologically balanced.  There are no `bad' dogs, only dogs that are in a state of unbalance.  In ""People Training For Dogs"" Cesar explains the factors which play a role in how and why dogs become unbalanced and how dog owners can improve their human-dog relationship.

For those who are familiar with the tv show ""Dog Whisperer"", this dvd portrays a more in depth look into Cesar Millan's philosophy on dog psychology and behavior.  Unlike the tv shows, which show specific cases of dog behavioral problems, this dvd makes you feel as if you are personally involved in attending one of Cesar's seminars and visiting his Dog Psychology Center.

""People Training For Dogs"" delivers a vast amount of enlightening information in a way which is easy to understand and often humorous.  This dvd is for everybody, even those who feel that their dogs are perfect.  You'd be surprised at what you didn't know about dogs!

Cesar, please keep going with all of your efforts!  We all need you!  I'm hoping that your children follow your footsteps and perhaps one of them will open up a Dog Psychology Center in upstate New York!  There are a lot of people here who would line up at your door!",1119571200,49,2287,4.563725490196078

This man is amazing!  He's totally changed our relationship with our 2 dogs and - believe it or not, and I'm sure Cesear would never believe it but - our cat, too!

We are now the happy and proud ""pack leaders"" in our own home and can finally grasp the joy that deeply and naturally bonding with an animal can bring.  We were about to give up on the TV series (how many times can you watch the ""Emily"" episode?) when we learned of the DVD.  It's worth its weight in gold and we have already written the production people asking for another one.

Cesar, keep it up.  You have a God-given gift, and you are NEEDED!  We've noticed that the lucky people you help seem to all be located in sunny Southern California.  Well, those of us in rural New Hampshire have some of the same problems, too! If you want to come here, I promise you, we can find you some very needy dogs and owners who will be positive examples for your future DVD's or TV shows.

I've taken many dog-training, canine ethology courses in my life with dogs and have learned much from all of them but when I recently adopted a Papillion that was a hour away from being put down for being ""vicious"", it was the techniques that I learned from Cesar that allowed me to turn her around and transform her into a very nice family dog.

Dogs are easy but people are hard. Cesar has really clued into this.  Thank you, Cesar!",1118534400,6,448,4.439024390243903
2313551,5,B0009RKBGC,"I had the great privilege of having a one-on-one consultation with Cesar at his Dog Psychology Center in May 2005 (without my dogs, which were on the ""right coast.""), then attended his seminar the next day. I was so taken with his approach that I flew from PA to CA just to meet with him, see his center and attend the seminar. For any of you skeptics out there--Cesar has a true and unique gift.  He is exactly the same in person as he is in front of the camera...a consistent, calm, assertive individual whose mission in life is to train people to allow their dogs to lead fulfilled ""doggy"" lives.  Despite his fame and reputation, he does not deviate from who he is and what his message is.

The DVD is a companion piece to his TV show.  The show provides the actual work examples; the DVD is his philosophy with a few snippets from his show.  Like others, I hope he does another DVD with more of his direct work with dogs and their people--or I hope we can eventually have the entire series available for purchase on DVD.  It would make a great packaged set!  (how about Christmas time, Cesar and Illusion?)

If you have been anthropomorphosizing your dogs, you may find his approach hard to understand. But stick with it...watch this DVD and the National Geographic channel ""Dog Whisperer"" shows and you will eventually become a convert.",1118188800,8,1342,4.539419087136929
2313552,5,B0009RKBGC,"I implemented Cesar's recommendations from the video and they made a difference in my dog's behavior on the very first day!  It is such a simple concept but truely amazing.  My little boy dog (from the animal shelter) was showing aggressive behavior.  I started the training, that Cesar highlights in the video, on a daily basis and after that my dog became submissive and calm.  I have been walking my three dogs every day since and have been practicing being the calm assertive leader with them.  I hope many dog owners purchase your video, so many dogs and humans could become happier together!",1118016000,5,597,4.757281553398058

Training people to understand how dogs think makes training more efficient and a happier home for all dogs and people. I recommend this DVD as one of the best in training people. I learned in all the many dog training classes I took, that the hardest part was training me, the owner. Once you start looking at how the dog thinks, then training accordingly, and training the owner to be consistent in dog language. All goes very well. The best.",1117929600,7,611,4.666666666666667

Cesar Millan has a gentle way with both the dog owners and their dogs and a profound understanding of both.  I have bumbled my way through advising people; I am not a trainer.  No more bumbling now, though.  This DVD is a gem and no dog owner or lover should be without it.  Mr. Millan explains and demonstrates in a way that anyone can listen and have it make sense.  The result will be less dogs being surrendered and much happier families.  This DVD is a KEEPER.",1117670400,8,629,4.218487394957983

This DVD says all the right things, in a way that every owner can understand, and shows how a good leader shows authority in an assertive, but nonviolent way.  I'm going to make this required viewing for all my clients!
Cesar, thank you for taking the time to share such magnificent information with the World.",1117670400,11,529,4.627659574468085

2313557,5,B0009RKBGC,"The title says it all. Mr. Millan's ""new"" method of dog training may be the start of revolution of K9 education for many of us ""loving"" dog owners.

I am as guilty as the next person poor dog ""care""-but was very fortunate in watching Mr. Millan's ""Dog Whisper"" TV program on National Geographic just about the same time as I received a Golden Retriever as a pet. I don't know who was luckier at my ""tv viewing"" find...the dog or me.

Since then I have attended Mr. Millan's Seminar's as well as purchased this DVD. His teachings are without a doubt-something the dog and you will benefit from learning for a life time working relationship filled with respect and dependability.

If you are searching for ""something"" to guide you through-training your dog, such as ""house breaking your puppy"" or ""How to slow down your hyperactive barking beast down before the neghborhood holds a meeting to tell you how rotten of a dog you own-and yet-they think your a really swell Dad"".. THIS DVD should be your very first corrective step. I promise-you will not be disappointed. I ask you-have I ever lied to you ever before?

Why would I start now?

(It works on barky or snarling bosses as well-if you give it a chance. I am serious. Give it a try)",1117497600,7,1237,4.554054054054054

It is a very informative, useful, and enjoyable video!  I have been enthusiastically sharing info about Cesar and his behavioral tips with family, co-workers, and friends because it makes so much sense and is easy to understand and implement! I showed some dog owners an example of what I was learning and their dogs responded positively right then and there!!  It works so fast. I really enjoy the wisdom Cesar is sharing with all of us!  He is doing everyone a great service by giving us tools to use to have happy dogs, dog owners and non-dog owners!  I really appreciate his gifts to our community and the world!!!

His methods are simple but very effective, and this DVD lays it all out for you in an entertaining way.

2313560,5,B0009RKBGC,"I have been watching Cesar Millan's television program for a few months now and was delighted to see that he had come out with a DVD, which I bought as soon as I knew about it. When I first started watching Cesar, I didn't like some of the things he said because I had so humanized my dog, I treated him like a 4-legged child. I couldn't argue with Cesar's dramatic results, though - often seeing years'-long behavior problems eliminated within the course of one session with Cesar. Gradually, my mindset began to shift, and I came to realize that understanding dogs AS THEY ARE was the best gift I could give to my own dog, Connor. I've come to respect Connor's ""dog-ness"" instead of seeing him through the eyes of human psychology. I am now happy to report that, just by implementing what I've learned from Cesar, my 3-yr-old American Pit Bull Terrier, who had become increasingly dog-aggressive, now goes to local dog parks and plays happily with other dogs! I can't recommend this DVD highly enough. To anyone who has trouble with the message (which is clearly and logically presented), I would say give it a chance, and give it some time! You may be surprised to find that your own way of perceiving dogs will shift.",1117152000,15,1221,4.579908675799087

This amazing DVD has taught our volunteers how to properly relate to our rescue dogs.  As a result, our adoptions have soared, and many of the dogs we thought couldn't be placed in homes have become balanced and socialized!  After faithfully watching every episode of ""The Dog Whisperer,"" I was frustrated trying to explain Cesar's philosophy to others.  Now I just tell them to purchase the DVD! Thank you Cesar for helping us save so many lives!",1117152000,12,541,4.73404255319149

Surely, all of the pointers he gives in this dvd would be better illustrated via demonstration than just talk.

I use Cesar's work to illustrate a basic principle to my students - our understanding of how others perceive us and the world around them is important. Cesar truly is a dog psychologist - he understands how they think and what they need. There are a lot of dog training books and DVDs that fail to use this very basic principle. Using his techniques will absolutely put a stop to dog behavior problems and help people keep their ""problem"" dogs.

Thanks, Cesar - you're the pack leader!",1117065600,,347,4.8
2313566,5,B0009RKBGC,"When I got Johnnie (a yellow lab), my very first dog (I've wanted one for years)I admit I was one of those dog owners who let him run the show.  The result - he jumped all over my friends, destroyed my living room, and was generally hyperactive all the time.  I figured I'd just gotten an out of control dog.  I had no idea it was me causing the behaviors.

Cesar Millan's TV show opened my eyes to what I was doing wrong and I began to try some of his methods.  Once I started acting as Johnnie's ""pack leader,"" I saw the most amazing results instantly.  I bought this DVD from Cesar's website two weeks ago - he explains everything so clearly and in so much more depth than in the series.  Honestly, my friends can't believe Johnnie is the same dog.  And I honestly believe Johnnie is happier - he's calmer, more even-tempered, and has so far not destroyed the new furniture I had to buy because of the old Johnnie.

If you are like me and love your dog but not his behavior, then RUN DON'T WALK to buy this DVD!  Cesar, you are my hero!",1117065600,10,1039,4.175879396984925
2313567,5,B0009RKBGC,"I always watch the Dog Whisperer on NG (even reruns) and immediately watched his DVD when I got it.  To watch Cesar and his knkowledge in his way with dogs is mesmorizing and opened my eyes more to my flaws in the way I've treated my animals like babies.  I knew this already from watching his shows but it really hit home with the information on his DVD. Don't expect any one-on-one cases with this DVD, it is in a seminar format from him, with flashbacks on some of the cases he has had on his show. But it packs alot of eye-opening information!!  Calm-assertive energy is a must for someone who wants to be the pack leader - this is something I definitely have to dig deep and work on.  First exercise, then discipline, and then affection - are his 3-finger rules. I actually managed to teach my 7 year old shih tzu to wear a collar and walk on a leash by watching one of his shows.  That just tickled me pink!  If you get the DVD and don't think it is worth it's weight in gold, then you don't have your furbabies foremost in your mind.  It requires ""work"" and ""sacrifices"" from those that love their animals.  Cesar is truly one-of-a-kind person with a mystic command.",1117065600,6,1173,4.324200913242009

Cesar explained why and it makes perfect sense. I highly recommend this DVD. It has helped my family in many ways. Cesar is the true dog lover and leader.

Cesar was recommended to us several months ago and we began watching his TV series on the National Geographic Channel.  It was a revelation. We have since recommended his show to all of our dog-owning friends and family.

We've learned the power of calm assertive energy and how to be the pack leader when we go for walks. (btw, we do a lot more walking these days) Cesar's message is simple yet very effective.

2313571,5,B0009RKBGC,"Any one can relate.......

I have recently watched the new DVD, by Cesar Millan, People Training for Dogs.

Cesar tells it like it is, in a very tactful and truthful way. WE ARE THE PROBLEM, no two ways about it.

I am a Veterinary assistant, and you can not imagine how many people come in and blame the dog...After listening to them and looking at the dog, you know what the problem is, the owner....

I believe that anyone who has owned a dog can relate to what Cesar is saying and laugh to themselves about the mistakes we have made in the past and how lost we felt that we could not correct our problem dog.

Watching this DVD, Cesar shows his very caring and compassionate side, letting us see; all dogs need us to be the pack leader to show them the way to live in harmony with in our families, which they, (the dog), must think is very strange.

Consistency is the message here. You have to see the DVD to get to know how truly great and intelligent Cesar is.

I want to get the message of Cesar Millan to all the people who want to adopt a dog, and dog owners to improve their relationship with their dogs.

Watch Cesar and you will open up a new world for you and your dog, to be happy and stable. (Emphasis on stable.)

Cesar is truly a dog behavior expert which is shown in every way on his show the Dog Whisperer, and on his new DVD...
