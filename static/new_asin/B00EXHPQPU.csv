8610188,3,B00EXHPQPU,"Armour of God has been billed as 'Operation Condor 2' even though it was released years prior to Operation Condor. It might make more sense to look at Armour of God as more of a prequel to Operation Condor, as Chan essentially does play the same character in both films. The biggest problem with this movie is that there really isn't very many action scenes in it.

Especially if you compare it to Operation Condor, which is one of the most action packed Jackie Chan movies ever made. Besides the car chase, the only other really noteworthy action scene comes at the very end of the movie, which didn't have the best acting, story or dialogue to begin with. If you are a die hard Jackie Chan fan you will like this movie, even though it certainly isn't one of his best, otherwise it's a passable action flick.",1401062400,2,809,4.466216216216216
