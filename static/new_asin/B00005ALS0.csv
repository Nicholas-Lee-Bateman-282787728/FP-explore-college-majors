1413826,5,B00005ALS0,"As a ""dog show person"" I wasn't sure what to expect!! Would I be offended?  Would it make fun of ""us""?  You bet it did, and I loved every minute of it!! I saw it with another dog show friend and we were laughing more than anyone in the theater.  You have to enjoy off beat humor, which we do.  The funniest movie I have seen in a long, long time.  The buzz in the real dog show world is that most people loved it!",981676800,5,413,3.8117647058823527
1413827,5,B00005ALS0,"Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy are masters of subtle humor.  Their movies do not have the in-your-face/big puchline type jokes.  This is why their movies are generally released to ""Art Houses"" rather than the Hollywood Colossal-Plex theaters.  Best in Show is the latest installment in the ""mockumentary"" genre created by Guest.  Best in Show is more like Waiting for Guffman than This is Spinal Tap.  Like Guffman, Best in Show introduces the characters one-by-one during Act I.  You learn that each character has his own flaw (or flaws), and each has a quirky history.  What I love about the characters in Guest/Levy's films is that great care is gone in to creating them.  There are no ""throw away"" characters.  It's obvious that these guys love the roles they created.  I loved Spinal Tap and Guffman and this film fits in the genre beautifully.  I wouldn't say that this humor is for everyone.  This is very much unlike ""Ace Ventura"" or ""Scary Movie.""  Jokes develop slowly but have big yet subtle pay-offs.  I eagerly await the DVD and Guest/Levy's next installment!",978912000,4,1075,4.9
1413828,4,B00005ALS0,"Eugene Levy and Christopher Guest have pulled off another great ""mockumentary"" surrounding the owners of show-dogs as they compete in what appears to be the superbowl of Dog Shows.

Following a series off characters, all of whom are odd in some way, makes for great entertainment.  The low-budget nature of the film adds to its realistic hilarity, though at times the humour is a bit over-the-top.  I found myself laughing frequently at this film, enjoying the strange and eccentric people that continually parade across the screen - and that doesn't even take into account the dogs!  Which reminds me - if you love dogs, as I do, then you will enjoy the many and varied canines that are on display here.

I particularly commend Levy as an awkward, sensitive man with two left feet - literally.  His constant demeanor of confusion and caring is hilarious and highlights Levy's comedic abilities that have made me laugh for 15 years since SCTV reruns where on TV.

I was also surprised and delighted by Fred Willard's absolutely hilarious role as the half-witted, over-talkative and misinformed announcer for the dog show.  His antics were brilliantly pulled off and were the source of a great deal of my laughter.

This movie in style, comedy and even characters is little different from Waiting for Guffman (I have not seen This is Spinal Tap), so if you did not like Guffman's brand of humour, you will want to avoid this.

Otherwise, sit back and enjoy!",976752000,3,1456,4.834677419354839
1413829,4,B00005ALS0,"I went to my local theater last night and found that, unless I wanted to wait another hour, I only had two options: BEST IN SHOW or a film about little kids during the Holocaust.  After reading the dreary synopsis of the Holocaust movie, I needed a laugh so BEST IN SHOW won out by default.  I had heard a couple of glowing reviews so I anticipated laughing 'til I peed my pants.
  The best I can say about this film is that it is relatively entertaining (in a way I hadn't expected), but chockful of big yuks it's not.  In fact, I can recall only a half-dozen or so decent laughs.  None of it came close to leaving me rolling in the aisle.  Christopher Guest's satirical humor appears to be one of those acquired tastes that makes only certain people roar with laughter and is definitely NOT what most folks think of as situational comedy.
  Guest's film is an ersatz documentary that focuses primarily on several hopeful dog owners who have entered their prize-winning purebreds in The Mayflower, a fictional granddaddy of all dog shows held in Philadelphia.  The featured contenders run the gamut:
There's a wealthy, foppish gay couple and one of their two Shih Tzus.
  There's a heavily made-up gold-digger and her butch poodle handler (the gold-digger's first interview is the funniest part of the whole movie).
Parker Posey is fantastic as the ""better"" half of an ill-matched wannabe yuppie couple with major Type-A personalities and a Weimaraner that harbors dubious hostility toward her owners' equally dubious sexual escapades.
Another team is comprised of a hopeless geek, his blowsy wife (a formerly libidinous former barfly played by the amazing Catherine O'Hara) and a terrier from suburban Florida.
And, finally, there's a gentle yokel from the South (played endearingly by Guest himself) and his beautiful bloodhound.
Throw in the dog show organizer, the hotel manager (Ed Begley, who did an excellent job with a small role) and a stupid, annoying, loudmouth color commentator (played by Fred Willard) and you've pretty much got the cast. According to Roger Ebert, Willard ""steals the show.""  He did no such thing.  In fact, he's the main reason NOT to watch this movie.  He was the polar opposite of funny.  ""Corny"" is about generous as I can be.
With that notable exception aside, what BEST IN SHOW lacks in laughs is more than made up for by the characterizations impressively fleshed out by Guest and his stars.  The rabid regulars on the dog show circuit were entirely believable, particularly with regard to the naivete of their dialogue and their interaction among friends, family and the competition.
At times, the whole scenario was reminiscent of the cheap notoriety and common vulgarity that pervades those behind-the-scenes looks at little girls' beauty pageants, replete with stressed out stage moms and the self-imposed pre-show pressure that verges on abuse.  It was this aspect of the film -- the big fish in a little pond -- that earned my conditional respect.
The dry wit of BEST IN SHOW is often mildly amusing, but it's inconsistent and that left quite a few boring, sometimes annoying, lulls in my interest.  Contrarily, this movie surprises with other mostly positive attributes that a select audience might find appealing enough to make it worth renting.",974764800,3,3292,4.931159420289855
1413830,5,B00005ALS0,"I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive when I went to see ""Best In Show"".  After the first 10 minutes, I realized that I was in for a great ride.  I won't go into details (you can read Tom Reynolds review above for the plot), but I will say that this is one of the funniest movies I've seen a some time.  The characters are funny yet strangely believable.  I personally found Fred Willard's character a laugh riot.  It's one of those movies where you find yourself repeating funny lines from the movie for days.  See it before it leaves the theaters; you won't regret it!",974678400,2,581,4.284403669724771
1413831,5,B00005ALS0,"If you saw Spinal Tap you know what Christopher Guest is capable of as far as so true, yet so ""out there"" pseudo Documentary. Best In Show is of the same calibre, the addition of Eugene Levy, and a great supporting cast of seasoned actors and actresses makes this only the more enjoyable movie, we enjoyed this movie and received the best ""belly laughs"" in a long while. So grab your popcorn and grab your favorite canine and watch and enjoy this work of comedic genius!.",972777600,,471,4.488372093023256
1413832,4,B00005ALS0,"Writer/director Christopher Guest takes a look at the relationship between Man and that most loyal of beasts, the dog, in ""Best In Show,"" a humorous satire presented in the same ""mock documentary"" style as Rob Reiner's ""This Is Spinal Tap.""  It's a keen observation of human nature, as it is much more about the owners and handlers than about the dogs themselves, and much as David Byrne did with ""True Stories,"" Guest presents a diverse community united by a single, common thread, that being their love for their dogs, and aspirations of winning the blue ribbon in the upcoming competition that will go to the top dog overall, the Best In Show.  Through a series of interviews and memorable scenes, we are introduced to the owners and their beloved canines who will soon square off in the arena at the world class Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia.  We get to know a bit about each of the participants, so we know just who they are and where they come from.  Guest has assembled a terrific ensemble cast, who bring it all to life by creating a rich tapestry of characters culled from a true cross section of Americana:  Good ol' boy Harlan Pepper (Guest), with his Bloodhound, ""Hubert"", from Pine Nut, North Carolina; a somewhat neurotic young couple from Illinois, Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock), members of the ""Starbucks"" set with their Weimaraner, ""Beatrice;"" Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara), a couple who could be anybody's next door neighbors, with their Norwich Terrier, ""Winky"", from Fern City, Florida;  Leslie and Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw and Jennifer Coolidge) a wealthy couple who have a Standard Poodle, ""Rhapsody In White"", entrusted to the care of professional handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch); and finally, another couple, Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean), with their precious Shih Tzus, ""Miss Agnes.""  This is a highly entertaining, funny movie, filled with wry, subtle humor that is delivered straight and never played for laughs, which makes it believable and real, and all the more hilarious.  This is quite a group of characters, eclectic to say the least, and they're all real people.  You're bound to run into someone you know among them.  The dialogue is sharp, and rife with dry wit.  And for anyone who's ever watched any kind of sporting event on television, you'll appreciate the parody of the so-called ""color commentator,"" in this case a guy named Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), that is dead on the money.  His comments during an interview to a nonplused Dr. Millbank (Bob Balaban) about Columbus landing at Plymouth Rock will have you on the floor.  There is so much here you can relate to, and it's all done in such good fun.  Rounding out the outstanding supporting cast are Don Lake (Graham Chissolm), Jim Piddock (Trevor Beckwith), Ed Begley, Jr. (Hotel manager), Linda Kash (Fay Berman), Larry Miller (Max Berman) and Don S. Davis (Best In Show Judge).  The performances here are good all around, with especially notable turns by O'Hara, Levy, Guest, Lynch and Willard.  Written by Guest and Levy, ""Best In Show"" works so well because it holds up a mirror and reflects the lives we all lead in one way or another.  As we watch, we realize that even as we are laughing at all of these characters and situations, at the same time we're laughing at ourselves as well; because there's more than a little bit of each one of us in there somewhere.  And it reminds us that when things seem to be getting too serious, it's time to pick up that mirror and take a good look; and thanks to the frame of reference that a movie like this provides, you just may find something to laugh about, and be able to discover the ""Best In Show"" in your own life.",972345600,7,3794,4.792944785276074

I found the first half of the movie, very boring, but to give the mokumentary credit it does improve once the owners reach the hotel.

I find many of the scenes and the various 'characters' in the film to be formulaic and cliche.  The gay couple was great, with each half of the couple being a great character in their own way.  But as for the rest of the dog owner characters, they were pretty one-dimensional and their 'quirks' pretty predictable and not that outstanding.  I actually found Parker Posey's character to be rather poorly fleshed-out (and typicallly I love Parker Posey...)",1483228800,,595,4.794117647058823

(The dogs themselves are beautiful, and treated respectfully by the director, Christopher Guest, who also happens to play a dog owner with ventriloquism skills.) A word of advice: this is the kind of movie where you need to sit down and pay all your attention to the dialog. Watch for the way the hostage negotiator deals with his son refusing to come down from a tree, and look for the ongoing cheeky/ random comments by a dog show commentator (Fred Willard), endured by his long-suffering British counterpoint (Jim Piddock).",1483142400,2,674,4.9734513274336285

I bought two DVD copies of this movie, lent them out over the years, and of course, couldn't convince my friends to return them....so now I will have to come back to Amazon and stop renting and buy my own copy...

Whether you think dogs are nutty and that their owners can be nutty, if you think dog shows are a circus of nuttiness, or if you love nutty people, nutty dogs and are a fan of dog shows, either way, you will love this movie....

You will also enjoy seeing some comedians you haven't seen in a while,  Jane Lynch way back before her huge presence on the TV and movie screens and some comedians you can't get enough of (all of this cast),

That only tells me that people who don't find it at all funny probably laugh at things that I would not like - it takes all kinds, and thank goodness for diversity. What I like most about this is that, to me, the dialog seems less scripted than spontaneously improvised, and that most of the funniest things are presented as not funny at all - such as Harlan's very serious musings about nuts ... reminded me SO much of my dad lecturing me about the fine points of his favorite camera for no reason at all. Years ago I had a friend who had no sense of humor but was the funniest person I ever met just because she never said anything that was intended to be funny - like when we got a Danish guy joined our car-pool and she asked him ""Do they have dogs in Denmark?"" or asking a mutual friend from England how she came to the states by asking ""Did you fly or drive?""

The cast manages to capture several major stereotypes of dog owners very well and actually make you believe that it could be real.

No popcorn or soda, but a continual sense of slack-jawed amazement over the astonishingly vivid and crazily accurate portrayals of all the characters who, in their insanely interwoven and simultaneously separate lives, do improbable things with improbable animals to win a bit of ribbon (and a somewhat larger bit of international renown).

1414797,5,B00005ALS0,"""Best in Show"" has an honored place in my DVD cabinet, along with ""Waiting for Guffman"", early Woody Allen comedies, and Wes Anderson's ""The Royal Tannenbaums"".  I guess I've given myself away here; I'm not a hit-you-over-head comedy lover, although I loved Lucille Ball (another comedic genius) -- but you could definitely appreciate ""The Forty-Year-Old Virgin"" and still enjoy ""Best in Show"", or any of Guest's brilliant comedies.  ""Best in Show"" is done in Guest's signature mockumentary style, reminiscent of Woody Allen's early comedies (""Take the Money and Run"", ""Zelig""), but Guest puts his own mark on this style and makes it his own.  His casting, as usual, is impeccable, and many of my favorites from ""Waiting for Guffman"" are here: Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy, playing a down-on-their-luck couple obsessed with their terrier; Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock as a totally strung-out lawyer couple whose Weimaraner takes on their own angst; Jennifer Coolidge as an Anna Nicole Smith-type dog owner who hires Jane Lynch as her dog's trainer and sparks fly; John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean as a flamboyantly gay couple with a shih-tzu; and of course, Bob Balaban and Fred Willard.  All are absolutely brilliant and their improvisation beyond compare.  I tire of Fred Willard a little bit when I re-watch this, as I do about once a year.  That is about the only criticism I can give, and it isn't really a criticism, because I howled with laughter the first few times.  The bizarro world of dog showing and dog competitions is what the plot revolves around, but it so much more than that.  Buy it along with ""Waiting for Guffman"" and sit back and prepare to be hilariously entertained.",1468800000,,1708,4.98943661971831

This is an older movie so renting on redbox was not an option. This movie has that strange humor to it and depicts the dog show world as slighty strange and wacky. However, the dog show world is slightly strange and wacky. Everyone has their own quarks to them, while not as extreme as in this movie, it is funny how close they were. I thought it was hilarious.

The primary issue is for persons to have extremely knowledgeable judges compare their dogs to the standard of the breed)  but the writers/director for this  movie either have shown dogs, or spent time checking out shows, because they've  presented a pretty accurate cross section of people who do show !",1424476800,,546,4.827956989247312

1415591,5,B00005ALS0,"Fred Willard and Parker Posey steal the show on this one but there are plenty of strong performances but the ensemble cast.

I found this movie really does pick up toward the back end when Willards character is introduced and found the entire dog show hilarious due to his constant input and interaction with the other announcer. The Sherlock Holmes dog  / You did that joke last year it is just hit line after hit line and he just plays the role perfectly.

Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara have a great dynamic here mostly due to the running gag of past indiscretions that are bought to the surface but O'Hara ex lovers and the hilarious manner in which pops up a lot.

Parker Posey has some great scenes most notably when looking for busy bee and delivers one of the best screaming walk off lines perfectly whilst the next interaction in the pet store is priceless.

The same type of humour you have come to expect in this style of mockumentry and if you like this style it is one of their best which starts a little slow but really picks up speed at the end of the film. Hard to pick between this one and Waiting for Guffman they are both brilliant in their own right.",1422921600,2,1172,4.382488479262673

Why those neurotic people wound up with a Weimeraner, a difficult dog to figure out, is too weird. Love the guy with two left feet, literally. The guy with the beautiful Bloodhound is too funny. The Shit-zhu loving couple ( gay) are way over the top. And the Poodle owners and their handler take dog-showing to the limit. Of the two commentators, one of them can barely control his desire to send the other one ""to the moon"". This is a perfect mockumentary using real people in a real situation with actors taking over the scenario to make it less than believable, but way too funny.",1411171200,,720,4.380597014925373

After all..., that blue piece of velvet material fashioned in a big bow, is worth it. Is it not? The show dogs that were registered for the contest, definitely don't know the difference. Because all they seem to care about, is the free room-n-board, complimentary hair-care and grooming, doggie spa baths complete with four-legged pedicures, individual attention and biscuits a plenty. And, for this  ""...hope to win..."" Doggie-Distinction Award along with the big, gold-colored, Awards Cup, a slightly moronic Florida couple whose credit cards are totally worthless, having travelled all the way up North for their adorable pooch to be apart of this prestigious Competition, allow themselves to be housed within a hotel, custodial, chemical closet. Obviously, they LOVE their pooch. Next, comes the lesbian couple wherein the woman who dresses, looks and acts like a man, comes out-of-the-closet and publicly in a television interview, surprise, surprise... ""discloses"", that she is the disciplinarian complete with spankings, for both women and dogs. These two characters are followed by a homosexual couple, one of whom decided to start redecorating the hotel room that they were staying in and almost misses the Dog Show Competition, because out of several suitcases full of clothing, he can't decide what to wear!? But, no need to fear, his lover ""Daddy"", managed to get him dressed and there, just in time. These obvious, neurotic, group therapy, candidates..., are followed and up-staged by two absolutely psychotic and probably bipolar, so-called attorneys, who evidently suffer from acute anxiety attacks who met and married over their shared love of their coffee lattes. In addition too, their being ""law-suit happy"" over their dog's 'Busy-Bee', chew toy. Also, neither of them can stand people in general or the clients that they represent, so they found their way around having to deal with mankind by conveniently ordering through catalogs. And, too top it all off, they are firm believer's that 'Psychiatry for their Dog', is where it's at! And, oh yes, last but not least..., the two mismatched, Doggie Show Commentators: One of which is a bonafide idiot whose in love with himself, the sound of his own voice, his 'off the wall opinions' and doesn't know when to shut up. And the other distinct moron, a so-called, grown man, who doesn't have the gut's to tell him, ""...to put a lid on it!"" All of it!! So, who wins the big, blue, velvet, bow-tie and big, gold-colored, metal, Doggie Cup Award? Watch and see, and laugh all the way, around. This really is, in every sense of the word: A very funny, furry and cuddly, comedy. So, pop the popcorn and enjoy! :) Nina Kish",1407283200,,2893,5.090526315789473

Every character in this film is fully realized: they are delightfully eccentric dog trainers who manage to seem both bizarre and familiar. I'd be willing to watch an entire film centered around any one of these characters. The actors are so damn good at creating their quirky personae that you may will likely cringe at how real they seem. A must-watch for any budding comedy junkie.,1402876800,,482,5.113924050632911

Since my local video store caters heavily to Hollywood blockbuster crap I had to buy the DVD to satisfy my annual jones for this flick.  Not really a film to appeal to the average viewer, this is more for people who appreciate off the wall humor.  Anyone who has ever attended a dog show might appreciate it and people who have been involved with showing dogs should find it amusing.

As far as I am concerned, this satirical look behind the scene of this fictional event is well crafted, well acted and extremely funny.

1416132,5,B00005ALS0,"Best In Show is one of my favorite movies.  Great acting, adorable dogs and a hilarious depiction of what dog shows (and horse show) can be like. I could watch it 20 times and still be forced to laugh out loud :-).",1393200000,,214,4.095238095238095

1416146,4,B00005ALS0,"Best In Show is one of those films that I enjoy watching a half-dozen times. Centered around a most prestigious pure-bred dog show, there are five very distinct owners with five very distinct canines.  Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are the main story line - Catherine's promiscuous past coming up constantly to the consternation of Levy's ultimate geek character. The other contenders are an affluent gay couple, a Southern fishing shop owner (with his trusty Bloodhound), a busty trophy wife (continuously sought after by her lesbian dog trainer) married to a much-senior husband and lastly, a yuppie self-absorbed couple always on the verge of anxiety attacks.  There's enough quirkiness and funny lines for everyone, including Fred Willard's show announcer crazy statements and questions of the staid British color commentator.  If you're a dog lover, it's even better.  Enjoy, relax and laugh.",1392768000,,900,5.361702127659575
1416147,4,B00005ALS0,"An average of 3.5, so I'll round up. This movie is hysterically funny. It never seems to get old. I would say the cast is full of some of the best improv comedy actors around. Great, great movie.

The quality of this Blu Ray, however, does not cut it. I'd recommend buying the DVD because this did not translate well to HD video.",1392768000,,329,4.222222222222222

1416149,4,B00005ALS0,I first purchased this film on VHS and have now worn out the tape.  Best in Show has an all star comedy cast that will leave you laughing the whole way through.,1392768000,,160,4.0

1416151,3,B00005ALS0,Funny but bad acting. Dogs were perfect of course. Story line was really cute and these handlers do go a bit overboard in real life.,1392681600,,132,4.32
1416152,5,B00005ALS0,"If u need a good laugh then this is your movie. My wife have seen this movie with friends and just us and we always find something funny every time we missed the times before. there are several scenes that cause bust-out laughs.

1416165,5,B00005ALS0,"This movie takes a group of extreme dogs enthusiasts and put them/their dogs in the biggest dog show competition. The relationships between dogs/owners and the narration of Fred Willard as the competition's ""color"" commentator are hilarious.

1416166,5,B00005ALS0,One of our family's favorites. Watched by us many times and just as funny each time we watch it. If you love dogs this is definitely a must watch.,1392595200,,146,4.068965517241379

1416170,2,B00005ALS0,"We stopped watching about half way.  It just made no sense.  There were a few funny parts, but overall it was just dumb.  However, humor is a subjective thing, you might like it.",1392422400,,178,4.333333333333333
1416171,5,B00005ALS0,Movie was very funny and enjoyable for entire family.  Reminded us of the old Vacation and Caddy Shack comedies.  A great satire of the Dog Show scene.,1392422400,,151,4.555555555555555
1416172,5,B00005ALS0,"I love this movie and it gets funnier with each watching, though that's my quirky sense of humor.  It's a mock documentary with some over the top stereotyping, but nothing too hurtful.",1392422400,,184,4.75
1416173,4,B00005ALS0,Could watch this movie over and over. The best part about Christopher Guest is while he's having fun with the subject matter you could tell he also has great affection for those he lampoons.,1392422400,,190,4.617647058823529
1416184,5,B00005ALS0,"One of funniest movies ever.  Eugene Levy, Parker Posey et. al are hysterical in this Christopher guest movie.  I've seen it several times.  It's especially fun to watch after seeing the Westminster Dog Show on tv.",1392336000,,214,4.888888888888889
1416185,5,B00005ALS0,"If you have ever watched dog shows and loved the dogs but found the people hysterically amusing, you'll love this movie.

1416188,1,B00005ALS0,"I was disappointed in this comedy.  I watched it till the end thinking, this has got to get better, but it never did.  It especially got worse the more I watched it.  I get enough of the gay life style on the box we use to call TV.,  should now be called our brain washing machine.  I'm not a hateful person, I just don't agree with showing the affections of same sex partners in any capacity to the young. We should clean up the airways between man and women, men and men, women and women, all of it has gone way beyond disgusting.",1392249600,,532,4.12621359223301
1416189,3,B00005ALS0,"It has its funny moments but in the end is very strange, almost like weird situational humor. I ended up playing on my phone through part of it.

1416190,4,B00005ALS0,"This, in my opinion, is the best offering from Christopher Guest & Co. Understated humor, great characters. The actors are at their best in this spoof, each of them in the best role to showcase his or her talents. The Parker Posey-Michael Hitchcock scenes can be a little grating, as they shout a lot, but it makes the end payoff that much funnier. The movie has enough layers warrant multiple viewings. Good stuff!",1392163200,,415,4.698630136986301

Nor is it your raunchy Hangover/American Pie type of comedy either.  The comedic style of Christopher Guest is almost subtle--I don't think he was going for knee slapping funny (although there are definitely scenes where I was laughing a good while!).  I saw one review that said the announcer was too obnoxious--have you ever seen a dog show before!? This is a satirical take on dog shows by showing the almost extreme sides of humans (foils of the 2 gay guys and Jerry/Cookie--loved it)....and I loved how each dog mirrored their owners' personality.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.  If you're wondering what you'll be getting into...this type of comedy falls along the lines of The Office with the mockumentary style and the awkward, sometimes cringe-worthy humor and downright human moments.",1391558400,,986,4.975609756097561

Naturally there are many styles of humor. Example, many people in the US have trouble following British humor and vice-versa. Some humor is broad slapstick, others narrow genre.

This show is very much the latter, narrow genre, stylized to specific tastes. As such, it will be hugely loved by some viewers and complete waste of time for others (as it was for me).

I learned however a great tip from this experience. Look up the most positive reviewers of a show, see what other shows those people like. If you share similar tastes, go for it. Otherwise don't.

If I'd crosschecked for similar tastes to fans of this show, I would have known to avoid it.  :-)",1383436800,,768,4.457142857142857

I think I enjoy most the culture commentary that is a running subtext regarding gold diggers, rednecks and others.

It seemed like the characters were written by mean spirited children showing us how smart they are through the idiocy of the characters they dreamed up.

Well, there are some resemblances in this film.  Some of the dialogue is improvised.  It's quite amusing at times, but it helps to love dogs and put up with their owners. The owners are fairly neurotic - the dogs seem smarter.  Lots of goofy humor about dogs and their owners.

1416686,1,B00005ALS0,"I am stupefied, and perplexed, and also befuddled at the number of excellent reviews regarding Best in Show. Perhaps one must be ""in on the joke"" or stoned or a good friend of Larry Miller's to see in this film what I simply can't. This film starts out slow and gets slower real quick. This type of humor is a kind of esoteric, insider let's-say-every-word-with-exaggerated-obviousness funny, or at least the actors and the director seem to think so. It's really quite sad because there are actors and entertainers of great talent and comedic skill here. Eugene Levy, Christopher Guest, Michael Mckean, Fred Willard and oh heck let's even include Larry Miller as comedic actors I absolutely respect and admire. These are funny people, no question. And then there are actors that I absolutely revere for their accomplishments, like Bob Balaban, who I will always bow to for his first and very young, controversial role in Midnight Cowboy. And Ed Begley Jr. who also calls for and gets my great respect.

Then why, please tell me, why is it that this movie is so gosh darn un-funny? if the cast is loaded with talent then it can only be the writer, director and producer. Guest is a complete failure in this directorial effort. Another thumbs down to Eugene Levy who co-wrote this flop with Guest. I apologize for being so harsh but in all honesty I bought this DVD, paid somewhere around $10 including shipping, and felt taken. I felt bamboozled. In all honesty I, along with my daughter, could not even get through the entire film and turned it off after about an hour. My daughter and I have a running joke; when we say ""best in show"" we break up laughing because we both know that means horrible, self-indulgent movie. There it sits now, in my ""never to be watched again"" basket, where it will eventually go to a future garage sale for $1 or more likely the trash can.

Look, it's true that I am critical. However my scathing criticality is equally matched with my slobbering and generous praise when I experience the pleasure of watching a fine, or at least very entertaining, film. Condemn me if you will but I speak from the heart: this movie was an utter disappointment. I only wish there was a ""zero stars"" rating because Best in Show has earned it.",1369699200,5,2256,4.651629072681704

With all the great reviews, I expected to really like this.  Sure am glad it wasn't expensive.  Don't let little kids watch it due to nudity.  Pretty tacky in my opinion.  I'm almost always in the minority however.

I have seen BEST IN SHOW at least 30 times and still laugh. WAITING FOR GUFFMAN set the stage and BEST IN SHOW takes the baton and runs with it. A perfect mocumentary.

It is the best of the Chrisotpher Guest ensemble movies since 'This is Spinal Tap'. I mean 'A Mighty Wind' and 'Waiting For Guffman' were good but not great...'Best In Show' is GREAT!

The movie follows multiple sets of people preparing and traveling to the country's biggest dog show. It mocks the ridiculous love affair some people have with their pets.

Some of the best quotes:

- ""WHERE'S BUSY BEE? You run and you go get busy bee!""
- ""Don't look at the fat ass losers or freaks, look at me! ""
- ""No, that's a bear in a, in a bee costume.""
- ""I was born with two left feet.""
- ""I'll gouge your right eye out with my thumb, I s*** you not, you little freak!""

The spectacle of the gorgeous dogs and their outrageous handlers provided hours of free entertainment, plus we filled shopping bags full of free samples of dog food for the family mutt from all the vendors.  I still tune in for the Westminster coverage, and chuckle over the glorious absurdity of it all.  So I was predisposed to enjoy this movie, and I certainly did!  As if anyone needed another reason to make fun of lawyers!  That poor Weimeraner!  The bloodhound will snuffle his way into your heart. The Cairn terrier almost redeems terriers. The white poodle is appropriately regal and supercilious.  There are endless lame gay jokes, mostly cracked by the gay characters.

The characterizations are blunt and tie perfectly into the plot which builds along with the comedy. There's an economy of words in the dialogue that makes sure every line adds to the comedic value of the film. The film isn't cheap, or lazy, about making fun of ""dog people,"" as it masterfully sets-up characters to take the fall. The movie has great replay value as there's always some clever nuance to find and laugh at. Best In Show is a must-see comedy.",1363132800,,579,4.858585858585859

1416804,2,B00005ALS0,"... But I found my morals challenged by the cavalier treatment of sex. It seems that the storyline of each of the main characters except Harlan Popper revolved around issues of sexuality, and in only one of the cases was it marital sexuality.  As hilarious as the characters were, I can't recommend the movie, because it flaunts without remorse the Biblical teachings on sex.  It wasn't just a passing thing; the writers made sure that sex was integral to our understanding of these characters.  What a shame.  These actors are obviously talented enough to have done well with a script that wasn't oblivious to the Bible and the Bible's celebration of sex within marriage!",1361750400,2,672,4.868421052631579

It was funny and such a great study of the animal owners.  Kind of a documentary format.  The characters were diverse and very entertaining - from a gay couple to a trophy wife married to a man with one foot  in the grave.  The couple with the terrier was my favorite - he's a nerd and she's been around the block a few too many times but the dog is adorable!!,1361664000,3,512,4.01980198019802

My father is a veterinarian, and I grew up around pets, and pet owners, and pet breeders, and that experience makes the movie even more enjoyable, because as extreme as the characterizations may seem, they are actually grounded in the reality of the show breeding world.",1360972800,2,514,4.7

There's the country boy with his bloodhound, the promiscuous owner with her innocent  husband, the neurotic argumentative couple who only want the best for their dog,and want a prize in the show, the dumb blonde married to a much older man, the gay couple with their little dog, and the commentators.

You might only like this if you have pets or you know about how weird dog shows get. My aunt is a judge for dog shows. My cousin and her husband breed and show their dogs. They are down to earth. Some of the other contestants, not so much. The characters of the film are original and very off the beaten path,so to speak. Fred Willard plays this obnoxious announcer that you want to smack. There isn't much dialog, but the facial expressions , esp Eugene Levy and Ed Begley Jr's are to die for. The way this art piece is done reminds me of the Carol Burnett Sketches. Don't let young kids or hypersensitive people watch this. They will be bored out of their skulls because this movie moves at a leisurely pace,plus their is a lot of sexual inneundo in it.

This film has a great ensemble cast, all with different styles. The format switches between stories of all the contestants preparing for and then participating in the dog show, intermingled with sports-announcing commentary. For me Fred Willard's performance giving that commentary, clearly mostly improv, was the highlight of the film. To be honest, after buying this on Amazon I got email notice that I could watch it as a free download and I did that - so I have not yet opened the disc.

It's a bit more all-audiences than Spinal Tap, while completely skipping the emotional hooks of A Mighty Wind or Waiting For Guffman, but still delivers enough legit snickers to validate a simple retirement as late-night cable network filler. The straight-ahead plot never shows much interest in progressing beyond simple character-driven adventure, and while each member of the cast is good for a smart punchline or two, the roles themselves are universally shallow, narrow caricatures. Fine as a background flick, thrown on to fill the air when your focus will be frequently elsewhere, it will never quite reach the same level as its siblings.",1326240000,,800,5.307086614173229

Just a tidbit of trivia, all of the dogs and extras in the movie came from a dog show that was going on in Vancouver at the time of filming.

Yes, dog people are this crazy. I noticed some of the negative reviews complained about it dragging and slow, well that's what happens in dog shows. If you pass your dog to a professional handler, you don't dare talk to them until everything is over because they're ""in the zone"". And a lot of dog shows is sitting around commenting about other dogs, and overhearing comments about your dog. Yes, I have turned to others in the bleachers and said ""that's my dog"" or even ""that's my dog's sire"".

Characters, characters, characters! That's what.  I believe I watch it so much in hopes of learning something new about each character, and I often do!  And a huge dose of genius by the writers doesn't hurt either.  One day movie makers will learn that is what we crave, not special effect.  Short of the pan down to Eugene Levy's two left feet, I don't think there is a single special effect :)

This classic comedy has one of the best casts in movie history.  The movie follows several groups of dog owners on their quest to be Best In Show at the Mayflower Dog Show.
Every scene is comedy history.  The subtleties of the characters shine as bright as the line-up of stars itself.  Every sentence is delivered with an acting precision seldom seen.  Yet, at the same time, you get the feeling much of it was improved as they went along.

Eugene Levy stands out, Fred Willard shows up just in time to steal the show.  And, all actors will leave you smiling and watching this movie over and over.

Catherine O'Hara is particularly hilarious as the seemingly conservative suburban housewife ""Cookie"" whose promiscuous past continues to catch up with her throughout the movie.

There are not a ton of outright jokes (the TV broadcaster covering the show throws some out) it is all poking fun at the over the top dog owner and the great lengths they go to for their pet.  I think those who will find it the funniest know a friend or family member who lives a similar life (usually childless-like the ones in the movie:).  I have a relative who does ridiculous things for their pet and spends a ton of money on it that is not necessary.  I honestly think some people would save their dog over a person they treat them so crazy.  Mind you, I am a dog person and love my dog, take care of it well but she doesn't go to a day spa and have jewelry!  You can treat dogs respectfully without pampering them to excess and making your whole world revolve around them; to me it seems the core of this movie is making fun of those who cross the line between pet owner and pet pampering to extremes.  I think the negative reviewers had different expectations (one even thought it was a documentary-Ha!).  It is a total farcical look at dog owners going to a dog show and how depressingly seriously they take it (so much so it is funny).  Hope this helps.",1298937600,2,1276,4.239669421487603

1417057,5,B00005ALS0,"I've seen the entire set of Christopher Guest mockumentaries and, since none has appeared since ""For Your Consideration,"" I'm beginning to panic at the thought that the series has come to an end.  It's hard to explain why a cult classic like ""This Is Spinal Tap"" can underwhelm some of us while the Guest send-ups (of the dog show world, of aspiring Hollywood stars, of community theater enthusiasts, of the folk-singing culture of the '60s) are so addictive.  Part of it is the repertory company that consistently appears (Guest, Levy, Willard, O'Hara, etc.).  The first film becomes better with each succeeding film as you marvel at the adaptability of the characters (I didn't even recognize Guest in ""Waiting for Guffman"").  The observation of human nature is as sharp as the eye of a Jaques Tati but never prone to misfires, dull stretches, pointless routines--because the films are organized around a driving compulsion that simply must be seen from inception to conclusion.  The characters are ""types"" but not so over-the-top as to lose their recognizability. And remarkably, I have yet to see a character who, regardless of his or her ticks and obsessions, is unlikable.  Don't expect to be rolling in the aisles (or falling out of bed) but don't be surprised if an occasional howler isn't forceful enough to wake up a nearby companion (they should have been watching, anyway).

Relating the specifics of the plot. characterizations and comedy would be an exercise in futility (what's funny let alone believable about a schlep with 2 left feet?).  But in our hyper, over-glitzy, over-computerized and overly-produced, ""virtual"" worlds that pass for entertainment--from Spieberg over-achieving epic ""events"" to more Robin Williams' feel-good formulae to contrived Ben Stiller family commodities to some of the grosser whoopee cushion films that try to appeal to alternative tastes in low humor--the Guest films emerge as a sort of last frontier for creative, childlike adult minds to approach the making of movies with enthusiasm and gusto, not to mention the old-fashioned-way.

The film is not really about the dogs; it is about the people who love them. People reveal their foibles in the way that they treat their dogs and the competition. My favorite was the yuppie couple (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock) who met at Starbucks. They tear into each other when things don't go their way.

Christopher Guest plays a man from Pine Nut, North Carolina, who takes his bloodhound to the show. I laughed when one of the ""homefolk"" told the bloodhound ""You go up there and put some hurt on them Yankee dogs.""

My only warning about this film is that the humor is subtler than is the humor in most comedies. Fans of Jim Carrey and Chevy Chase are likely to be disappointed.

Everybody plays it absolutely straight, which only adds to the ""humor quotient"".

1417080,5,B00005ALS0,"This movie is unquestionably PG-13.  I found this movie a bit too vulgar in many places.  But that does not change the fact that this was a very funny movie, and very well done.

There are deleted scenes included after the VHS version of this product.  Those scenes weren't at all bad -- some of them were deleted because the movie went a different direction with a couple of the aftermath stories, while others would have just made the movie longer.  The deletion of the scenes shows that they made the movie just the correct length and knew when to stop.  Other movies went on to a part of boredom, and this movie did not.

I am doing research on dog shows for a novel I'm writing.  ""Best In Show"" is not making fun of dog shows but rather having fun with them.  From the audience's point of view, the stars are the dogs.  With the exception of Beatrice the Weimaraner, the dogs didn't really contribute to the movie.  In the movie, the focus was on the characters.

A couple of reviews say people take dog shows too seriously, and some do but for others it's an enjoyable hobby.  For example, I went to an agility show and it seems to be where people and dogs can have fun together.  The conformity part, which is where this movie focuses (there are also obedience trials and herding as well as agility, and the same dog may compete in several of these events), is more of the beauty pagaent, but the reality is it is a group of animal lovers.  Some are as quirky as the characters in the movie, but not all.

One strength was the low key approach to the movie.  John Michael Higgins and Fred Willard have stand out performances, but they would be best described as ""flamboyant"" rather than over the top.  While there is some suspension of disbelief in this movie (e.g. Eugene Levy's character having two left feet), the characters are all realistic and not removed from real life.  My hunch is that if a viewer is rooting for a certain character it is a subjective choice, and a different viewer may identify just as strongly with a different character.  There are no antagonists.  The only character I was hoping wouldn't win were the two-time defending champion, just because they were the two-time defending champion (I have the same view in sports as well).

The casting is perfect.  There are hints of improv in here.  It doesn't have a completely unscripted feeling but there are parts where I have a hunch that an actor has his own script but does not know (or at least does not expect) what another actor will say.  My favorite joke is that the Yuppie couple met at Starbucks -- not the same Starbucks:  they saw each other in different Starbucks across the street from each other.  (I also liked the ""Phantom Hill"" joke in the extra scenes.)

I've never watched the Spinal Tap movie (or Guffman) but I saw the TV special.  Christopher Guest and Michael McKean (one of my favorite comic actors) were in the TV version.  I think I caught a Spinal Tap allusion when the hotel manager was talking about a rock band staying there.

The quality of the artmanship earned this movie the five stars I'm giving it.  I was embarrassed and disgusted with parts of this movie, because of my world view.  Likewise, I would not recommend that children see this movie.  What is needed is a straight PG (if not G) rated movie on dog shows so that children can enjoy the story as well.",1238198400,2,3380,4.4779050736497545

The satire does contain some very cute and original characters. This topic would tempt most film makers to mimic real people.

1417082,4,B00005ALS0,"Obsessive-compulsive behavior is everywhere.  Highly competitive people seem attracted to endeavors that encourage it.  That's why this mock documentary is so funny--dog owners and dog trainers spending time, money and angst in search of that big win in that big show where the ""Best in Show"" win becomes national news.

This is character driven comedy that shows a variety of people caught up in the drama of the ""Mayflower Dog Show"" a stand-in for the Westminster Kennel Club dog show.  Nearly all of the characters depicted in this movie are endearing goofballs who love their dogs. The one exception is the yuppie couple that everyone will love to hate.  Not only are they neurotic and obnoxious but they project those traits on to their dogs...

The dogs are real champions and tremendous good sports although their body language frequently reveals that they are interacting with actors and not their real ""people"".  The movie follows the rule that the owners somehow ""match"" the type of dog, so the bloodhound man gives folksy nutty monologues, the gay couple with the Shih-Tzus redecorate their hotel room just for the night and the modest brown Norwich terrier is carried around by a woman who wears LOUD printed blouses that are down to THERE.

The know-nothing TV commentator is also amusing.  He's been doing it for years and never learned a thing, one gathers.

Maybe this is not laugh-out-loud comedy, but it is becoming almost an annual favorite, trotted out every year or so whenever Westminster is in the news.  If it is not ""Best in Show"", it's certainly a winner nonetheless.",1234656000,,1593,4.928838951310861

The film took itself seriously, which is what most audiences loved, but I just couldn't get into it.

Christopher Guest, who has made comedic improv ""mockumentaries"" an art form, hits the funny bone yet again with his ensemble cast of lovable loons who take competitive dog showing just a tad too seriously.

Improvisational comedy takes a special talent, so Guest employs several Second City veterans to wing it in front of the camera (including Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Michael McKean, and Fred Willard).  While Guest's character (whose name is Harlan Pepper, a classic) and Fred Willard (an empty suit TV announcer) tend to get annoying, the rest of the cast improvs and interacts in pure comedic camaraderie.  In particular, McKean and John Michael Higgins chew up every scene they're in as two very gay boutique operators and dog show enthusiasts; yes, they stumble over every gay stereotype in the book, but they do so with tongue-in-cheek good humor.

Special features.  This edition includes commentaries by cowriters Guest and Levy; both comics basically go through the motions and offer little insight behind the scenes.  Several deleted scenes are available; once viewed, it becomes readily apparent why they were not included in the final cut.  Special feature disappointments aside, BEST IN SHOW is pure, tight, improvisational bliss--a howler in a good way.

""Best in Show"" follows a handful of hopefuls for the coveted top prize at the fictional Mayflower Kennel Dog Show, held in Philadelphia. The film is a mocumentary in which the participants are shown (as by a film crew) in their homes, in interviews, with their friends and preparing for the show. The participants hail from all over the US and represent identifiable types. There's the gay couple, the Southern good-ol' boy, the nerd, the slut, the beauty queen, the irritable yuppies and the lesbian. The characters rarely interact directly -- a scene in which flamboyant Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) tries to freak out straight-laced Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) is an exception -- and are usually shown in private moments with their animals. We meet a harried hotel manager, the show's fusty manager and the out-tight kennel club president. We also meet the media, in the personages of Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), an airheaded, sex-obsessed TV host, and Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock), his exasperated dog-expert sidekick. The humor is neither subtle nor mean, and never lets up.

The selection of stereotyped characters is hilarious and is generally played sympathetically, but is occasionally predictable. The gay couple fussily redecorates its hotel room -- replacing pillows and tacking up wall coverings. The yuppie couple is neurotically obsessed with clothing brands, psychiatrists and Starbucks. The laconic Southern gentleman runs a fishing gear store and dreams of being a ventriloquist. Funny as it is, the film often takes its parody a bit too close to (and occasionally over the edge of) believability. One character's wife keeps running into old boyfriends who are a bit too graphic in their reminiscences. A bit of restraint here would have gotten the message across better. Still, the DVD's deleted scenes show that material that stretched the characters even further out of shape was mercifully left out of the final product.

All in all, ""Best in Show"" was an enjoyable way to spend a Saturday evening. Uncharacteristically, my wife and I laughed out loud quite often. Over-the-top characterizations aside, the film's depictions of the dog show world are fairly accurate (according to my friend, who would know), down to the cast of actually championship dogs. Comedy aside, I found the dog show world fascinating and would love to attend an event. Which goes to show that Christopher Guest's treatments -- whether of heavy metal, folk music or dog shows -- are always loving homages to the eccentricities of the participants and celebrations of their unique contributions to our culture.",1191801600,,2849,5.109442060085837

1417137,5,B00005ALS0,"Many prefer ""Waiting for Guffman,"" but this is the one I could watch over and over again. The story focuses on the Mayflower Kennel Club in Philadelphia and the dog owners/trainers involved in the competition who are going after the ""Best in Show"" title for their pooch. Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara) are a couple from Florida; he's a nerd with two left feet (literally) and she is a former ""reformed"" tramp who seems to have old trick pop up at the most inopportune times. Meg & Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey & Michael Hitchcock) are a couple who put their dog in therapy because the dog saw them having sex and appears to be traumatized. Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) is a hick from North Carolina with a bloodhound. Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) is the trainer for the favored dob, owned by Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge), a kind-hearted bimbo who is married to a rich old geezer. A Shih Tzu owned by a flamboyant gay couple, Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) & Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean), is also part of the competition. Although much of this movie was supposedly improvised, the editing on this particular Guest movie makes it fantastic. No slow-moving moments (other than Guest's sequences) and Coolidge steals the show. So many memorable one-liners  here. Deleted scenes are included, and again, we can be thankful that even more painful moments from Guest were removed. Commentary by Guest & Levy is fun and informative.

1417139,5,B00005ALS0,"To me `Best in Show' is one of the funniest films I've ever seen.  I still can't remember a time when I laughed so hard, I mean truly laughed uncontrollably; complete with tears and those annoying giggles that everyone around you hates to hear.  That's probably the biggest compliment I can give this brilliant film.  It's truly, from top to bottom, beginning to end, one hundred percent hilarious.  Christopher Guest has his fans and supporters, and anyone who's seen his films will immediately find familiar the execution of the material.  In `Best in Show' though I'm tempted to say Guest and company are at their best.  I've seen all of Guest's films and `Best in Show' is by far my favorite.  The entire cast seems on point and together.  Their scenes are downright knee slapping hilarious, and everyone seems to have a full understanding of the character they are trying to be.  With every adlibbed line `Best in Show' gets better and better.

So the film follows a group of dog owners as they ready themselves for national competition.  Each couple is as unique as the dog their preparing and each actor brings their own light to their scenes.  The first couple we meet are Meg and Hamilton Swan, a young couple who share braces, Starbucks and their love of their Weimaraner in common.  Both Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock take home the best-in-show title here for their brilliant comedic performances are just outstanding and their scenes alone are the most memorable of the film.  Their neurotic, passionate, annoying and peppy and it works brilliantly.  Cookie and Gerry Fleck, played by Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy, also work wonders as owners of a Terrier.  O'Hara is hilarious as the less than innocent Cookie, and Levy, whom I'm a huge fan of, is great as her paranoid husband.  Christopher Guest himself is great as Harlan Pepper, the owner of a bloodhound and John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean are hilarious as Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof, the gay couple sporting a pair of Shih Tzu's.  Jane Lynch, Jennifer Coolidge and Patrick Cranshaw stand out though as the three's company of the group, Jennifer playing Sherri Ann Ward Cabot, an Anna Nicole knockoff who married old for money no doubt.  Jane Lynch plays her Poodle's trainer and her disclosed lover.

The film, shot as a mockumentary, is splendidly executed.  The script is really nothing more than an outline of events for the cast is allowed to take the material and run with it infusing a sense of realism in the most exaggerated and outlandish of ways.  It works wonderfully.  The audience is never given a chance to get bored with or tired of the film but is constantly kept entertained.  I have nothing even remotely negative to say about this film.  Everything, even the smallest of supporting roles like Larry Miller and Fred Willard are just top notch and completely engrossing.  It's a must see for any fan of the style, the cast or the brilliance that is Christopher Guest.

I'm a huge fan of all the Guest ""mock-umentaries.""

This one and ""A Mighty Wind"" are my favorites, with ""Spinal Tap,"" a close third, and ""Waiting for Guffman,"" bringing up the rear.  I'm thrilled to hear he's working on another one.

I'm always excited whenever I see one of the Guest gang (O'Hara, Levy, Lynch, Higgins, Willard, Posey, etc.) in another film.  Much has been written about the talent he attracts, and it is spectacular to watch.  With the visual media these days chock full of BS like gorgeous looking crime scene investigators and cute assistant district attorney's, it is so refreshing to see raw talent brought to the screen in these movies.  There wasn't any music in this movie, but catch some of the musical performances in some of the others - by the actors themselves !! - brilliant.

I watched it again with the commentary on and then watched the extra scenes, which I almost never sit still for on a DVD.

The most remarkable part is that the dialogue is improvised by the actors--director (and star) Christopher Guest and co-writer (and star) Eugene Levy wrote the story.  During the shooting, each scene was explained to the actors who then improvised the dialogue.  The technique gives the ""mockumentary"" a very realistic feel.  Comedian Fred Willard has an amazing part as the ""dumb as a hammer"" TV commentator, who in one scene quizzes the dog show's director on the relationship between Mayflower and Philadelphia (a no brainer, he calls it, but then goes on to report that Columbus didn't actually pilot the Mayflower into Philadelphia, but to somewhere in the West Indies).

While Guffman has a cruel streak in it, ""Best in Show"" is a little kinder to the characters it skewers -- without losing the laughs. I would skip the third film in the trilogy (A Mighty Wind) unless you are looking for a bittersweet drama. It's just not that funny.

The situations are scripted by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, but after that they simply let the actors go where they will with the characters and keep the cameras running.  In this movie, he takes aim at dog shows, and the results speak for themselves.

The plot of this film is very simple, as the audience is following 5 dogs and their owners and trainers as the go to compete in the Mayflower Dog Show.  Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins are hilarious as Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donlan, the gay owners of Miss Agnes (a Shih Tzu), and Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are equally funny as the preppy ""win at all cost"" owners (Meg and Hamilton Swan) of  Beatrice (a Weimaraner).  Christopher Guest plays Harlan Pepper, the outdoorsman owner of Hubert (a Bloodhound), Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are the mismatched couple (Cookie and Gerry Fleck) who own Winky (a Norwich Terrier) where Gerry is a geek, and Cookie seems to have ex-lovers all over the country.  Last, but not least, we have Jennifer Coolidge who plays Sheri Ann Ward Cabot the rich owner of the two-time reigning champion Rhapsody in White (a Poodle), and Jane Lynch who plays Christy Cummings the trainer.

The other key members of the cast are Fred Willard, who plays Buck Laughlin the know-nothing TV announcer, and Jim Piddock who is Trevor Beckwith, the knowledgeable color man and who plays the straight man for Willard's antics.  There are also some wonderful smaller roles, such as Larry Miler as one of Cookie's ex-lovers and Ed Begley Jr. as the hotel manager.  Those are just some of the names, but I can't do justice to their wonderful work in such a short review.  The actors are the key to improvisation, and the audience is in good hands with this movie.  The situations are funny, but the performances are even funnier.

""Best in Show"" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 8th, 2000.  It was not nominated for any Academy Awards, but it did win three American Comedy Awards including: Funniest Motion Picture, Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture (Fred Willard), Funniest Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture (Catherine O'Hara), and Christopher Guest was also nominated for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture.  The film was also nominated for and won awards from many different groups such as the American Cinema Editors, Boston Society of Film Critics, British Comedy Awards, Canadian Comedy Awards, the Golden Globes and many more.

This DVD includes an audio commentary by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy which is somewhat low-key, but there are some very funny moments if you pay close attention. Also available are quite a few deleted scenes.  You will also find the features which are almost standard at this point, such as a trailer and cast/filmmaker profiles.

1417183,5,B00005ALS0,"Set in the world of championship dog shows and cast with kooky characters who strive to have their pooch named top dog, BEST IN SHOW is a hilariously funny film that will easily have you laughing out loud.

Though there is a scripted premise, most of the dialog in BEST IN SHOW is ad-libbed by comedic greats that include Christopher Guest, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Ed Begley, Jr. to name just a few.

The gist of BEST IN SHOW is simple: five dogs whose owners have virtually nothing in common with each other, travel to Philadelphia to enter the Mayflower, a prestigious championship dog show, loosely based on the Westminster event.

Beatrice, the emotionless Weimaraner is shown by an uptight yuppie couple (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey) who are nervous wrecks, read the J. Crew catalog like it is a work of great literature and constantly bicker with each other about their dog's mental health and the subtle differences the colors putty and ecru.

Rhapsody in White, the highly coiffed Standard Poodle is owned by a 90 year old kajillionaire's trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) who is having an affair with Christy Cummings, the dog's severe lesbian trainer (Jane Lynch).

Winky, a spunky Norwich Terrier is adored by a former party girl (Catherine O'Hara) and her nerdy, two left footed husband (Eugene Levy) who at every turn is forced to confront his wife's promiscuous past and her sloppy bookkeeping skills.

Miss Agnes, the fluffy white Shih Tzu is the prized pooch of two gay men, played brilliantly by Michael McKean and his campy live-in boyfriend (John Michael Higgins).

Hubert, the sad-eyed Bloodhound is shown by a single country boy, played by Christopher Guest, who created the series of mock documentary films that BEST IN SHOW is one part of.

There are far too many hilarious scenes in BEST IN SHOW to recount.  Particularly great ones include the scene when Winky's owner and her husband check into their hotel and are offered a room in the storage closet by a stiff inn keeper who you may or may not recognize as Ed Begley, Jr.

Another great scene is when a very inappropriate color commentator (Fred Willard) reels off one bizarre observation after another about the dog's trainers, the judges and the clothing of its owners.

But perhaps my favorite scene is when Winky's owners visit an old friend who works as a hostage negotiator and announces almost demonically that when people are on top of a building and threaten to leap to their deaths, ""they all jump.""

BEST IN SHOW is a highly recommended DVD from the same mock documentary genre of This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman.

The gay couple, although I do not approve of homosexual behavior, are truly men I have met; one demure, the other a cut-up who cannot help camping it up every chance he gets.

The silicone-lipped straight-but-maybe-not woman whose dog-trainer is decidedly a lesbian with a warped sense of what is ""classy"", are very very funny because they are so real; just look at the over-the-hill women who think a lot of makeup and flashy clothes, plus a hefty injection of silicone in the lips and elswehere will restore their youth, and you have this character. She's a fine actress and doesn't overplay her role, a balancing act if ever there was one.

Rather, the dog show environment and culture serve merely as a way of revealing the foibles of different sorts of characters in contemporary culture, as well as the genius of talented writers and performers.  It is one of those rare films in which almost every line, facial expression, gesture, and action is perfect and conveys a world of meaning, perspective, and irony.

There's not a whole lot going on in this movie. And I found the characters more sad than funny. It's really not funny that one character hasn't paid a long-overdue credit card bill - it's sad and too often a sad fact of life for some of us. It's not funny that one of the characters has two left feet. It's not funny that one of the couples was attracted to each other because they shopped from the same clothing catalog - it's sad.

1417212,4,B00005ALS0,"All of Christopher Guest's comic mastery as our premiere mockumentarian is on full display here, yet I have never warmed up to this movie the same way I did with ""Waiting for Guffman"". I think there are two reasons. First, the diversity of characters in ""Best in Show"", spread across socioeconomic classes and geographic distances, doesn't produce as inherently likable or close-knit a group as the good citizens of Blaine, Missouri.  Second, the concept of a first-person interview movie will inevitably feel less fresh the second time around, especially when many of the same actors are being cast. These concessions aside, this is still an extremely funny movie with an edginess that makes ""Waiting for Guffman"" feel all the more innocent.

The plot revolves around the fictional Mayflower Dog Show, a Westminster look-alike, being held in Philadelphia, and the eccentric gallery of dog lovers vying for the blue ribbon. First, we have Gerry and Cookie Fleck, played by Eugene Levy (who like ""Guffman"", co-wrote the witty script with Guest) and Catherine O'Hara, with their Norwich terrier, Winky. In Levy's hands, Gerry is a blood brother to his previous Dr. Pearl but this time, his character has two left feet...literally...and a satisfying moment of victory Pearl could never experience. O'Hara ebulliently makes Cookie a likeable nymphomaniac with a heart of gold.  John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean play an affectionate and flamboyant gay couple, with their Shih Tzu, Miss Agnes. While Higgins lays on the double entendres pretty thick, McKean actually provides a nice balance to their relationship, and the combination makes for more than a ""Birdcage"" knock-off.

There is also the yuppie couple from hell, high-strung and high-maintenance lawyers Meg and Hamilton Swan, played with uncompromising fury by Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock, who spoil their Weimaraner, Beatrice, mercilessly. Posey, in a severe turnabout from her lackadaisical Dairy Queen waitress in ""Guffman"", is particularly strong and edgy at playing the neurotic harpy in search of the elusive bumblebee squeaky toy. With her collagen-injected lips and heavily suctioned breasts, the comically zaftig Jennifer Coolidge plays an Anna Nicole Smith-like trophy wife who comes out of the closet to her hyper-competitive trainer, portrayed by Jane Lynch, with their poodle, Rhapsody in White, in tow. And Guest downshifts from his previous Corky St. Clair significantly to play soft-spoken Harlan Pepper, a red-haired bait-and-tackle shop owner from the backwoods of North Carolina, who loves his devoted bloodhound, Hubert.  For all the comic brilliance generated by the actors playing the dog owners, the show is stolen by the comically irrelevant ranting of Fred Willard, who plays a most idiotic sportscaster who doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. Everyone exhibits sharp improvisational skills, as the press notes indicate that the actors were only given a script outline and encouraged to shape their characters onscreen with no rehearsal.

In the commentary, Guest mentions sixty hours of footage were produced to make this ninety-minute laugh fest. The effort was worth it, as there is not a moment wasted in this comedy. I only wish it inherited some more of the heart of ""Guffman"" to relieve us from the more scabrous parts of the script.

I enjoyed watching it, but by the end I found myself thinking of all of the wasted potential.  The real dog shows are simply insane beyond the comprehension of normal people.  The various breeds of dogs border sometimes on the freakish, and their handlers often are close behind.  This is all just so ripe for the picking, yet this movie too often falls back on familiar and sometimes tired cliches.  For me, it kept the movie from being hilarious instead of simply amusing.

If I would have had absolutely nothing better to do, and was bored out of my mind, I probably would have watched it. It wasn't a bad movie, and I wouldn't say it was boring, it was just un-interesting. It was cool to see christopher guest playing a southern backwoods sort of character who raised a bloodhound. Keep in mind, This Is Spinal Tap is my favorite movie. I have seen it dozens of times. I thought about it, and one thing about Spinal Tap that made it better, was that in between the interviews, there was actual concert footage of them playing, which was cool. Obviously, people not interested in rock music would probably not care for it. I love dogs, and I even watch the national kennel club dog shows on tv each year.

He has the most intriguing directing style I've come across, hands down.  Pure improv, allowing each cast member to sit and vent/contemplate for 10 minutes at a time, and then later goes back to edit and seal the final masterpiece.  This movie caused many belly-laughs and moments where I was chuckling so hard, zero noise was coming out.  The premise for this movie and his other mockumentaries have been fantastic, no other person would have the gusto or the skill to go forth and expose these all-to-common real life scenarios like Guest has.  He has consistantly created characters who are unforgettable (the mark of a great comedian) and his ability to improvise is astounding; vocabulary constitutes a big part of successful comedy, and Guest obviously has a stunning array of one-liners and collected phrases that seem to come out with picture-perfect timing.  Moving onward to members of his cast: Michael Mckean does such a great job of expressing himself on screen, he accomplishes this by speaking in a relaxed, yet semi self-crazed tone.  ""She tries to be so self-possessed but look at the face, she's full of fear.""  Parker Posey plays the Mrs. Swan role with absolute ability, her reactions are wild, ""I got in a position that was very painful, emotionally, for me.  It's called 'congress of the cow.'""  Fred Willard made the last half of the film memorable and hilarious, his commentary is original and breathtaking.  Fred often gets critized, but I'd like to see anyone else come up with the lines that he instinctly lets fly.  Now back to Guest: his knowledge of flyfishing made me fall out of my chair, ""You could use a Disco Midge, a Beadhead, a Patch Adams.""  While driving in his RV he unleashes a flurry of comedy all by way of making you believe this is an old boy who loves his dog and knows his nuts!  (Please see the additional scenes, there is extra footage of him talking about ""phantom hill"" and ""turtle woman"").  My favorite portion of the DVD happens to be the additional scenes.  From ""Harlan and Arrowheads"" (which is a gut-buster) to ""Stephan at the Salon"", can you ask for anything more?  Mckean is so god-damn-funny that it makes one ponder how this bit didn't wind up in the theatrical version?  ""The French don't know anything about shampooing.  If you're wondering about a shampooing sink go straight to the Dutch!"" haha.  Or ""We bought out the Chinese.  Not the nation, but you know, that little chapter behind the wall."" ah haha.

Serious, collected, and awkward, with the result being one of the most unique and clever films ever made.

Christopher Guest (Director/Screenwriter) is a genius in this sort of comedy. You may have seen, ""This Is Spinal Tap"", ""Waiting For Guffman"", or ""A Mighty Wind""; all brilliant mockumentaries.

To my surprise, not many people I know like this movie. Some people like it, but they don't think it's hilarious like I do.

The dogs are probably the most sane of the characters, for their owners are neurotic, repressed, and otherwise dysfunctional.

1417233,3,B00005ALS0,"Christopher Guest has a rare misstep in ""Best in Show,"" the follow-up to comedy classic ""Waiting for Guffman."" While ""Best"" is still a fun and frenetic mockumentary, it isn't up to the standards of its sibling mockumentaries -- it's a little too repetitive and over-the-top.
Welcome to Philadelphia, the home of the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. Among the crazy dog owners are Starbucks yuppies Hamilton and Meg Swan (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey), gay couple Scott and Stefan (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean), ventrilogist hick Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest), and buxom airhead Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge) and her lover/trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch). Front and center is two-left-footed Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) and his wife Cookie (Catherine O'Hara), whose sexy past keeps coming back to haunt her.

All these people converge at the dog show, and face difficulties ranging from wrenched knees to televised lesbian smooches to lost squeaky toys -- and some of the dogs are getting a bit crazy as well. With an obnoxious commentator watching over it all, they all strive for the ultimate prize. Poodle, Norwich terrier, bloodhound, Shih Tzu or emotionally scarred Weimaraner -- who will be best in show?

""Best in Show"" does for dog shows what ""This is Spinal Tap"" did for old metal -- it makes affectionate fun of them. Christopher Guest returns to mockumentary turf in the moderately funny ""Best in Show"" -- it's flawed, but still far above the average comedy.

The biggest problem with ""Best in Show"" is that Guest tries too hard. The jokes and goofiness are over-the-top, belying the mockumentary format. And the jokes get a bit repetitive. How many times can Cookie run into old boyfriends? Isn't the gay humor both cliched and overdone? But, the humor itself is quite funny, with plenty of strange lines like ""We have so much in common! We both love soup... and the outdoors... snow peas... talking and not talking. We could not talk or talk forever and still find things to not talk about.""

No flaws can be found in the veteran mockumentary cast -- these people look like they're having a good time. Hitchcock and Posey are chillingly good as the couple who met over J. Crew catalogues in a Starbucks, while Coolidge is deliciously dumb as a bisexual Anna Nicole Smith clone. McKean and Higgins, despite being cliched, play their roles with unadulterated delight. Fred Willard's vulgar commentator is over-the-top stupid, but still amusing.

Despite repetitive humor and the occasional dud joke, Christopher Guest's follow-up to ""Waiting for Guffman"" is an amusing look behind the scenes of dog shows. It's not ""Best in Show,"" but it's one of the best of breed.",1089417600,,2701,5.033557046979865

'Best In Show: is hands down the very best of Mr. Guests's mockumentaries to date.  When you consider that the majority of the film is improvisational, with the characters given a basic structure from which to work and then allowed to ""go where their creativity takes them"" you get a real appreciation of just what a good ensemble cast can capture/create.
This particular outing takes on the world of dog shows and follows the exploits of various dog owners to the Best In Show finals.  It is a stitch!  There is something here for everybody.  Of course the standout is Fred Willard as an obnoxious commentator who really deserved winning the Oscar for supporting actor for which he was nominated.  The character study of each dog owner of course sheds infinite light into why they are so obsessed with their dog receiving the top award.
The improvisation is top-notch but I would expect nothing less.  Catherine O'Hara is generally flawless and here she does not disappoint.  She is in RARE form!  She and Eugene Levy play off each other quite well.  Other cast members that I have seen in ""Waiting for Guffman"" as well as ""A Mighty Wind"" continue to be consistently creative and funny and I welcome their efforts. While ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" pale in comparison, they too reveal flashes of the genius of Mr. Guest and company.

1417250,4,B00005ALS0,"I already knew going in that I like folk music a lot more than dog shows, anniversary pageants, or heavy metal music, which explains why ""A Mighty Wind"" remains my favorite of the Christopher Guest mockumentaries, but ""Best in Show"" certainly has its moments.  Dog shows are a great target for satirical skewering simply because you do not have to go too far to accomplish the task since the dogs we see posing and prancing are not like the dogs the rest of us know in the real world.  But the dogs are the innocents in this tale, even if they are exposed to the sight of their masters making love.  It is the owners who are invited to humiliate themselves simply by being themselves.
The focus point of ""Best in Show"" is the Mayflower Kennel Club's dog show in the city of Brotherly Love.  The script is by Guest and Eugene Levy, but the idea of a scripted film is a misnomer since what is really at play are the improvisational techniques of Second City more than the crafted skits of Saturday Night Live.  In the grand plan of such mockumentaries we follow the paths of several dogs and their owners, most of whom will indeed be up for the grand prize:
Harlan Pepper (Guest) and his bloodhound, Hubert (Ch. Quiet Creek's Stand By Me); Gerry (Levy) and Cookie Fleck (Catharine O'Hara) and their Norwich terrier, Winky (Can. Ch. Urchin's Bryllo); the catalog loving Meg (Parker Posey) and Michael Hitchcock (Hamilton Swan) and their sleek but troubled weimaraner, Beatrice (Can. Ch. Arokat's Echobar Take Me Dancing); Scott Donlon (John Michael Higgins) and Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean), a happy gay couple raising twin Shih Tzus, Miss Agnes (Can. Ch. Raptures Classic) and Tyrone (Can. Ch. Symarun's Red Hot Kisses); and airhead Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) married to a geriatric millionaire who has hired the lesbian dominatrix Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) to train a two-time defending champion Rhapsody in White (Brocade Exclamation Ca. Ch. Exxel Dezi Duz It With Pizaz), the Standard Poodle.
The actual dog show is pretty much done straight in terms of what we see out on the floor (seeing Don S. Davis as the Best in Show judge was a treat).  The characters might run their dogs around in their own manners, some with more flare than others (i.e., Higgins), but the dogs are trying their best.  The same can be said for genial Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), who is providing commentary on the dog show for the folks watching at home on television.  Buck's comments have as little to do with what is actually going on as possible, while commentator Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock) tries to bear the errant slings and arrows coming out of Buck's mouth as he steals the last half of the movie.
The climax of the dog show is one of the subtlest jokes in ""Best in Show,"" but if you think about America's affection for the underdog in sporting competitions, even those involving actual dogs, you will get the point.  This is perhaps the most subtle of the Guest mockumentaries, which may or may not be saying something.  Whether it becomes a personal favorite is going to depend on your affection for dogs as much as it does on your affection for the usual stable of players that Guest has once again rounded up for the festivities.",1073952000,11,3251,4.707746478873239

1417255,5,B00005ALS0,"Director Rob Reiner may have set the standard for the ""mockumentary"" with ""This is Spinal Tap"", but one of the stars of that movie, Christopher Guest, had refined it with his own ""Waiting for Guffman."" Guest is one of Hollywood's funniest comedians, but since he sticks to being funny instead of getting in trouble with drugs/hookers/transvestites/ whatever, he never seems to get the recognition he deserves. Maybe this will change with his new opus, ""Best in Show.""
This time out we learn about the ""special"" relationships people can have with their dogs as we follow a broad range of deluded people on their way to their personal Superbowl, the Mayflower Dog Show.
From Pine Nut, North Carolina we meet Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) and his Bloodhound, Hubert. Harlan knows a lot about fly-fishing and nuts, but perhaps not as much about ventriloquism as he'd like.
Yuppie lawyers Meg (Parker Posey) and Hamilton Swan (Michl Hitchcock) are drowning in their clothing catalogues and sizable neuroses in Illinois, and have transferred their insanity to their Weimaraner, Beatrice.
Fern City, Florida men's wear salesman Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) could focus on Norwich Terrier Winkey if he could only stop running into men that slept with his wife Cookie (Catherine O'Hara). Apparently she married him because he was last in line.
Probably most entertaining is New York dog handler Scott Donlan (John Michl Higgins) and his longtime partner, salon proprietor Stefan Vanderhoof (Michl McKean). Of their matching Shih Tzus, they believe Miss Agnes stands the best chance of winning.
When the big show arrives, all must face the previous two-time winner, Poodle Rhapsody In White owned by decrepit millionaire Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw) and his young trophy wife Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge). To ensure success, Sherri Ann has hired professional dog handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), but the two women are distracted by their, uh, mutual chemistry.
Although similar in style, there are several differences between ""Best in Show"" and ""Waiting for Guffman"". While both movies credit Guest and Levy as writers, you can sense more in the way of structure in their newest work. This is probably due, in part, to another big change. ""This is Spinal Tap"" and ""Waiting for Guffman"" both followed a cast of characters, but those groups were, more or less, in pursuit of a single, unified goal. In ""Best of Show"", the different characters starting from different locations and only come together to compete against each other for the same prize. As such, we don't get as much interaction between the different characters as we'd like. The final product also feels much denser as a result of cutting back and forth between all of their different storylines.
Still, it all comes down to how good the cast is, and everyone delivers. Guest himself takes more of a backseat as his southern eccentric is usually by himself. Posey excels, as expected, in a part that allows her to be completely unhinged. Most of the cast do fine jobs, particularly Levy and O'Hara. There are, however, three standouts. First, Fred Willard is the funniest I've even seen him as a dog show announcer who doesn't know anything about dogs, or apparently what jokes might be inappropriate for the venue. Lynch, who had previously wallowed in television and bit movie parts, makes the most of this opportunity and matches the lunacy of anyone else present.
Of everyone, there is one man who truly reaches a new plateau, and that man is John Michl Higgins. You know he's got to be good when Michl McKean plays the ""quiet one"" in the relationship. Forget Jack from ""Will and Grace"", Higgins' Scott Donlan is the true queen of the ball. His flaming, naughty antics and wardrobe dominate the screen every time he's on. Frighteningly, the one thing I remember him from is his portrayal of David Letterman in HBO's adaptation of Bill Carter's ""The Late Shift"". Yikes!
Now, is this movie actually better than ""Waiting for Guffman""? Mmmm, no. As that group of characters built toward something together, it had more punch in the end, rather than watching the new bunch take turns presenting their animals in the newer film. It's still a great movie. The point to these exercises, as both Reiner and Guest know, is not to just spend 90 minutes mocking the adventures of some exaggerated characters. The directors love all the inmates of their asylums, so the audience does too. Too often, when others try this kind of thing, their subjects are little more than a pile of absurd character tics. A full-length feature must be more developed than a half-assed ""Saturday Night Live"" skit. The filmmakers don't just need to make us laugh, the must, as Guest has done, make us care.",1071705600,2,4747,4.979848866498741

1417278,4,B00005ALS0,"Christopher Guest's ""Best in Show"" is a wildly hilarious satire that pokes fun at people who are overly obsessed with their pets.  So obsessed that they would take their pets and put them in a type of ""beauty pageant"" in order to get awards and recognition.  It's funny and unrelenting because you see it as an everyday occurrence in society.  People like this really do exist, and that is why it's so humorous.  The characters are all out of their minds and are a joy to watch in this very entertaining and unpredictable film.
I had no idea what I was going to experience when I popped this into the DVD player.  At first, it didn't seem like anything that would interest me.  However, almost every single person I know had seen it and encouraged me to watch it.  I'm glad I did give it a chance, because I ended up really liking it.  The satire is outrageous and subtle at the same time (something that's VERY difficult to accomplish unless the project is in the right hands).  The actors are hilarious and very animated, but at the same time you know that these types of people really do exist!  Eugene Levy was my favorite person in the film.  He's so subtle and clever when it comes to humor.  Overall, everybody was fantastic in their roles.
The DVD has some really cool extras.  It has very good picture and sound quality.  Extras included are deleted scenes, feature length audio commentary by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, theatrical trailer and more.  The deleted scenes are pretty interesting to watch.  Tons of special features for those who love the extra ""bells and whistles.""

The premise of the movie is a documentary following five dogs, and their ""eccentric"" (I am being kind!) owners/handlers, bringing the dogs to a championship dog show.
I really enjoyed this partly because I have been to dozens of dog shows myself, and have seen vitual carbon copies of most of the characters portrayed in the movie. This movie has characters a bit over the top, but they remind me of people I have seen, and heard of in local show circuits.
Brief descriptions of some characters (they are all too deep to try and describe in a few words)... One yuppie couple is obsessed with catalog shopping and Starbucks. There is a wealthy owner/arrogant handler pairing. A southern man with his bloodhound. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy as a mismatched couple that write songs about terriers. A gay couple portrayed by Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins steal the show in my opinion. There is not a bad performance in this film.
John Michael Higgins' flamboyance and one liners, Catherine O'Hara's promiscuous past, Eugene Levy's two left feet, The search for ""busy bee"" - great stuff.
Most of the script is improvised, which is almost unbelievable to me because of the great dialogue.
Fred Willard is hilarious as the know nothing co host/tv announcer.

1417282,4,B00005ALS0,"A Film by Christopher Guest
I'm probably one of a few, but I wasn't a huge fan of This is Spinal Tap (a Rob Reiner film starring much of the same cast including Christopher Guest).  With that in mind, I wasn't sure that I would be a big fan of the mockumentary genre.  But, I keep hearing that Best In Show is a great movie.  I finally gave it a shot (as much to see the dogs as it was to see the movie).
Best in Show is a mockumentary (a fictional documentary) about a dog show.  We are introduced to the characters as we would in a documentary.  They give interviews talking about who they are, who their dogs are, and about their goals for the dog show (naturally, everyone expects to win).  Everyone is somewhat neurotic.  The movie stars Parker Posey (Party Girl), Eugene Levy (American Pie), Catherine O'Hara (Waiting for Guffman), and Michael McKean (A Mighty Wind).  While Levy and O'Hara seem to get the most time, nobody is really shorted a time to shine.  One of the fun things about this movie is that it is almost completely improvised all the way through, which makes for some very interesting spots and lines.
This is a movie of the absurd.  While I didn't find anything to be rolling on the floor funny, I found so much of the movie to be humorous.  The co-announcer at the dog show had some of the best lines as he just asked question after question and while most of his questions/comments would be inappropriate for an actual dog show, this made it all the funnier.  Another highlight for me was Parker Posey.  The movie was filled with interesting characters, each with a different take on the dog show.  I don't think this will be one of my favorite films, but it is definitely a good one, and a funny movie.",1059436800,,1729,4.379310344827586

1417285,5,B00005ALS0,"Director and co-screenwriter Guest has been centrally involved with the creation of four of the best ""mockumentaries"": This Is Spinal Tap (1983), Waiting for Guffman (1996), Best in Show (2000), and A Mighty Wind (2003). The effectiveness of a mockumentary depends on several factors. First, the actors must ""play it straight,"" as if unaware that they are spoofing anyone or anything. Fred Willard (Buck Laughlin), for example, in this film or Leslie Nielsen in Airplane! or as Frank Drebin in the Naked Gun series. Also, the material presented must be THAT close to the original as is indeed true of the music performed in A Mighty Wind. Finally, the objects of ridicule must in some way deserve it (e.g. Bob Balaban as Dr. Theodore W. Milbank III) but the humor must never be mean-spirited. Note Guest's treatment of the fact that Gerry Fleck (played with the straightest of faces by Eugene Levy) has -- literally -- two left feet.
In this film, Guest uses a familiar but effective strategy for the basis of his narrative: Select several individuals and follow their separate journeys to the same destination, in this case a dog show in Philadelphia. Harlan Pepper (Guest) and the Flecks (Levy and Catherine O'Hara) are among among those who have registered their dogs for competition in the annual and prestigious Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show in Philadelphia. Shrewdly, Guest and Levy have co-written a screenplay in which there is a wide and rich variety of people involved. One of the most conspicuous is Sherri Ann Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge), a statuesque and voluptuous bi-sexual, who attends the show with her ancient husband (Patrick Cranshaw), hoping that her poodle ""Rhapsody in White"" can win again. Sherri Ann is also accompanied by Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), the dog's trainer/handler and Sherri Ann's lover. Meg and Michael Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock) are also there with Beatrice, a Weimaraner who is almost (not quite) as neurotic as they are. Still another interesting couple consists of Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) and his life partner Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean) who have entered their Shih Tzu ""Miss Agnes"" in the competition and expect her to win.
Many years ago, I first saw Fred Willard (with Martin Mull) on the television series Fernwood 2-Night. He recreates essentially the same role (pseudo-sophisticate dimwit) in this film as Buck Laughlin. He and Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock) provide commentary throughout the competition. Insofar as Beckwith is concerned, the chemistry between them could not be much worse. However, as a mockumentary requires, Laughlin is oblivious to that...and to just about everything else as he prattles and chortles along. Willard's is a stunning performance. What a treat it would be to eavesdrop on a conversation between Willard's Laughlin and Nielsen's Drebin.
This is film loses nothing even after being seen several times. In fact, I see something ""new"" each time I see it again. (For me, the same is also true of Young Frankenstein and The Birdcage.) Some of the scenes and some of the characters become even more hilarious. For example, when Scott and Stefan register at the hotel and then begin to redecorate their room, when the Flecks visit one of Cookie's many former boyfriends and his family, and what happens after the Flecks' Norwich terrier ""Winky"" reaches the final round of competition. Guest cleverly concludes his film by answering the question ""Whatever happened to....?"" thereby providing an update on each of couples as well as of Harlan long after the competition. If I were judging all of the comedies released two years ago, this would be my own choice for the top prize: Best in Show(Business) Comedy Film 2000.",1058313600,5,3730,5.09640522875817

We meet a number of characters, including a gay couple, a neurotic couple, a man who operates a fishing shop, and so on. We see them in their daily lives, follow them in their trip to the dog show, and the happenings there.
The most interesting thing about Best in Show is its narrative structure - mainly composed of sustained shots of individuals or couples, documentary-style, talking at the camera as if they were being interviewed about their lives and what they are doing at the moment.
It is interesting to watch, but this movie is not funny. It has few laughs in it, and the attempts are ham-handed. For example, we see a man who literally has two left feet, or a gay couple which decorates its hotel room. Is this stuff funny ? Sure, if you've never seen a comedy before.  In fact, the funniest scene on the DVD is not in the movie, but a deleted scene - where Harlan Pepper (the most interesting character, in my opinion) talks about the degrees of greatness of his dog's nose compared to a space shuttle, and it is a scene which is not only funny but works on many levels.
I'd say this symbolizes what this movie could have been. We don't care about the dog show, except as a framework, and the scenes involving it are not very funny.

They're all here and you have to marvel at how on-target the portrayals are. However, ""Best In Show""'s appeal isn't limited to dog owners, trainers and groomers. It's a great comedy on all levels and any observer of the human condition will find themselves laughing like an idiot despite themselves.
The DVD edition of the movie is particularly worthwhile as it has some great outtakes that didn't make the cut. It's clear that the high level of skill at improvisation that the cast members possess made the movie what it is, a casual mock-documentary that ends up blowing you away with its brilliance.

The funniest part about it is Fred Willard as the first judge during the competition. There are some other funny lines and parts, but he steals the show, no pun intended.

1417322,5,B00005ALS0,"Best in Show is what could only be described as an affectionate mockumentary of the world of dog shows and their occasionally over-obsessed, over-ambitious, neurotic and downright barking mad owners. Co-written, directed and starring Christopher Guest, best known as Nigel Tufnell in `This Is Spinal Tap', this could very much be considered the canine equivalent of Rob Reiner's acclaimed cult movie, for instead of a rock band behaving badly, instead we have some rather over-obsessed dog owner's behaving madly. If you will excuse the obvious pun, this is not so much Spinal Tap, as This is Spaniel Yap.
One of the great things about `Best In Show' is that it is played as a straight documentary, and we never get any glimpses of the supposed documentary makers filming the would be champions proud owners and there are no nudges and winks to the camera. Very much as real documentaries do, `Best In Show' follows five different couples from vastly different social backgrounds but all childless, with the exception of the four legged friends, as they seek tp win the title of top dog at the annual Mayflower dog show. It is very much fly on the wall and even though all the characters might be characterised as stereotypical, there is actually very little caricature, which is what makes it immensely funny and if you didn't know better, you might even believe it was real. There are no [] jokes that revolve around dog [mess] and most importantly of all `Best In Show' is consistently funny all the way through.
There is so much to enjoy about this movie. Christopher Guest subtly directs it and it has a sharp and acutely well-observed script. It very much affectionately mocks the owner's whilst never seeking to either mock man's best friend or the world of dog shows. In fact I would say that to really enjoy this movie it helps to be a dog lover, you even find yourself laughing because in certain parts you recognise that some of the behaviour exhibited by the neurotic owners is not so different to ourselves with our own furry friends.
The cast of this movie includes no big stars but many familiar faces. For example Eugene Levy, the movie's co-author, who is previously best known for his role as the emabressing Dad in the American Pie movies appears as the literally two left-footed owner of a Norwich Terrier. His wife is played by Catherine O'Hara (Home Alone, Dick Tracy), who has a somewhat colourful past that seems to include a string of lovers in every bar in every town, much to Gerry's embaressment. There is also a [] couple played by Michael McKean, another Spinal Tap alumnus and John Michael Higgins (Ally MacBeal) who show shih-tzus and in the case of the latter, camp it up outrageously. Parker Posey (Scream 3) and Michael Hitchcock (Happy, Texas) play neurotic yuppie lawyers and parents to a Weimaraner apparently traumatised after seeing them perform `the congress of the cow' from the karma sutra. Director Christopher Guest (Waiting For Guffman) plays a redneck bloodhound owner who can name every type of nut but tackiest of all is the gold-digging Sherri married to a senile millionaire about to shuffle off this mortal coil played by Jennifer Coolidge (Legally Blonde), who is on the brink of a lesbian affair with the trainer of her beloved standard poodle. Ed Begley jnr even puts in a cameo appearance as a hotel manager. All the actors perform there parts with great subtlety and it is to their credit that many of the lines were apparently improvised.
If `Best In Show' is for the most part a movie that keeps you quietly chuckling, it is also a film that will have you laughing out loud when the contestants finally reach the main event (The Mayflower Dog Show), as commentary for the show is provided in a sports cast style by Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard) who openly flaunts his ignorance of all things canine to comical effect and we are also treated to the sight of Gerry, two left feet `n all parading his Norwich Terrier around the show ring. This is a little gem of a movie that I highly recommend.",1042502400,2,4050,4.746099290780142

I realize that Guest's approach to comedy is often more obtuse than direct (SPINAL TAP), but here I just felt like I was going along for the ride.  I never really engaged much in the film itself.

The scene with her shopping for a new toy for her mutt are exquisite.

Although the movie has something for everyone, it is probably most enjoyed by those of us who consider it felicitous that the Westminster Dog Show falls around Valentine's Day. Dog obsessives will recognize their quirks taken to an illogical extreme.
Still, the humor is never mean-spirited. Although the movie certainly doesn't leave one with the desire to enter the dog-show world, it mocks gently.

1417361,4,B00005ALS0,"This film is what a friend of mine calls a ""mock documentary.""  It ""documents"" the obsessive lives of dog-owners as they prepare for a national dog competition.  I put ""documents"" in quotes because what it really ends up doing is making fun of these people.  Each couple ""interviewed"" in the film has their own quirks, none more evident than the manic-depressive Weimaraner of Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock.  (You know how some dog owners end up resembling their pets (or the other way around)?  Parker Posey's look was dead on.)  Christopher Guest ends up being the handler of a bloodhound (and either he owns the dog or is really good with it, because they're awesome together).  Eugene Levy as the husband with two left feet (literally) also cracked me up.
I'm not even sure whether the actors stuck to a script because it felt completely improvised as each actor fed on what their fellow actors said.  It's amazing.
But, hands down, I thought the highlight of this comedy was Fred Willard as the commentator of the competition.  He is absolutely hilarious.  It's fairly obvious he knows nothing about dog competitions, or dogs for that matter.  It's not even clear how he got the job.  His fellow announcer, an English fellow, is forced to endure Willard's outrageous and dirty remarks while at the same time trying to provide a helpful commentary for the audience.
In the same style as Waiting for Guffman, this film is divided into the pre-event, event, and post event interview segments.
I recommend this film for people who likes to see things blown out of proportion (figuratively).  It's not a very fast paced film, and lacks any of the qualities that might garner it mass appeal.  But it is a funny look into the even funnier world of dog breeders.

Hard for me to pick a favorite out of this ensemble cast, but I'd have to say the performances of Jennifer Coolidge (We both love Soup) Michael McKean (No quote, but his best stuff was left on the cutting room floor which thankfully is included on the DVD)or Fred Willard (To think in some countries these dogs are eaten!).

The laughs are not drawn from slapstick but from the human condition: from neuroticism to arrogance, from simplicity to sexuality.  Best in Show relies more on words and situations than prat-falls and gross gags.
Every character is perfectly cast (without the help of overpaid, big name actors) and the comic timing is right on target.  Sometimes, we don't expect to laugh and we're surprised.  The documentary style is effective, allowing the audience to concentrate less on visuals and more on the interactions between characters and the witty dialogue.  Plus, there are some really beautiful animals in this film that should not be ignored.
This is one of those films you can watch over and over again and still laugh at.

The movie is shot like a documentary about these many dog owners getting their prize dogs groomed, and getting ready for the coming events.

One of the funniest bits in the movie, for me at least, is one couple's horrified realization that they have left their dog's ""comfort toy"" at home. A frenzied visit to an upscale petshop uncovers lots of toys...just not the right one. The ultra-serious conversation between the haughty salesperson and the distraught dog owner is outrageous!
As a dog lover myself, I could only lean back and howl over the all-too-human shenanigans of the owners and trainers. And just in case it's a tad too subtle for some of us, Fred Willard gives an inspired performance as a know-nothing television announcer calling the play-by-play, with his horrified partner, who DOES know about dog shows, standing helplessly by, unable to get a word in edgewise.

Sure, we could find such interesting and off-beat characters in any such endeavor with a sizeable population.  Here, the plot revolves around following some ""best of show"" competitors, minus the Weimarner who is DQ'd.  The scene of these DINK's who are into clothes, and starbucks, with their shrink talking about how the dog reacted to their sex life is a stitch.
Harlan Pepper is equally a riot.  From his ""nuts recitation"" to his fly fishing expertise, this pokes fun at people who are really into what they're into.  Good for them!

I've watched the Westminster dog show on television a couple of times-Danes almost never win best in show-so I've gotten a feel for the venue, and the movie has captured it right down to the interviews with the sponsor and various dog owners and the chatty repartee of the narrators.
The work is done much in the style of another ""interview"" film, This is Spinal Tap, and like that work, this one is just as convincing despite the outrageous behavior of some of the characters.  So talented were the various actors that I actually believed they were what they suggested they were.  It wasn't until my husband pointed out that he'd seem them in other comedic parts that he was able to convince me that they weren't part of the dog show milieu.
My favorite character was the owner of the blood hound (Christopher Guest, the director himself) whose conversation was so deadly dull that he could glaze the eyes of his listeners.  His discussion while at a cocktail party of the various lures used in fly fishing is quite entertaining as are the desperate attempts of his victims to politely escape him.

1417409,4,B00005ALS0,"Best in Show is a clever 'mocumentary', a delightful satire of the dog show world. Director Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy also star in the movie, along with a slew of other comic actors. As writers, Guest and Levy are throwbacks to kinder, gentler times. Their brand of satire is funny and sometimes biting, but it is never brutal. They allow the performers to improvise a lot. This doesn't always work out, but when it does, the results are hysterical. The movie succeeds because the dogs' owners, not the dogs themselves, are the real characters. It shows that in the bond between man and dog, man may be the strangest and funniest half.
At the start, we meet several couples and individuals who will be showing their dogs in the Mayflower competition in Philadelphia. Some are shown in real scenes, other in fake interviews. Christopher Guest is Harlan Pepper, a down home North Carolina boy who runs a fishing supply store. He also raises champion blood hounds and dreams of being a ventriloquist. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara play the Flecks. He literally has two left feet, and she is an aging hot babe, who is constantly running into men from her past, much to Mr. Fleck's annoyance. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are the Swans, a couple of yuppie lawyers who have channeled way too much emotion into their dog. Sherri Ann [Jennifer Coolidge] is a very buxom and very wealthy matron who, along with her trainer, Christie [Jane Lynch], has entered her pom-pommed poodle. Finally, we met Scott and Stephan [John Michael Higgins and Michael McKeen], a gay couple who has entered one of their beloved toy dogs. In their spare time, Scott and Stephan produce calendars, using photos of their dogs dressed up like characters in famous movies.
The movie follows the characters before, during and after the competition. The show itself is quite authentic looking. It even spoofs sports announcing. One of the announcers is a proper Englishman, full of knowledge about dog shows. The other is an American who is completely clueless. Their scenes are among the film's funniest.
The humor is Best in Show is too dry for some viewers. It's often subtle comedy. I enjoyed it, but I like my humor from broad to dry and everything in-between. I also think I share Guest and Levy's point of view. They seem to be dog lovers who think that what goes on in the world of championship dog lovers is somewhat over the top. What the characters in the movie express towards dogs isn't exactly love. It's more obsession and a need to be noticed. In fact, these people require more attention than their mutts do.",1016236800,,2617,4.77924944812362

Former SCTV co-stars Catherine 'O' Hara and Eugene Levy(who co-wrote with Guest)appear as a couple with the wife running into a number of old sexual partners. Another is the great Michael McKean as part of a gay couple. I can't remember the other guy's name. Then you have Jennifer Coolidge(American Pie, Legally Blonde)as a rich blonde and her rather butch-ish dog handler(Played by Jane Lynch). Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock play a yuppy-ish couple who go to therapy because they think their dog has been damaged by seeing them have sex. And, finally, the last person is Guest himself. He plays Harlan Pepper, a southerner with a deep accent who also longs to be a ventriloquist. Very rich and well developed characters. As I've mentioned, the film is done in the 'documentary' style. Not everybody goes for that. I find it to be refreshing and funny. ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" is another ""mockumentary"" favorite of mine. Guest is no doubt a comedy genius. He has an incredible knack for finding the funny in incredibly unfunny things. He is a master. Catherine 'O' Hara's running joke about running into old sex partners could've been used to exhaustion, but thankfully, the makers only had it happen three times, so it doesn't lose the humor. Alas, I have saved the best for last. I'm talking about the great Fred Willard. How great is this man?. He's been around forever always doing a good job. This guy was perfect as the dog show announcer who just blurts out rather odd and hilarious dialogue throughout the show. Hilarious. Other familiar faces here are Ed Begley Jr., and comedian Larry Miller. This style of film and comedy doesn't float everyone's boat, but it should. One simply can't wait for what Guest has in store for us next.",1015977600,7,2218,4.917333333333334

Based on dog shows, this documentary follows several individuals and couples as they prepare to go to the big show. There is an apparent script, but much of it is ad-libbed, and the actors do such a good job of it. Every scene is filled with laughs. And if watching the entire movie isn't enough, there are about 30 deleted scenes that are just as funny, but that might not've fit the feeling of the film as a whole.

1417445,3,B00005ALS0,"You might think that the audience most likely to appreciate 'Best In Show' - a mockumentary following the fortunes of various owners who have entered their mutts in the Mayflower Dog Show, Philadelphia - would be dog-lovers.  It is these, however, who are likely to be most disappointed.  Just as historians cannot enjoy films like 'Elizabeth' because Francis Walsingham WASN'T wearing a chestnut buskin in his interview with the Queen on the 15th of October, 1572, so dog-owners will wonder why the realities of dogs - toilet problems; rolling over for rubs; the wide-eyed expectancy; the cunning gamesmanship; the shameless expeditions for 'perfume'; the talkative yawns; the curious sniffing of admirers; the yearning whimpers; the frank demands for your food etc. - are absent.  This is because the film's focus is firmly on the largely psychotic 'handlers', whose mania for success has turned animals they are supposed to love into over-trained automatons.  When the depressed Weimaraner, bullied and shrieked at by his appalling owners, finally lashes out and deliberately loses the contest for them, you can only cheer.
'Best in Show' is very much a film of two halves.  The first shows the owvers preparing for and travelling to the show.  Here the (improvised) material is content to settle for lazy caricature, and it is up to some amazing comedians - including 'Spinal Tap' veterans Christopher Guest and Michael McKean; Catherine O'Hara; co-writer Eugene Levy - to enliven it.
The second half, at the dog show itself, is superb.  This is because an unimaginative formal device - the use of commentators to explain the mechanics of these shows - turns out to be an inspired comic coup.  Fred Willard is a delightfully crass and bemused showman, stating the obvious and puerile with scatalogical glee, suggesting... improvements (bloodhounds should where deerstalkers and pipes a la Sherlock Holmes!); his squirming, English co-commentator, a dog expert with a string of Obedience Schools tries in vain to restore sobriety to the reportage.  The straight man/vulgar buffoon double act is hysterical in its own right, and galvanises the main narrative, their commentary on it making the handlers' activities hilarious.
'Best In Show' could never hope to equal 'Spinal Tap'.  Not only is the material not as funny, nor does the caricatured narrative arc allow the unexpected poignancy of the first film, but dog shows, a marginal activity, simply don't have the enormous cultural and emotional cache of rock music, which really does teeter on the brink of sublimity and ridiculousness.  With a brisk running time, though, 'Best In Show' is a likable minor work.",1012348800,8,2669,5.198135198135198
1417446,4,B00005ALS0,"Like his own ""Waiting for Guffman"" before, and the grandaddy of all mockumentaries, ""This is Spinal Tap"", ""Best in Show"" takes us ""behind the scenes"" and into the lives of some truly unique, oddball characters.  In this case, the event is a regional dog show, and the cast of characters are eerily like alot of people we know - our friends and neighbors who actually LOOK like their dogs and drive stationwagons.  You know the kind.
We get wrapped up in homey melodramas that evoke laughter, but also a perverse melancholy that allows us to think about ""what's really important.""  More so now - post September 11th - than ever, these themes sound hollow and dull, and the movie can seem frivilous at times.  But - give it a chance, and you'll find yourself attracted to this actor or that one - this is ensemble acting at its best (though not better than Guffman.)
Guest has an uncanny ability of  bringing out resonant human qualities from his actors and characters.  Instead of feeling sorry for them, we root for our favorites, warts and all.  In the process, we laugh away what's trivial and recognize the depth that can exist in every life. No matter how simple or trivial - life is grand!  The actors are uniformly terrific, under Guest's direction.  ""Guffman"" outshines ""Best In Show"" due to a spontaneous quality that's missing here (we're all pretty much familiar with dog shows, but Guffman goes where few of us have gone before - Community Theater!  Now THAT's priceless...)  Still, ""Show"" is a funny delight, with effervescent moments.",1012262400,,1547,4.7781954887218046

I almost hate to recommend comedies--even to people I know fairly well--because they almost always seem to get back to you with ""what-was-so-funny-about-that"" type comments.  It works both ways, though, I still wonder at all the people who recommended SOMETHING ABOUT MARY to me as though it would be just my cup of comedy.  I laughed maybe twice.
But I loved this movie.  It's not that I know that much about the world of dog shows--although I did go to a cat show once and found it truly bizarre.  The characters in Christopher Guest's ""mockumentary"" range from the quirky to the truly outlandish, but they're all very recognizable types, played to perfection by a cast of SCTV, SNL and indie vets.
It's nice to see such talented comedians as Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Guest himself in a vehicle worthy of their talents. Fred Ward is perfection as the know-nothing TV commentator.  And as for Jane Lynch, John Michael Higgins and Jennifer Coolidge, well, where have they been hiding? (Don't say the closet, PUH-LEEZE!)  This is not outrageous, gross-out humor.  But for those who like something a little more understated, ""Best in Show"" is hard to beat.
The additional 15 minutes of out-takes in the VHS and DVD formats provide a little added value, but actually serve as proof positive that the theatrical version movie was very well edited. The extra scenes all have their moments, but they also seem to fall flat in some ways. (We really don't need another scene with Harlan Pepper doing his ventriloquist act.)  The excised scenes demonstrate that less is indeed more.

Buy this movie if you loved Chris Kattan in The House on Haunted Hill. Buy this movie if you loved Rhys Ifans in....... anything. Because, if you love scene stealers, then this is the perfect comedy for you. Every single piece of precious celluloid is absolutely caked in scene stealing performances that most directors throw in as a way to cover up imperfections in plot, acting etc. But Christopher Guest (director/writer) has based his entire movie around these types of performences. This very underrated comedy is packed to the brim with both proven and virgin improv' geniuses. Think Christopher Guest (The Princess Bride, This is Spinal Tap), Eugene Levy (American Pie 1 & 2, Cannonball Run), Jennifer Cooliage (M.I.L.F from American Pie), Parker Posey (Scream 3), Fred Willard (Waiting for Guffman), Michael McKean, (This is Spinal Tap, Airheads), and the brilliant John Michael Higgins whom I've never seen before now, but has certainly made a lasting impression on me.
So, what's the plot? Quite simply-- a dog show and all the wonderfully quirky characters that come with it. That's it. Blood isn't spilt. Guns aren't fired. Cars don't chase. Nothing slightly rivetting happens. The characters travel to the dog show and compete. Nothing more. But rest assured you will be rivetted, waiting impatiently for the next histerical classic moment to jump out at you. And trust me, there isn't much of a wait. In fact there isn't a dull moment in this gem from beginning to end. And don't think for a second that the laughs end with the closing credits for owners of the DVD are in for a treat with deleted scenes aplenty.

There are laugh-out-loud lines, brilliantly wry and deadpan deliveries by an ensemble cast of gifted comedic improvisers, and characters served up with irony, but also with warmth.  This last is what makes the film endearing beyond being one of the funniest films in a long while.  Guest & Co. love these characters and the performances, while absurd, do not demean or debase these people.  There is great affection for their nutty pursuits.
It may have been mostly improvised and not scripted, but it holds up better than most scripts after they have been hammered by a dozen different writers.

""Guffman"" had interestingly flawed characters, as does ""Show"" (although the ""Show"" characters are just more obnoxious than anything else), and the moments they created and the world they exhibited seemed more poignant and colored more broadly than in ""Show"".
The Catherine O'Hara character was just a lame one-joke thing repeating through the movie, and the other main characters had little more to offer. Fred Ward as the dog show announcer was amusing at times, and obviously the funniest part of the film, but unfortunately that's not saying much, and it wasn't as if it was a real side-splitting kind of thing. Actually, my favorite part of the film was watching Ward's British counterpart react to him, and the two announcers together were a good part of the film. But as a whole, it was pretty weak, crude, and quite a disappointment. I'd still be interested to see the outtakes on the DVD. Maybe there's some funny bits in there, but then again, if that stuff didn't even make the movie, then probably not.",996105600,,1695,4.848275862068966
1417513,4,B00005ALS0,"Sly humor in another vein is finely tuned in Christopher (""This Is Spinal Tap"" and ""Waiting for Guffman"") Guest's ""BEST IN SHOW."" Writer-director Guest and his fearless ensemble players zero in on the animals and humans who dwell in the strange subculture of competitive dog shows. Almost documentary -- or should I say ""dogumentary""? -- in style, this largely improvised, sustained farce follows a clique of dog owners as they enter their animals in a national competition. You may not laugh out loud, but you will certainly smile and possibly even chortle at the eccentric dog owners. There's Parker Posey and Mike Hitchcock, a tightly-wound, pretentious yuppie couple who think they've traumatized their Weimeraner when they had sex in front of him.  Co-writer Eugene Levy is a Terrier owner and amazingly tolerant husband to Catherine O'Hara and her prodigious sleep-around past.  Guest is a loquacious, ventriloquist-aspiring and literally red-necked owner of a sardonically-faced Bloodhound.  Fred Willard steals the show as a naive -- and painfully inappropriate -- ad-libbing announcer. This is a sweet movie that holds an affectionate mirror to absurd human behavior in a ridiculous setting.  Animal lovers rest assured, there are no jokes at any dog's expense.

Other than tagging it a mockumentary, in the terminology inspired by this film's creator's earlier work THIS IS SPINAL TAP, or, as others have called it, a dogumentary, it defies categorization.  That alone is an extravagance in this era of haute conformity.  Essentially, Christopher Guest takes a sharply satirical yet ultimately not unkind look at the human behavior behind the Olympics of the dog show circuit. Christopher Guest must have watched the Westminster Show and has wondered, as I have, about Joe Garagiola (spelling?) as co-anchor.  Fred Willard does a wonderful send up.  This film features a dream ensemble of characters and actors.  The combination of writing and improvisation is seamless.  The dogs are treated with respect--there are no gags at their expense.

Overall, the movie is pretty amusing, and there are moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity, but the scattershot humor becomes constant the moment Mr. Willard appears.

1417545,4,B00005ALS0,"This movie is hysterical - every bit as good as everyone who saw it before me said it would be. And it's even better when you consider that this fake documentary was essentially unscripted - I didn't know this until about halfway through, myself. Christopher Guest (the mastermind behind This Is Spinal Tap) seems to have just kind of told everyone who their characters were and set some guidelines as to where he wanted them to go and then let them improvise the rest. It works pretty well, too, the vast majority of the time.
At first I was a little worried - the opening sequence in which all the main sets of characters are introduced is a bit dodgy. But it can't be helped, those scenes set the stage for everything that comes later. Once you've got a handle on who these people are, the hilarity is essentially non-stop. No-one gets spared: Gays, white trash, gold-diggers, yuppies, colour commentators... they all get lampooned - one or more of them is bound to remind you of someone you know, that's for sure!
I think my favourite characters were the overwrought yuppie couple (Parker Posey is especially good, as always). Others will doubtless choose the gay couple, since John Michael Higgins' Scott is one of the funnier send-ups of a flamboyant gay man in recent memory. Fred Willard's clueless announcer is exasperating and hilarious by turns. And, of course, everyone gets plenty of laughs out of Cookie's promiscuous past! I especially enjoyed the general theme of parodying people who take themselves just a bit too seriously.
The DVD doesn't have a whole lot of extras, but those it has are well-suited to the film. Director commentary is a must here, as are the deleted scenes. There's also a bit about dog owners, which rounds it out nicely.

But never does Guest, as director, take potshots at his characters and try to create cheap humour at their expense. Rather, he reveals some of the unpretty underbelly of the contest world (this time it's dog shows) and allows the audience to reach its own conclusions.
As in Waiting for Guffman, we're presented with a panoply of exotics and neurotics and allowed to watch them (and their doggies) try to win the top prize (in Guffman, it was a shot at Broadway.)

The comedy here is subtle (if you're looking for Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider humor, look elsewhere). Don't get me wrong; if you get the humor you WILL laugh out loud. The genius of Christopher Guest and his troupe of actors (which include the brilliant Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Michael Hitchcock and the Oscar-overlooked Fred Willard) is that they inhabit these people so completely because they know people like this EXIST. They put a satirical spin on them, but these people are types, not stereotypes and that makes the humor so much more satisfying.

Written by Spinal Tap creator Christopher Guest and SCTV's Eugene Levy, Best In Show takes a similarly wry yet loving look at the culture of amateur dog shows.
As with This Is Spinal Tap, the dog show world is merely a backdrop against which the cast improvises a wild variety of characters: a pair of neurotic yuppies who met in a Starbuck's, a trophy wife and her trainer ""friend,"" a gay couple comprised of polar opposites - all these people would be funny enough by themselves, but against the surreal seriousness of dog showmanship they are totally hilarious. This is one of those movies where two days later you're boring people at work by repeating lines from the movie.
Best In Show really has benefitted from the experience gained during Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman, keeping a real tight comedic pace using editing - in a film where the dialog is mostly improvised, Guest uses cuts to eliminate some of the lags in between stellar comedic bits. It therefore watches as if the whole thing were carefully orchestrated and scripted, not slowing down a bit.
I'm tempted to say that some people won't ""get"" Best In Show, but I really don't see how - it's paced well, it's performed well, the comedy is not mean-spirited or nasty, it's just plain funny, funny, funny.

Guest is responsible, or partly responsible, for ""This Is Spinal Tap"" (co-written by Guest) and ""Waiting for Guffman"" (co-written and directed by Guest), two films that have set lofty standards that all 'mockumentaries' strive for.  Alas, Guest does not achieve a perfect 3 for 3 as his latest film does not reach the rarefied heights attained by his previous projects.  However, this is a close miss and Guest should still be applauded for being consistently funny.  What made the previous films better was that Guest took perfectly realistic and believable situations and characters and gave them a slight comic twist.  Yes, we laughed at the people in those films but we also recognized in them a little of ourselves or of other actual people we know.  This time around, Guest seems to have shed his subtlety and decided to go over-the-top with the comedy.  This is especially evident in his characterizations of the yuppie couple and the gay couple.  Fred Willard, despite being gut-bustingly hilarious as the clueless sportscaster, has lines that are not even halfway believable.  And when the characters were subtle, such as Guest's Harlan Pepper, they run into the problem of not being funny.  Compare Harlan Pepper to Waiting For Guffman's equivalent -- Parker Posey's Libby Mae Brown -- and it's clear that Guest fell short this time around.  ""This is Spinal Tap"" and ""Waiting For Guffman"" were able to maintain, albeit precariously, the belief that these characters could be real, that we could run into them if we were heavy metal concert promoters or hick-town pageant directors.

The DVD adds a Director's commentary that helps the viewer identify the actors from the genuine dog show participants.

Assembling the same cast he used in ""Waiting for Guffman,"" Guest turns 'em loose to create the scenes without much scripting, and with this group of talented improv players, it works pretty well.  Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock as the lawyer-couple whose manic neuroses and screaming hissy fits turn their weimeraner into a total basket case (THEY think it's because their beloved Beatrice happened to see them ...) are completely over the top, but it actually works.

The film polks fun at Dog Shows(one event in which it's participants take itself WAAAAAAAAAY too serious).  This is best displayed when Fred Willard, playing a commentator for the show, asks his partner if he could guess how much Fred benched in his prime.  Also to mention his hilarious anecdote for dressing up a bloodhound in a Sherlock Holmes uniform, in order to ""get the crowd pumped"".
I liked this movie, and anyone a fan of mellow humor, rather than gross-out humor(Farrely Bros, etc.) should check this out.  It's more of a comedy for people in their 30's and up, but I'm 15, and got a tremendous kick out of it.  I won't touch down on the characters, because I'm sure you've read plenty on that already.  But, if your in the mood for one hell of a comedy, or just a plain old Fred Willard fan like myself, this is definitely worth a view.",989884800,45,1213,4.506849315068493

1417628,3,B00005ALS0,"Maybe I went in with unreasonable expectations...Waiting for Guffman, a movie that shares essentially the same cast & writers as Best in Show, is one of the absolute funniest comedies ever. This second effort, though laugh-out-loud funny in parts, just doesnt reach that same plateau. It could be that too many sub-par scenes had to be added to the movie to give it a feature film length. Too much screen time is given to the hotel manager & dog-show organizer, leading to large stretches of film devoid of comedy.  Dont get me wrong, parts of this movie really fly! Christopher Guest & Eugene Levyy are brilliant. Catherine O'Hara does excellent work as well. As has been written by other reviewers, Fred Willard steals the show. And many other actors have their moment to shine, too. It just doesnt sustain that high level throughout the entire movie. I would encourage anyone to rent this movie before buying, to see if it meets their expectations. Its good, but its no Guffman.",989798400,,981,4.804733727810651
1417629,3,B00005ALS0,"***1/2  Comedies come in many different shapes and forms.  Some, like Eddie Murphy vehicles, feature a main character who is demonstrably more intelligent than any once else around him, so we, in the audience, get to feel superior right along with him.  We actually derive comic pleasure out of flaunting that superiority.  Another type of comedy is one in which the audience is made to feel superior to EVERYONE on screen.  This is the category into which Christopher Guest's clever and zany mockumentaries, ""Waiting for Guffman"" and now ""Best of Show,"" belong.
So how does Guest manage to pull off this delicate high wire act of making us feel better than the characters on screen yet not having the movie slide over into cruelty and sadism?  Quite simply, he makes us see ourselves in the characters at the very same time we are laughing at them.  As a shrewd observer of human nature, Guest casts a scathing, yet at the same time utterly affectionate, eye on the bizarre rituals of small town Middle America.  In the case of ""Best in Show,"" Guest opens up to us the strange milieu of dog show competitions and the people involved in them.  As in ""Waiting For Guffman,"" he has assembled a cast of lovably eccentric characters to both act out the little dramas of their lives and address the audience directly in the form of mock interviews.  There is no point in reiterating the specifics of the many colorful characters whose lives we follow in the course of the film.  Those you can check out for yourself.  Suffice it to say that Guest makes us see many of our own obsessions, peculiarities and insecurities reflected in these people.  True, competitive dog shows may not be our own particular cup of tea, but we all fixate on SOMETHING that the rest of the world seems ignorantly unwilling to understand, something we may hide from our fellow men simply because they will not ""get it.""  ""Best in Show"" lets us laugh at ourselves without our having to reveal our own personal sore spot.
The large and superb cast is called upon to hit just the right comic note, ranging from subtle pathos to over-the-top absurdity - and it is a challenge the actors meet with flying colors.  Perhaps to demonstrate his egalitarian spirit, Guest gives some of his funniest bits to Fred Willard as a show announcer who has not a clue as to the finer points of the competition.  As the one person not initiated into the mysteries of the proceedings, Willard's character seems more out of touch than the eccentrics who get it all.
On the laugh meter, ""Best of Show"" doesn't rate quite as high as ""Waiting For Guffman.""  But for its moments of homespun cleverness and charm, it is definitely a comedy well worth checking out for yourself.  ""Best in Show"" indeed!",989712000,3,2747,4.675675675675675
1417630,5,B00005ALS0,"Although this isn't as cultish as ""This Is Spinal Tap"" or as laugh-out-loud-funny as ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best In Show"" once again showcases Christopher Guest's brilliance as a writer/director of ""mock-umentaries,"" as well as his impeccable taste in assembling the perfect cast.  Guest takes the least-showy role of soft spoken Southerner, Harlan Pepper (a far cry from Guffman's flamboyant Corky St. Clair), and surrounds himself with the likes of Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy as a woman with a dubious sexual past and her hapless husband; Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock as a strident yuppie couple who tear into one another mercilessly over what's best for their beloved dog; Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins as a middle class gay couple who sing their dog lullabyes over the phone; and the hilarious Jennifer Coolidge (in a send-up of Anna Nicole Smith) as a vapid fortune hunter married to an ancient millionaire while maintaining a curiously close relationship with their dog trainer played by Jane Lynch.  The movie has a gentle, lilting feel, humorous but not screamingly funny, and takes time to develop these characters fully while exploring the tense and cut-throat world of dog shows.  Fred Willard nearly steals the show as a pompous, ignorant commentator.  There are so many wonderful moments in this film, you have to check it out for yourself.  Not for everyone, I'm sure.  The story is fairly basic and, like Guest's other films, this is more a character study than anything else.  If you're a fan of his earlier work, this is a must-see.",989193600,35,1572,5.046332046332046
1417631,3,B00005ALS0,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie a great deal, but it just didn't have the comic punch I was expecting.  I walked into it thinking I was going to be seeing a Spinal Tap about the dog show world, but the improv and writing just wasn't up to that grade.  There were some great stand out performances, especially Fred Willard who was hilarious as the announcer.  But overall the movie didn't gel correctly.  I think Christopher Guest needs to get back with the boys from Tap to learn how to make a good mockumentary",989193600,,520,4.385416666666667

I did ( It's amazing how cinemas give distinctly average films repeated showings, and squeeze a gem like this on at about 11:00pm on a monday night)Anyway this is brilliant stuff. It's natural to be wary of a premise like this. A film about a dog show, eh, hmm. It would usually be a variety of ""ahhhh cute ikkle doggies"" performing a variety of human emotions. Of course with the inevitable love story ( both human and canine). But is it? Hell no it's a subtle poke at some overly doting dog lovers, with great casting and a hilarious script. This film falls into the ever rarer category of actually being better than your expectations. I kid you not, at the cinema I was at people were crying with laughter and rolling about in the aisles. One man was pretty much laughing from start to finish. He must of missed every second joke trying to recover from then one before. This is something special.",988761600,17,959,4.448863636363637

Actually, it was funnier the second time, because then you get all the little nuances you may have missed the first time around.  This could be the sleeper of 2000.  I found it to be really funny and if you have EVER seen even 15 minutes of a dog show, this movie is a MUST.  I recommend it highly for any age group over the age of 13.

1417655,5,B00005ALS0,"My wife and I found that we had a night to ourselves so we decided to go see a movie.  I'm not much of a fan of Hollywood these days and when we got to the Mega-Googaplex Cinema 5000 (1000 theaters in one place), it looked like a night of shopping would be more fun.  None of the choice of movies looked good.  But then we saw the marquee for ""Best in Show"" and saw that Eugene Levy was in it.  I like him so we decided to go in and watch the show.  I'm not a fan of dogs or dog shows and I have known folks in that business. They don't consider it a business - they consider it a ""passion"" or a ""love for the breed"" (or any other platitude you wish to insert here).  When the movie started, it was entertaining from beginning to end.  I love the fake documentary type films (such as Zelig, The Last Polka, Take the Money and Run etc.) and this fits perfectly into that genre. What a funny movie.  It's not the fall down laughing type of funny, just the entertaining type of funny.  The characters are classic.  I recognized a lot of types that I have known over the years.  Fred Willard was great as the ""play by play"" announcer of the dog show, and the cast in this film was perfect.  All did very well.
If you have ever watched a real dog show you will see that Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy did an excellent job of research before writing this movie.  They've captured the essence of dog shows in a humorous and entertaining fashion.  They hit the bullseye with this film.  After I watched this movie, I did purchase ""Waiting for Guffman""; a movie poking fun at Community Theater, and found that it was similar in style as Best in Show. It's the same cast of characters.  I guess part of my love for both of those films is that I love watching movies that poke fun at pompous, self-important, egotistical little folks who don't recognize their diminutive stature.  One of the reasons I love Groucho Marx so much was his ability to deflate the biggest ego with a quick witty barb.  And if you have ever known dog show people or community theater sorts, you will really appreciate how sharp the barbs are in these movies.  Neither film is politically correct, which is all the more reason to enjoy them.
If you like the fake documentary style of movie, you will love this film.  If you don't like those types of films, then this isn't the film for you.  If you've never seen one of those types of films, but like Eugene Levy then give this one a try.  You should find it very entertaining.",987724800,14,2495,4.263829787234043

1417657,5,B00005ALS0,"After hunting to find a cinema showing ""Best In Show"" in the UK my friend and I tracked it down to a fleepit in Richmond just outside london. However it was worth the trip. What Guest has done is craft a small comic masterpiece. This film should be seen by any budding actors as it is a fantastic masterclass in comic acting. Showing that you don't have to be over the top to be funny, humour can bee found in the smallest places. The way people talk to each other in this film is at once funny yet totally beleivable. It's a testament to the cast and filmakers that it keeps the feel of a Documentary all the way through and never falls into using normal dramatic movie conventions at any time. I'm sure if you put someone in front of it that had never heard of Guest or any of the other actors and knew nothing of the film, they would think it was a genuine expose on the Dog Show community. All in all a wonderful film that will probably not get the attention and praise that it deserves.",985046400,14,991,4.193717277486911
1417658,5,B00005ALS0,"This is one of the few comedies of last year that actually sticks out. This is a movie that suceeds only because it is subtle in its ways. It does not go all out for laughs, but instead has intelligent jokes and running gags that make it what it is. This film was overlooked by many people because it was not a major release, and because it did not have any ""major"" stars. This is a film that many people missed out on.
The real comedy comes from the great script and the excellent directing abilities of Christopher Guest. All of the essential comedic aspects are here, a great script, a director that does not go for the cheap laughs, and an incredible cast. There are many characters, and a few major plot lines, and all but one of them work. The plot with the lesbians falls a little flat, but Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara more than make up for their mistakes.
This film suceeds on more than one level. It is intelligent, and it will make you laugh. This is a rare feat for most films today. Most of them go for the cheap laugh and any simpleton can find the humor in those movies. This one goes for a little more intelligent laughs, and suceeds.
