7969689,4,B00006IUN6,"If you ever want to see the closest thing to legal public debauchery, go to New Orleans during Mardi Gras. While the authorities of the town claim to try to crack down on public nudity, they still know it is one of the main draws to the festival. I have been there, seen it, and can testify that girls really do go wild in this situation. Young females, who are probably staid and reserved back at home do things you wouldn't imagine with just a flash of some beads.
Or in this case, a video camera. The makers of these videos have once again captured what they do best. In the case of Mardi Gras, it's like shooting fish in a barrel. What they advertise is outrageous, but in this case, they do deliver.
One warning, though. The ""Girls Gone Wild"" franchise has done what it does very well. They basically get drunk girls in party situations to take their clothes off in public. If you've seen one of their videos, you've seen them all. I highly endorse getting ONE if this is your thing, but that's where the warning comes in.
Once the company gets your credit card number, they put you on an automatic mailing list. You start receiving more of their collection, and the box has no invoice, just the tape. If this happens to you, look carefully at your next credit card bill. You may have gotten the first one at a bargain price via those seductive TV ads, but they charge full price (around [amount of money] each) for each of those.
You also have to research the web site on the box to find return information. If you don't do it within 30 days, you're sunk. When you do call to cancel, you get a hard sell to buy more products, and you have to insist to get taken off the list.
It's too bad this business practice leaves such a bad taste in your mouth, as the product is pretty good. So enjoy, but be careful.",1038787200,2,1813,4.288629737609329
