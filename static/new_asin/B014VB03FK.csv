7424907,5,B014VB03FK,"Neatly packaged. The box is pretty good quality, thick cardboard. The case holding the disks is well decorated as well. The lighter and dog tag are well made too. Not super fancy, but not cheap either. Can't think of any drawbacks. Great product, would buy again.",1454198400,,263,4.739130434782608
7424908,5,B014VB03FK,Excellent Collection! Only wish the series came in a legitimate ammo container but then again the price would've easily been doubled!,1452816000,,133,5.380952380952381

7424911,5,B014VB03FK,The Black Lagoon Premium Edition is a great product for a fan of the series who didint buy the other blu Ray/DVDs.,1450051200,,114,4.2272727272727275
7424912,5,B014VB03FK,"If you love the Black Lagoon Series, this box set is the ideal way to collect it! The Blu-Ray quality is perhaps a little overkill, but leaves nothing to be desired. Great sound quality on the disc, the disc box has amazing character art, and the small art booklet is fun to have on the side. The dog tag and lighter are nice  touches, except I don't wear necklaces nor smoke... so they're to be treated more as novelties.
The box is super nice, designed as a Korean War-era ammunition box - and man the contents pack a punch! Re-watching Black Lagoon from this box set was utterly enjoyable, and I can only say: Get It!",1471046400,2,620,4.344827586206897

7424914,4,B014VB03FK,"Black Lagoon is actually an Amazing Show - Definitely watch it.  All those 5-star review are spot-on.  Great story, art work, dialog, and characters.

UPDATED ----- Be careful buying.
I bought this item and returned it twice twice!  Both times this has arrived opened (not sealed), packaging damaged, scratched discs, bent/folded art book, with the dog tags and lighter stolen.  The third time I ordered it finally came sealed, with everything is great shape.  I don't know if I got the two unlucky pulls, or if (after complaining a lot,) Amazon finally sent me a legit copy.  It's hard to know what happens in the warehouses spread out all over the place, so these things are bound to occur. First time was tolerable, the second bad shipment was livid. The anxiety when the 3rd package arrived was pretty high, but it turned out to be fine, as it came sealed, whole, and complete.

5 stars for the show
1 star for the mess I had to go through
3 stars to split the difference
+1 star because Amazon is fast at responding and gets it right in the end.",1469750400,10,1050,4.518518518518518
7424915,5,B014VB03FK,"My daughter is a big fan of this manga, she would highly recommend the Premium Edition to everyone.

7424917,5,B014VB03FK,"Such a fantastic series. I got half way done on hulu and decided that this is a must see on blu ray. Other than the series being awesome, the packaging is awesome too! You get a great blu ray case along with a full colored artbook, also comes with a dog tag and a neat lighter, I don't smoke but it is a pretty neat addition to have. If you enjoyed Black Lagoon in the least bit then this is a great buy!",1459900800,3,404,3.8795180722891565

8731947,5,B014VB03FK,"Loved the anime, so I am going to keep it as part of my collection, rather than watching it from these Blu-Ray discs. As such, these 5 stars are more for the anime than the physical edition. The box is compact and feels well-built, though.",1510876800,,239,4.333333333333333

8731953,4,B014VB03FK,"Nicely Packaged and arrived on time! Fairly priced considering how much the Dvds cost alone. Would recommend if you are a fan of the series. The only problem I had was that the lighter did not work. It really does not bother me much since I planned to have it as more of a collectors item than actual use but still, it would have been nice if it worked. Overall I still loved it.",1476057600,,379,4.135135135135135
