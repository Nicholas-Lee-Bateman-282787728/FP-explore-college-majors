8255403,5,B0014E916A,"Without question, Alice in the Cities is Wim Wenders best film. Rudiger Vogler as Philip Winter and Yella Rottlander as Alice are fantastic in their roles. The two of them carry the entire film on their shoulders and they do it perfectly. Yella Rottlander is amazing as Alice being both adorable and funny as she exchanges barbs with Rudiger Vogler.  This is the only major film in which she appeared but she does her role like a professional. The film jumps from New York City to Amsterdam to Germany with beautiful black and white photography from Wenders. In fact, in one scene near the start of the film at a snack bar where the Winter character is checking out his photos, the man at the juke box in the background is Wim Wenders himself in a cameo just like Alfred Hitchcock was famous for in his films. Films like this on DVD but in the non-USA format is the reason why I purchased a multi-region Blu-Ray/DVD player! I can't stress enough that anyone who experiences this film won't be disappointed.",1433030400,3,1006,4.588888888888889
