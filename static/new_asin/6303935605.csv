8362406,5,6303935605,"In my previous review I failed to offer insight as to why I found this particular video so captivating. What makes it unique is that guest artists from all over the world dance in selections featured in this video. This offers a rare opportunity to see dancers not trained in the Balanchine Technique interpret his choreography, coupled with NYCB dancers who are.
Stand outs to me: * the charismatic Susan Jaffe of ABT in Western Symphony * Darcey Bussell of the Royal Ballet who is amazingly flexible as she is graceful and is partnered well with the NYCB's Lindsay Fischer. This is in the famous pas de deux from ""Agon"". * Kathleen Tracey, an NYCB soloist shines (as does Zippora Karz) in another pas de deux from ""Agon"". Tracey's smile struck me as genuine and her finger placement made her hands look like stars (excuse me as I wax poetic). This is the selection that brought me to tears several times. * Wendy Whelan also in ""Agon"". Her strength and lyricism really is amazing. *Ronald Perry of Dance Theatre of Harlem in a selection from ""Who Cares?"" This is notable not only for his interprative style, but because DTOH was created and is run by Arthur Mitchell- a former principal dancer of the NYCB. *Damien Woetzal, principal dancer for NYCB, in ""Stars and Stripes"".His jumps look effortless.
 Finally the celebratory ending had me crying all over again. Another famous artist makes a surprise appearance which was very moving to me. I'll leave out who it was because I hope that whoever reads this will get the video and enjoy it as much as I do.",975196800,21,1557,4.661818181818182
