8650523,4,B00JFF4X2W,"I've only given this collection 4 stars instead of 5 because I haven't actually watched these discs, but have seen each of these films except Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  I'm reviewing this superb set because sadly nobody else has, and because I have details which Amazon's ""product updates"" page didn't give me the ability to add.  I'm listing these specifics per product packaging (if anything turns out to be inaccurate, blame them not me!).  These are the full versions of the films, each movie on its own disc, just like you'd get if you bought each title separately (though not special editions, of course).  I consider this an excellent value even at full list price, which I doubt anyone with even a modicum of savvy will ever pay.

I beg your forgiveness for poor grammar/punctuation to follow. . .I'm normally a stickler for such things, but I'm doing this review on a tablet and you ought to just be thankful for all this effort on my part!  :)
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral is widescreen 16x9, not rated, runs 122 minutes, and has no extras.  The Searchers is widescreen 16x9 1.85:1, not rated, runs 119 minutes, and includes an introduction by Patrick Wayne and a theatrical trailer.  (I also own a special edition of this movie, which I highly recommend if you dug it as much as I did.)  Shane is fullscreen 4x3, but it's such a great film you probably won't mind, not rated, runs 117 minutes, and features commentary with George Stevens Jr. and Ivan Moffat, and a theatrical trailer.  The Wild Bunch is widescreen 16x9 2.4:1, rated R (well-earned), runs 145 minutes, features commentary by Peckinpah Biographers/Documentarians Nick Redman, Paul Seydor, Garner Simmons and David Weddle, and a Peckinpah trailer gallery.",1452038400,4,1732,4.840677966101695
