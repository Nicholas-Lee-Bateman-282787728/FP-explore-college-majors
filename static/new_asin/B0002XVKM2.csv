2137274,1,B0002XVKM2,"I rented this movie (thankfully, a free rental) because I love Hallie Todd as an actress.  She's the only saving grace in the movie.  She's hysterical, and quite a departure from Jo McGuire.  The rest of the movie, YIKES!  It's definitely the lowest form of humour.  It has a great premise--uptown yuppie family visiting a family of hippies who are extremely backward.  However, it falls flat.  Unless you're a ""die hard"" National Lampoon's fan, skip this movie (or rent it as a free rental).  I rented it free, and still felt I paid too much (in gasoline!).",1125619200,2,558,4.680412371134021
2137275,1,B0002XVKM2,"UGH, i am sick of this whole ""national lampoon"" movie thing. The only truly funny laugh out loud, and hillarious National Lampoon movies are the VACATION SERIES, other than that all of them are just bogus and are so stupid they actually put you to sleep. I personally am i HUGE movie buff, and appriciate all sorts of movies, and am open and welcome to new ideas, but this is just ridiculous, how many movies are they going to make? and when are they going to stop? I found this to be more of a horror movie than a comedy. It tries so hard to be funny, but it fails miserably, even my cousin (who laughs at EVERYTHING) had to turn this off within 30 minutes, and it took many days for me to finnish the movie myself, i cant say exactly how long, but i had to watch it in incriments of i think 15 minutes each day, and from the second i started it, i was praying for the 15 minutes to be up! don't watch!!",1112227200,9,904,4.084269662921348
2137276,5,B0002XVKM2,"Before you ask the question, the answer is ""yes"".  I do spend a good portion of my free time watching movies...and the one I just finished watching was a side-splitter.

Any ""National Lampoon"" fans in the crowd?  If you enjoyed NL's ""Vacation"", ""Christmas Vacation"", ""European Vacation"" and ""Vegas Vacation"", you will love ""National Lampoon's Holiday Reunion"".  If you are a Baby Boomer (like me) you will warm up to this film quicker than a frog on a lily pad.  Then again, frog butts are mighty cold.

The scripting, casting and editing is seamless...even though I'm sure this was a cable TV product due to the pauses (where commercials could be inserted).

My dear friend Darlene would love it.  The lead characters remind me so much of our long lost friends...Mickey and Kitty.  That's between Darlene and I and I will not venture further.

Bottom line, this is a story of a big city family transplanted into the backwoods for a ""real"" family Thanksgiving.  Coming out of the city shell and into the country hell is handled so well I could not stop laughing.  What an enjoyable comedy.  Mature audiences (that means young adults, old adults and baby boomer and bloomers) will cuddle up to a piece of life that is often forgotten...overlooked...taken advantage of.

Here's a piece of the script.  I just had to write it down:

""I've been through every kind of weather and stormy seas; Now I do just what I want when I please. I'm only getting better like a vintage wine; And there's still a lot of livin' in this body of mine.""

In the National Lampoon genre', this one gets a solid 10.  Wanna have a good laugh?  Don't miss it...can you hear me Darlene?",1107561600,10,1657,4.651724137931034

8034322,1,B0002XVKM2,"Actually,I give no stars. This movie is so bad the viewer should be paid to watch it. Terrible script,acting not even at high school level. The story is inane,enough with the stoner movies. The days of  the Vacation movies over.",1417996800,2,228,4.7
8034323,1,B0002XVKM2,"I would like to know why they took thanksgiving out of this movie? This movie came on tv today, I was looking for thanksgiving movies as there are not many at all. So when I say the title I said this is going to be great comedy! I am a fan of National Lampoons movies, but this one left me disappointed.
What was the purpose of the doctor wearing a wig to be intimate with his wife, pure gross!!!
When this movies aired on tv today it aired as thanksgiving family reunion.
Not sure who thanksgiving offended or if the makers of this movie thought it would sell better without the word thanksgiving.
pass this one up.",1417046400,,616,4.273504273504273
