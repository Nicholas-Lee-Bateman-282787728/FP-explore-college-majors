7909791,4,B00000IBU6,My only complaint with this DVD is the viewing quality for the first half of the 1993 year was not as clear as the rest of the DVD.  I'm not as familiar with the different bull riders as some so I can't comment in that area.  I just like to watch those brave souls who ride and see their successes and failures.,1104105600,,311,4.0
