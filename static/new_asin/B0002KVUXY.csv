8028674,5,B0002KVUXY,I had to replace this for the library.  Worked great,1481587200,,52,4.2
8028675,4,B0002KVUXY,"This movie is VERY scary.  I got it from the library 4 years ago, when my kids were 3 and 5, and popped it in the player while I went to do something else.  Minutes later, they came running to me saying, ""IT'S TOO SCARY!!""  I was like, dude, what is your problem?  They were all, ""YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT WITH US!""  I was like, I cannot believe you.  Seriously, it's Hello Kitty Princess Dreams.  Get with the program.

So I watched it with them.  It was terrifying.  I still have nightmares about it.  And my now 9-year-old wants to see it again, because she's totally into scary stuff now.  The library no longer has it (gee, I wonder why they took it out of circulation?), so I'm ordering from Amazon.

If you have a 9-year-old who likes scary stuff and can appreciate the irony of a horror movie called Hello Kitty Princess Dreams, this is the movie for them.",1370304000,,860,4.267080745341615
8028676,5,B0002KVUXY,"it doesnttell you in the description that it only has 2 hello kitty episodes, there are 2 other episodes about a frog named keropi, its still cute but my daughter wasn't the happiest about it. after a few times of watching it though she now likes it and its good if you have a boy and a girl my son really likes keropi.",1297555200,,319,4.079365079365079
8028677,3,B0002KVUXY,"Hello Kitty & Friends: Princess Dreams is the fifth volume of DVDs released for Hello Kitty & Friends.  This disc features two stories starring Hello Kitty (""The Sleeping Princess"" and ""The Prince in His Dream Castle"") and two stories featuring Keroppi (""The Adventures of the Coward Prince"" and ""The Frog's Secret House"").  However, I am confused by the inclusion of ""The Frog's Secret House,"" since it doesn't fit into the ""princess dreams"" theme.

Admittedly, this is a rather ""low frills"" DVD.  When the disc is put into the DVD player, it goes straight to the first story after the Hello Kitty's Paradise promo, rather than to the main menu.  Also, the only ""special feature"" on the disc is the DVD credits.  While I would normally count the lack of special features against a DVD, I can't with this disc since it's being aimed at and marketed to young children.  With young children, special features aren't as important, since they won't sit still long enough to view them, anyway.  As an adult, I found the episodes to be enjoyable, and that the writing for the English dub was done in such a way that it wasn't talking down to the kids.

These Hello Kitty DVDs contain anime that's very friendly to young children, although girls will probably be more interested than boys.  If you have a young child at home and are looking for kid-friendly anime, then I would recommend the Hello Kitty & Friends DVDs.",1228176000,2,1412,4.726530612244898
8028678,4,B0002KVUXY,"For all of these people that wrote in to say it was ""too scary"" for their kids (what?!) I just want to put in my two cents.  This is the same Hello Kitty series that used to air on Toon Disney back in the mid 90s.  Its basically Hello Kitty and other Sanrio characters (such as Kerroppi and Pekkle) acting as the stars of famous fairy tales and stories such as Heidi, Snow White, Robin Hood, etc.  The stories are fairly watered down versions (especially compared to the original Brothers Grimm tales of these same stories - read the originals before claiming the darker bits are because of ""Japanimation"" - doh!)

No blood is shed, there's little violence.  Its the same stuff you have seen before.  Cinderella still has the cruel step sisters and the fairy godmother that waves her wand and makes magic for Hello Kitty as Cinderella on the night of the ball, etc.  These stories are not too scary for children, they are the same ones we've seen a million times, just acted out by Sanrio properties this time.

Im giving it four stars because the transfer is absolutely atrocious.  I don't know what master this came from but the screen is constantly shaky like someone holding a handcam and the colours are dreadfully washed out.  There was obviously no attempt to clean this up.... other than that its good clean fun and nice presentations of the fairy tales.",1182038400,2,1362,4.590909090909091
8028679,5,B0002KVUXY,"I have to disagree with all the parents that left reviews for this video, stating that it was ""inappropriate"" for young children. While it does contain some suspense and ""scary"" images (arguably comparable to those of such children's classics as Snow White), it was far more enjoyable and memorable to me as a young child than the brainlessly cheerful kid's movies that over-protective parents love to expose their children to.

Renting this movie every couple weeks was the highlight of my LIFE as a five year-old, and I'm so grateful that I was able to track down such a beloved part of my (non-dysfunctional) childhood. 5 STARS!",1163808000,2,631,4.897196261682243
8028680,1,B0002KVUXY,"Totally agree with the other reviewers - this video is way too scary for anyone younger than elementary school.  It has dark themes, with vultures, laser shooting bats, swordfights and people turned into stone.  We had totally enjoyed some of the other Hello Kitty Paradise DVDs and came across this at Toys R Us.  Heed the warnings!",1151107200,,333,4.807017543859649
8028681,1,B0002KVUXY,This DVD is totally inappropriate for young children.  It is very scary.  This is defintitely for the older Hello Kitty Fan.  There should be a warning on the label.,1141776000,,165,4.620689655172414
8028682,2,B0002KVUXY,"I have purchased several of the Hello Kitty DVD/VHS selections for my children.  This one is inappropriate for preschoolers.  It is scary and has themes that are way too adult for this age group.  Hello Kitty is generally very cute, innocent, sweet, and full of good lessons.  This one is off of the beaten path for the usual Hello Kitty fair.  Don't fear buying your children Hello Kitty - just check the content ahead of time by reading reviews.  This one is definitely a leave alone video for the preschool set.",1134864000,,514,4.593406593406593
8028683,2,B0002KVUXY,"This is the first Hello Kitty show I've ever bought.  I have seen the products forever, the cute stationary, etc., but never knew about the DVDs.  I expected it to be cutesy, appropriate for my 2 1/2 year old.  I was truly surprised when I put this on, and it went from cutesy stuff to scary stuff that was very much in line with JapAnimation anime that I've seen bits of before that are not for the very young.  I turned it off when my husband pointed out to a busy me that it didn't look too appropriate.  Later we put it on after she went to bed.  We were craking up at how it went from super-cutesy stuff to the sweet kitties walking into the spooky forest, seeing a scary monster, etc.  Fairy tales can be on the spooky side, and I don't think these tales were watered down for preschoolers.  Maybe she'll like it when she's about 6-8, but it's not for her anytime soon when we're used to the innocence of Blues Clues, Kipper, and Caillou still.  I am so curious to know if the other Hello Kitties are only cutesy, or if they have this more spooky Japanimation stuff in it too.",1104278400,4,1082,4.213592233009709
