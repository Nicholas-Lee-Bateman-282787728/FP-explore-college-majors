8404349,1,B003SHDMWU,It's amateurish. The presenter can't pronounce right some sushi items. He didn't  know the name of a shellfish.

8404351,4,B003SHDMWU,"Good content, very well focused on culinary destinations.  The technical quality of the production is very amateurish which is why I removed a star.  It's like it was shot on a camcorder.  Plus at this point it's a bit dated, but still certainly worth watching if you're traveling to Tokyo.",1384819200,,290,4.76
