If you're getting mugged, simply break out the country roger rabbit and watch your muggers accept you as one of their own.

What goes together better than country and hip hop?  I don't know, you tell me!  Master these moves and break them out at that country bar in Compton or that hip hop place in Cheyenne, or heck, just challenge the local dance crew with this stuff!  I plan on breaking out the old boombox and doing some street dancing in Crenshaw this weekend.

Thank you Diane Horner!",1438041600,8,417,4.294871794871795

Before you waste your money, check out the clip of this video on the ""ifilm"" website. BTW, you *will* see mullets. (Oh *helllss* no!) Then go spend your money on a real hip hop video.

If you're a fan of hip-hop AND country music, you'll be ecstatic, as this charming video combines the two styles to SPECTACULAR effect. You may think that line dancing and hip hop don't go together, but don't tell Diane Horner that; she'll prove you wrong faster than you can say ""Holla!""",1017273600,21,363,4.2
