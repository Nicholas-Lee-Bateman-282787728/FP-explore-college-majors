1222565,5,B00000IBY8,"Whether you are a die hard Jackie fan or a passive visitor of the infinite Jackie video libraries you will find this ""documentary"" highly entertaining. This isn't a typical type of documentary because it features Jackie and his stunt crew showing off how the intricacies of their action sequences. It seems Jackie actually took the time to film this twice, one where he speaks his native language and another time where it is filmed in english. He didn't simply dub it, there are two sides to the DVD.
Pay attention as Jackie nails the camera while demonstrating how they use fake blood...what a pro!",1013212800,11,600,4.778846153846154
1222566,4,B00000IBY8,Excellent behind the scenes type video explaining and detailing everything you could want to know.  Too bad we don't get to see Chan do much execpt for when they show some of the greater moments from past movies. Get it!,1010534400,5,220,4.5

1222568,5,B00000IBY8,"I find myself constantly fascinated by this man, Jackie Chan.  He never ceases to amaze me.  Look how old he is and try to understand how he does what he does. He truly is a legend in the flesh.
This particular DVD is an excellent example of how Jackie makes his stunt driven movies.  He goes into fine detail on how he sets up the scenes and prepares for each of his breathtaking stunts.  It also gives you a little insight on Jackie's creative stunt team that have been black listed on the insurance market for doing what they do.  It shows that without them Jackie's stunts would never look as good as they do.  For me this DVD was a great ""HOW TO"" movie.  I myself make cheesy movies every now and again with friends and hope to someday make big budget movies, this DVD showed me how to perform some stunts with better protection and just made me think of new ways I can decieve the audience.  Mind you, don't go trying this stuff at home unless you are physically fit and mentally fit for it.
In the end I would have to say this is just another Jackie Chan movie that must be in your collection.  What's great is that there are two sides to the disc, one is English (yay!) and the other is Mandarin.  No subtitles here baby!  Buy it, buy it, buy it I say!  For Jackie Chan will never fail to entertain you.",982800000,9,1311,4.2
7910642,4,B00000IBY8,My Stunts consists of a series of show and tell revelations about how the stunts work (brilliantly) both physically and cinematically. Like 'My Story' Jackies warmth as an individual shines through and the action footage (including out-takes where it went wrong) is consistently amazing.,1505347200,2,287,5.545454545454546
7910643,5,B00000IBY8,One of the coolest DVD's I ever watched. I have much more admiration for Jackie Chan now! He is awesome!,1407801600,,104,4.25
7910644,5,B00000IBY8,"I love this video, I took it everyware and showed it to my friends and watch it soo many times, sadly I lost it in the process, now I want to buy another one. It IS that good.",1381881600,,175,3.6315789473684212
7910645,5,B00000IBY8,"If you're even a small fan of Jackie, you need to watch this.  If you're  fan of HK action movies, you need to see this.  You will gain so much respect for how Jackie Chan makes his stunts look so spectacular and effortless.  You will also come to see how unspectacular Hollywood stunt filming is after watching this.  Jackie Chan is a master of his craft!!!!",1310947200,,359,4.378787878787879
7910646,5,B00000IBY8,"I purchased this in April 2001 and still toss it in the DVD player 2-3 times a year. It's a fascinating look at how Jackie and his team put together great stunts and fight scenes for his movies.

If you're a Jackie Chan fan, you will enjoy this!",1280016000,,245,4.104166666666667
7910647,5,B00000IBY8,Sharing all secrets and still impresive. Even the best effects don't make stunts look as real as Jackie and his team does them.,1261958400,,127,4.565217391304348
7910648,5,B00000IBY8,"I must reflect the positives of most of the other reviews listed here.  Absolutely great to have explained and see how Mr. Chan does his stunt work. Someone broke into my garage and stole  my copy. I finally gave up and ordered a replacement. I admire these stuntmen as excellent athletes as well as actors. Their attention to detail and how much of the action steps they commit to memory also reminds me of how excellent dancers must remember long sequences in order to do what they do so well.
  I have several other stunt explaining movies, but none of them show on such a personal level what happens. This is a large part of what makes this movie unique. It focuses on the Jackie Chan stunts in his series of movies, not just car stunts, buildings blowing up, etc over many other peoples movies. I enjoy the focus being on the involvement of people (not just cars and objects) in this video.
  If you like Jackie Chan, enjoy his movies and are interested in how the stunts work behind the camera, I can't recommend this video enough!
  If you collect videos like this, you may have noticed it is no longer in print and the cost of used ones is really going up.  If you want one I would advise getting it now (if you can find it) and not waiting. You can also view clips of it on youtube, but I prefer to have it at home on the DVD and am a big fan of legally owned entertainment.
  Enjoy",1230940800,,1391,4.270992366412214
7910649,5,B00000IBY8,"I had my doubts about this movie/documentary but I really enjoyed watching all of the behind the scenes footage with his stunt team.  This dvd is really great because it explains how he does his action sequences and choreographs it with the stunt team he uses for many of his movies.  If you are any sort of a fan of Jackie Chan, then you MUST HAVE THIS DVD!!!  Don't think twice about it, just get it and you will be very pleased.",1198454400,,431,4.2317073170731705
7910650,5,B00000IBY8,"This DVD is wonderful.  Here Jackie takes you behind the scenes and demonstrates and explains how stunts and different special effects are done in his movies.  He also goes over the stunts scenes in several of his movies, and you get to meet his stunt crew.",1097884800,6,257,4.565217391304348
7910651,5,B00000IBY8,Sitting in awe of Jackie and this DVD.  That man is amazing.  A must have for any Jackie Chan fan.  Long live (and love) Jackie Chan!,1021420800,4,133,4.038461538461538
