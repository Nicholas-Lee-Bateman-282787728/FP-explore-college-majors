What a joke!  Thank goodness I watched this before showing it to my 10th grade economics class!

7864246,1,6304164912,"I am an Economics teacher.  I purchased this product used because I wanted a short video to supplement my unit on business decisions and entrepreneurship.  However, this is primarily a video on money management and investing.  Becoming a teenage entrepreneur was barely even mentioned - it tells the viewer to look in the workbook (that didn't come with my video).  Also, I agree with the prior review about the weird 80's style graphics - they were often distracting.  The concepts are very broad and would be suitable for high school, however the graphics and music are so dated they would likely only appeal to elementary school students.  I was quite disappointed by this video and would not recommend it.",1145577600,,709,4.915966386554622
