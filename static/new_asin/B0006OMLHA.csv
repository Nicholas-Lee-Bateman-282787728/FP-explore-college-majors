I have used these successfully to teach a full range of different concepts. I have taught many different grade levels (grades 2-6) and I can honestly say that these are the only videos I own that are appropriate for all ages. It doesn't seem to matter the age of the students for they are all spellbound watching these interesting and delightful videos. Older students are fascinated by the story of rickets and changing the formula to best meet the needs of the growing bears.  They view it with a more calculating, scientific eye.  With younger students we have explored the concept of the polar bears themselves and their special adaptations. For all students, they get a lesson in compassion by watching the heartwarming dedication of the zoo staff in their attempts to save the lives of the bears. I can't say enough about these wonderful documentaries!",1276905600,2,972,4.808383233532934
8042155,5,B0006OMLHA,"I first saw this show on TV when it came out and it made an unforgettable impression on me. It was touching, and if it were fiction could not have been plotted better. To watch these tiny cubs being rescued and reared by these incredible loving people, was an experience I haven't been able to forget. They are so adorable with distinct personalities you just fall in love with them. To realize after a while that you now also understand the sounds Klondike and Snow make and know what they are asking for is amazing. I have been searching for a copy of this since it first aired and am overjoyed to find I can now get a copy for my 5 year old granddaughter who loves animals so much. I highly recommend it for adults and children alike.",1133568000,9,737,4.309352517985611
8042156,5,B0006OMLHA,"I first saw this documentary by chance on PBS, and I was so amazed with the twin polar bear cubs' story of survival as well as taken by how adorable the cubs were that I became a local PBS member expressly so I could obtain a videotape of it.  And, unlike most of my videotape collection, I've actually rewatched this program (about 5 or 6 times).  Now, I'm on Amazon to find second and third (and fourth and fifth...) copies as gifts for my animal-loving friends as well as friends with children.  I highly recommend this documentary!",1108771200,8,535,4.494845360824742
8042157,5,B0006OMLHA,"Klondike and Snow - A Tale of Twin Polar Bears.  This is an excellent, heart-warming story which is best shared with your family and best friends.  The dedication of the staff of the Denver Zoo to these wonderful lives can be witnessed by the overwhelmingly powerful response shown by the citizens of Denver and the World in response to their being saved.  It's a story of courage, dedication, and commitment by the entire community. Your only disappointment will be the tape doesn't last for five or six more hours!",1106697600,4,516,4.775280898876405
