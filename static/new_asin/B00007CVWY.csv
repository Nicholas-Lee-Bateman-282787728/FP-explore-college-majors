1806086,5,B00007CVWY,"It is hard to believe that William H. Macy did not get an Oscar for his performance in this film.  The film tells the real life story of a door-to-door salesman named Bill Porter (Macy) who overcomes his challenges with cerebral palsy in order to become the company's most successful door-to-door salesman.  Having overcome physical challenges, the movie shows the human side of Bill Porter as it shows the wall of self-independence he has erected and the friendships he develops, and almost loses, as he allows others who care about him to help him and become a part of his life.
This movie is funny, heart-warming, and endearing thanks to what I consider the best performance from William H. Macy ever.  A must see movie!",1041984000,13,723,4.768

1806089,5,B00007CVWY,"I was on holiday from the uk to las vegas in July when this premiered on tv. It is without a doubt one of the best tv dramas i had ever seen. Bill macy is Bill Porter and if this was a movie he would get an oscar. I think I laughed many times and cried at least twice. I watch ed it twice before going home and since returning have always checked internet sites to see if its going to be released as a dvd, so i can import it to the uk as i don't think it will be on tv here.

1806090,5,B00007CVWY,"William H. Macy did a wonderful job of bringing forth the story of Bill Porter, a man with Cerebral Palsy, who sold Watkins products from ""Door to Door""... in fact, he was the last ""Door to Door"" salesman that Watkins had (when Watkins like most other Multi Level Marketing Companies started to go over to telephone ordering and the internet).  To find out more about Mr. Porter, you can visit his website ...  .  Knowing Mr. Porter, seeing this film with Mr. Macy's acting, and from a family with a member who has Cerebral Palsy, it was easy to see how well this film was done.

1806197,1,B00007CVWY,"I was debating whether to go one star or two star. When I moused over each star I learned that one star= ""I hate it"" and two stars = ""I don't like it"". I was thinking that ""hate"" was perhaps too strong a word but then remembered that, after watching the movie, I threw it in the trash instead of sending it to my brother as I had planned to. I think that encapsulates my opinion of this movie.
My involvement with the Bill Porter story began when I was visiting family in the Portland, Oregon area. There was a brief report on the news concerning the death of Bill Porter.  I had planned to send this movie to my brother to encourage him in his new sales related career.  After watching it however I was disgusted by several elements in the film. I would unhesitatingly give 5 stars to the real life of this hero, a role model for any person who needs to overcome a bad break, but unfortunately can not say the same about this depiction of his life.
William Macy, co-writer and star said in an interview: ""The breakthrough on how to tell the story came when we decided to fictionalize Bill's customers. Although Bill's life has had a lot of drama in it, it doesn't have a dramatic ""through-line."" ...So when we had the idea to write about how Bill affected people, it gave us a license to make up a lot of stuff.""
I don't think that Macy needed to make up anything to add drama to this real life story but it is more WHAT he made up that bugs me. He dishonored the life of this man by ""making up"" a peeping tom shower scene that never happened.  Next he hijacks Porter's life to serve as a scaffold for a gay marriage agenda, putting words in his mouth that he never said. Is it a mere accident that the only heterosexual relationship that is given a scene in the movie involves a man cheating on his wife? Oh, There is the Brady Family (apparently real name). Of course Shelly Brady is dumped on big time by the ""made up"" Porter when she shares her religious conviction that two guys having a sexual relationship is wrong. Hmmm... did I hear it correctly that one of the two gay guys had a female wife of convenience? The high likelihood of his giving the not yet historically identified but alluded to AIDS virus to her was just skipped over. Also not clear how, if the ""made up"" Porter knew of this marriage partner, he would still think it was just wonderful that the 2 guys stay together in a relationship that was not only perverse but also adulterous.  All of this flies in the face of Porter's deeply spiritual and morally uplifting life.
Macy claims to have a deep respect for this man but it is hard to perceive when he views Porter's life as a mere set piece on which to hang the diaphanous drapery of his own social agenda.",1392076800,8,2735,4.294573643410852
1806198,5,B00007CVWY,Written about the life of Bill Porter this will inspire you with the I can do attitude. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.,1391817600,,132,4.541666666666667
1806199,5,B00007CVWY,It is amazing how this man overcomes so many obstacles - and what is best is that it is a true story....  SO worth watching.,1391731200,,124,3.96
1806200,5,B00007CVWY,I do not write reviews except for those books or movies that can actually move me or stir my emotions. This was certainly one of those instances. This is a lump in the throat experience especially in one segment. Unforgettable view.,1390608000,,232,4.682926829268292

Macy (""Boogie Nights"", ""Cellular"") stars in ""Door to Door"", a non-fiction made-for-TV movie about a man with cerebral palsy who becomes one of the most successful salesman in door-to-door-salesman history.  The performances by Macy and Kyra Sedgewick are phenomenal!  I highly recommend it!",1384819200,,301,5.666666666666667
1806207,5,B00007CVWY,"""Patience.""  ""Persistence.""  We should ALL remember that good advice that Bill Porter's mother gave him often.  Bill's struggle was with Cerebral Palsy which made him ""walk like a drunken sailor"" (his words) and slurred his speech.  He wanted to be a salesman like his father, and against all odds, and with patience and persistence, he became one at Watkins.  This is a true story of a man who became interwoven into his customer's lives and hearts...and as soon as you watch this movie, he'll touch your heart as well.

Upon examining the inside of the case, where the DVD is held in place, I noticed that half of the little teeth were missing and, also, the DVD case doesn't snap to stay closed like other cases that I have just like this one.

1806267,5,B00007CVWY,"We are introduced to Bill Porter in 1955 who has cerebral palsy at the beginning of this story while talking with his mother about getting a job with a local company in Portland, OR as a salesman.  Despite his condition, his mother encourages him and advises ""patience and persistence.""  We are told that Porter's father was a successful salesman before his passing which is part of the back story. During the interview, the Sales Manager discourages Porter because of the physical demands of the job. Porter leaves the interview having been denied the job. But he turns around and asks for the worst territory with the advice that if he suceeds the Manger will be a hero, if he fails then nothing is lost.  With that Porter has done his first sales job.

We then see him going door to door the first time on his route and the reactions of prospects to this vocally and physically handicapped man.  At one home a young boy reacts in fright to Porter's appearance and manner of speech.  That results in a complaint to the Company.  The next scene has Porter using a hand puppet and humor the next time he calls on that house.  The child's fears are allayed and he gets an order from the boy's mother.  When Porter gets his first sale on his first day out, he celebrates by taking his mother out to dinner at a neighborhood diner.

This story follows Porter over a 50 year period.  He continues to work the same territory and we see how his relationships grow with the customers on his 7 mile route.  During this period, he faces challenges such as his mother becoming a victim of Alzheimers, his need to deliver purchases to his customers, his own accidental broken leg that puts him out of business for a time.  He solves each of these and pushes on.  One of the humorous scenes occurs while he is in traction with his leg in the hospital.  We see him pitching his product while in the hopsital bed, then the camera pans out and we see that the man in the next bed listening and responding to Porter's pitch is confined in worse shape than Bill.

This is a very humane presentation of an individual who refused to become bound by his limitation.  Porter is depicted as someone who is very goood in building relationships while following the dictum ""always be selling.""  The film is presented in chapters of about 7-8 year periods.  So we follow Porter during his entire career, including changes in the Watkins Company's method of sales.  We see how he adapts and goes on.

William Macy plays Porter and does a wonderfull acting job losing himself in the character.  I was convinced by Macy's acting.  See this film for the story and for the portrayal by a very versatile actor.",1322524800,,2678,4.533333333333333

1806282,4,B00007CVWY,"Most movies about sales people portray them in the cliched
""snake-oil peddler"" mode.  Because that's entertaining, hopefully.
Here's a fact-based story about a sales person who has great
challenges just living his life, much less pounding a demanding
sales route.  The scriptwriters, Macy and Schachter (of the old
St. Nicholas Theater Co. of Chicago), do not let the Bill Porter
character become a martyr in a maudlin homily.  He can be crabby,
and difficult to people who want to help him.  He has fierce pride,
but also common wisdom and humor.  He really likes people, and after
some hesitation, people really grow to like and value him, too.

  Kudos to Macy and Schachter for bringing this remarkable story to film.
Macy, whose idea this was, proves once again that he is a superb actor.
He is greatly helped by three of the best actresses working: Kyra Sedgwick,
Kathy Baker, and the glorious Helen Mirren as Bill's tough but loving mom.

The story is such a heart-warming look at a person who might have gone all through his life thinking that he would never accomplish anything worthwhile.  But he has an exceptional mother who never gave up on him, and who challenged him to be anything he wanted to be.  She even helped him!

I graduated Cum Laude (3.803) with my Bachelor's and am working with management at my employer to enlighten it that customers with disabilities make up the larges minority group, one anyone can join at any time through the lifespan. In 2009, only 50% of working age adults (18-65) with disabilities are working. Of those, 50% work a full-time job and still live below the poverty line. They are still denied equal access to community, education, employment - full citizenship, life without limits, because of preconceptions and prejudices.  I do not believe that Bill Porter is mentally slow.  He has a speech impediment. He has physical impairment. I do not believe he is mentally slow because he has a quick wit and fierce determination and is able to be an advocate for his mother when she was mistreated and to warmly relate to all his customers for years. He is now a motivational speaker and online sales consultant for Watkins.  William H. Macy's portrayal is amazing in its authenticity. The tone of this little movie is completely different from say, Forrest Gump; Bill Porter makes things happen for him, despite adversity.

William Macy, Helen Mirrin, Kyra Sedgwick, and the rest the cast are outstanding. This movie is not to sweet nor to depressing. The story based on Bill Porter is well handled. The directing is spot on and the camera work and sets take us to the past about fifty years and works back to the present. I loved how it showed his daily routine and those that helped him overcome the little bumps of not having the use of one hand and arm.

Well, I don't know if this really fits the chick flick mold, but it is a ""feel good"" movie that tells the story of a man who had to feel bad, at least in his physical body, all his life and yet was able to succeed through sheer determination.  It made me wonder about why so many able-bodied people can't seem to hold down a job.

One thing I really enjoyed that I don't see too many writing about is how each time period was faithfully represented through set decoration, costumes, cars on the street etc.  One thing I like to do with movies set in different time periods is look for anachronisms, things that don't belong there, and I didn't see any.  I really felt like I was moving forward in time, and I enjoyed all the cars (how many Hollywood car collections were involved in this movie?) and appliances, room decor, and popular music on the radios as we moved from 1955 to 1997.

It goes without saying that was made this movie work was the talented acting.  Not any group of people could have pulled this off.  My only question is why I had never heard of this movie before.",1191628800,,1193,4.318385650224215

After seeing it, you will not feel sorry for Bill Porter, instead we feel good, because he is a man that did accomplish something in life, living a life similar to many of us and still setting a standard of integrity and will.",1128902400,6,661,3.9328358208955225
1806318,5,B00007CVWY,William H Macy is truly brilliant in this film. Bill Porter is an inspiration to us all. A very enjoyable and heartwarming story with lots of tears of joy and sadness.,1123804800,,167,4.419354838709677
1806319,5,B00007CVWY,"Fantastic movie.  Made me laugh, made me cry.  Although probably classed as a ""chick flick"" my boyfriend also loved it. (Perhaps more for ""sensitive new age guys"")",1122940800,,163,5.0
1806320,5,B00007CVWY,"I had heard the story of Bill Porter before I knew his name.  I knew the work of William Macy, and that is what pushed me over the edge to view this movie version of the tale of Bill Porter's life from ""wanting to be a salesman"" to ""Salesman of the Year"" to ""Dinosaur"" and finally, full circle, to being an Invisible Thread who wove love into individuals, into a neighborhood and finally into the hearts of viewers like me.

William Macy's performance is excellent, I forgot he was William Macy about 15 minutes into the movie. Helen Mirren was remarkable as his mother - a big inspiration whose presence is felt even after her death both by Bill and by us each time we see him remember her (which is regularly.)

Kyra Sedgwick is luminous as Shelly - early in the movie her character is quite young and she pulls it off beautifully - and we watch her develop into ""just a job to keep me going through college"" to being much, much more as she matures into an adult side by side, heart to heart with Bill.

The syncronicities - again, woven by the thread of Bill, might have been seen as ""accidental"" - until we know the heart of the man.  Salespeople in all areas ought to watch this movie - it isn't about the products, its about honoring people and showing them how their lives can be impacted by those products.

Finally - this movie reminded me that Love will never go the way of the dinosaur.

Thank you - everyone involved in this film.",1102896000,53,1442,4.338289962825279

I would recommend this to anyone in an education setting or as an inspirational story about overcoming barriers and finding one's true meaning in life.",1101772800,9,451,4.625
1806340,5,B00007CVWY,"William Macy, like no other actor I think, can evoke such feelings of compassion. He is also plays a very likeable developmentally disabled person in this film. Bring a Kleenex box along when you view this movie.  As a parent of a severely disabled autistic boy, I felt for the character who was limited in his coping skills but who tried and tried and tried to make his life meaningful and to help others through his job as a traveling salesman. Detractors may say Macy over acts, but I think his character makes a sterling point, that people can overcome their severe disabilities with perseverance and the constancy that evolves from the honesty of the human heart.

1806344,5,B00007CVWY,"No doubt about it, Door to Door is the Outstanding Film Made for TV in the recently concluded Primetime Emmy Awards 2003. William Macy truly gave an astounding performance as Bill Porter, a salesman, but not your ordinary salesman. He can touch your life. Though suffering from Celebral Palsy but this does not gave him the reason to quit to be a salesman that de dreamed of to have. Truly, the triumph of human spirit was revealed in this film...overcoming whatever sickness, problems or prejudices that life can bring. Courage and conviction are elements that this film can show to us.
I commend Macy and his associates for a brilliant scripting. There's no dragging dialogue and well-chronicled. I recommend this to everyone. Excellent!",1070928000,,739,5.016260162601626

1806346,5,B00007CVWY,"My background includes both support for hiring the handicapped and personal selling.  So I sort of felt that I should watch this one. To my surprise it was very engaging. Sugar coated? Yes! But inspirational none the less. From a salesman's and the sales manager's point of view, however, it drives home the point that no matter who you are or what you are selling there is always an emotional component in selling. Sales people get off on tangents about technical things and price objections. Sales managers want a repeatable performance, like a Ben Hogan golf swing, but strictly as prescribed by the company. But through it all people like to buy from people they like.
The strong point about this story is that it is true. The movie makers may have sugar coated it but Bill Porter must have won friends, in spite of everything, in the toughest of the selling routines, or he could never had made it through 40 years. He could never have made it doing something with a faith that changed him from a dependent cripple to a self-supporting inspiration to others.
Everyone should see this film but especially sales people who should then buy a copy for your sales manager.",1064707200,3,1172,4.689320388349515
1806357,5,B00007CVWY,"This movie had a profound impact on me.  No one makes it through life without hardship.  But some face more of an uphill battle than most.  Bill Porter (played by Macy) was born with cerebral palsy, lost his father early in life, cared for his ailing mother and all the while resisted living off of social services and often refused even a helping hand.
This movie will make you feel guilty for ever being negative, feeling sorry for yourself, or stressing over little things which are never as important as they seem.  It will also remind you that physical disability is not a measure of a person's potential to lead a fulfilling life.  This is a story of a remarkable man and will leave you inspired!
The creators of this film could have taken the easy route and milked every sappy scene.  Focused on the difficulties faced, played on your emotions and slapped on a Hollywood ending, like everyone else.  Well, they didn't.  They don't allow you to feel sorry for Bill, because they potray him accurately and Bill would not have you feel sorry for him either.
However, the film doesn't patronize you by painting a rosy picture either.  Bill faces real difficulties in the physical demands of his job and the realization that he may not have the things (marriage, children) that many of us take for granted.
This movie makes you think, but allows you to draw your own thoughts.  It shows the good with the bad.  I loved it and it's not my normal genre.  Outstanding!!  As a side note:  Nothing short of a crime that Macy didn't receive more accolades for his performance.",1060473600,9,1572,4.607913669064748

1806359,4,B00007CVWY,"One doesn't see the classic DOOR TO DOOR salesman anymore. (The occasional youthful hawker of magazine subscriptions or Girl Scout cookies doesn't count.) But for more than 40 years beginning in 1955, Bill Porter walked the same sales route in Oregon for the (real-life) Watkins Company, which sold (and still sells) an esoteric mix of products from laundry soap to dog biscuits to condiments.
Porter was afflicted with cerebral palsy at birth. In this made-for-TV film, Porter (William Macy) explains its cause as the too assiduous application of forceps by the obstetrician who delivered him.  As the film opens, Bill is attempting, at age 21, to land his first job as a salesman, the profession of his deceased father. Porter is encouraged and supported by his mother (Helen Mirren), who writes the words ""patience"" and ""persistence"" with ketchup on the outside of her son's brown-bag sandwiches after Watkins reluctantly hires the young man. To prove that he can do the job despite his disability, Porter has challenged Watson by offering to take the toughest sales route that nobody else wants. Soon after, Bill's mother begins to suffer the mental impairment that eventually lands her in an assisted care facility. Bill is now on his solitary own.
If it wasn't for Macy's performance, DOOR TO DOOR would just be another of those warm and fuzzy human interest stories that otherwise makes my eyeballs roll for its political correctness. Macy, who's cast in the lead too infrequently, turns in his best performance since FOCUS (2001) - perhaps better. The actor's depiction of Porter's handicap is a pointed reminder of the difficulties to be surmounted by one so afflicted, even including painful isolation from normal, male-female sexual intimacy and romance.
At the end of the film's credits, the audience is made aware of the fact that the real-life Bill Porter has a website. Out of curiosity, I signed onto it and discovered that it's actually a link to Watson's on-line shopping catalog. It left me wondering if I hadn't just been manipulated into watching a lengthy Watson promo. It's that vague feeling of having been conned that causes me to award 4 stars instead of the five otherwise due Macy's brilliant work.",1045785600,16,2226,5.032520325203252

Kyra Sedgewick does an admirable job as Shelly, Porter's assistant and dear friend.  Kathy Baker's role as his best customer, Gladys, was also quite moving.  Helen Mirren plays Bill Porter's mother and deserves the highest praise for portraying a strong woman who gives never-ending encouragement to her son, proving that ""patience and persistence"" will overcome all things, including his cerebral palsey.

I'll begin by saying I don't know of any actor that could pulled off the role of Bill Porter other than William H. Macy. I was captivated, engrossed and touched through the entirety of this film. I'm sure for Mr. Macy playing this role was just a part of being an actor but he certainly has me convinced that he put every ounce and fiber of his soul into this role. I truly COMMEND him for his portrayal of Mr. Porter. The portrayal was done with a great deal of dignity and I'm sure the screenwriter had some to do with that as well. Almost all the performances in the film were Excellent including Co-Star Kyra Sedgwick's performance. However, this movie shines because of Willam Macy's acting. His performance alone is worthy of an Oscar. I never once thought he was acting, I  honestly believed he was Bill Porter a salesman with Cerebral Palsy. In the media of modern films, we are generally detached from the characters and sadly enough sometimes even the plot. But in this case I felt a connection with the characters and the storyline....specially that of Mr. Porter. I highly recommend this film, so rent it!
