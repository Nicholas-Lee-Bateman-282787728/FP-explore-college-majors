5118601,5,B0081OM6UY,"""Homeland"" is probably the best show on television right now. I was afraid that its second season couldn't possibly top the first, and it didn't....but it's still unbelievably fabulous. I don't want to give away all the gory details, but let's just say that as is always the case with this show, nothing went along as I expected it would, and the season finale was INSANE and leaves everything completely up in the air for Season 3.

I will gripe for a moment about my only (very, very small) gripes with this show. One, Jessica's character has become even more annoying, and while I sympathize with her plight, she does something with her kids in the next room that should earn her the title of Worst Mom of the Year. Seriously, what was up with that? Second, there is not and never has been any chemistry between Brody and Jessica at all. I guess you can easily explain that by saying that obviously there's no chemistry, because they both changed so much in the eight years that they were apart and have nothing in common anymore. Fine, I get that (though it would be interesting to incorporate some flashbacks of what they were like together before Brody went to war and was taken prisoner). My other gripe, though, is that there's no real chemistry between Brody and Carrie either. It just makes me wonder what their deal truly is as a couple. Are there really feelings there? It never seems like it to me. Or are they just two super messed up people taking comfort in the fact that they've found someone who is just as crazy as they are? I guess only time will tell.

Anyway, aside from my ranting...great show, great show, great show! Can't wait for Season 3.",1355702400,15,1666,4.53156146179402
5118602,5,B0081OM6UY,"The story is so full of suspense and fantastic characters... The twist and turns in the story are fantastic, and the relationship and chemistry between Carry & Brody is just electric... worth atching tima and time again...

I think is going to be a repeat of sweeping all the Emmys and any other respectable prize around...

I can not imagine what the writers are going to come up with next",1355184000,13,390,4.557142857142857
5118603,5,B0081OM6UY,"After watching through the whole first season of Homeland, when Nicholas Brody returns home as a decorated POW who survived 8 years of captivity, I had no idea how season 2 could top the event-filled first season, but as of episode 8 it doesn't disappoint, providing plenty of action and suspense.  Claire Danes and Damian Lewis are great choices for the roles of a Marine who is struggling with his allegiances and the CIA agent who happens to fall in love with her mark, and have magnetic chemistry together.

The first season included Brody's homecoming to his confused family and his involvement in a plot went wrong, as a result of which he questions his actions and must decide who to side with.  In this second season, Brody's obsession with Carrie (and vice versa) is coming into play as he tries to navigate his precarious position and try to keep his family safe while at the same time do ""the right thing.""",1354665600,88,917,4.648148148148148

5118703,5,B0081OM6UY,I was enthralled with Season 1 of Homeland. I binge watched the entire season in two nights begging for more. In season 2 the action and drama continues the second it starts till the second it ends. This is one of the best TV shows ever made. It has some of the best acting and storytelling ever. Claire Daines is an extraordinary actress who just gets better and better and deeper and deeper into this character. The chemistry between her and Damian Lewis is electrifying as he is equally as good an actor. The story is non-stop and exciting and you are rooting for both of them right up to the surprise season finale.,1445990400,,619,4.43859649122807

5118707,2,B0081OM6UY,"*********INCLUDES SPOILERS*********

Season 2 starts off very nicely with Carrie Mathison reluctantly pulled back into a critical CIA operation which can only be pulled off with her help (due to her relationship with a Syrian ""spy""). And help Carrie does, ultimately scoring a piece of intelligence that exposes Marine Sergeant-turned-U.S. Congressman Nicholas Brody for what he secretly really is--a traitor and a terrorist.

Unfortunately, it's all down hill from that early point on. Defying all logic, the CIA decides to turn Brody into a ""double-agent"" which leads to all sorts of nonsensical story lines, like the Arab terrorists totally relying on Brody to get the Vice-President to ""approve"" an Arab reporter's attendance at a military homecoming so they can set off a bomb. Pleaaasssseeee... when would the Vice President of the Unites State EVER be involved in approving what reporters attend what function!? It's so ludicrous it's literally insulting. Don't gotta be a brain surgeon to know the VP would NEVER be involved in such minor matters. Much the same is the terrorists' second ""plot"" to kill the Vice President by ridiculously ""hacking"" his pacemaker, which results in Brody actually KILLING the Vice-President by helping the Arab terrorists hack is pacemaker and then denying the VP medical aid while alone with him in an office.

YET, get this, kids, the CIA never blinks an eye or even suggests or even thinks it's suspicious that Brody, a KNOWN terrorist to them with a self-confessed video-taped personal confession stating that he wants to kill the VP, could have been involved in the VP's death? Again, this show is so ludicrous and insane it defines all logic. It's like... CIA: ""Oh, the VP died? Who was with him?  Brody?  Brody the turncoat terrorist who said on a video that he wanted to kill the VP?  Oh, not a problem. Nope, Brody couldn't've had anything to do with it.  Nah, never.""

And further dragging the show down is a time-killing subplot with Brody's dowdy, dreary, boring, monotone-voiced daughter who basically kills the show every second she's on it.

And then there's all the endless cheating--Brody cheating on his wife with Carrie, Brody's wife cheating on him with his best friend. Sickening really. I would have MAYBE believed the semi-attractive female Arab reporter seducing Brody to coerce him into staying involved with the terrorists' actions--that might have actually worked and actually been plot-relevant. But no, didn't get that.

Nope, we got more of the oh-so-great love affair (gag) between Carrie and Brody.  The ""love affair"" between Carrie and Brody, which was so forced, lame and utterly unbelievable in Season 1, sadly continues in Season 2.  Again, it's bad. I've never seen a ""love affair"" that was so forced and totally unrealistic. I don't buy for one second these two are ""in love.""

And to top things off, the world's most wanted Arab terrorist, Nazir, just randomly comes to the United States--the last place on Earth he would logically go--and basically runs around in a dirty old abandon factory ""masterminding"" inane and ridiculous Arab terrorist plots. Again, it defies all logic.

This show is basically a slap in the face to anyone with a brain.  Actual CIA people must watch this show and laugh at it. It must be like watching a ""Three Stooges"" cartoon to them.",1443657600,,3341,5.038112522686025

While Danes is not a pretty crier, she does a hell of a performance filled with emotion and nuances that makes her character very real and complex. there are many things I like about the show: Great story, great acting, believable suspense and I think overall all comes together well. There are plenty of details on the side that while not distract me from the story, they enhance my interest in the show. I don't give it a five because this is not quiet True Detective quality.
Flaws: There are scenes supposedly shot in DC but they are not.",1426464000,,567,4.461538461538462

5118783,5,B0081OM6UY,"As a former senior counterterrorism intelligence officer who has worked for and/or with all the national intelligence offices (DIA, CIA, NSA, DHS, etc.) at one time or another (and who has actually, as a side note, written a short non-fiction book on some of this subject matter), I can't recommend this series highly enough.

My friends often ask me, based on my experiences, how realistic this show is, amidst all the other ""spy"" shows available on cable. I can say, since Season 1, Homeland has been amazingly accurate in many ways, from intelligence collection methods to interagency cooperation (and, notably, the lack thereof, even after 9/11). This is the one show I can point to and say: ""this is actually how it's done!""

Now, of course, it's a Hollywood drama, and not a documentary, and all that entails. But, of all the shows that have attempted to pull this off, Homeland has easily proven to be the most accurate.

I also, just from a personal entertainment perspective, find Homeland to be a must-see cable series, alongside Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.",1422748800,,1073,4.884615384615385

5118850,3,B0081OM6UY,"This series is reasonably entertaining. The characters are generally interesting. At times though it is so incredibly unrealistic that it annoys me. Being able to text a message from a special ops room is not realistic. With the exception of perhaps the president, cell phones and similar devices are not permitted in classified environments. I also find Carrie's character to be quite weak in many ways. I would find this show more appealing if  her character was strengthened. In particular, I did not like the  season one plot line around her affair with Brody.",1411862400,2,564,4.98936170212766

5118897,5,B0081OM6UY,I chose Homeland on the recommendation of a radio reviewer with some scepticism but it proved to be every bit as good as the reviewer thought.

Watching Season 1 in reruns, we opted for the Season 2 DVD, which was exceptional.

Characters continued to engage, plot was layered, and acting superb.

Cliff hangers at the end of each episode made these viewers anticipate the next.  We did not do a marathon viewing as it was just part of experience to think about it, speculate and await...",1400112000,,444,4.582278481012659

5118907,3,B0081OM6UY,"This is a very well written show and I enjoyed the first part of the season. However, as the Brody- Carrie relationship bloomed, I came to dislike that aspect of the show. Carrie is a smart analyst, but shows tend to degrade strong women characters by making them give up all their principles for love. She comes off looking stupid and manipulated by a known terrorist and murderer, yet she doesn't seem to care. The dumbing down of her character ruins the show. She is kinda weird, but that plays to her character. Making her dumb does not.",1399161600,,541,4.530612244897959

5118911,3,B0081OM6UY,"I recently finished viewing seasons 1 &2 of Homeland. In general I would give it a high rating, but without giving away too much, some comments are in order. The premise is that two American marine comrades-in-arms are captured and held in captivity for  eight years by Muslim terrorists in the Middle East. The marines are turned against the U.S.,  become themselves terrorists in support of the Muslims, are freed and return to the U.S.  I find this premise hard to accept, but so be it.
The story-line proceeds from there and the race is on to discover them and prevent attacks on U.S. soil. There follows much suspense and some very good acting. Mandy  Patankin plays a high level CIA agent and he is excellent, totally believable. Claire Danes plays the central character, another CIA agent but with troubling psychological problems. It is a difficult complex role, but she does it justice. Damian Lewis plays the lead role as the turned marine. Some good and some OK.
There follows much inside U.S. government activity attempting to protect the U.S.  There is also considerable detail on the private lives of the key characters, in some caaes maybe too much. The suspense and surprises from episode to episode are quite good, sufficient to maintain  high viewer interest.  However the series is plagued throughout with excessive foul language. Almost every scene is f-this, f-that, and f--- the other thing. In fact in some scenes it seems like every few sentences. To my mind the use of the expletives is totally over the top and not believable.  If these chactacters were a street gang or maybe certain politicians then it might not be out of place, but from my  from my personal experience with these kinds of people, they don't talk like that . Oh and yes, the minor chactacters including the teenage daughter talk that way too. One has to reflect on why the writers and director feel that to be a successful show everyone must talk gutter talk. The series would benefit without this particular excess.
There were a few scenes  that pushed credibilty  but that's Hollywood. All in all an engaging series that shows the vulnerability of this country(and others) to international terrorism. It also shows that we have some dedicated people working to prevent it. Haven't yet seen any of season 3.",1397347200,,2304,4.837150127226463

I don't know how realistic any of it is but it was certainly entertaining.  I suspect our nations is much more ubiquitous and complicated than any of us know.  Good character development.  I loved that it tool so long to figure out if the protagonist was really a good guy or a bad guy.  Can't wait until the third season comes down in price.,1391385600,,519,4.34375

The writers, it seems, want to remind the audience that this is not broadcast TV, but ""special"" TV, T&A TV, and effing TV.. You see, when the character uses the eff word it ""indicates"" anger, frustration, fear--Eff! Efft up! Shut the eff up! ... etc, etc. Well, I was young once.

But this is BAD writing. It leaks. It effs up a great show. All the characters, almost, use the eff word tire-ingly. I say this not moralistically, but there seems to be an amazing deafness certain writers have to how poorly excess effs ""play"". But then ... the plot is so good, and Damian Lewis is so good that all that bullsh is redeemed. Claire is good too, was better last year, tho, Her lines also seem to want to remind the audience a bit too over-the-toply--""Don't forget, she's bi-polar!"" And, lest you forget, she turns up the dial on shrillness, grimacing, jumpiness, or just fretting in desperation. Making cartoon faces.

It got stuck on the piracy notice.  I asked for a replacement from Amazon, which was promptly replaced.  I got the replacement and had the exact same problem.  Disc 3 wouldn't play - stuck at the same spot.  Obviously it's a batch problem.  I downloaded the 3 episodes from iTunes and watched them on my iPad which cost me an additional $7.  The $7 wasn't a big deal but it was of course the principal.  I have no idea if its only the discs that Amazon has or if this  is a larger problem",1387411200,4,636,4.131147540983607

Second season, while still good, seemed disjointed and a little ""bi-polar"", to use a fitting term...the ending even seemed a little bit sophomoric.

Not sure if I'd spend the money for the third season.",1386288000,2,394,5.125

5119049,4,B0081OM6UY,it was very riveting and exceeded my expectations. i would very highly recommend this product to anyone who reads this.,1386115200,,119,5.0
5119050,3,B0081OM6UY,"As far as I am concerned, Homeland is one of the best shows out there right now. Superb writing, directing, acting, and above all, casting. The director has been able to capitalize on the idiosyncrasy and weirdness of Danes and Lewis characters to bring out an emotional weight and complexity that  carry the series forward and make it irresistible for COINTELPRO aficionados and dabblers in psychological warfare.

That's why I find the fundamental dishonesty and deceptiveness that epitomize the show  rather jarring.  The entire Series 2 is based on a terrorist pact between Al Qaeda and Hezbollah which plan and execute a large scale terrorist event in the US. That this does not make sense is obvious to anyone who reads the daily news - Hezbollah and Iran are waging a deadly war against Al Qaeda outfits in Syria, and Shias/Sunnis are vicious competitors in Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, Saudi and, of course, Lebanon (where the plot takes place in the first couple of installments). The show's obvious intent is to demonize Moslems across the board,Persians and Arabs alike. Christian Arabs are not above suspicion either - a terrorist tailor, Bassel, has a Maronite (i.e., Christian) name (Bassel/Basil). A CIA director (Saul Solomon) when asked how to look for suspects instructs: ""Look for the dark skinned ones!"".

It does not come as a surprise that the show is co-written & co-directed by an Israeli who takes advantage of political ignorance, opportunism and pro-Israel bias that permeates the network (Showtime). In a nutshell, the show also epitomizes Israel's relentless attempts to mold American understanding of the Middle East conflict through media agitprop and lobbying outfits such as AIPAC and WINEP by creating a  narrative where Persians and Arabs (US citizen or not) are to be distrusted as a matter of principle. Ever seen an Israeli bad guy on TV? How about Arabs?  The real life picture is more complicated. Israel has caused US much grief by pushing, through its neocon proxies, the country into the pointless Iraq war, by doing it's best to  scuttle each and every US-led peace initiative in the Middle East and by trying to force us into bombing/boycotting Iran. The most sophisticated spying network in the US is probably that of Mossad yet we hear not a peep about this outfit in the series; nor are there any references to the de facto ethnic cleansing in Israel which keeps fueling the conflict.

Despite excellent acting and directing, this show therefore works to undermine peace while serving as an enabler of those who are trying their best to destroy it. It is a simulacrum of the real world, a fantasy that gleefully  fans disinformation, anger and ignorance to benefit an agenda designed to undermine (to use Rush's term) the 'low information voter's' grip on reality. By providing us with good time it also disconnects us from the real world.",1385683200,2,2883,4.9875
5119051,1,B0081OM6UY,"I love this story line and when it works, it is great. However, I question where some of the videos from Amazon really come from. This particular set is terrible. Maybe I can get through parts of it clearly, and then it pixelates or just stops. I try moving through a section, but I have missed most of several episodes as it becomes unwatchable. I am returning this one, have ordered another one and will wait and see what happens. I wonder whether these are pirated copies - I can't understand why there would be so many problems otherwise.",1385683200,5,542,4.484848484848484
5119052,2,B0081OM6UY,"This show was over for me the moment when, at Season Two, CIA agent Quinn is shot and left for dead on the ground, blood coming out of his mouth. And then... surprise! The writers wrote one of the oldest scenes in the book: the guy simply discharges himself from hospital, at will. Yes, after being shot apparently on the belly. He just let loose the medical equipment, put his clothes and from then on deal with the shot wound with some painkiller pills. As new and fresh as he has ever been in his life...

This led the show into ""24"" territory.

Over for me.",1385596800,3,561,4.283018867924528

5119057,2,B0081OM6UY,"Totally vapid, sloppy, insipid plots and script writing. The Carrie Mathison character has absolutely no credibility, and Claire Danes' portrayal of this character borders on Hollywood camp. The first few episodes of Season 1 were fantastic, and I held on even after the story line turned improbable and nearly ridiculous. Season 2 begins weakly from a story perspective, and slides into farcical territory. ""Jumped the shark"" doesn't begin to characterize how bad this once promising series has become. It no longer warrants my money or time. I rate this purchase a ""2"" instead of a ""1"" because Mandy Patinkin's portrayal of Saul Berenson consistently is strong and dignified.",1385251200,3,677,5.277777777777778

5119063,5,B0081OM6UY,"This is Showtime at its finest.  This show is written sharper than a Tom Clancy novel with the same ""how did they know that?"" detail for facts, history, and locations.  Clarie Danes is just amazing in the role as Carrie, and you wonder if she is really a bipolar nut in real life because she is so accurate in her portrayal.  If you are in to intrigue on an international scale place in current events (attack on key US facilities) this will hook you.  Mandy Patinkin is very believable as a senior CIA department chief.  Damien Lewis plays a character as Markus Brody that evokes both sympathy for having been turned as a POW and hatred for his continued support of Abu Nazir.

Acting fits in well with the characters portrayed. In many movies/series the audience usually can think of actors that would be a better fit in portraying the character on screen.  In this series,I cannot think of any actors that would be better suited for the roles that are portrayed. Both the female leads show the emotions they are feeling in both facial expressions and body language. If the young lady playing the daughter continues to excel in the manner she is currently pursuing she will have an outstanding career.

I just finished the 2nd season of Homeland, and both seasons get 5 stars. I was afraid, especially since patriotism seems to sell so well, that this show would be trite and predictable. It was not. I never once groaned about predictable plot lines, cliches, ""been there, seen that"", etc.
Kudos to those who had the courage to tell a story that plays both sides against the middle, and to tell a love story without being sappy. And kudos especially to Claire Danes in the role of Carrie. Wow!",1382400000,3,652,4.396694214876033

In Claire Danes, the manic personality takes on an admirable quality as she strives to save the country but drives everyone around her totally nuts. (she must go back to real life totally exhausted). Damien Lewis is masterful in manipulating our feelings (and Claire's).Do we feel sorry for him or truly hate him? Do we understand his viewpoint or consider him the worst of traitors?
The supporting cast is excellent. We will be missing a few of the truly bad guys in government in Season 3.....I can't wait to see what happens.",1381708800,2,745,4.8203125

I couldn't figure out how season two was going to go since Carrie was pretty much out of commission.  They did a great job working all of that out and I enjoyed this season just as much as the first.  I really sucked in a breath a couple times while watching this.  The OMG moments were real breath takers. There are some real shocking moments in this season and I wasn't aware that not everyone would be moving on to season three.  I won't say more than that.  I know it's going to be a while before season three is out but you can be sure I'll order it ASAA.

5119215,5,B0081OM6UY,"The second season of ""Homeland"" introduced some unexpected twists and turns for the characters.

SPOILERS:

A number of months have passed. Brody has been elected a senator while Carrie has, after extensive electroshock therapy and medication to help with her bipolar condition, has turned to teaching. Carrie finds herself pulled into an agency op again when an ""asset"" she was working with approaches the CIA with information with the opportunity to take out Abu Nazir.

END OF SPOILERS:

The second season did something surprising (I can't give it away) by resolving one major plot point well before the conclusion of the second season a very daring move on the part of the writers/producers/directors/actors on the show that pays off with a surprising conclusion for season two as well.

For those that don't buy the love affair between Brody and Carrie, I buy it because they are both very damaged individuals who understand each other better than anyone else does them. Although they come from different sides, they share more in common due to their issues than anyone else on the show.

The transfer looks very nice--a sharp, rich looking transfer. Colors pop and detail is terrific throughout. This is a state-of-the-art transfer (I imagine the DVD looks quite good as well although I haven't seen it).

I have to give credit to Showtime for putting together a good(although not spectacular)package; unlike the Network's former poster boy for quality ""Dexter"", ""Homeland"" arrives with a number of good extras although, just like ""Dexter"", it lacks ANY commentary tracks. In this day and age, that just seems bizarre and cheap especially given the price for the package.

We get deleted scenes, a super 8 film diary by actor Damien Lewis, two featurettes and a VERY brief prologue to season three.

The conclusion for the second season signals a major shift in the storyline and characters which will, hopefully, continue to pay off with season three (there are indications that it will).",1380499200,2,1995,5.057926829268292

5119218,3,B0081OM6UY,"First season of Homeland.
No Spoilers.

Homeland is a good show. Not great, just good. Solid acting, dynamic editing, dramatic music; all make for pleasing television viewing. It's a little boring though.

While Homeland gets rave reviews from US audiences - not entirely uncalled for - I suspect they (most likely You, reading this) have not seen the original show, from which it is ported over. The average US viewer possibly doesn't even know Homeland is a re-make. That's why I said its only a good show.

The original is called ""Prisoners of War"" or ""Abductees"". It is an Israeli production.

Now, where I would give Homeland 3 stars, I would give Prisoners of War 5 stars. Why such a difference? Well, a point immediately deducted for the US needlessly re-making & dumbing-down yet another ""foreign"" production....

The other point is lost for general quality in comparison. Had Homeland been original, I would probably give it 4 stars. Because it's pretty good - it would be very good for the USA. But when I compare it to the Israeli original, it just doesn't cut the mustard.

The original has something that all production bosses (TV or movie) don't think Americans can understand or tolerate; subtlety. Apart from the top-notch - subtle yet intense - acting, the original has a slower & convoluted precision, a studied & intelligent approach to the material. It's also delicate in it's delivery.

What I'm trying to say is: See the original Prisoners of War. It's better.

Homeland is great for US audiences, which is all that matters really, as it's an American show. Like I said: solid acting, dynamic editing, dramatic music. It's got it all. The take on the material is good, the plot's fairly interesting, it's striving to be something above most insufferable US TV shows. So I can't really complain.

3 stars.",1380326400,2,1826,4.864516129032258
5119219,5,B0081OM6UY,"HOMELAND is an amazingly well-written show with a dream cast. All of the pieces fit together in keeping this political drama moving in surprising directions. The writers have kept the momentum in Season 2 as alliances and motives shift. The writing is crisp and fresh and stimulates the viewer with a story that delves deep into political, social and moral issues. Here is a show that excels in being well-written, absorbing and intriguing.

Season One left CIA agent Carrie Mathison's life shattered. There could have been no better choice to play Mathison than the lovely Clair Danes. Confident Mathison with a remarkable ""gut"" instinct fell into the depths of dispair in Season One.  Her career and confidence were gone.  This hotshot agent became a shell of her former self as she began to question the truth behind rescued hostage Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) and his ties to his former captor the terrorist Abu Nazir.

In Season 2, Brody is a congressman fast on his way to becoming a major force in politics. He becomes top choice as the Vice-Presidential candidate when the current VP runs for the Presidency. Brody seems to have it all as he tries to mend the rift with his wife and children. Mathison's life was destroyed in Season One when her theory that Brody had been ""turned"" by Abu-Nazir was ""proven"" wrong--though the viewer knew all along she was correct with her idea.
Season Two does not disappoint in its revelations that Mathison's instincts were not wrong. She is on the road to recovery and teaches English as a Second Language when the CIA comes calling.  Although it is not clear how she returns to the CIA, somehow she again becomes a major force in the agency. Let the intrigue continue.

HOMELAND keeps us wondering as characters, especially Brody, seem to change alliances and beliefs. How would someone return to their former life after years in captivity? How do ""good"" people become twisted with hate and revenge? There are some fascinated character studies here as new players are introduced this season. Zuleikha Robinson is outstanding as the Palestinian and British-educated journalist Roya Hammad. Hammad is beautiful and thoroughly wicked and devious with contacts in high levels of government. She becomes Brody's mysterious handler and connection to Abu Nazir. Hammad's sinister nature proves that evil can come in any form. Robinson brings depth and substance to the misguided Hammad.

Each episode only gets deeper and deeper into the minds of Brody and Mathison who re-ignite their volatile relationship as Brody's family life deteriorates beyond repair. There is a fascinating journey with a moral tinge. Who can be trusted and what is anyone's true intention? Even the ""good"" guys can be bad. Danes gives Carrie Mathison an edge that becomes more and more disturbed as she questions Brody's intentions. Her confused doe-eyed gaze that hovers between madness and sanity say more than any words could.

I'm hooked and can't wait for Season 3 on DVD. One disappointing note to mention are the bland and sparse ""extras"" that are included in this DVD set. Damien Lewis's Super 8 Movies-yes, he apparently still has an ancient Super 8 camera-does have some fun behind-the-scenes footage featuring cast and crew. Unfortunately, the extras are limited and give very little insight into the filming and visual effects and storyline.

HOMELAND is a fascinating exploration of life in the modern age of terrorism and political unrest. The writers are abreast of current events and the show has a force of reality that is rare on TV.",1380240000,5,3584,5.02020202020202

5119224,5,B0081OM6UY,"Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from season 1, and hints (but no major spoilers) from Season 2.  If you have not seen season 1 proceed at your own risk.

The fist season of Homeland was very original and told a very good story.  Brody, who had been a POW in Iraq was turned into a terrorist and a part of a plot to execute a terrorist attack in America, which he backed out of.  At the end of season 1 only the viewers knew the truth.  That changes very quickly in Season 2.  The tape he made confessing to the bombing he backed out of comes back to haunt him in multiple ways in the second season.

I cannot say too much without giving away a lot of what happens, but there is another terrorist plot in the second season that we don't know the full extent of until about 3/4 of the way through the season finale.  Many of the characters and relationships in the show change, and there are a couple very big twists.  The season ends with some things resolved and other questions left open.  It definitely leaves the show to go into a very interesting direction in the third season and will hopefully keep Brody's storyline from getting worn out.

The acting and writing of the show are both top notch again.  I do not think there was a downturn in either from season 1, even though there are some far fetched moments.  The A/V quality of the blu rays are very good, as you would expect.  There is not a ton of bonus material.  There is a very short prologue to the third season, a short film by Damien Lewis, a making of the second season feature and some deleted scenes.  There are also commentary tracks on selected episodes.  All in all, if you are a fan of the first season, you will most likely be a fan of the second.",1380153600,3,1732,4.247706422018348

This season just could not quite match the intensity of the first season.  The acting is still very good.  Claire Danes is once again outstanding as barely stable CIA operative Carrie Mathison.  The rest of the cast is still very good, especially Mandy Patinkin as Carrie's mentor at the CIA.

Spoiler Alert:

This season sees Brody (Damian Lewis) transformed into a CIA asset as Carrie and her CIA team turn him against his al-Qaeda captors.  There is a great deal of irony in this script and by the end of season 2 it seems that season 3 will find us completely reversed from the plot in season 1.  In season 1 Carrie was the only person in the USA who believed that Brody was working for al-Qaeda and was about to commit a terrorist attack.  In season 3 it appears that Carrie will be the only person who believes Brody is NOT a terrorist bomber.  Big time irony theme going there.

So, bottom line, I still recommend this series for those who don't mind a dark and adult themed show, but it has taken a step back in the intensity of the drama from the first season.  Perhaps they will get that back in season 3.",1379808000,,1273,4.324894514767933

5119243,5,B0081OM6UY,"A lot of people are complaining that season 2 falls short of season 1; that there is too much about the relationship between Brody and Carrie which gets in the way. I assert that season 1 lays the groundwork for how their relationship develops and becomes more complicated and troubled in season 2. Also, many aspects of the events that deal with the war on terrorism that are set forth in season 1 play out in season 2. The events of season 1 and 2 are intertwined and connected.

I am not going to offer any ""spoiler"" comments here but the events in both seasons, especially season 2, are becoming all too familiar these days. This show is, of course, fiction but in a way is not. The last episode called ""The Choice"" leads us to believe that there may be a happy ending with respect to the relationship between Carrie and Brody but the horrors of terrorism get in the way. The finale is a visceral, intense and disturbing experience.

But, with respect to the complaints about season 2, there may be a little too many ""mushy"" moments between the two protagonists. But, in an interview in the season 2 extras Danes says that these moments make the tone, at least for a while, be more ""human."" I get that. Both seasons run through at a almost fevered pitch, somewhat like many episodes of my other favorite, ""24."" But ""24"" also allowed Bauer to have some moments of his own, even though they were few.  They do not take away from the show but make the characters seem more real.

The writing as in season 1 is brilliant. I am especially moved by how Danes portrays bi-polar disease. She must have looked into the issue or been around people who know what it is like to be bi-polar; to have episodes that can be manic at one time and suddenly become depressive. As someone who has dealt with this problem it is wonderful and also a little scary to witness by Danes' astonishing acting how the disease can over, even consume, one's personality. Her bi-polar moments were almost like a mirror. Maybe not that extreme but a mirror nonetheless.

I have to add the the casting is brilliant. Having Mandy Patinkin as Saul who becomes Carrie's father-figure is wonderful. He is such a great actor and I am glad he took on this part. His somewhat world-weary tone is unmistakable. Also how he respects and is confused and frustrated by Carrie's behavior is  great.  Nobody else could have played Saul. Watch for his very moving prayer, in Jewish, at the end. You don't need to understand the words to realize what his prayer is about. Why he is praying becomes evident. I loved that brief moment in the finale.

One of the actor in the show that nobody talks about is Morgan Saylor who plays Brody's 16 year old daughter. I am always amazed how film and TV shows can find really great kid actors. Saylor is excellent. She acts like a typical teenager but her character also calls for depth and sensitivity and Saylor does quite well. Check out her reactions to her father's actions in the show's finale and you will see what I mean.

A TV critic for the New Yorker said that Homeland is the best show on TV. I could not agree more

5119249,5,B0081OM6UY,"As other reviewers have noticed, the plot for Homeland 2 is a pretty fat pill to swallow. Is life really like this? That is the question. But just suppose that a few years ago someone presented to you the plot for a movie in which the President of the United States encouraged Russia to confiscate chemical weapons from Syria in order to punish Syria for using chemical weapons on its own people. The plot of Homeland 2 is no more improbable than that, or than the other events we find in the news every day, and you may just find that once you get into it, you're hooked by superb acting, from everyone involved, and by very plausible characterizations. Danes, though not a classically beautiful woman, is hypnotically attractive. The camera loves the great range of her emotions and facial expressions through the hours and hours in which she occupies the screen.

This is not a great second year of any series, but it will do until another great one comes along. And most series these days really aren't all that good.",1379030400,2,1021,4.6098901098901095

One scene i remember is that Brody goes to a police station to report an accident, then the crazy woman didn't let him and he freaks out and almost blows his cover and everything.
I was like ""what the,,,""
A terrorist who almost blows the vice president into pieces completely freaks out just because he cannot report to the police and the daughter gets mad. Yeah right,,,
Also, Abu Nazir comes to the States and dies for nothing. If his death were the key, he could have just died in Iran or wherever. Why does he make such a hustle? It is simply stupid if you think about it.",1377216000,9,740,4.316546762589928

Now, the bad. It's not just that the plot got convoluted and unbelievable, but that the fundamental concept changed. I liked the show about an analyst fighting her mental chaos to be brilliant, and how office politics defeated it. Season 2 turned her into an irrational player in a sloppy love story that somehow supersedes the dedication to national security that defined her in S1. It wasn't just disappointing ; it felt like betrayal. There's no way I'll watch S3.

Some of the acting is hugely overrated. Everyone praises Lewis's accent, but the idea that a Southern, working class Marine would enunciate with such precision is ludicrous. He also gets cartoonish when intense emotions are required.

Watch S1 and stop, except for the single episode with Saul and Abraham's character talk. Ignore the rest.",1375401600,19,927,4.967741935483871

I stupidly purchased this DVD set from a site I found elsewhere online. I was drawn in by the facts that: 1) it was available NOW (already released), and 2) it was significantly cheaper. I got what I paid for, though. Upon arrival minutes ago I noticed that the package was from China, and upon opening it, I found that one of the corners of the box-set was smashed as if Dumbo himself had his way with it! Shame on me!! I regularly assert to others how fair and responsive Amazon is with any and all returns I've sent to them, but the ONE TIME I allowed myself to wander away from a vendor that has done nothing more than treat me like royalty, I get smacked with reality.

5119263,5,B0081OM6UY,"Well deserved awards... the 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, the 2011 and 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Drama, and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Damian Lewis and Claire Danes respectively.

This show is original at it's best.  24 is no way like this.  Claire Danes isn't Jack Baur.  But she plays a great spy suffering from manic depression.  Her character as Carrie Mathison is a CIA operative, unlike Baur's CTU agency.

It amazes me how the British actor Damien Lewis can portray the All-American Marine Veteran.  He amazed me in Band of Brothers.  And now Lewis has created this great character - Nicholas Brody.

Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson is a really good comeback for Mandy.  I liked him in Criminal Minds.  But he will always be remembered as Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride in 1987 (#Happy25thAnniversary to that movie #PrincessBride btw).

Now don't get me wrong here.  I liked the final half of 24's 8 seasons as well as the bits of the first seasons that I've seen.  So I think if 24 can survive 8 seasons, in my opinion, Homeland can too.  And like 24, Homeland is raking in it's due awards.

This show is superb and has brought Showtime in contention with HBO I think.  Season 1 was a great start.  And now season 2 has left us with cliffhanger questions - just as it should.

P.S.  Currently watching FX ""The Americans"" as we wait impatiently for season 3.  It's like Homeland but the main characters are KGB spy's living in America during 1980's.  I agree with Rolling Stone Magazine for saying that this show portrays the 80's quite well.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comint/dp/B00BMKVLGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comint</a>&nbsp;= The Americans.",1362787200,7,1845,5.059800664451827
5119264,5,B0081OM6UY,"The second season of the critically-acclaimed ""Homeland"" had a lot to live up to. The first season had a raw and frenetic intensity that was missing from television and delivered outstanding performances from it's lead cast. I know I, for one, was worried about what the second season would bring, simply because the first season was so good. I'm happy to report that my worries were unwarranted and so should anyone else's.

The thing I love about this show so much is that it keeps me guessing. Most shows on TV today follow a similar formula in which the audience can see what's going to happen long before it ever does. Any big reveals or surprises turn into moments that you wish had been presented earlier so the show could bring you something new. ""Homeland"" turns this idea upside down and throws it out the window. Like the season before it, this second season contains multiple big surprises and I mean QUICK. You won't have to wade through various episodes of filler for things to start happening; it starts out with a bang and doesn't let up.

Claire Danes and Damian Lewis are sensational in this show and are more than deserving of the recognition they've receives for their roles. Carrie, played by Danes, is slowly transitioning back into a life of normalcy when a familiar threat rears it's ugly head and drags her back into the world of terrorism and espionage. Brody, played flawlessly by Lewis, has a much larger role this season as he's forced to face the consequences of the decisions he's made since being rescued as a POW for eight years. Another high note from the season is Mandy Patinkin in his continued role as veteran CIA analyst Saul Berenson. I really felt like he deserved more screen time in the first season and was ecstatic that he get's just that here. Honestly the entire cast is great and it would take a much longer review to point out what I loved about each member of it. Suffice to say the characters, and the actors that play them, are as good as ever.

If you're like me and you have reservations about how this show can continue it's run as one of the finest on television, heed my words and trust me when I say that this season delivers. It may not be as great as it's predecessor, simply because the first season took everyone by surprise, but it comes pretty close.",1362528000,17,2314,4.5576923076923075

I found it extremely improbable that the female CIA agent had gotten through the CIA's background checks with her mental illness problem.  However, in season two, her fellow agents and superiors all know this and they act exactly as I would expect them to act having that knowledge.  They distrust her and don't want to use her.

Brody is now in Congress.  He is being groomed as a vice presidential candidate while the current VP would run for president.  His kids now go to the same school as the VP's and his daughter befriends the VP's son. His wife likes the escalation in their lifestyle but still does not like the Brody who returned from the war.  She would rather be with Tom but is trying to do her duty.

A new guy is introduced and he is a CIA agent who works with Carrie, Saul and eventually Brody. I thought he was a good new addition to the cast.

Our same male and female terrorists are back and they are still hatching plots, which the CIA must thwart. The water gets progressively murkier on whom Brody is working for and this heightens the suspense.  He gets in many tight situations.

I frankly don't understand why many viewers were disappointed with this season.  There were only a few avenues which they could use given that Carrie and Brody were both still alive and still our lead characters.  The creative people did a marvelous job on following that avenue.

I would give Season 1 of this show more stars since it was more plausible.  Both Seasons, however, had me twisting in angst - and I liked it.  I detest waiting for next week or next season.  But Season 1 of Homeland sucked me in.  Only the audience and CIA agent Carrie Matheson (Claire Danes) know that returned POW Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) is a closet terrorist.  He shot and killed his friend without batting an eyelash, wore a C4 vest to kill the vice president of the U.S. (only to back out) and began an affair with Carrie.  The audience does not know if Carrie is really in love with Brody or just trying to gather more information.  As Carrie frantically attempts to derail Brody's terrorist quest, Brody takes out a restraining order on her and warns her to leave him alone.  She cannot and appeals to Brody's daughter to call her father on his cell phone just as he is trying to get the C4 vest to work in an underground bunker.  For her efforts, poor Carrie is arrested and hospitalized.  Defeated and with nobody believing her, Carrie is booted out of the CIA and checks herself in as a patient for her bipolar disorder where she undergoes shock therapy and loses some of her memory including the name of terrorist Abu Nasir's (Navid Negahban) son that Brody had shouted out one night in his sleep.

In Season 2, Brody is now a Senator and is planning to run for Vice President.  Carrie is teaching English classes and living with her stable but bipolar father.  The CIA needs her expertise to try to turn a former female contact overseas to capture terrorist Abu Nasir.  Just at the last second Nasir receives a text message warning him of the trap.  Carrie returns to the U.S. and continues to work on the Nasir case (unofficially) and an older recording of Brody explaining his bomb vest attack on the Vice President is discovered in some items that Carrie steals from a contact of Nasir.  Carrie's mentor, Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), lets her know what was found and a new CIA agent Quinn (Rupert Friend) works with her in a surveillance sting on Brody.  Finally, Carrie is vindicated but not reinstated to her former job due to her bipolar disorder.  She confronts Brody, he is tortured and agrees to help the CIA.  For some unknown reason, Carrie resumes the affair with Brody.  The season ends with a bang with Carrie wondering if Brody was just manipulating her the entire time.

There are many more plot twists, characters, and nefarious deeds than I have mentioned, and although the premise is not as plausible as some other shows of this genre, it is, after all, entertainment that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Recommend!",1358121600,29,2687,4.610526315789474

Season Two is just terrible. WTF happened to the writing on this series? It turned into a bad network television series right out of the 80's. Bad acting, stupid story lines and an implausible love story that hijacked the most intelligent, realistic drama series of 2011. If you liked Angie Dickenson in the 1970's series Policewoman, you'll like Season Two. This was a major, major disappointment.",1357948800,37,570,4.876288659793815

The series of ""Homeland"", ""Person of Interest"" and ""24"" are addicting!  Each of these series is action-packed, with surprises in each episode, great acting and directing and contains enough true events to make you paranoid about who the good guys and who are the bad guys in today's real world--quality productions that will keep you glued to the television screen wanting to know what will happen next.  Claire Danes played in the hit fantasy movie ""Stardust"" and it was the first time I had seen her--she is very believable in the parts she plays.

5119288,5,B0081OM6UY,"SPOILER-FREE

I was worried about season 2 of Homeland; worried that they would not be able to re-capture the atmosphere and intensity of the first.  In a way, I was a little right.  I personally think the first season is quite a bit better, but being in one of the top 5 television dramas currently on television, it's easily a 5/5 stars still.

It's really hard to say too much without giving away spoilers.  The best way to put it - things change...and they change A LOT.  The whole dynamics of the show are different this season.  A startling revelation is discovered early on and turns the show completely on its head.  The formula is different, but for the most part, the outcomes are the same.  It is still one of the shows best at creating tension and suspense and is a true CIA thriller.

CAST - the actors are superbly cast.  Mandy Patinkin as Saul is incredible as ever this season, and even gets almost a whole episode dedicated to his acting talents.  Claire Danes is perfect as the emotionally unstable, yet brilliant Carrie.  Damian Lewis as Nicholas Brody has a lot of emotions to balance, obviously, and does it well.  The supporting cast is also pretty talented.  Homeland also garnered a lot of attention when they practically stole the Emmys with Best Drama, Best Actor in a Drama (Lewis) and Best Actress in a Drama (Claire Danes).

STORYLINE - things are definitely different this season.  Does Carrie get her vengeance for what Brody did to her at the end of last season by telling Estes?  Do her and Brody get romantic again?  You'll just have to see, but things are shaken up and are very different from last season.  And they happen quickly.  It's incredibly difficult to give away much without spoiling, but there's always a black cloud over everything, and you never know what will happen next.  Sometimes it's surprisingly predictable, and other times it's really out of nowhere.

BELIEVABILITY - okay, things get a little murky here.  On one hand, this *is* entertainment, not a documentary.  On the other hand, viewers and critics tend to value at least some semblance of realism in their dramas these days, especially on premium cable channels.  There was one episode in particular this season ('Broken Hearts') that really upset a lot of critics and many viewers due to how far they stretched the realm of the possibility.  Forgivable?  Definitely, for a show like this.  But they *were* somewhat resorting to cheap plot tricks to make stuff happen like a B terrorist movie instead of clever writing, so hopefully it was a fluke.

FUN FACTOR - lots of fun!  It's a high quality action/thriller/terrorist show, so you can expect plenty of drama, chases, near-deaths, plotting, deception, character moral ambiguity....there's definitely so many fun aspects to it that make it worth watching.

If you want to be in the loop of the best shows on television, you should definitely be watching Homeland!",1356048000,167,2930,4.798

5119290,5,B0081OM6UY,"After Episode 1 of the second season of HOMELAND was aired a it appeared that this would be an intensely interesting, psychological thriller. All of the ingredients seem to be present - fine writing (Alex Gansa, Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff), fast paced direction by Michael Cuesta, and a very strong cast including Claire Danes in one of her most challenging roles, Damian Lewis and Mandy Patinkin.

The concept is very much in the public eye at this point - a study of how terrorists are followed and found and how the US Intelligence Service functions. The first episode introduced all of the main characters and fleshed out in a single episode the clues for all of the complicated substories and subplots that the series promises. After eight years absence Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) was thought MIA but is discovered in a filthy cell in Iraq ad brought back to the US in a Marine Victory parade. Brody had been captured with another Marine who was beaten to death and the reasons why Brody survived and his fellow Marine didn't makes CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) suspicious - could Brody have sold out to Iraqi bad guy Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) and that is how he survived torture and captivity? Mathison is driven to see if her concept is correct, gains the backing of her boss Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin, and successfully fills Brody's house with surveillance equipment so his every move can be observed. The sidebars include the fact that in Brody's absence his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin) has fallen in love with Brody's best friend Mike (Diego Klattenhoff), and in the intense questioning and shock of being back home Brody begins to remember events of his capture and imprisonment including the fact that he was the one who beat his fellow Marine to death at the behest of Abu Nasir. Brody's physical condition and body language also give signs that perhaps Mathison's concepts that Brody sold out to Abu Nazir and is plotting an attack on America are viable. The stinger is that Carrie is discovered as being on antipsychotic medication since a young girl - making her contributions to intelligence under suspicion. She undergoes therapy including electroshock therapy, lives with her compassionate sister, and since she had stange and seemingly dangerous behaviors she has been let go from her work as an agent. Now with the second season we find a recuperated Carrie, a more convincing Brody who becomes a candidate for Vice President and is now open with his wife and daughter Dana (Morgan Saylor)  about his conversion to Islam, and once again the numbers of events that occur in rapid fire sequence keep us glued to the story. A few new characters - the enigmatic Quinn (Rupert Friend, absolutely brilliant), the suspicious Roya (Zuleikha Robinson), Estes (David Harewood), and even the brief appearance of a character whose significance remains a mystery in  F. Murray Abraham as Dar Adal. The final episode brings Brody back into suspicion at the memorial service of the Vice President Walden (Jamey Sheridan) when a bomb in Brody's car parked outside the CIA building explodes.

There is a tense chase and capture of Nazir, and changes which make the relationship between Carrie and Brody bounce up and down. The real test of whether a series will continue is the degree of unanswered questions left to be resolved in the final episode, and this case there are so many unknowns that it makes the anticipation of next session very high. A very successful Second Season.  Grady Harp, December 12",1355788800,36,3541,4.904841402337229
5119291,1,B0081OM6UY,"In some ways this show does represent the current climate in the United States: Its equal combinations improbable, irrational, paranoid and crazy while depending on the shock value of the unpredictable to entertain. Preposterous is a good word to describe the show and its writing.

In its second season, the show moves away from its initial mental illness theme (all fixed up by shock treatments) and turns into a rather preposterous love story. To make it work, they have to clear the decks of the entire extended plot of the previous season, characters and all. So goodbye Evil Vice President. Goodbye Abu Abu....I sure wish I knew what your master plan actually was. Goodbye little Vice President too.

When the writers reach the plot's figurative ""corner"", the literally blow it up to allow them to start anew. Now the guity are innocent and we are sort-of replaying the fugitive while we track down the new terrorist hiding in the shadows who is 1000 times worst than good old Abu Abu.

I think this thing has finally run its course. Running on shock value always ends with the plot running out of fuel. Thats where this is now.",1355788800,30,1134,4.746192893401015
