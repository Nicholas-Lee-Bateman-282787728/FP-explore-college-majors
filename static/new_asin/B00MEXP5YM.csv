6575760,2,B00MEXP5YM,"Uncle Grandpa is indeed very interesting from a visual standpoint, but as far as actual content goes it leaves alot to be desired.  Once you get over the general random wackyness of the show there really isn't much meat left on the bones.  Not a horrible program, but not quite on the same level as the rest of CN's current origional series.",1474934400,,341,4.483870967741935

6575764,5,B00MEXP5YM,"This DVD contains 12 episodes of the cartoon ""Uncle Grandpa"". Uncle Grandpa is a cartoon about, well, I don't really know. It's basically a man who's everyone in the world's Uncle and Grandpa...somehow, and his friends, his talking sidekick Belly Bag, the self-proclaimed ""cool"" Pizza Steve, the normal Mr. Gus, and his Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, who go around helping kids or doing other insane stuff. After each episode there's a 1-minute random short related that has nothing to do with the episode. The show is pretty hilarious and great, so I recommend it.

Here's my thoughts about the cartoons:
Belly Brothers (Uncle Grandpa helps teach a kid why big bellies are cool): This episode is pretty funny. I liked the fight in Night Wolf Land. Pretty good one. A
Tiger Trails (Giant Realistic Flying Tiger goes missing): Great episode. I liked the joke with the kid who is stuck fighting a wizard for the entire episode, good belly laugh. The episode really picks up when the gang accidentally release a zombie army of dead pets and only GRFT can save them. Another great one. A
Funny Face (Uncle Grandpa makes a face so funny, it comes to life and attacks the gang!): Quite possibly the weirdest episode on the disc, this one is kinda off. I didn't really laugh like I did with the others. And that funny face was an actual face and I didn't really like to look at it. Nothing really happens as the episode goes on, so I have to give this one a C.
Space Emperor (Uncle Grandpa must bring a kid back from another dimension): This one is really entertaining and has a good story, but not that funny. It keeps me hooked, but more laughs, please. B+
Afraid of the Dark (Uncle Grandpa helps a little girl overcome her fear of the dark): One of the best episodes on the disc. Uncle Grandpa and the girl go on a quest across the room which is giant and full of scary monsters, and it's one of the best moments of the disc. Very good episode. A+
Driver's Test (Uncle Grandpa will do anything to help get a teenage girl her license): Another great episode, with a wild goose chase with a crazy baby in the clouds. It just gets crazier and crazier as it goes on. Good one. A
Uncle Grandpa for a Day (When Uncle Grandpa gets his head stuck in a jar of peanut butter, Mr. Gus and Pizza Steve take his place): Mr. His and Pizza Steve attempting to be Uncle Grandpa is just too much. I laughed a lot. Also the whole trash can bike thing is also very funny. A+
Uncle Grandpa Sitter (Uncle Grandpa babysits himself, but gets into chaos when he steals a giant robot's chilidog): Wow. This episode is so insane and crazy, yet very funny. I enjoyed the robot fight scene. Great episode, but feels kinda overly insane at some parts. A-
Treasure Map (Uncle Grandpa, Pizza Steve, and Mr. Gus follow a child's placemat activity to get buried treasure): This episode is one of my favorites. It's ridiculous what the actual situations are, like the Laser Light Show being a bank security system. And the ending is ridiculous. A+
Charlie Burgers (The gang help a dog retrieve his lost ball): My favorite episode. It's insane as they mess with gravity to get the ball, making for insane belly laughs and tons of fun here. A+
Perfect Kid (Uncle Grandpa turns a kid into a robot who tries to kill him. Can Shaquille O'Neal save him?): A weird one, but a good one. Shaq's appearance here is great. The rest of the episode is good. Best part is when the kid says ""Uh, Uncle Grandpa, why are you staring over there?"" and we see him looking at teleprompters and a camera crew recording the episode. Great Fourth Wall break. A
Future Pizza (Pizza Steve goes back in time to stop himself from dissapointing Uncle Grandpa): This episode was pretty boring and mostly just Pizza Steve worrying about the future. The short at the end though, completely makes it up, though. Uncle Grandpa and friends play a board game where whatever they land on, actually comes true. Like Mr. Gus lands on ""Go To Jail"" and actually goes to jail. I liked this better than the entire episode, and laughed more than the entire episode. The episode itself would be a C but with the short it's a B.

Overall, quite a good first set of episodes and lots of fun here. Can't wait until they release the full first season. I'd buy it.",1445126400,,4275,4.486521181001284

If you're a parent looking for entertainment for your child, then you've found your crock of gold. Watched Uncle Grandpa with my elder son in HK on Cartoon Network and we were both laughing our way across the harbour on the ferry to Kowloon. Hilarious and very silly humour - the very same sort of stuff that you will either love or loathe. But your kids will love it for sure.",1437004800,,484,4.449438202247191

6575772,4,B00MEXP5YM,"Meet your Uncle Grandpa.  You might think you don't have one, but you actually do.  To me, he's more of a mysterious man with a mission which is to visit all the kids in the world and solve all their problems and have a fun time, too.  Along with Uncle G, are his friends Pizza Steve, Mr. Gus, his Belly Bag, and the Giant Realistic Flying Tiger riding along in Uncle G's magical RV.

This first volume of the new series has 12 enigmatic episodes such as:

""Belly Brothers"" - In Uncle Grandpa's first gut-busting adventure, he tries to help a fat boy learn to accept for who he is.
""Tiger Trails"" - Uh-oh, Giant Realistic Flying Tiger is missing !  Luckily, the others attempt to find her by following the rainbow trails she leaves behind.
""Funny Face"" - Uncle Grandpa unleashes a face so funny it cannot be stopped !  The only one who can probably stop it is the dour Mr. Gus.
""Driver's Test"" - Uncle G helps a teen girl try to get her driver's license in any and every way possible.
""Uncle Grandpa for a Day"" - When Uncle G gets his head stuck in a jar, Mr. Gus and Pizza Steve step in as his replacement.
""Treasure Map"" - When the gang can't pay the bill for their dinner, they attempt to find buried treasure using a kids' placemat activity.
""Charlie Burgers"" - A talking dog needs Uncle G's help for retrieving his lost ball.
""Future Pizza"" - Pizza Steve attempts to travel back in time to stop himself from disappointing Uncle Grandpa whatever that is.

Along with these episodes are other short bits that have Uncle G and the gang as well as other characters that are a bit irrelevant to the series.  So make every morning a ""Good Morning"" when you pay a visit to your Uncle Grandpa on DVD here and in new episodes every Thursday on Cartoon Network !",1428105600,,1757,4.3323170731707314
