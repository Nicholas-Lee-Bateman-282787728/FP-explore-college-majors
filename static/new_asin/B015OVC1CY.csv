7445447,5,B015OVC1CY,I find it strange people reviewing a film that isn't actually released.  I loved the first one and I am excited to see the second.  these are very complex films and deserve multiple viewings.  I have seen the trailer and it looks worthwhile,1447286400,2,240,4.534883720930233
7445448,1,B015OVC1CY,Looks like a grade school play project. Freaking Awful.,1513382400,,55,5.222222222222222
7445449,4,B015OVC1CY,good movie,1512604800,,10,4.5
7445450,3,B015OVC1CY,"Well. There are alot of negative reviews and I have to first complain about Amazons rating system. I only gave this movie a 3 because 2 says "" I don't Like it"" And that is not entirely true. I watched the entire movie and was confused almost completely as far as the plot goes. I would say it has the best special effects in a low budget movie that I have seen, That really is its only redeeming quality. Acting is bad but I am thinking with a few rewrites and better direction it might have been better. I guess I am saying I don't necessarily think it was the actors fault. I did stay interested because I did like the story-line as some thought was put into it. Over all the problem with this movie is extremely poor editing as scenes seemed to end too soon and others went too long. There was very little character development and when some of the characters died I didn't really care. Essentially the movie sucked but it didn't have to. There was enough there that it could have been a nice little B movie. With a larger budget it may have even been a real movie. So watch if you really like scifi and you have the time. DO NOT pay any money for it.",1511222400,5,1154,4.179372197309417
7445451,1,B015OVC1CY,"Wow, this was terrible.  Kept waiting for it to turn into a porn flick.  Bad costumes, terrible acting, and poor CG produce a movie that requires a lot of alcohol to enjoy.

Pretty good if it's a University Senior Project!",1510963200,2,222,4.5
7445452,2,B015OVC1CY,Decent Scifi concept. Almost incoherent in execution.  Only real scifi die-hards will be able to watch it to the end.,1510704000,,117,4.85

7445454,1,B015OVC1CY,"Danger, Will Robinson!  This ""movie"" shows how to do _everything_ wrong.  Entire production was hideous, from script to acting to filming and effects.  Really I can't think of 1 redeeming or slightly mitigating feature, including (lack of) budget.  I'd make an imdb list of the actors and director, so as never to watch anything they're involved with again, but since they'll never appear elsewhere, there's really no point.  Starship Troopers, another piece of junk, looks like art in comparison to this, as do the spacecraft drawings on my fridge.",1509580800,,549,5.123595505617978

7445458,4,B015OVC1CY,"It wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't a bad movie either.  The writing could have been a lot 'crisper', and the story line was fragmented in spots.  For a 'B' movie though, it wasn't all that bad.",1508889600,,197,4.157894736842105
7445459,1,B015OVC1CY,"Oh god, this was bad. I couldn't get past the first 10 min!
The worst writing, acting, set design and everything I've seen in a LONG time outside of comedies and spoofs.
 Who gave these people money???",1508716800,,201,4.4324324324324325
7445460,1,B015OVC1CY,"BAAAAAAAD AAAAAAAACTINNGGGG....Don't watch it if you cannot stand cheesiest acting. I couldn't stand 5 minutes of this piece of garbage. Normally, I would ignore bad graphics because story is what matters. Ship crew look like cranky adults with bad overblown makeup - seriously? Whoever wrote the dialogues needs to be fired...",1508544000,,327,5.431372549019608
7445461,3,B015OVC1CY,"Films are shot out of sequence, and it's up to the editor (with directorial input) to put those sequences in order so that the final product becomes a cohesive whole that makes sense to the audience.

This film doesn't do that at all. It is the most disjointed story I have ever experienced on screen, with a storyline that can best be described as confusing if you are a rational person.

It will make you wonder just how much money was lost on this film when it came out.  More amazing still: this was the SEQUEL starring these characters - the first film was called Starship: Rising and some of that backstory is referenced in the muddled opening for this film. Since the cast was largely intact from the first film to the sequel, I suspect that they were shot at the same time and split in two, since both were released in the same year. As of 2017, they have heroically spared us a third installment.",1508371200,,905,4.407185628742515

7445463,2,B015OVC1CY,"I once tried my hand at writing a sci-fi script when I was in fourth grade. I stopped about 3 pages in because I realized how bad it was. This movie reminds me of that, except that this writer kept going even to the point of producing a feature out of it.",1508025600,,255,3.923076923076923
7445464,3,B015OVC1CY,"This was classic Sci-Fi of the cheesiest kind.  The plot has some very interesting turns which would have been great, but the story was so disjointed it was hard to follow.  For a low budget sci-fi film, it did have some cool effects and some scenes.  If they would have just connected the plot together it would have been better than a ""B Movie.""  The acting was not bad -- but no great performances.  A few very good scenes that were pretty well acted.  If they had spent just a little more time on continuity, this could have been a decent small budget film.  Still, it was fun if you watched it for free with Prime like I did.  The ""Space Carrier"" had a landing strip on top.",1508025600,2,679,4.25
7445465,4,B015OVC1CY,"Had to chip in my two cents.  Yes some of the effects are really rough, but I thought it was a pretty good story and some decent acting.  It's a 3 star movie that I gave 4 because of all the 1s.  I mean it's not so bad it should be getting 1 stars.  Hope the director gets a real budget to see what he could do.",1507852800,2,311,3.5970149253731343
7445466,4,B015OVC1CY,"A decent B movie, with a decent storyline. It's really a 3 and a half star movie. The costumes are your typical hockey shoulder pads, electrical conduit flex tubing, CO2 cartridges and dryer vent tubing. Sound effects are a combo of Cylon ""by your command"" and star war phasers. Its worth a watch if you like sci-fi and have a spare hour and a half.",1507852800,,349,4.384615384615385
7445467,1,B015OVC1CY,"10 minutes in I thought to myself, ""Wow.  This could be really good if it wasn't for the bad acting, the enormous plot holes already, the confusing dialog, the bad graphics (aka never could have been good at any point since I drew stick figures graphics) and the obligatory ""hot sci-fi girl"" that really isn't hot but some geek thought that a hot chick in a bad sci-fi film would like this-type.  And now that my writing skills have devolved to 2nd or 3rd grade levels, it equals the quality of this movie.",1507766400,2,506,4.43010752688172

7445473,5,B015OVC1CY,"For what they had to work with this is a great movie.
The story is good, although it definitely refers to things from an earlier movie. (I haven't watched the first one, was unaware of its existence, but this one is good enough I will find and watch Starship Rising.)
The graphics aren't as good as a mega million dollar epic, but they are better than most B movies, so sufficient.
The acting has rough spots, and the main actor is wooden, but mixed with the rest, forgivable.
I would like to see a followup movie with the robots in charge and humanity beating them back, but we will see if that happens.",1507075200,,604,4.353982300884955
7445474,1,B015OVC1CY,"A waist of and space.  The graphics where better on the original Star Trek and they did not have computers.  I did better graphics with a Dubner 30 years ago for news cast.  The acting is not even up to par and the dialog is Juvenal.  The action shots are poorly executed as if they had no director.  The only thing else I can say is if you have nothing else to watch you are still better of not watching this movie,",1506902400,,416,4.024390243902439

7445487,4,B015OVC1CY,"Starship Apocalypse is the sequel to Starship Rising. You do need to watch the earlier film to understand the enormous story that Neil Johnson is telling. But if you don't want to watch Starship Rising first you will receive a small introduction at the beginning of Starship Apocalypse which provides some of the basics about the previous story and where the characters were left, but you do yourself an injustice. This is an epic story which has been made on a miniscule budget. I would love to see what Neil Johnson could do if provided with the funds he needs to make a blockbuster. However, these films are what they are and in truth much of the production is rather ordinary simply due to budgetary constraints. Some of the acting is ordinary (I'm being kind) and the sets are very basic. The production is loaded with special effects - some of which are quite good, although the space craft do seem to behave strangely, changing directions far too quickly and awkwardly. But the story in Starship Apocalypse is much better paced than the earlier film, and it is far easier to follow the plot. There is also more explanation of the relationship between the Federation and Terra Nostra - something that was lacking in the first film. And by the end most of the plot threads were brought together leaving a satisfying end to the saga. This film benefited from a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (the previous film had a stereo track only) and this worked quite well with a nice balance between the music and speaking voices. If you like science fiction in space and are prepared to forgive the limitations forced by a small budget, you might enjoy Starship Rising and Starship Apocalypse.",1454716800,6,1687,4.722033898305085
8734184,1,B015OVC1CY,"From the very beginning of this movie I couldn't tell who was who.  Couldn't understand what the conflicts were or what side (if any) each character was on.  No character development at all.  Just jumps into new scenes with new characters like we should know everyone already.

The narrator mumbles so bad  that I couldn't understand 50% of what he said.  Same problem with the deformed overseer.  Couldn't understand anything he or his computer voice system said.

The actors also acted like English was not their first language.  I was waiting for subtitle translations to scroll by as their dialog was so bad.  It was like they were doing rehearsals not the actual scene.

The writing was awful.  No plot at all that I could discern.  Just a bunch of unknowns all fighting with one another and plotting each other's downfall.  Several times they would show a character doing something and then another character would say they are dead.  So a federation is collapsing?  Are they part of the good guys or bad guys?  Who is the federation and what do they stand for.  Is there a reason to care?

Then the 1970s quality special effects were just awful.  Weapons in space that made the gadoooo sound as they fired were actually comical.  Then the two characters that did nothing but do bathroom and bad fart jokes. Who were they?  Again how about some character info? They certainly didn't put much of their budget towards that.  Also special effects that I could do better on a personal computer myself today.

I bailed on this movie half way through.  Couldn't tolerate it any more.  Don't waste your time with this one.  This is the kind of footage that ends up being cut from most movies.  It's dull, boring, incomprehensible space SciFi.",1536105600,,1741,4.713333333333333
