4371007,3,B004FUKLDC,Series continuously getting weaker.,1413158400,,35,8.0
4371008,5,B004FUKLDC,It has to be the spectacular scenery.  Susan Hampshire of Palliser fame sparkles.  The rest of the cast is okay with the exception of Golly the Gilly brilliant quiet moody Scot who dances the saner dance.  If you followed the series you saw an almost painful slow start that built the characters haphazardly. Series three builds just endearing and predictable they can be.,1395446400,,372,4.873015873015873
4371009,4,B004FUKLDC,I liked all three series.  The photography of Scotland is stunning and the story line held up.  Perhaps not as good as Series 1 and 2.,1393632000,,134,4.115384615384615
4371010,5,B004FUKLDC,"What's not to love about fascinating characters in a breath-taking setting playing out their
interesting life stories.  The Scottish accent of a few characters is challenging to understand,
but it would not deter me from the series.",1390521600,,232,5.27027027027027
4371011,4,B004FUKLDC,"I found this series by chance and fell in love very quickly with the whole show---the wonderful locale and the great characters.  Each one was funny and warm and very likable, with the exception of Justine, Archie's old girlfriend, who quickly went back to London.  It made me happy just to watch these really nice people in their beautiful countryside, working away at the struggles of their lives always helping one another out and coming out on top.

My love affair carried through Season II and into most of Season III.  About three quarters of the way through I found myself rooting for the people the show was obviously trying to make into the bad guys.  I got a little tired of the gollie (sp?) in his two-day stubble, uttering words of wisdom but I could deal with that.  Then, the very interesting and not unattractive bank officer. Stella, showed a softer side that endeared her to me.  I started pulling for her to win the heart of Archie although I knew she didn't have a chance with the writers.  Then...when one of the most adorable, colorful, clever characters was eliminated, I lost heart.

If only they had kept Hector and booted Lexie it would have been a perfect season and I'd look forward to the next one.  Now...I don't think I'll bother.",1364947200,2,1260,4.609865470852018
4371012,5,B004FUKLDC,My husband and I found this series a few years ago and fell in love with it. It is a great series. My in-laws have become addicted to the series as well. We gave series/season 3 as a Christmas gift to my mother-in-law. She enjoys it very much.,1359244800,,243,4.083333333333333
4371013,4,B004FUKLDC,"Series Three of Monarch of the Glen is one of the show's strongest seasons. All of the actors settle into their characters and come off as real people even when the writers saddle them with very cartoonish behaviors.
The introduction of Stella Moon (yes, that is the character's name) brings just the right amount of antagonism to the show. And the character herself, played by the wonderful Alexandra Gilbreath, displays both strength and vulnerability and thus comes off as a more fully developed person than is often seen in such a role.
Any fan of the show should add this season to their collection.",1334016000,2,604,4.8173076923076925
8428309,5,B004FUKLDC,"Been watching this series, very entertaining. Lots of comedy and no F bombs!",1495929600,,76,4.923076923076923
8428310,4,B004FUKLDC,"This is a 3.5 star. Season 3 continues to be funny, interesting, and charming but not as much as Season 1 and 2. Without giving anything away, a character I really like departs from the story (due to real-life events) and the character had such great chemistry with another character. (At this point, I am sounding really vague, but I don't want spoilers and those who have watched know what I am talking about.) The departure changes some things which I don't necessarily like. There is also tragedy in the last episode that makes things really change. However, I still encourage one to keep watching, because Season 3 definitely has its good points (Kilwillie a more prominent character being one of them!).",1473465600,,709,4.819672131147541
8428311,5,B004FUKLDC,"I totally love this Netflix series. I had to keep on watching watch different chapters because have a difficult time understanding the Scottish accented  English. I'm a Spanish speaking resident of the US, therefore much,  more difficult for me to understand the Scots, I have enjoyed these stories to the max. with all that great acting. and wish that  Netflix brings more stories about the cultures of Scotland.  Contrary to what some of the reviews say about the last seasons after  Hector, Katrina and Archie left,  I love  the complete series. Think the role of ""Paul"" became increasingly fun!  Aided by some of the original-series actors, he handled the transition from Archie to Paul extremely well, not an easy task.  Love it all!",1463011200,,738,4.934959349593496
8428312,5,B004FUKLDC,"Most wonderful stories of life in the Highlands, the father, mother, family, and their son who returns from the city to assist in running the old castle that needs renovation, the people who live and work there, who visit, the love stories, and how they attempt to keep the place going despite attempts by the bank to either take it over, or sell it. Magnicent actors, men, women, and animals. Love them all. Seen on BBC, and US public tv. Seldom shown now, so having the dvds is a must for me, as i am making my way thru buying them all.",1455494400,,538,4.284313725490196

8428315,5,B004FUKLDC,"If there were kindle books of this series, I would own them all.  My only complaint is the inevitable loss of favorite characters.  Scotland lives in all its rugged beauty forever in these priceless performances.  Well done, altogether outstanding and unforgettable.
