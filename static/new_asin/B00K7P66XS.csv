6404303,5,B00K7P66XS,"No subtitles on my DVD; however, there were subtitles on Netflix when I viewed it there on streaming Netflix.

I can't fault the seller, as it doesn't indicate that there are subtitles available for/on this DVD.

This has previously happened when I have viewed a program on websites and have liked so well and purchased, only to be disappointed that there are no subtitles on any of my players, including Laptops and computers.

In the case of this DVD, the subtitles are not missed, because I am familiar with the players in this documentary, but when a DVD has names of interest that you would like to understand a little better, or unintelligible words, then having no subtitles are important.  Well, to me, at least they are.

I enjoyed seeing Ry Cooder in this setting, as I did in Buena Vista Social Club which IMO is as good as this one - maybe better?",1436140800,2,859,4.5519480519480515

6404309,5,B00K7P66XS,This is the real deal; a German Count comes to America to find and preserve the artists who form the base on which all modern music is built. Chris Strachwitz is in it for the love of music and in his search finds the soul of America. This is a must see for all music lovers.,1425945600,2,275,3.9285714285714284
6404310,5,B00K7P66XS,This is a must see for anyone who loves music and cares about our roots in music.  Con't be a true lover of music if you can't appreciate the roots.  Well done video!

6404311,5,B00K7P66XS,"I collected and played Americana on California FM stations for many years, so when Mouse Music came out, I rushed to its showing at Hot Springs, Arkansas' Documentary Film Festival. I've seen them pretty much all, the docs about musicians and their life work -- but this one takes the (King) cake! A comprehensive, loving look at America's forgotten or ignored music, the mountain tunes and corridas, the Cajun  and Tex-Mex, the folk music of a huge, all-encompassing melting pot. A look also at Chris Strachwitz, who has documented, collected, recorded and sold the music these past sixty years -- a son of Silesian nobility, living in the Bay Area and completely in thrall to the culture our not-ready-for-prime-time field workers, domestics, drivers and miners created. This Ain't No Mouse Music is a look back into a country torn by racism and yet united by common goals, a look into the hard working soul of America, and its sound track is pure and lovely.

I am so glad to finally be able to watch it again and again and again ...",1420588800,9,1036,4.718232044198895
6404312,5,B00K7P66XS,"I can't believe this has only been released in Australia, which is where I viewed the film at Adelaide Film Festival... I was looking for a soundtrack, which would also be five star if I could only find it! Pure gold, this one.",1404086400,2,227,4.3023255813953485
6404313,5,B00K7P66XS,Great documentary of a true trail blazer with unwavering good taste in roots music.,1470009600,,83,5.0
6404314,5,B00K7P66XS,"Amazing documentary about a collector of traditional genres in American music, including lots of samples of music by the greats who produced them.  The breadth and quality of the music is fantastic. Takes you places you would probably never find on your own. I wanted to watch this over and over again and so ended up purchasing rather than renting it.",1469232000,,352,4.770491803278689
6404315,5,B00K7P66XS,"If you are into ""Americana"" or ""Roots"" music you will love this documentary. If the idea of washing your 78s in the kitchen sink by hand appeals to you then you will be unable to turn this off.",1459209600,,193,4.105263157894737

6404321,5,B00K7P66XS,"An absolutely riveting documentary which I found much more interesting than ""Muscle Shoals"" (as seen on PBS).  This deserves a much wider audience, which I hope will one day get to see it.  I confess to being pretty ignorant about music, it was a big gap in my education.  I got the DVD because of the local angle; Down Home Music and Arhoolie Records are local businesses, and we sometimes see Chris Strachwitz having dinner in a local restaurant.  I am pleased that this documentary is such top quality.",1438473600,,505,4.640449438202247

8656607,5,B00K7P66XS,"Chris Strachwitz has contributed mightily to the preservation of what has come to be called American roots music. He found and recorded several of our most important musicians in a variety of genres--blues, zydeco, old timey, Cajun, Texas-Mexico border, etc. etc. He worked closely with the great  filmmaker Les Blank, who filmed Lightnin' Hopkins, the Balfours, Clifton Chenier, et al. Testimony from Mance Lipscomb attests that he has been one of the relatively few totally respectful and honest brokers in the often less than stellar recording trade. The film is a delightful ride.",1522108800,,584,5.279569892473118
8656608,5,B00K7P66XS,"The most happy-making DVD ever.  After the emotionally-crushing experience of having to put my beloved dog down, I was beside myself with grief.  I punched my player on and heard that wonderful Dixieland march ""When the Saints..."" and really got what the celebratory funeral music is all about.  A great tribute to a man who tuned in to a unique piece of American culture to keep it alive through a time of tremendous change.",1515628800,,425,4.716216216216216
8656609,5,B00K7P66XS,"Very comprehensive film about the great founder of Arhoolie.  Strachwitz did a great service to the world of music by recording all these authentic people and different music genres.  The documentary has good archival footage and depth.  Not just a bunch of snippets of people making generic statements about things, like you get with documentaries sometimes.",1497484800,,359,5.375

8656614,5,B00K7P66XS,"So interesting; real people with a true love of music and culture who love to play, sing and generally entertain folks.  They were not in it for fame and fortune, however they enjoyed good lives and generally 'got by' experiencing travel, and were sometimes recognized by more elite musicians who helped advance careers by providing exposure to a broader audience.  Incredibly, produced, directed, etc..etc..etc. by a German immigrant who came to America following WWII with his family and fell in love with roots music such as French Acadian, zydeco, Tejano just to name a few.",1478217600,,578,5.073684210526316
