8664891,3,B00LAUMOD0,"Most of the films in ""Ben Turpin Returns"" are abridged versions and not the full film. Only the second half of ""Ten Dollars Or Ten Days"" and ""Out of Control"" is shown, and ""The Fickle Bridegroom"" is just snippets of the film, which I found difficult to follow. Full versions of these films may be viewed on YouTube. ""The Musical Marvel"" and ""Mr. Flip"" are the full versions. I would not recommend this DVD. The only reason I gave a rating of 3 instead of 1 is because Ben Turpin is so damn funny!

If you wish to purchase a DVD of Ben Turpin films, I would recommend ""Turpin Time"" or ""The Turpinator"". Both DVD's contain full length (two reeler) films.",1517702400,,652,4.3884297520661155
