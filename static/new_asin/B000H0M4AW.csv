2625001,4,B000H0M4AW,"Half way through this film I wasn't convinced. It seemed to be a pretentious attempt at poking fun at born-agains (and I'm not religious by any means). But by the end I was left unsettled and the film lingered on for days.

The twists are great and the the suspense builds up nicely. The acting is great all around (though Bernal should stick to Spanish-language films as his accent came out at parts and his mannerisms are very ""Mexico City-ish"").

If you are looking for something disturbing and thought-provoking, then this is worth a view.",1163548800,4,543,4.705263157894737
2625002,4,B000H0M4AW,"If you read the summary of THE KING I read before viewing it, you probably expected a heartwarming tale. A young man named Elvis finishes his stint in the Navy and decides to look up his father who abandoned him. The father has since changed his life, married, started a family, and is now a minister. Such a summary promises a conflict or two, but also redemption. Well, I don't want to spoil the experience for potential viewers, but let's just say that when it's on television, it won't be shown on the Hallmark Channel or the Family Channel. It's not a uplifting tale of sin and redemption, but it's still interesting to watch.

The film has its weaknesses, but it also has strengths that make it a gripping tale. Gael Garcia Bernal plays Elvis, the young man in search of his father. He's almost emotionless in the role, but this is intentional. If he pushed for the sympathy vote as the abandoned child or went the psychopath route, the film would be too unbelievable. Bernal keeps us interested in what Elvis' next move will be, and we wonder what is going on in his head but we're never certain. William Hurt plays David Sandow, the minister and family man who is also Elvis' father. Paul Dano of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE fame is the oldest son Paul, the apple of his father's eye who will soon graduate from high school and head to Bible college. Both Hurt and Dano work with the material, but one fault of the film is that we're introduced to some potentially wonderful conflictual situations between father and son (Paul), first son (Elvis) and beloved son (Paul), and conflict between the three, but they never materialize. The most troubling relationship in the film is that of Elvis and Malerie, the Sandow daughter. Malerie is a main character and some central situations revolve around her, but she's also the most fully developed character of the film. Pell James plays the young woman with sympathy and we believe she is conflicted, a young woman who is beginning to realize she's bigger than the life she's living but isn't ready to abandon it just yet.

For me, the best way to describe this film is interesting. It did not have enough conflict to make it engrossing, but it is well acted and the setting make us feel as if we're in the middle of the Bible Belt. I'm not sure if it's a watch again and again type of film, but still it's worthwhile and certainly makes the viewer think.",1163462400,21,2401,4.568445475638051
2625003,3,B000H0M4AW,"3.2 stars.  Really odd movie, not quirky as in cute or coy.  Elvis (Gael GB) straight out of the navy comes looking for his father whom he has never seen.  Father is William Hurt who is now a born-again preacher (which almost makes me want to stop watching) and in his pre-Christian days had sex with Elvis' Latina mother who was apparently a prostitute.  Hurt has a daughter and son from his Christian long-term monogamous marriage.

Elvis settles in to the town, gets a job and begins to court his half-sister.  She doesn't know Elvis is her half-brother and Elvis seems to just ignore this very crucial fact.  It gets steamy and after a time, Mallory is pregnant.  Elvis' half-brother is hip to the relationship but still doesn't know the blood connection to Elvis.  SPOILER:  When the brother comes to the motel to tell Elvis to stay away from his sister,  Elvis stabs him and then hides the crime.

THIS is where I felt the movie went off the rails.  There was no clue that such savage anger was in the Elvis character.  Even in the stabbing scene itself, it felt unreal or surreal or dream-like.  I didn't understand the chemistry between Elvis and Mallory--she was a wimpy and totally dull religious girl under the thumb of her autocratic father.  And with her innocence and religious background, how easily she succumbed to Elvis.  He didn't have to work very hard to seduce her.

With the loss of the son (who is believed to have left home to pursue his own agenda for living his life) Elvis is brought into the fold and Daddy makes a speech before his congregation and tells of his sin with Elvis' birth mother.  OK, this is Texas, so a lot has to be forgiven, but it was still too odd and the pieces just didn't fit.

I saw it to the end and the end is interesting--a leave 'em hanging kind of ending.  Surely repercussions would abound when Elvis tells Hurt the truth so he can ""get right with God.""  Where oh where in the movie did this conversion happen, when did Elvis begin to care about God?  Big missing piece.

It coulda been slam dunk brilliant but it was far less.  It lacked some kind of internal coherence and energy so it wasn't propelled forward, it just sort of dribbled along.  I think it's interesting that Gael GB and Hurt would choose this film as they both probably have tons of scripts thrown at them and can do just about what they like.  So whatever it was that walloped them in their gut and made them say yes to the project, somehow it didn't quite make it to the screen.",1161388800,8,2507,4.440789473684211
2625004,4,B000H0M4AW,"""The King"" is a haunting film from the studio that brought us ""Down in the Valley"" and features Gael Garcia Bernal ('Dot the I') and Oscar Winner William Hurt ('Kiss of the Spider Woman'). ""The King"" came and went pretty quietly. It got O.K. reviews (although Richard Roeper said that Hurt's performance was one of the best performances you'd see...Odd, since it's far from Hurts best) and slipped quietly onto DVD. It looked promising enough. The cover says ""Disturbing"" and the premice of the film sounded interesting. It's definitely a weird little movie. Bernal plays Elvis, a young man who is discharged from the Navy and heads to Texas to meet his father David (Hurt, covering up his trademark voice with a Texan accent). David is a pastor and is a borderline ""fire & brimstone"" kind of guy. He's married now to a woman named Tyla (Laura Harring) and has two kids Malerie (Pell James) and Paul (Paul Dano, 'Little Miss Sunshine'). David feels that Elvis was the product of past sinning and therefore, wants nothing to do with the boy. Elvis kind of moves on, but finds himself falling in love with Malerie. Even though we know it's, technically, incest. It's never really mentioned in the film. After Paul discovers that Elvis has been hanging around with his sister, he threatens to tell David and Elvis kills him. It's quick, shocking, and unexpected. Elvis quickly does what every movie character does; He ditches the body. As David searches for his ""lost"" son Paul and Malerie finds out that she's pregnant, David finds himself coming to terms with Elvis. The movie eventually throws a curveball and then ends abruptly. I didn't like the ending immediately, thinking ""that was cheap."" The ending works really well, I think the final line of dialogue sums up the movie pretty well. I've only seen Bernal in one other film, but he's very good here. Other actors could've played this role better, he left some gray areas...But other than that, he's really good. As for Hurt, he's fantastic. As I said, it's not his best performance but it's really good. He gives an Oscar worthy performance, but will probably be forgotten come Oscar time because of how low-key this film was. The movie is a little bit haunting (especially the ending), but I didn't find it disturbing. If you found movies like ""Rivers Edge"" or ""American Beauty"" disturbing, you might find this movie disturbing...But, I don't know. I didn't feel disturbed. It's not a masterpiece, but it was worth the watch.

2625005,5,B000H0M4AW,"THE KING is a film that is bound to polarize audiences: it is a disturbing, brilliantly written and executed film that viewers will love or hate.  This viewer found the work mesmerizingly addictive, one of the more exciting works of cinematic art to come out this year.  Writer Milo Addica ('Monster's Ball', 'Birth') and director James Marsh have created an almost impossible story to tell and in selecting a cast of superb actors have managed to make the unthinkable thinkable.

Elvis Valderez (the sensitive and amazingly gifted Gael Garca Bernal) is being discharged from the Navy  as the story begins. He leaves his ship with his duffle bag and his rifle and begins his life as a citizen.  After an awkward encounter with a prostitute he sets out on a bus to Corpus Christi, Texas to meet the father he never knew (his mother was a prostitute who got pregnant on duty and gave birth to Elvis, living in poverty with her only child and then dying before Elvis entered the Navy).
He arrives in Corpus Christi, buys an old car, drives to the church where is father Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt in clearly one of his finest roles) leads his tacky congregation in evangelical tones accompanied by his son Paul (Paul Dano 'Little Miss Sunshine', 'The Ballad of Jack and Rose', 'L.I.E.' etc) playing the rock guitar. The pastor's family includes a wife Twyla (Laura Harring) who seems unhappy yet committed to the life of a pastor's wife, and young daughter Malerie (Pell James), a plain Jane whose flat affect reads as one who desires sense and change from her world as a controlled pastor's daughter.

Elvis confronts his father who does not know him and the pastor informs Elvis that his birth came at a time before he found Jesus: he lets Elvis know a bastard son is unwanted.  Elvis meets Malerie, courts her, and despite all consequences Malerie and Elvis couple.  Elvis works as a pizza delivery boy (his boss Bruno is played by writer Milo Addica), rents a tacky motel room, and devotes his attentions to Malerie (despite the fact that pastor David has forbidden his contact with the family).  Malerie becomes pregnant and tells Elvis she loves him - probably the first time anyone has ever confessed love for him.  Paul visits Elvis's motel room advising him to stay away from his family and Elvis pulls a knife on Paul accidentally leading to his death. Elvis covers his tracks, disposing of the body in the river. He only confesses his act to Malerie who prays with Elvis for God's forgiveness and lets it settle. The rest of the Sandow family think Paul has run away (he and his father argued over one of Paul's songs not using the Bible as lyrics to a simple tune meant to convince the school and public of Intelligent Design versus Evolution) and place signs throughout the town to recover him.  Pastor David watches Elvis mop floors in the pizza parlor, tells him he wants to talk and the two take a ride - where the pastor teaches his 'son' how to shoot with bow and arrow and tells him of his miscreant past.  Elvis is invited to dinner at the pastor's home, then to live in Paul's room much against Twyla's feelings, and eventually the pastor introduces Elvis to his congregation as his 'son in sin'.  The family doesn't cope and the ending begins to spin out of control as events quite bizarre and lurid take place, seemingly all to the end of Elvis at last feeling he belongs to the father he never knew. To reveal the ending would greatly diminish the emotional impact of the film.

Gael Garca Bernal handles this role with such emotional dexterity and finesse that at no time does he lose our compassion despite the horrors that engulf his plight.  He is simply stunning in every way, an actor of tremendous depth and talent and a screen presence that is utterly commanding.  Likewise William Hurt makes this Pastor understandable and despite his exceedingly religious right evangelical manner, he allows us to see motivation for his actions.  Pell James, Paul Dano, and Laura Harring complete the quintet of players with polished skill.  Director James Marsh knows exactly how to make this tough story work and his pacing and camera and music choices are exactly on target.  For this reviewer this film is one that will linger in the mind indelibly.  Such a shame that the subject matter may prevent a large audience from seeing one of the best films of the year.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, October 06",1160611200,,4434,4.694193548387097
2625006,5,B000H0M4AW,"The writing, directing, acting, etc. is excellent. The story believable. My only complaint is sometimes good actors whisper & the audio wasn't adjusted properly, so you will have to keep adjusting it. Sadly, this is a true-to-life type of film. I wouldn't show it to someone who has mental illness issues. It might be good for parents to show it to their teens, (tweens?) & explain some safety issues with them. I don't want to give up the story, but safety issues:
1) Your daughters should know that it's unsafe to run off alone with (even sometimes when there's two or three friends) with a stranger. No matter how cute & sweet he is...There are girls who have gotten murdered this way, even from a 'friend' of the family.
2) Your kids should not go to a stranger's home, even the boys. Never threaten someone because they might be demented enough to murder you.
3) Never invite a stranger to live in your home, even if it's a relative. You have to get to know them first or your family could be in grave danger. It sounds harsh, but too many families have been hurt by this...
4) If you lie about your past or present life, it will come back to bite you in the behind. I've seen some Christians do this. It's called living a lie & from a Christian perspective that opens the door to the devil. Some folks call it karma.
Overall, I believe you will like this film, especially if you are a fan of Gael Bernal.",1359158400,2,1410,4.385496183206107
2625007,2,B000H0M4AW,"The movie was kind of ""weird"", but that's a film issue, not Amazon's.  Your service was great and no problems, but the product/DVD had a pause in it where it wouldn't move forward until I pushed the Forward button on my remote control several times---I believe the DVD was scratched.

2625008,1,B000H0M4AW,"James Marsh, the writer and director of this film admits to the great influence of watching horror movies and the yearning to see sex, nudity, blood and violence, orgies and devil worship. The main character captures what the Bible describes, ""The thief (the devil) comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I (Jesus) have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.""

2625009,5,B000H0M4AW,"When it comes to your life three things can be counted on, what you fear will appear, what you resist will persist, and what you disown will come home.  Rarely are those principles better illustrated to dramatic effect than in The King.

William Hurt plays the part of the respectable preacher, and Gael Garcia Bernal, the illegitimate former soldier son, seeking acknowledgment and love.  When the preacher disowns this son by a relationship with a prostitute years before, the son then remorselessly sabotages him leaving a trail of destruction and criminal behavior which goes undetected.

The preacher has the preferred legitimate son, echoes of Cain and Abel, the naive beautiful virgin teenage daughter whom he wishes to seduce, and the attractive wife.  All these things come under threat in this relentless pursuit, as this movie unfolds with gripping, surprising and extreme turns. If the legitimate son is out of the picture will the father accept him? Will he be stopped before it's too late, or will he destroy everything that matters to to the preacher?

It's also reminiscent of the Frankenstein story, where the doctor refuses to acknowledge  his creation, and the monster destroys all that is light in his life.  Undoubtedly, a powerful movie, some may find it scary, and you may wonder at the end what would have happened if the son had been accepted from the beginning.

I liked this movie when I saw it in theatre, and just because it was not a big Hollywood extravaganza does not mean that it's not a very worthwhile movie.

I think you will enjoy this gripping movie, which i highly recommend, and I hope you found this review helpful.",1252108800,6,1656,4.882142857142857
2625010,4,B000H0M4AW,"After being discharged from the Navy, a disturbed young man named Elvis (Gael Garcia Bernal) seeks out his father, whom he has never met. When his father (William Hurt), now a preacher, rejects him, Elvis seeks revenge on his father through his father's new family.

""The King"" is a ""horror"" movie, but not in the sense that you are probably used to. According to the ""letter from the director"", that is included in the DVD case of this movie, ""The King"" was partially inspired by the horror movies that the director saw in his youth, including ""Brimstone and Treacle"", a film about a strange young man who makes his way into the family of a middle-aged writer. That plot is pretty much the same as that of ""The King"" (except the bit about the writer), but to call this film a ""horror"" film would be misleading. The term ""horror"" usually evokes images of supernatural monsters or knife-wielding maniacs. Elvis is not a maniac and he is very much a human being. What this film deals with is the horrors that human beings are capable of, given the right (or wrong) circumstances.

I can imagine that this film might not be to everyone's tastes. It is slow moving to begin with, and the subject matter is often unpleasant (including the incestuous relationship that forms between Elvis and his half-sister). However, if you're not put off by the plot description, it is a well written and well acted movie (Hurt is in his best role in years and Bernal is always excellent) that takes some interested turns along the way. It's definitely worth giving a try.",1242172800,2,1553,4.664233576642336
2625011,4,B000H0M4AW,"Gael Garcia Bengal has proved over and over again how fine a actor he is. I got lost in this performance because he effortlessly played a character of little sympathy. I almost missed that he was playing a sociopath.

I couldn't quite understand his choice and perspicuous leaving from the army. Elvis the character Mr. Bengal was playing; it was not clear why he left the army. The subliminal choice of joining may have been for the regiment and officious nature of the army. My supposition is that a sociopath least best place is in the army during war.

To return to the bulk of the story without giving it away. Elvis basically is in search of his biological father. Played with profundity by William Hurt, one of his best rolls in years. This journey is rather roundabout; eventually his relationship is known and the film jumps in high gear. Mr. Bengal as usual is worth the price of a movie or DVD.",1239494400,,905,4.54601226993865
2625012,5,B000H0M4AW,"Other reviwers have noted that,Down In The Valley,  provides a template for this one and is a and superior film. I can't agree, pacing and believablity in the pathology of the two lead types are only distant relatives.  I  found this a brilliantly disturbing tale...and I hadn't seen trailers or even read the jacket! Without repeating the story, which reviewers seem to feel the need to do, the kernel of the tension resides in the very ambivalence of Bernal's performance. It is never really clear where the depth of his pathology is rooted, and therefore the scope of his ambitions. It's a marvellously nuanced performance. How far will he go towards seducing his dad's daughter by the lake? Will he top the geek Creationist half-brother when confronted in his seedy motel room? And the look of consummate satisfaction as he raids the fridge of his dad's house after a life-time of exclusion! then there's the marvellous moment of the girl's dawning awareness of the implications of her relationship with Elvis, mid-congregation, as the dad spills his heart. James Marsh's direction has graceful timing throughout. The camera work dollying around the garden prior to the bedroom scene of the double murder is a thrilling stroke, and an unexpected tenderness where we presume gratuitous violence will pour forth. I thought the finale down the corridors of Fundamentalist power were right on and the look of bewilderment on Hurt's face, just the moment worth waiting for. I doubt he's be returning to his flock to absolve himself through public confession and accept Elvis for cleaning up. Quite a punchy movie.",1236988800,4,1612,5.0299625468164795

2625014,1,B000H0M4AW,"As a latecomer to this film I just happened upon it in the Used DVD section of a local music store the other day, and I eagerly purchased it while being curious how this Pastor's family tale would unwrap itself, no pun intended.

To say that I was and still am disturbed by the story is to write the obvious, not to mention a bit cliche judging by some reviews I've read for this film.  The long lost son is looking for his father who rejects him right off the bat, which makes for some interesting and deeply sad foundation to the story....something which I was very moved by being that I am a product of the Christian Church and even a seminary graduate....how I was trying to rewrite the story on-the-spot that Elvis was hugged and embraced by the pastor and courageously welcomed into the congregation!  ( That is the true love of God, the forgiveness and grace of Christ that I wanted to see shown through this pastor, yet I was also intrigued by the very real possibility and humanity of the pastor being ashamed and protective and hypocritical....so I was not in the least bit turned off by this film portraying that ).  So, even before that meeting between said Elvis and Pastor the former ""son"" had already taken a liking to the pastor's daughter,Mallory...and he moves in for the kill, pun intended, when he later defends his right to be with her (after manipulating her and crossing her boundaries, romantically and sexually) by killing off Mallory's brother who has come to protect her  (protecting her innocence and/or maybe he thinks this Elvis guy is ""shady"" unlike the filmmakers' commentary that the pastor's family just had fear towards the Elvis guy so they wanted to eliminate him----which is an obvious blanket prejudice of the filmmakers which I do not support---if someone were following my car home from church to give my husband/father a ""hug"" and I didn't know who that person was you better believe that I'd wonder if this person was very hurt/needy or perhaps unstable or perhaps even dangerous...that's not a bad thing, but being wise and discerning, aka Street-Smarts!) Anyway, I digress.

I don't know what is more disturbing about this film: the fact that the filmmakers stated that some people saw Elvis as ""not bad"" OR the ""fairy tale"" music that permeated some creepy scenes of Elvis fairly graphically ""making love"" to Mallory (he is 21 and she's 16, so it's statutory rape, yes?!) OR that this sweet music (kind of Motherspaugh-esqe a la ""Bottle Rocket"") is continuing through scenes where the pastor is unknowingly taking Elvis under his arm (with the kind of love he SHOULD have shown at the outset) while his missing son, who Elvis has killed, is still manipulated from the pastor's understanding by Elvis' cruel, lying ways OR how he clued Mallory in to how her brother died by lying to her (""he threatened me""...oh, poor baby) OR how Elvis abused Mallory's trust by praying with her for God's forgiveness AND lying to God in his prayer!?  I mean, Elvis was one sick mutha...so was that music chosen as a kind of pseudo-artistic means towards irony....I am wondering if the filmmakers are a little sick in the head...if irony was the slant, then they did a very poor job of showing contrast in that regard...that did NOT work at all.  And in their commentary at the end they stated, in a surprised tone, that people thought Elvis looked mad AS IF he was gonna do something bad to the pastor AFTER he had killed of Mallory and her mother!?  Give me a gigantic break!  Elvis was on his way to becoming a serial killer, wasn't he?  Are we supposed to be so sympathetic towards him AFTER he played God (not really what God would do) by murdering now 3 people and burning down the house then going to the pastor's office to ""get right""?  He ultimately showed his true colors...that he cared more about himself than Mallory or her brother or her mother or his father/pastor or the honor of his mother...he truly disrespected her ( but God the most) in committing these grave acts!

Seldom do I not recommend films, but this is one of those times. While I found the acting to be solid, the storyline and disturbing commentary and directing decisions (to show the bare breast of a ""16 year-old"" while Elvis was grinding away) led me towards a rejection of the film.  Believe me, I am no prude, but to passively portray the sick behavior in the film as just a part of ""everyone has something wrong with them"", something to that effect that the filmmakers stated, as if there is a moral/immoral equivalence throughout all the characters, is just plain rubbish and cowardly, in my opinion.

Why not have the courage to draw out the drama of Elvis' horrible/terrible acts against more sinister or troubling music?  Why not draw out the contrast of Elvis' criminal behavior against the devastating realization that the pastor was a part of Elvis' deep pain and loss of his father in his life? ( Who wouldn't want to see William Hurt act out the complexity of mourning the loss of his family, feeling the rage towards Elvis, and grieving his previous ""sin"" of seeing a prostitute and having a son he didn't know about for 21 years? ) No, it seems like the filmmakers put the resulting burden subtly back on the pastor, like it's really his fault----as if they were indirectly telling us, ""Well, ya know, he was never there for Elvis, then rejected him, so really what Elvis did was basically, pretty much that Christian pastor's fault.""  Whoops, maybe I just opened a can of worms....was this film in the end a knock against ""religious"" folks and/or Christians?  Maybe.  If so, do the filmmakers have the courage to admit that?  I think not.

So, in the spirit of the film, I ""courageously"" recommend this film.....NOT!",1212710400,5,5746,4.674925668979188

2625017,4,B000H0M4AW,"Spanish actor Gael Garcia Barnel, whom American audiences know from ""Motorcycle Diaries"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien,"" turns in a credible performance as a young American just out of the Navy, who tracks down the man (William Hurt) who once fathered him out of wedlock. Now married with teenage children and pastor of a large congregation in Corpus Christi, the man is in no mood to accept a son conceived in sin, and his refusal sets in motion a kind of murderous vendetta that is played out in the rest of the film.

Once you accept the premise of the story, the unexpected and sometimes implausible turns of plot take on an unavoidable inevitability, all the way to its abrupt ending. In an age of embarrassing revelations about the personal lives of high-profile church leaders, this film has a currency for viewers both in and out of the Bible Belt. Behind the blissful appearances, this particular preacher's family is unspeakably troubled, so much so that mother and daughter seem submerged in a grim silence, ready to bristle with resistance to the man who rules their lives. Meanwhile, his son, openly admired in public, draws his rebuke by revealing something of the boy's own personal anguish during a Sunday morning service. Barnel's Elvis (the ""King"" of the title) becomes a sweet-faced angel of vengeance, and when he's done there is virtually nothing left undone.

When Sandow tells Elvis to stay away from his family, he doesn't realize what he's brought upon his family.

This film is full of remarkable performances. Paul Dano (Ballad of Jack and Rose, Little Miss Sunshine) is a young Christian fundamentalist pushing to get intelligent design into the school curriculum. Every time this guy appears in a film, his characters are well-developed and totally unique. He's perfect in The King. Pell James, as the object of Elvis's affection is equally awesome. William Hurt's Pastor Sandow is an amazing character creation and worthy of an Oscar-nomination.

Like Monster's Ball (one of the writer's of this wrote Monster's Ball), The King is terribly depressing, but worth watching for the moving story and performances. There's a lot of sex and violence interspersed through this dark story. You may not find yourself wanting to watch it again and again, though. The most interesting part of the film is the examination of Pastor Sandow's faith and how he uses it to deal with the events that occur. The phrase ""I need to get right with God."" will never sound the same to you again, after viewing this film.",1168300800,3,1355,4.861471861471862
2625021,5,B000H0M4AW,"""The King"" is a movie that unwinds effortlessly before your eyes, gliding like a river through the depths of a Corpus Christi summer.  An entrancing palette of emerald green lawns and cool blue refinery lights combines with a chiming, dulcimer-laden soundtrack to mesmerizing effect.  The film lulls and soothes, until after watching, when you are forced to reflect on the mayhem you have just witnessed.

Then, too, there is something very oddly familiar about this tale of woe, which seems to obliquely refer to several Biblical stories.

William Hurt would seem to be the titular ""King"".  He plays David Sandow, the authoritarian pastor of a prosperous Evangelical church in Corpus Christi,  the leader of a large ""flock"", and a prideful man.  He lives a very affluent life with a beautiful suburban home, a lovely wife (Laura Haring, who literally disappears into her role),  and two beautiful, obedient teen-age children.  Interestingly enough, he seems more like a Medieval king than a Christian one.  The symbol that reigns in his home isn't a cross, it's a high-powered hunting bow.

David Sandow is hiding a secretive past, which comes back to haunt him in the form of ""Elvis"" (Gael Garcia Bernal), a son that was born out of his union ( in the days before he was ""saved"") with a Mexican prostitute.
Freshly discharged from the Navy,  Elvis seems to have no other purpose in life than to claim his rightful inheritance as a part of the pastor's family.

Biblically, the character of Elvis would seem to refer to the ""Prodigal Son"" as well as to the story of Jacob (""the Supplanter"").  But Elvis is an oddly vacant character, sort of a borderline personality who has no moral center.  He is a drifter possessed of a kind of animalistic grace,  and when David Sandow bars him from his church and his home, retributions occur--again, in sort of a pre-ordained, Biblical fashion.  Elvis lays with Malerie ( Sandow's daughter),  kills Sandow's  son,  and having effectively covered his tracks,  eventually  replaces the ""good son"" in Sandow's home.  But the tragedy continues to play out, and further consequences are in store...

There are just a multitude of things to recommend this movie.  The actors are all excellent in their roles--especially Hurt, as Sandow, and Pell James as Sandow's daughter.

Bernal, as Elvis,  will definitely remind veteran movie-watchers of young Martin Sheen, in ""Badlands""  (where Sheen played a character based on murderer Charles Starkweather.)

Other subtexts in ""The King""  reveal themes that were present in movies like ""Lone Star"", and ""The Border"", two other films that were set in Texas.  ""The King"",  with its pointed references in the musical score to Tex-Mex and Mexican music, like the aforementioned movies seems to be making comments about the relationship of the two cultures ( another way in which Elvis can be seen as a threatening heir.)

Five stars for a masterfully woven, sneaky-good movie.",1168041600,8,2949,5.014432989690722
2625022,5,B000H0M4AW,"i loved this film. it is incredibly daring, in the vein of ""Badlands"" its relentless but true to tragedy.  it will keep you thinking about it for days to come.  Also Gael Garcia Bernal who plays the lead is an amazing actor and the love story will break your heart.",1167177600,7,265,4.28
2625023,2,B000H0M4AW,"Okay, here's the issue I have.  While I love the whole idea of creating a film that makes you think, that makes you second guess yourself and your beliefs and your entire philosophy of life, and while I love endings that leave you with more than a mere ambiguous answer to your many questions I still have trouble enjoying this film for the mere fact that I fail to see a point amidst all it's originality.

I kept trying to at least assign a motive to the central character of Elvis (Gael Garcia Bernal) or at least an ounce of humanity but I couldn't and still can't.  His actions, while repulsive, could have been at least slightly justifiable if he had only hinted towards a reason, hinted towards anything really.  I found his character more than just ominous; he was void of everything but animal lust.

I guess that's my main problem with this film, for while it presents itself like that small indie with a message it fails to relay that message properly.  Films like this are best a canvas for human relationships and the dark demons in us all but `The King' fails to reveal any layers in its stock of characters.

The only person I felt remotely connected with was Twyla (Laura Harring), for she was the only character who showed real emotion.  Even Gael and Hurt failed to capitalize on their acting abilities (as we all know they have them) and instead delivered almost flat performances.  If the movie was just given a pulse, a reason to exist, then I could begin to try and care about it, but it has no pulse, it has no meaning and thus it delivers just that, nothing.",1165276800,8,1582,4.465277777777778
2625024,5,B000H0M4AW,I thought this movie was brilliant. I bet a lot of people hated the ending. But I loved it. I've never thought about a movie so much after it was over.

It's dark and disturbing and I'll probably never watch it again.",1428278400,,324,4.35
8135609,4,B000H0M4AW,"Reminiscent of a Flannery O'Connor short story, this beautifully filmed, well-acted drama is a vehicle for great actors to practice their art.  Far from pleasant, and redemption elusive, the first viewing of The King is likely to shock and upset.  While the main character commits one atrocity after another, and renders the story unbelievable as a ""true-to-life narrative,"" the film avoids clich, and does paint true-to-life tableaus of southern protestant Christianity (without damning it), and of a psychopath who finds no discernible remorse for his crimes.  It's easy to understand why critics were divided in their assessment of The King.  It is NOT a film I recommend to the faint of heart.  However, if you value Southern Gothic literature, and excellent filmmaking, then The King is a film well worth your time.",1417824000,,820,5.181818181818182

Even Gael Garcia Bernal, normally a nuanced performer, comes off as a one-dimensional near psychopath.

8135613,4,B000H0M4AW,"I'm pretty sure I wrote some review about this movie a few years ago, but oh well...

This movie really surprised me because I wasn't expecting to like it at all. I had never heard of Gael Garcia Bernal, and figured he'd just been some random, untalented actor. I was blown away by his and everyone else's performances. I really liked the feel of normalcy you get from the characters and the situation. I found myself saying to myself, ""Darn, except for a few twists and turns this could actually be someone's family/life!""

So, what happens in the movie one might say? Bernal plays Elvis who has just been discharged from the Navy. He wants to go to Texas to find his father. Well, that doesn't turn out well at all because daddy doesn't want to claim Elvis for various reasons. Elvis stays in Texas, near his father, finds a job, and meets a girl. What could be wrong with that, except everything!

One slowly sees that even though Elvis shows no real feelings about being rejected by his father, everything that Elvis is doing is due to rage and wanting to get even with his father. Basically, Elvis is a sweet psychopath who looks damn adorable doing very bad things.",1387843200,,1171,4.540284360189573

8135615,5,B000H0M4AW,"Very tough film. Leaves you speculating about how hurt, shame, and anger might lead to horrible tragedy.

There was this intense sense of foreboding under a quiet surface and so very  much was left to the empathetic imagination. This was all quite well done as films go and keeps you involved despite very little dialogue or displays of emotion. Of course not everyone likes this sort of film. Almost a certain type of ""European.""

You are never quite sure what is going on inside of the people but there is plenty of context and time for some serious thinking.

All in all this was pretty terrific film making and some very nice photography.

On the other hand what was happening was disgusting and very sad and one wonders if there is very much point in making a film that is virtually over the top in revolting implications about the lengths that someone might go to get get revenge and deal with his pain and hunger for love (without getting dramatic and hysterical on the screen).

Did we need the heavy religious context?? I did not see it as being about religious hypocrisy on the part of the pastor. I thought that he came across as a sincere Christian, more sincere than many.

PLOT SPOILER:

In the end the boy asks the pastor for help getting God's forgiveness. It raises so many questions about the psychology of the people we have just seen. Is the pastor  sincere enough to see the hurt and thirst for love in his son and put aside his own feelings to help him? For that matter is the boy so mistrustful of his father that only his help in forgiveness can prove his love to the kid?  Or is he just tormenting the father and stirring up the deepest emotions and conflicts? I don't think there is any way to know but the ending in any event raises important issues in a religious and psychological context.

Presumably Jesus would love and understand the sinner and forgive him as Jesus forgave his persecutors. Was the pastor up to that? Personally I started to get the idea that he might be. In part this is because I was starting to feel that he felt that he needed to redeem himself for bringing a life into the world that he was not prepared to help and care for. Probably not everyone will agree with me.

Was the kid sincere in seeking his father's help? I suspect he was because he had hit rock bottom in his depravity. He was not a maniac or sociopath, He just made a series of very, very terrible mistakes because of his pain and youth that brought out the worst in him. Young people actually do sometimes get deeply into trouble because of intense confused feelings. This would be believable.

However we are not given clear answers and we can only ponder life. I liked that though this was a tough film to watch and for me personally much of it was disgusting to be thinking about. But then so much of the human condition is disgusting to think about.

The extra features were just okay, not terrible, not great. Probably they did want to leave the film open to personal interpretations.",1381017600,,3011,4.470802919708029
