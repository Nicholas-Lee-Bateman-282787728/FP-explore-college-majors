8084873,3,B000BBOUHW,"Based on cover art alone, the best picture here is ""Dr. Jekyll..."" The 1931 Rouben Mamoulian-directed version of this Robert Louis Stevenson story is definitely one of its best adaptations.

What's left of this set is rather pedestrian: ""The Brain..."" and ""Killer Shrews"" are both low-budget drive-in movie double feature material, while ""Zombies"" is a WWII era 'B' pic that was once advertised thusly: ""HUMAN SACRIFICES! SAVAGE TORTURE! VOODOO RITES!""

One can only hope so....

Another interesting small collection of vintage scary movies is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FRIGHT-NIGHT-10-MOVIE-PACK/dp/B000BBOUH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FRIGHT NIGHT 10 MOVIE PACK</a>, from MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT.
