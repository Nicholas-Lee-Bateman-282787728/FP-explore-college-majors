2604018,1,6303651542,"These are illegal copies of the American releases. They are recorded on D5 discs as opposed to the standard dual-layer type used for commercial retail. There are at least two versions of this box set on the market with identical packaging. Because of the quality loss which occurs when transferring D9 recordings to D5 discs, some of the bonus features have been removed to reduce the video pixelation that occurs when compression exceeds a certain percentage. As for the scripting, it's not Japanese Kanji as another reviewer noted. It's Chinese. If you want a product from the country that leads the world in DVD piracy, look no further. Otherwise, save your money.",1163894400,54,667,4.964285714285714
2604019,4,6303651542,"This DVD set is the Asian release with foreign language menus converted to NTSC.  It is fully compatible with American Region 1 DVD players.  These DVDs are the official original versions (not Collector's Editions) compressed by dvcc, inc. (California, USA), but intended for sale in Asia on a PAL system with Region 2 (Japan) DVD players, but they have been converted to NTSC and Region 1 DVD.  The only audio track on the movies is in English (optional English commentary on some), although Japanese subtitles are on by default.  (Just use your DVD's subtitle button to select English subtitles and/or turn them off.)

This is the only way to get all the James Bond DVDs to date in one collection.  This set doesn't have ""Never Say Never Again,"" but that title is not an official James Bond release.  It is rather a remake of Thunderball (movie #4) resurrecting Sean Connery as James Bond for one last hurrah 18 years later.  That one was released by Warner Brothers instead of MGM, and I believe there was copyright confusion during its creation.

These DVDs don't come in individual DVD cases, but rather in a set of soft plastic sleeves (akin to audio CD traveling cases) contained within a large standard-sized box with a magnetic flap.  This saves on space, but if you're worried about scratches and the display, I recommend buying some DVD cases for a low price from any online retailer (just Google ""DVD Cases"") and printing the cover art from the listings on Amazon.  The plastic sleeves hold the DVDs quite well and are intended to be flipped through vertically like a calendar (or alternately right-to-left) instead of left-to-right like a book.

The box and the DVD labels have Asian (Japanese?) writing on them in addition to the English, but don't be fooled--this is an NTSC set for use on concurrent North American Region 1 DVD players.  The menus are in Japanese, but it's not very difficult to work around that.  The first menu option is ""Play movie,"" the second one is unselectable for some reason (web content?), the third is ""Setup"" and the fourth is ""Chapters.""  To find the proper subtitles, just start the movie and use your remote's Subtitle button.  The same applies to selecting the audio commentary or surround sound options (Audio button).

This DVD set comes with a little booklet giving a summary of each movie in both Japanese and English.  Some of the English in the booklet has typos, e.g. ""...villainous criminal who's holding millions hostaeg [sic] and threatening...""  The underside of the box's entrance flap also has Japanese summaries, but I fully intend to print English summaries to paste over them.

Overall, I'd say this is a very worthwhile collection.  (And what a price!)  Although the foreign box and menus are a bit of an inconvenience, these are still the same movies with the same English audio track.  It's well worth the slight inconvenience to get everything in one set for such a low price, and I highly recommend it for anybody interested in the James Bond series.",1161734400,33,3020,4.832684824902723
2604020,1,6303651542,This is the worst DVD collection I've ever bought! The DVD's are selfburned and with cheap stickers on it! The menue of the DVDs is only in chinese! This product in my personal opinion is illegal!,1160697600,30,196,4.472222222222222

2604022,5,6303651542,"Sean Connery is at his peak in these great movies where all of the best traits in James Bond come out such as calmness under pressure, libido, and every other trait a good secret agent should have so buy this movie",961459200,,214,4.2439024390243905
2604023,4,6303651542,"First off, the literature is very unclear: These are widescreen, English, and Region 1.

I've been a Bond fan ever since I was a boy. I'm 52 today. Over the years, I've collected the movies on beta, then VHS, and now DVD. I never had all of them at once, and except for the new Craig movies, only had one other on DVD.

Then this came along! I'm not through them all, but the Connery's and Moore movies are finished. And, I finally have Lazenby's presentation! I never was able to get that one in any format.

As far as the DVD's go. The older movies aren't the greatest quality and not in 5.1 as the jackets suggest. But, when you consider how old they are, and that stereo didn't exist at that time, they're fine. As you walk up the ladder in years, the picture and the sound quality get much better. The one thing I've always loved about the Bond films are the opening credits, the naked ladies and the great songs. In fact, these are the only movies I ever watch the credits at all. The songs are fantastic in 5.1, wow!

If you're a Bond fan, this set it a must have; and you save money buying all three sets at one time. The films aren't in order in each set, but by having all three at once, you can put them in order.

Only four stars?  Well, yeah; I kept a star out because of the so, so quality of the older films.

In this day and age, there are many digital houses that could have cleaned them up. An great example would be the movie A Night to Remember. While a 1950's era Titanic movie in black and white, this movie went to the digital house. While still black and white, the picture quality looks like the movie was filmed yesterday, it's that sharp.  It would have been nice to see the same attention to detail for the James Bond movies.  And it can't be about money either, if they can do it for every Star Trek TV episode, 77 of them, they certainly could have done this for James Bond.

But all in all, A MUST HAVE!",1256947200,6,1934,4.147058823529412
2604024,5,6303651542,"For Bond fans, no description of the plots, acting, or special effects and stunt work are necessary.  This DVD collection, however, is outstanding for all the extras that go along with the movies.  There is extensive commentary and behind the scenes material on the DVD's, as well as written material that tells you everything you want to know about the actors and how the movies came about.  It's a little disconcerting, but very interesting, to see the stars in interviews made 40 years after the movies.  A lot of money and talent goes into the visual and auditory qualities of the movies, and the technical quality of the discs doesn't disappoint.  This collection gets an enthusiastic thumbs up.",1250035200,19,700,4.898305084745763

these to anybody who wants the full collection at a discounted price!",1175385600,2,275,4.46
2604029,5,6303651542,"I cant believe anyone would complain about this set. I just got a brand new one including Casino Royale and its great. I have bought many Asian import DVDs from eBay and here and have not had a problem. Most of these are factory made and NOT bootlegs or pirated copies. They are simply made in China for mass distribution in all players. Just because you have an option to buy something at a good price instead of being a blind consumer and making the rich corporations even richer, is certainly no reason to complain. You should be thankful you live somewhere that gives you that opportunity at all.

These discs play the same, sound and picture are the same, they are always in English and they are basically the same sets, just with a different package and sometimes other languages on the boxes and discs.

You are not gonna get better for your money, so why complain when it ISNT illegal!",1175385600,5,893,4.506172839506172

FYI - my ""region 1 & 2"" collection came in a small box, and the DVDs are NOT boxed individually...they're in plastic sleeves within the ""collection"" box.",1167436800,10,562,4.544554455445544
