6497585,1,B00LOVBXAA,"A stupid Christian analysis of a scientific theory that's still evolving and taking a shape of more knowable idea. If we don't have all the answers, I assure you that we have no answers in the mythological book ""The Bible"".",1482883200,7,223,4.6
6497586,5,B00LOVBXAA,"I think the director tries hard to make the Creationists' views seem reasonable, but it's nearly impossible to do so. I am grateful for the education, though, because I didn't know that many fundamentalists actually believe the earth is only 6000 years old. I didn't know that they explain dinosaur fossils by picturing Noah leading all those dinosaurs into the Ark. The romantic legends of heroic knights slaying dragons and rescuing fair damsels is properly explained when we understand that those dragons were really dinosaurs who Noah fed and cared for.

Had enough yet? Yes, it takes a pretty strong stomach to take views like this seriously. The Catholics persecuted Galileo for similar reasons, since they were sure that his view of the solar system contradicted the Biblical view, and therefore the Biblical view must be correct. Why, oh why must Christians make science into an enemy, thereby encouraging anyone who can actually think to ridicule them?

Personally, I think it's from the sin of pride (on the part of the fundamentalists). They pridefully think they actually can come close to understanding the mind of God. (I kept wanting to quote the ending of the book of Job to them.) Their small minds are obsessed with historical facts and literal truth, and the Bible is concerned with life and death things that really matter.

Can't God have created everything the way science says it happened, millions of years ago? And can't God intervene today, in response to prayer, whenever He wants to, even if He created the world by big bangs and evolution? And if not, then why not? The only reason the Creationists don't like this more scientific explanation is because the Creationists' God is too small. They've pridefully put Him into such a little box that they think they can explain Him perfectly. But Darwin had the last word in the movie. He said that for us to even try to understand the mind of God is like a dog trying to understand the mind of Newton.",1453939200,6,1976,4.823008849557522
6497587,5,B00LOVBXAA,"This documentary is mischaracterized; it was not, in my humble opinion, produced to advocate evolution, but, instead to show that Darwin was a kind, gentle man who wrestled with his theory of evolution and his belief in God. The former won. Regrettably, it shows the ignorance that Christians who are opposed to evolution blatantly display. The religious have a great deal of difficulty contending with reality because their belief system has stymied their ability to reason. This is displayed quite effectively when Darwin's daughter dies and his biographers' tell of his distress and depression. Compare that to the poor child who is paralyzed and on a ventilator and her religious parents feel it is God's will and that there must be some latent message the bearded man in the sky is trying to send. Pure insanity. It shouldn't be Darwin who is questioned, it should be the belief in imaginary beings that guide people's lives. And, by the way, genomic sequencing has substantiated evolution, so there is no longer any doubt. The ""theory"" is 100% valid! This is one great documentary.",1445126400,,1087,5.011049723756906
6497588,4,B00LOVBXAA,"I do not find God and evolution theory to be mutually exclusive. Even if the big bang theory is accurate, there is no evidence that precludes God from having designed the universe to unfold in that manner.",1425686400,4,205,4.5675675675675675

The makers of the DVD are to be commended for giving the opposition opportunity to express their disagreement with evolution.  I was especially touched by the testimonies of changed lives because it resonated with me and how God changed my life about 30 years ago.

There is, however, a decided slant in the presentation and we see this from the beginning.  On the one hand we have pastors and other religious workers expressing their opinions regarding evolution and the Bible and on the other hand we have university academics defending Darwin.  It's presented as simply religion vs science.  Of course Darwinist's do not believe that there is any legitimate science backing creationism or supporting the Bible.  Creation scientists from the Institute for Creation Research are not interviewed regarding the science and neither are the scientists with the Creation Research Society.  Had they been included the viewer would have been presented with much more to think about.

I have been teaching science in Christian schools and public schools for nearly 30 years and have found it valuable to draw on the work of the above-named creationist organizations to which professional scientists belong, who are active in scientific research.  As I have considered the claims of evolutionists and creation scientists I have come to see that there really is no science to support Darwinism.  I would recommend the reader get a copy of the DVD Evolution vs God which is also available on Amazon (It is produced by Ray Comfort).  Four evolutionists are interviewed and each one is unable to present any evidence for evolution.  Neither are the students who have been taught evolution able to present evidence.  They are also interviewed.

I would recommend the DVDs by Dr. Carl Werner who was an evolutionist but who then questioned it.  His DVDs are Living Fossils, Evolution: the Grand Experiment II and Evolution: the Grand Experiment I.  What Werner found is that evolutionists have proceeded on the wrong assumptions,  their ""science"" has been deceptive, and they are engaged in far more speculation than the public realizes.  These are presentations well worth getting.

Questioning Darwin does mischaracterize Christians.  For example, at the beginning it says that Christians have called Darwin the anti-Christ and then we see Darwin's profile changed into an ape as if their was hatred for Darwin by Christians.  It definitely makes Christians look bad.  I have been, as I say, a Christian for 34 years and I have never heard Darwin characterized as the anti-Christ.  This characterization does not do justice to the many Christians who have no animosity at all toward Darwin or evolutionists, though they disagree with him.

Later in the movie the a Darwinian expert claims that creationists lie to their children.  This is not true.  They teach their children the Biblical account of creation which the speaker does not agree with.  But they have the freedom to disagree; they have the freedom to believe God rather than man's opinion.

The movie tells us that after the Russians launched Sputnik,  Darwinists claimed that physics and evolution should be taught in the schools if they were to make the school children scientifically literate.  But whereas physics and chemistry have been immensely important in our space program and in other scientific enterprises, evolution has not contributed anything.  But the evolutionists managed to get their dogma into the schools.  And they excluded any scientific presentations that support the Bible.

Evolution dogma is not supported by science, whatever.  Dr.  Professor Maciej Giertych of the Polish Academy has along with many others said that evolution is a philosophy, not a science.  This is the conclusion I have come to after being a teacher 34 years.  There is no science to support evolution, as incredible as that seems.",1425168000,7,4043,5.358730158730158
6497590,1,B00LOVBXAA,"So there are many things going on here--none of them helpful or advancing genuine understanding.  To try to simplify it--
=there are two sides to evolution.  The first is the obvious and undisputed evolution within species.  The second is a religiously fervent and highly questionable point of view that undirected evolution is THE answer to all questions of creation and science.  .
=There are also two sides of the dissent to the religion of undirected evolution.  The first is the very well substantiated, very compelling Intelligent Design.  ID (though the target of undirected evolution zealots) is deeply rooted in science and honest dialogue.  The second is the religiously fervent and highly questionable (in the realms of science) Creationism.

This documentary deceptively hops back and forth to the most convenient side of any of the four options mentioned above to seemingly prove their agenda--that Darwin is a Jesus-like good man that founded the only rational view that undirected evolution is the one true god and anyone who says otherwise is a little crazy or stupid.

It left me frustrated.  If you know nothing and just blindly want to cheer on undirected evolution--this is the documentary for you.  If you are sincerely seeking truth and understanding--don't waste your time on this.",1414281600,3,1304,5.1913875598086126

After all, gravity is only a theory, meaning we all could go flying off into space at any moment. Sure, this documentary purports to be an objective view of anti-science creationists but, really, it is just another in a long line of pro-gravity propaganda. Even Conservapedia admits gravity is just a theory yet you will find its staff walking around without a care in the world. Until Creationists come to terms with their blind following of pro-gravity dogma, I'm afraid they will never be taken seriously by those outside their little group of sheeple.",1409443200,8,730,4.848

8667472,4,B00LOVBXAA,"This was an interesting documentary, and I like to look out for people who have a similar view to my own, but I never find them.  As someone who's not religious, I still find I don't agree with anyone.

I'm a mathematician, and evolution just doesn't make sense to me strictly from a mathematical perspective. I understand how the idea might be appealing to those who haven't given much thought to the probabilities, but the math doesn't work--not in a universe that's only 13.8 billion years old. Moreover, even if the universe was much older, I don't believe you'll get complex systems to form in linear time due to random events. I wish I could rigorously prove that, but it's probably better that I can't.

People so desperately want an answer--any answer--that removing a wrong one is likely to just invite one that's even more off-base. I'm content with an ""I don't know how it happened."" I wish other people were as well.",1525305600,,928,4.680981595092025
8667473,1,B00LOVBXAA,"Again Darwin is so misunderstood veiled in human enthnocentric perspective. Im not saying Im imperical in my thinking, I am a flawed human, but I am an anthropologist with a degree to back it up. Darwin is my heres and in addition to my eduction Ive been to all around the world vis the military so I like to think my views are just a little wider than the average bear. Now having stated that I want to bring this review back to Darwin and what people don't know understandably because my degree has required me an education on Darwin that is not normally taught in school
1. Darwin had a partner a monk named Wallace whom had stronger views of evolutionary adaptations being the mechanism that has resulted in humans today
2. Darwin did not immediately publish his and monk Wallaces work because
  A. His social position inherited by the marriage to his wife, his wife and her family not only had money but social influence and her family put up a fight pressuring Darwin not to publish they were afraid of what the neighbors would think, hummm even way back then and today reputation takes priority over knowledge
3. Monk Wallace got tired of waiting on Darwin to publish and told him I am a monk I have no wife or money or reputation to loose so if you do not publish Ibwill
4. The rest is history
As far as the religious zealots are concerned, well I gave the army 11 years defending their rights to be idiots, so there I will not go
The argument this doc sets up is confusing, what is the point, Christians worshipping scientists asserting to what end, I defended everyones right to believe what they want so am I being ministered 2norcbeing told these zealots are idiots
LASTLY I JUST WISH PEOPLE WOULD GET THE DARWIN/WALLACE STORY RIGHT WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE",1524700800,,1769,4.507788161993769
8667474,5,B00LOVBXAA,"Excellent documentary! Scary, very scary. Why? It's harrowing to watch religion brainwashing the masses and parents brainwashing their kids.",1512172800,,140,6.421052631578948
8667475,4,B00LOVBXAA,"Questioning Darwin takes us into the world of young earth creationism and its rejection of Darwinian evolution.  This group is not presented entirely unsympathetically, but I think the intended takeaway is that their resistance is based on a myopic commitment to Biblical fundamentalism and is actually unreasonable, because, we are told, educated clergy at the time of Darwin had no problem adopting his views.

  But a contrast emerges that may not be immediately evident on the surface, a contrast which these sympathetic religious contemporaries may not have been aware of, and one which shows that it is more than a science versus religion conflict.  Very simply, the issue centers on design.

  The film depicts how Darwin himself was deeply influenced by religious ideas.  It was a religious, not a scientific, conclusion that the suffering and cruelty that he witnessed in the world was inconsistent with the reality of a Creator God who designed individual living things for a purpose.  In his mind he removed God further and further away from any involvement in the natural world, and in so doing, created the intellectual soil and plausibility framework into which his emerging ideas on the history of life could take root and find structure.

  With this in mind, it seems a bit disingenuous of Darwin, as we see at the beginning and at the end of the film, to protest that he has never attacked the church and that he is not an atheist.  His contemporary, theologian Charles Hodge, recognized before many did that though Darwin himself did not deny Gods existence, his theory moved God so far into the background that he may as well not have existed, and therefore it was accurate to call his theory, if not his person, atheistic.

  It becomes clear in the film, then, that for the creationists to be able to find common ground with Darwin requires not merely that they relinquish their insistence on a young earth, but that they evacuate from their Christianity anything resembling a meaningful theism.

  The contrast between Darwin and the creationists is visible in the film, but it could have been much more evident had the filmmakers selected for their representatives of those who question Darwin, those who at the same time are not committed to a young earth, because this insistence is, to say the least, a distraction from the central issue.

  In fact in the film we see what happens: the harshest criticism that the Darwinian representatives level against the creationists is that they are lying to children about the age of the earth.  As interesting as it would be to probe that question, it really is a red herring.

  We also see that the young earth issue is treated as if it were an integral part of what it means to be a creationist, as that unqualified term is applied to this specific group.  But this is too simplistic: the young earth position is a species of the genus of creationism, not the genus itself.  Many who question Darwin are not committed to the young earth position, and many do not even factor the Bible in at all, but challenge Darwin strictly on evidential grounds and would protest being labelled creationists at all.

  What they have in common is a recognition that the primary issue, at least regarding Darwins own view of his theory, is whether or not nature is designed, and whether we, ultimately, exist for a purpose or whether we are merely the product of an unguided process that did not have us in mind.",1506816000,,3468,4.805743243243243
8667476,4,B00LOVBXAA,"Interesting insights into the way creationists think. Though logically deeply flawed, the creationist position makes a lot of sense from a human nature/psychology perspective. People like to feel special. They also like to fight for a righteous cause against adversity. It is beneficial to everyone for us to try and understand how both sides think. We need to always ask, ""Why would otherwise (At least somewhat) intelligent, sincere people think this way?""",1501200000,,458,5.375

But interspersing views of professors and scientists with those of Christian zealots, including nondescript Joe, Mary, John, is cognitively jarring if not outright bizarre. There were some Christian voices which gave the semblance of rationality and authority, and I can see the intention of the producer trying to present views from both sides. However, at the end I was left utterly confused. There was no dialogue or even hope for it. Was it intentional? Was the producer trying to present the Creationists as if they were just like the scientists who were aware of the others' arguments but could not accept them because of their ideology? Or were the Christians portrayed as fanatics who would keep propagating and teaching children lies at all cost despite all their beliefs were refuted by those learned scholars interviewed? Despite the confusion, it deserves a three-star as it is eye-opening to see how irrational believers tried to rationalize their beliefs.",1485043200,2,1030,5.248484848484848
