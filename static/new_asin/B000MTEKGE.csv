2747372,5,B000MTEKGE,There is a mistake in the amazon's film information. The language is italian with english subtitles,1183507200,27,99,5.25
2747373,5,B000MTEKGE,"Of coarse I have heard of St. Anthony, but I really didn't know who he was.  I am VERY picky with what movies I watch.  I will go to other sites and read reviews, and even check to see if EWTN sells it.  While browsing movies for saints on Amazon, I took the risk and purchased it.  First of all I didn't know it was subtitled, I guess I missed that in the summary.  So be ready to read!  But to get to the point... I am SO glad I got this movie.  I highly recommend it.  It is very inspiring and St. Anthony has been added to my list of favorite saints.  Also good writing and good acting.",1181260800,19,590,3.8907563025210083
2747374,5,B000MTEKGE,"Finally, a dramatic feature film on the life of St. Anthony, one of the most popular saints in Christian history. And this film beautifully captures the spirit and life of St. Anthony. One of a series of outstanding recent feature films on saints lives produced in Italy (see SAINT RITA, ST. JOHN BOSCO, PADRE PIO:MIRACLE MAN, SAINT FRANCIS), this is wonderful from start to finish. Daniele Liotti is excellent as Anthony, presenting a captivating performance of Anthony as a somewhat complex man who was born into a privileged life, was very talented, and left it all to serve Christ and his fellow man as a Franciscan priest. Liotti convincingly portrays Anthony as a man who struggled with the decision to  sacrifice everything for Christ, as well as with the challenges he faced as a priest, including dark nights of the soul, persecution and death threats, and staying humble in the face of his great spiritual gifts from God, including miraculous healings, countless conversions and powerful preaching. The film also has glorious cinematography, and a lovely music score. Highly recommended. Not to be missed!",1177113600,79,1115,5.092896174863388

2747413,1,B000MTEKGE,"This movie has little to do with the life of St. Anthony of Padua other than the name.  I am trying to think if they got anything correct about his life but I don't think so, maybe that he is associated with Padua??  Don't waste your time with this one.  I was so angry at the lies about this great Saint's life that I threw it out and complained to Ignatius Press books where I had purchased it.  One thing I can't abide in movies about real life Saints is film-makers not sticking to the truth of their lives.  Another reviewer, ably detailed the lies in this movie.  Maybe the worst, IMO, is that he joined religious life because he almost killed a friend over a woman.  Pathetic!!!!  So many, many things that are wonderful and true about this Saint with many miracles during his life and after his death that the film maker choosing to spend so much energy on portraying false information boggles the mind.  Why not just tell the truth???

They have sat for the length of the movie and ask the best questions.  They totally understand so much.  How can we teach/cultivate virtue? Well, through well made movies like this one.
Excellent actors, story, settings.

2747418,4,B000MTEKGE,"Although Saint Anthony was a priest for less than 12 years and he died in his 30s, his ministry of love and compassion to a basic relationship with God has touched millions.  This a wonderful testament to his life of service and devotion.  I enjoyed the production and acting.  One can feel the reverence for the saint.

All were portrayed to the best of their knowledge and all the actors and actresses were perfect in the role that they played.  What more can I say?  I have to write about every one I bought?  I just wanted to lump them all together to let others know that you cannot go wrong buying from that company who produces such high quality portrates of the charactors that are being brought to life.  Hope this helped anyone out there.",1344816000,2,570,4.4326923076923075
2747429,2,B000MTEKGE,"I was so excited to receive this film the other day. Yet, I must honestly admit, I was a bit disappointed after viewing it. I have read a great deal about St. Anthony. I think this film failed to protray him adequately. There was so much more to this saint than was revealed in this film. He had a great devotion to the Incarnation, the sweet Infant; none of this was brought out in the film. Furthermore, this film failed to emphasize the many miracles that were attributed to St. Anthony's intercessions. I also think this film, for the purpose of embellishment, falsely portrayed him as being weak...a sniffling, whinning and discontent priest. This was not St. Anthony! He was an ardent lover of Christ and the teachings of the Catholic Church and her doctrines. He embraced poverty and relished the opportunity to suffer for souls. As I reflect upon this film, I guess I can say a was more than a little disappointed. I continue to await the release of a film that accurately portrays this beautiful saint as he deserves.",1338940800,5,1026,4.642857142857143
2747430,5,B000MTEKGE,This film delivers an honest look at the religious life during Saint Anthony's life. It also portrays the real struggles of any man. The film definitely has a slight social justice spin but it is not an over-the-top liberation theology king of spin. Acting is amazing. Best I have seen in a saint film.,1332288000,,302,4.611111111111111
2747431,5,B000MTEKGE,"I love this film. So moving and inspirational. It left me the desire to be closer to God through St. Anthony, and to imitate the virtues he practised. Highly recommend it. I didn't mind following the film with English subtitles, in fact I enjoyed the Italian language. I'm keeping it to watch it again to boost fervour towards God and this saint. One thing: If you are ordering this film from the UK, you will get a hefty tax added when you collect it, so it's worth checking how much each provider charges for the tax BEFORE delivery.",1307577600,,535,4.469387755102041
2747432,2,B000MTEKGE,"I have written two books on St. Anthony of Padua (Anthony: Words of Fire, Life of Light, published by Pauline Books and Media and Praying with Anthony of Padua, published by the Word Among Us). Anthony: Words of Fire, Life of Light is a biography of St. Anthony as told through the eyes of those who knew him. Anthony, as a saint, truly converted me while I was writing this book. So I was very anxious to see this movie on St. Anthony because he is such a powerful saint with such a dramatic life. And I was so terribly disappointed in the film because the Anthony it portrays is not the Anthony of history. The one redeeming aspect of the movie, that I felt was done very well, was Anthony's compassion and intercession for the debtors of Padua. But the rest of the movie was disappointing to me. Here are just some of the things that the movie portrayed that are not in any of the histories:

1. That Anthony killed a man in knightly combat.
2. That Anthony had a girl friend by any name (she is called Teresa in the movie)
3. That Anthony was depressed

Here are some wonderful, true incidents in the life of St. Anthony that were not in the movie but, in my opinion, should have been:

1. The power of his preaching. The preaching he is shown giving is sappy, in my opinion, when we actually have volumes of his stirring sermon notes and lofty and beautiful theology. I could have preached better than he did in the movie.
2. The confrontation with heretics (he was called the Hammer of Heretics) yet his love for them. We have hints of this in the movie but don't get a good sense of why he had enemies (the religious and political controversy involving Catharism is not explained well enough).
3. His miracles such as the poor woman's broken wine glass restored or the maid that ran through the rain with vegetables for the friars and didn't get wet or the band of robbers that went to hear him and were all converted.

A great deal of the movie concerned fiction that is not in any of the biographies of the saint while leaving out some of the major and powerful aspects of his life. The movie is worth seeing, but it falls short of the saint. I hope someone remakes a movie of St. Anthony and sticks close to his life as we have it historically because such a movie would be stirring indeed.",1296950400,119,2300,4.341860465116279
2747433,5,B000MTEKGE,"We loved this movie.

The Italian language adds to the beauty.
Pretty good translation via subtitles.
I read them for my younger kids ( 4 + 2 yrs old).  Yes, they have sat through it (not forced!!! ) voluntarily several times.  My oldest - 9 year old - loves it.  She demanded we buy it after borrowing it from a library.

She has just fallen in love with St Anthony! + St. Franic...

It is tough to convey virtue to our kids so what best way, then through the example of saints.

These modern Italian produced movies are so well done.
Truly inspiring!",1280016000,7,552,4.300970873786408
2747434,5,B000MTEKGE,"Through time I have heard about the life of Saint Anthony of Padua, and how you pray for his assistance in different matters, from finding lost abjects to finding true love.

2747446,2,B000MTEKGE,St. Anthony of Padua is my favorite saint so I was hoping to enjoy the story of his life. I was sadly disappointed. A the few books I have read on his life the beginning of this movie does not relate to the books. The people in the movie are speaking Italian so you have to read the English translation that scroll across the bottom of the whole movie very quickly. I believe they got some parts of the movie wrong for instance a young monk calls Antonio a nightingale but actually it was St. Francis who was the nightingale. St. Francis in the movie is called Francesco. The movie was very short and Antonio seemed to be angry the whole time that he could not be a martyr. They showed very little of his preaching and little of his miracles. They never showed that the Christ Child appeared to him. They left out so much of his story. The dvd is not worth buying. Buy a book about it him to get the full scope of the wonderful saint.,1254960000,10,934,4.194444444444445
2747447,4,B000MTEKGE,"I agree with most of the reviewers that this is a beautifully filmed and acted film that both inspires the viewer and captures important aspects of this great saint's life.  My one quibble with it is that it falsifies the instruction of St. Francis to Anthony.  He was told to teach so long as it did not ""quench the spirit of prayer and devotion"" -- not to fight injustice, etc. etc. as the movie portrays it.  While those are fine sentiments, they aren't what Francis said.  As a result, they risk turning Anthony into a modern social reformer, not a saint and miracle-worker.  Also, the movie does have a bit of conventional romantic struggle and drama which is a bit hackneyed, though it too captures something important about who Anthony was.

That said, the movie was generally very careful to capture the deeply religious side of Anthony and I recommend it highly, especially if the viewer does some further reading to deepen their appreciation of and devotion to this giant among saints.  I wish there were a lot more movies of this caliber coming out about religious figures.",1248307200,16,1084,4.73404255319149
2747448,5,B000MTEKGE,"I ordered this film because I had enjoyed the film about Saint John Bosco so much.  I've now watched Saint Anthony a dozen times because I find the struggles of this saint so compelling. It is fascinating how different these two saints were.  St. John Bosco, in the film, seems to know himself so well and he approaches everything with a joy I loved and envy; but the Saint Anthony of this film struggles to reconcile himself with what God wants of him.  He seems rather easier to identify with.  Saint Anthony of Padua was known for his wonderful preaching, and that is beautifully conveyed in this film.  His sermons are both powerful and deeply touching.  I am very impressed with the lead actor, Daniele Liotti, and I thank him for making this saint come alive in such an inspiring film. Glorious cinematography.  Highly recommended.",1243123200,6,837,4.731034482758621

2747450,4,B000MTEKGE,"This movie is entertaining as well as inspiring. It shows that St. Anthony's humanity drew him toward holiness. He wasn't shown as a plastic Saint, but someone who had doubts, pride, questions and a struggle like everyone else.",1219795200,3,227,5.0

Here is a profound,  meaningful, and consistently  moving film about one of the world's greatest saints.  The casting of Daniele Liotti was genius, as the man is unforgettably powerful both before and after his commitment to Christ.  He is quite simply a gorgeous actor, but the beauty is unquestionably spiritual as well as physical. I found the entire film engaging, and the end particularly touching.  These Italian films ( see the one on St. Francis)coming to us through Ignatius Press  are fabulous.  Reading the subtitles is simple, and the soft, gentle voices of the actors are rich and musical as they underscore the written words.  Highly recommended.  And buy it as a gift for those devoted to this great saint, or those who know nothing about him.  They'll all love it.",1195344000,49,865,4.8561643835616435
