8345413,5,B001V1PLL0,"I have skied with Rick a few times and always benefit from his pointers, patience, and obvious expert knowledge of skiing.  I now have the first three DVDs of the Building Blocks series, and I am extremely impressed!  The photography is excellent, as you can see very clearly what Rick is demonstrating and what you need to do to begin to tackle that particular drill.  His verbal explanations are clear, logical, and encouraging, and the additional cues that appear on screen are helpful in emphasizing certain points.

I have begun the work on some of the balance-related drills and some of the edging drills too.  It's a lot to work on, so I try to concentrate on one or two things, and already my skiing is beginning to improve.  So is my confidence!

I wish I had these DVDs about seven years ago when I first started to ski because I am certain I would be a much better skier.  I highly recommend these products to anyone who is serious about improving their skiing technique.",1238716800,,982,4.571428571428571
8345414,5,B001V1PLL0,"I first discovered the Building Blocks Instructional Series from my reading of the Epicski Website, where Rick Schnellmann has been graciously offering people the benefit of his vast coaching experience free of charge for many years.  Over the years I've always respected Rick's knowledge and ability to convey the complicated in simple terms, so I was thrilled when I read he had decided to produce an Instuctional DVD series, and was one of the first to get it.

I can tell you that my high expectations for Rick's program have been exceeded.  The Building Blocks training program is amazing.  The lesson plans are so detailed and complete, and the quality of the video and the demos just blew me away.  It's so easy to see the precise movements each drill is trying to teach, how to do them, and also the potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.  Each drill builds upon the prior, and gradually leads you through an easy to learn progression.

My skiing has almost magically improved.  I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do a self-training program with just video as my coach.  I've tried other such programs and was not very successful, but Building Blocks was different.  I've been working on the Building Blocks training program all season, and I'm learning so many things I didn't even realize I needed to.  I'm feeling so much more comfortable on terrain I found very intimidating before, and my skiing now feels so smooth and flowing, I'm having more fun on skis than I ever have before.

I've just begun to work on the lessons in this DVD.  It teaches you how to carve a turn.  I've read about carving quite a bit, and really thought I was doing it.  After watching and working on the drills in this DVD I now understand that I wasn't close to doing it right.  In this DVD Rick shows you every thing there is to know about carving.  How it's done and how it works, and all the ins and outs of the shape ski.  What an education I've gotten so far from watching this DVD.  Oh carving, when you finally get it, it feels so good!  Thanks to this DVD I finally got to experience what all the fuss over carving is about.  Thanks Rick!",1236816000,,2136,4.481865284974093

This is the Advanced Balance Edition.  It's the 3rd DVD of the Series.  The drills in this DVD are high level, I'm still working on them.  I think most skiers will want to begin with the Building Blocks Basic Balance and Basic Edging editions first.  Those two prepared me to tackle this one.",1236816000,2,1788,4.664536741214057
