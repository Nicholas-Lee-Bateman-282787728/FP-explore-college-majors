4933334,5,B0062P332Y,"I loved this film so much!!!!!! The Killer Elite kicks ass from the opening and never lets up till the ending! I wasn't even a huge Statham fan before I saw Killer but I am now. I watched it because De Niro and Clive Owens are two of my favorite actors - and totally deliver in the movie!

The script is smart and original (and really funny at points - there's one amazing diss by Statham that still cracks me up) and the action scenes were directed perfectly! I kept saying how did they do that?!?!? It's definitely the kind of film to own and watch on Blu-ray over and over.

The only negative thing I can think of is I wasn't a huge fan of the Scorpion's song in the trailer, but that's about all. And who cares about the trailer. Get this movie on Blu-Ray and you'll love it.",1326240000,2,779,4.152317880794702
4933335,5,B0062P332Y,"Full of action with a great cast.  This movie has a good, interesting story to it and what I liked the most is that the action is spilled throughout the movie. If you love great action movies, this is one you don't wanna miss out on!",1326067200,,233,4.065217391304348
4933336,3,B0062P332Y,"""If you don't do this job Hunter's a dead man."" After a job changes the way he feels Danny (Statham) retires from killing. A few years later he hears that his old partner Hunter (DeNiro) has been captured and he is the only one who can go in and rescue him. Nothing is ever as easy as it seems. This movie is based on a true story (if it comes out as 100% true someone is in trouble) of a British SAS mission. Going in I have to admit one of the reasons I watched it was because of Statham. I know what you are thinking, ""but all his movies are the same"". I agree with you but I still watch everything he is in. This one is really no different, but it does have better actors with him. This is a movie with so much potential but ultimately was very up and down. Some scenes were very exciting and fun to watch, while others were flat and boring. Not a lot of consistency made the movie a little disappointing, but the ending was great and made up for the down times. I did enjoy this but glad I didn't pay full price in a theater. Overall, a enjoyable movie that could have used a more consistent feel. Worth watching though. One last note...again what is going on with DeNiro. Does he care anymore? Performance seemed very phoned in. I give it a B.",1324598400,4,1249,4.122950819672131

4933338,3,B0062P332Y,"Within two weeks of September 2011 we had as many remakes of Peckinpah's weakest era of movies - ""Straw Dogs"" and then ""Killer Elite"". At least this pretty much just takes the title and runs with it. It mixes in a bit of history from the late 70's and early 80's  (this movie takes place in 1980)  involving ""The Feather Men"" an organization within the British government that, using their ""light touch"" on geopolitics, were involved in the killing of a shiek's sons in Oman. In this version Jason Statham is a mercenary hired by a dying shiek to kill the British SAS guys who killed his sons. This way the family honor will be returned and his one living son can take his place in the hierarchy and the British government will ultimately reap the political and economic rewards for helping to bring all this about. He accomplishes these tasks but now, Clive Owen, playing the SAS guy employed by ""Feather Men"", wants to get back at Statham's character for killing three of his SAS guys. The movie's a pretty good mix of more believable ""spy stuff"" and action that's still pretty hyper-stylized. I kept thinking about movies like ""The Wild Geese"" and ""Dogs of War"" which came out about the same time this movie takes place and it struck me how this IS kind of like those movies but with the hand-held camera ""this is happening right now"" Jason Bourne type action, from this current era. All in all I don't come away with an overall strong impression of what makes this movie stand out from the other action movies this year. ""Hanna"" was sort of an ""art action movie"" and ""Colombiana"" was a slicked-up, modern grindhouse movie. This has some great sequences like Statham fighting off two guys while cuffed to a chair, but this mix of Bourne era movie action and post-Watergate/pre Iran Contra conspiracy stuff ultimately just all blurs together. The parts are greater than the whole. Still though as remakes of 70's Peckinpah go, this one could be seen, as the more elite compared to it's original, but then even that wasn't quite at the top its form.",1323475200,26,2050,4.6291208791208796
4933339,1,B0062P332Y,"the best thing about this film was the use of ""rock you like a hurricane' in the trailer.
seriously...a waste of my time AND a waste of very talented actors.

the script was all of the place and the ""characters' were just shadows of what
they could have been.

i really hate that i went to see this in the theatre.

4933340,2,B0062P332Y,"Based very loosely on the rather interesting 1991 book ""The Feather Men"" by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, ""The Killer Elite"" shows Hollywood cowardice at its best: successfully emasculating, with formulaic, politically correct stereotypes, what should have been a very good film.

While normally enjoying Jason Statham in the various characters he has played on the big screen, watching his character (Danny) and his group of thuggish assassins murder British Special Air Service (SAS) veterans was extremely difficult. And why, you may ask, do Danny and his team kill these SAS veterans? According to the film: in order to save an absurdly cast Robert De Niro. After watching De Niro for about a minute, I would have just left him in the prison and gone out and had a pint with the SAS veterans (and Clive Owen, who was great in this film).

Some of the scenes in this film are very good. And, some of the action sequences, taken in a vacuum, are also very good. However, action and scenery do not make a good film, and ""The Killer Elite"" is, sadly, another example of the principle.

The screenwriters not sticking to the original story from Sir Ranaulph's novel was the death blow to ""The Killer Elite."" So, if you are in the mood for yet another Hollywood, watered-down, politically correct, ""action"" film, this one is for you. If not, I would still recommend reading the book and then renting this film just to see how bad Hollywood was to the original story.

I just found the hunting down of the three SAS guys really intriguing but the actual carrying out of the hits were pretty perfunctory bar the car chase one. I also thought Robert DeNiro was vastly underused in this. Love Jason Statham and Clive Owen, but needed DeNiro onscreen a bit more than he was. Good to see Yvonne Strahovski (from ""Chuck""!) still alive and well. You won't recognize Dominic Purcell (""Prison Break"") as he goes full muttonchop '80s and total Joe Namath horndog in a fantastic role as the second wheel in Statham's crew.

Anyway, the movie I'd give three stars but I'm giving the DVD an extra star for the almost 45 minutes of interviews on the movie with the actors, director and crew.

That said, De Niro doesn't have a big part in this movie.  It's mostly Statham, with Clive Owen as the nemesis.  But it is a pretty good ride.  The script could be stronger, and so could the directing and perhaps editing.

What can I say?  Statham should be Bond, and his talents put to full use.  His material is seldom as good as he is.  If you really want to enjoy him, rent or buy Transporter 1, 2, or 3.",1454457600,,683,4.217054263565892

But even with the high-powered leads and colorful locales, Killer Elite can't be saved from the ranks of the also-rans. The incomprehensible story line aside, KE plain leaves a bad taste in the mouth, and it's not due just to the general mean-spiritedness and excessive violence - this is a story about professional killers, after all, fighting among themselves mostly. It's also the racist, stereotypical portrayals of Arabs and Mexicans, and the clichd depiction of Australia - where our (anti)hero wants to start anew - as a bucolic paradise.
KE does have a certain high adrenaline entertainment value, and you could do worse for a time-passing action thriller on a rainy evening.

4933518,4,B0062P332Y,"Killer Elite
 Killer Elite stands at the summit of action flicks.  I think it is the best action flick in years.  It stands in the same company to the excellent Ronan of a few years ago, which not entirely coincidentally also features Robert De Niro.  The producers trusted new director Gary McKendry with this project rather than some well known and experienced action director.  In terms of the art, the gamble pays off big time.  McKendry also is credited with the script along with Matt Shering.  Shering is also a novice script writer, he and McKendry have not had a script accepted for the big screen prior to Killer Elite.  Maybe it is because they have no Hollywood bad habits to break which gives the script such zing and pizzazz.  Or perhaps the original work, The Feathermen by Ranalph Fiennes was of such exceptional quality that no one could mess it up.  Scratch that.  Hollywood has messed up very fine original works in the past, goodness knows.  In any case, the script is twisty enough to keep us on our seat edge throughout the film.  Yippee!
 De Niro has only a supportive role.  He spends most of the film as a captive to a lawless sheik in Oman in the early 1980s. The Oman civil war has ended; the wealthy sheik has come out on the losing side and wants revenge for his three dead sons.  De Niro, as Hunter, is the leverage that the sheik uses against Jason Statham (as Danny Bryce.)  Bryce must commit three revenge murders in order to free his friend (and get six million bloody dollars.)
 We then find out that the three victims to be are all former British Special Air Service soldiers who, quite separately while helping the Omani government overcome the rebellion, blatantly murdered the three sons of the sheik.  With me so far?  Clive Owen is the protector of the SAS veterans.  He is controlled by a squad of elderly SAS vets, now successful businessmen, who look out for the lads.  They are the feathermen of the book title.  They do not take kindly to having their brethren whacked by Stratham.
 This adds up to some great fight scenes between Clive Owen, a protector of murders, and Jason Statham, a murderer sent to punish killers.  There is the obligatory car chase, which is done with verve and style but never goes over the top.  The various shootings and beating are never pro forma; they are all intense, realistic and necessary.  It is amazing that a first time director managed to get this complicated business just right.
 Also featured is Yvonne Strahovski, famously of the TV series Chuck who plays a pretty girl and gets that part just right.
 This thrilling four saw blade actioner delivers the goods better than any recent film of this type (including Clive Owens Shootum up which is all action and no character). Statham and De Niro gain our sympathy because, stinky as they are from a life of violence, they are trying to get shed of it. Even with limited screen time, De Niro is an actor of such power that he dominates the film artistically.  It is R rated for plenty of extreme violence and runs a solid 100 minutes.  The producers might wish that they had spent less than the reported $70 million to film this action delight.  It has taken in only a tiny $9.5 million to date.",1411689600,,3230,4.563478260869565

There are a load of liberties taken, especially when it comes to firearms used verses what was actually available for the period.

The issue I have is with Amazon - they are listing this item as Killer Elite (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet). Well, it isn't - it's Killer Elite (Blu-ray + DVD). I only purchased this through the US Amazon store because I also wanted the digital copy. Instead, I paid more for shipping and only got what I could've have purchased through the Canadian store and saved on shipping. In fact, the item was shipped from within Canada anyway, so Amazon made no effort to ship the item I actually thought I was purchasing.

4933549,4,B0062P332Y,"Every Jason Statham movie is better than the last, as he continues to cement his reputation as the action star of Generation X. Since it's domination of the late 80s, Action movies have really suffered due to a lack of decent story lines and an infestation of stars, who landed these roles, simply due to their size, but Statham is changing all that, as evident by his latest film, Killer Elite. Based on the novel, The Feather Men by Ranulph Fiennes, Killer Elite covers the events, following a British covert op in the early 80s. The British Navy Seals (The S.A.S.) secretly forced out oil rich land owners in the Middle East, by whatever means necessary, in order to steal their land. Five years later, on his death bed, one sheik is seeking revenge for the death of 3 of his sons. To do this, the sheik has hired an elite team of underground hit men to take out the men suspected of killing his children, not an easy task when you consider that all the targets are highly trained former military operatives. Jason Statham stars as Danny Bryce, the team leader who is forced out of retirement, to take on the hardest job of his career. As has become common place, Statham is terrific and really carries the story on his back. Killer Elite is a someone complicated plot, with a first time director, but thanks to Statham's experience, you'll think these guys have been working together for year. As his reputation has continued to grow, bigger and bigger stars want to work with Statham, and any time you can add names like Robert De Niro and Clive Owen to a film, it only enhances it and boosts it's potential audience. Aside from just the amazing action sequences and covert maneuvers, the story adds real life drama to the film, by including shady government cover ups, double agents, and even police involvement in the events, making for the rarest of rare in the Action genre, a film with a deep and compelling plot. That's what really makes this film so good, it's not just about the chases, explosions, and killing, there is a real story here, that is unpredictable and very well written. Killer Elite may not top Parker as Statham's best movie, but it's pretty close. If you enjoy a fast-paced, edge of your seat movie, with a lot of interesting characters and a deep plot, than you won't want to miss this film.",1398556800,,2322,4.584134615384615

4933593,4,B0062P332Y,"Killer Elite(released Sept/11)stars,among others,Jason Statham as Danny Bryce,Clive Owen as Spike Logan,Yvonne Strahovski as Anne Frazier and Robert De Niro as Hunter. This film is certainly a wild ride and it has its characters jumping back and forth between the Arabian desert and London,England on a regular basis. It also has a LOT of PLOT.They say the devil is in the details,and if you can hang on for the ride,in the end it will be worth it.
The story finds Statham as an elite assassin who comes out of retirement in order to rescue his ex partner DeNiro,who is being held by an Arabian Sheik. In exchange for his ex partners freedom,he wants Statham to kill the three ex British SAS soldiers who killed his three sons. Statham agrees and he starts down a long,long path of revenge for the Sheik. Statham gets his contact info from a travel agent,who in turn gets his from a covert government agent.
Statham assembles a small group together to tackle each job. They either work in tandem or separately. But all hits must have proof on film of their confessions and subsequent death. Each hit takes a lot of prep time and one by one they reach their third victim. By that time a group of ex SAS men,led by Owen,has been hot on their trail and Owen has already done one on one battle with Statham. Owen's group is called the Feathermen,and he reports directly to a hush hush group of individuals high up in government circles. As the heat rises the group start gets cold feet and eventually Owen finds himself alone and rogue.
Statham finishes the last man and he reports to the Sheik and it all ends. He heads back home to his girlfriend and De Niro is free and he also heads homeward. All is well until one night Statham receives a call saying the job isn't finished. It seems there's one more to go;a man who is writing a book,which contains the name of the real killer of one of the Sheiks sons. To put the point home the caller tells him to check his girlfriend,if he has any doubts. He goes upstairs to find her quite well,lying in bed,but quickly retrieves an unspent bullet from behind her head,on the pillow. Realizing he has to go this alone,he takes her with him to Paris. He contacts DeNiro who comes back to watch his girlfriend for him,though DeNiro pleas to go along with him.
Statham attends a book signing of the author,who he must off. However it is all a clever trap to get Statham,by Owen. Statham gets his man and evidence and flees,but is eventually caught. Statham agrees to tell Owen exactly what has been happening in exchange for his freedom. But in walks the secretive government man who has been dishing intel to Statham's contact/travel agent. He tells them the government wants the oil rich land the Sheik owns and that they were both set up from the start. A fight ensues with the G-man going down and Statham fleeing.
Next we have Statham and DeNiro back in Arabia,with Statham about to walk in to hand over the evidence. Something is amiss though,as Owen has gone in ahead and handed it over,ahead of Statham's arrival. Not only that but Owen has killed the Sheik and Owen has had to flee for his life. Statham and DeNiro take care of the Sheik's men and they stop Owen. Deniro takes some of the pay money for his own expenses,but Statham refuses any of it. DeNiro leaves the rest for Owen who he says better use it well,because the government man he killed,plus his ex bosses of the Feathermen,will be coming after him. They leave Owen to his own devices and Statham and DeNiro return to their own lives.
The film is based on a true story from the /91 book called Feathermen. The author laid it all out there,but of course the British establishment denied everything from start to finish. My storytelling of this film which lasts a good two hours,is far less than a Reader's Digest version. I make the first three killings within a paragraph and those hits took over an hour of film time. As I said there is a LOT of plot,and so many twists and turns and intrigues,that one could really never do justice to it all. Just trust me,that if you just hang in there,you will be rewarded. The film does have a tendency to drift a little,such as their traveling back and forth between desert and civilization constantly,and who is on the hit list next,can get a little overwhelming. But the makers somehow manage to keep a straight heading throughout.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its 2:40:1 original a/r. There are cast interviews and 13 deleted scenes.
All in all a whopper of a story to tell,but based on true incidents. Statham is on game and as intense as always. DeNiro,while not having a significant role to play is also on target as is other star Clive Owen. Recommended.",1375574400,,4734,4.557511737089202

The plotline seems ridiculously simple until the last 40 minutes or so, when the threads begin to thicken. Good acting by all, and the fact that all the major players here have a strong desire to get out of the assassination game adds to their believability as well as their likeability.

4933604,2,B0062P332Y,"The true elements to this story have been exaggerated to the movie star personality and the type of films JASON STATHAM makes. It's a formula that seems familiar in most Statham action movies. Even though I thought this film could have been better as for a Statham film it's one of his better films alongside THE MECHANIC. The premise to this film is intriging and had my interest to a certain degree. The shoot-outs, car chases and hand-to-hand combat have an air of authenticity. It's a well shot movie. The only problem is it has some smelly acting in the supporting roles. The one bad performance was the Sheik's son who delivers an amateur performance and can't hold his own alongside DeNero and Clive Owen. It's worth a look as the this type of spy/mercenary genre is a favourite. As for me DeNero was showcased better in John Frankenheimer's RONIN, are good companion piece to THE KILLER ELITE.",1363478400,,901,4.708860759493671

4933616,3,B0062P332Y,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

I'm having a hard time figuring out a way to start this. As the title suggests I was expecting something totally different when I watched Killer Elite the other day. It's not that it was bad, I just think I might have gotten this confused with another movie when I picked it up at the video store.

The film wastes no time in throwing you into the action when about five minutes in we reach our first firefight. This segment manages to set up the back story of the film. We have Danny Bryce (Jason Statham) that wishes to get out of the hitman business. Unfortunately that doesn't last long when he finds out that his partner Hunter (Robert De Niro) is being held captive. In order to free his former partner Danny must complete the job that Hunter failed to accomplish. It might have been a good story if it had been a little more coherent, but sadly it felt like it went all over the place.

For me it felt like the director put more focus on the action than he did on constructing a proper plot. So in that regard I guess you can say he accomplished his goal. There's a lot of action sequences in here and almost all of them are pretty intense. However they do start to lose some of their flare once you reach the halfway mark. Plus the camera work on this film is pretty awful at times. You'll occasionally reach a few segments that look more like a blur than an actual scene.

The best thing about this film is its cast, or I should say it's main cast. On the forefront you have Jason Statham, Robert De Niro, and Clive Owen. While Statham is the one who appears most in the film, Clive Owen has some pretty frequent scenes and he makes his presence notable. Overall the acting was well done, I just feel like it would have been more enjoyable to watch had they gotten a better script.

Finally, the sound on this is extremely irritating. All the dialogue sequences sound like a whisper and they almost always cut into a very loud action sequence right after. I was constantly turning the volume up and then lowering it down a few minutes later. I don't know about you, but when I have to do that while watching the film it bugs the living hell out of me. I just want to watch it, I shouldn't have to be fiddling with the remote every five minutes.

Overall Score: 6/10 - I really wanted to enjoy this film, but in the end it was kind of lackluster. Whether it's because I picked up the wrong film I don't know, but even if I picked up the right movie I still think I wouldn't have been too satisfied with what I watched. The only really interesting thing about this movie is that it's supposedly based on a true story. Other than that it's just another action flick that relies too heavily on violence without using it to form some kind of proper story. Oh well.",1359072000,,2819,4.309433962264151

4933625,5,B0062P332Y,"I usually like Jason Statham movies and then add Clive Owen and Robert De Niro to the list and you know the movie is bound to be good, I love action movies. That being said I didn't think i would like this movie as much as I did.
In movies, especially action or 'assassin' movies the killing is pulled off with pyrotechnics and flashy fight sequences and over the top gun battles.
This movie did have it's fair share of car chases and some really impressive fight scenes, but the part that I found stuck with me the most, was just how intimate (for lack of a better word) the killing was. In most movies killing is distanced or in the heat of battle or there is a reason for the killing in the first place some justification for why the person deserves to die. A basic revenge plot line. This movie gave you no such thing, while I rooted for Danny (Jason Satham) I found myself feeling empathy for his targets. They were soldiers, maybe they did some questionable things, but they were following orders and in war I can only assume that things get messy and the lines get blurred very quickly.
I also found it interesting how the character's interacted with one another, and their varying view points, Clive Owen with his taking the death's personally, these were soldiers fellow ex- SAS and the fact that a team of killers was taking out men who had sacrificed for their country was very personal for him.
Danny in some ways had a much colder outlook which matched with who he had been and what he had done in the past, these killings were just a means to and end, the release of his long time friend and mentor and yet at the same time you knew he was struggling with his 'newly' aquired conscience.
Over all this movie was wonderfully done.",1357257600,3,1743,4.3993808049535605

In order to save him, Danny must put together an elite team to help assassinate three ex-SAS agents.

But with other connected parties all throwing their own agendas into the mix, Danny has more than three tough-as-nails SAS soldiers to worry about.

`Killer Elite' is a great, edgy, action-thriller to sit through and delivers a pretty good story with it. Granted, sometimes it relies on coincidences to get characters into a fight and people just `discover' things for our characters to get the plot moving, not to mention, people keep carrying out their plans despite knowing they're being watched, but there's really a lot going on here with the different groups, and characters, all having their own motives for helping or hindering the mission, and so it adds a lot of unexpected twists and tension into the story.

The action is largely enjoyable and it's great to see that they tried to keep it all as grounded as they could, this being based on a supposedly true story, there was nothing really over-the-top; just simple, straight-forward, smack-bang action that kept with the realistic, gritty tone of the film.

The performances were really good and believable, all the characters felt like they belonged in this dark world; Jason Statham channels...well...Jason Statham into Danny. Clive Owen is appropriately menacing and scary as Spike, Danny's counterpart and Robert De Niro pulls off a role that he can probably do sleeping. Dominic Purcell, Aden Young, Ben Mendelsohn and the beautiful Yvonne Strahovski all capably support the main cast.

I only saw the deleted scenes, most I can understand why director Gary McKendry left out, but there were others that, if they had been kept in, would've really helped to explain a few things and fleshed out some of the characters a bit more. It was great to see them included here, though.",1351728000,,2058,4.905172413793103

Unfortunately the man in charge wasn't accepting their resignation--at least not until they did one more job. What they discovered wasn't one last assignment, but a suicide mission. High-risk, high-profile, low success.

There are a lot more people and organizations involved than they originally thought--organizations that aren't supposed to exist.

You could take the action out of this movie and you have a great story.  The action was incredible as Statham usually is and it was interesting how Deniro's character fleshed out in the end of the movie.  There is a lot of story and action crammed into a 2 hour movie with it feeling rushed at all, it felt like a much longer movie.

Statham plays Danny, a retired contract killer in the early 80s that gets drawn back into the game when his mentor and friend (De Niro) gets kidnapped and soon enough Danny finds himself on a reluctant mission, and eventually on the run from another pro (Owen) that's just as driven as he is.  While Killer Elite manages to pack enough nicely orchestrated action set pieces, there isn't anything here you haven't seen before.  Not to mention that were it not for the star power of Statham, Owen, and De Niro; not many would probably pay much attention to it in the first place.

4933655,4,B0062P332Y,"Director Gary McKendry's first deature film ""Killer Elite"" is an old school action flick starring one of the most famous action stars of our generation, Jason Statham. The story (adapted from the book by ""The Feather Men"" by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, which he claims is based on truths) is about a group of mercenaries hunting down the targets, while being chased by a former SAS officer leading a secret society ""The Feathermen."" Largely set in 1980, ""Killer Elite"" looks like a throwback to the 80's style action movies with tough guys with a good heart fighting for what they believe. No high-tech gadgets. No shaky camerawork. Just hardheaded heroes with guns and muscles.

Jason Statham is Danny, a former member of a mercenary team: Danny, Hunter (Robert De Niro), Davies (Dominic Purcell) and Meier (Aden Young). Severely wounded in Mexico and fed up with the life as a mercenary, Danny retires and goes back to Australia. One year later, however, he is called back into action when his mentor Hunter is held captive by a sheik of Oman.

What the sheik wants is revenge for the deaths of his sons, and forces Danny to kill three former SAS agents. With Davies and Meier, Danny sets out for one last mission, but the ""Feathermen"" enforcer Spike (Clive Owen) is quick to respond, trying to protect the targeted SAS members while tracking down Danny.

Yvonne Strahovski appears as Anne, Danny's girlfriend, but ""Killer Elite"" is mostly about these tough guys and their missions. Acting is solid, location is interesting, and action set-pieces (shoot-outs and chases) are very good, though the cat-and mouse story itself is not compelling as it should be.",1337299200,,1653,4.917562724014337

4933664,4,B0062P332Y,"The Killer Elite bears some loose connection to a book by the same name, which itself is billed as non-fiction and may have some connection to fact.  Let's dismiss the film's claim to being based on fact and see whether it is entertaining.  First, who are the killer elite of the title?  It should be Britain's famed SAS, some members of which are to be targeted by a small group of mercenaries hired by an Omani sheikh to get revenge for the deaths of his sons.  It may however be the mercenaries, who are to be seen as among the best in their particular line of work.  They include Jason Statham and, tangentially, Robert DeNiro.  But it may be a small ""committee"" of ex-SAS who include Clive Owen, who collectively are known as the ""Feather Men"".  The violent interplay between the latter two groups and especially between Statham and Owen is the heart of the movie.

There are some outstanding fight scenes, some interesting developments in the plot, and excellent acting.  Here it should be mentioned that there is a love interest between Statham and Yvonne Strahovski (yes, the model and voice of Miranda in Mass Effect 2 and 3!) that works better than such things usually do in movies of this sort.  There is also a buddy thing going on between Statham and DeNiro, despite being of different generations, leading one to ask why DeNiro was picked for the part and why he chose to accept?  All this added to the fine cinematography makes this a movie that rises somewhat above its genre and is definitely entertaining.",1334880000,,1523,4.645522388059701

He decides to retire, a decision that lasts to about a minute after the credits when he gets a message De Niro has been taken hostage.

Now for the initial strange twists:
The sheik who has Hunter held hostage is the same man who hires Danny.
Danny must kill British agents in order to get Hunter freed. These are ""SAS"" agents who are tougher than Navy SEALS, or so they say in the film.
These 3 agents must confess on film to having killed the sheik's son. They are trained to resist torture.
And it must look like an accident.

One last thing...they only have the identity of one of the agents. Once the first agent is killed, the SAS suspects something is up...
A few plot twists, some cliche lines, and the movie is over except this movie got bogged down with twists and bad lines to the point that you can't wait for it to end. Much too long to hold my interest all the way through.

Of course, this is a 2011 film done using modern equipment that makes actual 80's film quality pale significantly by comparison.

As a period piece set in the early 80's this Killer Elite (no relation to the 70's film with the same name) is a winner.  This is a fun film with a good amount of action and even some SAS action.

Who Dares Wins features many actual SAS chaps and featured a great many scenes shot in actual SAS training facilities.  Fun stuff.

To my mind, 2011's Killer Elite and 1982's Who Dares Wins make a great double feature.

4933680,2,B0062P332Y,"This perfunctory action film opens in Mexico with a hit squad comprised of Jason Statham, Robert De Niro and Dominic Purcell taking out some high ranking guy in a limo.  We don't know who he is (politician?, drug lord?) but the scene closes when Danny (Statham) comes face to face with the young son of the guy he just killed.  I guess this is the critical point when Danny decides to retire.

A year later in 1981, Danny has moved to Australia and taken up housekeeping with Anne (Yvonne Strahovski, TV's ""Chuck"").  She's gorgeous of course, but you wouldn't know it here.  She is pretty much wallpaper in a roomy cotton dress most of the time.  Danny must travel to Oman to rescue his friend Hunter (De Niro) who is being held by a sheik.  So here's the deal.  The sheik will release Hunter if Danny will fulfill Hunter's original job.  That is to kill 3 British SAS (Special Forces) officers that were responsible for killing the sheik's 3 sons during the conflicts in the late 1970's.  This is never clear when or why.  Just that they are dead and the Brits did it.

But, these guys can't just be killed.  They must confess first and Danny must provide proof.  Danny gets his old buddy Davies (Purcell, the best thing in this movie) and another guy (Aden Young) to help out.  There's a $6 million reward if they pull it off plus the release of Hunter.  My head starts to hurt trying to figure out who is on which side.  Something about a double top secret SAS squad controlled by some old farts in suits.

Somehow Clive Owen is involved as the main foe of Danny.  But then Spike (yes, that's Owen's character) is all for Queen and country.  Spike is also the only one who has a chance of beating Danny in hand to hand combat.  This movie is a convoluted mess.  Even with a stellar cast this film is just  a time waster.  Statham is as good as it gets in action adventure and Owen is always good.  But De Niro is miscast and is obviously here for a paycheck.  They are not the problem.  Based on true events, the entire concept is just an incoherent bore the way it is written.

The Blu ray disc is sharp and clear.  The DTS-HD Master Audio is solid if not spectacular.  I was expecting a bit more for this type of movie. Special features are spare.  Some deleted scenes and not much else.",1330128000,7,2292,4.347517730496454
4933681,3,B0062P332Y,"I checked this movie out for the cast and thought I could do no wrong cause I'm a big fan of De Niro, Statham and Owen.  My first impression that something was amiss was when the main ""elite killer"" (Statham) turns his back on a wounded armed baddie and decides to look out the window during a stealthy escape.  There are a number of WTF moments like that, and it's sad because I think the movie has some good stuff to show.  It's not a horrible movie but it isn't a great one either.

I mostly enjoyed plot aspects like Statham's group being hired to kill 3 guys while yet another group (Owen's group) notices this and starts to observe Statham's group.  So there are some inter-group dynamics that get pretty interesting by the time the guy in the black helicopter shows up (MFWIC).  Then there is the committee that sort of controls Owen's group except when it doesn't.

My point is there are some complex group dynamics at play.  It takes some effort to keep track of it all, but it is interesting even when it's hard to understand everyone's motive right away.  I also enjoyed the aspect of Statham's work that involved making all his hits look like accidents.  It reminded me of Mission Impossible a bit and I think that could have been expanded on more.  And some of the action was well done with a few original embellishments.

But how can you believe a group like Statham's are elite killers when one of the recruits does some unbelievably dumb stuff?  Or is the title half satire?  Apparently professional killers don't look for qualifications in their hiring.  Unless of course ""I'm schtupping his Mother"" is a reference.

The movie seems fast paced to me not just because of the action but the frequent cuts between different scenes.  So I don't think everyone will have time to dwell on the gaping logical holes in the script.  Some bad dialog however is right in our face and the cliches are plain and painful.  I also wish the film had done more on scene work.  That can greatly help an action movie as it did in ""Empire of the Wolves"".

4933687,4,B0062P332Y,"Although it shares nearly the same title as Sam Peckinpah's film, ""Killer Elite"" beyond the fact that it involves government affiliated assassins has nothing to do with the film. ""The Killer Elite"" (Peckinpah's film) is based on the novel ""Monkey in The Middle"" by Robert Rostand while THIS film is based on a ""nonfiction"" book by Sir Ranulph Fiennes called ""The Feather Men"".

Mercenary assassins Danny Bryce (Jason Statham), Davies (Dominic Purcell), and Meier (Aden Young)must save their colleague Hunter (Robert DeNiro)who is taken prisoner for a failed assassination. If Bryce, Davies and Meier don't complete Hunter's mission (for which he was promised $6 million) to assassinate the killers of the Sheikh Amr's sons, they'll kill him. Complicating Bryce's mission are ""the Feather Men"" a group of former SAS members who protect their own. Their enforcer Spike Logan (Clive Owen) is sent to investigate and prevent the killing of its members.

A well made thriller from first time feature director Gary McKendry, ""Killer Elit"" positively bristles with energy and features something a bit unusual for a thriller of this type--actual character development. It's not enough that the action sequences are well designed, many unique and well shot the fact that McKendry and screenwriter Matt Sherring create a compelling thriller with a solid story and solid performances. There have been some compliants about the various subplots in the film slowing down the action with exposition and I'd disagree. I found it to be a nice combination of the parranoid thrillers from the 1970's and early 80's combined with the more recent action driven ones. I suspect that those complaining about the exposition don't care for those more paranoid spy thrillers from another era.

The one flaw with the film is that it could have been trimmed a bit but that's a minor complaint at best. The characters, acting and action sequences more than make up for a slightly bloated running time. At it's best ""Killer Elite"" reminds me of some of John Frankenheimer's strong later thrillers.

The DVD looks quite nice with a solid presentation. Colors are on the cool side (and reflects the original theatrical presentation of the movie). Audio is extremely active with a nice, immersive 5.1 mix.

Writing, exposition and overall delivery fell short of the amazing lineup on the bill. This film does not deliver and is a colossal waste of time.  I'd have turned it off- but It was like a car wreck I couldn't walk away from.

Robert DeNiro- he's on the cover- but disappears for about and hour and a half during the crux of the story-line.  While Statham is generally compelling to watch, and Owen is convincing- they cannot hold up this bag of hot air.

Seriously- go vacuum your rugs- it would be a better use of your time.",1327449600,3,605,4.271929824561403
4933701,5,B0062P332Y,"After some of the reviews I've seen on this movie, I wasn't expecting much. I can now say I was very suprised. I thought the movie was well written and the acting was excellent. I suspect some of the negative reviews were for one of two reasons....one, you just don't like violence or two, you're brain just can't process a movie that has an evolving storyline. In the first case, maybe you should stick to G movies since the real world does have violence and in the second, well...maybe you should stick to G movies. Simple isn't it?",1327276800,3,534,4.459183673469388
4933702,5,B0062P332Y,"Great movie, very intense and one I did not fall asleep watching.  Some parts were really violent but when your an assassin what would one expect.  What intrigued me even more was that it was actually based on a true story.  The stunts were fantastic.  Those stunt men earn every penny.  It almost seemed impossible anyone could actually live through all the beatings and be at one place just at the right time.  I give it an A+",1327104000,,428,4.423076923076923
4933703,1,B0062P332Y,"This film has a lot of action, but it's difficult to follow at times. At the end, a hired assassin gets to live happily ever after with his girlfriend. What kind of message is this? His buddy who's also a hired assassin also seems to be a family man, but the family is never shown. So, what does this mean? I guess it means that killing people is just another way of making a living, but it's not pleasant. The fact that these ""family men"" should get the electric chair or a lethal injection doesn't come into it. Just like Danny Bryce wants to swear off killing people for a living, after watching this, I want to swear off violent action movies.",1327104000,2,647,4.311475409836065
4933704,2,B0062P332Y,"This action-thriller-spy movie just goes to show, great actors don't necessarily make great movies do--good scripts do. The original had James Caan & Robert Duvall; this remake has Jason Statham & Robert De Niro sounds like it couldn't miss right? Wrong. It's all action and complicated plot points and no soul. All explosions, gunfire, and fights and none of it matters. The original had the assassins/friends turning on each other with Duvall putting Caan out of the business by wounding him severely, but not killing him. The rehab & revenge angle of that film made it worth seeing. Here we have a genuine 'buddy' film but the 2 buddies kill people for money. De Niro is also a 'family man' with a Wife & kids we never see, while Statham has a beautiful girlfriend waiting for him back home who just wants to reform her man from his wicked past thru her undying love. Dumb. Jason Statham is a genuine action star and has made some good movies (The Transporter is one), and De Niro made a similar(but MUCH better) film, ""Ronan"" but both tough guys 'flop' here. And Clive Owen? He's a great actor (watch him in The Croupier)--but he makes a lot of crummy movies like this one and he's too good in his good films to make 'crap' like this. Watch the original--its 10X better.",1327017600,4,1274,4.592105263157895
4933705,5,B0062P332Y,"Based on a true story, it's a really good movie.

Trade-craft of the 80's is so interesting and I'm sorry, but there's been probably tens of thousands of people (since 2001, probably a million since 1963) murdered to look like accidents and heart-attacks. That's why the story is so awesome, the actors of course are good too. A fully-fledged good movie.

Killer Elite reminded me of how many bad movies there have been in the last ten years, how everytime I like a new show (especially sci-fi), it gets cancelled or dumbed down. What's left is all this fodder that's a waste of time. The last movie I think I liked was Jumper.

4933706,1,B0062P332Y,"Robert DeNiro is one of my favorite actors but he was just phoning in his performance in this stinker of a movie.  The writing was sophomoric at best.  The plot? Well there was sort of a plot but it seemed to be more of a thin thread to link a series of action scenes.  The dialogue was one clich after another. The director and writers might want to brush up on their skills at developing the characters and creating a story line that was clear and had a modicum of believability.

I guess DeNiro just needed the money. I am sure he was brought into this project to add more star power.  Sorry, even the $3.99 rental fee was too much for this one.",1326672000,12,648,4.193548387096774
4933707,2,B0062P332Y,"Sometimes a movie will have all the right ingredients but somehow the finished product doesn't add up.  For me. this is what happened with this movie.  I love a good mindless action flick and this one had many good actors. I feel the director played a part in what was lacking.  For one, the character development was poor.  We WANT to like these guys but there wasn't alot to latch onto; Statham was Statham, DeNiro's character was one dimensional (kept waiting for more and it never came), Owen's character had no likability at all, etc, etc..  The one on one fight scenes were SO annoying, worse than the wiggly camera trend.  You could barely see what was going on. It was also hard to keep up with what was going on with the plot, there didn't seem to be alot of emphasis on making sure the viewer understood what was happening.

At the end of this film, all I could think of was what was wrong with it. I won't be giving this director a 2nd chance.",1326585600,2,954,4.3559322033898304
4933708,4,B0062P332Y,"With a cast that includes Jason Statham, Clive Owen and Robert DeNiro you would expect an exceptional film. It is a good film, filled with action.

This film is said to be based on fact and not fiction. It is far fetched in some ways, but with the recent assassination of a scientist in Iran, presumably by the Israelis or the CIA, I find it more believable. Two teams of ex-SAS men are trying to kill each other. Or, at least, Jason Statham, has been asked to kill four ex-SAS men, and to make it look like an accident. He agrees to this mission to save the life of his mentor, played by Robert De Niro. Clive Owen, is from a group of men called the 'Feather Men' who are hired to protect ex-SAS men from retribution. A little convoluted, but all in all simple to follow. Each team has become hired killers after their stints in the SAS, and this is not a game for amateurs. De Niro is being held hostage by a sheik in Oman. Statham travels all over th eworld to hunt for his prey. He has a team that is first rate, and some of the action is complicated and breath taking. What holds this film together are the characters and the plot. We can see the action in many films, but the plot and the acting here are superb.  All of the killers realize it is their professionalism that keeps them going. Face to face combat and high technology are all a part of this play.

I liked this film, and as a spy novel/film afficianado, much of it seemed realistic. Of course, the director/writer took liberites, but that is necessary in this type of film. There is a little bit of love interest, and that creates a huge problem for one of the men,. The rest of the teams do not mention family, and it would seem in this kind of world, loners would be the best killers. I would have expected this film to do much better at the box office. I only heard about it once it was on DVD, and I wonder about the back story.

A big budget? $70,000,000, that should be enough. Who do we blame?  The director? It's his first feature! Well maybe that has something to do with it. I know I couldn't have done better, but the question remains .....what makes a good film? I still don't know how to put my finger on it. Perhaps if you just give the audience a little credit. We want to buy into the story and get lost, but we need a little more then what this film offers.... at least I do.

4933711,4,B0062P332Y,"KILLER ELITE is a true story taken from the book 'The Feather Men' by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, adapted for the screen by Matt Sherring, and directed with an eye toward speed by Gary McKendry. The bit of history that the film addresses is the aftermath of the Dhofar Rebellion launched in the province of Dhofar against the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, which had British support, from 1962 to 1976. It ended with the defeat of the rebels, but the state of Oman had to be radically reformed and modernized to cope with the campaign. The fact that three sons of the Sheik of Oman were killed by the British leaving the Sheik with a strong need for revenge so that he can regain his kingdom by sending his remaining son to a safe land is the springboard for the film's plot.

Before the film's action begins, the Sheik has taken hired assassin Hunter (Robert De Niro) captive because he failed to kill the murderers of his three sons. The film opens in 1980 the exiled Sheik (with his remaining son Bakhait - Firass Dirani) hires Hunter's pupil Danny (Jason Statham), a retired member of Britain's Elite Special Air Service, to kill the three assassins of his sons. A private organization of ex SAS tasks men headed by Spike (Clive Owen) is assigned to protect the British assassins. Covering the globe from Australia to Paris, London and the Middle East, Danny and Hunter, two of the worlds' most elite operatives, are plunged into a highly dangerous game of cat and mouse - where the predators become the prey.

There is plenty of incredible action in the form of one-on-one fights between Statham and Owen, car chases, and other acts of derring-do to keep the film rolling. At times the plot gets muddy and some of the characters are not well defined - those played by Domenic Purcell, Aden Young, Ben Mendelsohn and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje in particular. And of course there is the requisite romance between Statham and Yvonne Strahovski, which helps soften the film periodically. But basically this is an action film; the main reason it is of such interest is the fact that it is based on a true story - a story whose history is shared in the closing credits. Definitely a film for Statham/De Niro/Owen fans! Grady Harp, January 12",1326412800,29,2230,4.67175572519084
4933712,5,B0062P332Y,"Killer Elite is a highly entertaining action thriller that should appeal to anyone who enjoyed The Expendables and, maybe, also appeal to those who aren't interested in straight-forward action films, but enjoy more high-brow international espionage thrillers. Make no mistake about it, though, the action in this film is non-stop and, best of all, it's old-school. By that I mean, you can see the hits landing in the hand-to-hand fight scenes and when there's a car-chase, you can follow the action with some sense of direction. The acting in the Killer Elite is also praise worthy. Statham plays just about the same role he always plays, but, you probably alreay knew that. However, Statham plays that role better than just about anyone else currently. His acting, in that role, has always been solid for an action star, but in this film he seems to have improved. Deniro adds a touch of class in the mentor role. Deniro's as charismatic as ever, no complaints. Owen's very-good as well, but there are many excellent performances from actors whose names didn't make it onto the front-cover, among them are Aden Young and Dominic Purcell as members of Statham's team. In conclusion, I'd like to add that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper were two of the very few mainstream film critics that gave a positive reveiw to Killer Elite during its theatrical release. In time, I think many, many more people will come to agree with them.",1326240000,11,1428,4.8806584362139915
