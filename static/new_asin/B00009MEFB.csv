1885290,3,B00009MEFB,"Madonne! Smokin' Stogies isn't GoodFellas or even Analyze This, as far as quality is concerned, it's more like a home movie made by guidos and misunderstood by meddigans. The type of Mafia comedy going on here is more in the style of another movie called Mafia, but Stogies is made by and starring Italians-so already it's worth checking out. The dialogue by everyone is spoken like a cross between Jerky Boy Johnny's ""Frank Rizzo"" character and The Diceman exaggerated times ten-if you can imagine that. Stogies is a slapstick ride through Miami, basically it's a story about a week in the life of real Goomba-Guido type Wiseguys, the coolest kind if you ask me. Joe Marino is Marscone, Tony ""Paulie Walnuts"" Sirico is Boss Tony, and Frank Vincent (Casino) even joins in on the search for a million in missing Cuban cigars. The movie revolves around gold chains, women, money, cars, and making sure every hair on the Wiseguy head is in place. In a lot of ways, Stogies is more like another crazy low budget title, The Sopornos (go to Blockbuster and rent this flick with your girlfriend) as opposed to The Sopranos, meaning there's not much seriousness happening and no awards are being handed out. I've seen better, I've seen worse, but if you are looking for some drunken fun, grab a stogie and watch Smokin' Stogies. Capeesh? Best scene: ""Beer & Ice.""",1066521600,5,1355,4.770212765957447

7991787,4,B00009MEFB,"Smokin' Stogies (2001) directed and written by Vincent Di Rosa, is a
wonderful surprise for viewers who were expecting a straight-edge
mobster movie, but get to re-establish contact with their sense of
humor. In this instance, there are parodies, gags, humorous
stereotypes and a very large number of situations that will have the
audience frequently  giggling and chuckling over the 90 mins.

The most striking success of this film, is the wonderful soundtrack,
that is done to perfection, perhaps by a very experienced, talented
DJ. If a CD were put up for sale, many walking out from the theatres
would like a copy to play  while driving their cars.

Secondly, the visuals of the movie are great from start to finish,
from the concerted effort in choosing a number of sets to get on film
to relax the audience. For example, Miami the city, surrounding
beaches, canals, various situations with flashy women, vintage
automobiles from the 1970's, a Harley Davidson motorbike, action
scenes on a yacht, all enhance the spectacular.

Thirdly, the cast shows a much synergy ... the ensemble of actors
quite simply fit together like pieces of a puzzle, on the same
wavelength, hitting the funny bone of viewers, all the while telling
a story of smuggling operation involving Cuban Cohiba cigars.

The film hinges above all on Joseph Marino, playing the character
Vinnie Marscone, with a number of very effective supporting actors,
such as Tony Sirico, Frank Vincent as Johnny Big, Rolando Millet as
Nacho, Vincent Di Rosa, etc.

The picture was perhaps intended for the niche of Italian Americans,
who are too often stereotypically associated with the activites of a
small number of mobsters, who themselves, are often thought to use
colloquialisms, expressions, and slang also stereotypical. As such,
there's a lot of room for satire, parody of those aspects in this
story. Various foods are referenced, such as stromboli, grappa,
mortadella, a gag about a pizzeria using  a slogan recalling the
Godfather - "" A pizza you can't refuse"" with the logo of a  horse's
head.

Aside from parody, a number of gags are interspersed with a realistic
unfolding of the action, to keep  viewers curious and interested
until the end.

A lot of humor also is made up of creative phrases, quips, such as
""this hotel room reminds me of the inside of a coffin"" or a cleaning
room company made up of transvestites, which is  labeled ""Chicks with
Dicks"" or FBI means frequently busting Italians.

Fifth,  this  DVD is in the style of HBO,  mainly from the language
over 18 used, head and shoulders  above mere TV-fare releases.
There's a nice widescreen presentation and clarity. The editing work,
as with the audio, is simply impeccable, and done to perfection.",1203120000,,2740,4.9714912280701755
7991788,5,B00009MEFB,Congratulations to all who were in this film a great tribute to Indie film making and adding the touch of The Sopranos and Goodfellas Frank Vincent and Tony Sirico had me laughing out loud!!  Marone.,1144627200,,199,4.685714285714286
