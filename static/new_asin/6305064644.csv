7881505,4,6305064644,"A young man (Robert Petkoff) impulsively quits medical school and immediately finds himself involved with a number of attractive
women, all of whom want strange things from him (like holding onto a box for weeks and never looking inside it).

Along the way he meets up with various eccentric characters, the most fun being the late, great Peter Boyle's charming homeless
man/ex-cowboy.

This is the kind of whimsical film that might have found more acceptance if it had been made in France and shown with subtitles.
We seem to have more patience for foreign films that trade in smiles and light-hearted, slightly absurd romantic tangles, with
sexually aggressive, quirky and lovable women who may be inscrutable, but who are no less endearing for being so.

This is not a film that will change your life, but it is one you may very well enjoy.",1368489600,,843,4.840277777777778
