2769016,4,B000NIBUWG,"We enjoyed these films up to a point, there is a lot of bad language and so forth. For children we wouldnt advise these films. The good guy always wins, and this is classic James Arness and Gunsmoke.",1359936000,,199,4.2631578947368425
2769017,4,B000NIBUWG,"The title of this film was so cheesy that I almost skipped by it when I was searching for a worthwhile Western awhile back.  It's in black and white, but for an older western movie, it's better than average, in my opinion.  The dialogue was good and mostly believable, which was one of the things I liked most about it.  James Arness was never much of an actor in my opinion, even though I liked him and watched Gunsmoke often.  But he looked the part and cowpokes weren't very expressive in real life anyway, so that worked for me.

A lot of it is the usual:  a good man needing money; signs on for a bank heist deal destined to go bad; then they are on the run, one wounded (Arness) that will slow the others down so they leave him.  He serves his prison time for all of them as he is too hurt to run and despite his best efforts, is caught;  and the rest make their getaway good, taking Arness's girlfriend with them.  (Arness never did say what he did with his shot down girl friend after the showdown in the hills so I guess he buried her, or left her for the buzzards or something.......""

But it's the dialogue and the interaction with the other characters of the film that made it interesting and watchable for me.  The laid back sheriff who tries to stay out of the sun in the far away town they all end up in, (Emile Meyer, who played Riker in ""Shane"")  his side kick deputy that doesn't add a thing to the story but has to be there for the sheriff to bounce the one liners off, and that was the best of the whole thing; the dance hall girl, played by Angie Dickinson in her introductory role; Billy the killer strolling around hunting his prey, low and tied down.

For me, it was better than most of films about thousands of cavalrymen and indians attacking each other for long minutes at a stretch that was so dear to the heart of western movie directors of that era.  Cheesy title aside (what in the world were they thinking?)  it was simple and well constructed by a director who was honing his craft - and worth watching if you are into the Western genre.",1354579200,7,2070,4.244897959183674
2769018,5,B000NIBUWG,"If you are a James Arness fan and love old westerns, then I'm sure you will enjoy this movie as I did on dvd entitled ""Gun the Man Down"".",1349913600,2,137,3.7586206896551726
2769019,4,B000NIBUWG,"Not the best written movie, but being a big fan of James Arness, it was great to see him star in something other then Gunsmoke. Have seen other old movies with him but never this one...Nice addition to my collection.",1311379200,8,216,4.425
2769020,4,B000NIBUWG,"Above average western. If you are a James Arness fan, as I am, you will find this movie mildly entertaining. Beautiful Angie Dickenson, in her film debut, gives an above average performance. Cast contains several fine character actors familiar to TV audiences of the 50's and 60's. A great baby boomer nostalgia piece.",1183420800,17,318,5.018867924528302
2769021,5,B000NIBUWG,"If you like James Arness in Gun Smoke, you'll like this movie. I haven't found a movie with James Arness that I haven't liked yet. Trust me, you'll like this movie.",1182902400,12,164,4.32258064516129
2769022,2,B000NIBUWG,"At 74 minutes this late 50's B western  is still amazingly bloated with too much ...of nothing.  This could have been cut down to 50minutes and played on TV and still would have  been cliche riddled and boring but acceptable.  James Arness is pretty wooden...the villians and plot are a complete cliche and the ONLY reason to watch is to see  ""and introducing Angie Dickinson"" who  out acts everyone  else in the movie.  The Director Andrew Mclaglen, developed into a pretty good one and that was one of the reasons I gave this a try. Save your 10 bucks and put it towards a Rawhide season set or even a Gunsmoke if that's your taste...this isn't worth your time.

I rarely write negative reviews...but I figure there are many out there like me curious because of the  talent level and being a John Wayne production ...but its truly B or C level.",1179964800,29,846,4.506578947368421
2769023,4,B000NIBUWG,"In this 1956 film James Arness plays a man who needed money, joined with two criminals to rob a bank, got shot, his two cohorts left him for the posse which was right behind them, and his woman Angie Dickinson, in her first film role, rode off with them. Arness and Dickinson had planned to settle down and live a peaceful life on a ranch they would buy together with the money from the robbery.
(Watching Dickinson, it is clear why she later went on to star in films. Although her face in this film is slightly pudgy, she is beautiful and her acting is great.)
Arness is sentenced to a year in jail for the robbery. When he is released he goes after the trio. Their leader fears Arness and hires a gunman to kill him.
The film holds one's interest throughout, and is worth watching.",1479340800,,783,4.333333333333333
2769024,5,B000NIBUWG,"James Arness in a very different role. The story is good, the acting is solid. I highly recommend this for any Arness fan. Just remember, this is not the Arness we all know and love from Gunsmoke or How the West Was Won. He is however, excellent in the part. The story is in black and white so, no color. Interesting thing, I believe the horse he uses in this movie is the same horse he uses in Gunsmoke. If not, they are very similar.

While there's nothing original about the plot, the screenplay and acting are more than enough to keep you glued to the screen.  Highly recommended.

2769029,3,B000NIBUWG,Problem with this movie is not the acting. It was filmed by a TV  director. So it feels like a TV show not a  Movie,1469318400,,115,3.56

2769038,5,B000NIBUWG,I'm a James Arness fan! I like him in Westerns and this movie did not fail. Andrew V. McLaglen did a good job directing. Also great to see Harry Carey Jr.,1389052800,,154,4.0
2769039,4,B000NIBUWG,"If you enjoy old school American values of western  conflicted  justified revenge, the hunt down for greedy self-centered betrayers, and the simple  ultimate resolution for wrongs committed against a friend and partner, then Gun The Man Down(1956) is a pretty good movie for you. It stars the great  James Arness, Angie Dickinson(debut role and a great beauty)Robert Wilkie,Don Megowan and Harry Carey,Jr. Arness,Wilke, and Megowan appear again together a few years later in a wonderful GUNSMOKE episode called ""BIG TOM"". This movie's screenplay is by Burt Kennedy. The Director is Andrew Mclaglen. The movie was made by Batjac Productions,which was owned by John Wayne and family. The Executive producer was Robert E. Morrison( Wayne's real last name).Also  there are several character actors in the cast who appeared with John Wayne in RIO BRAVO,1959,(especially Dickinson). With McLaglen's guiding hand,the movie supports Arness' character Rem Anderson in a sympathetic manner his participating in a big bank robbery. Although Arness was playing a bandit and gunslinger, you can see the fine touches of the decency, integrity and fairplay ethics  of Matt Dillon that many of us admire in the character evolve.

This story could be an excellent backstory for how Matt Dillon became a lawman and answer questions about how he came to be as he was, the GUNSMOKE Radio Series, not withstanding. The movie debuted in 1956 and GUNSMOKE debuted on television in 1955,with that famous introduction of James Arness by John Wayne. The movie may have been in the can and they may waited until after Gunsmoke had been on for awhile prior to its release, just speculation. In the movie you do see that Rem is riding a similar looking horse to the one  that Matt rides, and during the second half of the movie Rem is dressed like Marshal Dillon,six-gun and all.  Those of us who grew up with James Arness came to believe that he was Matt Dillon and  we love the show because of the stories, scripts,writers,actors,and wonderful directors like Andrew Mclaglen,Harry Harris,Jesse Hibbs,Sam Peckinpah and the producers maintained the continuity of characters for over  20 years.

I recently ordered this movie from Amazon and I thoroughly enjoyed it.it is a minor classic.",1374019200,8,2258,5.139344262295082
2769040,5,B000NIBUWG,This role is a departure for James Arness and bears no resemblance to his Matt Dillion Character.  He plays an outlaw in love with Angie Dickinson (who isn't?).  He is shot during a robbery and is deserted by his two partners and Dickinson.  He is caught by the authorities and won't give up the other members of the gang.  He is sent to prison and when he gets out he goes after the other members of the gang who got away with the money.  The story gets really interesting when he arrives in the town where they now run a saloon.  Two of the gang members wind up dead and not by Arness' hand.  He captures the third and turns him over to the local sheriff.  The most interesting part of the film for me is the changes that Arness' character goes through during the film.  He turns out to be a really good guy.  I love James Arness and if you do then this Western is a must have for your collection.  I give this my highest recommendation.,1373587200,5,939,4.189944134078212

8177915,1,B000NIBUWG,"There's not to much to say. Not alot happens in Gun The Man Down & at times, it was boring. I mainly watched it because James Arness was in it but even with James Arness in it or not, I would've watched it anyway because the description sounded interesting. Maybe I'm just so use to him as Marshall Matt Dillon but I didn't buy James Arness as a bank robber looking to seek revenge on his partners who left him behind. I just didn't buy it at all. Before I watched the movie I read on imdb that John Wayne's company Batjac Productions produced this movie so I was expecting something better or to at least like the movie but there was really nothing special about. It just felt like your normal, average, everyday Western. The main thing that stuck out about it for me was the shoot-out at the end. Not because it was good but because it was so dark out, you couldn't see a thing. I'd skip this Western if I were you. There's better Westerns out there you could be watching. If you're a James Arness fan then you might want to watch it but only then because you're a fan",1482969600,,1070,4.224390243902439
