8499091,5,B006IXRKLU,"This dvd is wonderful. My 28 month old autistic son loves this. He likes watching the kids make faces, the alphabet train and when they do the differences between big, middle sized and small. It also features parents singing nursery rhymes to their kids, numbers and colors. It teaches them a little bit of everything. He watches it entirely and loves to see it over and over again. This is money well spent. My son doesn't like staying with many people without his dad or I being present, so if i need to I can play this video and go do a quick errand and he will not be unhappy and wait with my mom. I also have a 3 1/2 yr old and she is not on the spectrum and she likes this dvd as well. Very educational for the little ones!!! I highly recommend it.",1407974400,,754,4.136054421768708
