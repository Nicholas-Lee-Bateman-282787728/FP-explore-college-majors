7889752,4,6305476047,"Finally a movie about a man who has murdered but doesn't want to pin the blame for his actions on someone else. An emergency room receptionist, a nurse and a doctor ignore the pleadings of a desperate father (Kingsly) to help his five year old son who is critically ill. The son dies of a highly treatable burst appendix on the way to a different hospital. Six weeks later the father kills these three people and turns himself into the police. What follows is a complex story about politics, a man's grappling with right and wrong  before his own God and a lawyer (Baldwin) who, caught in the middle of the devine and the corrupt, faces the biggest moral decision of his life. The performances by all are excellent and I highly recommend this movie.... It's not a perfect film but beats most of the low-brow films resting on the shelves these days.",994723200,9,848,4.542483660130719
