8457490,3,B00553K9MQ,"Good movie, but picture quality is very poor, and pan and scan format is horrible.",1453680000,,82,4.533333333333333
8457491,3,B00553K9MQ,"When a passenger plane makes an emergency landing in Beirut, the pilot Jamie Faulkner (Lex Barker) and his crew are caught up in criminal activity, involving gold smuggling. Faulkner soon discovers that co-pilot Norman Jones (Mickey Rooney) is very much a part of the illicit goings-on. Now, everyone's in trouble, since Jones has apparently swindled his former cohorts, making them very vengeful. 24 HOURS TO KILL is a rather slow-moving ""thriller"" from 1965. In several places, when it seems as though something intriguing / exciting is about to happen, the opposite is true. Barker does his best stone slab impression, while Rooney spends his time looking pensive and suspicious by turns. Modern action film-lovers will find few enthralling moments here. It's not completely wretched, but don't expect a Bond film...",1448668800,,819,5.3076923076923075
8457492,4,B00553K9MQ,"If you are interested in seeing how Lebanon was in the late 60's, hotels, roads, historical places, then this movie is for you. the story is weak nevertheless I enjoyed the James Bond copy action. recommended only for the few",1390694400,2,225,4.65
8457493,1,B00553K9MQ,This is not at all what I expected. I would have liked to see more of lebanon and better acting/story line. Very weak and dissatisfied.,1378252800,,135,4.44
8457494,3,B00553K9MQ,"I still can't picture Mickey Rooney as a screen bad guy. Yet he is the heavy, a gold smuggler begging the airline crew to rescue him from the gang he's involved with.  They capture and torture him, he escapes once more to be bumped off in the return flight. It's difficult to find any virtue to root for where evil dominates both sides of the drama. Lex Barker is wooden as the pilot, supposedly our good guy, but what good does he really do anyway?",1343088000,,449,4.2823529411764705
