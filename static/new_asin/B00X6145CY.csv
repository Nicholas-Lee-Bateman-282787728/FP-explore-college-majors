8715143,1,B00X6145CY,"This is a great series, probably my favorite anime series. Im currently watching it on netflex but wanted to get a hard copy of it to have in case it ever was taken off. Unfortunatly, i recently discovered that Aniplex release the series in 8 volumes (4 for season 1 and 4 for season 2). Then they charge about $60 per volume. So if you buy them here it will be $240 investment for 1 season and a $480 for both seasons. Thats without shipping costs if there are any. I cant justify paying that much for any dvd series. Thats outragous. Im deeply disappointed in how much money they are asking for because it means i cannot get them. Alot of people feel the same. They want people to buy the series and stay away from pirated copies or illegal streaming yet charge $400 or more for two seasons. Unless you have the money to blow i wouldnt buy the dvds until prices are lowered. Unfortunatly this is very disappointing, i love this series.",1467504000,6,937,4.36
