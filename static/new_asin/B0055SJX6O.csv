4579588,3,B0055SJX6O,"I was browsing through the DVD bin at Walmart and came across this 8 Movie Pack. I already have Prom Night, but I bought the DVD for Below and Demonic Toys. The film quality is not the best, but what do you expect when Echo Bridge put four movies onto one disc. The movies are still watchable, almost VHS quality. The other movies are low-budget rejects, some are decent and others are below average. Overall, I was happy to get eight horror movies for only five dollars.

Disc One:

Evil Bong - (2006; 84 minutes; Not Rated - Adult Situations, Nudity, Violence, Profanity, and Drug Use)

Demonic Toys - (1989; 83 minutes; Rated R for Scenes of Sensuality and Sex-Related Nudity)

Meridian - (1990; 86 minutes; Rated R for Scenes of Sensuality and Sex-Related Nudity)

Decadent Evil - (2005; 67 minutes; Not Rated - Adult Situations, Nudity, and Violence)

Disc Two:

Prom Night - (1980; 89 minutes; Rated R)

Below - (2002; 106 minutes; Rated R for language and some violence)

I Am Omega - (2007; 88 minutes; Not Rated for Adult Situations; Brief Profanity, Violence)

The Legend of Sorrow Creek - (2007; 74 minutes; Not Rated - Adult Situations, Violence, and Profanity)",1349222400,19,1173,4.733990147783251
4579589,1,B0055SJX6O,Well ok these movies are not all that good. I knew that from the start but I still gave this collection a chance and man the blew that chance away. The horror not of the movies but of the boredom and remorse of buying this collection.,1348185600,7,234,4.108695652173913
4579590,3,B0055SJX6O,the other movies are good. but prom night was bad.  it was really dark like those bootlegs films. couldent see the killings at the prom. they should remastered it but no it was the 70s verison of the film.,1343952000,4,205,4.256410256410256
4579591,2,B0055SJX6O,"Although there are some entertaining movies on this set, the bad quality of picture and sound makes them basically unwatchable. So it's not such a bargain after all.",1338681600,,165,4.928571428571429
4579592,5,B0055SJX6O,8 movies for 5 bucks is not a bad deal for anykind of movie thats why i bought this =) i loved the evil bong its going to be my official 420 movie from now on =) i want the second volume also with the evil bong 2,1333929600,,212,3.4375
4579593,1,B0055SJX6O,"Echo Home Bridge Entertainment tends to put out some real stinkers. Do what you can to watch the trailers for these flicks prior to purchasing them. Most of the trailers are on youtube. If the trailers look boring, chances are the entire movie is boring.

Below: the only Hollywood megabucks flick in the collection. Nice ghost story lacking gore and most deaths are off-screen. Good cinematography and well-known actors couldn't fix the plotholes, however. It's worth a shot for a horror fan. 2 out of 3 stars.

Aside from I am Omega, the rest only got 1 star from me (Omega got 2 stars). Evil Bong: I like fratboy humor but this was kind of stale. It was filmed on a camcorder and was about something-something. Meridian: too much romance to be considered horror. Looked made for 80s TV. It was a bore and quite sappy. Decadent Evil: was the porn? It featured a few boobs, but, for the most part, it featured dolls and ketchup for blood. Demonic Toys: 10 minutes in reviewer can't help but shake his head and wonder, ""Should I really sit here and watch this entire piece of crap?"" Toys and a 6 yr old boy are goring people to death? What kinda crappy 80s horror is this? It took about 30 minutes for the horror to begin. Prom Night: boooooring. Trying to cash in on Jamie Lee Curtis' Halloween fame is what created this easily forgettable snoozefest. I Am Omega: Made for Sy-Fy channel. It had action and zombies. It's basically a toned-done version of the Omega Man with Charleton Heston. Legend of Sorrow Creek: filmed in Canada on a camcorder. The main villains are a chick with no eyes and some fat hillbilly in overalls and plaid shirt. I am not kidding.

All in all, this is not worth your cash. Like I said, view the trailers before deciding to buy.",1328400000,14,1758,4.522012578616352
4579594,2,B0055SJX6O,"These are mostly duds, but ""Below"" and ""Meridian"" are not bad.  However, if you are a low IQ stoner living in a trailer, you may enjoy ""Evil Bong"".  If you have money and time to waste, this collection may be worth a shot.",1323907200,5,222,4.1395348837209305
4579595,5,B0055SJX6O,wow 8 movies for only 7 or 8 bucks its worth it if you like watching kind of bad acting of horror movie the main movies i like of this is demonic toys and prom night but its all good i bought this at walmart for 5 bucks maybe its in your walmart who knows?,1315267200,10,256,3.672727272727273

4579600,4,B0055SJX6O,scary and a bit gross yet that's what horror films are like,1407024000,,59,4.0
4579601,4,B0055SJX6O,"Just saw what I pointed to in the title.

So far it has been very short movies that might have been made for television or at least cable TV where they can sneak by soft-core and the naughty.

Production values are high, almost as high as the breasts which get a lot of attention from the directors or camera operators or producers who fronted the money for the flicks.

Demon Toys is what you would get had Jim Henson channeled Stephen King.  Horror puppets out class live actors here.

The ending of Decadent Evil is one of the most raunchy I've ever seen. It might even strike John Waters as being over the top.

Amusing.",1403222400,,624,4.3826086956521735
4579602,5,B0055SJX6O,I was looking for b class movies and found them in this collection. just what I thought it was going to be.,1400457600,,107,3.909090909090909
4579603,5,B0055SJX6O,"Some of the movies are very good, some are ok and a couple are bombs, but it is less than $7!  You can not go wrong on a deal like this: 8 movies at less than a dollar a movie.",1399507200,,176,3.4
4579604,1,B0055SJX6O,I don't except collections of old movies not my style at all but for those how like old movies will be perfect....,1395360000,,114,4.2272727272727275
4579605,5,B0055SJX6O,This is a set of very good movies. sure to please any horror lover out there. A must see movies set,1390003200,,99,3.761904761904762
4579606,5,B0055SJX6O,Most of the movies were very good. I had watched a few of these movies but most of them I had never seen.,1377043200,,105,3.608695652173913
4579607,5,B0055SJX6O,I gave this movie pack a rating of 5 because I received a very good deal for all the movies that was on it. Some were cheesy and some less cheesy but I liked how the movies that was done back then to the movies that are done now have such a difference in them.,1375747200,,260,3.7454545454545456
4579608,3,B0055SJX6O,"You get what you pay for, and that's exactly what you get here. Some of the movies are awful, a couple are so-bad-they're-good, and a couple really are worth watching, however with one of those films, Prom Night, an old (and very, VERY dark) transfer was used, and the film looks almost unwatchable on this release. If you're getting this for that film (as I did), skip this and get Echo Bridge's other release (with the cover used on this package). Trust me, I was introduced to the film via a friend's copy of that release, and it does look MUCH better.

Also, I don't think it was a good idea to cram 4 movies onto a one-sided disc. None of these films look great because they have to share space with 3 other movies. I'm not sure why they couldn't at least make the discs double-sided so that each film would only share space with ONE other movie.

Also, the chapter-stops suck. Each movie only has 4 (most movies have about 25 on DVD).

There are no subtitles or closed captions, and there are absolutely no extras.

However, this was a very cheap release, so I guess you get what you pay for.",1373932800,,1098,4.367647058823529
4579609,2,B0055SJX6O,"Well, once again, this was time wasted that will be gone forever. I can make more money to replenish what I lost on this crap, but 6 or more hours of my life is gone. All thats left is the 2 disks that almost made me change my religion. This is not how horror should be! To the makers of these films, aren't u ashamed of what you've done? Their all bad & none of the bad is even worth laughing at. Shameful, awful...sigh...will we ever get the horror we crave yr round instead of one good movie every 2 to 4 years? I hope I'm not losing my faith again.",1370908800,2,552,3.981981981981982

4579611,4,B0055SJX6O,"If you are looking for top notch movies these collections aren't for you, but if you are looking for budget flicks this is a pretty good collection....I thought it was odd the original Prom Night made it into this collection though....not my favorite movie, but I thought it was higher grade than the other flicks in this collection",1363996800,,332,4.741379310344827

4579613,2,B0055SJX6O,"I am ok with this DVD set. It has some good movies, and some bad. Overall, at the price they sell this at, it's a buy that is worth it, and takes care of some snowy saturday's. I would recommend it at a resonable price, like I got it.",1357862400,,234,3.795918367346939
