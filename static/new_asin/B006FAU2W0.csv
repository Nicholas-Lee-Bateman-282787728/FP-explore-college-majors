8496974,5,B006FAU2W0,"This dvd covers everything you need to know about a massage from start to finish. My weakness with massages is my closing routine and after watching this dvd, I am more comfortable with that process. I especially liked the bonus part that covered contraindications. It gave me a better understanding on what to look for when first initiating contact with someone and whether they were the right person to give a massage too! Highly recommend this dvd!",1362960000,,451,4.87012987012987
