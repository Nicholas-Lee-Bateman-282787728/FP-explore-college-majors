233842,5,6300183726,"I recently came across Terror in the Aisles in my local video store and rented it thinking it was a different movie. What I got was an awesome compilation of some of the older, classic horror films.
Terror in the Aisles is hosted by the Late Great Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen. They take us through over 70 horror flicks in just under 90 minutes. Some of these movies include, Halloween, Jaws, Friday the 13th, Psycho, Carrie, The Exorcist, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few. Also, there is a brief appearance by, the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock. There were also a few movies which I have not seen that look particulary interesting such as, When a Stranger Calls and Nighthawks.
If your a fan of horror movies then you must see Terror in the Aisles it's well worth a look.",1028419200,18,811,4.561643835616438

Plenty of great horror films featured, but some screen time blown on movies like ""Nighthawks"", ""Phanton of the Paradise"", and a few other films that aren't intended to be scary.  Satisfying for horror film fans.",995328000,3,340,4.947368421052632

233978,4,6300183726,"I've liked this movie since I was a kid, and while I'm glad it's out as a single release, this DVD-R stuff is ..more or less ""junk"".. DVD-R is inferior in quality, easier to damage and scratch discs.. It's no different from burning something on your computer. What was supposed to be a cost cutting tool for studios to reduce over head and manufacturing costs, has turned into a collector and consumer nightmare. These discs are virtually worthless (from a trade in perspective), the covers are just xerox'd, and there's no reason when it costs less than 50 cents to produce one of these that the price is well over $10.. and it shouldn't.. I try and steer clear of these when I can: Universal Vault Series, Warner Archive, Sony Choice Collection..and Fox and MGM have their own DVD-R series too.. all worthless junk.

That said, I find it funny that this DVD: Terror in the Aisles is $20 (for a worthless DVD-R).. But if  you buy the ""Halloween II - 30th Anniversary Edition"" Blu Ray (Universal version, not the Shout! release), for just $12.00 ($15 srp) and Terror in the Aisles is included as a BONUS feature.. I'm not a genius or anything, but it seems to me which is the better buy...

Studios keep wondering why they're losing money on packaged media, and it's situations and stunts like this which make it clearly evident..",1395705600,,1330,4.627118644067797

234070,5,6300183726,I remember this movie back in the day. When I first witness it on HBO one evening and thought. Wow the creative editing on this movie was amazing and well put together.

A must have in your collection.,1365465600,,361,4.484848484848484
234071,5,6300183726,"The original slasher film era, ushered in by 1978's ""Halloween"" and running all through the early '80s, was what I consider to be one of the last great times for the golden age of the horror film.  It could be said that the absolute genesis for the genre was Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (1960), so by the mid-1980s, one now had at least 25 years of prime terror and suspense moviemaking to look back on.

That's why what I consider to be the best compilation of horror films ever, ""Terror in the Aisles,"" arrived at just the right time in 1984, to wrap up and summarize this peak era of chiller thrillers.

I was only 10 in 1985 when I first caught snatches of this one in its original run on late night cable TV, and let me tell you, what I saw scared the living daylights out of me!  To go from just being a precocious youngster who had never been exposed to much horror to all of the sudden witnessing the likes of Michael Myers' creepy featureless white mask or Leatherface's deformed dead skin mask was truly and genuinely frightening, and for good reason.  This is because ""Terror in the Aisles"" takes all the key scenes from the very best of '60s, '70s and early '80s terror films, and uses brilliant editing techniques to create a feast for any dedicated horror fan's eyes.  There are some movies that are far more likeable just seeing the best footage from in ""Terror in the Aisles"" than they are seeing the entire film.  ""When a Stranger Calls"" is a prime example.  Only the best scenes of Jill (Carol Kane) receiving the creepy anonymous phone calls are included here, whereas when I finally got to see the original 1979 movie in its entirety a few years ago, I was disappointed that the rest didn't live up to my expectations created by viewing the summary shown in ""Terror in the Aisles.""  In this way, this anthology is a horror goldmine and can save you a lot of money and time that you'd have to spend collecting each and every individual film.

Having grown up on this one, I have waited years for it to be released on DVD, having gone through a now degraded VHS copy and then one low quality bootleg DVD-r that was transferred from the (very rare) mid-'80s Japanese laserdisc.  That's why now, to see this legitimate DVD being offered that was derived from the original film elements is a dream come true.  Don't let the fact that it's technically manufactured on recordable media fool you.  All DVD-rs by Amazon that I've ever gotten have all been of the highest quality, and this one is no exception.  It is well worth the price.

All in all, the creators of ""Terror in the Aisles"" summarize the golden age of horror film making, the kind that we may never see again, as good as anybody ever has.  A fond childhood memory that I am now able to revisit again and again thanks to Amazon.  Highly recommended.",1360454400,8,2819,4.474609375

I was mostly curious as to see which movies they would use in something such as this, and i wasn't let down at all.  The plot might be a bit silly, but what a great way to show vintage and at the time, some newer horror movies.  Trust me, it took forever to come out on DVD.

OK, please tell me if I am wrong.  I could swear they cut the film.  There are some things I seem to remember from where I taped it from TV onto a VHS that I did not see on this DVD!  I plan to watch it again to make sure I am not mistaken.  If I'm not.....I WILL BE PISSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't stand it when they mess with a show like that!!!  Please, if someone else has purchased and received it, let me know.  One of the parts I did not see, is when they introduce some of the black and white pictures...like the monsterous gigantic spider, flying insect, praying mantis....and also toward the end when Donald tells you to watch out for the vampire, the cat, frankenstein, and the werewolf.",1347926400,,709,4.318181818181818

From the classics to the cookie cutter to the thoroughly idiotic and everything in between.  This movie inspired me to watch several films I'd never seen before and to look back on favorites lost in the mists of the past.  Watch for the late (and greatly missed) Donald Pleasance and also the late Fred Asparagus for a cameo.  Expertly written and enjoyed.
