4903020,4,B005XB8SGO,"I'm sure anyone watching this will see the similarities between it and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  I expected the same.  And, although there are quite a few similarities, and it's rather predictable, still it's a pretty good movie to watch. I like John Hughes movies, and this one is no exception. I didn't know Ethan Embry was in this.. a young T.B. Player! :)  Cute movie, nice story.",1344384000,,392,4.735294117647059
4903021,2,B005XB8SGO,I love this movie and watch it every Christmas. I was extremely happy to be able to finally find it on DVD. However I was very disappointed in the quality of the reproduction to DVD. I kept the DVD just because of my love for the movie. I have older movies on DVD with much better quality.,1344297600,,289,4.087719298245614
4903022,5,B005XB8SGO,This movie is so funny. It wasn't very crude nor did it have tons of sexual references that can offend. Just good and funny,1335916800,,123,4.166666666666667
4903023,3,B005XB8SGO,"It was entertaining for about 20 minutes into the movie, after that it lost my attantion because of some of the slap stick humor, and crude humor. The ending was sweet as the two poeple came together. overal it was good, but really not the best I have sen from him.",1335484800,,265,4.215686274509804

He has to truly love the boys mom (JoBeth Williams) to go through what he does.  He never gives up on the kid and then after the long trip home for Thanksgiving, he has to deal with the ex-husband.  It's got some very funny parts and some serious ones, but you'll definitely laugh your way through it!!

4903084,4,B005XB8SGO,"Ed O'Neil took a turn away from his character on the classic TV show 'Married ... with Children"" to make this family friendly, coming of age holiday tale. When a snobbish Military School misfit is left in the custody of his Father , they embark on a cross country journey to get him home to his Mother. Along the way they end up forming a bond (shocker), and when the brat learns who he has been traveling with, the film takes a dramatic turn, but does not lose it's funny side. 'Dutch' was a hit that missed at the box offices initially, but cleaned up a week later when word got out about how good it was. Like a fine wine, it gets better as it goes, give it time. Good Christmas or Thanksgiving film that also stars Ethan Randall.",1448150400,5,733,4.242857142857143

4903102,5,B005XB8SGO,"Dutch is a great classic of comedy but disappointing as the subs can't be removed. The movie is marvellous and the cast did a magnificent job with their performances, story is great. About a father and son relationship and who will survive, a low class father and a snobby rich brat and this is the challenge for the two. Great entertainment worth looking into as things go haywire quite a lot between them, plenty of laughs and full on pleasure that keeps the pace going. I rated this an A grade plus for a sheer delightful show that will keep your mind ticking over and one you won't forget in a hurry. So now to keep you amused pick up the movie and grab some munchies as to sit and relax with feet up for a fabulous night in that will rock your foundations.

They must travel across the country from Doyal's school home to his mothers for thanksgiving break. They are from very different walks of life and it's a game of who will break down the other first.  This bratty student has no respect for anyone who doesn't meet his high standards and considers everyone else in the world except himself as uneducated and worthless.

4903167,5,B005XB8SGO,Funny and touching movie set around the Thanksgiving holidays. Ed O'Neil ( Modern Family) is a riot. This is a 23 year old movie but the oldies are sometimes the goodies. Rated PG 13,1388707200,,182,4.382352941176471

This is a book end film along side Uncle Buck, my other hero.  Ya gotta see this flick if you wanna see a father son type relationship that gets tested cuz of a defiant boy and responded to with firmness and heart.  You can feel John Hughes presence in this flick.  one of my favorites.  What movie making is all about without special effects, with a focus on relationship and lotsa laughs.  I think God enjoys this film.  Just a guess.",1385856000,,561,4.168224299065421
4903171,5,B005XB8SGO,"""Dutch"" did not get the attention that it deserved. Either the critics over looked it,or trashed it. I am not sure. But for whatever reason,this is an excellent movie. Ed O'Neill(""Married With Children"" and ""Modern Family"" TV series) plays Dutch,a working class man that is on a ""full-blown mission""(as he calls it) to drive down south to a school,and pick up his girlfriend's bratty spoiled pre-teen son,Doyle,played by a young Ethan Randall,and take him back to his mother's house in Chicago for Thanksgiving. The relationship between the two don't start out very well by NO means...lol....but as they go through different trials and tribulations during their road trip to get back home,things start to look a little more positive between Dutch and Doyle. Without giving too much away,I would highly recommend this film. It offers alot of funny moments,but also a few heart-felt ones too. Overall,a great film that is definitely a must watch! Highly recommended!",1385596800,,964,5.185897435897436
