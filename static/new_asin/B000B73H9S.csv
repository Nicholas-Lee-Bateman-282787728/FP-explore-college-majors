8082672,1,B000B73H9S,"What I did not learn from the description is that this is basically a form of Qigong known as the Eight  Pieces Of Brocade.  The instructor spends a great deal of time explaining each movement, and then demonstrating each individual movement.  Nowhere on this DVD is the entire series of movements shown together as the entire uninterrupted form so that the viewer can do them as one flowing movement.  The viewer is instructed to fast forward through each explanation to do the whole set as a movement.  Impossible.

Don't waste your money on this DVD.  Instead I would highly recommend the DVD Eight Simple Qigong Excercises For Health by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming.",1242604800,13,662,4.857142857142857
8082673,5,B000B73H9S,"John Milton guides viewers of this DVD to learn how to cultivate the energy that surrounds us in Nature.  In our busy world, filled with stress and distractions, this DVD provides refreshing and supportive practices that anyone can learn.  Mr. Milton's instruction is very calming as he confidently guides the viewer to a whole new source of renewed energy and vitality.",1237593600,4,370,5.049180327868853
8082674,5,B000B73H9S,"I have seen many Tai Chi and Qi Gong DVDs and John P. Milton's 3-disk series is one of the absolute best available today! The exercises on ""Cleanse and Build Inner Qi"" are a fantastic compilation of simple movements that work to purify and build energy throughout the entire body, including the organs and bone marrow. The exercises are explained clearly and are easy to learn. I love the emphasis on practicing qigong in nature and working with the natural elements of your surroundings. The laminated cards that come with the DVD are great because you can bring them anywhere to help you practice the exercises.  I recommend these disks for everyone from beginners to advanced students.",1213920000,5,688,4.880341880341881
8082675,3,B000B73H9S,"This video is for someone who wants a lot of explanation on how to perform the exercises. He gives detailed step by step explanations and also coaches  the three students on their forms as well. What I would have liked to see was a segment where the sequences were run without stopping and with minimal talking. This is a great learning tool, but I wouldn't use it in everyday practice.",1209081600,9,386,4.514285714285714
8082676,2,B000B73H9S,"Along with other John Milton DVDs, I did not find them worth the money. It seems to give excerpts of his class instructions only and covers very little if you want to learn more than a few movements.",1207785600,6,199,4.2631578947368425
