8007646,5,630187501X,"Excellent production,one of best story lines to open a child's mind to know Jesus.
""Is Your Heart A Manger"" best song to open ones mind to know Jesus.  It is one of
my FAVORITE Christmas songs. I pray that someday someone like Michael Buble would
record and sing this song for Christmas. Although this cast did a wonderful performance.
I think it is a classic.",1357084800,,360,4.538461538461538
8007647,5,630187501X,"We owned a copy of this video when my children were little and they enjoyed it every christmas. The final scene brings a tear to my eye even now, 20 years later as I just purchased a new copy to watch with my grandchildren! PS...Seeing this video as adults brings back warm memories to our adult children of wonderful christmas' when they were little. This video reminds us all what the real ""reason for the season"" is. Highly recommended!",1264291200,,439,4.569620253164557
