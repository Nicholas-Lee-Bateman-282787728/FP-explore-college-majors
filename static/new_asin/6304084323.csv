773895,3,6304084323,"Pearl Bailey, Diana Sands, and Lou Gossett, Jr. all give powerful performances.  My favorite line was delivered by Diana Sands while pointing at her very pregnant belly.  Pearl Bailey could easily give Queen Latifah a run for her money if she were around today.  Don't get it twisted, I love Queen Latifah.  Unfortunately a very young Beau Bridges was out of his league, and the ending seemed forced and derivative (I thought) of The Graduate.

773896,5,6304084323,"I agree- they DON'T make 'em like this anymore- honest, bold, uncompromising, socially and politically meaningful... yet (lest we forget) ENTERTAINING. Like Stanley Kubrick,the late Hal Ashby didn't direct a whole lot of films, but most of them were built to last (""Harold & Maude"", ""The Last Detail"", ""Being There"", ""Shampoo""). ""The Landlord"" was Ashby's impressive directorial debut in 1970. Spoiled rich kid Beau Bridges, worrisome to his parents due to his ""liberal views"", buys a run-down tenement building with intentions to rennovate. His introduction to, and subsequent involvement with, the various black tenants is played sometimes for laughs, sometimes for intense drama, but always for real, and that's the magic of Ashby's work. The social satire is dead-on, but never preachy (are you listening, Spike Lee?). The ensemble work is top-notch, with a young Lou Gossett (with hair!) giving a memorable dramatic turn, and the lovely Susan Anspach hilarious as Bridges' perpetually stoned and bemused sister. The scene in which Pearl Bailey and Lee Grant (two more knockout performances) get drunk and bond over a bottle of ""sparkling"" wine is a minor classic all on its own.

774180,1,6304084323,"Once again, another great, quirky film from the past shows up on dvd...and it's part of this movie-on-demand program from MGM (following in the greedy footsteps of the insidious bastards at Warner Brothers who thought up this idea in the first place).

I've seen almost all of Hal Ashby's work, but this film has eluded me for the longest time...I never seemed to make it to a repertory theater back in the day when those marvelous venues for seeing older films still existed, sad to say.  And I think I can count on one hand (and not need all my fingers either) the times I remember this screening on cable or TCM (and my negligence in making a copy of it, too).

But I'll be damned if I'm going to give in, and kneel down and pay twenty hard-earned dollars for a simple dvd-r copy of this film, especially when NO extra effort has been done in it's production at all. Think about it, Criterion discs that list price at 29.99 are usually discounted around the web for about $21...and they have a remastered print AND usually a bunch of extras that enhance your viewing and understanding of the filmmakers intention.  What do we get here? Nothing! Maybe once out of fifty releases they throw a trailer on these discs...big deal.

So good luck MGM, but don't count me in as one of your customers. Until you stop your money-grubbing ways and lower the list price on these releases to a price that's affordable and less greedy (like about $10), you can shove them back in your vault.",1335225600,6,1480,4.507462686567164
774181,2,6304084323,"*This is the girlfriend of blaxploitation movie lover*
I was not impressed by this movie. I found it to be very racist and judgmental. I did not like the way that black families were depicted in this at all. They have sex to pay their rent or don't pay any rent at all?? The husband was in and out of jail? Come on! That was not fair. Then the woman has a child with the landlord and in order to save her marriage she gives the baby away? Really? I am sure that many women, black and white, have had illegitimate children and did not turn their backs on their babies for a man. Pearl Baily is a film icon, yet they had her offering the mother of the character ""pot liquor"" which is the juice from a pot of collard greens...I can't understand why something like this would be in a film. Pearl Bailey then asked the mother of the character if she wanted more ham hocks? Is this what is thought of black homes? Also, I want to make it known that the two sex scenes that Bridges was in had the women making all types of facial movements that implied that he was ""well hung"" like a black man. We all know that this is not true. Wasn't slavery enough? Why imply that the man had power that he did not have? This movie is a must see because of the demeaning nature of the film. It is good to have a wake up call every now and then that lets you know that people still have misconceptions and believe myths related to black families.

Sheltered rich boy Beau Bridges buys a tenement in an African-American Brooklyn
ghetto, with the idea of fixing it up as a home for himself, only to get deeply involved
with the various eccentric characters who live there.

While making a cartoon of the rich white world, it's a funny, insightful cartoon (maybe
not quite up to Ashby's great ""Harold and Maude"", but in a similar universe), and the
fact that no one in either world is let off the hook for their actions and attitudes, and
real people pay real prices gives this a surprisingly emotional edge.

While not quite perfect, it's worthwhile, funny touching and intelligent.

774297,5,6304084323,"I was very happy to see ""The landlord"",probably the most underated and little known movie of it's kind on dvd. I agree with the other reviewer,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!. I was shocked and a little disapointed
When watching Oprah back in 2006 when the film""Something New"" was being hailed as ""The first"" or ""the Only"" interracial dating movie made, on her show. The staff/researchers really fumbled the ball on that one, and sadly since I think if anyone in this country wants to discuss or at least  to understand anything dealing with black and white issues in this country, this is a wonderful reference point
and that fact would not have been missed by her staff. Too bad some folks miss alot in this country(for whatever reason) and are truly out of touch. However for those too young to remember late 60's early 70's race relations PLEASE,
Please check out this film,The music is on point,the acting is great, Beau Bridges is a fine actor and his part was not easy to play. The lovely Marki Bey,a 1970's Halle Berry type(only prettier and much down to earth sexier)in my opinion, is great as Elgar's love interest. I love the part where she tell's him he can come back to her place but he has to leave early. Another scene and the musical score !,that is perfect for the scene is the bedroom first and only?(tender,playful) with the wonderful Diana Sands who died much too young.  Watch closely as well the scene where Sands and Bridges are eating ice-cream and he's laughing and enjoying himself watching The Dating game, that scene speaks volumes, She's worried about everything, he hasn't a care in the world(that scene applies to differences culturally,racially and man-woman.) Not just the fact that she's heavy with child.
This movie is now being shown often on t.v. I won't say the channel.

 Buy the dvd. Watch it a few times to let it sink in until you get
it and then you'll have a better understanding of racial relation and both sides of the coin for what it's worth since a lot of what this movie deals with can also apply to things in 2010.",1281657600,2,2054,4.603825136612022
774298,5,6304084323,"The relative obscurity of ""The Landlord"" is somewhat puzzling.  It's also puzzling that it has only been given a proper DVD release until now.  It's trenchant observations on race and bigotry make ""Look Who's Coming To Dinner"" seem horribly dated.  I think that lies in the fact that the makers of the film take an unjaundiced look at their subject matter.  There are actual full-bodied characters here and not caricatures.  There are no convenient heroes and villains here just people  with their virtues and warts fully exposed.  You can divorce ""The Landlord"" from the time it was made and it's evident truths about human nature ring true today.  One aspect I found intriguing was how an unwanted pregnancy was handled.  Despite the grief that would be caused by bringing the child to term at no time is abortion alluded to.  You have to bear in mind that at the time the film was made Roe v. Wade was a few years away.  This is a brilliantly directed film by Hal Ashby who was making his debut here.  This isn't a conventional narrative with a number of flashbacks, first person narratives, and fantasy sequences being employed.  Not only is the audience challenged by the film's subject but also stylistically.  ""The Landlord"" is unlike any film I've ever seen.  I remember years ago a local film critic said he had seen the film some 50 times just to pick up the richness of it's detail.  The first(and last) time I saw it was in a truncated form on UHF.  Now having seen it as it's intended I now know what that critic meant.",1274659200,11,1532,4.594095940959409
774299,5,6304084323,"I first saw this film in the mid-70s when ABC ran it on TV. The movie grabbed me right away. I told everyone about this movie, but ABC never ran it again.

This is the first film directed by Hal Ashby, now regarded as one of the great directors of the 70s, and it's frankly my favorite of his films. Filled with energy and brilliant editing styles (Ashby won the Oscar for editing In The Heat Of The Night) and natural, low-key performances, which is unusual for a comedy from any decade. Visually it's just as striking, being the first feature film shot by Gordon Willis, who then went on to shoot The Godfather.

Beau Bridges gives one of his best performances of his career, as does Lee Grant, Pearl Bailey and Lou Gossett Jr.

It's one of the best edited films I've ever seen. Not fast cutting, but invisible and unpredictable. There's a brilliant scene with Pearl Bailey and Lee Grant which has to have been semi-improvised which is staggeringly brilliant. I've run it in classes when I talk about film editing.
The DVD could be better image-wise, but considering that it was shot on high-speed film at the time it's not surprising that there is a graininess to it. The color itself is wonderful. And, let's face it, to have this film available at all is to give kudos to MGM/UA and The Mirisch Corporation for finally releasing it.

There are not extras or even a menu, one of the new DVD-R on-demand DVDs that are being made available of older films from the studios' vaults, but I'm not complaining.

Finally, I was concerned about whether this film might be dated at all. It was made in 1968-1969 during the rise of the Black Power and Black Is Beautiful era. I gave the film to a close friend who is an actor and African American to get his input. He came back to me and said he watched the movie twice and that it was the film he'd been waiting his whole life to see: a film about the Black American Experience that wasn't trying to be definitive, but was completely honest with it's characters, none of which were caricatures or stereotypes, and where everyone looked like, spoke like and behaved like people he'd known and grew up with. This makes The Landlord even more of a rarity: a hip film from the late-60s/early-70s that still holds up today.

Thank you to MGM/UA and please keep more of these treasures from the vault coming.",1272585600,21,2774,4.982721382289417
774300,5,6304084323,"Although this is Ashby's first directorial effort, you can already see many of the themes and recurrent fascinations of the man in this early work.  The spare framing, the comfortableness with silences that would later emerge so brilliantly and patiently in Being There, and of course the offbeat and quirky performances, bringing to life characters that are wholly formed yet wildly funny and almost never otherwise shown on screen.

I also found the ""European"" edits (i.e., abrupt and sometimes surreal) to be creative, and of course the performances by many great character actors were superb.  In particular Lee Grant stands out, who was nominated for an Oscar for this performance.  Her drunk scene at the tenement is a hoot.  Also look for a very young, very clueless Robert Klein.

This one is a treasure, a slightly skewed and definitely overlooked classic and in my view an estimable addition to the Ashby catalogue.  Watch this one with the original Out-of-Towners and you will have a pretty nice two-fer. a slice of New York that is long gone.",1217808000,,1054,4.954545454545454
774301,5,6304084323,"I searched for years after seeing this movie when it was first released, but it didn't seem to be available on VHS.  I was very pleased to find a copy - in great condition.  Beau Bridges and Pearl Bailey are terrific in this tale of a rich white boy's foray into the black culture of the late 60's/early 70's - the impact of the tenants in the building he buys in a black neighborhood (just beginning to be gentrified) and his on their lives (his involvement with a female tenant who's husband is in jail).  But I think the best part of the movie may be Lee Grant's performance as his mother.  Underrated as an actress who I believe was mainly known on tv, she hits a perfect note as a spoiled white woman who can't quite remember which of her many beaus she actually married (after a night of drinking with Pearl Bailey).  Some hard truths about the gap - culturally and economically - between black and white are played out very well here and the love story is quite touching.

This is an art house film about a wealthy white man who becomes a landlord of a Brooklyn tenament and makes connections with two very different black women. I love the boldness and complexity of the film and the directing was dreamy and odd--making it a surreal visual experience. I was captivated, as usual, by the spectacular performance of the late, great superior Diana Sands, who died too soon: I think she would have been one of Hollywood's biggest black actresses had she lived. She is mesmerizing in this film. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in movies that explore race relations and the complexities of human relationships.",1146960000,4,828,4.838028169014085
774304,5,6304084323,"A rich, sharply observed social satire that proceeds from farce to tragedy with logic and integrity.  What a pleasure.

Although Hal Ashby, first-time director, and Gordon Willis, almost as new to feature cinematography, deserve the highest praise for their contributions, I split the lion's share of credit for the film's success between Bill Gunn's biting, hilarious script and the perfectly cast ensemble:

Beau Bridges is deceptively nuanced in a deceptively tough role:  Elgar Enders, an unmarked, unformed trust-funder whose scheme of renovating a tenement house into a groovy bachelor pad is his trial by fire waiting to happen.  His relentless lessons in humility would be exhausting if they weren't leavened with (dark) humor.  Had Bridges chewed some scenery, he might have garnered an Oscar.  As it is, he opts for a bewildered spontaneity that sure looks like great acting to me.

Elgar's mother Joyce (Lee Grant) and Marge (Pearl Bailey), a tenant in Elgar's building, have a lengthy, hilarious scene over bottle after bottle of fortified wine that would be a comic touchstone if only more people knew about the movie.  Observes Marge: ""You can get at those hamhocks a little better if you take those gloves off, honey.""

Diana Sands as Fanny Copee is flat out hilarious when the script calls for it (Broadly pouting, having sussed what a light touch Elgar is:  ""Complaints?  Well let's see... The roof leaks, the oven door's broke, the toilet runs all day, and you're awful cute to be a landlord...""), equally wrenching when the script calls for that.  Marki Bey offers a lived-in performance as Lanie, another of Elgar's romantic intrigues: Lanie is sad, serious, but not despairing.  Watch the ""Spinal Meningitis Festival Ball"" scene closely- she's given almost no dialogue, but her reactions supply all the eloquence required: joy, apprehension, tenderness.

Lou Gossett is first seen embodying The White Man's nightmare version of The Urban Black Male, but it's a put-on.  Still, the film plumbs the pain behind the role-playing, and finally it's clear that the pain is bottomless: (""D-don't let them transplant my heart til I'm dead,"" he pleads, his mind finally snapped).  Mel Stewart is the droll, menacing Prof. Dubois, another of Elgar's tenants, who would despise Elgar if such a feeling weren't beneath him.  Stingingly aloof as he is, the professor delivers the jab to Elgar's conscience that helps end the film on a hopeful note.

""The Landlord"" impresses first with its wit, then with the seriousness of its intentions.",1120262400,10,2547,5.138349514563107
774305,5,6304084323,"Beau Bridges is the son of a wealthy but racist white mom, who falls in love with a black woman named Fanny and who ends up actually having a baby with her!!!
Elgar's mother, Mrs. Enders is the owner of a building in
which several black people live in. Mrs. Enders cares nothing about the people except that they pay her on time with rent.
Elgar, on the other hand, is a sensitive and open minded
guy who gets along with everyone in the building with the
exception of a black racist professor named Professor Duboise (Melvin Stewart). Every encounter these two have, results in either Duboise mocking the white society, or
Duboise, try to show Elgar how superior black people are
to white people. When it was it released it probably got alot of controversy because interracial romances was something that just wasn't shown on screen. Making things more complicated is the fact, that black men and women still didn't have the rights that white people in the time. It's a great example of great cinema directing, in one scene, Elgar Enders (Beau) has just made love to
Fanny, then the girls leans over and tells him that she
loves her boyfriend Copee (played by Louis Gosset Jr in
one of his first movie appearences). The scene then cutaways to Elgar running to talk to another girl for advice while Fanny is telling Elgar this. Copee is a black, jealous and violent boyfriend of Fanny. When he learns that Fanny is pregnant and he is not the father, he goes berserk, beating Fanny into telling him who the father is.
Once Copee, learns who it is, he grabs an axe and goes
after Elgar!!!! I loved the film because it breaks several stereotypes:
*It shows that color doesn't matter when we are talking about love, it's all about the feelings a man and woman feel for each other that is important.
*Elgar represents a group of conscious men who don't see Blacks and other minorities as inferior. In fact, throughout the film, Elgar is actually happier with his black friends than with his own mother.
*There are several messages about the dysfunctional family.
Elgar's mother (Lee Grant) is a rich white woman who has everything, yet she is a cold, miserable woman.
It was interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. (Copee) as a crazy , jealous boyfriend . He usually plays good guy roles, but in this role, he nails his part by playing a guy who
has completely lost it.
The movie was directed by Hal Ashby, a man who has directed
several important cult films of our time including:
*Being There (1979 film with Peter Sellers ) *Shampoo (Great 1975 film with Warren Beatty and Julie Christie)
* Coming Home (A good 1978 film with Jane Fonda)

The movie started off really well, and then got a little confusing with the plot and the relationship between Beau's character and Lanie, who he slept with after a party and got her pregnant. There also is a lot of weird edits that just come out of nowhere, but it's a decnt movie about racism, the lower class, and freedom.
