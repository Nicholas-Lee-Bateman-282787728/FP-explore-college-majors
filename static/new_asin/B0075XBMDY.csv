8510672,5,B0075XBMDY,"An invaluable tool for students of Jewish culture and the visual arts. The Art of Purim peruses 1700 years of history from the Dura Europos murals (Third Century AD) to the art of Leonard Baskin
(a Twentieth Century artist and printmaker) without blinking. A tribute to the ingenious cultural adaptability of the Jewish people. The video highlights a remarkable variety of objects with complex, rich and diverse cultural meanings. It serves as a primer for those unfamiliar with the holiday,to those who revel in the traditions but wish to familiarize themselves with the visual record. The video's makers should pride themselves on a job well done.

8510673,5,B0075XBMDY,"""The Art of Purim"" is a fascinating journey through the story of the Jewish holiday of Purim, illustrated with a variety of visual art.  Myrna Teck narrates the Purim story told in the Scroll of Esther with 66 works of art, from Medieval manuscript illustrations to contemporary images.  There are also numerous pictures of the different scrolls and their beautifully crafted cases.

  You don't have to know the story of Purim before you watch this DVD.  Myrna Teck tells the story and describes the works of art.  The variety of images is astounding!  Most of the works of art are by Jewish artists, including 20th-century artists Chaim Gross, Malcah Zeldis, and Leonard Baskin.  There are even images from Dura Europas, a 3rd-century synagogue in Syria.

  Myrna Teck has a Ph. D. in Visual Arts Education from the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas.  She was the Project Director and Educator for ""Art as Ideas: The Art of Jewish Life.""  She has spent a good portion of her career developing presentations about Jewish art and artists, as well as art of Hanukkah, Sukkot, Passover, Torah, and Israel.  She is the president of Jewish Art Education, a non-profit organization, ""dedicated to bringing the best in the Jewish visual arts to the widest possible audience."" [...]

  I recommend this DVD for anyone interested in the history of the Jewish people, because the works of art make the narrative even more interesting.  Study groups of any religion would enjoy it.  It is also appropriate for teachers to use in their classrooms of any age.",1330992000,,1554,4.903846153846154
