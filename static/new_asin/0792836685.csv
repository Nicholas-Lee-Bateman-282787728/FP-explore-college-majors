142080,5,0792836685,"Warning-the following review may contain spoilers, so read carefully.
This is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. It has just about everything that horror films should be like. A great cast that  pulls off excellent performances,an excellent plot and an awesome  monster. The story goes like this-Henriksen plays a farmer who cunjures up a  vengeful demon that goes by the name ""Pumpkinhead"".He summons him  so that he could seek his revenge on the teens who killed his son in a  biking accident. Pumpkinhead goes around cutting up the teens one by one  sneaking out of dark shadows. The film is a horror fanatics dream. The  atmosphere is VERY dark and creepy,the  special F/X are superb and the film  is one of the scariest I've seen in a while. Forget the Blair  Witch  Project,this'll scare you to death. The unexpected sneak attacks by  Pumpkinhead,the constant darkness and crepy settings make this too  scary. The special F/X rule. There's a scene  where Pumpkinhead lifts up a  motorcycle as if it was a child's toy and throws it at a guy like a  football. It's incredible. Aside the excellent plot and terrific scares,the  acting is great and the characters are believable and have plenty of  depth. Can you see that Ed will do anything for his son? Brilliant. The  monster is imaginative and very likeable. As far as horror films go,this is  definitely one of the best. The only problems I had with the film is that it  was much too short and sadly,there hasn't been any other Pumpkinhead movies  (there's a sequel that I haven't seen yet.) Overall,this is an absolute  must for horror fans. Terrific special F/X,believeable acting,an excellent  plot and an imaginative monster makes a classic. Buy it now and watch  it. ALONE........ Rated R for ""gory"" violence and some strong  language",958089600,4,1807,4.842622950819672
142081,5,0792836685,"as a lifelong fan of horror films i have a select few that tend to stand head and shoulders above the rest. one such movie, in my estimation is pumpkinhead- the first one for the benefit of those misguided souls who  champion part two which was by any standards a flop and a t&a romp in  the camping movies mode; stan winstons creature an the lighting by bojan  bazelli caped off a good story and a great job on the part of lance  henricksen. i have actually experienced this movie being maligned on many  occassions and i could no longer refrain from comment. this is a very good  movie by any standards and in my estimation possibly the single most  underrated horror movie to date. if i were to voice any type of opinion i  only wish the movie had been filmed in the appalachians where the actual  story was to have originated from. wake up horror fans and check this one  out-you won't be sorry.",956966400,,899,4.36144578313253
142082,5,0792836685,"The horror genre of Hollywood these days has little to offer, serving us sequels to previous movies, creating trilogies and series that have viewers screaming ""End it already,"" and the popular teenage horror movies  that seem to have no tail end. One movie, though, manages to scare its  audience by using cinematic techniques to create a totally horrifying  setting. Pumpkinhead tells the story of a man and his son who live in the  country, just on the edge of a wooded area believed to be inhabited by a  witch. One day, a group of teenagers visiting the area go drag racing, and  kill the man's son in a freak accident. The man is torn over his son's  death, taking him to the cottage of the believed witch. In his quest for  revenge, he resurrects a gargoyle-type spirit that begins to hunt down the  humans responsible for his son's death. The actors in this film are easy to  believe, able to change moods from calm to scared to truly petrified.  Camera angles, combined with lighting and wooded settings, work to create a  suspenseful intensity that stands out from most other movies of the horror  scene. While this movie is not the best at scariness, it is certainly one  of the best in the genre, and renting it on a Friday night is a real treat.",954979200,3,1257,4.553571428571429
142083,4,0792836685,"Unlike most of the horror films of it's time this movie is surprisingly well done. The creature effects are spectacular and the plotline draws viewers in, an asset that other horror flicks lacked.",954547200,,196,4.96969696969697
142084,5,0792836685,"One of the few genuine horror masterworks of the Slasher film saturated 1980's. Stan Winston's generally unappreciated Pumkinhead is an emotionally powerful tale of asimple country man, Ed Harley, (Lance Henriksen) that  requests a infamous local witch to help him take revenge upon several  irresponsible teenagers that accidentally kill his son and flee from the  responsibility. Unaware of the ironic consequences of his unquenchable  thirst for vengence, Ed begins to  strangely connect to the monster that  starts to methodically kill each of his son's murderers one by one.  Though the film has a convential opening plot and predictable chase  sequences, Pumkinhead ressonates a forebodding atmosphere of fear, dread,  terror, and inevitable tradegythat consumes the audience into a mesmirizing  and unforgettable parable of the cost and consequence of parental malice.  Pumkinhead reminds me of the importence of storytelling and characteriztion  in the movies and how sorely they are missed today. A must-see. If you  enjoy sophisticated and moving cinema buy this one. P.S. The ending is in a  league all byitself.",952560000,,1123,5.529411764705882

There was an actual plot (and pretty good one) The acting is  great, Stan Winston's Pumpkinhead is an excellent creature design, I have  the Todd McFarlane figure on my nightstand. I highly reccomend this movie!",950400000,,429,4.4743589743589745
142086,2,0792836685,A demon called pumpkinhead is resurrected by a witch to bring justice to a group of teens that ran down a farmer's (Henriksen) son. A few spooky climates makes this movie watchable. But is let down by the usual plot of  teens running around screaming. Although much better than it's sequel.,948499200,,290,4.686274509803922
142107,5,0792836685,I grew up on this movie and I was so excited to see it come on to Amazon Prime! This movie is very different from the other slasher movies that came out in the 80s. The acting is wonderful and there's a deeper story to it than just some crazy guy running around killing people. It's definitely worth a watch!,1510099200,,308,4.15
142108,3,0792836685,"Well, it was 1989 long before computers came to our rescue.  About the most positive thing about it was it had a plot, even though it was your typical Hollywood version of back woods people whom they have never taken the time to meet but read about in a script.  For the rest you really couldn't tell because once again Hollywood thinks to make things scary they have to be too dark to see.  The set?  No idea, too dark.  The creature?  No idea too dark.  The acting was straight out of high school drama club.",1509840000,,510,4.25
142109,2,0792836685,"Stan Winston created a cool-looking monster (basically the Alien's inbred cousin) but directed a terrible movie. The pace is way, way off, and the characters are either teenagers in their 30s who don't act like real people or backwoods folk who seem like they stepped out of the comic strip Snuffy Smith. It takes about half the movie before the monster even gets conjured up and then with no fanfare or suspense or build up the movie immediately becomes a slasher movie so fast - killing off a majority of the cast within five-to-ten minutes - that you don't even have time to enjoy it. It proceeds to pad out the rest of the run time thinking of ways to make the movie feature length, such as having Lance Henriksen, who shares a telepathic bond with the monster, spend several minutes stumbling, falling, wincing and wailing and at one point even smacking himself upside the head. I remember seeing this when I was young and being creeped out by the creature. Now the only scary thing about it is the horrific realization that this undergrad-level script actually got produced and the universe doesn't even care.",1509494400,,1115,4.723076923076923

142113,5,0792836685,"This was a good watch. Honestly not the scariest horror movie but the setting was spooky enough. If you like horror, give it a watch. For real though, why did nobody shoot the witch??",1507939200,,183,4.411764705882353
142114,4,0792836685,"Not bad at all. For a film made in 1989, this one surprisingly stands the test(s) of time and more importantly, it comes from a time when ""special effects"" was physical, tangible art rather than an animated one. The film was genuinely entertaining and had a few scares even for adults, but the the reason I gave this 4-stars instead of 3 is that (as I referenced above), this will stand the test of time. Whether in 10-15 years' time it is widely considered a ""classic"" or not is another matter. Part of the problem with what this film will be considered in 10-15 years, is that the film market is flooded with fresh crap every year just by hollyweird alone, let alone the myriad semi-independent horror flicks being released.

The story is a relatively simple one of revenge, then remorse. However, the film also features a surprisingly-good and brief character development among the few principles of the story and I must say that the pacing of ""Pumpkinhead"" shows this film has the makings of a timeless horror classic. The special effects for ""Pumpkinhead"" are quite good and genuinely unsettling in how intimidating the character is. I recommend this horror film in particular because it thankfully doesn't ""over do it"" as far as violence, gore or body-count.",1507680000,,1264,4.824884792626728

The rest of the actors I do not know if I have seen them in any other movies. This follows the classic horror film genre, a bad thing is called on to take revenge on someone and then it plays itself out in the hunt and killing of people then the bad thing that did the killing gets killed, or at least put down till the next time. What I liked most was seeing the life styles of the local folks. Just trying to get by and live day to day poor as dirt but accepting their lot in life. A little supernatural old lady thrown in to make things really start happening. The ending was surprising, nice touch.",1505779200,,715,3.9722222222222223
142146,4,0792836685,"I honestly can't remember all the places I've seen this.

The story isn't all that original but it follows a revenge/horror theme fairly well.

A loose summary is disrespectful teenagers piss off the rural locals who then get revenge using a summoned demon.

Some of the teens you will want dead, and some of the creepy characters are good and creepy. I am repeating myself when I say the story won't seem terribly creative but it is well done, creepy and gory where needed.

This film launched at least one terrible sequel and inspired several bad spin offs but personally it is worth a watch when you are looking to snuggle or maybe for a god riffing with friends.",1505779200,,666,4.571428571428571

142245,3,0792836685,"Pumpkinhead is one of those movies that starts off really awesome then gradually gets worse.  At least, my interest dropped as the movie went on.  It's about a group of teenagers who decide to go on a motorbike ride in the desert, and they accidentally hit a little boy with glasses who's standing in the wrong spot whey they go over a cliff.  They fatally wound the boy, then when the father returns from wherever it was he went, he finds the boy lying on the ground only to bring the boy inside his small store for him to perish.

Most of the teens with the exception of one get scared and jump inside their vehicles to quickly get away from the scene.  You'd think the father would want to know where these teens went considering one of them stuck around so it would be easy to yank him by the neck and demand answers out of him, but nope!  Instead the father takes the boy inside  to try and save his life, but it's too late.

From here the father decides to get revenge on each of the teens by bringing his deceased son to a witch doctor, and let me tell you this lady's VERY frightening!  She resurrects the pumpkinhead creature after requesting that he go to the mountains to dig up a corpse and bring it to her, which he does.  Turns out Pumpkinhead is actually an alien-faced monster that makes cicada bug sounds.  No matter where the teens run, this creature always seems to find them (usually from above, reaching down to grab the teens and lift them in the air just to throw them down with aggression).

I'd say the storyline is really good in the beginning, but it starts to drag when the teens venture off through the woods.  At least the teens feel remorse for what they did.  Well all except for one.  And while the Pumpkinhead is certainly intimidating, the movie seems to forget about atmosphere and instead the creature suddenly appears and messes with the teens one by one.  There's no suspense or anything.  Still, I have to wonder, this entire incident could've been prevented had the father simply asked his young son to come inside his store the moment the loudmouth obnoxious teens arrived.  Nobody would have their young kid hanging around people like that, not to mention they're strangers, so the father should have known better.

Also the scene in the very beginning that goes back 30 years involving the father as a child with his father and mother... they lock themselves inside their house and refuse to open the door for a man begging for them to let him in.  This scene is more suspenseful than everything that came after, but the story doesn't really get worse until the focus is on the teens running around avoiding the Pumpkinhead monster.  This just strikes me as contrived and boring writing. Still, for those looking for a low budget horror, Pumpkinhead really offers tremendous writing for the first 45 minutes.  The father should have retaliated differently by targeting the teens himself I think.",1477872000,,2939,4.579349904397706
142246,5,0792836685,"Always a good movie to watch on Halloween.  Pumpkinhead is a nifty little horror movie heavy on atmosphere, scant when it comes to good characterization.  Poor Lance Henriksen had to do all of the heavy lifting to keep the simple-minded plot afloat.  The story involves a father and his young son living a quiet life.  Along come six dopey kids with dirt bikes.  At one point the father inexplicably leaves his young son in charge of their roadside store while he goes off to do an errand.  The dog gets loose.  The boy sets off after it.  There are two idiots on dirt bikes messing around, not watching where they are going, and splat, one of the bikers hits the kid.  The killer (John DAquino) flees the scene of the crime then does everything he can to keep the rest from calling for help, sealing the boys fate.  He rips out the phone line, clobbers the only rational one of the bunch (Jeff East as Chris), then locks them in a closet.  None of this makes any sense.  But it doesnt matter.  The grieving father (Henrikesen) goes to the local witch and makes a deal with her to inflict a demonic monster on all six of the kids.  Pumpkinhead doesnt bother to weed out the five good kids from the one maladjusted nitwit; he goes after them all with the expected results.

142339,4,0792836685,"Since its initial release in 1988, Stan Winston's (yeah, that Stan Winston, the late special effects maestro) ""Pumpkinhead"" has been too often overlooked, prematurely dismissed after the first fifteen minutes of viewing, and unfairly panned by critics and genre fans alike.  Really, there's a folkloric charm which recommends this film to those interested in folklore or, the traditional campfire ghost stories of old.  There are poignant moments in the movie, as expressed by Lance Henriksen, who plays the film's protagonist; there are also unsettling scenes courtesy of the eponymous demon-Pumpkinhead-itself.
  Whatever you may have heard from others regarding this cult horror gem that perhaps dissuaded you from watching it from start to finish, set those negative comments  aside and give the roughly hour and a half.
  And yes, it did spawn a franchise of rather negligible sequels, but the original Winston film does deserve a place along side so many fine fright fests that came from the eighties.",1464048000,3,1007,5.3354430379746836

This time, the story is of revenge gone wrong...monstrously wrong. Don't know why this critter is called Pumphinhead. It's head does not resemble a pumpkin or sport a head-full of red hair. But monsters often get stuck with awful names. What kind of parent would name it's kid Quasimodo, Godzilla, or even Jason? No wonder they were so antisocial. Stan Winston, a man who turned his own neuroses into a very lucrative career as a makeup & special effects master, hands that end of filmmaking over to others & gives directing a shot, this time. The movie's strengths are visual with the title creature being one of the all-time great monster designs. However, Stan's direction is just fine.",1463184000,3,837,4.943262411347518

That and a supernatural twist (which wasn't much of one) is what sets this apart from the pack of your usual slasher genre movies. While I was always a fan of the ""creature feature"" as a kid (even if I was too scared to watch most of them all the way through), this movie doesn't hold up well today. While CGI blood and bad jokes don't make modern slasher movies good either, this one isn't going to do much to either scare, gross you out, or intrigue you with suspense. The plotline could have been interesting, but it doesn't have the makings of even a cult classic. Looking back, I laugh that I was ever scared of these kinds of movies. Granted, if a big Xenomorph was tromping through the woods in real life, I'd be scared, but then again, so would anybody.

It grips you from start to finish. I do not want to tell the movie, so the only thing I will say is the old lady in the woods creeps me out . . .  ""What's do you want, Ed Harley? Say it. Say it.

142643,5,0792836685,"Pumpkinhead is a film brimming with all the typical horror tropes.  But what truly sets it apart is their elegant delivery in the form of good storytelling--the kind of good writing and well-staged events we seldom encounter in horror.  Oh, and EXCELLENT pacing, special effects and set design!!!

Makeup special effects wizard turned one-time horror director, Stan Winston (Constantine, Galaxy Quest) demonstrates a greater handle on storytelling and general filmmaking than most would on even their fifth turn helming a horror movieand he does it just right his first time.  He did an admirable job and I'm baffled (and quite disappointed) that he did not continue to direct more horror films.  The 90s certainly would have benefited from more of his work.

Pumpkinhead is a film brimming with all the typical horror tropes.  But what truly sets it apart is their elegant delivery in the form of good storytelling--the kind of good writing and well-staged events we seldom encounter in horror.  The scenes stitch together seamlessly and imbue a finer level of synthesis than horror typically finds.

In the opening scene, Ed's father protects his family from a desperate man pursued by a most pernicious demonic entity during a rather dire flashback that links our main character's childhood to the monster.  Now grown and a father of a young boy himself, Ed (Lance Henriksen; Harbinger Down, Aliens, AVP, The Pit and the Pendulum) finds his son in his last living moments after some intoxicated twenty-something runs him over with his dirt bike.

Much to my relief, what we don't find are a bunch of young adults who keep talking about beer and smoking weed and getting drunk and getting laid.  Their upcoming plight is not prefaced by drunk lap dances or cabin stripteases (e.g., Julianna Guill in Friday the 13th).  What we witness instead is what we might expect of a young group  (incl. Kerry Remsen; A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, Ghoulies 2) on vacation--mild drinking and driving but no one seems sloshed, typical fun behavior that's just a little bit dangerous, and a somewhat understandable (though not at all forgivable) reaction to a big screw up while one of them was on probation.  Even more rare for a horror film is that although we have a clear singular protagonist in our recently bereft father, the soon-to-be victims are effectively humanized when we witness that only the proby screw-up acts immorally after the accident.  Like I said, the tropes are all here, but they don't feel like the same old over-played tropes when handled so well.

Ed seeks out a witch--a piece of local hillbilly folklore--to exact his revenge.  What's funny is that Ed is the local middle-of-nowhere store owner in the mountain woods.  Normally HE would be the harbinger warning the younger city folks of bad things to come.  Instead it's Ed's fellow poverty-stricken neighbor (with five kids wearing filthy rags singing rhymes about the monstrous Pumpkinhead) who warns Ed away from pursuing the witch.  How's that for a badass turn of troped-up events?

The witch is great!  The translucently thin-haired hag lives in a fetid cabin in the swamp.  The set designers really outdid themselves.  She's creepy and says all the typical lines like ""you'll know when you find it.""  But she's just soooo creepy that it doesn't feel corny.  Then the pumpkin-patched grave site, the exhumation, the alien-looking transformationthis film truly has a lot to offer.

The pacing is excellent.  We consistently build towards the reason to seek the witch (i.e., the tragedy), the impetus of vengeance, the necessary ritual, some blood and black magic, and the mysterious discovery that Ed is now somehow ""connected"" to the Pumpkinhead demon.

Once it comes time to start picking off twenty-somethings the movie becomes a bit more typical, but remaining on the higher quality end in terms of execution.  Get itexecution?  See what I did there?  But for real, it's pretty fun.  There are various ""horror drags"" and a grabs-from-above that reminds me of Alien 3or, I suppose, Alien 3 (1992) reminds me of this.

Which brings us to the monster, which is undoubtedly reminiscent of the Alien Xenomorph, but with its own style.  It's slimy skin, protruding bones, gaunt body, huge head and long tail make this fiend super-creepy and I love the way it lumbers around and makes interesting facial expressions!

And while its appearance reminds me of Aliens, its behavior is more like Jason Voorhees as it lurks around the isolated cabin in the woods (yes, all the tropes are here), occasionally dropping a dead body in front of a future victim (for no other reason than a good jump scare for us viewers).  I'm also quite fond of the scene when it ""stabs"" a guy with a rifle.  Cheeky!

This film offers much worthy screen time to its well-crafted monster and the action is pretty cool, especially at the end.  The conflict is resolved properly with an ending that ""matters"" (unlike a lot of horror that just sort of ""ends"").  What's more is that the 80s loved horror endings that all but flagged down the obvious sequel.  That happens here, but in a most tasteful, thoughtful, and appreciative manner that will put a smile of understanding satisfaction on your face the moment you catch it.

I don't simply recommend this be watched, but that you just go buy it.  This movie contributed to making the 80s a special era for horror.",1460678400,3,5405,4.917218543046357
142644,3,0792836685,"Ok for a vintage flick and much better than CG generated horror flicks.
CG = Computer Generated",1460592000,,95,4.647058823529412
142645,4,0792836685,"Country bumpkin gets sweet, pulpy revenge in ""Pumpkinhead."" In creature/special-effects wizard Stan Winston's directorial debut, Lance Henriksen (""Aliens,"" ""The Terminator"") plays a loving father in the backwoods of rural America. When some city folk disturb his way of life and accidentally strip away his reason for being away from him, he sells his soul and summons the legendary demon, Pumpkinhead to do his bidding. Ah, the sacrifices parents make for their children.

Being that Winston's prior experience was in the background, crafting and perfecting all manner of special effects and the sort things that go bump in the night, it's no surprise that his film focuses more on the monster than it does its characters. Aside from Henriksen, who colors his character as much as he can with a good, stern grimace, the victims of Pumpkinhead himself as about as cardboard as '80s horror movie characters get. Even the teens Jason mowed down in many a ""Friday The 13th"" had a little more dimension to the ones here. All we know about these kids is that the jerk leading the pack is really good at riding a dirt bike, so his sins are forgiven by his friends. But not by Pumpkinhead, who wastes no time laying them to waste in the film's tight 88 minute run-time.

What the film lacks in character development, it more than makes up for in the visual department. Not only is Pumpkinhead himself a glorious chunk of animatronic genius, but the film itself has an ominous, almost gothic atmosphere, which meshes surprisingly well with the dusty, old-timey setting it's couched in. Winston sure knew how to make things look and function well and ""Pumpkinhead"" is a testament to that. If you can forgive a little predictability and lack of character development, you'll find ""Pumpkinhead"" to be worth summoning time and time again.",1458345600,,1826,4.944625407166124

142689,4,0792836685,"so look. i am giving a review on the movie itself. admittedly i am very disappointed because once i received this in the mail (after waiting almost a week and a half for it to be shipped from America to Australia) i instantly went to play it in my DVD/Blu Ray player, and was rather upset to see that it didn't work, and was not going to work either because i hadn't realised that this Blu Ray would be region exclusive to where i bought it from. i have never had this problem occur before throughout the whole time i have been purchasing products from Amazon. this is, however, my own fault and is in no way a reflection on Amazon, the postage service, or the movie itself. this is entirely my fault and i WON'T give a terrible review on a movie i have seen before and thoroughly enjoyed just because i was too foolish to read the fine print. just a heads up and a ""buyer beware"" to anyone that wants to make a similar complaint in future - as annoying as it may be to finally get a movie you ordered, only to find out your DVD player won't play it is the buyers fault entirely. not Amazons, not the sellers. the BUYERS.

this is an awesome movie, absolutely brilliant. if you're looking for a movie that will cause you to wet your pants in fear, i would steer clear of this one. however if you do enjoy the horror genre and also have an appreciation for makeup, costume and special effects, then i believe you will love this movie immensely. the aggressor of the movie and the antagonist (the pumpkin head) is rather amazing, and just so unique and different from any other villain i have seen in a horror film to date. the only creature that really comes close to it is the creeper from ""Jeepers Creepers"". i think this is a must have in any horror buffs collection that appreciates cult classics :)",1447113600,3,1802,4.315634218289086

Bitter and full of rage, as an alternate, Ed says he he wants revenge on the teens responsible. The witch warns Ed that going those measures will come with a severe price. After having Ed dig up a disfigured corpse in the mountains and performing a blood ritual, the witch is able to successfully resurrect the corpse, coming back to life as a tall, nasty, and skeletal like creature as the demonic Pumpkinhead.

142714,5,0792836685,"Pumpkinhead, the directorial debut of Alien special effects genius Stan Winston, is probably the greatest monster movie no one ever heard of (despite three awful ""sequels"" which only helped bury the original with mediocrity). An instant classic on its release, it's a very authentic seeming tale of backwoods superstition and bitterness. Widowed dad Tom Harley has very special young son, who is struck and killed by reckless young dirt bikers passing through their neck of the woods. He wants vengeance, and he remembers a horrible thing he saw when he was a small child: a creature known in a children's rhyme as ""Pumpkinhead"" who can be called upon for vengeance, at a ""terrible price."" Topped off by a heartbreaking performance from Lance Henriksen (arguably the best role of his career), the whole thing is a Gothic terror masterpiece, concentrating less on gore and shocks, than on tragedy and tableax of Hell. The grizzled visage of Florence Schauffer as the witch Haggis will haunt you for the rest of your life, and the repeated visions of the monster Pumpkinhead as he and Harley grow to resemble each other more and more, and Harley's anguish as he realizes he can't stop what he has started, make for great tragedy.

142790,4,0792836685,"""Pumpkinhead"" (1988) was Stan Winston's first feature film that he directed. He was best known for being the makeup and character effects creator for such movies as Jurassic Park, Terminator, Predator, and Aliens. Lance Henriksen (Ed Harley) stars as a father whose child is killed by accident by a careless motorcyclist. Ed Harley initially wants revenge and seeks out the help of a witch who helps him resurrect the Pumpkinhead. This is a generally well made horror film which alternates between a slasher style of film and a monster film. There are some genuinely scary and eerie scenes that make this a fun late night film to watch.

This movie comes with a large number of special features including an over one hour long making of feature that has interviews with actors, and the production staff.",1426809600,2,803,4.904411764705882

A film about a ancient Demon named PUMPKINHEAD brought back by Ed Harley to seek revenge
on a Group of reckless teenagers that accidentally killed his little boy in a Motocross accident
Silly plot/storyline but Directed by Stan winston,
this film marks the first time the special creature effects master Stan winston in the Director's chair

 & the PREDATOR creature from PREDATOR 1 & 2
and many other creatures/monsters he made for other films
this Low budget Horror from 1988 was first released on DVD by MGM back in 2002
with no extras and a Mono soundtrack

fast forward til 2014, Scream factory has released this film on blu-ray for the first time ever
with a brand new High Definition transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen with a new 5.1 master audio soundtrack
and i tell you what the picture quality and 5.1 master audio track is much better than the old MGM release
much much clearer picture quality on the blu-ray

Scream factory have also given PUMPKINHEAD blu-ray a massive special features respect
about close to 80mins of all new featurettes which can be played continously by clicking play all on the menu

this new Collector's edition by scream factory is Definitely for big fans of PUMPKINHEAD

who gave recollections on the making of the film

This doesn't make my skin crawl like the original 'Night of the living dead', but it is worth watching.
Really miss the older style of horror.  It seems like most of the movies today give too much information on the monster/villain instead of giving a little and having the viewer imagine the rest.  They also tend to rely on special effects instead of a decent storyline.",1411084800,,708,4.46875
142883,3,0792836685,"I am a huge fan of this movie and have owned the VHS, two DVD's, and now the Blu Ray version.. I also own quite a few of the Shout/Scream Factory Collector's Editions, and am normally very satisfied..

Upon comparison of this title, I noticed that the picture quality is really no different from the 2008 MGM Collector's Edition DVD release, which was also 16x9 1.85:1, and is still readily available, new, here, on Amazon, (as of today) for $8.35. Sure, there are a few additional features in the way of several new interviews, additional trailers for upcoming/additional Scream Factory releases (Squirm, Motel Hell & It Came Without Warning), there is a new 5.1 mix (the CE DVD was only in Surround) and there's a cool reversible cover (standard for Shout/Scream CE releases) which features the Original UA Theatrical artwork from 1988. The remaining special features are also on the CE DVD. Sadly, even though the film is in 1080p, neither the CE DVD, nor the Blu Ray are re-mastered in HD, which is why they looked the same.

The Scream Factory's Blu Ray of ""The Fog"" clearly states ""a new HD transfer from the negative"". It doesn't state anywhere on the ""Pumpkinhead"" Blu packaging that the film is at all re-mastered in HD, only that the ""Pumpkinhead Unearthed"" Featurette is ""now in HD"" (above, in Amazon's product description). Older movies weren't shot in HD, so just stating 1080p doesn't necessarily mean it's re-mastered in HD. Hell, even Millcreek and Echobridge budget Blu Rays claim to be in 1080p.

For this price, I honestly expected more; or at least a combo disc.. So, unless you're a die hard fan of this film, save some bucks and get/or stick with the 2008 CE DVD instead, or at least wait until the price of the Blu drops,or you can pick it up used.

Trivial note for purists and film geeks only: The film was originally purchased from D.E.G. (who went bankrupt) and was released by United Artists in the fall of '88, and it had that cool sliding UA opening which I loved in the late 80's, and it added to the ambiance and mood of the film.. The packaging, credits and trailer have always said United Artists, and there were a number of UA titles, which upon updating and re-mastering by MGM, received one of the two newer UA intros, but not this title. The latest UA opening (created around 2000) is still the coolest of theirs to date (imo)..

Back when it first came to DVD in 2000 it was changed to an MGM opening (Yes, I realize MGM owns UA and that MGM always appeared at the beginning). When it was released in the 2008 CE, it was changed to a modified and silent MGM/UA Communications opening, with no UA reveal. Back in the day, depending on the title, it would snap open after the MGM Communications, and reveal either the MGM or the sliding blue UA logo..  Anyway, the Blu Ray is the same as the 2008 CE DVD..

I do realize this is not something that the average person nor even the avid fan would even care about or notice, but for hardcore fans who grew up watching the film, it does matter to an extent.. It's part of the film, which is why studios cater their opening logos to the mood of the film, and have for decades.

I also noted in my recent Prom Night (Synapse) Blu review that it too was missing the iconic Avco/Embassy opening, which (for me)set the mood for that film.. and A/E is talked about and given accolades all through it's extras..  It's the same thing here.. However, in the case of Pumpkinhead, I think it was probably an error by someone doing the authoring who just didn't know or cared and no one ever corrected.. Oh well... I said it was trivial (lol)",1410998400,11,3612,4.510703363914373

142897,5,0792836685,"DISC REVIEW:
I love Pumpkinhead (see movie review below), it's a favorite horror, especially around the Halloween season, and one of my favorite movie monsters. The film has never been released on video or DVD in it's proper aspect ratio, so, those like myself who didn't catch it in it's limited theatrical release in 1988 have yet to see it in all it's glory... until now!

Scream Factory once again takes a cult classic title and gives it the proper respect it is due. The remastered picture looks absolutely gorgeous with rich colors and clarity that preserve the wonderfully spooky imagery director Stan Winston brought to this creepy tale of backwoods revenge. The image is presented in a sumptuous 1080 HD and there is remastered DTS audio to go with it. It's like seeing it and hearing it for the first time.

As for the extras, there are commentary tracks from writer Gary Gerani and the creature FX team and about 3 hours of interviews and featurettes to chew on. Everything from the previous MGM DVD special edition is there, as well as, some new interviews from producer Richard Weinman and actor John Di'Aquino (Joel), as well as, an interview filled tribute to the late Stan Winston... which brings about my only criticism. The Stan Winston tribute documentary goes on for about 15 minutes too long. At about the 35 minute mark, the interviewees seem, at that point, to be rambling on and it becomes tedious and loses a bit of it's focus. Some judicious editing would have kept this at a more reasonable length and still preserved the essence of it's fond look back at working with the FX legend and the impact he had on these individuals. There's a lot or repetitiveness as it drags on and would have lost none of it's heartfelt purpose with losing a few minutes.

But, aside from that one meager critique, this is an absolute must have for fans of this flick. It is a gorgeous looking edition filled with extras that take you back behind the scenes of the making of a cult classic that sadly never got the proper attention it deserved... until Scream Factory got a hold of it. Another great collector's edition from the awesome folks at Scream Factory! Pumpkinhead has truly been resurrected at last!
MOVIE REVIEW:
Pumpkinhead tells the grim tale of a group of partying twenty-somethings from the city who head into the Appalachian Mountains for a weekend of drinking and dirt biking in a secluded cabin and run afoul of a local legend who is quite real. While stopped at the rural general store of kind local man Ed Harley (the legendary Lance Henriksen) drunk jerk Joel (John D'Aquino), who already has injured a girl in a drunk driving accident, takes out his dirt bike and proceeds to carelessly run over and kill Harley's son Billy (Matthew Hurley). Enraged with grief, Harley turns to a mountain woman who is rumored to be a witch named Haggis (Florence Schauffer) to evoke the demon Pumpkinhead that Harley saw once as a boy. The demon is said to grant vengeance to those who call upon it. But, as both Harley and the young vacationers find out, evoking Pumpkinhead comes with a powerful price as not only will it stop at nothing till all it's prey, including good natured Chris (Jeff East) and his girlfriend Tracy (Cynthia Bain), are dead but, may take Harley back to Hell with it when it's done. Can a now regretful Harley stop what he started and save the remaining youths or will the demon of vengeance have all their souls before it returns to the pumpkin patch from whence it was called? Pumpkinhead is a very spooky horror dripping with Halloween atmosphere thanks to the great visuals from first time director and make-up SPFX legend Stan Winston. With a truly great looking creature and production design that oozes All Hallow's Eve, this is a welcome edition to any Halloween season movie viewing. Aside from his awesome monster, Winston not only gives us some great settings... such as Haggis' cabin, the pumpkin patch from which Pumpkinhead originates and an abandoned church where our remaining characters flee to... but, he also creates some nice suspense, tension and chills. The biggest factor in the film's effectiveness though, is imbuing the title creature with a great sense of character and menace. Pumpkinhead is a vicious and unforgiving demon who shows no mercy and even seems to enjoy taunting and then killing his victims. When Ed Harley, who is cursed to feel it's victims' pain, changes his mind about calling it, the creature still will not stop till all are dead. Winston, who also co-wrote, also creates likable characters for us to fear for. They are all pretty good people with Joel being the exception and even he shows us he has a soul when he realizes that his friends are being slaughtered because of his selfish actions. A key to a good horror is empathy with it's characters and here we feel for them as the backwoods demon relentlessly pursues them for a nasty death. Winston gets good performances out of his cast with Henriksen creating one of his best roles in Ed Harley and the young cast members, like East and Bain, creating likable victims to root for. D'Aquino does a great job of making Joel an unlikable jerk and yet being very convincing in his moment of redemption when it comes. Film vet Buck Flower has a strong presence as mountain man Mr. Wallace and Schauffer is downright chilling as the witch, Haggis. Overall Pumpkinhead is part slasher, part backwoods horror and part monster movie with some great special FX to present it's title creature and the carnage it creates and surrounded in some very spooky visuals that evoke the spirit of Halloween in almost every shot. It is an underrated horror that got a sadly ineffective limited release back in October of 1988 and then dumped onto VHS and then DVD. It should have gotten better and thankfully, it has developed the cult following it deserves and Pumpkinhead himself is now regarded along with Giger's Alien as one of modern horrors most iconic creatures. Sadly, the film was followed by three awful sequels and if any character deserves a reboot and another chance, it's dear ole Pumpkinhead! Also stars Brian Bremer as Bunt Wallce, a local boy trying to help the city folk escape the monster's wrath and Big Bang Theory's own Mayim Bialik as one of the Wallace kids. *** 1/2",1410134400,6,6313,4.742493175614195

142899,4,0792836685,"Its amazing how what appears on the surface to be another creature feature dressed up as a teen slasher film can have so much to say and deliver a morality fable for a modern age. Much like the fairy tales of centuries past, 1988s Pumpkinhead not only aimed to please horror junkies but teach them something along the way. At the heart of all the gore and scares are a few different messages like, Be careful what you ask for, Be sure your sins will find you out, and The price of revenge is your soul. Scream Factory gives a new generation the opportunity to learn these lessons while being frightened out of their minds with their Blu-ray release of Pumpkinhead Collectors Edition.

Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen) is a simple farmer who runs a general store in a remote community. He keeps to himself and raises his son alone after the death of his wife. Eds life is turned upside down when a wild group of teenagers come through town on their way to a summer cabin.  His son is struck down and killed by one of them riding a dirt bike. After they flee the scene, the boy dies.

Ed takes the body to a local witch who is rumored to be able to bring people back to life. She says she cant bring him back but will help the mourning father take revenge on the people who caused the senseless tragedy. She conjures the demon of vengeance, which goes by the name Pumpkinhead, to serve bloody justice on the teenagers responsible. But with every victim the creature claims, there comes a price.

Pumpkinhead Collectors Edition is the first time the movies ever been released on Blu-ray. Its presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1:85.1) with DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo. The picture looks great and is cleaned up without losing any of its real film splendor. There is such a thing as a classic movie like this being overly restored. Most viewers will find it easy to overlook, but the 2.0 sound will no doubt bother those who wanted a truly solid up-conversion from regular DVD to Blu-ray.  However, theres no question in my mind that the movie looks and sounds better than it ever has in the past.

The movie is rated R for violence and gore, profanity, alcohol use, and frightening / intense sequences. I know many people have issues with children coming to harm in movies, but Pumpkinhead doesnt feel exploitative when it comes to this. Theres also no nudity, which is surprising for a movie made in 1988 which includes a group of male and female friends on a weekend party retreat.

Plenty of top-notch special features come with the Pumpkinhead Collectors Edition. Actors Lance Henriksen and Brian Bremer are among the cast and crew who celebrate Stan Winstons life and work with a new tribute featurette. There are new interviews with producer Richard Weinman and actor John DiAquino. Six featurettes focus on the work it took to bring the movie and creatures to life. Audio Commentary is provided by Co-Screenwriter Gary Gerani and Creature & FX Creators Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis. Behind-the-Scenes footage and a theatrical trailer round everything out.

Pumpkinhead Collectors Edition reminded me of what a truly endearing and touching film it is. I had only seen it once as a teenager and barely remembered all the gory details. With great pacing and something to say for itself, it really does succeed at being a contemporary fairy tale for today.",1408406400,,3366,4.702886247877759
142900,4,0792836685,"I watched Pumpkinhead for the first time last night and I was absolutely surprised. I always thought it was a cheesy flick of the 80s. It used to be broadcast on local channels in the 90s (when I was a teenager), and later on I saw the videotape in the remote Blockbuster shelf where all the terrible horror flicks used to end up. So I always assumed it must have been bad. Well, I was SO WRONG. And I have been so wrong for so many years. Now, let's make no mistake here: Pumpkinhead is no masterpiece either. The acting is sometimes hilariously bad (yes, even Lance Henriksen is bad here). The screenwriting is sometimes weak. But the atmosphere is so incredibly good. Pumpkinhead starts with a very Gothic cold opening. Then it turns into a more classic B-horror, where hideous teenagers hide away in a cabin and are (rightly) haunted by a vengeful monster. Midway through it, Pumpkinhead turns into something else. It re-discovers it gothic eerie mood, and all of a sudden, in the midst of an arid backwoods Southern location that makes you think of Deliverance, you find a witch, magic potions, a cemetery lit only by moonlight, a terrible and bloody ritual, and an irredeemable pact with the wrong person. THAT is the great part of the movie. And the creature. The titular Pumpkinhead is a beautifully designed monster. The director, Stan Winston, was a great special effects of the old school, and you can clearly see the love with which he brings the movie's namesake to life. Pumpkinhead-the-monster is horrendous and demonic, and looks surprisingly believable even for the modern palate, acquainted to CGI. The scene where the creature comes to life is simply wonderful. The photography is artful and incredibly atmospheric. More than its (average) script, it is the visuals, the creepy realism of the creature, the almost Victorian beauty of a horror made of witches and pacts with the devil (sort of) that defines this movie and makes it so precious. Rent it, you will not be disappointed.",1406332800,2,2001,4.802898550724637

142905,5,0792836685,"Wanna know some embarrassing stuff about me. I fell asleep through Creature From the Black Lagoon and Boris Karlof's Mummy. Creature features just do not do it for me, even the classics. I'm not saying I don't like creatures. There are loads of wonderful monsters out there, but when they take top billing...I don't know. Maybe it goes to their heads.
Seriously, there are a few exceptions. King Kong, Terminator, Alien. And now Pumpkinhead. Number one point in his favor: he never speaks. Boy was I picturing some actor with a creepy tremor in his voice going ""And whoooo has angered PUMPKINHEAD?!? Mwah-hah-hah!""
No, Pumpkinhead is a demon, the result of an age old Hillbilly Voodoo Hell Pact that says if you are really mad, like blood feud mad, you can summon this demon up to do away with your enemies in the most vicious, sadistic manner possible. Pumpkinhead enjoys inflicting pain like a Cenobite that never learned to read. The costume is a definite tribute to Giger without being derivative, and the facial expression is priceless. He even has a cool weakness! But you'll find out about that when you WATCH THE FILM! IT'S GREAT!",1403049600,,1138,4.811224489795919

142917,4,0792836685,"I'd like to weigh in on the new 1.85-1 aspect ratio. When directors,due to whatever the circumstance,decide to shoot their film i a 1.85 or 2.35 aspect ratio,but don't want to use the expensive anamorphic cameras,they use their old lenses and just block out the parts of the picture they won't use. Stanley Kubrick did this often,even with the classic""The Shining"".Some people think that to show the whole picture,1.33 or 4x3 is best because it shows more video...WRONG! The director is an artist and shoots the film in the preferred aspect ratio. His composition is the matted picture. We were never intended to see the picture any other way. To use the entire picture is to ignore the picture composition that the director intended us to see. So don't think you're missing out on any extra video when a filmmaker uses this particular method,just watch and enjoy. You're not missing a thing,you are seeing the exact picture that the filmmaker intended. Now in regards to the film. There are things that I love about this film, the creature:it's one of the best monsters EVER! As far as the man in a suit monsters go,it's right up there with Alien and the Creature from the Black Lagoon! Stan was one of the best...monster makers. As far as being a director,I find this film deficit in that catagory. This film LOOKS terrific! I have always wanted to love this movie. It's dark and gothic,with a grade A monster and excellent acting,but I think the pacing is off. It has all the ingredients to be a kick-ass movie but just misses the mark. I find that all the scares and surprises come up just short of both. I'm not sure if it's a problem in the editing or in the way it was shot. Either way it falls at the feet of Stan Winston. I wish he had had a chance to re-edit this film. I'm sure with just a tweek here and there he could have ratcheted up the pace and the suspense and had a,truly,terrifying film. As it is,I'll still buy this blu ray copy as soon as it's available, and I'll still want to love it,and still,unfortunately,be just slightly underwhelmed. Regardless,Stan was a true genious,when it came to effects and is still KING of the practical effects and the best damn monster maker of the last 20 years! R.I.P. Stan...and thanks, for Pumpkinhead!",1402876800,3,2261,4.612903225806452

When a bunch of young punks messing around on motorbikes accidently kill his son,Harley decides to test his faith and seek out an old witch who can help him exact revenge upon his son's killers.

142938,3,0792836685,"I sat through the whole movie, and while I enjoy watching Lance act, this one left me wanting. Yes, it had decent storyline set-up, actually had a likeable plot that could be followed. However, the acting was a little stilted and half-done in this movie. Not quite up to the story, which really was well written. I liked it, and the only scary part was a jump startle done by the dog, and that was about it. The monster was well done, absolutely. It would be nice if all monster movies really tried to work the costume like this one did. Definite kudos to the makeup team- one of the better creatures made, and this was a damn good thing since the monster and the main actor pretty much split screen time. Likeable, not scary, almost goosebumps style in this day and age, if you added some blood and a little violence. That wasn't overdone either. Could have done without the off-set strobes signaling the monster's entrance though. That kind of cheapened it. Still, worth the watch at least once, to see excellent costume and make-up. Would give more stars if the acting were better and the silly strobe effects weren't so overplayed.",1387411200,,1135,4.596059113300493

His relationship with his son was sweet and beautiful, and was portrayed magnificently.  It brought the level of this movie up to well beyond a ""B"" horror film.  PLUS...this was Stan Winstons (Special Effects Artist) directoral debut.  He supervised the work of the creature which was excellent and very scary.  So clever the way it takes on the face of Lance's character near the end...how they become one once his vengence is near satisfaction.

This film was based on a poem that was written by Ed Justin.

Side Note: There is a family in the beginning of the film at Lance Henriksen's grocery store; the youngest girl is Mayim Bialik (at 12 yrs old) of the show Blossom and Sheldon's girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler on Big Bang Theory!

142993,5,0792836685,"This film is really underrated and to the people who think the suit used was originally an alien suit you're very wrong. The Pumpkinhead suit and film was fabricated by the same people who worked on Alien most notably Stan Winston. I'll go over the good, the bad, and the ugly.

The Good: Well acted, well written, well directed, great special effects, well-developed characters, creepy atmosphere, astonishing scenery, suspenseful, great score, and fast paced.

The Bad: Nothing is bad in this film.

The Ugly: Nothing down right horrible or terrible either.

The Story: Some city folk, Chris, Joel, Kim, Steve, Tracy, and Maggie are passing through the country-side and stop at Ed Harley's (Lance Henriksen) little shop, Ed runs the shop with his young son Billy. Billy has a pet dog named Gypsy. Chris (I think) and Joel  get out their dirt bikes and race each other in the nearby field. Mr. Wallace and his kids come to the shop and need Ed to get something for them. Ed tells Billy to stay put while he runs an errand. Ed and the Wallace family leave. Soon after Gypsy runs to chase after the racing dirt-bikers. Billy chases after Gypsy, not realizing that the young boy has run into the field, Joel accidentally runs over Billy. Joel and the others run from the scene except for Chris who when Ed arrives tries to tell him how it happened. Ed gives Chris an evil gaze. Joel begins acting like a complete ass because he is already on probation for a similar incident. Ed with the help of Mr. Wallace's oldest son goes to Haggis a witch. At a young age Ed witnessed Pumpkinhead kill someone. Haggis and Ed bring forth the evil demon of vengeance Pumpkinhead. Pumpkinhead gets his name because he comes from a nearby Pumpkin patch and his head is similar to that of a pumpkin. Whatever Pumpkinhead does or what happens to him Ed can feel and vice verse. Pumpkinhead slowly kills who ever gets in his way and the people who caused Billy's tragic death.

There isn't much blood so kids of the age of 10 and up can watch it. The film mostly takes place in the creepy, foggy, forest and there's a very creepy and unique scene in which Pumpkinhead walks through an old rubble-like remains of a church. Haggis is a cool character and looks similar to my Grandmother, I'm not saying that in a mean way they just so happen to have the same hair, same skin, voice, and similar home styles except my grand mom does not live in a little shack. This film is ultimately a classic and one of my favorites the monster is one of my favorites too and he belongs alongside the classic universal monsters of the 30s and 40s. There were 3 sequels made, Pumpkinhead 2: Blood Wings 1994 (okay), Pumpkinhead 3: Ashes to Ashes which is pure s***, and Pumpkinhead 4: Blood Feud which is so-so. None of the sequels live up to the original especially part 3, if you decide to see any of the sequels see parts 2 and 4. Parts 2 and 4 actually use suits while part 3 uses cgi which looks as bad as Birdemic: Shock and crap. The suit in the second film is not lean and sleek looking and looks rubbery but it still is an okay suit, the suit in part 4 looks better than the suit in part 2 and not as goofy.  The first Pumpkinhead gets 5/5 stars, part 2 gets 3/5 stars, part 3 gets 0/5 stars, and part 4 gets 3/5 stars.

Pumpkinhead (the film) was inspired by Ed Justin's poem with the same name, which goes like this
Keep away from Pumpkinhead,
Unless you're tired of living,
His enemies are mostly dead,
He's mean and unforgiving,
Laugh at him and you're undone,
But in some dreadful fashion,
Vengeance, he considers fun,
And plans it with a passion,
Time will not erase or blot,
A plot that he has brewing,
It's when you think that he's forgot,
He'll conjure your undoing,
Bolted doors and windows barred,
Guard dogs prowling in the yard,
Won't protect you in your bed,
Nothing will, from Pumpkinhead.

Pumpkinhead had a comic book of a 2 issue mini-series, an action figure, and The Misfits made a song about him entitled Pumpkin Head which was featured on their album Famous Monsters.

The extras included in the DVD are great, giving background info on the production, effects, settings, cast, etc. As for the movie itself, it's a gem of the horror genre. It's use of lighting and shadows, combined with the backwoods, isolated setting, make for a tense and eerie feel that locks you into the movie. The movie has an actual plot, it's not simply a scary-looking guy knocking off kids for who-knows-what reason. The witch, Haggis, plays a great, although small, role. She and her house look very authentic, and she's one evil woman! The creature, Pumpkinhead, is great-looking, huge stature-wise. I thought what was great and especially scary about him was that he had one singular purpose - to exact revenge on the people responsible for the wrong that was done, and that's all. Another pleasing element to Pumpkinhead was that this movie had a minimum of gore. So many ""horror"" movies nowadays make the mistake of believing blood and violence are actually scary, when they are not. This movie builds suspense and tension with a real story, and there is an actual moral involved. Lance Henriksen was great as Ed Harley. He brought a great, authentic feel to his character. I purposely wrote this without giving away the storyline because, well, YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! In closing, a little trivia. I am not totally sure, but I think the house the kids are in is the same house used in Friday the 13th The Final Chapter. In the movie, no definite location was given, but we do get a clue that it's in Arkansas. Pay attention to something Haggis says to Ed. Also, Pumpkinhead actually talks a little a few times. He calls out the names of the people he is about to kill, or has just killed. What a guy! Happy viewing.",1353715200,,1850,4.6432926829268295

Pumpkinhead (1988) is a cult classic horror movie that features a unique alien-like monster, a creepy atmosphere during the night scenes, and some pretty good special effects for a late '80s horror movie.  Some of the night scenes have a Sleepy Hollow (1999) feel to them.  There are two drawbacks to this movie, one being that it drags in places, the other being that it uses the same predictable formula that so many slasher horror movies use - some young people being chased by some monster in a wooded area and they're frantically trying to escape from it.  However, the way the monster is created is unique and the dual character aspect to the monster is cool.  Other than these drawbacks, it's a solid '80s horror movie that's quite entertaining.  Recommended.",1351900800,,877,4.730263157894737

143029,4,0792836685,Lance is the best.  I love the original Pumkinhead.  The others are... well like most sequels...  Give it a try.,1341532800,2,112,4.5
143030,3,0792836685,"Released in 1988, ""Pumpkinhead"" stars Lance Henriksen as Ed Harley, a California backwoodsman whose son is accidently killed by some vacationing city kids on dirt bikes. Due to a childhood experience, Harley doesn't turn to God for help but to a backwoods witch who has the power to resurrect `Pumpkinhead,' a menacing demon that can only function in the natural realm via the spirit of hateful revenge, in this case Ed Harley's vengeance. Havoc ensues.

The best thing ""Pumpkinhead"" has going for it is an outstanding monster that towers over its powerless victims, created by special effects artist Stan Winston in his directorial debut. Really, the creature is as good or better than the Alien/Aliens monsters.

Another strong point is the link between the creature and one of the characters and what has to be done to possibly end its reign of terror: The spirit of revenge can only be terminated by the spirit of selfless sacrifice, which is the Christ spirit.

Other positives include a solid cast, a totally serious & creepy vibe throughout and quality backwoods locations (California).

The only real negative is that, soon after the monster is released and starts its rampage (at around the 50-minute mark), the film clearly loses its footing and tempts the viewer to tune out, but it thankfully gets back on track. A minor negative is that the film features some quality women, but the fimmakers failed to do much worthwhile with them.

Although the creature is great and the way it functions is original, the basic plot is, of course, old hat, i.e. youths chased by some boogeyman in the deep woods. In that sense, ""Pumpkinhead"" is reminiscent of the 80's ""Friday the 13th"" flicks, mainly the first two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-1980-Friday-the-13th-Part-2-1981-Double-Feature/dp/B000PHX5NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th (1980) / Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) (Double Feature)</a>, since they were the most serious (with the 3rd installment a semi-goofy vibe was introduced), but the ""Friday"" flicks have better women and are overall more entertaining IMHO.

GRADE: C+ or B- (although the creature, Henriksen and the creepy ambiance all rate A+)",1335571200,2,2234,5.423631123919308
143031,4,0792836685,"I wouldn't say this is a little known film, but you won't find it on a lot of ""Top Horror Classics"" lists either. Lance Henriksen may be one of the best b-movie / supporting role actors in recent memory, and he again carries a non-blockbuster to respectable heights. I saw him in Stone Cold with Brian Bosworth and he and his character made a somewhat forgetable film into a decent following of fans. Pumpkinhead is a similar picture, but the story, production, and good ole Pumpkinhead lend a fair hand as well.  IMO with a little better casting and direction, this film could rival much more notable creature flicks.  On the lines of Jeepers Creepers, but way more sinister!  Gave it four stars due to the fact it could have been better, but with the budget I can't complain too much. Very memorable, and not just in the horror genre.  It is on my list of favorite movies period.",1330387200,,881,4.522012578616352
143032,5,0792836685,"The movie was created and directed by special effects effort Stan Winston, so that should already tell you that you're in for a good ride. The monster was stylish and effective, not to mention pretty horrific when they first expose the thing in full view. Yet i have to say- it did in some ways resemble the creatures out of the Alien movies, in which Winston also did effects for. But no matter, because i have to say this easily tops the alien creatures. Due to the wicked and evil personality that the monster eluminates, including the dreadful and dangerous atmosphere that is given off, the viewer will just be entertained by its mere presence on the screen. The plot is simple, however creative in details...

After some city kids accidentally kill the son of a secluded farmer, Ed Harley, he puts his faith in a local legend, known as Pumpkinhead. the legend says that anyone wronged can obtain revenge by summoning this demon to murder the ones responsible. After locating the old witch of the woods, he aquires the materials she demands to perform the blood ritual and unleash the walking vengeance. But all this comes at a terrible price, Ed soon finds out, and he realizes what he's done has not only hurt him and the other innocents around him, but damned his soul for all eternity. Hoping for some redemption, he sets off to stop the evil that is ruthlessly slaughtering the teens and coming closer to transforming into Ed's likeness...

A great horror film that presents some scary ideas and pop-out scenes,i believe this is at the least a movie you must say you have watched in your lifetime. The low grade acting from the teens striving to escape from the monster is greatly ignored compared to Lance Henricksen's applauding performance as the grieving Ed Harley, who shows that the loss of his son really impacts him more than his tough shelled exterior gives off. This really dives deep into some of the hidden fears of the imagination and gets a message across (greater than i've ever seen in most horror movies) that revenge can't satisfy the loss of loved ones. My advice is to see this movie if you haven't and keep an open mind about the (relative) realness of the situation at hand.",1327017600,,2206,4.668380462724936

143035,4,0792836685,"With Halloween fast approaching, it seemed appropriate to revisit some of the iconic horror films of my teenage years. Among those was PUMPKINHEAD, the directorial debut of Stan Winston, the makeup-effects legend who, it so happens, trained about a third of the guys I presently work with in the MPFX business. I'm glad I did. It's a much better film than I remember, and well worth a horror fan's time.

PUMPKINHEAD is a straightforward revenge story with a back-country twang. When Ed Harley's only son Billy is accidentally killed by some joyriding cityfolk, Harley (played by the great Lance Henriksen) descends into the deepest, spookiest hollers of his Western Virginia mountain country and strikes a deal with an evil witch named Haggis. In return for all his wealth, she will summon ""Pumpkinhead"", a ghastly demon who will find and slaughter all those responsible. She warns him what he asks ""has a powerful price"" but doesn't elaborate, and Harley is too addled by grief to realize she ain't talking about money. Haggis takes some of his blood and uses it to animate a shriveled, mummified corpse which she has directed Harley to disinter from a cemetary in a creepy pumpkin patch, and soon Pumpkinhead is running amok, cruelly toying with and then killing each of those responsible for Billy Harley's death. Harley soon discovers, however, that he and the creature are linked by his blood; he sees what it sees and feels what it feels; and after experiencing a few vicious murders he decides that revenge is an overrated pleasure. He tries to get Haggis to call off the beast, and when she scornfully refuses, he elects to try to save the few remaining cityfolk from the monster he unleashed upon them, even if it costs him his life.

PUMPKINHEAD combines many classic horror elements -- it reminded me in turn of such disparate horror flicks as FRIDAY THE 13TH, HELLRAISER, FRANKENSTEIN, EVENT HORIZON, and PET SEMATARY. That is to say, it's part slasher and part monster movie, but also examines the price of revenge, of tampering with forbidden knowledge, and of making deals with the devil. What sets it apart from most horrors, however, is the tragic element. Matthew Hurley, the actor who plays Billy Harley, gives such an adorable performance that his death is almost unbearable to watch, as is the tenderness with which Henriksen handles his broken body. The grief he was portraying seemed absolutely real, as did his remorse when he realizes his vengeance has gone too far. And Florence Shauffler, who portrays Haggis, gives one of the most gleefully evil performances I've yet seen, doing a huge amount with only a few short scenes.

Of course the film has many problems. The editing is clumsy and the cinematography sometimes amateurish at crucial moments, the often clever script has some jarringly bad dialogue, and some of the acting is right out of the ""Slasher Fodder School"" that turned out so many graduates in the 1980s (surely you remember the legions of generic-looking, talentless young actors whose only job was to absorb the axe-blows and machete-thrusts of cinematic psychopaths? Well, several of `em are in this flick.) Taken all in all, however, PUMPKINHEAD has a lot to offer. It's a thoughtful horror movie, and that alone is worth the price of admission.",1318982400,3,3294,4.9422382671480145

""Pumpkinhead"" is NOT one of these.

The late Stan Winston, taking a turn at the director's chair, turned out a visually memorable and psychologically visceral tale that punches so many buttons in your head, I'm still shocked it was not more of a mainstream hit.  It's a highly original and genuinely suspenseful take on the old standby of revenge, well-written and well-acted...worthy of a much greater share of reknown than it enjoys outside of the circle of us horror-junkies.

I've noticed a lot of reviewers on here mention the ""gothic"" aspects of this film, and I am encouraged by that; that's EXACTLY the word I would use to describe it, in spite of it's rural, somewhat backwoods American setting.  To acknowledge the fact that there are mysterious and often dark legends attached to cultures other than Victorian London or turn-of-the century Germany is a refreshing touch...and WHAT a touch! The theme is almost Lovecraftian; the story is filled with gut-punches, moments that strike close to home and really make us feel what the characters are feeling...

...and at times, you really wonder whose side you're on as the tale plays out.  THIS factor really struck me during my screening...you learn something about yourself if you watch it with an open mind and really consider what is transpiring.

Lance Henriksen's performance is superb, with the right amount of angst and earthiness to be believed, but never over-the-top.  The visuals of the film are haunting and eerie; nightmarish landscapes and snapshots of terror that will linger in your memory.

I believe, as I said, that this film should have gotten far more praise, and should be placed high in the rankings of horror films for it's different approach, it's visuals, and it's underlying moral.

For the money, order two copies...",1286409600,3,2037,4.941348973607038

I must say the witch in this movie is probally the most effective and genuinley frightening i have ever seen. The backwoods setting is a perfect setting for a monster that stalks its victims in the darkness. Pumpkinhead is a pretty well done monster i hate the fact the a lot of horror movies today are nothing but cgi characters. And the story is good.

The scene where we can see from the light behind her to under thin long hair with wrinkled scalp is a pure bone chiller. And her evil voice just shows how good Hollywood can be when they get it right.

2.5 Stars.

Before I start knocking this movie down a few notches, I'll tell about the good side of the movie.

1. Has a cute kid in it, but unfortunately his role was short.
2. The main actor, Lance Henriksen, is a pretty decent actor!
3. The movie's monster was pretty decent, of course the monster was moving slowly through most of it so...
4. Entertaining somewhat, not a big waste of time, watchable.
5. Understandable plot, somewhat interesting.

CONS

1. HORRIFIC acting, sorry, but anyone that tells you this movie had good acting must be choking on something stupid. Moments with drama and whatnot were just pathetic. There was only 2 or so decent main actors, the rest were just plain mediocre to bad.

2. Bizarre and unconvincing change in characteristics in terms of the farm boy that introduced the main character to the old woman. Going from an incompetent jerk to an emotional, thoughtful, helpful heroine is just...weird. If you've watched the movie, you should know. Usually if you want to do that, you'll want to give that character a gradual change throughout the movie, not BOOM ""now I care for people!"" kinda crap.

3. Extremely typical setting and plot overall. Ever watched horror movies that deal with stupid teenagers with stupidity as their main hormones? YEP! That's what this is about. You can guess what also happens to them.....horror movie meets stupid teenagers, you guess it.

So why is it getting 5 stars? Maybe because it was probably 4-5 stars a long time ago. Compare to how it is now, it is still entertaining and watchable, but it is in no way a good horror movie with decent acting. The killing scenes are just alright and there was not enough satisfying creator action or suspense leading to it. There are some, wish there was more.",1284595200,,1966,4.865269461077844

143063,5,0792836685,"In 1988 the horror world was graced with an amazing creature known as Pumpkinhead. It was introduced at a great time by offering a different type of scare in a world dominated by the slasher flick. However among film critics the movie wasn't well received as they called it senseless. In my humble opinion the critics were way wrong on this one because this film is great. It has a great plot, a true revenge motive, and one of the most horrific creatures to ever grace the horror scene.

The story is based around a local Nevada man Ed Harley and his son as they run a small isolated mom & pop shop. One day they are visited by 6 teens who are on their way to a cabin. While Harley has to run out he leaves his son behind to watch the shop and winds up being killed. It was an accident as one of the teens took him out while doing motorcycle tricks. Once Harley returns he finds his dead son and visits  a recluse who vows to resurrect Pumpkinhead to exact revenge. The only issue is once Pumpkinhead is unleashed it is very hard to put an end to the chaos.

This film truly is a 5 star effort in every sense. It just has a great feel to it. The storyline keeps you very interested which is few and far between in most horror films. Also the Pumpkinhead character looks great considering the time it was released. I see lower budget films out there now that can't even compare. This one is a must for horror fans and promises to offer something a bit different.",1246752000,,1462,4.232974910394265

143079,5,0792836685,"While I wrote a review for this film back in 2008 here on amazon, it wasn't for this exact title, the new blu-ray edition being released by Scream Factory. If you've been reading what I write for some time now, note this is for that version. I've since deleted the original review and replaced it with this one.

I've always been a horror film fan from early on. I grew up on the classics, staying up late at night and watching monster movies on the Cleveland stations all in glorious black and white. While most kids have no idea who Karloff, Lugosi or Chaney Jr. are, for me they were the monsters of my childhood. Knowing that and remembering what a great time I had with them, I'm always excited to hear that a new monster is on the horizon. Unfortunately of late that has meant slashers and stalkers rather than monsters. Wouldn't you know one of the last great monster to come along happened in 1988. The good news is that the movie that introduced this new monster is now available on blu-ray from Shout Factory.

PUMPKINHEAD offers a new creation rather than relying on something old. If you've never seen the movie then this blu-ray edition is by far the best way to introduce yourself. Not only will you get a beautiful copy of the movie itself but it offers some killer extras that fans and non-fans alike will love and appreciate. These include a new tribute to monster creator and the director of this movie, Stan Winston; interviews with the producer and several actors; PUMPKINHEAD-UNEARTHED, a documentary on the making of the movie; a featurette about the toyline that featured the creature and more.

The story itself begins in 1957 in a backwoods area where a young Ed Harley witnesses the wrath of the legend known as Pumpkinhead, a creature called forth to exact revenge on an individual or group at the bequest of someone wronged. Years later Ed (Lance Henriksen) is grown up and living with his young son, running the local general store. An accident involving a group of young people and their motocross bikes leaves Ed's son dead and Ed determined to have his revenge.

Ed finds his way to the creepy old lady of the hills and pays what she asks to help him fulfill this wish. She warns him that the cost is deep but blinded by grief he agrees. It isn't long before the creature of vengeance is unleashed upon the earth and the group of youngsters hiding in their cabin is not safe behind closed doors. Before the end of the night Ed will have to decide if the price for his revenge is worth it. Can he decide before each of the victims is claimed by Pumpkinhead?

That might not sound terrifying but in reality this creature is fantastic. Director and special effects genius Stan Winston used practical effects to create this creature and the effort pays off hugely. It appears to be a real live creature. Keep in mind in 1988 the age of CGI monsters was not around yet. When you look at this monster it is indeed scary to look at and one that you hope never comes knocking.

The whole movie has an eerie vibe to it that seeps through each and every frame. It's not just the monster that is scary but the havoc that it unleashes as well. Not only that but the effect it all has on Ed as it begins to fulfill his wishes makes for some creepy moments as well. Rarely has a new monster been created that could cause nightmares but this time they've done it and done it well.

To say that Shout/Scream Factory has outdone themselves again is beginning to become redundant in my reviews of the product they've released. They truly get that fans want to see these great horror films in blu-ray format but not cleansed so much they don't remain faithful to the original print. Not only that, they take these movies and add to them extras that show they truly appreciate these movies rather than just toss them out there with nothing special. They've done an amazing job on this release and it only makes us, the fans, look forward to what comes next. If you love this movie buy it immediately. If you like it, buy it and learn to love it. This is a great new release and one that deserves space on your shelf.",1224115200,,4128,4.4668435013262595
143080,5,0792836685,"In the western part of America, a widowed farmer/general store owner named Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen) who's one and only son was accidently killed by six city kids who are on vacation. He seeks a special witch named Haggis helps him to avenge his son's death by summoning up a vicious and brutal demon nicknamed Pumpkinhead to kill the youths that murdered his son, but soon Ed discovers that he has a mysterious link with the monster as now he must put a stop to this horrendous beast.

An underrated cult supernatural horror tale from director and special effects artist Stan Winston is one of the 80's most original and suprising horror sleepers. The creature effects by Stan Winston studio and Tom Woodruff Jr. with Alec Gillis are just outstanding to create one of horror cinema's most original monsters. Sure some of the acting isn't good but Henriksen delivers a fine performance as the tortured soul, the story is influenced by an obscure poem and the plot maybe kind of incoherent but it's an atmospheric and scary movie that has became a cult classic over the years yet it still gets it's fans as it spawned three sequels, this was a big breath of fresh air from the slasher killathons that pleagued in the 80's.

This DVD is a very vast improvement over the original bareboned full-screened with only a trailer DVD as it has excellent picture and sound plus the film is presented in a widescreen presenation.

143081,5,0792836685,"Though horror FX meister Stan Winston's directorial debut, PUMPKINHEAD (1998), didn't attract much attention upon its initial release, it has since gained respectability and cult-status popularity, and deservedly so.  Winston's background in visual FX ensures that, as a director, he is sensitive to the importance of visuals for an effective horror film, and consequently nothing that appears on screen is unimportant or unnecessary in creating the right mood and atmosphere for PUMPKINHEAD's plot and story. Indeed, nearly every frame of the film is a rich visual feast.  And, of course, the titular demon, produced by Winston's FX studio, is one of the most visually powerful and convincing creatures put on celluloid.

Another factor that makes PUMPKINHEAD an outstanding entry in horror cinema is the performance of star Lance Henriksen.  Himself a horror and SF icon, Henriksen is a stalwart method actor who ""becomes"" the various characters that he portrays, and under the guidance of director Winston, the actor molds himself into a wholly believable inhabitant of the spooky world of this film.  The rest of the cast is also excellent, especially newcomer Cynthia Bain (as the film's ""final girl"") and Florence Schauffler (as the old witch that resurrects the titular demon), but it is Henriksen that sets the tone and leads the way.

In his book CREATURE FEATURES, author and film critic John Stanley calls PUMPKINHEAD an old-school horror morality tale in the EC Comics vein, and that's a fairly accurate interpretation.  PUMPKINHEAD tells the story of backwoods denizen Ed Harley (Henriksen) who, with the help of a haggish southern witch, resurrects an evil demon to exact revenge on the urban teens whose negligence resulted in the death of his son.  But in classic EC fashion, Harley soon learns that this method of vengeance exacts too high a price, and he eventually must make the ultimate sacrifice to set things right.

MGM's new Collector's Edition DVD marks the first time that PUMPKINHEAD has been released on home video in the film's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (anamorphic for widescreen TVs).  In addition to a beautifully pristine digital transfer of the film, the DVD offers several excellent featurettes that include behind-the-scenes footage, interviews with several of the film's stars (including Henriksen), FX secrets, and a tribute to the late, great Stan Winston.  All in all, the new DVD is well worth the price of admission, and true horror aficionados should quickly add this one to their collections.",1224028800,8,2553,5.2481572481572485
143082,5,0792836685,"PUMPKINHEAD

I have to say that this is one of my all time favorite movies ever, classic in my eyes by far regardless of what other people think. Every time I have watched this film it has been with a least one of my friends or my brother, this is one of those that is just so awesome to watch with other people eating pizza and drinking what ever pleases you. I have nothing but fond memories of this movie and at least once a year we all sit down and watch this, a few other films share this distinction. I don't know if it is the pure 80's feel of this movie or maybe it is Lance Henriksen or even the excellent Pumpkinhead himself, but this is truly a fun movie.

The story is all about a loving father out in the country who owns and runs a little general store and leaves his son to watch the shop for a little bit. It is during this time he is away that the little boy runs out into a field were some city kids are racing around on their dirt bikes, when he tries to catch his dog one of the riders collides with the boy. This of course is what sets the father out on a quest for vengeance and that quest brings him to a witch in the woods that shows him the way to his vengeful choice. It is here that Pumpkinhead is called upon to bring justice to these woods and kill all of those who were involved with the killing of his kid. Of course this starts a night full of terror for these young people who really in my mind deserve what they get, well maybe not all but one in particular.

Lance Henriksen really brings this film to life with his brilliant performance, the rage of the character really comes through in a silent way. Lance's facial expressions alone make his character come to life, a very powerful performance especially for a low budget b movie. He seems haunted and tormented throughout the entire film even after he helps take out the monster. Florence Schauffler is perfect has Haggis the witch in the woods and the keeper of the demon. Much like Lance you can really feel her performance and never disbelieve the character. I remember when I was younger she kinda scared me a little because of not only the look of the character but also because of how she talked, her voice for this character is great. Of course not every performance is what I would call award winning but there is not really a bad one in the bunch. All of the people who played the helpless victims while not great did well enough to make it seem believable. The one guy in particular who was the one who actually hit the kid is really believable as a jerk, I couldn't wait for Pumpkinhead to get him.

Special effects wizard Stan Winston really crafted a wonderful directorial debut, no wonder Pumpkinhead looked so cool with this guy at the helm. Gary Gerani, and Mark Patrick Carducci did a nice job with screenplay off of producer Richard Weinman, director Stan Winston, and Mark's original screenplay. Of course this film would never have been with out Ed Justin's poem. So all of these people together brought us this wonderful viewing experience. Of course without an excellent movie monster this would just be another movie, enter Pumpkinhead. This has got to be one of the coolest monsters I have ever seen in cinematic history, and he also has a cool purpose in this movie. He is just the demon of vengeance who takes the soul of who ever called him back to hell with him after he carries out their mission. This thing actually looks like a demon to me, some of these other movies about demons really don't feel right to me.

I really believe that this is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen, the sequels that followed never really were up to par with this one in my opinion but those are reviews for another day.",1222819200,2,3737,4.332857142857143
143083,5,0792836685,"We went back to the B well once again this week with 1988's Pumpkinhead. The film was actually completed in 1987, putting it right in the middle of the Golden Era of horror B. We vaguely remember this one from our youth, and upon learning that it's original production company went belly-up before the film's release, we were absolutely excited about the project. We reviewed the sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pumpkinhead-2-Blood-Wings/dp/B000A6T1ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pumpkinhead 2 - Blood Wings</a>, a few weeks ago. While the sequel failed miserably as a legitamate horror flick, it excelled in the world of unintentional comedy that Sid appreciates so much. So going into the Pumpkinhead viewing, we were hopeful that the movie would be good enough to satisfy a horror jones, and bad enough to satisfy an unquenchable B/unintentional comedy jones. This is not an easy task, but Pumpkinhead delivered.

 The movie starts off with a farmer/country store owner named Ed Harley being a doting dad to his young son, Billy, who is a dead ringer for the the kid in Jerry Maguire. Later, the father and son go to their store for their day's work. Some young hotshots from the city(cityfolk) stop at the store on their way to a Crystal Lake ripoff for the weekend. At the same time, a hick family consisting of a middle-aged man named Mr. Wallace and his 85 kids and grandkids stop at the store as well. Ed Harley forgets to bring Mr. Wallace's feed to the store from home, so he has to go back to the house and leaves his 7 year old in charge of the store with a bunch of rednecks and rowdy 20-somethings roaming around. Great judgment there. For some reason, the out-of-towners decide to ride the hills near the store on their dirt bikes. The noise sends the Harleys' dog chasing after the bikes in a frenzy, with the kid following. Naturally, the kid gets killed after being barely brushed by a dirt bike. The dirt bikers flee the scene immediately. You could see that coming from a mile away. Ed is obviously crushed by the loss of his son and he wants revenge and his boy back. So he attempts to employ the help of an old nearby witch via Mr. Wallace. Upon seeing the dead boy in Ed's truck, Mr. Wallace asks, ""What killed him?"" To this, Ed replied, naturally, ""Cityfolk."" Just priceless. One of the highlights of the film, really.

 Ed Harley is eventually brought to the witch by a Wallace kid. She takes some blood from Billy and Ed and instructs Ed to dig up a body buried in a pumpkin patch. Ed brings the body back to the witch and she does some black magic, midnight, evil stuff. The result is Pumpkinhead. Even though the rest of the film is shot, like a true B horror, in daylight through a blue filter to make it look like nighttime, they did a great job with the Pumpkinhead creature. This thing was awesome looking, especially for more than 20 years ago. Pumpkinhead is a 10 foot tall skeleton with a tail and wing-like appendages. He also has a dinosaur shaped huge head. In short, if you saw this thing coming at you, you'd probably pee on yourself in hopes he would pass you by.

 Pumpkinhead is set in motion by the witch to exact revenge on the cityfolk for Billy Harley's death. If you don't get in Pumpkinhead's way, you're all right. If you do decide to get in his way or attempt to help one of his potential victims--not good times. Bad times. He'll probably kill you in a really cool way, like when he ran the Fonz through with the barrel of the shotgun. Even if it was obviously a rubber prop shotgun, it was still awesome. Everytime Pumpkinhead rubbed someone out, Ed Harley would feel it. In fact, Pumpkinhead started to look like Ed as the film wore on and the killings piled up. Sid is going to give the ending away, so beware. At the end of the film, Ed had no hope of his son being brought back and he wanted the Pumpkinhead reign of terror to stop. So, he instructed one of the female cityfolk kill him after realizing that this will also kill Pumpkinhead. What he wasn't banking on, however, was that he would be buried in place of the old Pumpkinhead. So, this means that he would be the next incarnation of the terrifying creature. Personally, Sid thinks that's pretty cool.

 Pumpkinhead was your typical 80's horror flick. It was part creature film rip-off, part Friday the 13th ripoff. In fact, the house that the kids stayed in was the same one used for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Maybe we will review that one at some point. But, meanwhile, Pumpkinhead was a huge winner by our calculations. It had enough real horror elements(awesome creature, people you wanted to get iced getting iced in cool ways, sweet concept) to keep you interested, but enough unintentional comedy(the cityfolk line, the hicks, awful acting, poor quality) to keep you laughing. This one is highly recommended by us, Sid the Elf, it's right up our alley. Pick it up and enjoy, but be careful of those Cityfolk.",1222041600,5,4992,4.6647727272727275
143084,4,0792836685,"I've always been a fan of this movie ever since I first saw it years ago. Unfortuantely, it looked like it was a forgotten gem among the slasher craze of the 80's. This underrated gem didn't see any love for it's first DVD, so I was really excited to see that it was finally getting the special edition that it deserves.

The movie itself is a great atmospheric monster flick. Pumpkinhead looks incredibly life-like. The monster FX are amazing, especially considering its age. The cinematography is another plus. The colors used in specific parts really enhance the creepy mood Winston set out to create, as does the music. There is a little bad acting and writing, and the ending is a little anti-climatic, but overall it's a great horror flicks with a nice, creepy atmosphere that makes it perfect to watch around Halloween.

The extras were one of the main attractions here, and they deliver. The ""Pumpkinhead Unearthed"" 6 part documentary is what the fans are looking for. They run a little over an hour together and have some nice interviews with the cast and crew on specific parts of production. It would have been nice to get more them in the interviews, but it was good enough. The ""demonic toys"" featurette is just a little interview with the guy who sculpted the Pumpkinhead figures. Nothing real exciting there. The ""BTS footage"" is pretty cool, but way too short. The ""still gallery"" has some really nice BTS set pics. Also, I don't know if this is a new film transfer or not, but it looks gorgeous playing on my Sony Upconverting DVD player and Bravia HDTV. The only real problem I have is the audio, which is barely enhanced for surround sound.

Overall, it's a great release for a real forgotten gem. The features are a little lacking, but it's good enough and great to see Pumpkinhead get the treatment he deserves.",1221696000,3,1832,4.683229813664596
143085,5,0792836685,"It has been a long time coming but I finally got to watch the Pumpkinhead Collector's Edition.  I am very glad I ordered early from Amazon because I have not seen it in any stores and now see it is out of stock.  If you are a Pumpkinhead fanatic like me I suggest you try to track down a copy of this DVD, it truly does satisfy us collector's who have been longing for such an edition for many years.
The special features go into alot of detail on the making of the film starting with the writers and producers and going through the cast, monster crew and even a nice bit on the production designer.  Most of the cast show up in recent interviews talking fondly about thier memories of the shoot.  There is also some cool footage shot behind the scenes of the construction of the monster suit, for me this alone was worth the price of the DVD.
The part on the SOTA Toys figure seems kinda out of place because there are many other figures and model kits that could have been mentioned as well.  The still gallery has some very cool images but uses alot that are easily found on the web, some story board artwork would have been nice.  The Stan Winston tribute is good but seems somewhat tacked on at the last minute, obviously due to his passing while this edition was being produced.
And that is really the only problem I have with this Collector's Edition that they waited until it was too late to include a Stan Winston interview and commentary track.  A commentary track with Stan and Lance Henriksen is such an obvious demand from a Pumpkinhead Collector's Edition that to not have one is very hard to ignore.",1221436800,3,1614,4.377926421404682

A little while back I decided to give this cult classic a shot. I had seen it advertised on Sci-Fi a bunch and it's always brought up as an underrated piece of awesomeness. Plus Lance Henrikson, so that pretty much sold me on it right there. The plot is so different from anything I've ever seen. Henrikson is great, but the best thing about it is Pumpkinhead himself. This movie was made in the late 80s, with an obviously small budget, but MAN! does PH look fantastic! I was blown away by how good the monster looked! I was totally expecting him to look like garbage, but man was I wrong! there's one scene where PH is in full view, he's huge and he takes a step forward and grabs the guy by the throat with those freaky hands of his. It's looks seemless and not-at-all stop-motiony or bouncy (like so many monster suits can look, like when they walk their feet tend to bounce just an eensy bit cause it's rubber). I was really impressed and happily surprised at how good it was. Great flick, and now a special edition? I am all over that.",1218844800,4,1222,5.054455445544554

There does not seem to be a definitive source available on the internet, but many believe the film was shot full-frame and then matted off when shown theatrically.  If this is true, then this latest DVD does indeed approximate the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  The old 'full frame' version of the movie, however, will show you the extra imagery at the top and bottom of the now-matted frame.  I don't think we're losing anything.  In fact, this new edition is so much more clean, crisp and vibrant than the old disc, it will blow your mind.",1215388800,22,1020,5.011904761904762

143090,3,0792836685,"Pumpkinhead is your typical story of revenge gone wrong when a small town grocery owner goes after a group of ""city folk"" who inadvertantly kill his son.  I like this movie, it's got some fantastic setpieces and really nice atmosphere thoughout, but I find it far from the 5 star masterpiece that many on here would like you to believe it is.  This was special effects guru Sam Winstons (Terminator 2, Aliens) first time in the directors chair (his only other being the train wreck known as ""A Gnome Named Gnorm"") and for the things I mentioned above that he got right, just about everything else is sub par... this basically watches like a really good made-for-TV movie.  The acting, dialogue, scares, plot, music, and incredibly minimal amount of bloodshed just aren't quite right for it to be a genre classic or the franchise that companies have been trying (and failing) to make it for years now.  There are two elements of the movie that do make this worthy of viewing though.  The first is Pumpkinhead himself, Stan did what he does best here (remember when watching that this is 1988!)and created a really cool looking movie monster that you can't take your eyes off of when he rears his head (not to mention the best witch EVER as a bonus).  The bad thing about the Pumpkinhead creature is that it's all design over style, meaning that he looks great but the only way he ever kills is by throwing victims over and over again or by picking them up by their necks (which both are done so that you only see the monsters arm in the scene, so I'm guessing that it was too hard to get full screen shots looking right and it's probably for the best that they didn't try).  The second thing that the film get's right is casting Lance Henriksen.  He's one of those actors that just seems to never suck... no matter how good or bad the material he's working with is.  So I like Pumpkinhead, but it's nothing overly spectacular and defiantely not a 5 star masterpiece (let's save those for The Exorcist, TCM, Psycho, The Shining,  etc.).",1192406400,4,2034,4.5479452054794525

Unfortunately, the wait continues.  I'm hoping that somewhere down the line a special edition of this movie is released in anamorphic widescreen with a digital remastering.  The movie studio entirely dropped the ball releasing it in just a horrendous pan & scan format.  Granted, the movie was not a box office smash, but even a cult classic such as this deserves better.  Hopefully with the advent of the Blu-Ray format (which parent company Sony exclusively uses) Pumpkinhead will get the treatment it so richly deserves for being a horror classic. Even more surprising is that I've seen it released in stores again in time for Halloween with a lenticular slipcase that actually looks very good.

And anyone who has seen this movie can't help but carry the vision of Haggis in their memory. And Stan Winston, well, what more do you have to know. He is one of the best.

Its got a very creepy backwaters feeling to it, and the monster, Witch, and just basic settings of the movie are great.

The plot is simple, which isn't such a bad thing. People wrong a loving father by killing his only son, father goes to local witch (very creepy) who summons a vengance deamon (the locals call pumkinhead), pumkinhead proceeds to seek vengance the only way deamons know how... terror, and death.

143125,4,0792836685,"Pumpkinhead is  one of those horror movies that didn't get much attention in the theater but took on a second life in video and on TV. It stars  Lance Henrickson  (the poor man's Christopher Walken) and he gives what may be the greatest performance of his life as Ed Harley. Ed is a storekeeper in a tiny little town way up in the backwoods. Ed is a good man-- and that's important for what comes later. He's a gentle, soft spoken man who lost his beloved wife and now has one thing that he lives for, his darling only child, Billy. Well, along come some teenagers (who all look about 25 to 30) from the city who are out riding their dirt bikes and one of them accidentally kills the little boy. The others are horrified and want to do something but the killer talks them into just leaving little Billy and running.

Big mistake oh city folks. Very soon the hit and run will be the least of your problems.

When Ed finds his dead child he snaps. Lance Henrickson is so good you can actually see the minute the light dies in his eyes and he turns to cold rage.  Going to the sheriff is not enough. Rich city folks have gotten away with crimes before. Ed decides that he needs Pumpkinhead a lengedary revenge demon who punishes murderers. Although his neighbors try to disuade him, Ed heads for the local witch who conjures up the foul demon. The witch is played very well. She's not just some old lady who lights candles and says a few love spells. This hag is clearly an agent of the devil.

 Driving home after meeting with the witch Ed has a stunning vision. He sees his son Billy sit up, alive again and the child asks in a horrified whisper, ""Dad, what did you DO?""

This might be the the most important scene in the whole movie. That's the first time when Ed realizes  that conjuring up Pumpkinhead comes with a huge price. Pumpkinhead has a mental connection with the person who calls him so Ed gets to feel and ""see"" the grisly kilings that ensue. Ed Harley is a good man. Just as his neighbors warned, the way Pumpkinhead does things is too much for Ed to bear and he decides  to call the demon off.  I won't get into the rest of the movie because things go downhill from here.  The movie sags rather badly whenever  Lance Henrickson isn't onscreen and the actors playing the city teens are dreadful. Still, it is worth buying and is a lot of fun on a Saturday night.",1140134400,2,2375,4.307865168539326

143127,4,0792836685,"This movie has all the right clich&eacute;'s in all the right places, and seems destined to be a run-of-the-mill B-flick.  However, two things set this movie apart that begins as a stereotypical horror film.  First and foremost is Pumpkinhead himself.  This delicious monster not only runs about relentlessly killing, destroying and maiming, but it has an incredibly sinister and evil grin while doing it.  I would not want a Pumpkinhead coming after me.  Second is Lance Henriksen in one of his best performances.  Henriksen had me believing in the character of Ed Harley.

This movie begins innocuously enough.  We have the usual teenage crowd running dirt bikes up and down hills, somewhere it what seems to be hillbilly country.  The next thing you know, run of the dirt bikes runs over Billy Harley (Matthew Hurley).  This movie immediately departs from the usual B-movie plot in that some of the teenagers want to help Billy.  However, regardless of their remorse and their desire to help, Ed Harley (Henriksen) wants those teenagers to pay.

Ed heads up to the hills to visit Haggis (Florence Schauffler), an old witch with evil POWER.  Returning to the typical horror genre, Ed has to go out and dig up something for the witch.  The witch turns the something into Pumpkinhead.  A purist would argue that many of the teens did not deserve to be chased down by Pumpkinhead, but it is that excess that eventually makes Ed rue the evil that he has unleashed upon the world.  I will leave the remainder of the surprises to the viewer.

This movie is a great one for stormy nights, a darkened room, and if you have the stomach for it, a bowl of popcorn.  While there are only a few places where you might actually jump, much of the movie is intended to keep you in anticipation.  A nice touch is some of Pumpkinhead's facial expression.  Who ever knew that an evil creature like Pumpkinhead could have human-like facial expressions?  I also enjoyed a couple of digs that the movie gives to traditional horror movie props, for example what happens in the church (which I will leave you to find out).

""Pumpkinhead"" is a standout from the crowd of low-budget horror films.  The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, USA nominated this movie for three awards.  While the acting of the teens is typical, Lance Henriksen's performance is excellent.  I think it is unfortunate that this movie received less attention than it has because it is a gem that belongs in any horror movie fan's collection.",1130544000,2,2511,4.783720930232558

I was sent the old cover art with Lance Henrikson, the star, on the cover with a small shot of Pumpkinhead in the background.  Very disappointing since I already owned that copy.  The new photo makes one believe that it is a new edition with possible extras not on the previous copy.  It would have been nice to get the actual cover art that appears above.

143130,4,0792836685,"One might dismiss a movie like ""Pumpkinhead"" as an example of a low budget, low quality spooker that is so common in the horror genre.  But this movie is a pleasant surprise.  Thanks to an interesting premise and a well-used creepy and atmospheric setting, there is a lot to enjoy about this film for fans of 80's horror films.

What really sets this film ahead of most of the pack are the two main stars- Lance Hendricksen and Pumpkinhead.  Mr. Hendricksen's performance is at the core of the story, and he does a great job.  From being a loving father, to being a backwoods store keeper, to being an angry man bent on revenge, etc., he give the film life through his performance and screen presence.  I imagine he would be a great person to tell stories around a campfire.

Pumpkinhead also is an extraordinary character.  He is scary, creepy, and vengeful, which is to be expected.  But he also shows a bit of personality as he goes about doing his business.  Cudos to the designers and operators of this creature.  They went a step beyond what is normally a part of these creatures.

All in all, this is not a perfect film, but it is much better than you probably would expect if you haven't seen it before.  Enjoy!",1128038400,3,1219,4.486363636363636
143131,5,0792836685,"""Pumpkinhead"" is, indeed, a very rare find; a watertight old-school thriller that delivers in spades. It is a movie that takes the worn out premise of a teenage-stalking killer and shapes it into something everyone can appreciate. The story, while certainly nothing new, does an exceptional job of maintaining the viewer's interest. Infusing the screenplay with characters we invest in and actually care for is what really sets this film apart from all the others.

Lance Henriksen delivers yet another strong performance in the long line of intriguing roles he has taken on throughout his career. He gives Ed Harley the type of sensibility that we, as viewers, see so little of in this specific genre. And that is mostly what aids in making the situation he is thrown into all the more harrowing and believable.

I must say, too, the cinematography and spectacular use of atmosphere suit the proceedings here very well. You cannot help but feel a mounting sense of dread as our protagonists struggle through the fog-infested swamps and dense wood thickets, as Stan Winston's impressively conceived creature that bears the movie's title relentlessly pursues. This was, if I am not mistaken, Winston's directorial debut. Many had doubts as to whether he, a highly regarded special effects maestro, would have the proper credentials to successfully pull off material like this. I caught the film many years ago at a pre-release screening, and I was immediately sold! Anybody who has ever enjoyed a good old fashioned monster movie with better than average production values and acting should definitely be satisfied with what this film brings to the table. It curiously never saw a theatrical release, and I find that especially sad. Several articles I had read at the time claimed the film had been tossed back and forth between two or three different distributors, many of whom were at odds over how the movie should be marketed. MGM finally landed a deal with Winston for a release, but it came too little too late and the film went straight to video. That's a crying shame, too, because I feel this would have easily raked in the theatrical dough.

I would highly recommend this title for purchase. It really is many notches above what one might expect.",1127865600,9,2255,4.9603174603174605

143133,5,0792836685,"The creature (and movie) known as ""Pumpkinhead"" was originally named Vengeance: The Demon. But, instead, we were given the name of the monster in the folk stories it evolved from. (in all actuality, it was based on a poem written by Ed Justin)

Pumpkinhead is a monster film of...well, monstrous proportions. This is not your grandpa's Dracula, Wolf Man, or Creature From The Black Lagoon sequel (although I do enjoy the older films, don't get me wrong). Here, you are invited into the small-town world of Ed Harley -- a loving father with a simple, country life out in the middle of what appears to be nothing more than an isolated dessert land with some mountains and woods. He and his young son Billy are carrying out the daily routine at their old-fashioned grocery store they run for the locals, when a group of ""city folk"" come roaring in with their sports car and dirt bikes. The flat and sandy land appears to be the perfect spot to do some biking on. But when Ed leaves the area for just a moment, one of the young men from the city accidently hits Billy with his bike coming down from a jump. Ed returns to find half of the teens gone and Billy lying on the ground. Although the remaining teens who didn't flee from the scene insist it was only accidental, Harley is furious. Before long, his son dies. Hungry for a taste of bittersweet revenge, he tracks down an old witch in the middle of the woods known as Haggis. Ed remembers that as a child he witnessed in the shadows of the night a fierce creature named Pumpkinhead kill a man. As legend has it, if one man commits a horrible act -- usually murder -- then a loved one of the victim can have Pumpkinhead conjured up to take revenge. This is what Harley has come for. And although the witch warns him of the mysterious ""price"" he must later pay, the grieving father fetches the small body of the creature from the pumpkin patch in an old graveyard for her, so she can bring life to the beast. After a spell, the demon sprouts into a nine-foot-tall monster (approximate height, of course). It proceeds to hunt down the teens one by one and brutally slaughter them. Ed realizes what he has done is too harsh. He wanted revenge, but not THIS. Regardless, the deal is unbreakable and Haggis cannot stop the demon. So, Harley attempts to stop it himself. And once he begins the battle, the ""price"" is revealed and a costly decision must be made.

This is one hell of a horror flick. Luckily, nudity was left out and the gore wasn't too overbearing (the R rating is basically for violence and some language). Besides the talents of the actors (especially Lance Henriksen as Ed Harley), Pumpkinhead is mainly impressive and worth more than one viewing for it's monster. The costume is wonderful. Combined with the right cinematography, sets, lighting, and editing, it becomes very realistic. The plot is kept mostly simple and to-the-point. The story of Vengeance The Demon and the way it is presented in this film is worth every cent. Not to mention, we are treated to that nice little twist at the end of the film.

Ed Harley (Lance ""Near Dark"" Henriksen) runs a little side-of-the-road grocery store with his beloved son Billy. One day, a group of city folks stop by on their way to a cabin in the mountains. They're just some kids out for a fun-filled vacation of dirt-biking etc. Unfortunately, one of them runs over Billy while practicing in a field near the store. Ed is away, and must find out when he returns that his only son is dead. The whole thing was an accident, but Ed is blinded by sorrow and rage and wants revenge for the injustice. He remembers an old woman in the woods who can call forth a demon named Pumpkinhead from an old, forgotten graveyard. Ed finds her and pays the price for her services, unleashing the creature by digging up a long-dead corpse, carrying it back to the old woman's hovel and adding his (and his son's) blood to it. Next comes the monster's rampage, where it systematically kills off the kids who did Ed Harley wrong. Now, that would make for a good monster flick right there, right? Well, Ed Harley soon finds out the true price for revenge when he begins seeing / feeling / experiencing the murders through the demon's eyes, ears, and claws! He gets to the point where he can't take anymore and intercedes on the surviving kids' behalf. PUMPKINHEAD is a dark, horror-filled morality play, with plenty of forboding atmosphere and nothing preachy / teachy about it's potent message. We get the idea without being hit over the head with it! Of course, PUMPKINHEAD is equally enjoyable as a good ol' fashioned beasty bash, with no underlying message at all.

And I must say I'm pretty damn glad I did. Pumpkinhead is a highly original, innovative, imagitive, exciting film. While watching it a couple of saturday nights ago I was more captivated, interested and caught up in the story. And after watching it a couple more times, now I'm more into it as being one of my favourite films. Lance Henriksen gives a captavating performance as Ed Harley. He plays the role superbly. He plays he scenes well with his son- the soft fatherly side, and can tap into the rage quite easierly. I love the first scene of the farmer banging on Ed's fathers door for help because Pumpkinhead's gonna get him- the settings can be dark and compelling, and other times they can be warm and loving like with his son. I recommend this film for anyone curious about it, if your a horror movie buff this should forfill some needs. It's not bloody and gory, but it works in other ways- it doesn't need all gore to be excellent, and Stan Winston shows this well and proves himself for his first directional effort.

Most just go the camp route, but Pumpkinhead is a GOOD movie.  No, it's not gonna win any awards, but it's a very solid effort on Stan Winston's part.  If the Brothers Grimm were alive today and dabbled in film, this is probably the movie they would have made;  It has that whole Grimm fairy tale-like story and look to it, not to mention a great looking monster.  Lance Henriksen(another fantastic underrated actor) does a wonderful job playing Ed.  The scene where his son dies is actually very sad, and in a movie like Pumpkinhead you wouldn't expect anything  that emotional. But like I said, this film stands out amongst other films in the low budget horror category.  This film may seem kinda silly when you compare it to Citizen Kane or Vertigo, but in it's own class it rivals the best of the genre.",1051142400,2,950,4.445086705202312
143144,4,0792836685,"Pumpkinhead is a beast brought to life when the justice of men is not enough.  Lance Henriksen (star of Aliens, Near Dark, and TV's Millenium among MANY others) stars as Ed Harley, a single father (we are to asume a widower) living in a deeply rural area and running the only general store for the mountain people of the area.
Mr. Harley lives a hard life.  His only ray of sunshine is his young son.  A group of young people (a traditional group of 1980's bandana-wearing twnetysomethings) stops by his store on their way to a mountain-biking getaway.  An accident happens and Ed's ray of sunshine is snuffed out.
This is where we get to the meat of the movie.  We are shown that, as a young boy, Ed witnessed a creature of local folklore hunt down and finish off an accused murderer.  The children of the area call the creature ""Pumpkinhead"".
Now, distraught over the loss of his child by some ""city folk"" who ran from the scene of the ""crime"", Ed sets out to summon Pumpkinhead and have the creature take vengeance in his name.
I think we all might at the very least CONSIDER doing what Ed does, that is IF the same thing happened to us.  The message of the film is that we shouldn't.  Ed realizes that, and tries to stop Pumpkinhead after he sets this juggernaut in motion.
The film is directed (and directed WELL I might add) by Special Effects guru Stan Winston.  Winston is behind such incredible monsters as the creatures of Aliens and Jurassic Park.
Pumpkinhead appealed to me because I like gloomy, mythic, vengeamce stories.  Ed Harley takes a journey through a rainbow of emotions and Lance Henriksen handles them all superbly.  He really is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors.
The twentysomething ""city folk"" actors are nothing special, but they do not need to be.  Lance Henriksen, Pumpkinhead, and the fantastically evil, cackling witch who summons him carry this movie on their shoulders.  they take us to a place where you can't call the police.  A place where if someone wrongs you,  you can take deadly retribution on them, and your victims will never be missed.
Pumpkinhead is a great Halloween movie,  but it will fit nicely into any dark, rainy Saturday night.  The movie loses one star for the generic post-teenage characters and for the annoying streaming blue light and strob effects that seem out of place in night time scenes.",1037404800,7,2360,4.675544794188862

He's perfectly cast as the father of a young boy accidentally killed by four teenagers with their careless attitudes and speeding motorcycles.  Set in the Ozarks, one of the great purely American milieus, the film has Henriksen's character seek a terrible revenge on the teenagers in the form of the titular creature, who's conjured up by a witchy woman solely for the sake of vengeful justice.
This movie is the work of Stan Winston, the famous special effects guy, who designed and built the creature AND directed the film.  Winston wastes nothing here; he's extremely effective in his direction and the monster is a serious frightener. The emergence, every appearance, and the slaughter wrought by the thing are all well done, and that's because atmosphere is paramount in this flick.
There's a great blend here of rural life, mountain ways, myth and legend, and down-to-the-bone nastiness.  The combining of these elements all bring Pumpkinhead to a ferocious boil that makes this a terrific horror movie, one of the best in the American canon.  Highly recommended.

I was disappointed in the fact that the movie could've been better than it was. The movie is about a hillbilly father and son living in some deserted dusty place that looks like an abandoned town. The movie starts by showing us what a close relationship the father and his little son have. Then a bunch of teens led by an arrogant kid drive their dirt bikes over the son and kill him. The father distraught by the death seeks out a demon called Pumpkinhead (that he remembers seeing from his childhood) to seek revenge on the teens. After some searching the father finds an old witch who can conjure up Pumpkinhead. Pumpkinhead comes to life and begins killing the teens. The problem is that the father becomes a ""part"" of Pumpkinhead. That is he can see the murders being committed by Pumpkin. So the father changes his mind about seeking revenge and he tries to stop Pumpkin. My problem with the film is that it could've been a cool revenge film like Carrie but instead it turns into another monster film. The monster effects are ok, but this film had the potential to be so much better. ...",1033516800,,1263,4.378723404255319
143147,5,0792836685,"Sometimes revenge merits reaction, the depth of which seemingly hinged upon how badly the wronged party is slighted.  In Ed Harley's (Lance Hendrikson - Aliens) case, the end to satisfy his pressing need goes well beyond even the strangest ways of ""getting even."" After a few moments of movie affirmation dealing with how much he loves his son, he decides, rather unfortunately, too leave him at his country store while he goes and delivers an order. While he's away, some ""city kids"" that have just arrived decide to do a little motorbiking and accidentally kill Harley's son. Quite distraught by what has happened, he goes and sees an old witch about bringing his son back from the dead only to find out she can do nothing for him in that field. After she breaks the news to him that his child's death is irreversible, his need for revenge causes him to seek another, bleaker, path to sate his anger. Defying the legends about the cost of such dealings, Harley decides to invoke the pumpkinhead, a beast to kill all those who had wronged him. The only problem with this idea, as he soon finds pout, is that he must watch them die, one by one, as his bloodlust takes the form of a ""demon.""
Psychologically, can he deal with this or can he find a way to undue that which he has wrought? Ah, the fun of signing over all your objections when you're peeved.
Pumpkinhead is another superb outing by the masterful effects wizard Stan Winston (Aliens, T-2, Jurassic Park, She-Creature, How to Make a Monster, Earth Vs, The Spider) that brings a lot to the table. Besides a nice looking monster, you have an interesting storyline, a motive for the events taking place, some really good acting mixed with some average acting, and plenty of characters to sacrifice to the kiddy grinder.

Fast- forward to the present. While living peaceful life with his son Billy and their pooch Gyspy, a now grown Ed Harley's (Lance Henriksen) world is turned upside down when careless city folks accidentally kill his boy.
Pained by his son's death, Ed knows that simple justices will not be enough. He turns to the only avenue he knows...Pumpkinhead. Were the legends true? Did he really see this mythical beast as a child? What will the price be for vengeance??? Good questions, too bad Ed doesn't care about the consequences, he wants retribution. After striking a deal with the mountain witch Haggis (Florence Schauffler), the demon ""vengeance"" (a.k.a Pumpkinhead) is sent forth to unleash its hellish fury upon these transgressors.
As blood, body parts, and religious symbols fly, this dark executioner of the netherworld reaps vengeance on its unsuspecting prey.

Once the demon is brought to life, and goes about finding and killing the young city kids in horrible, gruesome ways, Henriksen realizes that he made a terrible mistake and tries to stop it. But, you can't. It has to run it's course. The creature itself is magnificently scary. It's scenes are directed very well and very creepily. That's something the sequel sorely lacked in.

143153,4,0792836685,"This is a great little halloween movie. Superb direction from then first-timer Stan Winston, and a truly awe-inspiring central creature in the title role. It's production problems were highly publicised at the time, what with its yo-yo title changes (Vengeance, the Demon, anyone?) to the studios flipping the movie back and forth, it seemed like this movie would remain forever in limbo. Luckily for us in the UK, it did get its release (even if it was direct-to-video). Which meant for me it was a happy sight to see it emerge in the digital format . . .  or so I thought.
Back to the film itself, the story is rather lame, highly reminiscent of the FRIDAY THE 13TH movies in the 80s, but what those movies don't have is Lance Henriksen in the lead role. He elevates this movie from what could have been usual direct-to-video dreck to cult classic status. His strong figure gives gravitas to all of the story around him, and you actually feel his emotions are played for real, as they could have so easily been trivialised in lesser hands. It is a great monument to him and director Winston for giving this movie a heart and soul, that is so lacking in many other horror movies of the day and quite considerably now. The look of the movie is great with Bojan Bazelli giving the film a dark and fairy-tale/Brothers Grim feel. Richard Stones' score is marvellous and the creature effects are spot-on (just take a look at the pedestrian effects in Pumpkinhead II to make you see what wonders they did on this show). So, all in all the movie itself is a four or five star affair. It's a pity the disc is not.
MGM have put out some wonderful discs in the past year. Their Bond 007 special editions are faultless, and they have shown a lot of respect to other movies with great DVD transfers, extras and excellent packaging. What annoys me about this particular edition that I have is that MGM have hardly put any effort into it. The disc is a bare-bones affair and is obviously a ""budget release"". No anamorphic widescreen (I assume WInston shot in scope, can anyone enlighten me if he did or didn't? It would be great to see this movie the way it was shot.), the picture quality is poor (and highly resembles my CBS/FOX VHS 1989 UK release copy) and not an extra in sight. Okay, we get the trailer, but what about a commentary track or new documentary? C'mon MGM, I am willing to shell out again for a PUMPKINHEAD special edition than have the movie in this lacklustre edition.

I would have enjoyed this alot more if I was alot younger like at age 8 or 9 because when your at that age you get to be scared when watching a horror movie but now that im grown up and an adult you don't enjoy a horror flick such as this in the same perspective as you was when a child. I do remember watching this when I was little but I don't remember that much but I do remember being so scared I couldent sleep in my bed for a week. Any ways back to the movie. I gave it 5 stars because I realy see no flaws in this exept for when the little boy billy is supposed to be dead but if you look at him in the back ground you can see him blinking,and I also thought it was a little weird when pumpkin head climbs up on top of the house and the tree,now I cant picture somthing that big and clumbsy climbing up a tree. Aside from those two things I didint see any other flaws. The acting of the charecters are great and there personalitys have lots of depth such as Ed Harly. It is also very heart breaking to see that cute little boy die and you feel very sorry for Ed after words because of the great loving relationship between him and his son. Believe it or not but there was a few city folks in the movie that I was rooting for pumpkin head to kill like the one guy who hit the kid with his motor cycle(you could tell that the bast*** didint care when he hit him but just about himself)and his girl friend because I just couldent stand the way she acted and also the guy who was the brother of the guy who hit the little kid just mainly for the fact he was helping his carless brother but the rest of them I liked and wanted them to make it through alive.

143155,4,0792836685,"My remarks toward this picture
It was approximately 1:00americium, the table was cluttered with junk food, and the television, providing the only light in the living room, was playing Stan Winston's Pumpkinhead. I was sitting on the couch watching it with one of my brother's friends, and there he was-this allegedly ""brave"" fourteen-year-old with the body of a sixteen, virtually on the verge of having a (...) heart-attack for Christ sake; he was really freaked out of his mind, and that's because Pumpkinhead has the quality of a really terrific and terrifying horror film that doesn't lack on a single thing. (Okay, maybe it could've improved a little on a couple of its death sequences, for it was quite weak in fully exposing them, but it was made in the eighties.)
Pumpkinhead, also known as Vengeance of the Demon, is based upon characters from American folklore and classic allegory, adding to its potent-unyielding terror. It is one of those rare horror films that does more than merely provide an assortment of sadistic death sequences for shock value, as so many others do in this genre, but being all that they're good for. It not only features tremendous special effects by Oscar-winner Stan Winston that center upon the most ideal monster, and performances that are beyond exceptional (most notably by our leading man, Lance Henriksen, who I think, despite of his appearance in much more highly budgeted theatrical films, delivered his finest performance in this one); in addition, it has an extraordinary intellectual and well-written, riveting plot line that make this one of the most beloved horror films of all time, with a growing fan cult following despite it being released over ten years ago.
This grim, highly evocative and compelling picture, which was critically-praised as being ""stylish and atmospheric,"" will have you frozen with fear until the very last moment! As you watch this impassive and vicious creature with ghastly appearance that can't possibly get anymore authentic than they already are, in pursue of its victims in whom it could once again take pleasure of dragging its massive claws all throughout as it previously has following several other resurrections, there is no doubt that your jaws wouldn't have dropped and eyes wouldn't have practically hung out of their sockets; it really is likely that blinking is something you may forget to do here. And it's even the littlest things that make this film so momentous, such as, prior to the demon's awakening, the part of the film where Ed Harley, emotionally-driven, attempts to journey up to the mountains where an actual witch is believed to live yet feared by all, who do not dare to enter her grounds, for they are aware of the evil force that lies within her and her abilities to turn lives of the innocence upside-down.
Having ended his journey after a little help from a curious local boy who, however, did not come along for the entire ride as surroundings began to modify into a menacing gloom, Harley steps inside an old, roach-infested cottage holding his lifeless son, and ultimately comes face-to-face with evil itself. While the witch performed upon her rituals in aim of fulfilling this man's desires, she actually makes it feel real. She truly makes you forget that you're even watching a movie. Never before have I been so affected. The acting and the direction was outstanding! If you're a horror fanatic as myself am, I would urge you to see this one.",1000339200,,3463,4.962134251290878

The monster's design was truly ideal for the setting, and Henriksen's acting almost made up for the terible acting of the teenagers. The writers made the mistake of making the city teens so dislikeable that you root for Pumpkinhead to rip them apart, one by one.

The theme of revenge, and its consequences is quite interesting, as is the father's desperate attempt to reverse the spell.  The teens in this film are obligatory amoral and heartless, making the father's attempts to save them all the more touching.

Pumpkinhead is a surprisingly brilliant horror movie that's crimnally underrated and overlooked. Pumpkinhead is everything The  Blair Witch Project should've been and much more.
Story: A Farmer named  Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen) finds out  that his son Billy (Matthew Hurley)  was accidently killed by MoterCycle riding Teens who accidently ran him  over. Though it was an accident,Ed finds a way to get Revenge.
Ed meets a  strange Old Woman who lives in a creepy Witch like  Shack and promises Ed  Revenge is what he'll get.
Ed is told to dig up the remains of a Monster  and bring it back to the Old Woman. When he does,the Monster,named  ""Pumpkinhead""  (because he was buried in an old Pumpkin  Patch,but looks  nothing like a Pumpkin) comes to life and mangles the  Teens in the area. Ed realizes that this isn't what he wanted. He also learns  he can't take it back,so he tries desperately to destroy the Beast and turn  everything normal again.
This film is absolutely fantastic and is true to  the horror genre. The photography is excellent and some of the best I've  ever seen. It's dark and quite filthy,adding lots of suspense  to the  already excellent story and settings. The story is extremely original and  refreshing,and adds a great twist to the Revenge factor found in most  films.
The performances are wonderful. Henriksen is the perfect choice  for Ed Harley. He's believeable,and the same applies to the other  characters. Their all believeable and have loads of depth, and most of them  are truly sympathetic. The dialog is also superb.
Creature Maven Stan  Winston (who created the Aliens is Aliens,  the Dinosaurs in the two  Jurassic Park films,and the Gorgonite and Commando Elite figures for Small  Soldiers) makes his directorial debut here and is surprisingly  excellent. His direction is very strong and powerful,and gives the film a  great feel to it,that also feels very hard-worked and suspensful.
The  special effects are mind blowing. There isn't a single CGI  effect is  sight. The Monster ""Pumpkinhead"" is brilliantly done and is the  true Boogyman of the horror genre. He's the Monster that gives kids  Nightmares. There is also a truly breath-taking scene where  ""Pumpkinhead"" lifts a MoterCycle with a Teen on it and throws it  without a problem.
All in all,Pumpkinhead is a simply brilliant horror  movie that very sadly doesn't get the credit it deserves. If your a horror  fan and want to see how a REAL horror movie is done,do yourself a favor and  add this Gem to your collection,along with many other classic horror films  including Phantasm,Halloween, Friday the 13th,and many more.
On a side  note...that over-hyped piece of Garbage known as  The Blair Witch Project  ripped this Masterpiece of totally. Always keep that in mind when you watch  Pumpkinhead and Blair  Witch!",967680000,12,2841,4.997854077253219
143178,5,0792836685,"Pumkinhead is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.  Not since Deliverance has a story of backwoods revenge disturbed me so.  I'm 20 years  old and after watching this I could not get to sleep.  I kept thinking,  yes, it's just a movie.  But what if I made someone angry and they sent  Pumpkinhead after me?  Strange thoughts for three in the morning, unless  you just watched this movie.
Lance Henriksen plays the loving, but  vengeful father very well, and none of the cast members come off as being  unbelievable in their roles.  The woman who played the witch was freaky as  all get out!  But Pumpkinhead, oh man, truly a denizen from the darkest  pits of Hell!  The creature deserves the status as one of the top ten film  monsters of all time.  Stan Winston's direction is superb, making good use  of eerie atmosphere and the always fun, monster related gore.  The scenes  with helpless teenagers being pursued and not being helped by people safe  in their homes were very effective.  But the best part of this movie was  seeing Pumpkinhead's sly, demonic smile just before it reached its claws  toward another victim!  This movie is essential viewing for Horror fans and  perfect for a dark, October night.  But if you watch this movie don't make  any plans for sleeping!",966211200,4,1285,4.63677130044843
143179,5,0792836685,"This is definitely one of the best horror flicks to come around for a long time. As my title reads, ""original AND scary"" ! Just think...  when this was made, they couldn't rely on computer special effects.  Everything was done by makeup, costumes and a great setting. It kind of  brings me back to the original Aliens. The creature in this movie was  strong, big, and completely without a soul... evil at the core. As far as  the cast, I've always found Lance Henriksen to be a very intense actor and  I think he proves it here. Very nice Lance, VERY nice. In short, people, I  highly recommend this movie. The creature is very real looking. It scared  the heck out of me the first time I saw it.",965001600,,696,4.341085271317829

'Pumpkinhead' is sadly underrated and ignored and often snubbed by people, and it is hard to see why as this 'revenge tale' is original and surreal.  The witch in this film, in my opinion, is scarier than the creature.

7792175,2,0792836685,"Let me be clear, my low rating is not reflective of the film itself, but rather the changes made to this version from prior versions.  For some strange reason, a lot of the blue coloring of night scenes were removed.  This makes a lot of the scenes appear tungsten with a warm coloring to them and differs greatly from the prior versions.  The movie is great, but unfortunately, there are some weird changes made that drastically change the overall atmosphere of this great film.",1514764800,,479,4.678571428571429

Although there is some graphic violence, this film does not degenerate into a slasher type movie like the Jason series.  As with most of these ""series"" movies, stick with the first one as the sequels tend to drop off in quality very rapidly.
