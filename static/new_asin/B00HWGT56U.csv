6240445,5,B00HWGT56U,"I don't currently own this but have seen it five times on TV. Each time is as good as the first time not bored with it in the least bit. It shows JFK in his whirlwind trip to Texas the last three days of his life. As for me I was 7 years old and saw JFK in San Antonio at his appearance at Brooks AFB. My Dad was stationed as a Drill Instructor at Lackland Air Force Base on the other side of San Antonio. My Dad told me not to go to school we were ""going on a special trip and see someone special"". Little did I know it was JFK. It was around 2:30 in the afternoon JFK gave a short speech we were standing out in this field about 100 yards away is my best guess. This special shows that appearance and the rest of his trip ending in Dallas. A lot of appearances by people who saw him on that trip 50 years ago including kids that were in elementary school up to his Secret Service Agents. To me the most amazing thing about this special is that each location is shown as it is nowadays and then is superimposed by how it was 50 years ago ! A must see for anyone who knows about JFK and his impact on America !!!! P.S. this will be my next purchase from Amazon !!!",1400371200,7,1164,3.8949579831932772
6240446,5,B00HWGT56U,Extremely well done.  So much more than what we have seen in the past.  Illustrates not only the last 24 hours but the real personal side of JFK.,1399420800,7,145,4.142857142857143
6240447,5,B00HWGT56U,"A poignant memorialization of President Kennedys fateful trip to Texas, this enthralling and beautiful documentary vividly captures the Kennedy mystique during the last 24 hours of his remarkable life.",1395878400,4,201,5.9655172413793105
6240448,5,B00HWGT56U,This documentary is by far this best on what happened on that Texas visit. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested not on the controversy surrounding the assassination but on the events of those two days. Excellent,1394841600,7,223,4.743589743589744
6240449,5,B00HWGT56U,It brought back memories of four days watching tv and finding unreal. the course of the US was change back to the way it was before JFK had people believing in the future and how youth could have a part in it.,1394668800,5,209,4.0
6240450,5,B00HWGT56U,Some very rare footage of JFK's final hours...some activities which were not planned and were quite spontaneous. Hard to believe he was only 46 and already leader of the free world for 3 years! There will never be another one quite like him...just look at the reaction of the crowds everywhere he went. Even when he went outside the U.S. That will never be replicated. And he was so cool under pressure...always the consummate politician/leader.,1393891200,15,445,4.946666666666666
6240451,5,B00HWGT56U,"Without question, one of the finest chronicles of that horrible period ever produced. Using newly restored film, much of it in color and not seen before, the program tells the story of JFK's last twenty-four hours. The color footage, some of which has been seen before, was stunning in its vividness and clarity. The narration was precise and the use of old footage and photography morphing into the same scene today was very interesting.",1392336000,14,438,4.9324324324324325
6240452,5,B00HWGT56U,"After watching countless shows about JFK, this is by far my very favorite one.  It shows many scenes in black and white from 1963 and then it freezes and goes to now (or vice versa).  It shows many eye witnesses, and as they are talking to you NOW.....they freeze a part of the film and you see that eye witness THEN!  It gives there name, age at the time, etc.  It shows you exactly where all the President and First Lady were those final hours, you learn so much and it is very emotional.  I highly recommend this to ALL!",1390694400,10,523,4.19
6240453,5,B00HWGT56U,Had some footage I had not seen before. Makes good addition to the other JFK assassination videos I have.  Nothing new or shocking but  good footage.  I recommend .,1454198400,,164,4.586206896551724
6240454,3,B00HWGT56U,"I've seen every JFK assassination film, and many of them cover the same well-worn ground. Not this one. It contains a treasure trove of rarely seen, beautifully preserved color film of the hours leading up to the event. However, the film and its interviewees are sickeningly obsequious in their unrelenting, North Korea-style JFK worship.",1434844800,2,338,5.277777777777778
6240455,5,B00HWGT56U,Great video of JFK and Jackie's last trip to Texas prior to the assassination. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the Kennedy era and how his death impacted America.,1423958400,,175,4.67741935483871
6240456,5,B00HWGT56U,"JFK: The Final Hours is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen of the JFK Assassination.  It is well done, with a emphasis on the touching last hours of President Kennedy's life, as opposed to the graphic nature of the assassination and conspiracy theories. It is produced and presented in a professional manner. This documentary details little known hour by hour interactions that the president had with American citizens, and the impact his life and death still have on their lives today.  I highly recommend.",1422921600,,519,4.954022988505747
6240457,5,B00HWGT56U,"Of all the documentaries I have seen of the assassination event, this is my favorite. If you love details and all the inside background information of their movements, this is the one for you.",1422835200,,192,4.676470588235294

6240462,5,B00HWGT56U,This is one of the best documentaries on the subject of JFK's last days.  Including new (at least for me) scenes that I had not seen before.  Highly recommended.,1405814400,,161,4.517241379310345
8636907,5,B00HWGT56U,"I was amazed at the sheer volume of movie footage that I had never seen before, and so  much of it in color.  Very well done.  It was especially informative regarding JFK's itinerary for his Texas trip prior to his arrival in Dallas.",1490659200,,233,4.372093023255814

8636912,5,B00HWGT56U,"About the best collection of archival film (much of it the public has never seen) of that day in Dallas that I have ever viewed.  Much of the footage is in stunning color, in contrast to much of the black-and-white commercial TV footage from November 22, 1963.  A lot of it is White House camera footage, much of which never made it into the public domain to underwrite documentaries that have been done in past decades.  It's all skillfully edited and interwoven to present a much more riveting and compelling narrative than you'll see in most documentaries.

I had never previously seen as much footage (commercial TV and amateur by-stander footage) of the motorcade leaving Love Field and proceeding into Dallas, long before the fateful moments in Dealey Plaza.  This production does an excellent job of editing almost every scrap of amateur film footage into a single, continuous narrative thread, almost as if you are witnessing the entire motorcade through downtown Dallas.  The sequences morphing today's locales into actual 1963 sites are particularly effective and well-done.

This is a superb contemporary documentary that benefits from having access to film footage unavailable in previous years, enhanced by today's digital technology that improves picture resolution from those grainy and blurry film snippets we all remember from 1963 and have re-lived continuously for more than 50 years now.",1473033600,,1407,5.226666666666667
8636913,5,B00HWGT56U,Everyone should have an opportunity to view this production!,1470700800,,60,5.777777777777778
8636914,5,B00HWGT56U,It is an excellent documentary of JFK narrated by Bill Paxton.,1462838400,,62,4.7272727272727275
8636915,5,B00HWGT56U,"This movie on JFK's final hours on earth corroborates beyond a shadow of a doubt that Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson had been connected to JFK's killing because a witness had been testifying before a committee in Washington connecting Johnson to fraud in the Department of Agriculture as JFK was being killed. As you watch the movie, watch Johnson's eyes stalking every move JFK made between November 21-22, 1963 like a fox watching his quarry and hoping that nothing would happened to have to abort the killing of JFK in Dallas, Texas, As soon as Johnson became President the committee closed the hearing, Johnson had escaped going to prison for fraud, among many other charges that Johnson would have to face had Johnson not killed President Kennedy, see ""JFK: Confession of an Assassin"" [VHS] ; ""LBJ: The Mastermind of the JFK Assassination"" by Phillip F. Nelson , p. 73, David Atlee Phillips (CIA Agent).",1462579200,,914,4.941558441558442
8636916,5,B00HWGT56U,A brilliant documentary that should be mandatory viewing for all high school students in the United States.,1455926400,,107,5.352941176470588
