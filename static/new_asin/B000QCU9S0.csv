8195790,4,B000QCU9S0,"I read some bad reviews of this video and could not figure out why.  Guess they watched another video...,anyway, this has great production values and drop dead gorgeous women.  What more could a man ask for?",1374278400,,207,4.722222222222222
8195791,2,B000QCU9S0,"Yes, the girls are beautiful and naturally so, but unfortunately this is very typical of Playboy and Penthouse videos! Much too much camera movement and little or no model movement. I guess these guys just don't know what to do with the video camera, so they pan up and down the girls' bodies and then zoom in on some part of their anatomy, then off to a tree, a seashell or a knot in a rope. Their idea of art, I guess. If only I had know it was from Playboy and/or Penthouse before I bought it!! If you want to see how to film nude women, go have a look at Lucas Helios' film of ""Iveta B"" on Met-Art's website. His models don't do anything spectacular movement-wise, but he lets them walk around and slowly undress or not! He keeps the camera at a distance that shows the entire girl most of the time.

Face it, if you are alone with your girlfriend, relaxing in the nude, you don't spend your time with your face a foot away, going up and down her body and then look off into the distance. You just watch her move around until you are stimulated enough to start touching each other, yes?",1253664000,5,1090,4.215311004784689
8195792,2,B000QCU9S0,"I'd describe the models as tall, handsome women. The setting appears to be a series of photo-shoots, and as a result the ladies are mostly acting as statues. Some of the models appear only very briefly. I can't remember much else about it.",1249084800,,239,4.5813953488372094
8195793,2,B000QCU9S0,"Look, if you are going to make something with the title ""Nude"" in it, then you should go all the way.  Cinimax or Showtime have better action at late night.",1240790400,,156,4.2
8195794,5,B000QCU9S0,"This is the best DVD of this type I've ever seen. The 14 women filmed here are natural and beautiful (natural in body and poise). The DVD appears to be a filming of photo shoots (for the magazine most likely, but there is also a slide show feature of the shoots), the models are lovely and don't try to tease or dance, just pose in a tasteful way. The editing and instrumental music is also tasteful. I am amazed there is even a market for the augmented women seen so often these days, their bodies really only look good when hidden by a bikini (men should speak up and help stop this kind of unnecessary self abuse). These ladies show how beautiful nature intended the female form to be.",1186272000,32,688,4.341085271317829
