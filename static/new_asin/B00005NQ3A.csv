It was filmed in Guinea Africa, features a young African boy who has a dream of becoming a soccer player and features his journey from his home village to being discovered.  The movie is not rated, but I can vouch for it as being rated G (ages 7 and older).  For younger children they probably cannot understand the story line.

This film is perfect for classrooms in elementary, middle or high schools...and appropriate for families.  It is in French, no subtitles, but my students have never had any problems understanding the movie because of its visual cues and beautiful direction.  This film is not widely known, especially in the USA, but should be at the top of the list of French Flim Classics.  My students beg me to either have it or ask where they can buy it, after they have seen it.  That's how great the movie is.  They also leave with wonder.  They appreciate seeing life in Guinea and they wonder where little ""Bandian"" is today.

This film is a slam-dunk!!  C'est extraordinaire !!  I have purchased it several times.  One of which was due to another teacher breaking the disc...which sent me into a panic because this film is not easy to purchase.  Why is it so difficult to find??

Be careful, though, often, depending on who is listing it on Amazon, the DVD maybe region 2 for Europe.  So, you may need a special ""region-free"" DVD player, which I use.  If you google it, you can find one.  I use a DVD player by Philips which I converted to region free because I found that there was a special code that can be used with its remote controller to change the player to region free.  Or just make sure you purchase a region free ""0"" disc or a region ""1"" that is for USA and Canada DVD players.",1412467200,,1782,4.458204334365325
7947583,4,B00005NQ3A,"This is a great movie with subtle humor that entertains in its everyday simplicity. I saw it several years ago at a film festival of some sort, but it's been so long that now I'm a bit vague on the details. A few years ago, I was finally able to track down a copy to buy, but it didn't come with subtitles and I don't know French, the language of the movie. I want to rewatch it someday so until then, I will have to keep looking...",1298160000,,432,3.9770114942528734
