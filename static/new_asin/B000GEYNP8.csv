8131268,5,B000GEYNP8,"The format is excellent. I love that you can study each moving and still posture individually.

I have practiced this wudang qigong daily for 4 months and it has brought about a degree of internal calm and silence that i have never had before. And, i have been preformimg other various qigong for the past 15 years.

I think if you have already done some internal work you will quickly feel the energy moving with this qigong set of exercises. The benefits are outstanding.

If you are just starting out, it would be wise to learn some qigong/tai chi posture basics as this will speed up the learning process.

Everyones experience with internal work is different and there is alot of qigong stuff out there that is so so....but for me this is the real deal.

Try your best at every moment, relax down to the soles of your feet, and practice qigong everyday!",1178841600,7,858,4.545454545454546
8131269,3,B000GEYNP8,"the wudan set is only 16 forms with some standing meditations and a few supplimental exercises; you would think they could offer greater depth of information in a supposedly 2-hour DVD.

the other reviewer is correct in saying that this video is not for newcomers. but this is not because of the complexity or the subtelties, but rather because of the poor instruction and poor overall production quality. an advanced practitioner has a well-laid foundation and can learn from any medium. a newcomer would likely throw this dvd in the garbage once the thrill of ""i'm learning wudan!"" has faded.

i'm a big fan of wudan qigong, as i am with most qigong sets of taoist origin. the master in the video has okay form (he gets a tad lazy with the motions from time to time in the instructional section), but the low budget production really takes away from the integrity of the video. if you're a novice looking to learn from a video, don't waste your money with this one.

the translation is dubious. the master is saying words (like wuji) which are not being translated. the entire dvd is shot on a home video. he breaks down the moves in a front yard, and then goes through the entire set at a park. there is no audio as he goes through the entire set. the camera is stationary. the people in the background are a bit distracting.

i was disappointed in this dvd, but i give it 3 stars because i'm still able to learn from it. if i were new to qigong, however, i would have given it 1 star.",1167177600,3,1488,4.41970802919708
8131270,5,B000GEYNP8,Very good DVD. Explained and demonstrated in great detail. Advanced. But beginners won't be discouraged. Great supplement to good Qigong books for a visual reference.,1164931200,3,166,5.68
