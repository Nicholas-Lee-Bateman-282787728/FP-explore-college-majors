8253780,5,B00140R8DC,Fascinating materials and results of over a decade of work.  It's incredible that there were over 100 types of scientific evidence that were used to prove the age of the earth that have been rejected b/c they show a younger earth than is possible according to secular reasoning.  Why do they no longer recognize salinity in the oceans?  Sediment in Oceans?  Helium in the atmosphere?  C14 in diamonds and coal?  Comets in the solar system that should have burned out over 3 billion years ago?,1381795200,4,492,4.729411764705882
8253781,4,B00140R8DC,"There are people who seem to have their mind made up, and do not wish to view any more evidence, especially anything that is contrary to their personal conclusions or beliefs.  You'll find such people on both sides of the ""creation science"" issue.  Most of the comments on this video come from the ""evolution science"" side.  It is evident that there are people who care not to expose themselves to evidence that may show that their ""science"" is anything but flawless, and they are doing all they can to convince the rest of us not to investigate such evidence either.  I prefer to keep a more open mind than that, so I have purchased the video.  I really want to know.

I understand there is a companion book, and a much more detailed scholarly work available as a result of the six-plus year long scientific study that was the basis this video.  It is available for those with the proper training (and mindset) to understand.  I would hope that others would follow, in true scientific fashion, to repeat the experiments that led to the conclusions offered here.  If they do so, I would love to purchase their video as well.",1355529600,4,1124,4.58
8253782,1,B00140R8DC,"Thanks to Dr. Davies, I will not waste my time on a complete review, as I wasted too much watching the DVD. His review was very accurate. The DVD does have entertainment value, though. I enjoyed watching how information is twisted to support a particular point of view. Science is useful to help us explain some truths about the unknown. In this case, it is clear that it is being used to push an agenda.",1330300800,,404,4.4

8253784,3,B00140R8DC,"Those who cannot examine their own presuppositions will not like this book. It is not a charge that can be levelled at its authors.

It is an unabashed attempt to critique radioisotope dating, based on an open profession of adherence to Genesis. It reminds me that earth dating is not based on isotopes, for it was largely determined before their discovery, it also points out how discrepant dating methods can be (with some published inconsistencies reaching 1 or even 2 orders of magnitude), of how isotope dating or recent volcanic eruptions can overdate by tens or scores of millions of years, and of how radioisotope dates are overruled by index fossil dates.

Nevertheless the problem for young earth creationists of rapid radioactive decay and its problematic consequences are handled with brutal and self effacing honesty. No one in his right mind could honestly claim this is a sinister work of propaganda (did Marx, Goebbels or Mao Tse Tung ever use such an approach to persuade gainsayers?!).

The work cites empirical data for heavily disproportionate helium trapping in zircons and revisits the polonium radiohaloes the creationist Gentry first published about in Science. Whilst there are aggressive and often vituperative critiques of this on the internet, and some make reasonable methodological and interpretative criticisms, I have still not read a convincing alternative explanation for these phenomena. There are still charges to be answered.

Whilst the idea of change in radioisotope decay rates seems almost as outrageous as the transient c = 0 states or the idea of interaction speeds faster than c that Einstein so despised, both these latter have since been empirically been demonstrated. Solar flare activity is also now known to influence decay rates slightly. When faced with the huge black holes of ignorance about basic matter and the nuclear forces, a wise man holds his peace and gathers all the data carefully.

Scoffers will probably not find themselves persuaded, believers may be mildly comforted but will draw their root assurances from stronger data of another kind, and critical readers will take some interesting challenges to our generation's sacred cow of uniformitarianism away with them.",1224201600,17,2232,5.276056338028169
8253785,1,B00140R8DC,"In writing this review I'm betraying the memory of my dear old dad, God bless him.  Not because he forbade me to comment upon Creationist dogma, but because he always insisted that when someone came up with a contentious viewpoint, the best course of action was to listen to what he had to say in full, and then go away and think about it before commenting myself.

This principle has served me well, up to now.  I have to admit that I only managed to get half way through this pitiful DVD (loaned to me by a colleague) before making up my mind about it (I did try, Dad, honestly, before letting you down).  But, let you down I must, because I'm sure that you yourself wouldn't have wanted me to waste two minutes of my life, let alone another twenty-two, on this rubbish.

So why is it so bad?  Well, Thousands not Billions puts its cards on the table right at the outset:  it's already made up its own mind that Scripture and Science are incompatible, because to admit to the latter would (in its own view, I hasten to add) invalidate the Biblical story of the Creation and hence the idea that every death occurred as a result of Original Sin.  There is a logic there, but it then immediately tramples underfoot logic, evidence, objectivity and all those other qualities deemed desirable if not downright essential to scientific enquiry in its attempt to prove its own thesis.

Let's have a look at some of this reasoning, shall we?  TnB believes that the radiological dating of the Earth is fundamentally flawed,  in that it is plausible that the rate of radioactive decay may have slowed down drastically since the birth of the planet.  This would necessarily call into question the established means of dating rocks by comparing concentrations of radioisotopes and their decay products.  To support this argument, TnB argues that isochron dating is unreliable because of the discrepancies in the ages that different methods yield.  However, these ages all average out in the billions of years, not thousands.  TnB seems to have deliberately chosen `outlier' ages as representative of isochron dating as a whole, and then says that this bolsters their conception of the Earth being a lot younger than evidence would suggest.  This is rather like a detective who, after being given varying height descriptions of a suspect, immediately goes on to conclude that they are seeking a dwarf.

Not content with displaying reasoning with flaws so huge you could drive a double-decker bus through them, TnB goes on to show how Creation Science can be equally as blinkered in other ways.  TnB looks at the `evidence' for radioactive decay rates being much higher in the past than they were in the present day.  Such evidence would call into question radio-dating in its entirety.  To prove its point, it claims that the concentration of helium in naturally-occurring zircon crystals is much higher than would be expected given helium's propensity for diffusion.  As helium could only be generated within a crystal by alpha decay, TnB claims that the decay process has been accelerated to balance diffusive loss.

At this particular point, I decided it was time to take stock, so I did some searching on the Internet to see if there were any alternative perspectives on the experimental data.  Hardly surprisingly I found a great deal of disagreement with TnB's interpretation.  Firstly, the supposedly rapid diffusion rates for helium were obtained by doing measurements under vacuum, not atmospheric pressure.  Moreover, no control measurements were taken, such as measuring the concentration of helium-3 in the crystals.  Helium-3 is not produced by radioactive decay so an appreciable concentration would have shown that contamination and not radioactive decay was responsible for the high concentration of both helium isotopes.

I suspected the DVD would continue in the same vein of sloppy reasoning and wishful thinking which, if you believe critical reviews, it does.  There is a whole section devoted to `polonium halos', radioactive scars left in rocks supposedly by the decay of the short lived element polonium.  Of course, there is no evidence presented that long-lived radioactive elements such as uranium or thorium could not have created such haloes, or that these scars are in fact caused by alpha decay exclusively.  The first job of any scientist advancing a very contentious hypothesis is to try to find ways to knock that hypothesis down.  This production seems to go out of its way to avoid doing just that, even when such ways are in plain view.

Admittedly it's a slick production, masquerading as dispassionate scientific enquiry, but it's anything but.  This is `science' for creationists, climate change deniers, in fact all those people who would rather that the Universe was other than it actually is.  People who prefer to be told how to think rather than actually developing critical reasoning skills for themselves.  People who seek to modify scientific evidence in light of their views, rather than doing the reverse.  Tail, meet Dog.

Mercifully, Creation Science has yet to take root in the UK, where I am based, and I hang onto the hope that our education system proves robust enough to stop it from so doing.  Right at the beginning of `The Selfish Gene' Richard Dawkins points out that the first question that an alien race encountering humanity will ask themselves, in measuring our development as a species, is `do they believe in evolution?'  In other words, `have they figured out where they come from?'  If you're wondering why the strange lights have stopped appearing in American skies in recent years,  this DVD will provide the answer.",1210204800,12,5675,4.962962962962963
