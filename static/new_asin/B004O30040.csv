She heads home with the two Takagama brothers and Ko, an absent-minded shrine maiden, tags along. Immediately the boys' lives are forever changed. But for better or worse? The boys encounter many harmful supernatural creatures and even other deities, but Kugen, even though her curiosity and mischief can cause problems, she is always there when they need her.

This is an anime that is funny and full of supernatural battle scene action. Some parts are a little slow-paced and boring at times, but overall it's a good fantasy anime. (24 episodes total that are split into two volumes.)",1390089600,,682,5.035398230088496
