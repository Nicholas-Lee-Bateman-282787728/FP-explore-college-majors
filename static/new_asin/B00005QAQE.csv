1645911,5,B00005QAQE,"This DVD is one of the best Kunf Fu flicks around. If you only own 2 Gorden Liu DVDs, it should be this one and Master Killer.
This film is a pleasure to watch from start to finish, having superb action, a good story, great costumes, and women who can fight as well. Gorden Liu's superb skills show, especailly while he trains in the pond at Wu-Tang mountain.
The costumes and sets give this film a higher visual standard, putting it a different arena than other old school Kung Fu films.
The fights in this film are designed beautifully, filled with plenty of traditional kung fu, incredible staff(pole) handling, and a few wire tricks as well.
There's even a fight where Gorden Liu takes on a dozen spearmen while his sister is tied to his back. Sounds almost hokey, but its done in a flawless fashion. The final battle is truly phenominal, but I don't want to give a way the ending...go see it for yourself, for the 14 bucks you'll spend, this one's a must buy.",1008115200,5,964,4.451977401129944
1645912,5,B00005QAQE,"WHY, WHY, WHY?!? Why must they edit what is quite possibly THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME, period. I don't understand. They'll let us see a guy get half his face sliced off, but cut a very powerful scene in which the elder Yang commits suicide(by doing a 3-story-high, double flip into a flying, brain-exploding headbut on top of what I guess to be the Yang family monument, double-flips back down to the ground and dies on his feet) rather than surrender to the mongols! Despite the foul editing, this movie is so tight that it is virtually unruinable and still worthy of 5+ stars and the 12 or 13 bucks it costs.
Believe me, from the clever beginning [7 leave, 6 return(s)] to the wicked, bloody end, and excellent, intense, martial arts action from ear to ear, this flick surpasses even the Five Deadly Venoms and Master Killer.
starring Gordon ""master killer"" Liu, Fu Sheng, Wong Lung Wei
directed by Liu Chia Liang.
Definitely deserves your attention.",1006732800,12,956,4.696428571428571

1645925,4,B00005QAQE,"Overall this was money well spent.  The Martial Action was extremely good and it had a real plot.  You understand the drive of the Bad Guys and they have real objectives.  The good guys are not overly obsessed with revenge and they present a real sense of family.

One of the hallmarks of the genre movie is the action scenes. And this movie delivers.  I saw a couple of those high jumps where the wires were obvious but overall it was excellently done.

On the downside.  This offering has not been remastered.  The Video is still good but not excellent.  The English dubbing was incredibly good and I was actually unaware this movie was not filmed in English.

There are No Special Features. Which I find disappointing.

In the movie itself I was rather unhappy with the backdrops.  They were obvious and for me a little hard to shrug off.  And that is my only complaint.

Overall very well done.",1477180800,,898,4.53125

1646009,4,B00005QAQE,"8 Diagram Pole Fighter is a favorite among many kung-fu film fans and it isn't very difficult to see why. In the realm of Shaw Brothers kung-fu cinema, this one has all the staples of a good flick. Gordon Liu plays the role of the pole fighter (though I still don't quite know what the 8 diagram part is about) and dedicates himself to the monk lifestyle after an upbringing of war. After nearly all his brothers are killed, Liu spends years becoming a monk, even though he is told he will never be accepted as one of them.

The make up, costumes and set pieces were all great and helped contribute to an authenticity of the film. Not to mention the early but not over use of wire-fu and how incredibly effective it was. The kung-fu and pole fighting were excellent and the choreography was even better. If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino's movies you can tell this is one that he really loves, many of the sights and sounds of the film are referenced in his kung-fu/samurai epic Kill Bill.",1399075200,4,992,4.420765027322404

1646013,5,B00005QAQE,"8 Diagram Pole Fighter was released in 1983. It is directed by the late Lau Kar Leung and stars Gordon Liu,Kara Hui,Lily Li,Phillip Ko,Johny Wang,and Alexander Fu Sheng.

8 Diagram Pole Fighter is based on the Yang Family generals. When the battle between the Liao Dynasty against the Yang Family in golden beach took place,the Yangs were betrayed by general Pun Mei. General Yeung Yip and all six sons of the Yang family fought in battle and only the fifth and sixth brother survived. They managed to escape,Sixth Son went back home and was left traumatized and fifth son took refuge in a monestary in Mount Wutai. He changed his ways and became a monk after many years. The Khitans were still searching for the remaining brothers and their last resort was to kidnap fifth Yang's younger sister. After younger sister has been kidnapped,fifth brother finds out her whereabouts and decides to break the buddhist code to rescue her and avenge his family's death.

8 Diagram Pole Fighter has got to be one of the best Shaw Brothers martial arts films of all time and from the early 80s. This has got to be Lau Kar Leung's top five best films among Heroes of the East,36th Chamber,Mad Monkey Kung Fu,Martial Arts of Shaolin.",1390867200,3,1220,4.723004694835681

1646042,5,B00005QAQE,"I bought this on an old vhs bootleg about 12 years ago and swore if they ever remastered this movie i would buy it again. I never thought the day would come but it did. The picture and sound quality is superb. All the shaw bros movies that they remastered will be worth getting on blu-ray because shaw bros are miles above other old school kungfu films. This one stars Gordon Liu and Alexander Fu sheng as the lone survivers of ill fated mission when the leaders of the yang army are betrayed and ambushed by the mongals. This is one of my favorite Gordon Liu films but then most of his shaw bros movies to me are 5 star epics. It has some of the most breath taking kungfu scenes ever filmed. This move also has one of the best finales i have ever seen. It will leave even the most hard core old school kungfu fans satisfied. Its hard to believe Fu Sheng was going to be the main star and not Liu. Fu Sheng died while shooting this film and they had to rearrange it for Gordon. They did an amazing job. The score that they used in this movie was also great. It was beautiful and it really set the tone and  mood for the film.  Like the ""36th Chamber Of Shaolin"",(another great musical score) i noticed they didn't rehash it and use it in other shaw bros movies. This movie is also uncut. If you have the Crash Cinema version of this movie you will know what i'm talking about. This dvd is worth getting. Dragon Dynasty hasn't released anything since 2011. I hope they didn't go out of business. There are tons more shaw bros movies i would like to see released on dvd and blu-ray.",1379289600,2,1580,4.228476821192053

1646049,5,B00005QAQE,"Simply put, anyone who actually knows anything about old school kung fu joints, knows that 8 Diagram Pole Fighter is an absolutely must have!  You have the usual Lau brothers collaboration - Directing and acting - you have the usual historical / rebel content.  You even have Gordon Lau playing a very angry, but honorable soldier - to be expected as the person Alexander Fu Sheng, who was supposed to play the lead throughout this movie was killed in a car accident before the film was finished.  In fact, it took the legendary lau kar leung a few years to recover from having lost one of his prized actors and students, before he could finish the movie.  Alexander Fu Sheng is the fighter who goes insane after the ambush of his family on the battle field.  You notice how he is only in the first part of the movie.  Lau Kar Leung - real kung fu master - is the hunter who saves Gordon Lau's life in the old shed.

This was a movie that I first watched one late night and thought ""##@%, that final fight scene made my teeth hurt!"" It took a while to grow on me.  Let's not forget how Phillop Ko Fe does an excellent job as Gordon Lau's reluctant pole instructor.  That battle they have before Lau leaves the temple is legendary!  Yeah, the tone of this is very dark - and very angry - No better place is this seen than when Lau demands that the monks shave his head, and then proceeds to roughly do so when they refuse.

This is a revenge story - as most of these are - but there are real stories behind this movie that drives it.  It is also great to see Lau use his real Hung Gar pole fighting skills throughout the movie.  If you are one who prefers hand to hand combat, this is not for you.  Even so, if you are a collector, you cannot justify not having 8 Diagram Pole Fighter in your collection, right next to The Five Deadly Venoms, Master Killer, and Five Shaolin Masters!",1346630400,,1882,4.264788732394366
1646050,5,B00005QAQE,"Well lets see.... There are over 800 Shaw Brothers movies and of that, maybe 50 cut the list as worth watching for one reason or another. Of that number, less than 10 will make the cut as excellent Kung Fu. But the top 5.... woof! The fighting has to be second to none. Here is a case where the story does not necessarily kill the movie if it is bad.
Well, what could be that phenominal. Practicing myself since 1972 and being a second generation Bruce Lee instructor, it takes alot. Just hold these Gordon Liu movies alongside any other fight scenes in any other Shaw Brothers Movies and the timing, speed, strength, and stage presence will pale.
Quite simply, It is 36th Chamber of Shaolin for training, Heores of the East for the most amazing choreographed fight scenes, and showcasing real Hung Gar Gung Fu vs. Judo, Karate Ninjitsu, tasseled spear vs. spear, 3 sectional vs. nunchaku and sai, Samurai Sword vs. broadsword and butterfly swords vs. sai.
But!! if you want to see the tasseled spear used beyond what you saw in Heroes of the East, then 8 diagram pole fighter is the 3rd movie to put in your collection.... Period! The story is pulsating and dark. It is devastating in its violence. And Gordon Lius' use of the tasseled spear is simply the best pole work you will see. And I am not talking about spectatcular Wu Fu kung fu movies using Wushu. I am referring to shear insane, ballistic and angry-vengeful fighting. You would think the wood on the spear was going to explode from the shear power with which Gordon Wields it. It is what it is ""The best tasseled spear work put on film. Out of 1200 or so total old school kung fu movies made. Even it its not your favorite story, as a study in REAL Spearwork you will never need to view another person wielding one to get your entertainment.
Want the last 2 on my list to bring in the top 5 for Sheer real fighting? Well its also Gordon Lius'. Shaoin vs. Wu Tang... with tons of great fights and one of the best opening Shaw Brothers credits. And, fifth on our list of simply the best top 5 is.....Well... there is no 5th. The fighting and training in these 4 movies are stand alone. However, Fists and Guts has one of the best weapons fight scenes midway through. That fight looks like it was choreographed into Heroes of the East.",1340582400,4,2295,4.440758293838862

1646052,5,B00005QAQE,"Look, eliminate all the BS from the few naysayers that this classic joint from the Golden era of Kung Fu is less than stellar. Lau Kar Fai's performance as the 5th Yang is truly one of his best performances not only as a Martial Artist but also as an actor. If you can't appreciate this then you who watch today's action movies and like them cannot say you like Al Pacino's old school performance in Scarface. The Shaw Brothers movies like this are like the best Rod Serling episodes from the Twilight Zone. They are the blueprints for Jet Li, Jackie Chan Donnie Yen and countless others who make a very good living on this lost genre of revenge style footage we real connesseiurs of Hong Kong action know and love. This one is Raw Footage from beginning to end. The story is great and the dark portrayal of the 5th Yang hating he lived thru the battle of his family and dedication to getting even is without peer. The battle at the end is like witnessing a 21 point touchdown at the end of the 4th qtr being down by 3 and the training sequences are awe inspiring. Get this one Yo. I can't say enuff. I watched this as a kid in NY on channel 5 in the early 80's and it still is as dope today as when I first saw it.

1646055,5,B00005QAQE,"Geez, the way these martial arts films would have it, it's hell each time on whoever tries to get accepted into the Shaolin temple. But let's back up a bit. EIGHT DIAGRAM POLE FIGHTER (or INVINCIBLE POLE FIGHTER) - a tale of martial arts and betrayal and the exacting of bloody vengeance - is an old school must-see if you're a fan of the wuxia pian genre. It showcases the talents of luminaries such as Gordon Liu, Kara Hui, Alexander Fu Sheng, and iconic director Liu Chia Liang (who, as per norm, nabs a juicy cameo for himself). Note that Liu Chia Liang's trademark silly humor is absent on this screen, the dark, brooding tone being that prevalent.

The plot? When the seven spear-wielding Yang brothers and their father march onto The Battle of Jinsha, they fall victim to a calculated ambush by the jealous General Pan Mei. The Yangs are slaughtered but for the fifth and sixth brothers, except that the sixth brother is promptly rendered brain-addled by what he'd endured. Which leaves the 5th brother, seething in his need for vengeance, and this p! ssed off fifth brother is played by the awesome Gordon Liu.

Back home, what remains of the now disgraced Yang family - basically, the womenfolk and the demented 6th brother (yep, crazy had come to the Yang household) - is planning to testify against General Pan Mei in front of the Emperor, but not if Pan Mei has anything to say about it.

Meanwhile, Fifth Brother makes his way to an isolated Shaolin temple, a place in which he thinks he can bide his time and be patient and revenge is a dish best served cold and whatnot. He informs the monks that he also wants to become a monk, but no one buys his fake sincerity. It finally falls on the angry 5th Brother to shave his own head and brand those scar dots on his own dome, and this is what we friggin' call resolve. He settles in. He maybe even finds a modicum of peace. We know it won't last.

Director Liu Chia Liang once again applies his inventiveness, and so we get moments like the ones which feature the Yang patriarch's unbelievable death scene, 5th Brother's self-branding, and 5th Brother's defanging of the wooden wolf. For imaginative set pieces, Liu Chia Liang throws in that pyramid of coffins and the bamboo poles of righteousness. It's a given that he'll choreograph a series of high quality fights, very much including 5th Brother's duel with the Abbot and the memorable climactic all-out brawl at the inn (in which the fiendish Tartars - or Mongols - lose a horrifying number of teeth). I like that the wire-work isn't overdone. As a bonus, the lovely Kara Hui impresses once more with her kung fu skills. Gordon Liu, man, what can I say about Gordon Liu? He's got screen presence. He can fight. He can even act. Although, it's not demonstrated here, he can handle comedy as well as the dramatic bits. His work with the pole is tremendous.

1983 and EIGHT DIAGRAM POLE FIGHTER marked a dark time for the Shaw Brothers as the studio's golden boy, Alexander Fu Sheng, suffered a fatal accident early during the shooting of the film. Rumor has it that Fu Sheng had been slated for a larger role, but obviously things had to be switched up, and so Sixth Brother became relegated to staying at home being all deranged. This is also one of Liu Chia Liang's most violent movies, and I can't help but think that Fu Sheng's passing had brought about this bleak mood. I imagine Fu Sheng's death must've cast a hell of a gloomy shadow over cast & crew. And the last thing for me: I'm disappointed that this Dragon Dynasty DVD doesn't offer an audio commentary from Hong Kong action film expert Bey Logan (or any other bonus material, for that matter). What, did Bey Logan finally get a life?

On this DVD, the movie gives you the option of listening to it in either Mandarin or messed-up sounding English. Go with the Mandarin, and instead read the English sub-titles, friend.",1288569600,4,3897,4.5759312320916905

1646063,3,B00005QAQE,"The first thing you should know is that Red Sun is a bootleg company. They steal the film's masters from its true owners and publish them on these discs. Red Sun discs come with essentially no bonus features, different audio tracks, or any bells or whistles.
  But since most of the true releases of these DVDs are fairly impossible to get your hands on, the Red Sun releases are usually worthwhile. The release of Invincible Pole Fighter, however, isn't worth your time. It's a very good kung fu flick with some of Gordon Liu's best work, but the audio quality is simply terrible. My suggestion is to try to find it at a video rental place or somewhere so you get to see it, but this disc isn't worth adding to your collection.
  Not to say Red Sun is terrible quality overall, most are fine. Return of the Master Killer, Five Deadly Venoms/Crippled Avengers, among others have the best quality picture and sound available...this one just didn't get it done.",1206835200,5,959,4.623529411764705
1646064,5,B00005QAQE,"I actually wanted to give this movie 4 1/2 stars. Liu Chia Liang aka Lau Kar Leung, actually plays two different roles in the movie.  Guess they figured no one would notice...or care.  Now that that's out of the way, let me get to the good stuff.

  This movie is one of Shaw Brothers' best.  It's one of Lau Kar Leung's best.  It's one of Gordon Liu's best.  Are you noticing a theme?  In truth, it's not THE best.  But the action in this movie is superb.  The plot is good as well. Not as campy as most of these movies tend to be.  Watching Fu Sheng was kind of surreal after realizing that this was his last role.  But he was excellent and it's easy to see that he was on the verge of being a major star in Hong Kong.

  I also gained a new appreciation of Lau.  As a director, but even more so as a fight instructor and choreographer.  Kara Hui shows off some excellent work with the sword as well as the Kwon Do.  For someone who didn't study martial arts she really shows an incredible level of athleticism.

  Overall this movie will not disappoint.  If you love martial arts movies, then this is a must have.  A classic!!",1203379200,,1129,4.168224299065421
1646065,4,B00005QAQE,"This is a much better than average kung fu film from Shaw Bros. and Lau Kar Leung.  After an attack by the Mongols that leaves 4 of his 5 brothers dead, Yang #5 (Gordon Liu) kind of bullies his way into a Buddhist temple to train for revenge.  Meanwhile Yang #6 (Alexander Fu Sheng, who died in a car crash during production) returns home with little, if any, of his sanity intact.

When the Yang mother finds out about #5's err, uh... aliveness... and monastic residence, she sends Yang sister #8 (Kara Hui) to bring him home.  She is, of course, captured by the Mongols and #5 must set out to rescue her.  Luckily he has been studying zoological dentistry and is up to the task.

Part of the joy in watching these films is the sheer beauty of photography, and while this is no exception, it has a few exceptions.  I love the use of sets in Shaw Bros. productions, but this movie has a couple that are rather blatant.  Walls painted to look like exteriors are usually placed several yards behind the actors and other props to avoid obvious detection.  We're talking about .02% of the movie so the complaint is minor.  The fights are all with weapons, which is slightly disappointing, but they're all very good.  My only other complaint is that whoever dubbed Fu Sheng's voice as he yells a lot of incoherent psychotic ramblings is  terribly annoying, but we're talking like another .02% of the flick, so, no biggie.

1984.  aka:  8 Diagram Pole Fighter; Invincible Pole Fighter",1195862400,3,1478,4.566539923954372
1646066,5,B00005QAQE,"I bought the 8 Diagram Pole Fighter not expecting much.  It has shown on a few enthusiasts lists, but its limited availability left many newer kung fu enthusiasts not knowing its splendor.  I literally tacked it onto my Amazon order as an afterthought from a marketplace vendor cheap.

What I was treated to was a super fast paced, superbly choreographed spear and pole movie that kept me absorbed until the last frame.  The fights in this movie were like nothing I have seen.  And it has a darker feel to it than most Shaw Bros. films (largely attributed to Fu Sheng's death during filming).  It has battlefield spear fighting, fighting on a horse (that's two people, one horse), a fight on stacked coffins (has to be seen), and a one on one pole fight with the head monk that is among the best pole fights I have ever seen on film.

The acting is a bit melodramatic.  Which works with Gordon Liu, but not some of the other characters.  I think that is mainly because Liu has a great intense look, so he can pull off the quiet, intense, melodramatic.  The particular edition I got (I believe a Red Sun edition) is ok, but not great.  And it is in English dub only, even though it has an 'original language' option on the DVD.  It's still English.

If you want this movie, have a bit more money to spend, and have a region free dvd player, expand your search.  There are some remastered, original language versions out there.  Otherwise, if you want to only spend a few bucks on this edition, go for it.  It is definitely worth the money either route you go.  This ranks as one of my favorite Shaw Bros., one of my favorite Gordon Liu, and heck, one of my favorite... period.",1194480000,2,1675,4.421568627450981

Wonderful Choreography and full of action. The Plot was good, and the story line a slight confusion but all in all Magnificent. The coffin Fight Yes I said ""Coffin fight"" alone to save his sister was amazing. Get this one Everyone this is Awesome!

1646069,4,B00005QAQE,"This movie was fantastic. I am a person who was not allowed to watch a  lot of kung fu movies, and fighting as a kid but I am diving head first back into this fun realm.

The movie starts and ends with action, has a fantastic plot, and has fairly believable acting throughout. Gordon Liu (Brother #5) was excellent as a young warrior that had to swallow his pride, and instincts of revenge long enough to attack in the end. The only reasons why it was not a five-star movie was because the other brothers who got ambushed and killed were on so briefly, that their actual number of birth did not even matter. In addition, it was hard to figure out who was good, and evil but at the same time that part was a strength of the movie. A major reason for this was because the Yang family was well known throughout the area as upholders of the law, but the evil general was trying to kill all of the brothers, and end their faithful rebellious following. In reality he had them set up, and then tried to find the remaining two brothers and charge them for treason.

Good questions to ask yourself when watching this movie are:

If the head monk of the Buddhist temple was such a great fighter, then why would a Mongel ambush pose even the smallest threat?

If Brother #5 knew that the anti-pole weapons used by the general's men were what killed his brothers, then why did he not train to nullify their ability?

Why did Brother #4 really go crazy, and how were they going to have him cured?

This is a must have movie with actors that are in many of the good Shaw Brothers/ Wu-Tang/ Shaolin movies. The fighting skills were very good, and there wasn't much use of the ""fake receeding hairline shoguns"" of other movies which mostly has you laughing instead of paying attention to the plot.",1170892800,3,1782,4.381818181818182

I'm not going to say it is the greatest of all time....but it very well may be.  Not only do you have a dark, emotional tale starring an all-star Shaw Brothers cast, but you also have a film directed by the greatest kung fu filmmaker of all time, Lau Kar Leung (Liu Chia Liang).  In ""8 Diagram Pole Fighter"" (Invincible Pole Fighter), he directed both the greatest pole fight of all time(Gordon Lui vs. Phillip Ko Fei) and one of the most brutal, over the top final fights in all of kung fu history.  Do yourself a favor though and don't buy this version.  Instead, buy an all-region DVD player and pick up Celestial's beutiful, remastered version.

1646073,5,B00005QAQE,"(AKA Eight Diagram Pole Fighter/The Magnificent Pole Fighter) I've got quite a few chopsocky films under my belt now, and I have to say, in terms of pure visceral rush, this one's hard to beat.  If you think i'm recommending you plunk down your hard-earned ducats for mediocre pose-and-vogue old-school kung fu, check that thought at the door.  Its easy to tell this is a far more polished Shaw bros. extravaganza than normal - the costuming is great, the dialogue and acting are actually non-cringeworthy, and best of all, the fight choreography is simply top-notch and on par with some of the more modern kung-fu extravaganzas.  This movie is a peerless showcase for the great Gordon Liu, who is the kind of raging bada$$ that makes normal non-religious folk want to take up the staff and join the Shaolin temple.  The pole fighting in this movie is simply spectacular.  Only the opening scene in Jet Li's _Twin Warriors_ comes close.
Naturally, there are lots of plot inconsistencies - Fu Sheng, Brother No. 6, died midway through the shooting - so his character just sort of vanishes.  In a touch of unintentional kung-fu irony, the Yang brothers never really get names, just numbers - and even though we're given a lengthy introduction to their skills and the actors that portray them, most of them are quickly dispatched in the first five minutes of the movie.
I'm not quite sure what folks are complaining about as far as the DVD quality; the transfer is actually pretty clear, the audio decent, and there are even a few interesting cast bios and stills thrown in on the DVD - more than standard old-school DVDs usually contain.  Recommended for any fan of martial art for any reason, whether or not you're a fan of the Venom crew, need to add a good pole-fighting movie to your arsenal, or just want an old-school film that isn't bad - this is your beast.",1036281600,,1863,4.696319018404908

Also, I am a huge Gordon Liu fan. Now with that said...I'm wondering if all these reviewers that rated this 4-5 stars watched the same movie I did. Looking at this film from a kung-fu point of view, it is not good. The first hour barely has any kung-fu at all and what there is of it is sloppy and unconditioned. The choreography for this film is extremely sloppy and campily wire assisted. When the kung-fu finally comes into play (a good hour nto the film) it is a bunch of monks attacking wooden wolves and trying to break their teeth. Then when the real kung-fu starts with Gordon pinned against a mob of guys, the kung-fu is poor and again, wire assisted. This is not old-school kung fu at its best and if you think it is then you really have been watching some bad kung fu movies.
I gave this film 2 stars. One for the story and one for what little kung-fu there is. (Namely, the scene with the sister fighting) If you want to see some real kung-fu at its best with gordon liu, do yourself a favor and pick up ""Fist of the White Lotus"" or ""Shaolin Drunken Monk"" Both exceptional kung-fu films.",1021507200,14,1265,4.275
