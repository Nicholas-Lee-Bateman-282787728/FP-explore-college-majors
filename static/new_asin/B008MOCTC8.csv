5170163,4,B008MOCTC8,"I like Jason Dohring as an actor and that's why I bought this movie.  It was different than I thought it would be, as it was quirky and not serious.  Although you probably need an oddball sense of humor to like it--I enjoyed it and so did the family.  Jason delivered in his acting, and showed he can do comedy as well as serious acting.",1353542400,,337,4.153846153846154
5170164,5,B008MOCTC8,"This movie is hilarious! Such a funny cast, and I was left guessing the whole time! Jason Dohring does a great job and Masi Oka's role is so funny. Although it is a semi-murder mystery, it is also a comedy that will have you laughing through the entire movie. Definitely a movie you can watch with friends, I highly recommend it!",1352419200,,329,4.409836065573771
5170165,3,B008MOCTC8,"'Searching for Sonny' didn't take itself too seriously and viewers shouldn't either.  If you're expecting a film grounded in reality and every day believability, well, you won't find it here.  There was some humor, a little drama, a little action, but mostly it was filled with an offbeat absurdity that held a charm of its own. It wasn't a film noir or even a satire of one, but it had elements of such in a broader sense.  I bought the film because I'm a huge Jason Dohring fan and it was nice seeing him again.  If you're a fan of him, you'll enjoy the film.  If you like offbeat quirky indie films you'll probably enjoy the film as well.",1346630400,5,641,4.352941176470588
5170166,5,B008MOCTC8,"I saw this film on the festival circuit this year and found myself laughing more and louder than I can recall doing in a movie theatre recently;  this film and Seth MacFarlane's ""Ted"" are far and away the two funniest films I've seen all year.  The screenplay deliriously twists and turns in ways you never see coming, and that only enhance the comedy.  The performances are spot-on across the board, and I was stunned to learn after the screening that this was the director's first feature, given that the filmmaking was so assured, and with a very specific tone and voice that felt like it had been cultivated over time.  I look forward to seeing more from him.  Give yourself a fun night and check out ""Searching for Sonny"".  I just ordered the blu-ray and am looking forward to seeing it again.",1346371200,7,798,4.584507042253521
5170167,4,B008MOCTC8,"Go here for my full review of ""Searching for Sonny"", from when I saw it premiere at the Palm Beach Int. Film Fest:

[...]

DAMN funny comedy, for the movie geek in all of us.",1346284800,2,174,3.942857142857143
5170168,5,B008MOCTC8,"I saw Searching For Sonny at a film festival last April. It is a very funny movie. I loved every moment, every hilarious situations! The movie kept me on the edge of my seat with anticipation of what was going to happen next. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who want to have a good laugh. I am looking forward to adding it to my DVD collection.",1346198400,2,362,4.260869565217392
5170169,4,B008MOCTC8,"This was better than I thought it would be and yet still not good enough to keep my total attention. I loved the cast and I loved the satirical-noir feel to it. However, the whole thing was very predictable, which made me want either a better cast or more satire.",1397260800,,263,4.28
5170170,4,B008MOCTC8,I rented this movie out of curiosity to see Jason Dohring and Minka Kelly.  A off beat comedy that I enjoyed.,1397001600,,109,4.190476190476191
5170171,4,B008MOCTC8,I wanted to see this because I'm a big fan of Jason Dohring. the whole movie was better and funnier than I thought it would be.,1397001600,,127,3.923076923076923
5170172,5,B008MOCTC8,"I watched this because I recently started watching ""Veronica Mars"", which is a tv show Jason Dohring was in. I loved the movie! The storytelling was fantastic. I really liked the backstory info, as well as the narration. The acting was great, and the directing was also good. Would recommend to anyone looking for a laugh and a mystery.",1392508800,5,336,4.711864406779661
5170173,2,B008MOCTC8,Like Jason Dohring since Veronica Mars but could not finish this film.  Needs a rewrite to make it a better film.,1392422400,,113,4.380952380952381
5170174,4,B008MOCTC8,"A light... very light comedy..  Justin Dolhman , I think that is right I liked.  His twin was quirky..  The story line , hm-m-m..  But just for fun, ok....",1391990400,,155,4.241379310344827
5170175,5,B008MOCTC8,"I bought this because it starred Jason Dohring from Veronica Mars.  Hadn't heard anything about it or read any reviews so I watched it without any expectations.  Loved it, a quirky independent film, with interesting and memorable characters.  The narrator, often overused in movies, was a good element here, adding to the comedic noir tone.  Not perhaps for everybody, but those who can appreciate less mainstream films should enjoy this one.",1371772800,4,442,5.183098591549296
5170176,5,B008MOCTC8,Fun little independent movie. Kinda dorky but that's what I liked about it. Not sure its for everyone but I can only speak for my own tastes.,1362182400,,141,4.2592592592592595
5170177,1,B008MOCTC8,Dislike. It was horrible. I didn't like it at all. I only watched it because I was paying for it.,1359936000,,97,3.9
5170178,5,B008MOCTC8,"This movie is a great example of how independent films are making a strong statement that quality can be just as good as the Hollywood level.
I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long, long time.
The two actors from Britanick are absolutely hilarious and steal the show!
Would definitely recommend this movie to everyone!",1357603200,,328,4.672413793103448
8529021,4,B008MOCTC8,"It is funny all cast, lines too!",1476489600,,32,3.7142857142857144
8529022,4,B008MOCTC8,"Bought the movie for Britanick and wasn't disappointed, they were easily the highlight of the the movie. It's an odd film, but if you're familiar with the style of humor of anyone in it and enjoy it, it's at least worth watching.",1463184000,,229,4.476190476190476
8529023,5,B008MOCTC8,This was so much better than I thought it would be.  Very clever and entertaining.,1439251200,,82,4.466666666666667
8529024,4,B008MOCTC8,"Hey, it's that guy from Veronica Mars!!  An enjoyable and quirky movie about a missing person and the efforts to find him all wrapped up in a mystery that isn't really so mysterious.  It's a comedy with voice over narration so we don't get confused.  I liked it.  Oh, and Minka Kelly looks good in red lipstick!!!",1429142400,,313,4.43859649122807
8529025,4,B008MOCTC8,I just love Jason Dohring! This has a nice noir flavor while still being modern.,1407628800,,80,4.4
8529026,3,B008MOCTC8,"Searching for Sonny was dull and lackluster.  The plot was actually interesting, but the acting ruined it.  If they were trying to mix comedy, drama and mystery it fell short.  I think they were trying to get a Phillip Marlow feel and well, it just didn't quite hit the mark.  Considering there was nothing else to watch on the alphabet channels we chose this.

I would recommend it to folks who have some time to kill.  Honestly, it put my husband to sleep.  I soldiered on to the very end, but was disappointed.  Make up your own mind.  It is included with Amazon Prime, so at least I didn't have any additional out of pocket expense to watch it.  Sorry, if you are a Jason Dohring fan you will probably like it.  It certainly wasn't JD's finest hour.",1404950400,,753,4.384057971014493
8529027,2,B008MOCTC8,"Sophomoric, cheesy, with attempts at humor that fall flat most of the time. Streamed this because I enjoyed Jason Dohring in Veronica Mars in which he was really good as anguished, punk teen. There's no edge in his character in this movie and the rest of the cast is also totally forgettable. Don't waste your time watching this, just not worth it, even if the streaming is for free.",1404000000,,383,4.565217391304348
8529028,5,B008MOCTC8,"Not what I expected, but funny and brilliant.  A BriTANick feature film.  Although I do not always enjoy their shorts, this film made me laugh at each new antic.  If you are watching the movie for Jason Dohring, you will not be disappointed.  He plays the straight man well.",1401840000,,274,4.530612244897959
8529029,4,B008MOCTC8,"I wasn't sure at first,  only watched it because of Veronica Mars, as Jason Dohring is in both.  I liked him in Veronica Mars better, but this was kind of funny and turned out better.  He plays the opposite kind of character, which was fun to watch and his tag along gang.  It was much better towards the middle and end.",1397692800,,320,4.19672131147541
