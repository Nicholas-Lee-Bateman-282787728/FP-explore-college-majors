I hope Disney collects their mistakes, and perhaps license Gargolyes to Lionsgate, or maybe Shout! Factory.  I think one of these independent companies, will be WILLING to release the rest of the cartoon series, in order to make the fans happy.  Please license Gargoyles to one of the independents!",1225324800,3,397,4.895522388059701
3430046,5,B001993Y7W,"Gargoyles has got to be one of my all time Favorites and it an American production too, now that's really something. However, Disney on the other hand BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! I think that Disney is owned by a Secret Society and that's why they're so EVIL.(PH34R T3H 3V1L) Can you think of a better EXCUSE? Why is it at this time when Disney is restoring all of thier past successes, Master Pieces of all time, all of thier best productions, that at this time one of thier greatest TV series ever of all time is being forgotten? Have they forgotten Duck Tales? Gummi Bears? Dark Wing Duck? Tale Spin? Chip'N'Dale Rescue Rangers? No they are putting all of these shows on DVD. So how about finishing Gargoyles? Oh, and that reminds me is this Season 3 actually the Goliath Chronicles or is that still yet to come? I hope to see the other half of season 2 come soon and for the completion of season 3 without any breaks like there is in season 2. So Come on Disney get with the freakin' program already 'cause dragging yer feet is so yesterday.",1221436800,32,1035,4.395833333333333

3430048,4,B001993Y7W,"I'm assuming that this is Disney's Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles, but as there is no in-depth information provided by Amazon.com I can't be sure.
Gargoyles is still one of my favorite shows of all time. I've been dying for the rest of the series to come out on DVD. I've searched the web (rather extensively) for any word on an upcoming release but alas I've come up dry. If and when this DVD is released, I'll be posting a more in-depth review of its content and quality. Until then support the previous Gargoyles releases and hope for the best.",1215648000,,550,4.565656565656566
3430069,5,B001993Y7W,Gargoyles was the best animated series ever! The release of this product is well overdue! Finish what you started... fans are waiting!,1352505600,5,134,5.136363636363637
3430070,5,B001993Y7W,"I own Gargoyles Season 1 and the first half of season 2. PLEASE release the second half of season 2 and season 3!!!!!  PLEASE!  We all want it, we'll buy it. You won't be sorry. Please don't leave us hanging. Bootleg copies just aren't good and aren't the way to go. Make some money and release the DVDs, please!!

And if you are reading this and haven't tried Gargoyles yet, DO! It is a quality cartoon with great plots and wonderful lessons for kids. A bit violent for the wee ones, but 8,9,10 and tweens do love this. Heck, I love it and I'm a grandmother!",1346803200,8,559,4.254716981132075
3430071,5,B001993Y7W,Growing up this has been my favorite television show of all time. It would be very nice to own all three seasons on DVD and would be very profitable if there was a Gargoyles box DVD set. Many people around the world love this show and would really enjoy having a gargoyles DVD box set and would pay well for one especially collectors. Something to think about. So what do you say? give us Gargoyles season 3 =),1346198400,,410,4.269230769230769
3430072,5,B001993Y7W,"Gargoyles is one of the finest stories out there.  It has everything: Love, romance, betrayl and a lot of action.  What's more, it does not seek to sugar coat the consequences of any of these traits, especially betrayl as the episodes of Season 2's ""City of Stone"" sharply demonstrated. It even proves that love can breach all barriers with the growing bond between Goliath and Elisa.
Season 3 shows that the world has more Gargoyle clans than was previously thought; including the eggs saved from the destruction of Castle Wyvern.  Among them, Angela, Goliath's own daughter is introduced and initates him into the wonderous realm of parent/child affection. Angela is given her own issues to over-come upon learning their greatest enemy, Demona is her mother.
All of the characters from the main protaganist; Goliath, to the least of the reacurring characters; Officer Bluestone, are richly portrayed and well rounded in their biographies.  Add to this the voices of such heavy hitters as: Keith David (Goliath), Jonthan Frakes(as the multi-layered villian David Xanatos), Marina Sirtis, CCH Pounder, Efram Zimblist, Jr., Emma Samms, Kate Mulgrew, Michael Dorn and Ed Asner and Gargoyles weaves a perfect tapestry of story telling and talent which makes these DVDs a must for any animated collection.",1333843200,9,1301,5.2105263157894735
3430073,5,B001993Y7W,I bought the first season and a half back in 2006 and have been waiting for the rest of the series to come out. I actually sent an email to Disney (and encourage others to do the same)asking them to release it.,1329868800,8,210,4.023809523809524
3430074,5,B001993Y7W,"OMG..

3430075,2,B001993Y7W,"Always watched Gargoyles when I was young, never forgot about. Took a long time to find it again. Every single episode was perfect; the plot, the characters, and the animation. I am now watching season three and I can barely stand it. Its disgusting compared to the first two seasons. What were they thinking? Everything has gone to hell; the animation, the voices, the characters, personalities AND THE PLOT. What happened? It was so good before? I feel as if season three is not related at all. Did they grab someone living in the alley to make this? I am extremely disappointed with the finale season. FOR YEARS I wondered what happened after the last Hunters Moon episode its was getting so good. So they destroy it? Worst mistake ever. Don't waste your time with this.",1292284800,5,773,4.6911764705882355
3430076,1,B001993Y7W,"Season 3, called ""Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles"", has very little to do with the original show, which I consider the best non-comedy animated show of all time. Greg Weisman, who is the creator of Gargoyles, had nothing to do with this season. In fact, season 2 had a perfect ending, that told the audience ""They will have many more chapters in their lives, but we've told our story. It's done.""

So here are the consequence of writing more pages when the book is closed. The plots were ridiculous. The writing was horrible. Even the animation suffered -- it looked really cheap and cheesy. They preserved the original voice cast, and the voices actors have all done a superb job, but it did little good to the nonsense scripts. I like to pretend that season 3 just never happened. Rather, it was a different show that I didn't care for.",1246060800,9,840,4.6375838926174495
3430077,5,B001993Y7W,"The Gargoyles series has always been a personal favorite of mine. I was finally able to watch the whole thing through YouTube. I would love to have the hardcopy in my hands so that I can watch it whenever I want! Please hurry and release it, I'll be waiting!!",1243987200,6,259,4.3061224489795915
3430078,5,B001993Y7W,This release has long been overdue. Disney fails to realize that there is a strong market for gargoyles. If there reason to cancel the release is because of the lackluster sales of volume one of season two then they fail to realize that customers prefer to purchase the complete season instead of volumes of tv series.,1234915200,39,318,4.696428571428571
8272984,2,B001993Y7W,"I am a huge Gargoyle fan, and have all the seasons except for season three. When I finished the first two seasons I went on a hunt for the third. I finely managed to find the episodes on the internet, and watched them there. Big mistake. I am not saying that it was terrible, terrible, but nothing happened in season three that I am satisfied with. The characters have lost there depth slightly, (Except for Demona and Angela.)  and seem to be there only to teach the viewer a lesson. For example, Hutson was to proud to admit he was going blind, but in the end learned that he should always go for help if he needs it. Kind of blah right? Secondly, nothing happens in this season that really connects with the last seasons. What happened to Coldstone,and Dezdemona?!  Where is the Remaining Hunter?! A few small part characters from the last season do reappear in some of the episodes, but very randomly, and with hardly any purpose. The last episode is rushed and pretty worthless as well. But what I hate most about this season is Demona's fate. Demona was my favorite from the start. I love her conflicted character, and was excited to see whether or not she would be redeemed. Yet the last of Demona you see is her crying on a roof top. It made me want to cry, and I think that was a terrible ending for her. Overall I did not like this season that much and would not watch it again",1519344000,,1387,4.351351351351352
8272985,5,B001993Y7W,"""The Goliath Chrinicles"" is an amazing continuation of the 'Gargoyles' storyline. You can buy this season digitally, but not DVD... which is really dumb. I myself would like to complete my collection with all the DVD's, worth it either way.",1498435200,,240,5.025
8272986,5,B001993Y7W,lets get it to gather DISNEY!  I bought the disney dvd club exclusive of season 2 part 2 only to find that you later released it with standard packaging and yes! I bought that to.  Give is the fans a break by giving us what we want.  I don't care what price I have to pay.  I once paid 75 dollars for a used copy of Lady and the Tramp!,1481500800,,335,3.742857142857143
8272987,5,B001993Y7W,"I bought seasons 1, 2, and 2.5, GIVE US THREE. I would have preferred to buy them ALL AT ONCE, but I've waited too long! It's been 20 years since this show was on the air, and frankly everyone underestimates how FREAKING AMAZING THIS SHOW IS!!",1463788800,,243,4.304347826086956
8272988,3,B001993Y7W,"Hope to see season 3 available soon (actually named ""Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles"", because Goliath would narrate the beginning and ending of episodes), whether it's released by Disney or ABC-Disney... When the show's crew was revamped for season 3, I only ever got to see bits and pieces on TV, as it was aired by ABC instead (which had then-recently become part of Disney). I only just found the first two seasons from Disney, sold by Disney itself, and after watching the first two in order, I'm in love with this series just as much as I was as a kid, and then some!! Although I remember season 3 being different than the original two, and not always in a good way, I would still love to see it properly.",1444953600,3,713,4.492307692307692
8272989,5,B001993Y7W,This show is awesome i wish they would already make this to dvd already! I buy the other ones vol 2 i pay like but then i find out that if i order from disney it self it would have been like 10 plz disney make the dvd soon the wait is killing me.,1415836800,,246,3.574074074074074

8272991,5,B001993Y7W,"I watched GARGOYLES when it first aired on TV. I've had Season 1 and Season 2 Volume 1 for some time. I finally picked up Season 2 Volume 2 this year. I would like to complete my collection of this great series. I've added Season 3 to both my Amazon Wish List and my Amazon Please Notify ping. Is Disney waiting to release all 3 Seasons on Blu-ray? Season 1 was 13 episodes. Season 2 was 52 episodes making the two volumes logical if not frustrating. I'm not sure how many episodes Season 3 contains, but it should be affordable on DVD at least. Is Disney reluctant because the show was 2D rather than CGI? GARGOYLES had grade-A voice talent and well thought out, character-driven plot lines. The animation had nice little little touches like tail flicks and great location backgrounds of NYC and other cities during the Season 2 GARGOYLES World Tour. The characters [even the villains and at least one minor character] grow and change unlike most afternoon cartoon shows. The complete story arc of this great show should be available to both those of us who remember it fondly and to a new generation who will discover it and be caught up in the interplay of GARGOYLES' characters.",1403395200,3,1182,4.606635071090047
8272992,5,B001993Y7W,"Seriously, Disney, this needs to be released now. I need to complete my collection immediately.
