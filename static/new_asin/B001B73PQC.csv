3484546,2,B001B73PQC,"I love Steve Harvey from his beginnings. The way he speaks and curses gives the comedy a really funny twist. But this time he is way to deep into religion, which means he doesn't curses and only talks about religion.",1361404800,,216,4.425

If youve watched any of his other standups then this one is showcasing where he is now in his comedy and in his life. Im sorry but this is one of the funniest things hes Ever done this is by far the one that makes me laugh the hardest and the longest. Steve is taking care of business. But you have to have really followed him for you to get the benefit of what hes saying. Oh yea and he is def.. still trippin!!!!,1337212800,,507,3.980392156862745

3484572,4,B001B73PQC,Steve  Harvey is one of my all time favorite  Comedians.  i have always dug  his takes and he cracks me up a whole lot.  he is very versatile and keeps it moving.  he doesn't miss a beat.  he  ain't lost a thing  and he keeps it real.he is far more funnier than that kermitt the frog jive turkey Katt Williams.kevin hart  can't hang with Steve Harvey on stage either.,1326758400,,367,4.188405797101449
3484573,5,B001B73PQC,"It's hard to imagine Christian and comedy in one video, but Steve Harvey is the master. He makes fun of the people at his church as well as people who are ""OVER saved.""

3484574,5,B001B73PQC,"the hilarity of this dvd is overwhelming, and shockingly inexpensive. jokes on you, it was practically free for me though! he might have taken his race back based on his overall content, but it had to have that much edge to be as entertaining as it was. this disc will be totally destroyed, lol...",1322179200,,297,4.518518518518518

3484576,5,B001B73PQC,"Those who don't like Steve Harvey fall into two camps; (1) the obvious, they simply don't find him funny and (2) they disagree with him so vehemently on issues such as race, religion, and politics that they automatically deem him ""unfunny."" Recently, I stumbled on Steve Harvey's early 90s standup and found it hilarious. Reading up on the man and watching various interviews, I too have qualms about some of the things Harvey says. Regardless, I find him hilariously funny and I found this stand-up special to be comedic gold.

From what I gathered from early material, Harvey has always been religious, but he seems to have become even more religious in the several years leading up to this stand-up special. The Steve Harvey I had grown to like was frequently cussing and incorporating vulgar material into his act, so I had reservations about how funny this would be; especially since he begins the show by mentioning God. Despite being religious, more so than ever, he cusses frequently here and his humor doesn't stretch too far from the humor I liked. Sure he has religious material, and other material that provides a good example of why some people really don't like him, but you'll notice on this feature that even the audience quiets down through some of it. Some viewers will have issues with Harvey when he discusses voting for Barack Obama solely due to his race, but I didn't find any of his material offensive or disagreeable enough to warrant branding the entire special ""unfunny.""

Over 90 minutes Harvey covers an eclectic array of material, beginning with his complaints about interviewing Michael Clarke Duncan on his radio show and finding that Duncan was appearing in a remake of Planet of the Apes. From there, he discusses his children wanting dreadlocks and tattoos, his family (and how he doesn't like them), Barack Obama, a trip to Africa, and more. What makes Harvey such an effective comedian is his mastery of various comedic forms. He has hilarious delivery, amusing facial expressions; his humor can appeal to those both smart and dumb, both white and black. While he may be a flawed human being (to some), he's an undeniably brilliant comedian.

His jokes about his niece and her ""ghetto"" wedding are brilliant and laugh-out-loud funny. This tirade is arguably the funniest part of the show. Some of his monologues are admittedly lengthy and do seem to stretch on a tad bit too long, but few comedians could do stand-up for 90 minutes straight and be consistently entertaining and funny for that amount of time. If you like Harvey and can overcome any bias you may have about him; this is a high-quality stand-up release with some remarkably funny material. He's a changed man, but Steve Harvey is still trippin' and still funny as hell.

He sounded more like DL Hughley than Steve Harvey!  So if you like the DL brand of comedy..have at it.  Nothing clever or original in his material.",1308787200,,320,5.196078431372549

I don't care if someone curses or not,I found the ghetto wedding bit funny and his talk about His sons wanting Dread Locks or tattoos etcera. However when he got political and his reasoning was he voted just to vote for someone skin's color made him as ""Ig-Nant"" as he says as the next person or more,I ""Hope"" He does not vote for the same mistake again based on one's skin,If it were about that I would have never voted for anyone who did not have my name or similar or skin tone.",1303344000,2,641,4.440677966101695

Sounds like something he put together to meet a deadline or some kind of performance obligation. Some jokes were hilarious like his addressing his niece on the phone and the convo w/his wife. I would have given it 2 or 2.5 stars for expecting better from this iconic comedian (no sarcasm intended) but I gave it 3 because I know die hards will get a kick out of it.",1282262400,,459,4.2272727272727275
3484587,5,B001B73PQC,I actually attended this tapin at the NJPAC center and if you think that the video was funny you should have been at the show. The dvd was great. Steve is a piece of work and a true King of Comedy.,1279670400,2,197,3.8292682926829267
3484588,4,B001B73PQC,"This is Steve Harvey at his absolute best: crude, witty, observant, politically incorrect and brutally honest. This is a huge step-up from his last performance (Don't trip...).

This show is side-splittingly funny. I had bought this dvd with plenty of trepidation, given the disappointments I've suffered at Harvey's faltering performances in recent times. My trepidation seemed to be realised early on when he started talking about the woman who questioned whether it was acceptable for her to wipe her fat hubby's bottom. In my opinion, he went on for too long on that subject and that was probably what deprived him of the fifth star in my rating.

Once he got started though, there was no letting up. He brought the house down with laugh-a-minute kind of humour. His style is quite narrative and fairly uncomplicated. He manages to string 2 or 3 jokes per sentence. My favourite piece is the one about his ghetto niece, her ghetto boyfriend, and their ghetto wedding. This is the pinnacle of his performance of the night.

All other subjects were tackled with intelligent hilarity. This is my favourite disc by Steve. I seriously recommend this dvd to all fans of comedy.",1278979200,,1175,4.924242424242424

When he say he will tear your mouth off....he means it.  We were hurting behind Steve Harvey.  I plan on buying a second DVD to send to my daughter so she can see it.  Steve is absolutely the funniest guy I've seen.  He's real and it's all about life and the things we do and say.

Scatalogical humor is part and parcel of all Steve Harvey's routines.  If you don't like jokes about bodily functions, Steve is not your man. Sure dog lovers will hate the bit about Michael Vick, but comedians have the right to their own personal opinions too.  He was making a political point about the disparate jails terms for blacks and whites, not a comment on dog treatment.

3484594,5,B001B73PQC,"Steve Harvey has always been funny to me from the radio to the tv show to the celebration of gospel. Now when people started to get mad at Steve for the comment he made relevant to Michael Vick, I think that people really didn't understand the comment. He was making a comparison of the Michael Vick case to the Sean Bell shooting. He simple implied that Michael was charged with dog fighting and sent to prison, but seven NYPD detectives kill Sean Bell and get sent home.

  Three men were shot at 50 times and one was killed....
  Now who's the sickening one?

When mentioning Barack Obama in the movie he stated that a guy asked him why he was voting for him and he replied, ""because he's black"". Then Steve stated, ain't that the reason you ain't voting for him?""

  I can relate to that as for I live in a very Predominately white town

3484596,1,B001B73PQC,"I used to watch the sitcom ""The Steve Harvey Show"" and think that Steve Harvey was a funny comedian until I saw this on TV the other night. Well, part of it because I turned it off in disgust after a while. I was shocked and sickened to hear his comments on the Michael Vick dog fighting/tortuing case. Instead of showing outrage and condemnation of Vick's vile acts, he PRAISED him and made fun of his sickening crime. He made light of Vick's violent and hateful torture and killing of those dogs. I couldn't believe my ears when he actually said, ""---- them dogs! Let the boy PLAY!""  Yes, that's what he actually said. he was ENCOURAGING his audience to be cruel to animals. I was shocked to see some of them were actually laughing and applauding and all excited about the garbage Harvey was spewing. Sad to see, even though there will always be evil in the world, it looked like there was a fair share of it in Harvey's audience by the reactions I saw to his disgusting comments. I will NEVER in my life watch any show with this guy in it. I will never buy products that sponsor any of his shows. He also said that when the news of that story broke out he had to lie on his radio show and say, ""Ohhh poor dogs"" which he laughed about and scoffed at saying he HAD to lie about his real feelings and say that because he ""has sponsors"".

3484641,1,B001B73PQC,"I've been a fan of Steve Harvey for years and ""split time"" listening to his and Tom Joyner's morning shows.  As a big fan of stand up comedy I eagerly purchased this video the day it was released.  Unfortunately I did not find it as entertaining as some of his earlier work.  The bathroom humor was way too much and his ""scenarios"" tended to run a little long.  How long can you milk the vacation or niece wedding pieces?  If you really want to laugh at some Steve Harvey stuff then check out his very early video from the 1990s:  One Man Show.  This one will make you laugh until you cry as he covers material like the difference between blacks and whites--hilarious but never mean spirited.  By itself the jokes about how blacks and whites ""do"" their weekends and handle getting fired are worth the cost of the video.  And his interpretation of his church lady creation ""Mrs. Odell"" will have you falling over with laughter.  His performance as the host of the 2000 tour and movie, ""The Kings of Comedy"" was also superb to the ""Still Trippin"" DVD.  And if you can locate a very early stand up piece--early 1990's--where the talks about Susan Smith and O. J. Simpson--then by all means you've gotten Steve Harvey at the top of his game.  Let's hope that with his future work he gets back to the comedy and routines that have made him a household name and deservant of the title, King of Comedy.",1233705600,,1395,4.448818897637795

Hilarious in that you have tears in your eyes from laughing so hard, but then, a major thud comes when he gets political, as our economy is NOT something I want to hear about when I'm wanting to laugh.  Putting down the present government and all that political stuff just isn't funny and the audience was unmoved as well.  Stick to comedy Steve and stay away from the current day state of the economy and you will keep us all laughing. Still love him, but disappointed in this one ...",1230336000,,731,4.214285714285714

I think that Mr. Harvey is a very talented guy, but this dvd did not do it for me and I was quite disappointed in it.  He never did finish his last joke.  It was a waste of my money.
