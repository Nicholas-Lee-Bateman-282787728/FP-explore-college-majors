2372645,2,B000A6T244,It was a disappointment because it didn't follow the Zane Grey story and instead took a repetitive plot from the B westerns of that time. Even Robert Mitchum couldn't save it.,1372550400,,175,4.67741935483871
2372646,3,B000A6T244,"This  movie was the first in a new Zane Grey series  by RKO and,for my money ,rates as the best of the lot thanks in tha main to a charismatic performance by Robert Mitchcum ,billed as Bob Mitchum on the credits of the picture.

He plays Jim Lacey ,dubbed Nevada by ""Julie""(played with conviction by Anne Jeffrey ,whose live he saves by reining in a team of runaway horses .Jim heads for the Comstock lode where he hopes to strike it rich .The Lode appears to be worthless but two corrupt businessmen -played by Craig Reynolds and Harry Woods know different. They know that the mineral being uncovered that seems worthless actually bears silver and are buying up claims for a song while concealing the facts from the miners .When it seems a homesteader is about to expose the deception they ambush and kill him ,fixing the blame on Nevada .He narrowly escapes lynching thanks to his two sidekicks (Guinn Big Boy Williams and Richard Martin).He sets out to unmask the real killers ,but still finds time to romance the late homesteaders comely daughter (Nancy Gates)

The movie is well directed especially in the frequent action scenes by Edward Killy and it looks more expensive than it actually was .Its a B Movie given an A movie shine and gloss

Peformances are good especially from Mitchum and Anne Jeffreys as the tough but likeable heroine and this is a painless way for lovers of the Western to pass a pleasant hour or so.",1197244800,11,1428,4.628458498023716
2372647,3,B000A6T244,"This review refers to the DVD ""Nevada"" from the Zane Grey series. ""Nevada"" is the first starring role of Robert Mitchum after he was promoted from playing the heavy in Hopalong Cassidy Westerns. He would make another B-western, ""West of the Pecos"" before he was promoted to ""A"" features.

Although Nevada looks like a B-Western (it even has Richard Martin in the role of Chito Gonzales Bustamante Rafferty, the role he would play alongside Tim Holt in the popular Tim Holt series, the plot line of ""Nevada"" has some elements that are not normally found in B-Westerns like those of Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, or Hopalong Cassidy.

Robert Mitchum plays 'Nevada', a cowboy who isn't proud of being a ""twenty-dollar-a-month cowboy"". He goes to a mining town and resorts to gambling to improve his lot, and that's how he comes by his troubles. He gets framed for a murder he did not commit and while he clears his name he also helps develop the Comstock Lode. Excellent supporting role from Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams and Anne Jeffreys.

Three stars.",1153267200,18,1040,4.798882681564246
2372648,3,B000A6T244,"This Robert Mitchum's first feature film.  RKO hired Mitch, the original king of cool, for its Cowboy freatures when Tim Holt went into the service.  Interesting to Tim Holt fans will be the appearence of Richard Martin in the role that made him almost famous.  Richard Martin first played Chito Jose Bustamante Gonzales Rafferty in the World War 2 movie Bombardier. He would go on to play that same character 32 times, mostly in Tim Holt Westerns.  This film is his first western, however, under that character's name.  He would play it one other film along side Mitchum in the West of the Pecos. The Chito Rafferty character also appeared alongside James Warren in Wanderer of the Wasteland. One wonders how a character that first appeared in a modern war flick ended up being a longtime sidekick in Westerns.  It would not be until 1947 that the Rafferty character appeared alongside cowboy star Tim Holt in Wild Horse Mesa.  This is not a great film but it is a fun film.  It is interesting to see Mitchum in his first feature.",1125014400,15,1031,4.657458563535911
8075260,4,B000A6T244,"The Plot had no resemblance to Zane Grey's book, not that justice could be done in the time available.  But never the less, the movie was entertaining.",1506211200,,151,4.592592592592593
8075261,5,B000A6T244,"It's wonderful.
Excellent case.  DVD easily pops right in and out.
So clear a picture that I could make out the stuntman, Ben Johnson, each time he was on.  I loved that.
Well worth the money.
I got an all region DVD player to play it on.
Now, for a copy like that of ""The Fighting Gringo"" (1939), The Gallant Legion"" (1948), Disney""s ""Ride a Northbound Horse"" (1969) and on and on.
Thank you.",1497139200,,393,4.297297297297297

8075263,4,B000A6T244,"For a B-western, this movie has excellent production values and a fine story by Zane Grey.  Mitchum's first starring role.  Richard Martin is already playing the Chito role he would continue in the Tim Holt series.  Nancy Gates, at age 18, has a nice role as the second female lead after Anne Jeffreys.  Ben Johnson is seen briefly in the background of the opening saloon gambling scene, and he doubles for Mitchum in action sequences.  Image and sound quality are just fine.  I enjoyed the movie and am pleased with owning it.",1424217600,,527,4.673913043478261

8075266,4,B000A6T244,"One could not tell if it was the first movie he made but he was introduced as Bob Mitchum and that never happened again in other movies that I am aware of. Having said that one also could not tell because while lookinfg younger he reacted as he has always done. Yes he can assume to be angry, sinister and loving but Mitchum had a natural talent for acting. As his career started he would turn down offers just because he would have to actually be in the movies too long a time. More than 5 hours & he would decline to take the part & then they would offer him more money. He had a great philosophy on life and he never deviated from it.  One wonders then why he did WINDS OF WAR & then WAR & REMEMBRANCE which he gave a lot of hours to these two miniseries. He turned down PATTON because he would have to put in too much of his time. He told them ""get George Scott whom I might say refused the Oscar for it. I am sure Mitchum would not have turned his back on an enemy. Through Mitchum's career he received many accolades for his acting ability. He should have received an Oscar for that one as he did such a great job. His speaking voice was very manly & he could also sing but more like calypso music which I do not care for. He had land in California and I believe they bred horses but he would have nothing to do with decisions as he left that up to his wife. He rarely read a script before they were ready to start. He would read the script & was ready to go. He knew all his parts & also all the other parts. He graduated from high school at 14 & was valedictorian. I am getting away from NEVADA but it was a ""B"" movie & not many known actors but surprisingly his personality was obvious re: doing things only with honesty & integrity, being honorable with others. This is apparent in this movie & one really could not tell it was his first. He could never understand how he would wok only when he wanted to & still get paid such huge amounts. Get ROBERT MITCHUM; IN HIS OWN WORDS.",1415318400,,1988,4.071428571428571
8075267,1,B000A6T244,Do not purchase this movie from Amazon.  Video quality is terrible; screen picture is constantly jumping.  Does not advertise that this is a black and white movie.  Problem is that you don't know the issues until you open the box and put the movie in the DVD player - too late to return then.  Poor advertising from Amazon!!,1412553600,2,324,4.5344827586206895
