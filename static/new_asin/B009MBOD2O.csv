8542989,4,B009MBOD2O,"I loved this Anime and would like to buy it soon, but I am confused as to why it is Rated G. I believe I remember there being some cussing and most definitely nudity.",1420243200,,166,3.911764705882353

8542991,5,B009MBOD2O,"If you are a fan of the manga, to the point where you feel very strongly about the storyline and characterizations
presented therein, and you have somehow not been exposed to the anime, you may feel a bit of a let down. It
depends on what you are expecting. If you are expecting a fluffy, fan-service driven, harem comedy that has
only the barest (pun not intended) resemblance to the much more character and plot driven story of the
manga, well, that's what we've got here.
For those unfamiliar with either, the plot isn't that complicated - slacker student Tsukune flunks out on his
high school entrance exams but gets accepted by a rather strange institution that turns out to be an
academy for monsters. Where he 's the only human. And where humans are - skyzzzzzk - killed on sight
in order to protect the ""secret"". So Tsukune's up the proverbial creek. He makes first-episode friends
and shares his unfortunate liability with sweet, good girl/vampiress Moka, who has a second personality
as kick-butt, bad girl/vampiress Moka. This comes in handy on those every-episode occaisions where
Tsukune's life is in danger. Sooooo which Moka does Tsukune love best? Or does he prefer the busty harpy,
the goth-cool ice girl, or the nymphet witchling? That's basically the plot.
Every negative remark made in every other review posted on Amazon regarding this anime is absolutely
true. It throws the manga out the window. Tsukune's character undergoes near zero development but
instead remains a maddeningly irritating can't-we-all-be-friends Pollyanna who constantly needs his
tuckus saved from monsters who don't feel the love. The fan service is blatant to the point of being
ridiculous. By Season 2 we've got open lesbian groping and full topless nudity. This is not a cute, bubbly,
comedy for your little girl.
Saying that, I did, you will notice, give the series 5 stars.
I like it.
No, I don't know why exactly.
I guess it does have a kind of corny charm to it. The dumb schmuck stuck in a school full of monsters idea
is just a tad different enough from the zillion other harem series just like it to make it interesting.
The lead characters develop enough of a chemistry that they manage to carry the lame plot, so you
find yourself actually wondering which Moka our ""hero"" will confess the L-word to.
I've seen every episode of both seasons about ten times. What can I say?
Now, saying that, I did opt for the less expensive, subtitle only, collection, that, no, I did not purchase
through Amazon. So, yeah,  I like it. But I didn't spend a lot of money on it.
  The collection actually shown here is the same Malaysian-licensed version that I have and is available
from several reputable dealers for well under twenty dollars. I own a good number of these imports,
including some excellant series that will probably never be picked up for distribution in the US, and
I have found the overall quality to be just as good as the products marketed by the big US distributors.",1392422400,,2979,4.76937984496124
