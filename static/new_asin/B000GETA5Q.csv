8131013,5,B000GETA5Q,"Great series! Great mix of interviews, re-enactments and actual footage. Amazing forensics! Creepy and dumb criminals. I have watched this series over and over and I never get bored of it. If you are a fan of true crime this is a MUST WATCH SERIES!!!!.",1273968000,,252,4.622222222222222
8131014,1,B000GETA5Q,Don't waste your money. This show is crap. I couldn't even get through the first DVD because it was so boring. I was expecting a show in comparison of the forensic shows found on what use to be Court TV. It will be going to the recycle bin to trade for something better.,1258416000,,270,4.113207547169812
8131015,5,B000GETA5Q,"As a fan of forensics, investigation, true crime and detective programs, I was completely satisfied with Forensic Investigators.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had not seen any of these programs, because this is a series from an Australian Television Network.  I have seen the First 48, Cold Case Files, Forensic Files, Investigative Detectives, Autopsy and a host of others, this show is along those lines and is presented in a familiar way, which includes reenactments, police footage, interviews, photographs etc.  One thing I did enjoy particularly is that there were many interviews conducted or surveillance that was presented as well as reenactments.  It's all here from the beginning of the crime scene and the discovery of the bodies to the end, which familiarly includes the arrest and subsequent sentences.  There are quite a fews crimes in this particular series that were unique, including the Stephen Dempsey case which features a killer whom hunted his victims from a distance, using a bow and arrow, and the Milosevic Family, the same killer being responsible for the death of 6 members of the same family, several years apart.  Some fun and different things that are really side bar material is censorship:  the Aussies don't censor the F word or any other such language from their episodes.  The accents, language (slang) and scenery are all new, as I've only watched American Cable shows.  If you are a fan of shows like this, you will enjoy this.  The Aussie police officers are passionate and intelligent and enjoyable, committed to bringing closure to some really horrible offenses.",1218499200,13,1616,5.087121212121212
