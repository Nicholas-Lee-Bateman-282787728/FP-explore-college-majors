8526160,4,B0088QRWJU,This is very good to follow along while practicing. It helps you get an idea of the proper pacing for the form.,1371686400,,111,4.090909090909091
8526161,4,B0088QRWJU,Easy to follow the movements and with detailed instructions. I would like to further purchase the series.  Clear pictures with 2 sides that showing front and side for detailed movements.,1367625600,,186,5.2
8526162,3,B0088QRWJU,"The disc only had a few exercises on it but because the exercises are done so slow and with such deliberation they filled up the entire time. Anyone could just as easily read how to do the exercises without seeing the video. What is emphaized in the video is how slow and deliberate the exercises are done. (When moving the feet they were not really lifted off the floor but were moved, very slowly, toe then heel until the new position was reached.) The video was well made but you can do without unless you have some extra money to spare.",1358467200,,540,4.356435643564357
