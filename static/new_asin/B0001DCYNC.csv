8010524,5,B0001DCYNC,"I looked for this movie a long time, I was so glad to finally find it here!  This is an older Disney movie I watched several times on the Disney channel with my mother when she was ill.  We both loved it, seeing the boys think of others and give when they landed on the hidden cash - it was heartwarming.  No wonder I wanted it to watch again!",1387929600,,343,3.9420289855072466
8010525,5,B0001DCYNC,"I've been looking EVERYWHERE for this movie. I used to watch it when I lived in Maryland all the time on the Disney channel. It's been 13 years since I've seen it, and every now and again I'll think of it and try to find it on the internet/Youtube/Netflix/Amazon Prime/Hulu Plus/Pirate Bay. Could never find it! I bought it used for 25$ (plus shipping) and it was in AWESOME condition. I just watched it and still think it was so adorable :) I even cried at one part. I'm very glad that I decided to buy it. Can't wait to show my kids this movie (well, when my fiance and I have a kid;)

I just think it's funny...when I watched it on TV it was called ""Angels In The Attic"", not ""The Robinhood Gang."" And, I find it odd that the picture of the two boys with the dog on the cover, is not the boys (or the dog that was only in the movie for a short scene). Doesn't make any sense. That's why I was always hesitant on getting it before. Not like it's the sellers, or amazons fault. Just weird how the pic isn't Brad and Frankie in the movie, haha.",1362009600,4,1044,4.092682926829268

8010527,5,B0001DCYNC,"A few years ago I saw ""Angels in the Attic""  by the Robin Hood Gang and thought it was such a great teaching tool for giving.  I have not seen it anywhere on TV or for sale anywhere.  I ordered it on Amazon.com  for my grandchildren for Christmas at the last minute not expecting to receive it before Christmas.  I was so thrilled to get it 3 days before Christmas, just in time to watch it on Christmas day after the dust settled.  It is a great movie.",1295827200,,453,4.090909090909091
