8266905,1,B0017QMXIS,"This music video scores well on a one out of three rating: It is beautiful since it is filmed through the mists at Torre del Lago,
Puccini's area of residence, but the video sings flat due to awful
acting, while juxtaposing itself into rehearsls by the amateurish
Scottish Opera, and the story itself is a bad soap opera.  If you
want to see and hear ""Turandot,"" find Franco Corelli's video version,
and if you want a better presentation of Puccini's rustic
marital problems with his wife Elvira, read the book--skip this mess.
