8259438,5,B0015QT784,"This was my favorite show when I was little, we taped the episodes off the air and I watched them so many times I practically wore out the VHS.  It holds up and is still delightful, some 22ish years later.  It's an early 90s hour-long family drama (with plenty of comic relief and a surprising streak of feminism) set in Medieval England.  I loved all of the characters, but tomboyish Eleanor was my favorite.  Let us have Covington Cross, at long last!",1390521600,7,453,4.487804878048781
8259439,5,B0015QT784,"I'm hoping that with the success of Game of Thrones that Convington Cross will be released (all 13 episodes- not just the 7 that aired) on Blu Ray and DVD soon. Great locations, production design, and acting along with fun scripts made this a favorite of mine. Even after all these years, I'm still checking Amazon for its arrival!",1308441600,5,331,4.627118644067797
8259440,5,B0015QT784,This was a great series. Filled with action and fun and makes your really think. It is the story of a British nobility. The  characters are somewhat predictable but very likable. They are highly moral and well loved by their people. The stories are both interesting and funny and the production values are higher than Wizards and Warriors. For some reason they took it off very quickly. It is I recorded it on SVHS tape so at least I have the ones that aired.,1268092800,3,459,4.464285714285714
8259441,4,B0015QT784,"I have a 3 DVD set of all thirteen, yes, thirteen episodes, plus commentaries. I bought it on ebay a few years ago, after having searched for years, even to the point of contacting ABC for the film, or posters, scripts, ets. My fascination was due to the location. Allington Castle was my ancestral home. It is in County Kent, on the banks of the Medway River, not too awfully far from London.

I enjoyed each episode, especially looking out for the castle in the background.  I'm told that all the exterior shots were done at Allington, and shots in the Great Hall were done there too.  All other smaller rooms and scenes were filmed at other locations and sets.

Who knows, maybe a resurgency of medieval stuff will bring it back, restored to HD, and put out again on DVD.  Mine has fairly poor video, as it was burned to DVD from a VHS recording, but commercials were edited out, except the annoying ""Place Trailer Here"" near the end of each episode.  Ione Skye was my favorite; I've always adored her!",1246233600,10,1005,4.4945054945054945
8259442,5,B0015QT784,"One of the few shows that keeps you riveted to your screen even though it is so predictable but once in awhile a funny wit and you were conquered.  All the ingredients are there.  A loving family of brothers and a sole sister (poor girl), deeply caring about one another.  It is one of the few series that has not come out yet in DVD for which I long for.",1230595200,9,355,4.042857142857143
8259443,4,B0015QT784,"I was 12 when the show debuted and immediately loved every minute.  In hindsight, I must admit that it had flaws, but that didn't make the show any less enjoyable.  The seven episodes that were aired seemed to combine a modern family with another age.  Regrettably, Covington Cross was felled, not by a crossbow, but by Ross Perot.  I, for one, long for the day when the series comes to DVD and I can visit with the Grey family once more.",1217980800,5,438,4.37037037037037
8259444,5,B0015QT784,Great cast including Ione Skye and Glenn Quin.  I remember that there was a preview for an episode that never aired. The show was a lot of fun !!,1217462400,6,145,4.0
8259445,5,B0015QT784,"This is one of those little shows that had a lot of potental, but due to bad scheduling was knocked off before its time!  It was very funny and full of action and romance.  I wish they would put out shows like this that we enjoyed while they were on.  Another good suggestion would be ""Wizards and Warriors"".",1207526400,18,308,4.275862068965517
