1260933,5,B0000399WM,"I've never really cared too much for Chris Rock as an actor-- I find most of his cinema characters to be rather obnoxious. Fortunately, he does have his redeeming qualities: I loved many of his `Saturday Night Live' sketches, and (most importantly) he does one helluva standup act!
There are times when he's a bit too repetitive and draws the joke out for a bit too long, but otherwise I found Chris Rock's ""Bigger & Blacker"" to be even better than his last standup special, ""Bring The Pain""! Once again, he sets his sights- and puts some hilariously subversive spins- on those wonderfully touchy topics plaguing us today: relationships, parental responsibility, and race relations. He even adds a few new topics- taxes, Jerry's kids, and doctors not really curin' anything- to his list, both of which I found to be a riot. So even if you ain't a big fan of Chris Rock, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by his `Bigger & Blacker' routine! I'm not gonna make any guarantees, however...

This guy has a humor that is not touched by any comedian today.  he touches the human experience with the sharpest of wits and dices all our silliness into silliness.  I watch this one over and over.",980208000,5,261,4.18
1260936,5,B0000399WM,"This was just an absolute delight to watch. Chris Rock comes at you with  topic after topic and always blends everything smoothly together(like the  Ricky Martin livin' la vita loca and the robotusim jokes throughout the  night). This is a top notch performance from a top notch comedian. Even if  you're not a Chris Rock fan you must respect his work on ""Bigger &  Blacker"". His presence on the stage is incredible and his performance  is even more spectacular. Chris Rock is a very intelligent comedian that  shows you a vision of the world we tend to hide or ignore.  After seeing  this show so many times I started to ask myself how can he remember and  deliever his act so smoothly. It seems like as if Chris Rock is having a  regular conversation with the crowd as he performs on stage. Chris tackles  enough issues in this show to have everyone (black or white)to relate to  the material in some way. There is no doubt about it, this DVD is great and  if you didn't see it on HBO or home video then you need to pick up this  DVD. The price on this DVD is good but the show itself is great. A Must  have for true fans of comedy. ( intellectual or silly )",968025600,16,1160,4.276497695852535

1260990,5,B0000399WM,Chris Rock normally isn't all that funny to me.  Probably because he seems to be into political humor which isn't funny to me.  But I really liked this one.,1402185600,,156,4.344827586206897

1261002,5,B0000399WM,Chris Rock is a very funny comedian and the materail was funny when I was in high school still funny today.  The man isn't afraid to speak his mind about any and all topics to make his fans laugh out loud.  This was one of the best shows he has done until Never Scared in my viewpoint.  So if you enjoy was old school humor from about 2000 then pick this dvd up and enjoy joke after joke on mutiple issues.  You won't regret buying it as long as your a fan of Chris Rock. I bought it because of his talk of president Bill.,1338768000,,522,3.942857142857143

1261009,5,B0000399WM,"Rock is perhaps the sharpest stand-up working today (though Carlin is still trenchant, to say the least), and this is his peak. Crafting a  well-nigh perfect performance using his pissed-off ghetto persona, Rock hits the bull's eye again and again here. His delivery is razor-sharp, the material pretty much flawless; this will still be hilarious in fifty years.

  I've seen hundreds of stand-up routines; this is the only one I've watched over a dozen times. It never seems to grow old...I don't know how it's always funny, but it is. When I've got to either laugh immmediately or die of post-modern deconstructivist meta-ironic brainache, this is the pick. The cd is nowhere near as good, different takes on the same material but without the edge.

  Five stars, no doubt.",1188864000,,775,4.961240310077519
1261010,4,B0000399WM,"The Doug E. Fresh intro perfectly sets the mood for the frantic and energetic Chris Rock.  Bigger & Blacker is an HBO production filmed in the Apollo Theater and is brilliant satire from the perspective of an African-American.

Rock lays the smack down on topics such as school violence, gun control, irresponsible parents, neglected fathers, infidelity, bigotry, and the poor state of health care.  His assertions are blunt, bold, and are fired from point-blank: ""A man is only as faithful as his options"", ""Men lie but women are much bigger liars"", ""Blacks and whites have little to complain about, consider the state of Native Americans"".

All of Rock's material is solid and most of it is intelligent and thought-provoking.  He slips into crudeness only briefly as he suggests that the blind be assigned to midgets instead of seeing-eye dogs and when he mentions his contempt for women that don't provide oral servicing.  Also, he picks on white people a little, but it is not really funny like when Richard Pryor teased white people.  These minor flaws are certainly not deal breakers.

Rock is providing a solid hour of comedy here.  He has a superb rapport with his audience and his delivery is very good overall with only a couple instances of repeating himself or otherwise stalling as he gathers his thoughts.  This is an adult show and profanity is used liberally, but not quite what I would consider gratuitously.  Overall this is a very good show that all fans of standup comedy, should consider viewing.  Chris Rock deserves to go home to the big piece of chicken (inside joke-watch the show).",1188086400,6,1607,4.88929889298893
1261011,5,B0000399WM,"Well, I cannot get enough of Mr. Rock so I took a look at this video and will be watching it a few more times in the future. Like all of Chris Rock's standup performances this one is totally brilliant. If everyone in society talked as freely about race, sex, and people as Chris Rock does then the United States would be a far better place. He is magnificently, wondrously, and electrically politically incorrect and we should appreciate him for it. Rock is far more valuable than five thousand rebellious commentators writing articles for 24 hours a day in the attempt to destroy PC. His essential theme is ""people are people"" even if you're Bill Clinton. That we pretend otherwise is our own pathology. Thank God for Chris Rock--at least someone has the guts to stand up and say what he wants.",1187049600,3,795,4.605633802816901

1261018,5,B0000399WM,"Clocking in at just over one hour

and filmed in Harlem's legendary Apollo Theater,

BIGGER & BLACKER is a hilarious 1999 comedy

performance by Chris Rock.

It features 12 bits that straddle the fence between

conventional jokes and social commentary.

Hot off his career-saving ""Bring The Pain"" performance,

here Rock swaggers across the stage in a shiny leather suit

and charms the pants off of this mostly middle class

African American audience.

Angst-ridden white teenage boys,

black party girl single mothers,

gay bashers and fat women --

in BIGGER & BLACKER no one is safe

from Chris Rock's razor sharp observations.

Espousing 1950s era middle class values

to a very appreciative crowd,

Rock here advocates lots of stuff

that would horrify the politically correct among us.

With humor he reveals he's against gun control,

critical of the Clintons and fed up with

black political leaders.

And yet in the next breath Rock highlights

the surprising dangers of homophobia,

the gangster nature of the I.R.S.

and the fraud of popular celebrity-friendly charities.

Having said that, not all of BIGGER & BLACKER is

political in nature.

The DVD features a brief performance by rap legend Slick Rick

and there are two very funny bits about

male-female relationships.

Though BIGGER & BLACKER isn't very long

and doesn't offer much in the way of special features,

it is a very funny DVD

and should be a must-see for anyone who loves

a good political incorrect laugh.

1261019,5,B0000399WM,"I'm a big fan of Chris Rock because he tells it like it is. His take with finding the cure on aids. As he states ""the money is not in the cure the money is in the medicine thats how you get paid on the comeback."" I also like when he talks about how other's say that were losing to affirmative action and Chris says if there losing who's winning because it's not us. Chris goes on to say ""have you driven around this M''f lately, there's not a white man in this room that would change places with me, none of you and I'm rich"". That's how good it is to be white. Chris Rock is awesome and I'm behind 100%. THANKS CHRIS ROCK.",1146528000,,623,3.992

1261021,3,B0000399WM,I recieved the DVD in a timely fashion and it was in perfect working condition.,1138579200,,79,4.333333333333333
1261022,5,B0000399WM,"This movie is FUNNY!!!!! It is Chris Rock raw and politically uncorrect. He gives us his take on Columbine and crazy white boys under 21, the Clinton-Lewinski scandal, relationships, gays in the military and pharmaceuticals. My favorite sketch is by far ""Aint No Money in  the Cure"". The theme is that the government does not sponsor cures to diseases like AIDS or Cancer because ""the money's in the medicine"". He says that they'll only ""fix it so that you can LIVE with it.""

I find myself watching this over and over!!! I've seen Never Scared but this one is soo much better. In Never Scared, some of the jokes go a little far even for me and I'm a big fan of Chris'. In Bigger Blacker, Chris is saying things that we all say (just maybe not out loud). The comedy is more approachable and less offensive (except perhaps the segment on midgets).

Watch this and you'll find out why Chris loves fat, black women, whether men or women tell the biggest lies, why Hillary contributed to the Clinton-Lewinski scandal, why we should not blame music and movies for kids gone wild, and the truth about the government and pharmaceuticals.

Bigger Blacker is 65 minutes of fabulous fun!",1132617600,6,1177,4.644230769230769
1261023,5,B0000399WM,"Do not make the mistake of not buying this dvd. I bought it early this year (2005)after seeing Rock's 4th HBO special, Never Scared. Since then I have watched it 8 times and it never ceases to send me into rapturous laughter. If ever Pryor had a successor, Rock is it, but better.

Chris takes a satirical look at life and the general struggles we all do battle with in our everyday existence. From poking fun at the gun culture in America to irresponsible parenting, racism and Clinton's impeachment, Rock will have you choking with laughter. I can never forget his take on Newt Gingrich's motives for having president Clinton impeached. He manages to slip in the unadulterated truth with some profane poignancy. There is a good number of expletives used, but all are cleverly worked into the jokes to give them greater clout. His irreverence for hypocrisy and his political incorrectness are reminiscent of Pryor in his prime. Only, Rock is more relevant and inspirational.

This is the second best stand-up act I have ever seen (and I have seen at least 200 from around the world by the top acts of various generations) behind Never Scared- also by Chris Rock.",1131926400,2,1163,4.752475247524752

1261025,5,B0000399WM,"Have this DVD and seen the special many times over, very hilarious material.",1117065600,3,76,4.923076923076923
1261026,2,B0000399WM,"what a load of crap,maybe it would be better without the retards in the crowd whooping and hollering at everything he said,some of the stuff is funny but all it does is make you smile not laugh.",1116720000,4,194,4.27027027027027
1261027,1,B0000399WM,"This DVD was not what I expected. I hadn't seen Chris Rock on standup before but he sure is alot different than he is on the silver screen. Every other word is the f-word. Maybe he was trying to compensate for the fact that his jokes weren't funny. Definately not something I'd suggest. I would look into some Dave Chappelle, he is animated like Rock and he has good material.",1114905600,6,376,4.385714285714286
1261028,5,B0000399WM,"What makes you laugh? ""Bigger and Blacker"" dishes out the following:

1) Profanity -- quite a bit of it. If you laugh at the mere thought or sound of profanity, buy this DVD. But in reality, the raw language is irrelevant. Watch the intensity of the delivery and pay attention to the ideas surrounding the ""bad"" words.

2) Social/Political Commentary from one man's perspective -- A LOT of it.

Chris Rock, as he continually states either directly or indirectly, is a ""law and order conservative"" (well, mostly order!) and a ""moral"" liberal. His moral liberalism is a bit extreme for most people, but it is refreshingly consistent and counterbalances the traditional notion of ""liberal"" tolerance with the libertarian ideal of being accountable for one's actions. Oh, and by the way, there are no victims in Chris Rock's universe. If you dislike ""Victim"" mentality, you will find it well dismissed here.

3) Social/Racial Commentary from a black man's perspective -- There is a fair amount of this in Bigger and Blacker, but nothing earth shaking. Although he is clearly not pleased to be directly on the negative end of racial profiling, Rock typically redirects his racial commentary into larger themes (violence, hypocrisy, value systems...).

4) About Men and Women -- Who are we, together and apart? These subjects are always fertile ground for comedy. Although he attempts to soften the blows by continued professions of his love for women, Chris's take on women in general is pretty harsh, while not quite so hard, nor as detailed on men. Rock has a clear disdain for absentee fathers, but men get a pass on most of their behaviors -- behaviors that are excused as ""understandable"" (if not necessarily right) attempts to get around intolerable actions of women. Judging by the apparent reaction of the  female members of the audience, Chris puts enough meat on the bones of his contentions to warrant serious contemplation after the laughter.

5) Physical Presence -- Energetic, intense, animated...

6) Limited Exaggerations --  Bigger and Blacker material mostly avoids ""over-""exaggeration while its points are being made, and make no mistake, Chris Rock is trying to make a LOT of points (Rock's latest stand-up effort, ""Never Scared"" drifts more often into realm of over-exaggeration by my account, thus rendering it less enjoyable despite some great ideas).

7) Bonus Points -- A hilarious question is asked about medical science's ability (or lack thereof) to cure major diseases... An observation is given about social security's relevancy to black men... Both of these bonus points strain at the limits of exaggeration, but contain enough weight to make them worthy of an acid laugh or three...

In short, Bigger and Blacker is not light comedy. If you primarily like self- depreciating comedians, Chris Rock is not your man; If you are a diehard of the ""left"" or ""right,"" he is not your man. If you prefer to believe that the world is generally rosy, he is not your man. If, on the other hand, you enjoy exceptional (almost) equal opportunity skewerings of pretenses and prejudices, it doesn't get much better than ""Bigger and Blacker"".",1113091200,13,3152,5.042307692307692
1261029,2,B0000399WM,"This show is just plain boring. It's that simple. Most of his jokes are dumb and sleazy and he complains about some of the dumbest things you can think of. If you don't think the 3 Stooges are funny, then this is not for you. It isn't funny. That's all I should say. It's just dumb stand-up.",1112832000,3,291,4.12280701754386

1261031,1,B0000399WM,"Of course everyone has their own opinion and most of you appear to have liked this, but i find that Chris Rock doesn't relate to a wide audience he talks about people that aren't world wide famous and there are lots of 'insider' gags that some people just won't get unless they know America very well.  I would prefer to watch Eddie Murphy.",1103587200,6,340,4.396825396825397
1261032,5,B0000399WM,"`Bigger And Blacker' is one of the funniest standup routines I have ever seen.  Rock is in his finest hour here, spewing out admonitions on parenting, relationships, childhood, and even the Presidency, while making me laugh until I choked.  His amazingly funny satire brings with it the stinging bite of truth, which in turn makes it all the more laughable.

Generously peppered with the ""F"" word, you certainly won't enjoy his humor if you can't stomach the profanity, not to mention that most of his subjects are in the ""adult"" realm, such as Hilary Clinton's job as First Lady, and why it's easier for women to score.

The part I found the funniest in his routine is his reproach towards parents to take care of their children, using such hilarious statements such as, ""You have to teach your kids more words other than `Mommy be back'"", and the excuses people use to explain away their crimes (Whatever happened to `Crazy'?).

Rock's performance is high energy, satirical, scolding, profane, intelligent, and most of all...hilariously funny.  Even after repeat viewings I still laugh out loud at this performance, one of the best since Eddie Murphy's `Delirious'.  If you are looking for a few side-splitting belly laughs, then pick up a copy of `Bigger And Blacker'.  Enjoy!",1103414400,8,1279,4.94392523364486
1261033,5,B0000399WM,"Amazing stand up... Chris Rock is straight fire, but I wrote this as a reply to ""A stand-up comic ""unjimbobob"" because he seems to actually be a racist. Who are you kidding, Dave Chappelle?! You cant compare the two. If it weren't for people like Rihard Pryor, Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock, Chappelle wouldnt exist. An if you thought C.R. is a racist and takes advantage of the black people white people routine, then how the hell can you not think Pryor was crude,and this is coming from a black man. I loved Pryor, but sometimes his material was shockingly crude, yet funny, and the same could be said for C.R. maybe its bugging you so much because the stuff he says about white pople might be getting under your skin, I don't know. Anyway, not to get off topic, I honestly think you are biased against Chris Rock, and so should keep your hateful views to yourself.

classic stand up material from Rock, especially the Clinton comments and how we men cant escape women throwing themselves at us, which was exactly what happened to Clinton.",1099612800,3,1040,4.591397849462366
1261034,5,B0000399WM,"Rarely do I throw the term Genius out to describe comedy but this show recorded at the Apollo Theater is pure genius.  Chris Rock returns to stand up to deliver a hilarious and stunning comedy show that will shake you up whoever you are.  His take on President Clintons troubles,  old black men,  relationships,  and even Ricky Martin will have you not only roaring with laughter but thinking as well!!!

Of course theres lots of profane language so its not for the little kids....but if you're an adult looking for brash,  wild,  and really thought provoking humor then this is your DVD.  Chris Rock is an absolute genius of Comedy!!!",1097280000,3,635,4.7

He seems to be obssessed with being black!  We get it Chris.  Your black, some people are white, and others are (gasp) LATINO!  Thanks for sharing this amazing news!  I swear, he seems raceist.  So much so it got boring.  I'm white, and some say ""Well, you just don't get it unless your a minorite.""  No, I'm partially minorite, and it's still not funny.  The foirst 10 minutes were hilarious, then after that I was just like SHUT UP!!!!  Stop talking.  Get a new subject.  Pryor did alot of race topics, but he did many things WITH IT.  Chris Rock just is always talking about black people this and black people that.  Pryor talked about white church black church comparisions, bl;ack family white family comparision, white politics black politics comapision, did you ever notice this about (whatever race).  He is clearly the master of the topic of race, not this new guy trying to take over.  Not that he's totally worthless as a comic.  get the CD ""Born Suspect.""

1261038,5,B0000399WM,"I first saw this gem of a stand-up act way back when it was first on HBO, when a friend taped it for me.  I subsequently made more tapes for all my friends, telling them that this is the funniest thing they'll ever see.  I naturally added the DVD to my collection when it was available.  Yes, Chris Rock swears a lot.  A whole lot.  Yes, he's controversial.  Yes, he harpoons everyone--- white, black, politicians, the media, the masses, the medical profession, men, women, and everyone in between.  So?  He's funny, dammit!  He's hilarious!  Unlike Andrew Dice Clay, who used profanity purely to get a laugh (and where is he today?), Chris Rock integrates it in clever, intelligent commentary on current events, interpersonal relationships, and just about every other subject you can imagine.  His dissertations on the Clinton-Lewinski affair, on dead rappers, on family interactions, are priceless.  My favortie?  His insightful, incisive evaluation of the 3 things men want (I won't tell you.  You'll have to get it from him).  Sure, everyone has different ideas of what's funny, but if you aren't afraid of four-letter words (I personally have a hard time keeping them out of my own conversation) and you like scathing wit and appreciate keen observations of modern life and the human condition --- regardless of your race, gender, sexual orientation, etc, etc ---- you should find this side-splittingly, tears-running-down-your-face funny.

I watched ""Bring the Pain"" repeatedly-- I belly laughed every time.  I made my friends watch it.  We'd recite the best bits over and over.  With bigger and blacker, there weren't moments to be taken away.  Sure, it was funny but not resoundingly so.  While I would not argue that C-Rock is this generation's Pryor, this is not his Mudbone.",1078358400,3,480,4.5
1261041,5,B0000399WM,"Forget the editorial review above. There is no weak spot in this hour long presentation. Chris Rock is the most brilliant contemporary comedian I know of and he's at the top of his game in Bigger and Blacker. Let's get real...this is 2004....post Richard Pryor, post Eddie Murphy, Dice Clay etc....four letter words shouldn't be offensive to anyone at this point so it is not a valid argument to say that this wasn't enjoyable because Rock curses too much. Like any great, he can get the laughs without the swearing but this is his special and he comes out with both barrels blazing. The cursing isn't for cursing's sake....this is intelligent, razor-sharp, ADULT comedy. Put the kids to bed and kick back. Like any great satirist, Chris' jokes reflect a probable truth. In regards to his bits on family, love and relationships, I have LIVED his jokes. It's frightening in a funny way and I'm sure I'm not the only one who experienced that sensation of Rock peering into their lives and dragging out all of the dirty laundry. Any aspiring comic writers and stand up comedians need to study this; it's a gem.  Rock did his homework studying Woody Allen and Richard Pryor and it shows. The torch has been passed.",1077494400,6,1210,4.7075471698113205
1261042,1,B0000399WM,"Usually I like controversial artists. But after viewing Chris Rock: Bigger and Blacker (as well as other movies he has ""acted"" in and skits on Saturday Night Live), I feel it inappropriate to call Chris Rock an ""artist"". I would classify him as a ""wannabe"". Chris wants to be funny. Jokes about how the Jerry Lewis telethon is a scam are supposed to be humorous. Telling Jerry to ""make a cripple puppet out of them or somethin'"" is the Chris Rock version of comedy. Suggesting that Robitussin is the cure for child sexual abuse is not really all that clever, it's downright ignorant. In this special, following the pattern of his other ""comic"" appearances, Chris Rock presents himself as the epitamy of arrogance, a man who believes that comedy is built primarily around profanity and not intelligent satirical ideas.",1074297600,8,817,4.884892086330935

Chris Rock is not only the funniest comedian ever,he is also the smartest. His routines include A LOT of social commentary. Most of the stuff he says is true. The beginning of this video is racist and boring,but it picks up and becomes the funniest stand up routine ever. I have to warn you,this video contains ALOT of swearing.
