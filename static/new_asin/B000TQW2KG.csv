8210366,4,B000TQW2KG,"The night I opened this dvd set I started to sense an evil energy
coming from the disks.

So I got up and watched disk one.  The disk was defective so I wasn't able to finish watching it.  But it's about the CIA's remote viewing program and talked about ways to kill people using psychic energy.  Due to the evil energy I would have had to throw the disk away but since it was defective anyway I just watched disk two and then returned the set.

Disk two contains two parts.  The first part hits on various conspiracies and then part two is a presentation given by Al Bielek.

I've been following The Philadelphia Experiment for quite some time.  I have quite a few vhs tapes and dvds where Al Bielek talks about it and other things.

I had been reading some of the books about the Montauk Project also.

But one night I came home and had three messages on my answering machine.  When I pressed that button I heard the most blood curdling electronic sounds imaginable.  It sounded like creatures who were talking backwards.

That's when I stopped reading the books about Montauk.

I have heard similar sounds again when I was watching the movie The Ametyville Horror a lot.  I should have recorded them and played them backards so I could have understood what they were saying.  Then again maybe it's better I didn't do this.

This is a very strange story.  Al Bielek says some things which are somewhat believeable (although always very bizarre) and others which really stretch the limits of imagination such as FDR signed agreements with 'aliens'.

Just as one example Al claims he was born in 1916 which would make him over 90 years old right now.  But he gained some years back when his soul was transferred into the body of a baby and he had to grow up all over again.

Duncan jumped overboard during The Philadelphia Experiment and got left in the future so he gained 40 years in a way since at his then current age he moved ahead 40 years in time so he's still relatively young now also.

I believe that these people were directly involved with The Philadelphia Experiment.  What they say matches up with real people and places which they name including the brilliant Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann and the enigmatic Nikola Tesla as well as Albert Einstein.

I'm not quite as sure about the part about so called 'aliens'.  To me it is possible that what they think are aliens are something else. Something evil.

Perhaps fate has sent us Al Bielek to both inform us about real events and entertain us with further imaginings.

Preston Nichols is another very mysterious figure in this strange saga.  In the Montauk books he says he started feeling very tired because he was working on two separate projects but they were erasing the memories of one of these projects from his conscious mind.

It would be fun to hang out with these guys and talk to them for a long time.  That would be any new ager's dream come true.

It appears to me that starting around the time of World War 2 a race began to rediscover lost secrets which, although they seem new to us, were well known in the very ancient past on Atlantis and ancient Egypt.  Al Bielek and Duncan's father was involved with this research.  He's the one that got his sons involved.

These things are outside of our every day experiences so for us now they exist in the realm of rumors, conspiracies, and science fiction.

I believe there is something evil and satanic about all of this.  And in fact the sinister Aleister Crowley appears on the cover of one of the Montauk books.  There's more going on here than just science.

These strange projects include many murders and disappearances.

I think Edgar Cayce said something like ""Evil has many faces."".  I have found this to be true.

8210367,5,B000TQW2KG,"This video set is what I was waiting for. I heard all about the Montauk Base and the Philadelphia Experiment, but never had all the information.

8210368,2,B000TQW2KG,"The video was entertaining at its best, and laborsome at its weakest.
I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone serious about discovering
real information on this topic.
There MAY be some truth in parts of it (Who knows?)
However, this may be difficult to discern, as most of the content I
found to have only entertainment value, and parts that seemed factual
I believe to be misleading.  I base this opinion on the reality of
there being not enough information available that is verifiable on
the topic.  If you like wild-goose chases though, this DVD might be fun.",1192924800,6,568,4.7272727272727275
