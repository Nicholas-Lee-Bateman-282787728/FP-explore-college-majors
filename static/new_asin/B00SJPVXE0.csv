6991023,1,B00SJPVXE0,This is a movie that should have been made to tell the story of a C or D list celebrity but not the story of Whitney Houston. This movie screamed low budget and rushed.,1467158400,,168,3.9705882352941178
6991024,1,B00SJPVXE0,"What a bunch of bulls***! This movie does nothing to celebrate the illustrious career of Whitney Houston. It does nothing but make her look like some uneducated junkie whore who destroyed Bobby Brown's life. We all know that isn't true. Whitney Houston's brother Michael Houston admitted during a recent Oprah interview that he was the one who first did drugs with Whitney. He said the first time she tried pot or coke was around 1987-1988. Whitney met Bobby in 1989 and he was already smoking pot and using coke and had a drinking problem before he met Whitney. Bobby admits that Whitney did not use drugs in the 80's and early 90's as frequently as people like to believe. She never did coke around him until they went on their honeymoon. This movie shows Yaya playing the role of someone she knows nothing about. Lifetime and Angela Bassett should be ashamed of themselves. Whitney would never snort coke at a party openly in front of a room full of people. She was very discreet about her drug use until much later in life. This movie was based on tabloid stories and hearsay. No one in the family that were personally associated with Whitney helped write this script. They make Bobby look like a saint who does no wrong...! Where is the back story, the story about how she broke so many records. About her influence on the music industry. About how she is the greatest singer of all time. This movie is a sham and does not do anything for this beautiful spirited woman's legacy. Sure she was addicted to drugs but that is not all Whitney Houston was. She was every woman. Her story deserves to be told the right way. Also, Who wants to watch a Whitney movie and listen to some other singer sing her songs? Whitney was the voice. Nobody can sing her songs better than she did. There is nothing real or authentic about this movie. Its entertaining...but this is not the LOVE/LIFE story of WHITNEY AND BOBBY.",1455494400,4,1910,4.571428571428571
6991025,4,B00SJPVXE0,"I heard bits and pieces Whitney Huston/Brown's but I did not know much so I rented this.  Also I love everything Angela Bassett does so it was a no brainer.  I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 because it was not filmed as well as I hoped and the film's versions of her work did not measure up to Whitney's work.  Whitney's abilities to channel her sadness into beautiful music was amazing.  She could basically make you cry.  For the last song in the film, I would have chosen to have Yaya lip sink an original song.  I was sad that this was just as much of a Bobby Brown film as a Whitney Huston film.  I know Bobby was a huge part of her life but I would have liked a scene or two with her turning a painful event into a song.  Casting, make up and wardrobe were fantastic!  Many times I felt almost fooled by the illusion of them being young and alive.  I'm really glad this was made.  Whitney Huston really deserved a movie and it was a good one.",1455062400,,947,4.064864864864865

Thank God there was no strong language, but there are a couple of strong (adult) scenes...I could have done without some of that detail, but I am glad that the Director (Angela Bassett) choose to present this picture for ""Lifetime"" TV.  I believe it takes a very talented Director to make good movie and leave out all of the vulgarity that some of us choose to live without...shucks it is enough strong (profane) language going on in the world...and it serves no purpose at all.  Great job, Angela Bassett, hats of to you!!!",1443139200,3,588,4.580952380952381

6991035,3,B00SJPVXE0,"What Diana Ross was to the 70s and 60s, Whitney was to the late 80s/early 90s. So to see the biopic of one of the most celebrated singers reduced to a Lifetime movie is shocking at best and disappointing at its worst. Though most people might be shocked to learn that Whitney's introduction to drugs was way before Bobby came into her life. It is a fact that few might accept except as a movie plot turner, but it was indeed a reality. Each member gets their day in the spotlight though this is heavily focused on the Whitney character, and to a lesser degree, a sight not. The promotion department gets there opportunity to shine with hits.",1441152000,,641,4.440677966101695

6991040,5,B00SJPVXE0,"Angela Basset received her directorial debut making the film that was a partial documentation on Whitney Houston's life.

 The movie is nowhere near as good as a film for HBO or theaters (it was shot for Lifetime TV), but it is still a good dramatization of one of the greatest stars ever,

 The movie deals with the difficult relationship between Whitney and husband Bobbi Brown, Whitney's battle with cocaine (way before Bobbi enter her life) and the destruction of her marriage due to Bobbi's alcoholism and Whitney's descent into drug addiction.
y and pushed her into a world tour after ""I Will Always Love You ""(the Dolly Parton penned-song) hit #1 for 14 straight weeks. One really gets the impression it was Clive Davis who ultimately destroyed Whitney forcing her to do a world tour right after she did 'The Bodyguard"" and the had the biggest hit of her lifer. To make matters worse Davis knew she had a cocaine problem as early as the late '90s. Shame on you Clive...your obviously a money grabber,

 The film has strong acting and the script is well written although the Houston estate had nothing to do with the movie. Arista Records refused any of Whitney's vocals be used in the movie so a singer dubbed the songs.",1435276800,3,1227,4.683720930232558
6991041,4,B00SJPVXE0,"Whitney Houston will always be one of the greatest singers of her generation and beyond. Her untimely death shocked the world, but didn't surprise the few who knew her so well. In the made for television movie, Whitney, directed by Angela Basset and released by Lifetime, we are shown as a spectator the rise and fall of a beloved celebrity.

Bassets take on the movie is told in a heroic way, and it deserves to be viewed by those who arrived at the fandom of Whitneys voice and acting talent, and who felt deep sorrow for her demise. Watching the movie, I was drawn into the story by the cinematic talent of Anastas Michos with his long, silent shots that kept the drama raw in an artsy way. The movie felt incredibly real and often ugly. - http://movieroar.net/2015/06/17/whitney/",1434499200,,783,4.673913043478261
6991042,5,B00SJPVXE0,YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE,1434326400,,24,4.0
6991043,5,B00SJPVXE0,"Yaya DaCosta as Whitney is AMAZING. She channels Whitney is an almost eerie manner, and it is brilliant to watch. I am long-time fans of both Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, so the recreation of the late 1980s and 1990s in their story was really impressive and entertaining.",1433376000,3,275,4.75
6991044,3,B00SJPVXE0,"The bio-pic genre of films is a precarious breed. How does a bio film stay entertaining, and yet also provide insight without turning into a documentary? To me, a good bio-pic can do both. Whitney is not, in my opinion, entertaining nor informative. All that is presented is mostly tabloid reenactments. There is no backstory, no foreshadowing, and no character development that explains/shows how Whitney became Whitney.  For example, there is no hint as to why and how she started taking drugs. Considering this was the vice that killed her, it would have been an interesting and informative story line to know how and when she was introduced to those substances.

For what it's worth, Yaya DaCosta does a commendable job of portraying Whitney. Yaya mastered many of Whitneys mannerisms and does a believable job of singing and performing.  Vocals were actually performed   and performed well  by Deborah Cox.  Arlen Escarpeta plays Bobby and does his best to be street.

The movie could have been entitled Whitney and Bobby, as their relationship is really the bulk of the movie and there is nothing new presented. This could have been any domestic couple torn apart by vices and infidelity, except this movie couple had a sound track by Whitney Houston.",1433116800,,1257,4.980861244019139
6991045,3,B00SJPVXE0,It should've been titled Whitney & Bobby Brown.,1433030400,,47,5.0
6991046,3,B00SJPVXE0,"Anyone who knows me is aware of my love for the late Whitney Houston...I adore this woman, y'all.  I grew up jamming to her music and belting out all of her classic tunes.
So naturally, when she died in 2012, I was heartbroken...I couldn't believe that this iconic diva was gone.  She inspired and moved millions of people around the world with her golden voice and radiant smile.  She will be missed for a very long time.
My heart goes out to her loved ones as well, especially her daughter who is now fighting her own battle.

This brings me to the movie...I have mixed feelings about it.  Many people aren't too thrilled with this Lifetime production for various reasons:  Whitney's death being a sensitive subject, the fact that she passed away only a few years ago, the fact that it is a Lifetime movie (hence it is a low-budget film) and the fact that Whitney's family does not approve.
Angela Bassett has taken a lot of flack for her decision to make this film and quite a number of people are polarized on the issue.

Personally, I see both good and not so good in it.  The good?  First, the packaging.  I love the pink and white dust jacket that covers the DVD case...it features Yaya DaCosta made up as Whitney and looks very feminine.
Second, the casting wasn't bad either.  Yaya has the same tall, thin frame as Whitney and the same velvety brown complexion;  it is obvious that they tried to recreate some of Whitney's late 80's-early 90's style with her sparkly dresses, curls piled high or short hair, and effortless glamour.  And my favorite scene is when they reenact Whitney in the studio singing ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"" (vocals by Deborah Cox; no original music was used in the movie).

Arlen Escarpeta plays Whitney's bad-boy lover/husband, Bobby Brown, very well...I loved his dance moves in the film.
 However, I must say that the movie glossed over much of Brown's abusive treatment of his wife.  Although the film does show some of his wild shenanigans, he is generally portrayed as a stand-up guy;  I had to suspend disbelief while watching certain scenes.
Maybe he is portrayed this way because Bassett feared a lawsuit from him or even from Whitney's family if the truth about their relationship was actually shown.

Yaya played her part very well considering that this was a TV movie about a world-famous icon with extraordinary talent. She shows Whitney's girlish charm and vulnerability, as well as the singer's dependency on drugs and her complicated love for Bobby Brown.
They nailed her wedding attire perfectly too...it is uncanny how much detail is in this movie.  Maybe one day Whitney's story will get the Hollywood treatment it deserves but for now, this movie isn't that bad.  I wish it had been more conclusive and less focused on her relationship with Bobby.
It should have been called ""Whitney and Bobby"" because that is pretty much what it is.  I wanted more insight into Whitney herself...why she was so unhappy, why she became addicted to drugs, why she stayed in a relationship that was toxic.
I wanted to see even more of the beauty and talent that Whitney was famous for.  Instead, I was left wanting.

But all in all, I rate it a solid 3 stars...worth watching but still missing some things that would have made it even better.  I didn't find it disrespectful to Whitney's memory or to her family, but some might disagree.",1432771200,6,3371,4.6938775510204085

8698661,4,B00SJPVXE0,"Good paced tv movie which centres mainly on Whitney's relationship with Bobby Brown before their divorce. Lead actors play their parts very convincingly.
