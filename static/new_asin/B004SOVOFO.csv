8440047,1,B004SOVOFO,"Beware! The product description says this DVD is only 12 minutes long. This is supposed to be a full episode of the 60 minutes news series about this story. Even considering 26 minutes eliminated for ads, it should still be at least 30 minutes long.

Regardless, for only 12 minutes it is not worth paying a full DVD movie price we would pay for a top selling full length 2 hour movie like Harry Potter, Star Trek or Independence day.

At over 17 d011ars; they are charging over a d011ar per minute for a 12 minute video??

Absurd!",1340409600,3,531,4.3979591836734695
