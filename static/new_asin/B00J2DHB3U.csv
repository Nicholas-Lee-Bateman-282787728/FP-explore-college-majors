They screwed up by making this more of a soft core, Saturday morning cartoon like series, plus this costed way to much for this collection it should've been at least $10. For $50 I would get the complete Uncensored versions instead of this sorry excuse of filth. LA Blue Girl was 1000 times better this this.",1469491200,,461,5.0

8647361,4,B00J2DHB3U,"Finally, a review for this box set and exactlywhat it has. This box set includes the 4 Urotsukidoji films in censored format. You can read on wikipedia exactly how many minutes were taken out of the films. All in all, it is still quite explicit even with the censoring. You will get some the sex scenes and all the gore. The editing came into play on these prolonged sex scenes that did nothing for the plot. The important ""plot"" sex scenes are still in. A weird thing here is that there are NO SUBTITLES. You can either watch in in straight japanese dialog or horrible english dub dialog. But it's so bad that it works on some level. The quality of the picture is very good and the sound quality is also acceptable. You get some previews of other naughty anime, brief history on Overfiend, and some CD Rom features which I have not checked out. One thing I really like the box art which is better than that on the Blu-ray. The first 3 movies are pretty good with the fourth one going completely in another direction that no one liked. Still this is a good set. I got it for $50 and it is much better than hunting down some Perfect Collection priced at over $250 to $500.
I gave it 4 stars because it is not the uncut versions of the films, but this is as close as we are going to get, and the end product is still very good. As usual, these are horror/erotic animes that are not for children and if you are reading this, you are probably looking for this kind of stuff. It's easy to dismiss this stuff as trash, but I can tell you this thing is a masterpiece of horror, violence, sex, and the end of the world. It's epic in it's scope and has the passion of a madman. Never seen anything like this before or since. If you like the hardcore, melt your mind with OVERFIEND.",1433808000,3,1772,4.245562130177515
8647362,5,B00J2DHB3U,"The Legend of the Overfiend is a classic.  Bottom line: if you love good classic anime/manga then get this.  The bar was set for all the evil villians from this one.  Sure its older, but isn't that what makes it endure?  If you don't have it, you need to add it to your collection, but don't get the dubbed version....it just doesn't seem to work out well for the story.",1216080000,,370,4.242857142857143
