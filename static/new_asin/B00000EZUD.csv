7906020,4,B00000EZUD,"This tape series provides excellent information about the development of terrorist movements between WWII and 1990.  Obviously, terrorism has since changed in some aspects.  However, the essential elements of terrorism are still evident in this tape series.  The pictures are starkly vivid, bringing home to the uninitiated, the horrors and reality of terrorism in the modern world.  This is an excellent introduction to terrorism and its roots.",1035331200,,445,5.597014925373134
7906021,2,B00000EZUD,"These series of tapes may at first seem to offer credible and accurate information for the viewer.  Instead, these tapes try to take the very complex study of ""terrorism"" (political violence) and explain it in 60 minute intervals.  The only utility of some of these tapes is the background information on some of the groups portrayed in the series.  I would highly suggest any viewer to question the credibility of the information on these tapes and also note the dating of the material examined.
As a scholar of political violence (""terrorism""), I would suggest viewers instead pickup books and journal articles to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon of ""terrorism.""",992131200,3,677,5.081081081081081
