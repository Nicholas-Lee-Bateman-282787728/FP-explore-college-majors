1805853,5,B00007AJEC,"Though I was unaware of this British film, I am such a fan of Peter Sellers I had to order it. Once again, completely entertained by the antics of Sellers and the other cast in this enchanting little film. If Peter Sellers is a favorite and you enjoy British humor, you will love this B&W classic.",1397865600,,297,4.321428571428571
1805854,4,B00007AJEC,"Pleasant movie. Simple story with nice characters. No car crashes or explosions, gunfire or sex scenes. A normal movie for normal people. From a time not that long ago when the previous phrase wouldn't be attacked as ""offensive"". Watch it and enjoy it. View the digitally remastered version though. This one is a really bad copy.",1365811200,,329,4.892857142857143
1805855,2,B00007AJEC,"Most of these movies are old banal movies whose only notable feature is that the young peter Sellers was in them. I am glad I bought them, but I am addicted to his work.

1805856,4,B00007AJEC,"The half-dozen British-made films featured in THE PETER SELLERS COLLECTION are nicely dubbed. There's no ""extras"" with this set.

Best IMO is HOFFMAN. In what is essentially a two-character psychological study, Sellers portrays a lonely middle-aged businessman who blackmails a young girl from the office pool into spending a week with him. At first she's totally creeped out, but in time gets to better understand the importunate Mr. H.

I'M ALL RIGHT JACK! has some great sight gags and adult humor. It's the story of a young man at loose ends after returning from WWII who's trying to decide on a career path.

HEAVENS ABOVE is a good satire on both religion and commercialism, but it's spoiled by a silly ""minister in space"" finale.

THE SMALLEST SHOW ON EARTH is an early success for Sellers, who plays an elderly projectionist in a rundown movie theater.

CARLETON-BROWNE is a mediocre Terry-Thomas political farce where Sellers is wasted as the corrupt prime minister of an island nation long affiliated wth Britain. Not very funny or entertaining.

TWO WAY STRETCH is a neatly done prison comedy that has Sellers pulling a heist with an ironclad alibi for protection: supposedly he's incarcerated when this crime occurs.

Very surprised that there's only one review of this lovely film here! We got it during our present Peter Sellers mania; we're trying to see everything he was in and this was on the list as one of his first. His role is in fact a supporting, low-key one, yet he gently plays it to the hilt and is very entertaining.

But what makes this film so fun is that the same can be said for everyone in it. There's not a duff performance in the lot, and McKenna and Travers are so thoroughly likeable that the film just made us smile the entire time. William Rose's script is crisp and friendly, and one of the best things about SSOE is that it's 80 compact minutes, leaving one hungry for more instead of overstuffed, as with so many comedies. Director Dearden is to be commended for not wasting a second; one of the other best features of this film is the very swift cuts from thought to action, which keeps one interested; little time is wasted on leisurely exposition, yet the film never feels rushed.

Smallest Show is in fact a model of post-war British comedy, one of the best I've seen of a generally fine genre. There's a genuinely warm heart to this film that produces a pleasant glow in the viewer; we just watched this black and white gem on a gray, rainy Sunday afternoon in early March, and the fit was perfect. One of those movie-viewing experiences that we will remember fondly as the years go by, actually, and that's thanks to the warm, friendly spirit of this movie. It's clear that all involved were enjoying themselves, and that synergy produced a quietly unassuming comedy classic.

The other review here mentions that the dvd looked and sounded poor, which is odd as ours looked very good indeed, a clean transfer with minimal picture noise and good black depth, and the soundtrack was very distinct. Perhaps the s/n ratio was a bit low, as in many old films, but nothing that raising the volume didn't fix. I thought the dvd, despite no extras except a brief Sellers bio, was in fact quite commendable, having seen some not-so-fine old b&w transfers as of late.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the feel of '50s b&w comedy, a happy helping of old school British warmth, or gently fun good-spirited humor in general.",1267920000,8,2258,4.538083538083538
1805858,3,B00007AJEC,"This film is a classic of British cinema, with great performances from Peter Sellers & Margaret Rutherford. Good screenplay with excellent dialogue. Unfortunately the quality of the DVD is terrible, very bad image and sound quality, in fact much the same quality as you get on those cheap boxed DVDs of 50 out-of-copyright films. This DVD appears to have been copied from a poor quality VHS tape.",1265241600,9,396,4.925373134328358
1805859,5,B00007AJEC,"If your a Sellers fan you should give this a try,this stuff is not as well known as the Pink Panther stuff,or of his Kubrick work,but still these are smallhard to find British gems nonetheless,a great companion piece to Anchor Bay's Alec Guinness Collection!!! This was a quite the bargain at just $13.99 new when amazon ran a sale(I just hate paying full retail price for stuff),considering a few years ago this same collection had a price yag well over $50.00!!! Like I said befor a great Sellers collection from the folks at Anchor Bay,get it before it goes out of print(Anhor Bay DVD's seem to do just that) and the price skyrockets!!!",1229731200,2,639,4.663716814159292

7975089,4,B00007AJEC,"I enjoyed this DVD immensely, although much of it seems quite dated today. The story-line of a young couple inheriting a run down cinema and trying to to turn it into a commercial proposition, has many hilarious moments.  Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers are delightful as the young couple; the acting is superb, with many famous stars, such as Margaret Rutherford and Peter Sellers.featuring in the film.",1456790400,,406,5.059701492537314

7975092,3,B00007AJEC,"Sweet and little known film.  I first saw this on VHS many years ago and had forgotten it.  When I saw it available on DVD, I snapped it up. The story is just as entertaining as I remember -- a young couple learns that they are the sole heirs of a long lost uncle and inherit a decrepit old movie theatre and its equally decrepit old staff.  Having to decide between selling it for practically nothing (the owner of the large, fancy theatre wants the land for a parking lot) and opening it in hopes of getting more money for it, they opt for the latter.  And much humor ensues.
While the movie is delightful, the DVD is not. HORRIBLE, washed out transfer, tolerable sound quality.  While I'm assuming that the movie is in the public domain and so isn't worth remastering, it does deserve better than this.
(BTW, if you're buying it for Peter Sellers, be aware that his role is fairly small.)",1450656000,,891,4.408536585365853
7975093,1,B00007AJEC,"The 1 start is for the quality of the transfer which is almost unwatchable, the picture is blurred and jumpy and very soft, the sound is very poor often crackles and is muffiled so its hard to hear dialogue.
This is not re-mastered as I would have expected,  if it was then it would have clear sound and a sharp picture, this does not have either, in fact a its worse than a VHS transfer to DVD!

The movie itself is great fun spoiled by the very poor quality, I hope this gets properely remastered in the future.",1437523200,,513,4.224489795918367
