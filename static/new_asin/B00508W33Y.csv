8450880,1,B00508W33Y,Could not really watch the whole thing.  Was very disappointed.  Not much else to say.,1448668800,,86,4.666666666666667
8450881,5,B00508W33Y,"I rather loved this movie and I thought it was good, but I'm a huge Jason fan!  In fact, I think I may watch it again tonight!  He's just too cute!",1433289600,,147,3.7096774193548385

8450883,3,B00508W33Y,"I am not that much into chick flicks, but thought this one was pretty good.
Yes, certain things where predictable and certain things pleasantly surprised me.
I wasn't to keen about costume design, the cinematography, and the graphics
of the texting and stuff, otherwise I would have rated it a bit higher. But I work in film so I guess
I look at it in a different way and also knowing how hard it is to make a film.
I thought all the actors where fun to watch.",1360108800,,460,4.238636363636363
8450884,4,B00508W33Y,"Why they changed the name from Textuality I haven't a clue. Sexting does not really fit. The sex was in person not on sexting on the phone. Texting is just used to hook up. It was a fun movie for an afternoon when you have some time to kill. If you like Kris Holden-Ried you will like his part in the movie.  He plays Colin really well, and you get to see a lot of him ;)",1342915200,3,371,3.8181818181818183
8450885,3,B00508W33Y,"Watchable but somewhat soapy, superficial, and contrived.  It starts to get promising around half way through it but, unfortunately, falls flat again.  Feels like a movie they could easily show on TV for holidays, with just 5 seconds worth of editing, not even sure why it deserved an R rating... Government subsidized fare, although the governments of Canada and Ontario probably got some of their money's worth via the characteristically discreet promotion of Toronto :-)",1321142400,2,473,5.293333333333333
