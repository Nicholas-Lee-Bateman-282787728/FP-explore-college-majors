This movie is well-intentioned VHS quality material narrated by a kindly-sounding older gentleman of the distant-relative-who-talks-down-to-the-adorable-kids variety.  If you can imagine the distant relative who becomes familiar with the kids far too quickly and then ends a ten-minute conversation with ""Bye, I love you!"" then you can imagine my children, who were first patient, then inattentive, then bored, and finally creeped-out.  My advice is to look elsewhere.",1387152000,,682,5.336448598130841
