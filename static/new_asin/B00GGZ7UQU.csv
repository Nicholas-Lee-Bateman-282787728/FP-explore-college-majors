8622940,5,B00GGZ7UQU,"I saw Uriah Heep back in 1974 in Pittsburgh, Pa. I still love them to this day.  This is a great DVD!  Even though David Byron is not with them anymore the new singer is almost as good as him.  Great sound and picture. If you are a Uriah Heep fan then you will love this.  I wish they would put this on blue ray.",1488326400,,312,3.753846153846154
