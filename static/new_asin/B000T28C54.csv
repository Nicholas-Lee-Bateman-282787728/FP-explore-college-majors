8207525,4,B000T28C54,"I liked the movie, but it's one of those cheesy sense of humor movies. I ordered it because I really like Elvin and honestly only got it to look at him. It's one of those movies that you laugh all the way through, but probably wouldn't watch it all the time.",1395619200,,258,4.078431372549019
8207526,2,B000T28C54,"This is a story about male strippers. Elvin (Elvin Bibiloni) gets evicted from his apartment. Fabian (J. Fabian) and a few guys help him move out. That is pretty much it. They encounter some problems and have flashbacks. The title comes from the drug ""G"" that they take, a liquid form of ecstasy.

The stories are insulting and juvenile. The humor is coarse and immature. The film opens with a disclaimer, warning that the film is insulting to race, religion, and women who are typically called the ""C"" word. The film compares itself to South Park, but it lacks the cleverness. If you can't enough of the Howard Stern type adolescence humor, then this film is certainly for you. Hip-Hop music for much film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, C-word, heck the whole alphabet-word, sex, nudity.",1361491200,3,791,4.851851851851852
