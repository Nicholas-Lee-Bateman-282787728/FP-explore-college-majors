8496631,4,B006CVNMKG,"A typical perfectly cued Jazzercise product. Three demonstrators, easy, medium hard. They use mirror cuing, so very professional. I had done a live class of this program so I knew what to expect. This is not exactly the same as the live classes, but close enough.

A minor qualification is that if you have knee issues, the amount of plie' in this video will be a challenge. You can follow the 'easy' demonstrator which will help.

I do want to say that although they use ballet terms, this isn't a 'ballet' video. It's a video that uses select ballet terms and techniques to improve balance, posture, and strength.

They don't talk about posture that I remember, but you can't do the exercises well unless you use good posture.

With the 3 demonstrators you can make this as easy or hard as you want it.",1339286400,6,804,4.5625
8496632,3,B006CVNMKG,"This DVD starts out a little slow...after having Jazzercise class, it was snail speed.
BUT boy did I feel it in my arms for days!
The legs and abs were OK- but the arms really got a work out.
I got over how slow it was knowing it was working!",1334188800,2,242,3.86
8496633,4,B006CVNMKG,"This is my first jazzercise video, so I can't compare it to other ones, but I do enjoy the workout.  It's not much of an arm workout, but my abs and legs feel pretty tired when I'm done.  The music is kind of lame, but the instructors are upbeat.  Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase!",1332892800,4,294,4.12280701754386
8496634,5,B006CVNMKG,"I don't have jazzercise classes nearby so have 4 DVDs, and I'm so glad this is one of them! I warm up with a 30-min Jazzercise routine then do this one 1 or 2x a week. It was hard at first, like any new exercise, but in addition to the 40 minute workouts, I also use the 10 minute ab burn/leg burn after my regular Jazzercise workouts. It's a great bonus, and helps keep you conditioned on the days you don't do the full 40-min workout.

I took 2 intro to ballet classes, so am a little familiar with some of the moves and positions. This DVD has great exercises that really do work your legs, abs, and because they also try to maintain the carriage of the arms, you get a mean arm workout...even when the focus is legs! There are also some Pilates moves and a really nice stretch at the end. (Sometimes during my other workouts, I pop this DVD in and skip to the 5-minute stretch at the end!) I don't sweat during this workout because it's not cardio, but your muscles definitely DO get a workout!

The instructors are really great and their voices are all very encouraging and motivating. The music is upbeat, not like classical ballet music. Jazzercise workouts always give you a modified (easy) and advanced (hard) option, including this one, which is great, since it's another way to check your progress.

I've had this DVD since Thanksgiving and have gotten stronger and more flexible. I can finally touch my toes (I am at a healthy weight, just not super flexible!) and my hip flexors don't get as sore as they used to. I'm really happy with this DVD, go get one today!",1328918400,5,1576,4.40893470790378
8496635,5,B006CVNMKG,This workout dvd is very enjoyable.  Lots of stretching and core muscle work.  And I get to learn some ballet as well!  Instructor on the cover is lovely and worth watching for just how graceful she is!  Perfect for toning and working on balance.  Love it!,1328486400,4,256,4.478260869565218
