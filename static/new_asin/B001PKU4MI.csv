8333600,5,B001PKU4MI,I think this video captures most of the Historic Inauguration Day of President Obama.  (2009)  I will keep it as I would a great book.,1360454400,,134,4.32
8333601,5,B001PKU4MI,Excellent commentary on the road to the White House for President Obama and pictures are spectacular.,1249344000,,101,5.375
8333602,5,B001PKU4MI,"This is an outstanding professional DVD.  Excellent job of showcasing Black history and presidential history from the beginning of this nation to the present.  Also lots of interview with African Americans expressing in their own words what this election means to them.  I preferred this DVD to the CNN DVD of the inauguration; the CNN DVD captured the inauguration but had no foreword or historical significance of the election other than the bits of information noted by CNN personnel who were covering the event.  If you're into history, this is a must have for your library.",1245715200,2,578,4.989583333333333
8333603,4,B001PKU4MI,"Well done and compiled, this video fell short on inauguration day content. I wasn't able to attend the inauguration and wanted to feel like I could see what I missed. This video doesn't exactly deliver on that promise.",1239580800,3,218,4.7631578947368425
8333604,5,B001PKU4MI,I am happy with condition as well as quality of product I received. The delivery was also quicker than promised. I will buy again from Amazon.,1237680000,,142,4.5
8333605,1,B001PKU4MI,"I was looking forward to seeing and purchasing a DVD of President Obama's inaugration ceremony and the following parade.  What I got was a documentary on a president that happens to be Black and and Black Americans.  By the way, I AM BLACK!

Perhaps the producers of the video thought since it was referred to as a ""journey"" we would assume it was about the civil rights journey.  However, the ""journey"" could be about anything including the election journey, the ""Democratic Party's journey"" or any number of other titles.

What I was hoping to see was a story on the inauguration of man who won the presidency that was able to do so by bringing people from all over our great nation and the world of all stripes, colors and background!  I did not need to get a Black documentary which this was because that is not what the story was supposed to be about.  If it was advertised as a Black perspective then fine, I would have known that what it was and not have bought it because that was NOT my interest.  That said, if that is what you are looking for, then it is decent piece.  However, it was advertised as a story of the inauguration of the President of the United States, not a Black President.

Only insignificant portions of the DVD were devoted to the inauguration ceremony (which was what I was supposed to be buying) and the parade which I was hoping to see a significant portion of lasted no more than 2 minutes or so in it's entirty with 2 bands of about 30 seconds each.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!",1235952000,12,1511,4.438405797101449
8333606,1,B001PKU4MI,"I was very disappointed with this DVD.  It showed little of the actual ""journey"" of Obama personally, and alot of civil rights history (stuff I already own).  It showed too much of all the people gathered in DC. I really did not want to see them.  I was  hoping to see more of the story of Obama as he and his family the VP and the Bushes, prepared for the inauguration.  This dvd footage must have come from CNN with mostly crowd coverage and little focus on the candidate. Fox News, surprisingly, has excellent coverage of the inauguration with lots of close ups of the then pres-elect and his wife and the DC inner circle.",1235606400,7,625,4.4
