8377705,4,B002QEXBCM,"This happens to be one of my favorite operas--I have 9 DVDs of it--and this is an interesting adaptation in a very good restoration.  But as one early critic said, in this version the opera has really been turned into a play with a few songs.  Felsenstein has made a lively innovative film for its time (1970) but the opera itself is all but lost in the process (there is lots of added spoken dialogue).  One-third to a half of the gorgeous music (in the latest longer restored versions of the score) is missing.  The better dubbed film version is by Powell and Pressburger (1951, now in a superb Criterion Collection edition) but lovers of the music will need one of the filmed theatrical performances--and I personally would recommend the new, wildly untraditional Olivier Py sex-driven performance from Geneva (2008), although newcomers might want to start with something more down to earth like Domingo at Covent Garden (1981).",1269302400,2,931,4.8734177215189876
