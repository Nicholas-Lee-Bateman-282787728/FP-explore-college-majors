Although this video was very expensive for 1 hour of content, and there are many other episodes that I simply cannot find, I'm very pleased to have gotten my hands on this video.  Thumbs up for the seller: fast shipment and excellent packaging.  The Thunderbirds 2086 exist as both a cartoon and a puppet animation show.  Both are excellent, although I have a preference for the cartoon.",1389052800,,596,4.628571428571429
