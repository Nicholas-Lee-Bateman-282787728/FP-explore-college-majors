1390270,5,B000053V7C,"Unlike many other early John Waters fans, I have not been disappointed with his most recent efforts. Though perhaps not as perverse as Pink Flamingoes, as psychotic as Female Trouble or as jaw-droppingly appalling as Desperate Living, Cecil B. Demented is a hilarious, smart and even political film about a band of cinema terrorists (The Sprocketholes) who aim to overthrow Hollywood. Melanie Griffith is absolutely perfect as Honey Whitlock, an aging Hollywood starlet, who is kidnapped by the group and forced to star in their Guerrilla-style film ""Raving Beauty."" Loaded with characters that only Waters could dream up (an ex-porn star gone celibate for cinema, a male hairdresser who's ashamed of his heterosexuality), killer lines (""before I was a drug addict, I had so many problems; now I just have one - drugs!""), oddball cameos (Rikki Lake as Honey Whitlock's assistant, the spectacular Mink Stole - one of the original Dreamlanders - who dies of a heart attack after Cecil kidnaps Honey, Patty Hearst as a Sprockethole's mother, Kevin Nealon as Forrest Gump in the sequel ""Gump Again"") and overall fabulous costumes and style, Cecil B. is not to be missed. Where else are you going to find references to Fassbinder, Hershcell Gordon Lewis and Mel Gibson's balls in the span of an hour and a half?",982540800,4,1306,5.023041474654378

1390272,4,B000053V7C,"""Cecil B. Demented"" is a riot.  This is the first DVD I've ever rented that suprised me before the movie even started.  Suffice it to say there's a little surprise.
  The cast is excellent.  Melanie Griffith is perfect as Honey Whitmore, an actress who thinks she's more popular than she really is.  She plays an uberbitch with incredible panache.  Stephen Dorff plays the title character with enough energy to light up a whole state!  Performances like these are what keeps the movie flowing despite it's quirky style.
  What struck me the most about this film was Cecil's declaration that ""nobody gets to have sex until the film is finished"".  By doing this, the sexual tension in the movie buildds and builds.  I can just hear the ultraconservatives whining now about how depraved this movie is.  Why?  Because it made them think about sex without giving them any.
  I also got a big laugh when Cecil and company lock horns with ""Family Film"" fans protesting a movie.  Honey points out that Family film is just another word for censorship.  How true.
  Despite being a hilarious movie for B movie film buffs, there are also some great points made without being preachy.  That's because Waters manages to teeter between spoof and satire with expert efficiency.  Hollywood has been churning out formulaic movies, remakes, and sequels to sequels to sequels for years.  That's why Waters film gets four stars.
  Highly recommended for fans of John Waters and those who like cult flicks.",982281600,,1485,4.867469879518072

1390274,4,B000053V7C,"John Waters pulls together historical themes from both the news headlines and his own filmography to create a  twisted (what else?) and oddly familiar new work. Rather than a continuation of his post-Divine, post-Edith  Massey respectability (""Hairspray,"" ""Cry Baby,"" ""Serial Mom,"" and ""Pecker""), he blatantly and deftly steals his  own material from earlier edgy classics such as ""Pink Flamingoes,"" ""Female Trouble,"" and ""Polyester.""  Renegade fringe folk committing guerilla art. Crime as beauty. Baltimore's arthouse drive-in's and decaying  porno theaters. Violent suburban moms agitating against all that is unwholesome. Straight men cursing the  fates who made them heterosexual. Dying for art. Strict celibacy for the sake of the aesthetic. It's all back!
  ""Cecil B. Demented"" updates these themes with a fictional redux of the abduction and conversion of Patty  Hearst (catch her cameo!), exquisitely casting Melanie Griffith as a petulant, aging film starlet who bears more  than a passing resemblance to Nora Desmond. Waters spoofs his own low budget origins and the more recent  Dogma movement. (Dogma is the European independent film crusade that eschews Hollywood movies, opting  instead for cheap, fast schedule filmmaking with handheld cameras, no props, location shooting using only  available lighting and sound, no special effects, and natural staging with real-life action.)
  The film drags a bit during Cecil's professions of faith, and the Ricki Lake scenes are typically pointless, but  watch how far Mink stole has come since Mondo Trasho. And Kevin Nealon in ""Forrest Gump 2"" is not to be  missed.",981936000,2,1623,5.532520325203252

1390276,4,B000053V7C,"Renegade director Cecil B.

Battling Hollywood moguls, the police, and the media, Cecil will stop at nothing to finish his ""underground"" movie, and save cinema from the curse of HOLLYWOOD!
""Cecil B. Demented"" is John Waters the way we like him...totally crazy!  Although, NOT a movie for everyone, those looking for something out of the ordinary will be pleased with this send-up of renegade movie making.

Demented still comes off as a sweetly eccentric ode to everything that is great and honest about art, as well as an affectionate tribute to the freaks, weirdos, and  outsiders who make life so interesting. Of course, it also features an infectiously chipper Satanist, a vindictive handicapped child, a troubled porn diva, the utter annihilation of a Forrest Gump sequel, filmmaking techniques that involve grenades, Patty Hearst, and an epic battle between obese teamsters and aficionados of gerbil-based pornography.

Does the MPAA rate movies correctly, sense the late sixties they have been bestowed privileges to rate movies. With all that aside its a brilliant film, some parts are disgusting and may be too crude for younger viewers. For the most part ""Cecil B. Demented"" is an ""A"" class film, in this critics mind.

The fact that Stephen Dorf appeared in this film has also raised my respect for him as an actor.

It is after all a John Waters film, and a film set in his hometown of Baltimore. Which means the jokes will be hit-and-miss, with many best appreciated by film industry insiders and Maryland area residents. But the obvious fun the cast has playing their out-there characters is infectious. Melanie Griffith (Tippi Hedren's daughter) has a ball tweaking her diva image as she plays an aging star gradually won over to the cause of her kidnappers (insert Patti Hearst here who actually has a small part in the picture). Alicia Witt gives her best ever performance as the delectable porn star turned revolutionary. The best scene is when she and her fellow film revolutionaries hide out at a porn theater showing ""Rear Entry"", an anal epic co-starring Witt and a randy gerbil.

Stephen Dorff, before he went insane and got involved with Pamela (slug) Anderson, does a good job as the title character. But watch closely for an absolutely glowing performance by Gyllenhaal.

His roots are in the same 1950's leering, voyeuristic pop culture (or subculture) as mine (though unlike John I doubt I could ever prefer Jayne Mansfield to Marilyn); like me, he loved and faithfully attended B movies and double features (and like me and Roger Ebert, he was a big Russ Meyer fan); finally, his literary inspiration was the same as mine: Grace Metallious' ""Peyton Place"" (why did my high school teacher report me to my parents when I submitted a book report on PP?  I'd submit that today's students should be written up for not advancing beyond ""Narnia"" and all the other fantasy clutter).

In ""Cecil B. Demented"" Waters hits it on the head when he singles out and ridicules the two worst films of the past 15 years (""Patch Adams"" and ""Forrest Gump""), and there's enough diverting business to hold your attention for the duration, which is more than I can say for the other four Waters' movies that I've seen, beginning with the canonical, practically enshrined ""Pink Flamingos.""  (I may be in the minority, but Divine strikes me as no more sexy or funny than your average overweight truck driver in drag.  I'll take Melanie Griffith any day.)

The juvenilia in this film strikes me as less offensive than Waters' customary fare--providing you find 90 minutes of masturbation jokes more tolerable than 90 minutes of scatalogical ""humor.""  And the emphasis on pleasuring oneself seems to have more than shock value--if we take the director's ""message"" to be that the auteur who plays his instrument his own way is to be esteemed above the Hollywood director who sells out to corporate greed and the masses.  The film even offers a refreshing glimpse of cultist passion among local vigilantes in what clearly aspires to be a cult film itself.

But directors don't make cult films, audiences do--as Ed Wood may have discovered had he lived long enough.  And even the presence of Waters' new repertory player Patty Hearst can't give the film the bite, or cultish edge, that it's obviously seeking (Patty, after all, was never a vigilante--an ""extra,"" at best, during her celebrity stint with the Symbionese Liberation Army).

I suspect that the biggest problem with this film is its near Hollywood-sized budget, the biggest by far for a John Waters movie.  ""If you can't beat em, join em, but pretend you haven't"" Waters seems to be saying. The result is an odd concoction--an alternative film that's too mainstream to be cult, too slick to be camp, too infantile to be a ""big"" or commercially successful movie, and, worst, too insincere to convey a personal vision.

Their film, of course, is no better, but at least it is real.

Griffith is an aging Hollywood film star who is kidnapped and forced to star in Cecil's movie.

There is a porn queen (Cherish), a hair dresser who hates himself because he is NOT gay, a Goth makeup artist, and a whole bunch of wacky characters that keep the movie funny and fun to watch.

This is a well-deserved antidote to made-to-order, formulaic Hollywood films (which is, after all, what the main character is rebelling against).  It is up there with the best of Waters' work, and some scenes are quite unforgettable.",1095379200,2,1083,5.027932960893855

It seems Waters is trying to balance between mainstream filmmaking for the larger audience appeal, and keep his previous biting cutting-edge.  Serial Mom was able to do this -- this movie absolutely failed.  It is poorly written, poorly acted (Melanie Griffith a bad actor?  Yeah, that's a stretch), and poorly editted.
The movie is suppose to be making a statment against Hollywood turning out so much mediocore garbage.  This movie is a prime example of the type of garbage that shouldn't be turned out.
John Waters' movies are by all means still worth buying and watching, just avoid this one.",1082678400,,698,4.735537190082645

I kept picking this one up at the local library, but not taking it home.  This week I finally relented and gave it a spin.
What a waste of 90 minutes!  I should sue Waters' for the time I lost!
First, this movie isn't funny.  Not one single smile cracked my face.  Now, before you call me a prude, or a retard, I love wacky cinema.  Some of my favorite movies are off-the-wall films that most of my friends see as stupid and immature.
This one, though, never got so much as a smirk out of me.
The writing is dreadful, the directing and editing turn much of the overall plot into a sycophantic mess.  Some of the acting is fairly good, but so much profanity comes out of their mouths.
You know, just because someone says f#%k 1,000 times doesn't make them funny.  In fact, I find the use of profanity a sign that the comic has run out of ideas and is trying solely to shock.
And watching Waters crow over his work in the special features was painful.  He's such a no-talent freak, and you could tell his cast was imbarassed to be seen in the same shot is him.  (He reminded me of someone the Coen Brothers would make up in one of their paradoys - but I kept pinching myself, saying, ""this guy is REAL!""  Pathetic.)

The premise of terrorist fimmakers naking their own underground film with a kidnapped mainstream actress not sounds outrageous, it kind of makes sense in a film community  delivering products based on computer games or sequels to films that weren't very good to begin with. John Waters reminds us all that there was once a blossoming underground film industry,and Griffith reminds us that not every actor has to win an oscar to be cool. Stephen Dorf also makes an indelible impression in title role, and it's great to see cameos (although they are not long enough for my liking) of legendary dreamlanders Mary Vivian Pearce and Susan Lowe.

I was all set to laugh uproariously at an irreverent look at H-wood, but it started going downhill when Cecil asks Honey to take her clothes off, and the cast and crew drop everything to run to this screen and start masturbating. Stephen Dorff who did a nice job in ""Backbeat"" does his best with this paper-thin role.  Alicia Witt who was on TV's Cybil and in ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" does a valiant attempt as Cherish the porn star.  But while these rebellious cinematic mavericks are pursing their goals, they are also killing people.  For me, it was a bit like trying to develop a sit-com about the Manson Family; it just didn't work.  The end where the shoot's been concluded and everyone starts copulating is cut by the fact that many like Cherish take a bullet to the brain.  Self-mutilation & the starry eyed girl running around extolling the virtues of Satan weren't even poor taste; it wasn't funny and didn't work.  Melanie Griffith who I do like is the reason I rented; although I've enjoyed Waters' ""Pecker"" before.  She does a fairly good job with the role, but there isn't much depth required nor brought to the change from victim to willing participant.

1390416,2,B000053V7C,"John Waters is no ordinary director. I've always admired him for being an independent film maker and even for being somewhat of an anarchist. After he became fashionable, he still refused to make 'normal' movies, even though his projects were now financed by mainstream sources. His early works, Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble among them, lampooned the middle and lower-middle classes through an odd mix of cynicism and kindness. Later, in such movies as Polyester, Cry-Baby and Serial Mom, he did the same thing, but with bigger budgets and big name actors. His newest effort, Cecil B. Demented, takes aim at both mainstream Hollywood and low budget auteurs. I am afraid that this time he has missed the mark. The result is a low point in his career.
A group of insane would be movie makers, led by Cecil B. Demented [Stephen Dorff] has infiltrated a Baltimore movie house. When a big studio movie premieres there, they kidnap its star, Honey Whitlock [Melanie Griffith], for the purposes of having Ms. Whitlock star in Demented's movie and of retaliating against the Hollywood system. In the part that works best, the gang brainwashes Whitlock into becoming one of them, just as in real life the Symbionese Liberation Army brainwashed Patricia Hearst thirty years ago. To make the whole affair even more, uh, demented, Waters has Ms. Hearst herself play Cecil's mother. The converted Whitlock joins the gang in attacking a multiplex, a movie set and a meeting of the Baltimore Film Commission.
There are tons of film references here. Each member of this mad movie group sports a tattoo of his or her favorite director. The film set they attack is one for Forrest Gump 2. The multiplex they ransack is showing Patch Adams - the Director's Cut.
As in all John Water's movies, the cast seems to have had one big party during filming. The resulting effect is that of an amateurish high school production. This technique has served the director well in the past, adding to his movies' comic effect, but here it is simply irritating. It helps to confuse us as to just what Water's point is. If the studios can't make good movies and independents can't either, then is he saying no one can make one these days? Based on this picture, it seems at least that he can't.
Finally, Cecil B. Demented does not work because it is not so good movie that satirizes the fact that Hollywood produces mainly not so good movies. By turning the spotlight on Hollywood, which is admittedly a good target, Mr. Waters inadvertently shines it on his own movie.",1016323200,9,2539,4.799086757990867

He satirizes the self-righteousness of independent filmmakers who are willing to die for their art, as well as Hollywood hacks who make movies only to make money.  This movie also has more references to other films - mostly fictitious - than any other movie in film history! Melanie Griffith stars as Honey Whitlock, the Hollywood diva who is in Baltimore for the premier of her latest movie.  It's a sappy, romantic comedy entitled ""Some Kind Of Happiness."" The crazed Cecil (Stephen Dorff) and his gang of outlaw filmmakers, called the Sprocket Holes, kidnap her. They force her to star in their ultimate reality film called ""Raving Beauty.""

The star of that adult film just happens to be one of the Sprocket Holes, Cherish, lustily played by Alicia Witt. My favorite scene is when they invade the set of ""Gump Again,"" which is being filmed in Baltimore. Kevin Nealon, taking over for Tom Hanks in the sequel, delivers the best line in the movie.

People have given this atrocity of filmmaking higher marks in part because of it being an underground film.  This is totally absurd because if a movie is bad it is bad regardless of its budget.  I want to set the record straight by saying I despise the type of huge budget Hollywood Twinkie movies that are made fun of in this movie.  But, what I despise even more are unendurably bad movies that try and get by on being art films or underground films.
In some ways it is impossible to describe why Cecil B. Demented is so bad.  It features scene transitions that belong on the Fox Family Channel.  It has terrible dialogue, the acting is sub par, the plot is crap (sorry, there is no better way to descibe it), the action and portrayal of the police as merciless killers are so absurd that they almost made me cry, and finally any movie that uses the word horny as much as this movie did (it seems like they say it every other sentence) could not possibly deserve more than two stars.

1390465,4,B000053V7C,"All you ""movie lovers"" out there who are the genuine article, prepare to laugh - HARD!  In ""Cecil B. Demented,"" famed off-Hollywood filmmaker John Waters has turned his attention to a subject that is obviously near and dear to his heart, and, in fact, near and dear to the hearts of all true lovers of movies everywhere.  In his latest wild comedy, he has tackled the seemingly irreconcilable conflict that exists between the worlds of big budget mainstream Hollywood moviemaking and low budget, renegade independent cinema - a conflict that the latter always seems unfairly and unfailingly to lose.  Waters certainly knows whereof he speaks - he, himself of course, being one of the great pioneers and icons of the underground film movement.  He launched his directorial career and made a name for himself in independent film circles way back in the 1970's with such crude landmark underground classics as ""Pink Flamingoes"" and ""Female Trouble."" Since that time, he has himself received some heat from diehard indie film purists who have considered him something of a sellout for producing offbeat but decidedly more ""commercial"" works like ""Hair Spray,"" ""Cry Baby"" and ""Serial Mom, "" often with big name actors and actresses in starring roles.  Yet, even with this more polished sheen, Waters' films have always retained that quality of outrageousness and that willingness to push the envelope that distinguish his vision from that of more mainstream filmmakers.
""Cecil B. Demented"" is a particularly funny film for those who share Waters' outrage at the mass audience's seeming preference for the bland unoriginality of much of the product churned out by the cinema factory known as Hollywood and its seeming dismissal of the cutting edge experimentation and originality that define so much of independent filmmaking.  And he lambastes a money-hungry industry that is all too eager and willing to supply the public with the big budget, special effects-ridden pablum it seems to crave.  Or is it - in classic chicken-or-egg fashion - really the STUDIOS that condition the audience into thinking that those are the films that they want to spend their hard earned money to see?  At any rate, Waters' clever parody follows a Patty Hearst-type storyline (as usual, Patty Hearst herself appears in the film) in which a group of bizarre, renegade independent filmmakers kidnap a Hollywood starlet (Melanie Griffith at her most likable) then force her to star in their reality-based new film which involves them filming themselves as they storm, guns blazing, into theatres that are showing putrid mainstream films, all in a righteous effort to bring commercial cinema to its knees.
""Cecil B. Demented"" provides a rapid-fire onslaught of clever inside jokes lampooning both mainstream and independent filmmaking.  Although his heart obviously lies with the latter, Waters also can remain objective enough to skewer some of the self-righteous pretentiousness that occasionally creeps into that type of filmmaking as well (he even shows that, as a director, he is damn good at staging one of those slick car chases he professes to abhor).  Yet, as this clever parody plays itself out, most of us watching the film can't help but nod our heads in amused agreement with much of what he is showing us.  In addition to the jokes themselves, Waters provides amusement with his sharply delineated comic characters each of whom satirizes a different aspect of the renegade subculture.  We have, for instance, the maniacal, fanatical, single-minded director (delightfully played by Stephen Dorff) who sees himself as nothing less than the messiah sent to destroy commercial filmmaking and erect a cinema based on iconoclasm and originality in its place.  We have all his devoted followers who run the gamut from Satanists to porn stars to punk rockers to straight hairdressers to gay truck drivers etc.  Without question, much of the zestful energy that propels this madcap film forward comes from the dead-on performances of the actors and actresses in these roles.
Energy and originality are in fact the hallmarks of this film from start to finish.  ""Cecil B. Demented"" may not be Waters at his most outrageous, but it provides loads of pleasure for film lovers who have been thinking many of the same thoughts that only Waters, in his uniquely humorous way, could effectively get across.

He watches the performances of his &#8220;Sprocket Holes&#8221; (his acting troupe) with a Twinkle in his Crazed eyes, much like the twinkle in Johnny Depp's eye in the film &#8220;Ed Wood&#8221;, a director that Demented would Definitely get Along with. Dorff also looks Mighty Cool with that Bottle Blonde hair and that Concoction of Clothing. Melanie Griffith was a Inspired Casting Decision; her Persona fits the Role like a Glove, Aging Starlet on the Downward Slope of her Career. She seems to be having a lot of Fun with the role, I was waiting for her to Break out in Laughter at some points.
The Supporting cast are Equally as Dedicated to the cause at hand, and there performances strike the same balance between Real and Comic. Alicia Witt is Hilarious and has Never looked so [Good]. Jack Noseworthy is Always good and he has one of the Films Funniest scenes, where her Expresses his feelings about his Confused Sexuality. The Rest of the cast is filled with Actors who I Know by Face but not by Name, what I Do know is that they are all Great. The Films Casting Agents did a Wonderful Job.
The film is Definitely not for Everyone, but if you Ever found yourself Cursing a Big Budget film or Crying in a film that is so Sickly Sentimental that you feel Tricked, &#8220;Cecil B Demented&#8221; knows how you feel and he has the Remedy.",991612800,,2338,4.746928746928747
1390469,5,B000053V7C,"The porn fans have been overwhelmingly applauded and it's my time to say that more credit is due the action film fans who jabbed and kicked against the censor moms' pursuit of the filmmakers. It's great that a singular ambition to make a film that includes street chases with the door open and cameras rolling, artillery, white hot hair treatments, and family valuations from one to the next ends in a fiery explosion, where out like a brief candle a selfless artisan bids goodbye world and warps the minds of generations to follow.",991526400,,532,4.731182795698925
1390470,4,B000053V7C,"Mainstream movies and the studio system, as well as independent films and filmmakers, are sliced, diced, hammered and shredded by writer/director John Waters in his biting and funny satire, ""Cecil B. Demented,"" starring Stephen Dorff and Melanie Griffith.  Railing against convention and adamant in his quest, a young man who wants to make a statement about bad movies, the way they're made, those who participate in these cinematic transgressions and those who flock to theaters to see the final product, dubs himself ""Cecil B. Demented"" and sets out to make a ""real"" indie film.  Toward this end, he assembles a group of like-thinking would-be filmmakers and forms them into a lethal band of cinematic guerrillas he names the ""Sprocket Holes,"" and has them take jobs at and infiltrate a theater in Baltimore that is about to hold a lavish premiere of a new movie featuring Hollywood star Honey Whitlock (Griffith).  Honey herself is scheduled to attend, and Demented's plan is to kidnap her and force her to star in his film, which will be shot ""ambush"" style, intruding upon real people and situations, rolling film and getting it in the can before anyone knows what happened.  He hopes.  Dedicated to making the kind of movie that should be made, the Sprocket Holes are not only willing to die for their art, but go so far as to take a vow to remain chaste until the film is completed.
 ""Demented"" is by turns outrageous, violent and hilarious, and-- some would say, subjectively speaking-- that Waters pushes the envelope of good taste to the limit.  But then again, he usually does, and it usually works.  Anyone who knows John Waters' movies knows what to expect (indeed, anticipate), but those who come to his work unawares may be in for a jaw-dropping eye opener.  When satire is done well it can cut both ways; this one is, and it does.  Movies made by the studios for no other purpose than to make a buck, and which contain no artistic merit whatsoever are the obvious target of Waters' barrage, but so are the ""auteur,"" legends-in-their-own-minds ""indie"" filmmakers with a penchant for taking themselves too seriously.  Along the way,  Waters is having a laugh at himself, even as he laughs along with his fellow filmmakers at both ends of the spectrum, those at whom his shots are being fired.
 As Demented, Dorff takes a somewhat over-the-top and highly energized approach to the character, in a performance punctuated with exclamation points.  But he leaves no doubt in the mind of the viewer that he IS Cecil B. Demented.  And you know that come what may, there's going to be no stopping him.  Griffith, meanwhile, adds a nice touch as Honey, a character through whom we see all the transparencies of a Hollywood ""star,"" whose career has never been hampered by bad acting.  Inured of a caustic and ego driven personality, she nevertheless manages to garner some sympathy as the story moves along and her vulnerable side is exposed.  Griffith is  perfect for the part, which is something of a good natured nudge in the ribs of her own image.  As intended, it's just another instance of Waters pulling aside the curtain to reveal what is really behind the facade.
 In a supporting role, Alicia Witt gives a memorable performance as Cherish, the porn star who sees her co-starring role with Honey in Demented's film as a way of legitimizing her career, while at the same time thumbing her nose at the industry that has for so long shunned her ""talents.""  The additional supporting cast includes Adrian Grenier (Lyle), Larry Gilliard Jr. (Lewis), Maggie Gyllenhaal (Raven), Jack Noseworthy (Rodney), Michael Shannon (Petie), Harriet Dodge (Dinah), Zenzele Uzoma (Chardonnay), Eric M. Barry (Fidget), Erika Lynn Rupli (Pam), Mink Stole (Mrs. Mallory), Patty Hearst (Fidget's Mother), Ricki Lake (Libby) and Kevin Nealon (Himself).  A film that will definitely get your attention, ""Cecil B. Demented"" sets pretentiousness on it's ear by saying what most people think but rarely say due to the constraints of social protocol.  Waters crosses some lines and doesn't pull any punches with this one, which may make it a bit hard for some to take; but movie lovers in general, and aficionados of independent film especially, should get a real kick out of it.  It may be a bit skewed, but it's all a part of the magic of the movies.",986947200,6,4336,4.866666666666666

1390472,3,B000053V7C,"This is one of a small but growing number of movies that are improved by their Director's Commentary track.  By itself this is far from my favorite Waters movie. Like most of his stuff after 'Hairspray', it's got about 1 1/2 points to make and it makes them over and over and over.  The characters have little of the color of his best - they each have one defining trait and that's about it.  Worst of all, it's not particularly funny.  But Waters is a great talker, and his affection for his cast and story makes me feel a little more kindly toward the movie as a whole.  I do wonder about a couple of his comments however...  At one point he says he wanted Stephen Dorff for the movie because he thought he wouldn't camp Cecil up, that he'd make him into someone you'd want to be a fan of.  But I always thought campiness was a large part of of John Waters' characters.  Aside from maybe 'Hairspray', the folks in his movies aren't anything like real people, they're cartoon characters - some of the most well-drawn, wonderfully campy cartoon characters ever.  And since most of Cecil's part is screaming rhetoric at everybody there's absolutely no human core to get at - he ain't real, and sadly, I have no desire to be his fan.  Also, John, the way you go on about how you saw all Stephen's movies reveals the real reason you chose him - because you obviously think he's a cutie...  What's wrong with admitting that?",983750400,,1420,4.423076923076923
1390473,4,B000053V7C,"First off, I would like to say BRAVO to John Waters...  Thisman is one of the all time best film makers..  his films aim to shock,entertain and to stimulate your brain..  Unlike a lot of hollywoodsfluff films, Cecil B.  Demented follows in the footsteps of Waters'other films..  while my favorites are still Hairspray and PinkFlamingos, this film had something..  Stephen Dorff plays Cecil, anindie film director with a cast, a dream, a star, and a gun..  Thestar is played by Melanie Griffith (Honey Whitlock), a hollywoodstarlet who plays in fluff films that many don't even find to be goodfluff films..  the cast is rounded out by some rising stars and somefuture finds..  Alicia Witt (Cherish, an ex porn star with a past) mayhave become a household name with teenage boys in Urban Legend, but inDemented she makes her mark on Hollywood..  Adrian Grenier plays Lyle,a guy who used to have problems until he found drugs, and now he onlyhas one, ""they gave my life real focus"".  the rest of thecast includes a teenage runaway who likes to play pocket pool, asatanist with great potential to be a salesperson at the cliniquecounter in your local shopping mall, and a hairdresser who is ashamedof his heterosexuality..  Waters succeeds in making yet another filmto add to the pile of refuse and dog feces that has made his career ahigh point in my life..  Cecil B. Demented FOREVER!!!",982627200,4,1384,4.863247863247863
