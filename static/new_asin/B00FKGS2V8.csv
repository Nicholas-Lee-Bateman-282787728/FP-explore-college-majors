5994703,2,B00FKGS2V8,Only two of the three episodes from Season One are on this disk. Apparently one was omitted because of some copyright issue involving music. This omission was not made clear in the item description.,1390521600,48,198,4.852941176470588

8616304,1,B00FKGS2V8,"Pilot was the most unpleasant and disturbing 44 minutes I've ever watched. Physically made me sick. Bestiality is not enjoyable, the writer has the mind of a 12 year old. Unbelievable, poorly acted, not funny, not good drama, no clever twist, absolutely no point to this, and it won Emmy? 0 Stars.",1505952000,,297,4.730769230769231
8616305,1,B00FKGS2V8,Would not play.  Description stated it would play with US bluray player.  Very disappointed,1470873600,4,91,5.428571428571429
8616306,1,B00FKGS2V8,"The listing says it will work in A1 region BLU-RAY players, it does not. This seems like a bootleg as its missing one of the episodes as well. Season 1 has 3 episodes, Episode #2 is missing from this disk. Because the disk wouldn't play in any blu-ray player we have there is no way to know if this was a bootleg copy of the 2 episodes from the internet or other outside sources. Quite a bummer as this was a gift.",1451692800,6,414,4.060975609756097
8616307,3,B00FKGS2V8,I was disappointed because it was all subtitled.,1430092800,2,48,5.125
8616308,1,B00FKGS2V8,"I heard that this show is a must see.  After watching all three episodes of series 1 I have to disagree and go just short of saying it's a must miss.  The first episode is disturbing, revolting and a truly dark start to what I thought would be a series I would really appreciate.  Unfortunately the second episode was extremely tedious, slow and boring.  The writer was obviously trying make a larger commentary on our reality TV culture but it was on a par with what a high school writer would think is profound.  Same goes for the third episode.  This storytelling is not groundbreaking or even creative.  It is pedestrian at best.  I have no comment on the quality of the disc as I watched these episodes streaming on Netflix in the US, but I felt I must comment about the content of the episodes because I do not understand the reason for the universal acclaim that I am hearing about this show.  For reviewers who say that only 2 of the 3 episodes are included on this disc, I hope for the purchaser's sake that it it includes the episode about the Prime Minister.  If either episode 2 or 3 are missing, consider yourself lucky (especially episode 2).  Series 2 is also available fo streaming on Netflix in the US but I will not be wasting my time.",1421452800,3,1253,4.404347826086957
8616309,1,B00FKGS2V8,"NOT AS DESCRIBED: ""SEASON ONE""

This is a series, and each season only has three episodes. This is the ONLY commercially produced Blu-Ray content of this series - ONE season - and of that season, it only has TWO episodes.

Pretty misleading and abysmal.

8616310,1,B00FKGS2V8,"Per the description, this Blu-ray Disc should have worked in our blu-ray player, but it doesn't (and we tried more than one player)... looks like they deliberately mislead customers on the Regions thing... :(",1395532800,20,208,5.147058823529412
