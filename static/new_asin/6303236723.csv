The ending of THIS movie will DEFINITELY be a jaw  dropper!  I just hope they come out with a ""BrainScan Part II""  to this movie!  I've been looking for the vcd of it, but have had no luck.

617623,5,6303236723,"BrainScan was by far the best movie released in 1994.  The character played by Edward Furlong is a teenaged boy having difficulty adjusting to the death of his mother. Along with the average problems of being a  teenager Furlong's character would rather be behind a computer playing  games than out at the local teen hang out.  As a senior in highschool when  this movie was released I was able to connect with the Furlong character on  a personal level.  This connection that I was able to make along with the  quality of acting and directing made BrainScan number two on my list of  best movies of all time.  If anyone cares my number one of all time is  Hackers.  Another movie I was able to connect with due to the computer  influence, as a IT profesional computer movies rank high on my list.",946425600,2,797,4.489510489510489

618230,5,6303236723,"Searching around on On Demand's Fearnet for some good nostalgic horror movies to check out and they had Brainscan on the list, so I checked it out and I love it!

Edward Furlong (John Connor from Terminator 2) stars as Michael Brower, a lonely high school student who's a horror movie addict. His best friend, Kyle, is also a horror addict just like him. Kyle tells Michael about a new horror game called Brainscan that gives the player a POV feeling that they're playing a real game and allows them to kill people. Michael takes interest in the game and orders it through the mail, which is where the problems begin. When the game arrives, a weird monster like man by the name of Trickster appears and convinces Michael to play the game, to which he reluctantly agrees. Michael teleports into the game where he kills a man while he was sleeping and cuts of his foot. Turns out that the man was real and was a local in the neighborhood, but Michael doesn't know that......yet until he finds the foot in his freezer the next day and hears about the murder on the news.

Trickster lures Michael into playing the following discs of the game to manage to keep his name cleared of any suspicion from the police. When Kyle and his next door neighbor crush, the cutie, Kimberly end up getting tangled in up in all the drama, their lives are put at risk with the video game and Michael doesn't even know it! What was supposed to be a simple and fun video game has now become a hellacious nightmare for young Michael who has no choice but to play the game until the end, whether he wants to or not and manage to keep him from being in trouble with the law at the same time. For each level of the game Michael is in, he has a limited amount of time to complete it. The only possible way out of the game is if he fails to kill the selected victim during the allotted time he's given. Will he succeed?

Overall: A pretty good horror film. It's more along the lines of psychological than bloody or scary but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie to watch. Edward Furlong showcases his great acting skills as the lonely cool kid, while T. Ryder Smith delivers as the creepy demonoid monster, The Trickster The plot is original, the acting is decent, and it tells a great story beginning, middle, and end. The end of the movie comes down to the obvious 2 it was expected to come down to but takes a complete cool twist that no one probably saw coming. If you're looking for a movie that will give you a scare, skip this. But if you want a movie that has a great plot and tells the story to perfection, choose Brainscan.",1401235200,,2612,4.337423312883436

618311,5,6303236723,I've watched this once on tv and fell for this movie so much instantly. I even watched it on youtube and put it in a playlist so I can see it all the time now I have the DVD yesssss thank you so much,1367712000,,199,3.5454545454545454
618312,5,6303236723,"The parts of the movie that seem to confuse or make the viewer wonder what was real or just a game were the scenes with the dog carrying a foot in its mouth, both in the beginning of the movie and the end of the movie. Also, at the ending of the movie, where we see Trickster in real life.

What I wonder is if it's possible that he's still playing the game at the end, but thinking that he's actually back in regular ""reality"". Sort of like how when he's playing the game and he's thinking it's reality, but it's really the game he's still in, sort of like another trick in the game to make him think it's all real. If the game was interfacing with his subconscious to somehow put that theme of murder crimes into the game from when he first came across the crime scene earlier in his ""reality"", how would the dog with the foot in his mouth walking in the ending credits, and the beginning credits make sense?...because if Michael didn't see the dog walking with the severed foot in the beginning, then why would the same dog with the foot be in the games reality, but then be back in regular reality after he had finished the game? I would assume then, that it's still because he's in the game reality. But that doesn't necessarily make sense either, because the movie starts out with the dog running with the foot in his mouth, and we are to assume that this is the real ""reality"" that Michael is in before he has ever played Brainscan before. But how is it possible for the exact same dog with the foot in his mouth from the game to be in reality AND to be in the game as well, especially if Michael had never seen the dog with the foot in real life (this would mean that his subconscious mind couldn't have fed that to the game). It's basically like, which dog is real? The beginning dog or the ending dog? They try to make one seem like it existed in reality and the other was just in the game. But how is it possible for the exact dog with a severed foot in it's mouth to be in both places, without any connection or reason to be? And also, if he had finished playing the game, why would he be seeing Trickster in regular reality? Was it just his own projection or imagination? Was Trickster somehow real? Was he still in the game, but duped into thinking the game was over? Was any of it real? Or is the game just making people delusional to where they don't know or can't tell what is real or not? Or, could the game be spilling over into reality, via the hypnotic techniques it uses on the gamer's subconscious and using real life people to do it's own maniacal deeds and give the Trickster his own life (in people's minds)? In essence, who's being played? The game or the gamer?

So, my theory is this. The whole movie IS the game, Brainscan. WE the viewers are in essence, Michael. We are playing the ""game"" by watching the movie, just like he does when he puts the game Brainscan in and thinks that it's real life, but it's just the game. The clue would be the dog with the foot in the beginning. If we presume that the dog from the brainscan game in the beginning of the movie was really from the game ""reality"", NOT real reality (in the movie's reality) then the whole thing was a game and that's how the movie let's us know that. It also tells us that at the end credits, where it stops and the dog comes up to the screen with the foot and Trickster's voice says ""you forgot something"", which is directed at the viewer, so this would imply that we just played the game brainscan by watching the movie. If you only look at the movie in the context of is the reality in the movie real, or is the game reality real, then this theory probably may not apply. Unless you step further back and look at it as if you were the gamer putting in this movie and it's a simulation where we are like Michael's character, viewing it from his point of view, sort of how he does while playing Brainscan.

So, next time you watch this movie, pretend that YOU ARE Michael, and playing Brainscan the game, not just watching the movie. It may make more sense.",1364601600,2,4053,4.240620957309185

618412,5,6303236723,"Edward Furlong plays Michael, a neglected, horror loving teenager those outside his circle might describe as creepy. He has the latest computer technology of his day (1994), and when it comes to horror-themed computer games, he's played 'em all. So, Michael is pretty unimpressed when his best friend, Kyle, tells him about ""Brainscan"", a new video game advertised in Fangoria Magazine promising horror thrills like never before. Still, ever bored with his teen-angsty frustrations (like spying on the hottie-hot-hottie next door, Kimberly, if you like the girl next door type, which I happen to like best), Michael finally decides to give Brainscan a try. Unlike anything he's played before, it uses a technique ""similar to hypnosis"", creating a virtual reality experience in mindless violence and murder at a level Michael never could have expected. The only problem is, once the game has been played, you have to keep playing till the game is finished, and whenever Michael plays a round, it seems someone around him has died.

""Brainscan"" is a unique and clever, but sadly overlooked horror film from 1994, directed by the late John Flynn. Its story and the intended source of horror, in my opinion, lies in Michael's unintentional acts of murder, fear of being caught by a hard detective played by the always great Frank Langella, and the pressure he is under to reluctantly commit more crimes, causing him to feel completely hopeless in the situation and slowly driving him to madness. However, most viewers seem to focus their attention on ""Trickster"" (played by T. Ryder Smith), a game-host character who appears to Michael more and more, urging him to keep playing, and who perhaps puts many in mind of a not so scary but slightly more annoying Freddy Krueger. Here lies a problem Brainscan has with much of its audience, and I think the problem with folks wanting Trickster to be scary (and complaining that he isn't): he's not supposed to be very scary. I see him as more of a mythological trickster type character with a taste for the more horrific. Think along the lines of the tricksters on ""Supernatural"" or ""Q"" on ""Star Trek the Next Generation"", or Superman's old nemesis, Mr. Mxyzptlk; all tricksters with near limitless powers, and Brainscan's Trickster just seems to be a really horrible one who gets great entertainment from murder and messin' with people's heads. Then again, that's if he is real at all, and the film doesn't make that totally clear. But, my point is, he's not the guy going around doing the killing here, and he's not supposed to be all that scary. Someone like Freddy Krueger trying to be all buddy-buddy with Michael wouldn't play off as well as it does with a slightly goofy but creepy enough looking/acting freakazoid like the Trickster. Another problem some folks might have with this film is the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but this sort of ending works in some films, and I think it works very well here. The only bit I didn't like (because it makes no sense) is the very tiny bit tacked on during the end credits involving the German Shepherd.

Putting aside the issues that some folks don't like the kind of ending ""Brainscan"" has, and many folks seemed to want it to be a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" kind of film, which is totally not what it is supposed to be, ""Brainscan"", as it is, is a really interesting and fun ride. There's some goofball, '90's kind of stuff, but this is more like some of the classic supernatural horror of the 80's than most of the stuff we've gotten since the 80's, and yet it's not something I felt I had seen before. I'm really glad I stumbled upon the DVD recently, which I didn't even know existed. I had never forgotten this film since I first saw it in theaters shortly before starting college, partially because I always thought Amy Hargreaves (Kimberly) was a hottie in it (apparently, she was 24 when she made it, though playing 16), but also because it's such a fun flick. I just cannot believe it's already nearly 16 years old. Sadly, the DVD is bare bones, and the trailers it carries do not include one for the film. But, at least it's anamorphic widescreen, and I'm just happy to have discovered that it is even available!

618416,3,6303236723,"After Terminator 2 - Judgment Day was released, alot of people thought computer monsters would be movies of the future. Alot of them went straight to video and are barely remembered, some went to theaters but never did much. I remember seeing this movie preview when I was younger and it freaked me out, and I finally bought it on dvd. I previewed the trailer again after buying it and thought ""ut oh, i bought a crapfest."" They do have T2 star Edward Furlong, which I guess at thus time was still considered a star. I thought the downfall of the movie was the Trickster, who was enjoyable but didn't really flesh out to be a villian and the cop he run into alot, should have had a slightly bigger part. Furlong is perfect in his role as a bored teen who loves metal, video games, and horror films. The downfall is the rest of the cast falls flat. A few good scenes are scattered about but nothing exciting. The ending started off as crap but the real ending was enjoyable but I guess. This film is watchable a few times but I wouldnt rank it as a top film.",1214265600,,1057,4.29
618417,4,6303236723,"If Brainscan were released today, there's absolutely no doubt it would be straight to video, but the early 90s still rocked coz the direct to video market wasn't so huge then and fun little horror flicks like this still got theatrical releases(Hell, Leprechaun did.  Even Leprechaun 2!).  Brainscan has Edward Furlong as a loner horror film obsessed metalhead teen who decides to spice life up a bit by ordering a new horror video game from Fangoria.  It's interactive!!  It puts Eddie in a kind of trance where he believes he's committed a senseless, random killing.  After the game, he's totally psyched about it until he finds out that the murder actually happened.  Soon he's visited by Trickster, a kind of metalhead demon that emerges from his t.v.  Trickster convinces Furlong to play the rest of the discs in the series.  Ya see, each disc has a catch that traps the player into having to play the next disc or risk getting caught by the police.  This includes destroying evidence and even murdering witnesses.  Soon Furlong is nearing the end of his rope.  His best friend ditches him, the police are starting to snoop around, but on the positive side he does seem to be finally establishing a relationship with his neighbor who he has a secret crush on.  So, how does Furlong pull himself out of this trap and get the girl of his dreams?  Can he even do it?  The answer is actually a very satisfying one if you ask me.  I really liked the way this movie ended, though some don't.
On the acting front, Furlong is Furlong.  The guy looks and talks like he's stoned in just about everything I've seen him in, and this is no exception.  Frank Langella isn't given much to do other than be a snoopy detective, but he does it with style.  He's a rather underused actor if you ask me.  Amy Hargreaves is decent enough.  She's no knockout, but that is what I loved.  She's just cute enough to look like a real high school girl a young man might have a crush on rather than the fake supermodel types that tend to creep into these movies.  Alot of flak is given to T. Ryder Smith, or just the character of Trickster in general.  The character is usually seen as an annoying poor man's Freddy Krueger.  Well, I liked him.  The technology in this film, both the effects and the equipment in Furlong's room might seem ancient already, but it was a product of the day.  That stuff was state of the art at the time, right there at the beginning of CD-ROM.  It's kinda neat to see it actually, and it shows how far we've come in so short of time.  Although I don't think the doodad Furlong uses as his telephone exists yet, at least not quite the way he uses it.  Maybe I'm wrong about that though.  Brainscan remains a fun little gem to rediscover, it does still deliver the goods for the horror fan.  It's directed by the same guy who gave us the Steven Seagal opus, Out For Justice.  And who on earth didn't love that film?",1204934400,3,2920,4.440677966101695

That being said, I don't really want to see him as scary because, to me, this movie isn't about being scared. To me this is a great nineties gem that reminds me of all the horror media I enjoyed growing up. Granted it's rated R and is a tad more extreme (being that it is brought to you by the same man who brought a movie about the seedy underground pornography industry [8mm]), but to me, it still has the same appeal of an are you afraid of the dark or a goosebumps. The kind of story that is somewhat of mix between friday the 13th, and stand by me.

  Part my attraction lies in that the protagonist is a horror obsessed computer nerd, whom I resembled at more than one point in my life. I can relate to this kid of many levels and I guess I longed for an adventure like this to come along and sweep me up

  No this isn't an epic, it's a movie of the week, but it's very sentimental to those of us who remember having the time of our lives reading a goosebumps or watching an are you afraid of the dark. If nothing more, the appeal of this movie lies in the less than popular kid getting the girl and having a few creepy encounters along the way. That story,no matter how many times told, will always draw my interest.

  So I guess this is to me what back to the future/ star wars is to many others. They can have that. I'll take my brainscan",1153612800,18,1479,4.072413793103448

The background music was the worst part, its more low budget than Friday 13th, although i loooved Friday 13th, Jason rocks!!! But lets face it the music was a bit annoying

It delivers in every facet of movie making.  Each of the main characters owns his role so thoroughly that the viewer can't imagine anyone else doing it.  The cinematography is lush, the sound is riveting, and the pacing is so tense it's almost painful.

It is everything good that this sort of surrealist phantasy usually isn't.  It is mind-blowingly weird, yet each step of the plot follows step like an equation.  No character is a one-dimensional cartoon.  Frank Langella manages to be ominous and sympathetic.  Edward Furlong does the alienated teen bit but with a moral sense rare for that kind of part.

There are even scenes which are painfully gruesome to watch which yet leave the viewer chuckling when the movie is over in the same way that a really improbable punch line makes a joke memorable.

618492,3,6303236723,"I liked Brainscan when I was younger but it seems a bit dated now, even for a film made in 1994. It just makes such a big deal out of CD-ROM technology. I guess the only game out back then was Myst.

Michael Brower (Furlong) is a lonely kid. His mother is dead and his dad is often away on long business trips leaving him alone in his attic bedroom with his massive computer station big enough to be the Skynet system core (one presumes his dad is computer salesman or something). Horror movies are his obsession and spying on his would-be girlfriend next door breaks up the day. For him, life is easier when seen through a TV rather than dealing with it up front.

His attention is drawn to an ad in Fangoria, a video game called Brainscan which promises the ultimate high in interactive gaming. It's a horror game that is so real it'll chill your blood etc etc. Michael is sceptical but goes along with it anyway. He dials the number and gets his (apparently free) Brainscan disc.

The object of the game is to kill and that's exactly what Michael does. He's sent into a state of deep hypnosis through the TV and wakes up on his ultimate killing high. So THIS is what it feels like to be Jason Voorhees!

Trouble is it appears that Michael really is killing people and when he tries to shut the game down wonderfully mad character called The Trickster pops out of the TV and involves himself in conversations regarding the nature of horror that become a bit too philosophical.

Brainscan ends with a plot twist that is quite ingenius and caught me totally off-guard the first time I saw it. However, a couple of plot points that occur after this make no sense and throw the whole logic of the plot into confusion. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker (the very man who gave us Se7en and 8mm) you can expect there to be a certain tightness to the structure of the film but it seems to be to small and restricted for it's own good. If more opportunities created by the bizarre story were explored and fleshed out it could have been a great film instead of only being a good one.

The Brainscan DVD is in average looking 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with average Dolby 2.0 sound. The region 1 disc is really the only way to go as the Region 2 is in crappy fullscreen. Neither have any features. Don't pay more than 5 bucks this if you really want it.",1106956800,2,2343,4.374712643678161
618493,2,6303236723,"Edward Furlong (Pecker, Pet Semetary 2) stars as Michael, a horror movie and game junkie who when he was a kid was in a horrific accident which ended up with the death of his mother. Furlong is all alone at his house with his father on vacation, he reads in a issue of Fangoria about a game called BrainScan..a terrifying reality game. He orders it and when it gets there he experiences the realistic feel of the game about seeing threw the eyes of a serial killer. Soon things spiral down as he finds out that the murder actually happened and from there things don't go so well. Furlong is even visited by the creator of BrainScan, a poofy mullet haired virtual creature named Trixter, T Rider-Smith. Frank Langella (Masters Of The Universe (The He-man Movie), The Ninth Gate) plays the suspicious cop on the murder cases who suspects Furlong for the murders. Interesting premise wasted in the dull script but the actors and the diretor try their best with the corny material. Furlong in one of his pubescent breakout roles is ok but doesnt cut it like I said. Langella is wasted..I was expecting him to turn into Skeletor and break stuff. T Rider Smith has his moments with Trixter but it's hard to keep a straight face when he looks like a mutated troll doll with pimped out attire that matches the dye of his hair.

618494,5,6303236723,"Oh, man, I love this movie.  It's not perfect, but it takes such a fresh and juicy approach to horror that I can only wonder why more horror fans haven't feasted of the virtual flesh that is Brainscan.  Sure, the climax of the film is predictable, and the plot requires the mega-indulgence of your imagination, and the final, final twist is something of a letdown (of little importance), but this film has pizzazz and originality, a heavy rocking soundtrack, and a genuine element of creepiness that flowed through my veins like liquid nirvana.

Edward Furlong of T2 fame plays Michael Bower, a rather solitary computer nerd of a teenager who lives in a world of horror films, computer games, and rock music; like many a horror fanatic, he is always on the lookout for the ultimate horror experience (although, as typically happens, he's afraid to make a move on the girl next door whom he secretly pines for).  He sounds a lot like me, actually, but this kid has an awesome computer system (especially for 1994) which includes a virtual assistant named Igor.  When his best (and only) bud tells him about this new interactive game called Brainscan (dude, it's advertised in Fangoria), he calls up the number and soon finds himself engaged in an experience he was not prepared for.  The first disk promises him a realistic experience of killing from the viewpoint of the killer himself.  Don't get hung up on the details because he basically just sits there and the game sends out some kind of special hypnotic waves toward his brain or something.  Anyway, he's pretty stoked about the experience until he learns that a local man was actually murdered in an identical fashion - it was supposed to be just a computer game.  Naturally, he starts to freak out a little bit, but the friendly Brainscan mastermind is there to help him.  Trickster (T. Ryder Smith) even keeps popping into his room in some kind of magically electronic fashion to guide (more like compel, actually) him through the other three game disks - he has to take care of witnesses, you see.  Meanwhile, the law is circling in on him, he doesn't know what's real and what's not, and he's basically forced to keep playing the game.  We all know who the last victim will be, of course, but we have to wait and see whether he can go through with the final kill.  The ultimate conclusion comes as no surprise because there is really only one way to end a film such as this, but it was pulled off fairly well, throwing in a couple of elements that seemed a little left of center.

This was not some high-budget theatrical production, and that's fine - in fact, more money would probably have ruined this film.  The acting isn't the best in the world, although Furlong improves as he goes along, Amy Hargreaves has that cute girl next door thing working to perfection, and T. Ryder Smith is an absolute joy to watch in the role of Trickster.  Some mysteries are left a little murky, such as those about a trauma in Michael's past, and much of the secrets of the game play itself are basically just ignored, but there's no need to overanalyze this gloriously over-the-top film.  I was a little annoyed at first by the darkness of the film print, but I soon concluded that this was a good thing; Brainscan really should be watched in the dark.  Just sit back, give yourself over completely to the film, and reap the rewards of this ingeniously different kind of horror/science fiction/suspense classic.

Finally, I have to throw out some kudos to the makers of this film for including Zak the dog in the credits; Zak had a significant albeit supporting role in the film, but this canine earned his money and certainly deserved credit for his work.",1090713600,22,3706,4.647779479326187
618495,4,6303236723,"When 'Scream' made it big, it was a huge shock that rocked the waves of America...and certainly Hollywood studios. It was a rarity that a horror film was actually a success. Not since the 80's had there been such a huge run for horror films. Freddy, to most fans, was dead. As was Jason and Michael. Yet...everything suddenly came back.

  Mind you that was 1996, December of 1996, and things before then for horror was very different. In the year, 1994, a science fiction horror film called 'Brainscan' came out. It starred T2's Edward Furlong and was basically underwritten and never heard of. But, either way, success or failure, the film is decent.

  The film is frightening in a way. In a time when 'The Matrix' was never released yet, this film comes off as very original. With the eerie score by George Clinton, not Dr. Funkenstein, and a cold, silver edged directing job, the film runs like a classy horror film. It's not a slasher and it's not campy, it's just a horror film, which is what I think was a lot of what was missing with the horror resurfacing in the late nineties.

  Following Furlong's character, he's been ridden with a different lifestyle than others. A car accident killing his mother and giving himself a limp, after one nasty laceration. What's his escapism? Horror films, of course. He even has his own horror club at school, closed down by the 90's cliche, evil principal(I miss these old cliches). When he reads in a magazine, Fangoria to be precise, of a new type of video game, he must take part. It's called Brainscan, hey! that's the title of the film, and it takes you in for more than a ride. As the game has him as a killer, the cops in his town begin finding his victims. What is reality?

  It's a different film and it's not for everyone. It's a classic in my book. From the writing to the acting, it's all not too shabby. In fact, Furlong plays it real well, and the supporting cast follows just as nicely. The real notable addition is the leader of the game, Trixster, as he mixes in that unnerving edge with some comedic performance, as well. The film just brings us back to a different time, where kids wore flannel and listened to Guns and Roses or Mudhoney...and horror movies were untampered with. Either way, it's a movie you either take or leave it.

  The DVD has nothing on it, this is purely for film viewing. It's a bummer, I'd like to see something, even a trailer. But, either way, I enjoy the film and am glad they actually put it out!",1090368000,,2494,4.486725663716814
618496,5,6303236723,"Let me make that very clear. Not everything we put in front of our eyes has to lace up and wear an neck tie to work. Sometimes it's ok to be lowbrow. I mean, JACKASS has a legion of followers, and the show does nothing more than devalue our sensibilities.
With Brainscan, we have a minor production about a boy whose reality is eschewed by a video game. It's over the top, and silly, but it's so much damned fun. I think it's a great movie for what it is. It's not Braveheart or Mystic River, but that fact shouldn't lessen the entertainment value of this cheesy horror film.
If you've purchased this flick on a whim, fear not, you will have a good time. This is the type of movie where you can sit back with a snack, a loved one under you arm, and your feet on the coffee table. A good movie that doesn't have to be great.

what brainscan developed for its time in 1994 was a chance to offer a wide broad of possibilties and to show off his great technolgy of effects, before computer animation was even achievied. and for that is interesting. while it sure lacks a few things in the horror area a bit, it does offer the viewers a chance to become whatever they want in life,although actually not becoming it. as in this case ,furlong is chosen to be a murderer. what will he do, how will he do it, and will he survive?
brainscan offers alot of possiabilties, but in the end, is a fun movie,but,atlas, not a great film. the plot is ok,but thers not enough punched to actually tell something more. is more of a visual effts film, with that being said,enjoy it for what it is. it was cutting edge when i first saw it back, in 1994,but the basis of plot is not to be taken serious. its a horror film,but a fun horror movie at that. although I can said I would recommend this film, right out. it does have its moments to it. a nice scenery, a beautiful next door neighbor, but my rating  then on what i give it still stands,on what i gave it.its not a  really bad film, but more as a misguided one.and for that, i leave to the viewer to chose.",1062633600,,2038,4.5353260869565215

Brainscan brings you into a world that you can immerse yourself in through familiarity. At a time when video games were becomming more complex and lifelike, it took the idea of ""what if"" and ran with it. Now, nearly ten years later this movie doesn't feel too dated.

The plot basically revolves around game in which Furlongs character is playing.  the game makes him think he is killing people.  Furlong gives a decent performance, one of his finest.  Langella gives yet another outstanding one, stealing every scene he is in.  The character of the trickster, a mix of Axel Rose and Freddy Kruger, is about the gayest thing in a movie i've ever seen.  The plot could have used some work no doubt, but every thing else is pretty good.  Check it out if you like horror movies, you'll probably get a kick out of it",985564800,,601,4.5092592592592595
618669,1,6303236723,Please. For me. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. I just wasted an hour and a half of my life that could have been spent cleaning my navel. Maybe if you are under the age of fourteen you might enjoy the triteness of this waste of celluloid. I am definitely dumber now after watching this.,970358400,,278,4.166666666666667
618670,5,6303236723,"When I first heard about this film I thought it was going to be a piece of  garbage. Come on, when Edward Furlong has the lead role you know your in  trouble. The movie revolves around Furlong's character playing a new game  called Brainscan. People then begin dying in the neighborhood, and we are  introduced to the Trickster, who gets Furlong to play the game. The movie  is well-written and the acting is better than you would expect. Also, the  plot twists in the film are a nice touch and will keep you entertained to  the movie's end. I promise that you won't be disapointed with the movie.",966729600,4,597,4.472222222222222
618671,5,6303236723,"Being a student of film I am rather critical at times to movies, back when i was 16 and saw this film at first I was like ok this is going to suck but  it didn't. After my first veiwing I said WOW i have to see that again so I  looked in the Cable guide to see when it was going to be on HBO again. The  movie is awesome. The story is hella good. And I like the way they made the  game....it wasn't some virtual reality headset game or anytyhing like that  but rather hypnosis which made it all the more interesting and it made the  game fit better. Now as to one reveiwer saying HACKERS is better than  this.....Hackers is an UNREALISTIC peice of trash. Sure let's hack into a  system through a phone booth and virtual reality....oh and yes I love how  they think all hackers ride around on rollerblades when they are not  hacking. That in comparison to Brainscan.... Brainscan is TEN times more  realistic . You couldn't save hackers if Angelina Joline were spread eagle  nude in every other scene.....",966124800,3,1004,4.310160427807487
618672,3,6303236723,Brainscan wasn't that bad of a movie.  The movie talked about a teen played by Edward Furlong who gets this game in the mail called Brainscan.  This leads to the apperance of Trickster.  Eventually killings begin.  The  ending has a twist to it.  Buy it today at amazon.com!  Reccomended!,963360000,,288,4.755102040816326

7842688,5,6303236723,"I absolutely love this classic horror movie. And Edward Furlong was sooooo hot and handsome back in 1994 and period back in the 90's I'm a 40 year old woman and what's really really weird but groovy far out cool is we were both born the same year in 1977 my birthday is in August too like his BD is too such great memories of my teenage years too. I'm glad to be old I love being attractive, but I wish I was older than 40.but I'll be 41 in August 24th his birthday is August 2nd he's already older than me today in 2018 but I'll be 41 in another 3 months or a little more it's April 23rd today 2018 so in a few months I'll be 41 don't care to tell me age. Old and proud. To be from an old generation today's teens and generation suck in my opinion. Glad to own Brainscan on dvd I need the soundtrack again too. I used to have it. Great murder mystery classic horror movie. Back when I was a teenager I was 15 years old when Brain scan came out. Love it. ",1524441600,,955,3.922680412371134
