He rented it from the library so many times you wouldn't believe it.  John is autistic so he still goes way back to look at things he liked back then.  We went to the library and they don't have it anymore (John probably wore it out.)  Also, we got a personal message from the seller when we got the item.  VHS tape was in very good condition and brought a smile to John's face. He can tell you about the aventures of Eric and Gary in this story word for word, also what each guy is wearing.  Transaction went perfect.",1299542400,,647,4.0078125

Wish they would come out with this and the 3 other videos(Dinosaurs, Dinosaurs, Dinosaurs; Son of Dinosaur; Prehistoric World) the duo of Gary Owens and Eric Boardman did in the mid 80s, early 90s.",1257292800,,328,4.45
