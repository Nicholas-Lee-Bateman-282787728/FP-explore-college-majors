994828,5,6305110026,"While most of Europe thought that the world was FLAT, Christoper Columbus had a novel idea.  He thought the world was SQUARE, and thus begins this fictional and humorous adventure to discover the new world.  Seen through the eyes of some funny animals and insect friends of Mr. Columbus, this story accurately portrays the important historical facts of the Columbus mission, while infusing enough music and comedy to hold the attention of kids steadfastly and repeatedly.  Featuring a top cast of voice talent, and a stunning orchestral music score, this animated feature from acclaimed filmmakers

Michael Schoemann and Phil Nibbelink has every bit of charm as seen in other films of theirs (i.e., ""We're Back"", ""An American Tale: Fievel Goes West"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"").  I would strongly recommend this for any family with a Dreamworks or Disney animated video collection.",1092009600,3,882,5.226950354609929
