7294726,5,B00ZT7TJHE,"After browsing through prime movies I saw wasteland and since I like apocalypse movies I decided to watch it I am so glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while the acting is amazing and so is the storyline it's a little slow but that's what I like about it it values character development over action for anyone who is sick and tired of Hollywood bull**** and wants a movie with great character development a strong story and characters you care about then watch wasteland and even though the movie is bleak the ending left a ray of hope

Highly recommended",1451606400,10,611,4.407079646017699

7294731,2,B00ZT7TJHE,"The Good: The zombies are believable and the makeup and special effects are pretty good.

The Bad: The angles on this film are horrible. There are so many close ups, out of frame shots, and bad lighting, it was difficult to enjoy the movie. I guess the director was trying to be artistic by getting shots of the actors ears and the backs of their heads, but it didn't work for me. A great portion of this movie was filmed with the characters faces only partially in the frame. Also, its was hard to decipher what the characters were saying, especially when Scott (the main character was on the walkie talkie with another character).

All of that aside, lets discuss the plot. The protagonist, Scott,is one of the few survivors after an apocalypse. The entire movie is about him sitting around waiting for Beth, the girl who turned down his proposal twice. When she finally returns and accepts the third proposal, we find out shes been bitten by a zombie. She turns days later and Scott has to kill her.

With about fifteen minutes to go, Scott stumbles upon a girl whos immune. I absolutely hated the scene where shes playing the violin. Boring and unnecessary. Scott defends her against a horde, and then they walk off into the sunset (also known as France) as the credits roll. As far as zombie movies go, this was just okay. Incidentally, we only got to see one zombie attack toward the end of the movie.",1450742400,3,1407,4.553359683794467

The film follows the formula, he meets some people, kills some zombies and moves on because Dover is where you want to be during a zombie apocalypse.

Yes, it was as boring as it sounds.

7294747,4,B00ZT7TJHE,"I found this film to be rather good. You could tell that it was a low budget flick due to the unknown actors and generally poor animations, but there is a point to be made about that. Generally, most zombie films are relatively low budget when compared to many other genres. These films are almost always poorly done, with the exception of a very select few. The dialogue is almost never there, the action is often poorly choreographed and the characters are generally stereotypical and forgettable. However, this film does not fall into this category. Granted, the explosion at the end is cheesy and probably un-needed but thematically this movie is almost perfect. It follows the story of a gentleman who has lost his lover, which the viewer would not necessarily care about save for the exquisite use of flashbacks. These flashbacks represent a better time to the hero. It kind of makes the viewer not only sympathize but empathize with the main character. Putting yourself in his shoes, you would likely feel the same way. The film then simultaneously shows the trajectory of the main character with his only friend, whom he talks to on a CB radio. This friend, too, represents a break from daily repetition and saves the protagonist from a looming spiral into despair. The symbolism and feeling this movie provides are a testament to the abilities of the director and actors. If one were to give this director a box-office budget, I personally could almost guarantee that he would make major waves in the stagnant industry which we call film.",1474934400,3,1547,4.841509433962264

If you are looking for a deep and introspective look at the human condition at the end of the world... not this movie. It tries to have us learn about Scott and his isolation from everything. The plot, as has been said in other reviews, is kinda tried and true for the genre. The pacing was just insanely slow at points, almost sadistically so and the relationship between the characters was a bit wooden. I think the idea of the film was to highlight one man's journey through his loneliness and his loss and finding a reason to continue. Its been done better, but not everything was terrible, though a few scenes pop out for literal ""WTF?"" moments. Shameer actually did an ok job as the protagonist. The effects were laughably bad, but oddly forgivable considering the apparent lack of a budget. This review is pretty ramble-y.

I love zombie movies, because they all seem to work on more than just the surface level. This movie is an exception, not so much because it doesn't give a deeper story under the action, but because the main action didn't work at all for me.

I think the movie really is about unrequited love. Scott loves Beth completely, nearly obsessively, and seems blind to the extent of her ambivalence. This continues through the apocalypse, during which she walks out on him and leaves him all alone in the middle of the night. He WAITS for her. And waits for her. And waits for her. And that is the plot right up until the last few minutes. I'm going to stop with the explicit spoilers here, because the movie does get better when it finally gets up off its rear end. But I think the underlying theme here has to do with lopsided coupling, where one party is over the moon and the other eventually kind of settles. And what comes after....

I kept trying to relate the title of the movie to its story, and the best I could come up with (since the landscape was lush countryside) was that it refers to Beth and to Scott's idealization of her. For me, focusing on that made the movie kind of work.",1473465600,2,1496,4.242105263157895

Really? he at one point he is in a building with all kinds of tools (axes, poles, a machete hanging on the wall, a hoe, a bunch of pipes but he chooses none of these.

Also, I can't help asking something- Have you ever noticed how guys in zombie movies always seem to find a convenient rock when they're struggling on the ground?  I don't know why this particular thing sticks out for me.
