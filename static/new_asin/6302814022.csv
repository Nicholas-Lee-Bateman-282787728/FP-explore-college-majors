7831991,4,6302814022,"I went to Blockbuster Video and rented this tape, when i saw it, i saw Fred Hickman (pre-More Than A Game) as he guided me to the best plays ever. CNN knew Sports Tonight before it pulled the plug for good. I like him in More Than a Game. It was a great show before Brandi (not shirtless) Chastain took over. You can still see Sports Tonight on CNNSI Cable. May the POD be with you.",1016236800,,382,4.0394736842105265
