8416225,5,B0044NCNMC,"A gentle bittersweet story about and insightful little girl struggling with her sisters transition to adolescence and a boy with an unusual problem. The cinematography is lush and the scenes of Argentine farm life are gritty and beautiful. (Spoiler alert)  If you are expecting a story about a transgendered girl (all the rage these days) as in ""Tomboy"" be ready for something a bit more nuanced and sophisticated. Also be aware that the several scenes of farm life include the slaughtering of animals and are unflinchingly graphic. If this bothers you you might want to give it a miss.",1409788800,2,586,4.91919191919192

8416227,5,B0044NCNMC,"La boyita deals with a sensitive subject with noblesse oblige. Jorgelina, a nine year old girl who is just as annoying to her older sister as my sister was to me at times, also encapsulates the contradictions of life that enable her to be at the same time wonderfully caring and understanding when she discovers that a boy who works for her father has a serious and difficult to live with secret. This film, which employed a largely non professional cast, with a tiny crew, on an even smaller budget, manages to pull off what many big budget Hollywood productions have tried and failed. It has taken a painful and socially difficult issue and presented it in a believable and non judgemental way, and without histrionics or excess of drum-banging. Naturally and appropriately acted by all. I would though, have been interested to see more made of the Jewish element; Jorgelina's Judaism is only mentioned once.",1389312000,4,910,4.839743589743589
8416228,4,B0044NCNMC,"This is one of those are films that does not come along very often, It tells the story of Jorgelina played with a maturity that belies her tender years by Guadeloupe Alonso.  She likes playing with her older sister, but said sister has just reached puberty and no longer wants to be associated with little sister as she doesn't even wear a bra. It is set in 1986 and the boyita is the caravan Jorgelina uses as an escape.

So summer holidays come around and instead of going with her sister and mother to the coast, she goes with her doctor father to their farm in the country. This is managed by a family she has known all her life and they have a son Mario (Nicolas Treise) who has dropped out of school and now works on the farm. He has also moved out of the farm house to live in the barn, where he wiles away the time carving animals out of wood and never being seen undressed.

Whilst preparing his horse for the yearly race meeting, Jorgelina realises that he too is bleeding the same way her sister has started to, and so sets about helping him with the aid of medical books and then the professional touch of her father. What happens after will have a profound effect on all those concerned.

This is beautifully acted, directed and produced; I have to say that as the exec producer is Pedro Almodovar. There are some brilliant touches that show the differences between country and town living in Argentina; I especially liked the pigs head cheese. There are also scenes of animal butchery that some may find off putting. I just felt this was a brilliant, compelling and very moving film, and considering the youth and inexperience of some of the actors, there is not a bad performance through out. If you liked `XXY' or `Tomboy' then chances are this will be one you will want to see - strongly recommended, in Spanish with good sub titles and at just over an hour and a half it doesn't out stays its welcome.",1339718400,6,1919,4.4124293785310735
