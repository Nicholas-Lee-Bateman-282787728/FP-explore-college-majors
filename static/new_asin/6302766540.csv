509653,1,6302766540,"""The Last Dinosaur"", is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and this of course includes films such as ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" and some of the films produced by Roger Corman.
I picked this loser up in an Oakland Salvation Army and the copy I had was put out by Alpha Video Distributors, Inc., the initials for which should also stand for ""Another Video Disaster"".  My copy was issued on VHS in the EP mode.  There is a disclaimer on the cassette which states ""Please Adjust Tracking Control For Best Picture Quality"".  Translated properly, this is a fair warning to ""Please Pray For ANY picture"".  The tape would only ""track"" in one of two extreme positions on my player.  Aside from this, Boone's acting is atrocious and Van Ark's is merely sliding by on a ""pass"" basis.  Wilt Chamberlain was obviously under contract never to utter a word.  I think he was working for scale or something.  Unless the VHS version of the film was drastically cut from the original source, the transitions are abrupt and disjointed throughout.  The only good thing about this stinker are some (but not all) of the special effects.  Yes, the dinosaurs look like they might have Japanese film crew members inside, but they at least move smoothly!  I thought I saw Wilt pushing one from behind.  What I reall would like to know is what the hell happened to Wilt toward the end?  He seems to have just disappeared completely.  I wonder if this happened while I dozed off or something, because it was impossible to stay fully awake throughout.  Next time, I am going to have some espresso.
Anyway, if you are into video ""torture"", this is a film for you.  Don't expect much more than a lot of yelling from Boone.  He was great in the fifties as ""Paladdin"", but then his career took a BIG nose-dive and this film is an example of his final years in the field.
Good credits to the Japanese extras in caveman suits and the Yoko Ono ""look-alike"" as the counterpart to Joan Van Ark.  Frankly, I think that Joan must have either been married to the director or was sleeping with Boone, which might be true.  How else could she have been given that part?  Who the heck is she, anyway?
Heck, I got my one dollar's worth!  Just think how much tape they saved by producing this on EP speed.  They had enough left over for at least ten more ""dino the dinosaur"" flicks, maybe fifteen!

509654,2,6302766540,"The movie is a blast--never saw the end as a kid--but I'm disappointed that it's in EP mode on VHS which lowers the video and audio quality.  I purchased it throught Amazon.com, and I think that this fact (extended play mode), should have been revealed.  At times the clicking, popping, and hissing of the soundtrack made it sound like the movie was made 45 years earlier.",989280000,7,372,4.621212121212121
509655,4,6302766540,"What a great flick! Fun fun fun. I think the title song (sounding a bit James Bondish) really sums up the whole point of the movie, which is the comparison of ""The Last Great White Hunter"" and ""The Last Great Beast"". However, the film also focuses on man's obsession with ""Killing That Which We Do Not Understand"" because it makes us feel superior. As for the FX, hey it's no Speilberg movie, but I remember when I was a youngin' and saw this flick for the first time and thought the special effects were awesome. Richard Boone definetly gives an over the top performance as the hunter who is dead set on killing this T-Rex. Wilt Chamberlin as the African Scout/hunter who acts as Boone's right arm is a real treat - he's one tall dude! Also, Joan Van Ark playing a reporter, who gets to go on the Polar Borer trip to document it, does wonderful in her sympathetic, fall-in-love with the crazed hunter, get me out of this god forsaken dinoland role. All in all a great flick with a great storyline. Grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy 70's camp at it's best.  -Sure wish someone like Wolfgang Peterson would remake this movie and really push the message it has home-",985132800,2,1163,4.434579439252336

Richard Boone is particularly good as the cantankerous Maston, a rich hunter who is on the trail of the last tyrannosaurus on  Earth.  His hell-bent determination to kill this creature forms the very  center of the film's story and brings a welcome depth to what could have  been a brainless time waster.  The other characters are thankfully more  than just dumb dino bait.  The spfx are very well done for the time(Of  course, digital technology has caused leaps in effects work but, a film  must be evaluated in the context of when it was made!).

However, to see the once distinguished star of ""Have Gun Will Travel"" fall to his career low in this awful movie, too old to be ranting around the wilds and carrying significant weight around his middle, is just too much for me.  Bad script, acting, and directing, with guys in dinosaur suites chasing everyone, and of course the ape-like cave men (and women) add to the overall silliness of a rollicking ""$20"" budget, dinosaur flick putting this one over the hill and a candidate for the ""worst ever"" list of ""B"" movies.

509751,1,6302766540,"This is a movie from 1977 that stars Richard Boone who is probably best known for playing Palladin on the 1960s TV western show Have Gun-Will Travel. Boones character in The Last Dinosaur is a billionaire who enjoys hunting big game. He has built a boring machine, (thats boring as in digging a hole) large enough to hold a group of humans, that he plans to use to cut into the earth to a cavity where prehistoric life still lives including a tyrannosaur. He acts like he plans to study the rex but everyone in the audience (and no one in the film) knows he really plans to hunt it and kill it. He and his team arrive in the prehistoric underground with Joan Van Arks character in tow. They see Pteranodons and an enormous Uintatherium-like creature (that the expert calls a ceratopsian) and eventually the T. rex. We also see the T. rex battle and kill a Triceratops (that must be the ceratopsian he meant.) First off, I will say that Have Gun-Will Travel was a respected 1960s TV show in its day. I was a little young then to remember it now but I know my dad really enjoyed it. So, I have to ask, what happened to Boones acting abilities in the 1970s when he made this movie? And Joan Van Ark and the others in this film aren't much better. Wow, is this ever a bad movie! Yes, thats my opinion but I challenge any of you to sit and watch this entire movie , like I had to do, and tell me Im mistaken.
The story is so unoriginal and the acting is just sad. The dinosaurs are of the man-in-a-suit variety. The T. rex even makes the same sound that Godzilla does in all of his films. Like the dinosaur suits, the miniature models (like the bore machine, for instance) are obviously made in Japan. There are even several Japanese actors in the film and all of the cavepeople that our intrepid team meet in prehistoric land are also Japanese. So, this was obviously a Japanese collaborative effort, even though the movie was done by Rankin/Bass, probably best known for Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and other holiday animated cartoons. It says on the DVD that this is the complete original theatrical version. I have been told that on the Japanese version of this DVD, a further half an hour of footage is included. Im not complaining that I only have the American version however as it is merciful of this version to have cut out a half an hour of this film. Thank you. (It is a little bad that this DVD includes nothing extra though: no deleted scenes, no directors commentary, no special features.)",1435795200,,2501,4.427331887201736

509755,5,6302766540,"Just finished watching ""The Last Dinosaur"" released by Warner Brothers as part of their Archive Collection.
Now I can remember when ""The Last  Dinosaur"" first aired on television back in 1977 when we still had the old console black and white television.  [We didn't get color television and cable until 1980 when we lived at Camp Lejeune, which is another story in itself.]
If memory serves me correctly, ""The Last Dinosaur"" was supposed to have been distributed to theaters for a nationwide release, but it never did.  Which is a pity, because this Rankin/Bass production holds up rather well over the passage of time.
Multi-Billionare Martin Thrust is bored with life.  A big game hunter who is constantly at odds with environmental groups over his promotion and deep love of hunting.
In fact, his private 747 is decked out as a game trophy/hunting lodge.  The opening montage of music, ""The Last Dinosuar"" sung by Nancy Wilson, has some a really naughty photo in it saying that someone ""isn't great at 699.""  How that got past the censors of the time, I'll never know.
""The Last Dinosaur"" opens with with Thrust hurrying to a press conference to announce the unexpected discovery by his employees of Thrust Industries; who were searching for oil in the Artic, of a lost tropical world where dinosaurs roam inside a dormant polar volcano and where a Tyrannosaurus Rex still roams and managed to kill off four of the five team members in submerbsible who went ashore to explore.
Thrust announces that he is leading an expedition to study this lost world with great fanfare.  And soon he and his team are being launched underwater inside the submersible to this lost world that also contains primitive humans as well.
Pity that that T-Rex only wants to eat, not be studied.  It quickly devours one member of Thrust's team and what should turn out to be a simply quest for survival and get the hell out of there, turns Thrust into a single-minded psychotic who is now living only to kill the T-Rex - which makes this movie gripping to watch.
""The Last Dinosaur"" is a cult classic and is the top 100 of my Schlock Theater Movie List.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
FIVE STARS!",1422144000,2,2165,4.754666666666667
509756,4,6302766540,"This Warner Archive DVD is yet another fine purchase if you are a collector of fantasy/horror/adventure/sf movies (as I am), and this oldie from the golden year 1977 remains a perfect comedy/adventure thriller that sends Richard Boone out on a B-movie safari to the land of the unknown prehistoric critters that only the most hardened cinematic skeptic would find unwatchable. In fact, the script is actually pretty entertaining until the picture falls apart after the second half of the film's overly long running time, but even then Richard Boone still gets in quite a few hysterical one-liners. There is even a low-budget dinosaur fight that is as entertaining as all get out, and far more enjoyable to watch than the modern CGI atrocities which try to make things look ""real"" (which is basically a way of insulting audiences on a higher and more disturbing level, which plays with a viewer's psychology by making appear real what the audience understands to be NOT real, and then having them pay for a chance to see it become REAL...or something). To me, these older movies are far more honest than the psychologically confused pictures of today (which house audiences who no longer have any idea as to what they really want). And to be fair to the filmmakers here, these dinosaurs (though admittedly rubber) actually look pretty damn cool to me. It's really too bad that the American and Japanese film companies cannot work together more often to do more of these lower budget adventure film offerings for television movie packages because this one was certainly satisfying enough. My main complaint is that the DVD did not include the alternate versions of this movie, as with the digital formatting that we have now so many more hours of bonus content can be included. The version you are watching here is the original theatrical run of the film, NOT the one originally shown on television in the West. There is, therefore, at least thirty some odd minutes of additional footage that is missing (but is included in the Japanese prints). William Overgard was a cartoonist with a decidedly humorous aesthetic of life (he worked on ""ThunderCats""), and his screenplay is what holds this messy but wondrous B-movie glue together. Watch it, laugh, listen, and enjoy. Now this is what fun movies about outlandish subjects should be, and what inventive story collaborations are all about. B+",1421280000,8,2390,4.962593516209476

Richard Boone the former school teacher in St. Augustine Florida was never a big movie star. Although he did a pretty good Clint Easwood like performance in Madrone. But he was best as the villan. Especially in movies with John Wayne like Wayne's last movie, The Shootest. I thought his performance in A THUNDER OF DRUMS as an old worn out formerly disgrace Calvary Captain at a God forsaken post undermanned & under seige in the middle of Native American attacks was his greatest performance. Heading up a cast of George hamilton, Richard Chamberlain to attract the ladies & another legendary character actor Arthur O'connel as his top NCO all you needed was a young actor working his way up. That turned out to be Charles Bronson. I'll rate that one 41/2 stars. As for The Last Dinosaur 31/2 stars.

There's some funny moments, moments of romance that come out of nowhere, and a 'madman' of a hunter who won't rest until he's killed himself a T-rex!!

We talked about it at work for a week afterward (gotta keep in mind, Jaws came out about 6-months earlier, and it headlined at cinemas for over 100-weeks, back then, and Star Wars hadn't been heard of yet). We were amazed that Richard Boone would do a 'creature feature' like this, it really wasn't his style overall. His acting is the powerhouse that sells this show. I went back and watched it a week ago, yes, the CGI wasn't CGI back then, it was rubber suits and Ray Harryhausen's claymation. The actors actually had to get dirty, the costumes are of the era, but the story is still complex, from a time when you actually had complex themes still in movies that the actors had to sell ALL of to make a good show. It is almost two movies in one, it is 'Armageddon' (getting to the dinoland with the Polar Explorer) and Jurrassic Park (OMG the dinos are going to kill us), put together. Yes, it would look great in today's films with CGI 'real life' dinosaurs, a $200-million budget, real-location filming, maybe some real dino-cloning to boot. Since none of that has, or is going to happen, I guess you'll have to watch this EXCELLENT old movie that set the actual genre for 'Jurassic Films' way before it's time, if you want to see a good story with 'at the time', best-resources available. Oh, and FYI, it was NOT a 'B-Movie' when it came out.

509875,5,6302766540,"This movie is great and all the wiseasses who compare it to Corman & Ed Wood are WRONG (& cynically negative to boot.) If one studies what the movie DOES do, it's very ambitious. As an excellent dino movie should do, ""Last Dinosaur"" streamlines a simple plot geared to build & max out the dinosaur action & conveys the characters' sense of threat & menace of their great size; the camera angles often show characters in the same shot as the dinosaur. Because my favorite technique was used, suitmation (i.e man-in-suit) & slowed camera speed & giant physical props, the huge PHYSICAL presence is palpable- (unlike other techniques (CGI & claymation) where the lightning or lack of concreteness is often distractingly unconvincing.) The editing expresses these ideas wonderfully (& is in fact the opposite of laughable: it's masterful). If you analyze how Bunta climbs a tree, sees a TRex eyetoeye, jumps down & sees its head at the treetops, spears it, ducks its gigantic tail- the mixing of miniature sets & real locations is done as well as possible. Critics have clearly never considered the logistics of portraying this stuff. After a certain point, the expense & effort of making props more realistic adds zero to the storytelling.
  Let me tell you why Spielberg movies stink: he does flipbooks of moneyshots. Once you memorize them, you're never transported into the location again because only precise action is manufactured. Ditto Harryhausen movies, (which btw have MUCH cornier acting,)& skittish unconvincing motion. Despite the painstaking work, they also remind the viewer ""THIS NEVER HAPPENED.""  Sorry, but what classic Tsuburaya/Honda Godzilla movies did RIGHT is used fewer cameras, slower scene pacing, & more generalized action so the viewer EXTRAPOLATES a reality beyond the frame of film. So if you like being sucked into the dream of humans interacting with huge prehistoric reptiles in a remote, untamed locale, this movie body slams most of its peers.
  Final word on budget & deadlines: compare
the quality of a little rushed-out flick called Cloverfield to the bloated mess of P. Jackson's Kong.",1374796800,4,2121,5.118497109826589

Growing up in Europe, where this film actually got a theatrical release, I remember seeing this film in the theater.  In the eyes of a little boy, back then, this was the greatest movie ever.  All the plot inconsistencies, rubber suits, odd casting, weak performances, etc. went unnoticed.  It was simply a fantastic adventure.  Seeing it today makes me laugh, and I take it for what it is, but since I also remember what it once was I realize that maybe our kids will enjoy this movie too.
For those of you who do like it you may also want to check out the B movie productions of At Earths Core (1976) and The Land that Time Forgot (1975,) because The Last Dinosaur is very much a combined plot of those two earlier movies.

509905,5,6302766540,"First off know that this movie was a late 1970's Japanese and American co-production (Tsuburaya of Ultraman fame & Rankin/Bass of classic stop-motion Rudolph and other holiday movies fame).  For the viewer accustomed to and requiring more recent and realistic CGI and animatronic dinosaur fare you'll likely find this movie gravely disappointing.  But your expectations, not the movie itself, would bring you your disappointment!  This is one fun movie ride that you will hate to see come to an end.  It is endearing, especially to those of us who watched it when we were children or young teens at the time.  Like many others this movie holds a very special, warm place in my heart.  I grew up as a Godzilla and dinosaur fan (all usually played by men in suits or by puppets).  For its time (1977 I think) this was very good indeed in that the dino suits were not overly stylized but they were very functional and in the case of the T-Rex, unique.  The T-Rex here was able to display a lot of emotion and canniness in its actions.  It was the hunter as well as the hunted.  The other hunter was played by (at that time) an old dinosaur himself by the name of Masten Thrust (ugh! only a pulp writer would come up with a name like that), played by Richard Boone, a big game hunter and...oil tycoon if I remember it right.  Masten finances a mission into the interior of the earth to a prehistoric pocket that is ruled by the fearsome T-Rex.  With a ridiculously long and limber tail this dynamic dino becomes the expedition's worst nightmare and Masten's personal Moby Dick.  There are some great scenes in this movie like when we are treated to a scientist's POV as he looks up to see the T-Rex stepping on him!  Or when the group manages to tie vines around a huge boulder and the T-Rex's tail and we get to see the T-Rex careening down a mountain slope, crushing through the timber, as it follows the rolling boulder.  Or when the boulder, hurled at the T-Rex by improvised catapult, creases the T-Rex's puppet head in surreal slow motion.  There are many more great moments like these.  Older viewers will recognize some of the expedition's crew, and especially the would-be love interest of several of the crew members, Joan Van Ark as reporter Francesca Banks.

While the story isn't anything spectacular it does try to say a few things about ecology and about beliefs.  The title of ""the last dinosaur"" certainly can refer to the T-Rex but it is actually applicable to Masten Thrust's Ahabian self, the person who is so self-possessed and obsessed, that they are willing to go to any length and even die for their opposition of that which they should simply allow to be.  At once the film pays homage to Masten's character, suggesting that this type of man is a dying breed, even as it criticizes the breed in its death throes.

This movie will always be a part of me, a part of the child in me.  I'm so happy to be able to have this on DVD.  Now if Warner would only put out ""The Ivory Ape"" maybe my childhood would be complete.",1344988800,2,3035,4.508226691042047
509906,1,6302766540,"Where is Ray Harryhausen when we really need him?

This movie stinks. I gave it one star because you have to give it something. I would prefer to give it 1/2 a star. A small expedition sponsored by a wealthy adventurer with a mean streak (Richard Boone) takes a helicopter down inside a volcano in search of a dinosaur. If this plot reminds you of Universal's THE LAND UNKNOWN from 1958, so will the T-Rex. This film is in color instead of LAND UNKNOWN's B&W, but the T-Rex costume is just as silly looking as Land unknown's T-Rex. It's a shame that this movie isn't as good as THE LAND UNKNOWN. You will laugh your butt off. There is a fight between the Rex and an equally flimsy looking Triceratops and it looks like a fight between two drunks in dinosaur costumes at a Halloween party. They teeter and totter and fall all over each other and look as though the rubbery skin is about to rupture.

This is the worst performance I have ever seen from Mr. Boone (TV's Palladin in Have Gun-Will Travel). Seriously, I wonder if he was ill. Never a handsome man, he overacts and is overweight and out of shape in this movie.

His love interest is Joan Van Ark, easily young enough to be Boone's daughter. Gee Whiz, she sure landed a lot of crappy roles before Knott's Landing!

I recognize the other actor with the gap-tooth smile as the same actor who played Dom De Luise's lazy brother-in-law on Dom's show LOTSA LUCK. I can't remember this actor's name and, in fact, I don't want to remember it. There are a few other actors who serve as dinosaur food.

It's all photographed and clumsily directed around some mud-hole in CA (I guess).

Somehow or other, they got Nancy Wilson (Yes! That Nancy Wilson!) to sing the title song. Can you believe that someone actually wrote a song called ""The Last Dinosaur""? I don't remember who wrote it except that it wasn't Steve Sondheim or Burt Bacharach.

Do yourself a favor. Get JURASSIC PARK - THE LOST WORLD, eons better tha this  or get THE LAND UNKNOWN included in Universals Sc-Fi Classics set.

509908,4,6302766540,"A Japanese-American co-production involving Richard Boone out to hunt and kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex in a recently discovered lost world beyond the arctic. It features mostly American actors although there's the odd Japanese one (mostly playing the cavemen for some reason) with special effects, dinosaur costumes and miniature work done by the Japanese company Tsuburaya Productions (famous for its work on the Ultraman series). The Trannosaurus costume in particular was a refurbished suit from Tsuburaya's earlier Dinosaur War Izenborg.

Masten Thrust (Boone) is an over the hill big game hunter and the world's richest man. He thinks he's seen and done it all and is bored with life. But then new reaches him that a manned ""polar borer"" expedition in the arctic drilling for oil has discovered a lush and fertile lost world. The usual stuff. Getting it into his head that a dinosaur would make a perfect hunting trophy, Thrust puts together an expedition led by himself to take a second polar borer to explore the lost world.

Accompanying him are geologist Chuck Wade, the sole survivor of the last polar borer group; Francesca ""Frankie"" Banks, a renowned photographer; Bunta, a Masai tracker; and Dr. Kawamoto, a Japanese scientist. Things go well enough at first in the lost land, but Thrust's first attempt to kill the titular Tyrannosaur fails miserably and the thing kills Dr. Kawamoto and absconds with the polar borer, leaving the remaining expedition members stranded.

The group has to contend with the usual tribes of savage cavemen as they struggle for survival with seemingly no hope of escape, constantly dogged by the Tyrannosaur, whom Thrust becomes increasingly more and more obsessed with killing, more than even escaping back to civilization. The others slowly begin realizing Thrust really is ""the last dinosaur"" - the last of a dying breed of old world hunter-adventurers. And he isn't leaving without his final and greatest trophy.

A junky and clunky and altogether strange little movie with a haunting soundtrack, The Last Dinosaur is not without its charms. The cast is mostly okay, with Boone in particular coming off as somehow likable despite his character's curmudgeonly hostile behavior. Only Steven Keats as Chuck stands out as being a black hole of anti-personality, boredly reciting his lines as though he's half asleep, even when his character is supposed to be mad. The real attractions though are of course Tsuburaya Productions' dinosaur costumes, which are of course rubbery, goofy and altogether charming in that 1970's Japanese sci-fi kind of way. All in all, The Last Dinosaur is a great bad movie and I highly recommend it for fellow schlock lovers.",1328832000,,2693,5.155606407322654
509909,4,6302766540,"""The Last Dinosaur"" is without a doubt one of my favorite films from growing up in the 70's. For years, fans wanted this film to come out on dvd since the Japanese import version was running $50 to $60. This release is the uncut version just like the Japanese import. The transfer is nice (looks great upconverted to 1080p via HDMI) and is anamorphic widescreen. This is the film that really made me like Richard Boone (R.I.P.). He was awesome in this film and when he did the voice for Smog in ""The Hobbit"". And who doesn't love Joan Van Ark? This film and ""The Land That Time Forgot"" ruled back then with the exception of the Gojira and Gamera franchises of course; even though they are monsters not dinosaurs. ""Dinosaurus"" and ""One Million Years B.C."" are classics too. The big megahit came when ""Quest For Fire"" was released in 1981 showcasing primitive humans; Rae Dawn Chong was incredible in the film. ""The Last Dinosaur"" is a fun and exciting way to spend a couple of hours on the weekend for any age.

As for the rest, Richard Boone could yell like nobody's business and Joan Van Ark didn't know when to shut up.  (Although I did like the performance of the purse snatching cavewoman.)  Otherwise, it's a half-baked idea that's been baked better before, and since!  My biggest problem with it was the sloppy way they dealt with the time issues.  One scene abruptly led to another, 4 months later, but the only way I knew that was because they said it was four months later.  I thought I missed something, that they cut something out (although on that score, I would have thanked them!).  And before you know it, suddenly it's Moby Dick and Boone has to bag that big beast!

509924,4,6302766540,"I first saw this about 2 decades ago, back on TBS when they use to show movies on Saturday morning. I vividly remember there was a dinosaur movie marathon on that morning and this was one of them. Originally part of CBS's attempt at making theatrical films, this ended up going to TV instead. The film is a Japanese/American co-production between Rankin/Bass (popular for their Christmas specials, the movies The Hobbit and The Last Unicorn, and the 80s cartoon series Thundercats) and Tsuburaya Productions, founded by Godzilla FX legend Eiji Tsuburaya and creators of the mega-popular Ultraman TV series. The story revolves around big game hunter Mastin Thrust who uses a boring machine to travel inside a giant dormant volcano to hunt the ultimate prize, a giant Tyrannosaur. Under the false pretense of scientific research he brings along a Japanese scientist/and friend, a reporter, his trusty African guide, and the sole survivor of the previous expedition. When his friend is killed Mastin's true intentions become apparent and now he will stop at nothing to put the monster's head on his wall. Too bad he is without weapons and constantly hounded by a tribe of cavemen (all interestingly portrayed by Japanese actors). The film features several creatures (most played Japan style by actors in monster costumes) including a Uintatherium (mistakenly referred to as a Ceratopsian), a Pteranadon, a giant turtle, and (in the films best scene) a Triceratops who breaks out from beneath the earth (don't ask) to do battle with the titular monster. On that note the title has double meaning referring to the Rex and Mastin, both the last of their kind. Sure the movie is kinda cheesy, the FX wildly uneven, and the dialogue laughable at times but considering when and where it was made much can be forgiven. Maybe its part nostalgia and my love of Japanese monster movies that make me think of this film so fondly, but it has and always will be one of my childhood favorites. On an interesting note the T-rex costume would also appear as lead villain Emperor Tyrannus in the short lived TV series Attack of the Super Monsters. If your a fan of Japanese movie/TV monsters or cheesy 70s cinema, I highly recommend this. Awesome there's a good English DVD copy after all these years, especially since the only other official release is Toho's super expensive Japanese DVD.",1312070400,16,2370,4.942355889724311

509928,1,6302766540,"I was over at a friend's house and he insisted I watch this. He had been talking about it for quite a while and I decided that, if he had enjoyed it so much, there had to be something to it, so I watched it. The second I saw Joan Van Ark's credit come up, I knew what I was in for. For the uninitiated, Joan Van Ark was an actress that appeared in just about every made for TV movie done in the 70's, and if you're familiar with the ABC Movie Of The Week, you know what I was put through when my friend hit the ""Play"" button.

I'm willing to forgive a lot of things when I watch a movie - bad acting, bad direction, cheap FX, whatever. I did have some hope, however, since Richard Boone stars in this mess, and I like Richard Boone. He knew he was in a dog, however, so he went completely over the top when it came to acting in this - rolling his eyes, shaking his fist, taking overly dramatic pauses between words, etc. Joan Van Ark was Joan Van Ark, playing the stereotypical liberated woman of the 70's who is forced to deal with Boone's type A macho man, and to balance Boone out, a sensitive scientist played by Steven Keats, another 70's TV movie icon.

Boone plays Masten Thrust, an oil company owner who is also a big game hunter. He's rich beyond the dreams of avarice and bored silly, having done everything (if you listen carefully to the lyrics of the theme song, they tell you all about him). In a clever nod to the title, Thrust himself is actually the last dinosaur, since his thinking is so old-fashioned. He accompanies Van Ark and Keats and a couple others on a trip to a magical land in the antarctic via a manned drill his company created called a ""Polar Borer."" This machine must operate on the same priciple as a clown car, since it looks to be about the size of a Ford Pinto yet holds five people and several tons of equipment comfortably and still offers enough room to move around freely.

It seems Keats and another crew used the polar borer and discovered a place in the antarctic that is stuck in prehistory - when they landed, the crew was killed by a T-Rex and Keats was the only one to escape. Since he's the only one who knows how to get back there, he accompanies Thrust, Banks (Van Ark) and a few other people back to the poorly constructed set that time forgot. Once there, they meet up with cavemen (and women), the T-Rex, a Triceratops, and a few other things. Thrust sees the T-Rex as the ultimate trophy and goes after it with a single mindedness bordering on lust while the rest of the crew (except Van Ark and Keats) wind up getting eaten or stomped on. The best part is when Thrust finally fires his handmade catapult at the T-Rex and hits it. We see the head cave in like foam rubber (which it is) and then bounce right back into shape while the guy in the dinosaur suit gets a little wobbly-kneed.

There are a TON of other things I could mention (like Thrust having a working fireplace in his private jet), but writing about this is making me angry for tossing off 90 minutes of my life on this movie. If you're interested in this junk, jump on it now - my friend paid $35 for his copy.",1217376000,4,3131,4.222036727879799

Sure adults now may be uninspired by a low budget movie from 1977, but as a kid, to find yourself in a land where dinosaurs still walk the earth, it was fascinating. I loved the characters of Frankie, Chuck and yes, even Maston. I had always hoped for a sequel where Frankie and Chuck would return for Maston with a new crew. But it never happened. Sadly, Richard Boone (Maston) and Steven Keats (Chuck Wade) are no longer with us. I do hope one day that the powers that be, remake this movie.",1213315200,,757,4.25
509930,2,6302766540,"He's big, mean, vicious, and ugly - no, not the dinosaur; I'm talking about Richard Boone's character in this cheesy yet weirdly interesting little film from 1977 (I say film, even though it ended up premiering on television rather than making the rounds of cinemas).  I can't help but wonder if her role in The Last Dinosaur actually helped secure Joan Van Ark the part of Valene Ewing.  Maybe some big wigs at Lorimar were lounging around one night, happened to catch some of this film, and jumped up exclaiming ""That's Valene Ewing right there"" once they saw how incredibly annoying and weepy Joan Van Ark was in the role of Frankie Banks.  The only difference is that here she falls for a man's man rather than a little girly man like Gary Ewing.

So here's the deal.  Masten Thrust (Richard Boone), who is basically the richest man in the world, announces - in the surliest way possible - that some of his men drilling for oil underneath the Arctic ice cap broke through into a ""lost world"" straight out of the Cretaceous Era - complete with dinosaurs, including a Tyrannosaurus Rex, according to lone survivor Chuck Wade (Steven Keats).  Having devoted his life to hunting and killing anything that moves - the closer to extinction, the better - Thrust declares that he will be leading an expedition to find this T. Rex.  Accompanying him will be his friend Dr. Kawamoto (Tetsu Nakamura), Chuck Wade, his favorite hunting guide Bunta (Luther Rackley), and someone from the press pool.  That last someone turns out to be photographer Frankie Banks (Van Ark).  Being the womanizing sexist that he is, Thrust vetoes that idea - until, of course, Banks uses her charms to convince him otherwise.  One short Polar Borer ride later, the gang arrives and sets off in search of the king of dinosaurs.  They find much more than they bargained for, however, making a fairly quick transition from the hunters to the hunted.  Many shenanigans then ensue, accompanied by Thrust's constant grouching and Banks' incessant whining.  All the while, you'll be hoping that the dinosaur will hurry up and kill every last one of them.

You can't help but get a kick out of the special effects on display in this film, for most of them are borderline awful.  I daresay even Roger Corman would have laughed at such bad special effects as these.  The T. Rex is okay (albeit rather gooey) on head shots, but you can't help but laugh when he's shown peering down from above the treetops or as he walks around in all of his low-budget glory.  Now I know what you're wondering - are there any dinosaur fights?  I am happy to say that there is indeed one little melee between our T. Rex and a different species of dinosaur - that's basically the one and only highlight of the entire film.

The ending actually has a tiny bit of a philosophical tinge to it - OK, maybe that's stretching it a bit.  Even so, The Last Dinosaur does actually lend itself to at least a couple of literary allusions - and that is something you cannot say about the vast majority of films in this genre.

Even the puppet-based dinosaur effects of ""The Land That Time Forgot"" were better than what's on display here.  The technology was available, but the makers of this film chose not to use it.  That being said, this is one of the best cheesy films I've ever seen.  The acting rivals the special effects for being the most inept part of the film!  It's one of the few horrendously bad movies I can actually enjoy on its own, without the help of the MST3K crew (although I really wish they had done this one).  Now if it were only available on DVD in widescreen (I saw it broadcast widescreen once, so I know it exists in that form).",1117756800,,933,4.415204678362573

If this type of idiotic question intrigues you, you are well on your way to the drinking game of all drinking games.
This movie stars a fossilized Charles Bronson look-alike, (Richard Boone) that spurned us to create several rules that may lend a hand to your drinking pleasure.
For instance, drink every time......
1.  you hear the cheesy 70's music go...""da da da, da da da, da da da""
2.  you can see a seam in one of the dinosaurs/actors outfits.
3.  Boone moves to slap the annoying cave girl.
4.  you see the same rubber ptaradactyl going around on the same fan blown string.
5.  Boone looks like an ass or a drunk. (If this rule is applied, you may want to have either the ER or a spare stomach pump on standby).
6.  a dinosaur roars like an old 50's style Godzilla.
7.  Boonta(Wilt Chamberlain) tries not to laugh at Boone's atrocious attempts to act.
8.  Blondie (Joan Van Ark) whines.
If you make it through this tri-cathlon of drinking, this movie will be as dear to your heart as it is to mine and Festus'.

509934,3,6302766540,"The last dinosaur is a film about a rich hunter and business tycoon (RICHARD BOONE) who learns of a living T-rex. He sets out to ""study it"" with a team comprised of a journalist (JOAN VAN ARK), a palentologist, Tribal tracker, and the pilot of a Polar Borer craft to take them under the polar ice to a hidden valley heated by a polar volcano. The team becomes stranded and the tycoon's real intentions become aparent. He plans to hunt and kill the T-rex as the ultimate hunter's prize...no matter what the cost! The 70's filming is apparent as the dinosaurs are Ok for the time period by truely cheesey for today's era of CGI. Acting and plot are good...at times. I would love to see this film remade with the concept and production methods updated.  As for the original, if you are a dino movie fan, it's a must see at least once.",1062806400,21,831,4.396103896103896

He was very suprised when I gave it to him.  I watched some of the movie with him and it's so old that I couldn't bare to watch it.  I can't stand bad viewing in movies.  It was blury and so fake, but my dad enjoyed it.  So, if your AN ADULT and appreciate OLD MOVIES I suppose you would like this movie.

509936,3,6302766540,"I thoroughly enjoy watching this type of bad cinema, so when I saw this stinker (re-released during the ""Jurassic Park"" era), I knew I had to order it for my collection.  When my copy finally arrived, I rushed it to the VCR and insisted that my wife watch it with me.  My favorite scene is when the eminent Dr. Yamamoto turns around to find that a 5 ton dinosaur has snuck up on him!  That scene could have been believable if the dino had surprised Richard Boone, who was convincingly incoherent throughout the film.
My wife's unforgettable scene came near the end, when the U.S. Navy was attempting to retrieve the Polar Borer and crew. ""That's Uncle Don!"", she screamed in horror.  Apparently, while working in Japan, her uncle was offered a bit part in the movie.  His fee... third billing on the credits!

509937,1,6302766540,"I am a person who loves old, crappy movies, such as Plan 9 from Outer Space, First Spaceship on Venus, the Creature from the Haunted Sea, etc. I can confidently say that this is the single worst movie I have ever seen (replacing the former winner, FSoV). The lead (Boone) is quite honestly the ugliest person I have ever seen. The plot was about as believable as George Bush having a sex change. After being seduced by a questionably attractive woman (who claims to be a feminist), the main character, Thrust, drills a phalus-shaped drill through the artic icecap (despite the lack of ground underneath the ice), and find a ""beautiful"" tropical paradise, replete with ugly ""dinosaurs"" (men in crappy suits, one even still bearing the original horse tail), and ""pterodactyls"" that I like to call Kiteodactyl...they don't flap their wings, and you can almost see the wires they hang from. I don't remember much of the plot from there on, because there wasn't much of one, but the antics of trying to catch the tyrannosaur were somewhat amusing.
And please, don't get me started on the title song.
This is the only movie I've ever regretted buying. I only gave it 1 star because there is no selection for 0 stars.",1036195200,,1210,4.712264150943396
509938,2,6302766540,"Some reviews of this film say that it is the BEST KAIJU EIGA film ever. Those people are on DRUGS!!! Richard Boone looks and sounds drunk through the whole movie. To make matters worse we are supposed to believe that women find him irresistible even though he looks like a rotten log in a safari hat!!! Joan Van Ark is so irritating and whiney that you'll want one of the dinosaurs to eat her! And let's talk about the other guy--some young scientist guy who must have attended the William Shatner school of over-acting and FLUNKED! ...However it is also very funny in some parts. My favorite is when the title dino is bashed in the head with a Flintstone styled catapult, and we get to see the boulder litterally dent and bounce off of the creature's head like a Nerf ball.

It's just a fun to watch movie, if you can ignore the couple minutes of silliness near the beginning.  And the fact that such a
great big game hunter can miss a shot at a dinosaur the size of a barn, and then have his gun jam like an amateur.  But it really is
a good movie to sit and watch on a rainy or snowy day inside.  Recommend.",1512432000,,461,4.088888888888889
