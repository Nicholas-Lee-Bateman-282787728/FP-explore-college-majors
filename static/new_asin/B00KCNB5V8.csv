8657611,1,B00KCNB5V8,"This movie was slow...it began slow...it stayed slow and it ended slow.

It was incredibly hard to get through because it was so slow. I kept finding my mind wandering but I refused to fast forward the movie like I usually do to movies of this caliber. The shots were too long, the angles rough and the 'jump factor' was too mild to be considered 'scary'.

All in all it was a horrible movie that I would never recommend to anyone - unless of course you have a TON of time to waste and absolutely nothing else to do.",1478304000,,516,4.202020202020202
8657612,1,B00KCNB5V8,"I thought it was prime and in English. It said prime, but when I clicked on it to watch it, no prime shows up. It was a very slow and a ridiculous story line. Looks like a homemade movie. We didn't even finish watching it! The picture on the movie cover was the best part of the dumb movie.",1465603200,,290,3.9322033898305087
8657613,1,B00KCNB5V8,Terrible.  Boring! Visual and sound quality was very poor.  I did even care to watch what the end would be.  I stopped watching half way through.  Waste of time.,1459209600,,161,4.448275862068965
8657614,5,B00KCNB5V8,Verygood,1459209600,,8,8.0
8657615,2,B00KCNB5V8,"The ending had a nice twist,but mostly it was boring & didn't make much sense at times.",1459123200,,87,4.176470588235294
8657616,2,B00KCNB5V8,Painfully slow.  Torture.  Finally in last 20 minutes something actually happened.,1458172800,,82,6.363636363636363
8657617,3,B00KCNB5V8,"Thought it was what it said , but surprised it was okay",1458172800,,55,3.6666666666666665
8657618,5,B00KCNB5V8,"Great movie what a freakin plot twist ending oh my God did not see that coming. Wanting a baby Yan with In Vitro fertilization is successfully impregnated. Later she moves to a new apartment  after a while things start getting weird she hears Ying, Ying her daughter talking to someone but upon investigation finds no one there when asked Ying, Ying tells her mom she was talking to her dad who said he wants her to go with him. Yan starts hearing voices and seeing ghosts, things become increasingly bizarre sending Yan on a search for the donor Ying, Ying's father and in the process discovers a dark and very deadly secret

With this gem you get a sweet slow burn mystery ghosts spooky events as the who's your daddy part plays out. There is no demonic possession or anything like that. The actors did an amazing job portraying their character with ease and perfection, the characters are great and very believable, subtitles are easy to read. Films like this are why I love Asian horror movies",1457654400,2,997,4.627118644067797
8657619,3,B00KCNB5V8,"Nothing like a good slow burn ghost story with English subtitles. Yan has a child in-vitro. Yann and her seven year old daughter ying-ying move into a new apartment with the help f her brother. Once she is settled in, strange things start to happen as Yan sees ghostly images in the mirror out of the corner of her eye. Her daughter claims she can see her father and talks to him. Yan is disturbed by this and goes on a quest to find the biological father.

The film is shot in Malaysia. All the signs are in English. You can pause on the father's information sheet and read it in English. From the situation you can pretty much know what they are saying without a translation. Words like ""bye"" and ""papa"" have worked their way into their  Cantonese language.  The film  moves on the slow side.",1444521600,3,794,4.380952380952381
