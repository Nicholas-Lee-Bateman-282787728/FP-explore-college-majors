4518630,1,B0050WLOSA,"Actually, the movie is great.  When I watched it the first time, it was in wide screen and being a retired Marine, I enjoyed it very much.  There should be a dvd/blu-ray disc out there with a wide screen version of this movie...Amazon does a very good job at selling good stuff.  This disc however, was a disappointment.

Thanks,
Bob Flores",1399766400,12,340,4.524590163934426

4518633,5,B0050WLOSA,"Like my title says, '30 Years of Waiting and Searching', I have been in love with Jeffrey Hunter 4/5ths of my life. When I was in San Francisco not so long ago, I thought of him, lol.  I even went to Carmel/Monteray, just because of the ending of this movie  I collect everything he's ever been in and now, FINALLY, In Love and War is finally released, my all time favorite. I only purchased it today, and looking forward to receiving it.

From reading other customers ratings, I understand it is NOT in CinemaScope, I will also have another problem, I will not be able to play it on my big screen because the DVD is Region 1, which is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO annoying, as i'm in Australia :-(

Alas, I will be happy to watch it on a smaller screen with All region DVD player, and a awful as it is that it's not in Cinemascope, I can live with that.",1395273600,2,841,4.2375
4518634,1,B0050WLOSA,"If you're going to put the original poster art on the DVD case, featuring the word, ""CinemaScope,"" you had better have a widescreen transfer. 20th Century-Fox's Cinema Archives vault of hard-to-find cult and library titles has released In Love and War, the 1958 WWII actioner from Fox, written by Edward Anhalt, directed by Philip Dunne, and starring Robert Wagner, Dana Wynter, Jeffrey Hunter, Hope Lange, Bradford Dillman, Sheree North, France Nuyen, and Mort Sahl. In Love and War was originally shot in 2.35 CinemaScope. Here, it's presented in a panned-and-scanned 4 x 3 transfer. Fox has been all over the map with these Cinema Archives releases in terms of correct screen ratios, with information on the web sketchy about which titles are botched. So, in an effort to help other fans like myself who want these movies presented correctly, and who don't want to waste their money on fatally compromised product...skip this release of In Love and War, because there's no excuse, Fox--NONE--for releasing a panned-and-scanned transfer of a widescreen movie in 2014.",1393459200,27,1069,5.184971098265896
4518635,1,B0050WLOSA,"Common Fox, you did it again... pan & scan = a cinemascope movie in 4:3 in the ages of 16:9 TV's.
Your classic movies could be sold much better when you do it correct. This movie would could looks great on DVD or much better on Blu-Ray.

But on this way (4:3)? No thanks.",1393113600,12,271,4.018518518518518
4518636,1,B0050WLOSA,"Once again, Fox Cinema Archives has ruined an excellent war movie filmed in CinemaScope by releasing it in the Pan & Scan horror. Shame on you! You ruin these great films. I'd rather not see them released at all. PLEASE - do not support these outrageous releases.",1391385600,25,263,4.617021276595745
4518637,4,B0050WLOSA,"The other reviewer must be referring to the upcoming US dvd by Fox Archives which is only in Pan/Scan - this 2012 release is in English, in stereo, and in widescreen/scope -2:35:1. It is also cheaper to buy from Amazon. es directly .",1391299200,14,233,4.441860465116279
4518638,1,B0050WLOSA,"CINEMASCOPE appears on the disc cover but PAN AND SCAN in the description.  Which is it?  Personally, I will only order if it is in widescreen.  My low rating is based on the assumption that Fox is up to its old tricks.  Would think they would have gotten the message by now.  Few collectors are interested in owning a disc that shows only a little more than half of the picture.",1390780800,5,379,4.28169014084507
4518639,5,B0050WLOSA,I have loved this movie FOREVER.  Just a typical military movie with action and romance.  Just always remember Robert Wagner and Jeffery Hunter in particular in the movie. Could watch it over and over.,1428537600,,201,4.882352941176471
4518640,1,B0050WLOSA,"I wanted to buy this dvd, but the 1.33:1 Aspect Ratio is a deal killer. This movie was widescreen when I saw it as a boy.",1426377600,,121,3.6923076923076925

4518642,3,B0050WLOSA,this is not amazons fault but this is a pan an scan version put out by the studio which sucks  the quality is good buy but should be put out by he studio in its original widescreen version  it is too good a movie to be pan and scan,1424995200,,231,3.693877551020408
4518643,5,B0050WLOSA,"This was the last War movie I watched before entering Marine Corps Boot Camp in 1973. Made a strong impression, so much that I went out and got a buzz hair cut after watching it., lol. After experiencing the real thing to a lesser degree, having traveled by ship in a combat unit and by sea and air, carrying wounded, being splashed by someone else's blood, coming home a 100% disabled veteran, I can say this movie hits the nail on the head at many levels.",1420675200,,457,4.325581395348837
4518644,5,B0050WLOSA,"Based on a novel by Anton Myrer, who also penned ""Once an Eagle"", a soap opera about tthe US Army 1917-1945; this story covers the exploits of the US Marines in the island hopping campaign of 1943-45. And it's a little soapy too. But a pretty good WWII movie. We center on three Marines, two recent grads/survivors of boot camp and their drill instructor who has befriended ( ?! ) them. WE satrt on liberty in San Francisco and are inyroduced to the families of the Marines and the women in and out of their lives. All in glorious technicolor. The two former ""boots"", now PFCs are played by actors who were rising on the Hollywood scene, Bradford Dillman and Robert Wagner. THeis was the first film that gave Wagner top billing. He does a pretty good job of maturing past the cowardly, ofter drunk, kid from a rough background, into a veteran. Often he injects humor through his character. Dillman is the rich kid who joined the Corps to get back at his father and escape a life outlined for him by societal expectations. His is the example of the ""You'll be Sorreeey"" jibe often yelled a new recruits by vets who have been there! The guy's D.I. is portrayed ab Jeffrey Hunter in what may be his best acting ever. The MarineCorps makes them blood brothers.
  There are ladies in this film too...pretty, young stars to be. They also help bring the soap into the opera. I will not go into that part of the story...see the film. The actresses here are: Dana Wynter, Hope Lange, France Nguyen, and Sheree North as a crazy dancing Navy WAVE opposite Wagner!  The combat enters the plot an hour into the film...on an unnamed pacific island placed under assualy by the USMC...it sort of blended all the stuff we have read about from many such places in WWII. Live fire exercises with the Navy and USMC make the combat sceenes work. There are scenes of F-4U CORSAIRS  we've seen in other films, but 99% of tye stuff is new to this movie. The viewer needs to pay close attention in the Amtrac approaching the beach and later on, where the Marines have dug in, to see Mort Sahl, a well known 1950s-60s stand up comic bring a little more humor into the plot where needed...especially sinch Wagner is no longer laughing now he's in combat. Mort Sahl was more than qualified to play this part....he was a WWII and Korea Marine.  Watch him and listen...you'll understand the headline I used.",1419465600,,2377,4.531468531468532
4518645,4,B0050WLOSA,"The first time I saw this film was in a theater.  The year was 1958 and I was seventeen. It's true that the format is not as originally seen.. nor am I the same, but my memory of this film did not disappoint.  It was, once again, worth the price of admission.",1413504000,,259,3.9615384615384617

4518647,4,B0050WLOSA,"A realistic look at the private lives of USMC personnel on embarkation leave prior to shipping out to the Pacific War.  It reveals that too often the people left behind do not realize that these young men have grown into manhood.  Each faces adversity of some magnitude and often they have to contend with their own personal difficulties before they become ""squared away"".  The action sequences are believable and the characters do come to terms with there demons.  It's ending was perfect for a follow-on film but it was never made.",1405987200,2,533,4.824175824175824

8451994,4,B0050WLOSA,"Three Marines on leave before deployment in 1944 visit their loved ones for a farewell, and work out their personal problems by the end of the film.  First hour is devoted to stateside, second hour alternates between the battleground and home.

Marines are seen boarding an LVT aboard an LST to head towards the beach, then land and unload.  Later they fight an American Stuart tank as a stand-in for a Japanese light tank.  Also has some shots of a Sherman flamethrower, and a Chaffee.  However, most of the screen time involves ground troops.  Some F4U Corsairs make a napalm drop at one point.",1433548800,,596,4.6826923076923075
8451995,3,B0050WLOSA,"Everyone should know that Fox Studios has little interest in investing in film preservation or high quality DVD & Blu-Ray releases for many of its classic titles. The studio executives just don't believe there is a viable market for these films. Other studios like MGM, Sony Pictures and even Paramount take pride in the legacy of their studios and realize there would be no studios were it not for these great stars of the past. Classic films are introduced to new younger audiences everyday. Myself included. I wasn't even born when these films were made but I love them more than anything!

I am a Marine Corps veteran & I love this film. Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Wagner teamed up for many films, most of which are not available to purchase. This film was used with a DVR- Recordable device. I have one at home and you just make your own DVDs from films on TV. The quality is poor and for Fox to do this is a true dishonor to the many stars and great films of this era.

Jeffrey Hunter, Hope Lange, Dana Wynter & Bradford Dillman - God bless you all and rest in peace. So sorry the studio you gave your talent and souls to doesn't honor your legacies enough to produce your films on a lousy decent quality DVD or Blu-Ray.",1432684800,4,1225,4.415929203539823
