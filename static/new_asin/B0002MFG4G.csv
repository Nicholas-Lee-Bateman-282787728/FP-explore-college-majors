8029285,4,B0002MFG4G,"The very, very bad one is the one that some people like best. It's called ""Gaydar"" and it's about--and possibly by and for--screeching queens who think it's funny to torment a pet cat (over and over) until it hisses (over and over) and finally runs away (That's not the central story, by the way, but it's what I remember). I don't deny such people's right to exist and make movies--I just don't enjoy their company. (The cat torture is what bothered me, by the way, and the consistent unfunniness of everything that happened--not the fact that they were screeching queens, whom I usually like.) I fast-forwarded through the last third of that piece of garbage to see if it got any better, and it didn't.

But the other six movies on this DVD are gems, the most consistently good and diverse collection of short gay films I've come across in a while.

Sure, ""Touched"" is a middle-aged gay man's fantasy that would never happen in a million years, but it's surprisingly fresh and lovely anyway, sweet, sad, and genuinely touching. What some have called the ""stiff"" performance of the lead actor just seemed to me like the way a real person, not an actor, might really be in such a situation.

Near the other end of the age spectrum is ""Burl's,"" in which the lead actor looks so young it made me a little uncomfortable. He's supposed to be in middle school, but he doesn't look any older than about nine. I assume, though, that he really must be older than he looked, and the story is original and delightful, particularly his encounter with the guys in drag.

I even enjoyed ""10 Pesos"" a lot; some other viewers evidently found it boring and irrelevant, but I liked it. It's clever and fast-paced, and the closing credits are the best I think I've ever seen, extraordinarily creative and as much fun to watch as the film itself.

""Masturbation"" is a little predictable, and not particularly original in parodying 1950s school hygiene films, but it is funny, the only one of these films that had me laughing out loud more than once.

""Safe Journey"" is similar to ""Touched"" in its bittersweet bringing together of an apparently mismatched younger and older man, but there's enough originality in both films that they don't seem at all like clones.

My only complaint about ""Shaving the Castro,"" an extremely short documentary about a barber shop, is that it was over much too soon. Saying that about any movie is a serious compliment.

I noticed that several of these films identify themselves as film-school projects, at least two from USC. Sometimes when reviewers want to put down a movie they'll say it seems like a film school project, but if these short films are typical, the kids are doing better work than the guys who run Hollywood.",1247788800,,2739,4.691666666666666
8029286,3,B0002MFG4G,"I bought this DVD for ""Gaydar"", having seen it at a film festival.  It is the best short of the collection... over-the-top campy humor.  The entire cast, from the main character to Frankalina to the feral cat, all put in great performances. (5 stars)

""Burl's"" is a short but sweet film about a boy who discovers his sexuality and how he wryly manages to negotiate his parents' attempts to change it.  Not groundbreaking cinema here, but entertaining enough. (4 stars)

""Touched"" I feel was overrated by some of the other reviewers.  I found it very poorly acted, with an implausible script (though the filmmakers claim it was based on a true story).  It was a bit too sappy and overwrought for my tastes. (2 star)

""10 Pesos"" was a pleasant surprise.  It was very slick and creative, demonstrating a wide range of society and what various people will do for money.  The gay theme is only tangential here, but the movie is done well enough that you don't mind. (4 stars)

""Safe Journey"" is about two men with different backgrounds and dissimilar challenges in life coming together for mutual support.  An unlikely pairing, tastefully presented. (3 stars)

""Shaving the Castro"" is an almost too-short documentary about a barbershop in the Castro.  While what was presented was very good, I think the filmmakers could have done more with the film with a little more digging.  They had a very good concept here  - the building and continuation of a community - but I wanted to see more!  (3 stars)

I really wanted to like ""Masturbation: Putting the Fun in Self-Loving"", but something was off here.  It seemed like the filmmakers were split between making this a true spoof of a 50's educational film, and making it a more modern comedy.  On the surface, it used the 50's ed film genre, but the actors - especially Dr. Winston and Billy - didn't really look like 50's characters, but more like 90's actors in a black and white movie.  The humor was also more outrageous and direct, when I would have expected more subtle innuendo as you would normally get in a satire.  Dr. Winston's brief scene during the credits also did not elicit that ""surprise"" laughter that you usually expect with an end credit scene.  Another film that spoofs 50's educational films with subtle sexual humor, but does it in a MUCH better way, is ""Billy's Daddy is a Fudge Packer""... check out for that one if you ever see it on a DVD collection.

8029289,5,B0002MFG4G,"I have to admit I watched this movie to see what happens to the cute guy on the cover.  What I found as I dug through the clips was that some of them were rather funny and campy (Gaydar for example) But Touched REALLY was good.  It was a tale of the guy on the cover as he goes into a gay bar and picks this guy up.  When they get to the older gentlemans place, the boy confesses a good deal to him about the troubles in his life, and there is quite a plot twist.  VERY moving and emotional stuff.  Buy it for Touched, stay for Gaydar.",1100563200,19,535,3.871559633027523
8029290,4,B0002MFG4G,"This is a collection of seven gay-themed short films.  As with any collection, the quality varies widely.  It is worth renting, if only for the hilarious short ""Gaydar.""  The premise is simple, a ray gun that indicates who is gay.  The writing, direction and performances in this film are all top notch.  It is the rare short that makes you wish it were a full-length movie.  Check it out!",1095897600,10,389,4.565217391304348
