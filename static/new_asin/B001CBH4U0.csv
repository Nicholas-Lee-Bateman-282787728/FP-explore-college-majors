8286517,4,B001CBH4U0,"Super Why DVD's are all great.  Our 36 month old child is already learning to ""read"" as a result of these Super Why DVD's.  They are the best visual tool on the market (IMO) to teach alphabet and word identification to a beginner .  My only criticism is having to sit through all the sponsor ads and previews that these PBS DVD's include on these purchased DVD's. When I put the DVD on my toddler will get tired of waiting for the story to start and will walk away if I don't sit and fast forward through a lot of ""junk"" before the real Super Why episodes begin.",1413590400,,562,4.185185185185185
8286518,4,B001CBH4U0,We do not own this DVD yet but we have watched the show on TV.  My 5 year old LOVES it and all the characters.  I think Wyett (sp?) is her favorite.,1250035200,,148,3.59375
8286519,3,B001CBH4U0,"My kid and I both love this show. He's almost 2, I'm 38. If that doesn't say enough I'll add that it is entertaining and educational, and we'd both sit and watch it all day if we could. However, at the time of this review, I'm seeing a price between 20 and 30 dollars for two episodes on one disc. I can't even believe my eyes. I would consider this for about half that price and it would be a ""maybe."" Again great show, can't say enough about it, I just wish it were a good deal as well.",1228089600,5,488,3.9393939393939394
8286520,5,B001CBH4U0,"My son, who is turning 4 soon, enjoys Super Why very much.  The materials in the DVD are very educational.  The show helps me teach him reading by himself and spelling.",1222473600,,168,4.387096774193548
8286521,5,B001CBH4U0,I can't find the videos anywhere.  We watch it everyday on PBS.  Can someone help me?,1220572800,,85,4.25
8286522,5,B001CBH4U0,"We have all of the shows (in wide screen HD) on our DVR.  I would love to own all of the Super Why DVDs.  Nothing holds my one year old's attention like Super Why.  I hope that more DVDs are available soon.

Another great buy are the Word World DVDs.  They are my son's second favorite, along with Big Big World.  We own all of the Big Big World DVDs.",1220400000,2,351,3.942857142857143
8286523,5,B001CBH4U0,"I wish that I could get more of the Super Why DVD's (Region 2) as they are worth it for the kids. I recommend all parents get this DVD for their kids, very educational and fun.",1219190400,,176,3.9166666666666665
8286524,5,B001CBH4U0,"I do not own this DVD, but we have seen these episodes on PBS, and it is an absolutely amazing show!  Probably the best kids show on TV for reading, and helps teach problem solving.  My son is 2 but he absolutely LOVES it, he loves to help with the letters, loves the songs, and pretty much everything about it.  I highly reccomend it for everyone!",1216598400,2,348,4.242424242424242
