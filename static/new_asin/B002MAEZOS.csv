8501604,5,B002MAEZOS,"Sound track on mine was fine. You should return your poor duplicate and exchange it for another, or get your money back. You must remember this was 1994. Without a major studio investment, you couldn't touch Canon's L-2 with interchanable, high quality lenses. It's history, not state of the art.",1288396800,,296,4.94
8501605,2,B002MAEZOS,This big wave classic of the VHS era does not convert across well to the digital format.  Vision was OK but the audio - on my copy anyway - was muffled to the extent that it was almost inaudible.  The music track on the other hand is LOUD - which is a bonus as the pre-modern grunge is just right for the menace which is Mavericks - but is not a bonus when the music cuts in while you have the audio wound right up to catch some scrapings of the interview dialogue. Keeps you on your toes with the remote.,1285200000,,505,3.99009900990099
