8536226,4,B0095R8JC0,"I became a fast and ardent Aamir Khan fan when I first discovered Bollywood in 2015. I started watching all Aamir Khan's films, which soon led me to purchase 1947 Earth. I liked it well enough then for the story of India's partition as told through the eyes of an 8-year old Parsi girl, and of course, Aamir's fine performance as the ice candy wallah (he's so cute!). However, even when I watched the movie the first time, I had thought it had an abrupt ending, but I figured that was the vision of the storyteller, and was meant as an impact on the world-view of Lenny as she grew up.

Just recently, I read the source novel, ""Cracking India"" by Bapsi Sidhwa -- which was really quite wonderful -- and caused me to go back and watch the movie again. One of the things I was looking for in the movie is that the novel seemed to have practically an entire other half I didn't remember from the film -- I actually wondered if maybe I missed a second disk or something?  Upon a second viewing of the film, I found out sure enough, the movie ends with credits rolling about 1/2 way through the story the novel tells; the movie version never shows the new Ayah or the search and rescue of the previous Ayah, nor the expeditions of mother and electric Auntie going out in the car on their mysterious journeys. The movie was still good, I stand by my original 4 star rating, and I highly respect Deepa Meeta as a film maker, but it is too bad the entire novel could not have been realized on screen, as it was a really good book.

Since most Bollywood movies are 2 1/2 to 3 hours long, and this was merely an hour and 45 mins, I almost feel it was incomplete. I would love to have had it be longer and complete the story and also have been able to see Aamir acting as the transformed ice candy wallah in Kotha as shown in the book, and all of the things that happened after the scene that ended the movie. Thanks for reading my review.",1521417600,,1928,4.219512195121951
