1193494,4,B000006GD6,"Where most movies about obsessions fail is in trying to make the obsession believable. Notable successes were the creepy The Collector and the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783225849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho (Collector's Edition)</a>, notable failures have included&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lolita/dp/B000UJ48VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lolita</a>&nbsp;and more recently,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lolita/dp/B00001IVFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lolita</a>.
I guess the problem is that obsession is such a perfectly internal state that we have no subtle physical markers for it. So the actor playing the obsessed character has to or tends to end up chewing the scenery to remind us that there is some unusual mental state behind his character's odd behavior.
By choosing a marginal character-one whose very vocation has overtones of sadomasochistic fascination, screenwriter Bunel avoids the necessity of writing a cartoonishly weird character and Bruce Dern is free to underplay the part believably.
Maud Adams is delicious and the poster may be one of the erotic classics of movie advertising.

1193495,4,B000006GD6,"I was quite pleased to finally find this movie at a video store seeing as it's been out of print for some time. I've been a fan of the luscious, high-cheekboned Maud Adams since her slinky appearances in two Bond movies, The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy.
Tattoo is a very intense story of one man's obsession with a woman and with a fetish. Bruce Dern plays roles like this so well. His character is a make-up artist who develops a fixation with a beautiful model (Adams) he meets on a job. Dern's real love is tattooing, and although he wins the girl over and has the chance to romance her in a normal relationship, he is unable to because of his pathology. He kidnaps her instead and exerts control over her until she willingly submits to having her flesh permanently marked by his needles.
The plot of lovesick men kidnapping/imprisoning the objects of their affection has been repeated many times, as in Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down, and Private Obsession, but Tattoo holds its own in this genre. The ending is shocking, yet fitting.",1071619200,12,1040,4.537234042553192
1193496,3,B000006GD6,"""Tattoo"" is a unique mystery that explores a tattoo artist who becomes dangerously obsessed with a model/actress.  Many twists and turns occur, keeping the mystery alive.  Though few other writers have constructed such theme, there are many flaws.  The kidnapping and the captive scenes could have been more detailed and more involved.  Most of those scenes would never occur in that level in real life, especially the victim's escape plans.  Despite such flaws, the storyline is highly creative.  The body art is highly enjoyable to view.  The high-tech effort involved in perfecting every detail and making them real-looking was highly noticeable.  They're flawless.  The acting was average.  There was some potential for improvement, but that never happened.  The actor behind the tattoo artist, the lead character, gave his character a deeply dangerous persona, giving the movie the extra mystery.  Such depth symbolizes the movie.  ""Tattoo"" may have mixed reviews toward its audiences.  It has good details; it has some that could use great improvement.  However, this will keep many entertained.",1071532800,6,1101,5.394117647058824
1193497,4,B000006GD6,"Karl (Bruce Dern) is an obsessed tattoo artist who kidnaps model Maddy (real-life model/actress Maude Adams).  Karl drugs Maddy and takes her to a secluded house.  Maddy awakens to find she has become a canvas for skin illustrations -- Karl is consecrating her body with tattoos.  A virtual prisoner, Maddy submits to becoming Karl's masterpiece and Goddess.
Some Pagan organizations conduct periodic rituals that include rededication to the Pagan God and Goddess -- voluntary tattooing can be a part of these rituals.  I consider ""Tattoo"" a flawed Creation story, however.  Bruce Dern plays Karl much like Anthony Perkin's ""Psycho"" role and Karl's secluded house resembles the house overlooking the Bates Motel.  Kidnapped Maddy passively submits to tattooing.  And I believe the exquisite pastel tattoos depicted on Maude Adams are not practical.  Most tattoos use dark saturated colors for patchability, and Maddy's pastel tattoos could not be patched artistically after abrasions, winter dryness, and sunburn peeling.  Maddy would be forced to become a hothouse plant to maintain her pastel tattoos' beauty.",1050710400,5,1111,5.488235294117647

Tattoo is more of a psychological drama, I found myself wondering what it would be like to have been in a position like that of Maude Adams' character...I was completely paranoid and even claustraphobic by the end of the movie!!!",1018310400,3,309,4.517857142857143

7904250,1,B000006GD6,"This movie is just straight up bad. Might've worked in the 80's for some, but dam is this a chore to get through. The idea is there, but the execution just lands with a thud. Bruce Dern is trying his hardest to elevate this turkey but he's only as good as his director and the script handed to him and they both let him down. Don't get me started on Maude Adams, yikes!",1490659200,,369,4.068493150684931

As for the end. Meh.  I guess what happened sometimes does happen in real life. Yes I'm being very unclear because I don't want to ruin the show! :)",1489363200,,307,4.368421052631579

7904254,2,B000006GD6,"I saw  this movie as a kid when it first came out with friends and watched it in someone's basement as junior high schoolers who were obsessed with the taboo of nudity and sex. We joked about watching it again in our 40's, and I was surprised how hard it was to find it anywhere! And why was it never re-released with such big name talent in it? Well....now I know! This is a terrible, messed up, mysogynistic movie that was very upsetting! Kidnapping, rape, mental illness, violence against women - all rolled up into one very disturbed movie. Some people talk about the great acting - well yeah sure, it's got real talent. But so do a lot of other movies worth your time. I do enjoy psychological intrigue movies with unstable characters, but at least one person has to have some redeeming qualities or something we can relate to. Try ""Gone Girl"" or other movies about obsession, betrayal and relationships. Leave this one to the dusty archives.",1424649600,,947,4.603550295857988

If your into tattoos and great art work, you will see it here.
Back when this movie came out it was a real thriller in 1980.
I still think it would be horrifying today if this happen to you and did not want this on your body put on by some maniac.",1378166400,2,299,3.918032786885246

This movie should be remade, even if it goes straight to DVD if the acting is descent it will sell a lot of copies.  Also This movie works on a lot of USA computers so if you can't play it on your dvd try to play it on you PC or laptop.",1310688000,2,429,3.7555555555555555
