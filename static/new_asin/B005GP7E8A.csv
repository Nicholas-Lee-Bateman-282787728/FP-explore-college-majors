8471990,3,B005GP7E8A,"A mess. Kinski wanted Herzog to direct this and H. refused, with good reason.

It's kind of like a 17th-century music video, with lots of slo-mo, constant violin, and Kinski as Paganini ravaging many women in a borderline-softcore kind of way. Kinski ends up looking with dark hair like Fred Armisen.

Kinski's passion for Paganini does not convince the viewer to share this passion. Unlike the great film Amadeus, in which we are gradually drawn into the life and times of the eccentric genius Mozart, Paganini is just a scattered assemblage of sound and image. It actually amounts to the worst kind of film experience because the viewer just doesn't care one way or the other.

I gave 3 stars because I admire Kinski's talent overall and this was his final film before he died of a sudden heart attack in Lagunitas, California -- ""burned himself out, like a comet,"" as Herzog put it. Kinski was all about being prolific, but in many of his films he was also a phenomenal, intense actor, so there was a high amount of quality amidst the quantity. This is not one of those performances/films.

If you are new to the world of Kinski, check out the Herzog documentary My Best Fiend and the 4 films Kinski made with H. Also cruise around in the Kinski canon, as he did westerns, bad scifi, a ""snakes in an apartment"" movie, war movies, a follow-up to Nosferatu that I was pleasantly surprised by, and so so many films. With so many films and roles he played, plus his notoriously stormy and complex personality, there are many ways to remember Kinski. There really is no one, definitive version.",1528848000,,1592,4.654804270462633
8471991,3,B005GP7E8A,"Films about composers are rare, and probably for good reason. Few can forget Hollywoods sickeningly sanitized version of Chopins life, A Song To Remember (1945) with Cornel Wildes Hallmark-style portrayal of the composer literally (and hammily) dying at the keyboard (of tuberculosis) after a grueling tour for the song to remember. It was Liberaces favorite movie for good reason. At the opposite end of the spectrum were the 1970 composer biopics by Ken Russell. Russell being Russell, these were, naturally, highly irreverent and decidedly idiosyncratic takes on Tchaikovsky (The Music Lovers), Mahler (Mahler), and Liszt (Lisztomania). Then came Milos Formans Academy Award winning film on Mozart, Amadeus (1984), which, though largely fictional, does capture the spirit, personality, and drive of the composer. If Formans triumph seemed to signal a new, respectable artistic trend in musical dramas, then along came Klaus Kinski with Paganini (1989) to prove that notion wrong. Script in hand, Kinski attempted to solicit Werner Herzog to direct the life story of the demonic 19th century virtuoso violinist, Niccolo Paganini. Kinski had long felt a strong identification with the famed musician and repeatedly implored Herzog to direct. Upon reading Kinskis treatment, Herzog deemed it an unfilmable mess. Not one to be dissuaded, Kinski, for the first and last time, took over the directors reigns himself . The result is absolutely the weirdest musical biopic ever made, and that is no exaggeration. It has aptly been referred to as Kinski Paganini since it as much a self-portrait as it is the composers portrait. Picasso once said every work of art, regardless of subject matter, is a self-portrait. Kinski Paganini is the second of two highly personal self-portraits Kinski left behind before dying at the age of 56 in 1991. The first is an actual autobiography, titled All I Need Is Love. Both works sparked an outrage amongst the status quo. Kinskis written manifesto has since come to be regarded as one of the great maniacal bios.

To call Paganini a biopic is a bit of a stretch. As Herzog predicted the film is a mess, and a repellent one at that; but it is such an individualistic mess that it demands attention. Kinskis film is an unquestionably disturbing example of what happens when the lunatics take over the asylum.

The film is available on DVD via Mya Communications in both the 84 minute theatrical cut, mandated by aghast producers, and Kinksis own, fourteen minute longer versione originale. With Kinskis cut, there is no reason to watch the theatrical version, which was an impossible attempt to downsize the directors monstrously egotistical vanity project.

Kinskis version opens with two priests, racing towards the dying musician. They bicker back and forth over whether they should offer last rites to that vile seducer of young girls. To make his point of hypocrisy about as subtle as a pair of brass knuckles, Kinski intercuts the carriage ride with shots of priests hands distributing the Eucharist to the awaiting, open mouths of nubile catechumens. The composers young son (played by Kinskis own son, Nanhoi) greets the priests and, upon learning their intent of attempting to solicit repentance from the dying composer, Jr. sends them packing. Like Kinski, Paganini obsessively dotes on his son (Nanhoi repaid the affection in 1991, being the only person who attended Klaus funeral). Kinskis Niccol&ograve; Paganini has almost no dialogue in the film but he does supply a judicious bit of voice-over: I am neither young nor handsome. Im sick and ugly. But when women hear the voice of my violin, they do not hesitate to betray their husbands with me. To drive that point home, the rest of the film is, essentially, a series of montages: Paganini plays his violin with searing intensity, women masturbate to him, Paganini plays, horses engage in sex, Paganini plays, crowds throng to him, Paganini plays, upper class society types deem him the devil, Paganini plays, women succumb to orgasmic heights, Paganini plays, Paganini has uninhibited sex in carriages, Paganini plays, young underage girls dance, Paganini walks through the streets-alone, silent, internally determined, Paganini dotes on his son, Paganini plays, Paganini has uninhibited sex in a field of flowers, Paganini plays, Paganini has uninhibited sex on an actual bed, Paganini dotes on his son, Paganini has more uninhibited sex, Paganini composes, Paganini plays, Paganini has even more sex, Paganini helps aspiring young musicians, clerics deem Paganini a rapist of underage girls, Paganini gives to the poor, the ill Paganini comes to increasingly depend on his son, Paganini gets sick and dies. The End.

Kinskis cut of the film is excessively graphic (bordering on pornographic), contemplative, and rapturous. The film itself, like both Paganini and like Kinski, is deranged, coarse, impassioned, libidinous, and artfully arresting. Unfortunately, Mya Communications very good transfer work is solely reserved for the theatrical cut. Kinskis versione originale is merely an extra, and that print remains unretouched, leaving the darkly lit interior scenes almost unwatchable. Pier Luigi Santis lush cinematography compliments the films excellent score of Paganini caprices. In addition to cutting the graphic sex scenes, the theatrical version omits the entire opening sequence with the priests, making an already disjointed film feel even more fragmentary. The dubbing is poor in both versions. The extras are a mixed bag. There is an indispensable, hour-long making of the film documentary, deleted scenes (from both cuts), the original trailer, and a bizarre Cannes press conference. Unfortunately, the cost of the set may require a second mortgage.

It was the theatrical version I saw in a dingy theater upon its release. I was one of ten patrons present. By the time the credits rolled, there were only two of us remaining. I was not sure whether the film was an adventurous masterpiece and/or an unfilmable mess, but I do think that any film that inspires eight out of ten people to walk out has to have something going for it.

8471992,5,B005GP7E8A,"A very provocative film by Klaus Kinski, naturally the different language simultaneous dub tell different things so the translation is not the same more or less from English to French to Italian & i heard different criteria between each so it helps to know more than one language. As for the film, is a must for every musician otherwise eccentric violinist or even keyboardist to own in your personal golden library of masterpieces.",1369353600,,432,4.931506849315069
8471993,2,B005GP7E8A,"The movie is a badly edited compilation of scenes that blurted from Kinski's mind at the end of his brilliant career. Could have been a brilliant story of a great musician with human flaws like everybody else but with a huge gift for the violin. Better watch the rest of his work, most very good since he didn't merely acted but he rather transformed his personality to the character he was portraying.",1338336000,2,402,4.597222222222222
8471994,3,B005GP7E8A,"This 2 disc set has 2 editions of the same film. Disc 1 is the theatrical version. Disc 2 is the Directors version.

The movie is loosely based on the life of Paganini the virtuoso violinist from the 1800s. He was the rock star of his era and apparently was intent on sleeping with every woman he encountered. The entire movie is just violin playing and hanky panky. The director's version just has more of the adult content. The sets and costumes are fine but the film gets old pretty fast.",1322870400,6,491,4.395604395604396
8471995,5,B005GP7E8A,"Kinski-Paganini is a beautiful interpretation of the great Violinist - and the one film that Mr. Kinski produced, directed and starred in. This is an excellent find for fans of Klaus Kinski as it shows what life was like for Paganini while interpreted by Kinski himself who was a true genius. Kinski throws himself completely into this role. He includes the brilliant musical techniques of Paganini, as well as the struggles of his personal life - sexual obsession, illness and then the beautiful relationship he had with his young son(who is played by Kinski's real-life son,Nanhoi). I'm sure every Kinski fan can notice the many similarities between the lives of Niccolo Paganini and Klaus Kinski, who believed he may have been the reincarnation of the violin virtuosi. Anyone who trully loves Klaus Kinski should own this special film. After all, Kinski created it!

8471996,3,B005GP7E8A,"Being a great admirer of Paganini, and open to portrayals of great artists in film, I was enthusiastic about this film. I used to have a VHS copy. Unfortunately, it was destroyed.

Kinski is made up to look like the Paganini we all know. Tall, gaunt, a bit ugly, and imbued with power. In the Paganini character, Kinski carried himself as a man who is absolutely certain of his talent.

The music is marvelous. I don't know who played the violin parts, but he / she did them justice. Most of the excerpts were from the 24 caprices, and the 2nd Violin Concerto in D Major.

One theme that recurred was the possibility that Paganini killed his wife. And the only tenderness and kindness he showed to another human being was toward his daughter. The death scene was what one would expect.

One other scene that showed the tender side of Paganini was when he happened upon a boy trying to earn money by scraping a pitiful tune on a violin. Paganini took the instrument, played his usual musical impossibilities, collected money from the onlookers he attracted, and gave the money to the boy - leaving them saying ""Paganini salutes you.""

However the movie jumps from past to present to memory to foreshadow of the future with nothing in the way of contrast. The effect is disorienting, and makes the plot, such as it is, a bit difficult to follow.

A few scenes were downright bizarre. One, where he was performing, and got on his knees and played the violin behind his head and with his teeth a'la Jimi Hendrix, to the utter confusion of the audience, made no sense whatsoever.

And every other scene seemed to involve him fornicating with hysterical Italian women who screamed at the top of their lungs while engaged in sexual congress. Evidently, Paganini and half the women of Italy went at it like warthogs in rutting season. It became tiresome; and one wondered how this left Il Maestro with any time to practice or compose.

The film is worth looking at, and if you are into idiosyncratic films (and have a PAL Reg. 2 DVD player), you may wish to add this to your collection.",1197849600,14,2078,4.5822102425876015
