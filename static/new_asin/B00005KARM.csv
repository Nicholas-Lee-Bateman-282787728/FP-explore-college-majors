7943085,1,B00005KARM,"Everyone has said it. The DVD isn't complete. Watch the webisodes and save your money.
If the comapny decides to release another, THEN get it. Or get this REALLY CHEAP, and pray the other parts are put out some day.
Either way, don't spend a lot for it.",1280793600,,253,4.291666666666667
7943086,1,B00005KARM,"When I heard the concept behind this DVD I thought COOL!!!!  So I bought it and threw it straight into the DVD player, but I think I might have thrown the ending out of the DVD player!!!!  How can you make a DVD with a cheesy but addictive storyline, and end it so quickly?????  I just don't get it????  If this DVD was complete I would say this is the coolest DVD I have ever bought!!!  I just hope more people make DVD's like this!!!!!",1026604800,,437,4.094117647058823
7943087,1,B00005KARM,"this dvd should be excellent but it just ends in the middle of the action, it not the full story you can get off the net as i thought it would be and as there are no more dvds in the series to buy at this time you can KISS the end goodbye!. please note if this kiss dvd had been the full story it would had rated 5 stars",1022112000,,320,3.585714285714286
7943088,4,B00005KARM,"This release took me by surprise. So I bought it and really enjoyed it. But, two things left me dissapointed.
One, the DVD ends on a cliff hanger without any sign of resolution. Two, the DVD shuts down, stops in mid-play, for no apparent reason. I contacted the company that released it and they never got back to me. Who knows it may be my DVD player?",1015200000,,352,4.268656716417911
7943089,5,B00005KARM,"I UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE WAS UPSET, BUT THIS WAS A COOL LITTLE ANIMATED MOVIE WITH THE REAL VOICES OF KISS. IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS HOPING TO GET DISNEY ANIMATION SAVE YER CASH! HOWEVER DISNEY DOESN'T HAVE ANY KISS FILMS SO THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING. THE CHOOSE YOUR OWN PATH WAS QUITE A GREAT FEATURE, IT DOES LEAVE YOU OFF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A LONG STORY...THAT MADE ME RUN RIGHT OVER TO THE WEB SITE TO FIND OUT THE REST!
I AM ASSUMING THAT THERE WILL BE A 2ND PART, 3RD PART, AND SO ON ABOUT THEM. I CAN'T WAIT! I WILL BE ORDERING THEM AS THEY COME OUT. I HAVE A GREAT WAY OF SHARING KISS WITH MY KIDS, AND THEY LOVE IT. ALL THUMBS UP FOR THIS FLICK!! YOU CAN ROCK AND ROLL OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER...",1006128000,3,718,3.9246575342465753
7943090,2,B00005KARM,"This DVD is based off the web series KISS Immortals.  Did someone forget to include the remaining 2/3 of the story on the DVD? Imagine going to the movie theater to see the hottest release, and having it cut off just when the action starts. I'm extremely dissapointed in this Product. It overpromises and underdelivers. I'm not even sure why any retailer in their right mind would carry this mockery.  My advice to you is: Don't buy it! You will be extremely dissapointed.",997228800,4,472,4.674698795180723
7943091,2,B00005KARM,"After eagerly awaiting the DVD release of KISS Immortals, I was extremely disappointed to realize that only 9 of the 27 Webisodes are on the DVD! Not only that, the DVD will not skip ahead chapters and trying to fast forward reacts in a funny way too. Being a KISS fan from 1974, and viewing and saving all the webisodes from Bright Digital Entertainment, This DVD was truly disheartening to say the least. If the producers don't come out with the follow up DVD's to complete the story, then seriously save your hard earned cash and don't buy this one.
You've been warned!",993513600,,572,4.563106796116505
7943092,3,B00005KARM,"..its a shame you won't get the best though.
Kiss Immortals was probably one of the most anticipated DVD releases for me. I loved the webisodes and was looking forward to being able to watch them all on my DVD player. Imagine my shock and surprise to discover that the DVD only carries 9 of the 27 episodes. Just when you're getting into it..the credits roll. Disappointment is all I can express, especially since I know all the fantastic parts that were not included. For example..why even release it with the title of Kiss Immortals when any and all sections relating to Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter in their Immortal personas are not even included. What really peeved me off the most was that NO WHERE was there to be found information stating that the DVD release only included the first 9 episodes. Had I have known I would have saved my hard earned money.
All I can hope is that the remaining 18 episodes are coming on a soon to be released DVD. My advise to you is that if you have a connection fast enough..save your money and watch the full series on the Kiss Immortals website.",993340800,7,1084,4.452261306532663
