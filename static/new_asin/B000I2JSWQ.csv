8143594,5,B000I2JSWQ,"If you like classically ridiculus anime then this is for you. The animation is  lively and the english voice acting is done very well, you'll recognize the voices from the game as well as many other animes. The story is simple enough and the characters are likable.

I have played Disgaea for the PSP and the stories differ, but its enteresting to see how the stories are different. And if you are a fan of the game the character designs are also straight out of the game. So go in with an open mind if you've played the game, you'll rarely find any book, comic, game, or manga thats an exact match when its translated to another medium.

Personally even if I hadn't played the game I think I still would have enjoyed this.",1202601600,3,723,4.380597014925373
8143595,5,B000I2JSWQ,"I'm only vaguely familiar with the video game this anime series is based on.  On the plus side that means I can safely say you don't need to know the game to enjoy this fun series.  The characters are fun to watch, with voices that do them justice.  Even the English dub isn't too bad, a rarity in anime, though I'll still watch it in the original Japanese with subtitles.  I've seen the first 2 volumes and just picked up the third and final volume and I can't wait to see how it all turns out.  Disgaea does not disappoint.",1178582400,5,525,4.21
8143596,1,B000I2JSWQ,"Let me warn you before you go collecting the entire series.

Either I got stuck with a bootleg knock-off version of the anime, or the trailer for the Disgaea anime, as seen on the Disgaea 2 PS2 game, is some of the most deceptive advertising ever.

There are parts which are wildly different from the game, such as Laharl's coffin being thrown away in a rubbish heap, only to be discovered by Flonne, as opposed to Laharl's coffin still being discovered in the castle by Etna (the second is what you see in the trailer, and what actually happened in the game, the first is what you actually see in the anime).

Some things actually happen similarly to how they happened in the game, but with poor execution, namely the Prinnies' migration to the Red Moon, and the whole conspiracy between Vulcanus and General Carter.

Introductions to other favorite characters such as Gordon, Jennifer, Thursday, and Mid-Boss are all ill-timed, and entirely different to how they were introduced in either the original game, or the trailer. Other generic Disgaea soldiers and demons are also given screentime, if only to convince you're actually watching something that is supposed to have even a remote iota to do with the original game.

Let it also be stated that the animation quality and style are all also very dated, even for 2003, when it was actually produced, though it hasn't been released in the U.S. until now.

The only redeeming episodes were those which were entirely new material, yet really cliche material you could do with any show. Episode 3, in which Flonne and Etna switch personalities, and another episode, in which Laharl discovers he has an alleged younger sister.

Otherwise, other than that, I would stick with the story as given in the game. I just can't believe this is the Disgaea anime...it's not what I was promised.",1173139200,8,1835,4.806349206349206
