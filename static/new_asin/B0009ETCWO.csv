8059759,3,B0009ETCWO,"In 1997, former&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Ninja/dp/B00005N89J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Ninja</a>&nbsp;Michael Dudikoff and director Rick Jacobson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bitch-Slap/dp/B003498RD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bitch Slap</a>) so thoroughly ripped off the previous years&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Executive-Decision/dp/B0045HCJFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Executive Decision</a>&nbsp;with ""Strategic Command"" here that its hard to imagine how they avoided a lawsuit. A decade later, Steven Seagal returned the favor by blatantly remaking Dudikoffs&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Thunder/dp/B000077VQN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Thunder</a>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-of-Fury/dp/B000LPR6G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight of Fury</a>. Whatever the dynamics behind this odd reciprocation between stars, Dudikoff/Jacobsons offering is actually the sincerer form of flattery, for despite its knockoff status, its a pretty serviceable adventure  a little too light on the action for my taste, but excelling in most other important areas.

The story: When a terrorist unit hijacks an airliner and threatens to detonate a devastating chemical weapon over America unless their demands are met, the designer of the weapon (Dudikoff) joins a Special Forces team to board the plane mid-flight and neutralize the threat.

I never thought Id see the day when Michael Dudikoff becomes a cooler guy than Kurt Russell, but it happens in this film: Dudikoff and Russell play virtually the same role in their respective films, and the formers infinitely more active and able take on the part is the one way that Command decisively outshines Decision. Rick Jacobsons lively direction and maximization of resources helps a lot, making for a movie thats smaller-scaled than its original but no less professional-looking and, arguably, more fun. A great cast that includes Amanda Wyss, Paul Winfield, and Jsu Garcia keeps the plot energized and upbeat, thereby creating a tone thats fairly breezy for an action-thriller.

The always-welcome Richard Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shanghai-Express/dp/B000NVT0SY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shanghai Express</a>) plays the terrorist leader, and in addition to being a fun menace, he helps supplies the movies action highlights via three hand-to-hand fights with Dudikoff (one of them is even good). Other than that, the adrenaline scenes are limited to a handful of gunfights, including several ill-advised ones on the plane. The film leans disproportionately on the latter aspect of its action-thriller label, and I consider this a bad idea given that its not nearly as serviceable of a nail-bitter as the movie its aping. The fun characters help keep viewers involved, but theres nothing here in terms of excitement that you won't find anywhere else.

The movie teeters on a higher rating from me. I have a feeling that fans of Dudikoff will consider this one a favorite, but I could have used a bit more substantial action. Nevertheless, I cant speak too strongly against this one, and thus Ill give it an unenthusiastic recommendation: catch it on TV or lift it from the bargain bin.",1439424000,,3457,6.865603644646924

8059766,5,B0009ETCWO,"I was expecting the usual fair when watching ""Strategic Command"".  After all, most movies featuring Michael Dudikoff promote tons of action.  Albeit there was plenty of action in this movie, it was distributed via suspense with regards to plot. Yes this movie has a decent storyline with elements of political espionage. The narrative is quite simple, maybe even trite; Dudikoff plays a former Special Forces agent now scientist (a bit far fetched) who is working on a material called ""Bomax"", which can kill a person in ten seconds. Another side effect of ""Bomax"" is a substance that resembles milk is vomited by the victim moments before they buy the farm.  It is never really unmasked why ""Bomax"" was made; it is more or less a plot device.

Well it isn't too long before some terrorists steal the Bomax and hijack an airplane that not only has the Vice President of the USA, among other individuals, but Dudikoff's wife (Amanda Wyss who was in the 80s cult classic ""Better off Dead"").  I have to say that the flight sequences utilized in this movie were pretty cool and it didn't appear to be stock footage. Digressing to the villains, I want to say that these terrorists are quite a motley crew, right down to the lone female of the group that resembles Lara Croft.

So now it is up to Dudikoff to stop the terrorists.  How is this done? Can he save his wife and protect National Security?  In order for answers a person needs to get his/her grubby little paws on this DVD. Therefore the answer to Dudikoff's quagmire can be solved.  In all honesty, this was a pretty good flick, for a lower budget movie.  ""Strategic Command"" isn't going to win any awards and hasn't broken any new ground, but it was a great way to spend 90 minutes.",1249862400,8,1739,4.598705501618123

I bought this DVD because Richard Norton is in it. I enjoy his movies and this one also included Michael Dudikoff.

The two work well together and help to create a very entertaining story that will keep the viewer interested and will keep the audience guessing with its many twists and turns.

Excellent action and a couple of great fight scenes make this DVD worth buying.",1237420800,,380,4.641791044776119
