Its deeper then that and much faster pace.its about relationship of father and son,Guilt ,war, Love,High Tech. it had potential to be classic but studio forced ending stopped it from standing in its own genera .I`ll not give spoilers but after watching you can guess what i`m talking about .Enjoy it and commit on ending afterwards if you want .

Nutshell story (imdb transcript) is about a soldier who wakes up in the body of an unknown man and discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train.",1302307200,2,689,4.694214876033058
4496658,4,B004XQO90E,"Source Code is an exhilarating movie. It is fast paced, without losing a deep story and emotional connection. The movie puts it's main character in a tense scene, having to find a person who is about to blow up a train. It throws the character(played by Jake Gyllenhaal very well) back into this scene over and over again, with small conversations in between.

The story is complex and emotional. It lets Jake's character expand and deepen, and the supporting cast is great. The special effects are well done, and the whole tone keeps you on the edge of your seat. Surprisingly, there is no campy dialogue (something I was expecting from the previews) and it is actually a superb script, making conversations interesting, and later scenes racked with emotion.

The whole movies is very great, leaving you excited by its presentation and quality in every aspect in it. The idea to replay a scene over and over again is executed really well, and makes the film very exciting. It is the first truly great film of 2011. I recommend it, to everyone.",1302220800,158,1044,4.730769230769231
4496659,4,B004XQO90E,"Helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a commuter train in the body of another man just moments before the train is destroyed by a bomb.  He learns that he is part of a mission to find the bomber, and that's all I feel comfortable saying.  Director Duncan Jones and writer Ben Ripley allow us to share Colter's confusion, and the main pleasure of this intelligently scripted film is watching him discover not only the identity of the bomber but the true nature of his assignment.

Most science fiction films are really action movies or horror films, so it's nice to see one that relies on clever writing rather than special effects.  Jones infuses his thriller with a believable and touching love story through the introduction of Christina (Michelle Monaghan), a doomed fellow commuter.  I missed Jones's first film, ""Moon,"" but now I want to see it.",1301875200,4,874,4.8389261744966445
4496660,5,B004XQO90E,"Source Code is a suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent, occasionally touching, movie that's far better than I'd expected it to be. With tight pacing, great editing, good acting and fine directing by Duncan Jones, best known for Moon, it's a very good sci-fi action film released outside the usual summertime area for such movies.

The film tells the tale of a man (Jake Gyllenhall), who wakes up on a train. He has no idea why he's there or who the woman across from him is. As he's trying to get things sorted out, an explosion goes off, killing everyone. He then comes to inside a capsule where it's explained to him that the train was blown up in a terrorist bombing. The terrorist was kind enough to do a practice run and apparently plans to detonate a dirty bomb in Chicago. Due to some sort of ""quantum"" effect he can ""leap"" into the body of a man who died on the train and live out his last eight minutes of life. Doing that will, with luck, enable him to find the bomber.

If it's a premise that sounds familiar, that's because it is. It's perhaps no surprise that Scott Bakula's voice turns up in a cameo during the movie, since it clearly owes a lot to his most famous work. In fact, it's basically Quantum Leap mashed-up with Groundhog Day while managing to be better than the first and at least as engaging as the second.

There was really nothing I disliked about this film. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best film I've seen so far this year, and, sadly, will likely be the best science fiction film for quite some time.",1301875200,178,1545,4.395104895104895

The action alternates between the man trying to understand the mission, and the time he spends on the train. This is a riveting action drama, with a premise that is unlikely, but somehow is believable in the context presented. He develops a relationship with an attractive woman on the train, a friend of the man that he is pretending to be. He has to go back to the train several times, trying to figure out who the bomber is. Even if the bomber is identified, will he save everyone on the train, or have circumstances already predetermined their fate?

4496662,4,B004XQO90E,"Imagine waking up on a train.  You don't know how you got there.  You don't know who the lady sitting across from you is, even though she seems to know you.  Your last memory is flying helicopters in Iraq.  Looking in the mirror you don't see your face...you see someone else.  Your driver's license says, ""Sean"" - not your name.  Then the train explodes and you are consumed in a ball of fire.  Only you don't die.  You wake up in a metallic chamber surrounded by wires, a screen on the wall.  Eventually a woman tells you that the train was real and had been bombed by terrorists who threatened to strike again.  The machine you are in is called the Source Code.  It lets you relive 8 minutes of someone's life, someone from the train, in a sort of alternate universe which mirrors our exactly.  Your mission is to discover the terrorist within the Source Code so that they can be stopped in your world before detonating a dirty bomb.  You will repeat the assignment until complete.

What do you do?

This is what happens to Coulter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhall) in Source Code.  The lady across from him is Christina (Michelle Monaghan), who apparently knows Sean from the daily commute into Chicago.  Vera Farmiga plays Goodwin, the woman who gives Coulter instructions between jumps, and Jeffrey Wright plays Dr. Rutledge, the creator of the Source Code.

Duncan Jones directs this fast paced sci-fi thriller without ever losing sight of the plot or the characters.  With each jump back into the Source Code, we learn more about Coulter and about Christina.  Duncan also doesn't let supporting characters fade into the background too, as Goodwin is given plenty of opportunity for character development.

Out of all of the movies or TV shows to use the Groundhog Day effect, this is probably the best I've seen it used.  Usually this effect is random, and continues until the character makes the right choice, after which the story finally progresses outside of whatever time loop has been created.  Groundhog Day is the most famous example of this, though I have seen several Star Trek episodes utilize the same technique.  It's almost a choose-your-own-adventure for the characters, especially since they soon realize death just starts the loop over again.

One of the great things Source Code does to break out of the clichs in this effect is the have an outside story.  Between loops, Coulter returns to the real world (I say real world for lack of a better word since an alternate reality could still be considered real).  His jumps happen after the actual terrorist bombing, and the terrorists promised to strike again.  This gives an excellent ticking clock in the script, and great incentive for the bomber to be found, because real lives are at risk.  Also, he is given only 8 minutes, which is an incredibly short length of time.  This helps ratchet up the tension as well.

The entire cast is excellent, giving their characters real emotion.  It is great to see the relationship between Coulter and Christina grow, even though at the beginning of each jump Christina is no longer aware of any developments.  Also, Goodwin agonizes over her ability to help Coulter.  Rutledge is her superior and seems to want Coulter more in the dark about full details surrounding the event that Goodwin thinks are necessary.

Coulter himself is just a great character.  His last memory is of being on active duty in Iraq.  Between then and waking up after his first time on the train in the Source Code there are no memories.  Since the Source Code is an identical/alternate reality he uses those 8 minutes on the train to not only try to search for the bomber, but also piece together what happened to him.

That said, there are weaker moments in the story.

The first is that after returning from his first time on the train, Coulter is almost immediately sent back and is told to find the bomb.  Goodwin and Rutledge don't want to waste time - they need to find the terrorist.  However, it isn't until a couple of jumps later that they finally tell Coulter why they need to find the bomb.  Until that point, he thinks it's just a training simulation.  While it is funny to watch Coulter treat it as a simulation, it doesn't make any sense for him not to know about the terrorist bombings.

Second, though the relationship progressed nicely between Coulter and Christina, there were a few cheesy moments.  It seems hard to do good scenes with romantic tension in a sci-fi movie.

Still, this is an excellent movie, and easily the best movie I have seen so far this year.  If you enjoy a good sci-fi or thriller, this should be an enjoyable movie.

This is Duncan Jones' 2nd film, his first being Moon, one of the best Science Fiction movies in recent years.  I deeply hope Jones continues to direct smart, engaging sci fi movies.  We need something to balance out Transformers.

4496663,3,B004XQO90E,"***SPOILER ALERT!***

Good movie, plot clicks along, lots of action--as one reviewer pointed out, a nightmare Groundhog's Day with lots of special effects. Captain Colter Stevens(Jake Gyllenhaal) is a USAF pilot whose unit was decimated in a catastrophic attack in Afghanistan. Colter regains consciousness and finds himself enmeshed in what he thinks is a training exercise. He's forced to relive an eight-minute loop where his mind/personality inhabits a passenger (an unassuming suburban schoolteacher)on a Chicago communter train that gets blown up. His job is to figure out which passenger planted the bomb so that a worse attack can be averted. Each time Captain Stevens ""returns"" to the train, he gets a little closer to identifying the bomber, and a little closer to realizing he's in love with a fellow passenger. At that point, he decides to change the mission: instead of just giving his handlers information about an event that already took place and cost hundreds of lives, he wants to re-shape the past so that the killer is caught before the train ever blows up.

Gyllenhaal does a good job: he goes from befuddlement at finding himself on a train that then explodes to, on subsequent trips back, having a laser-focused plan to disarm the bomb and nail his guy within the allotted time frame. He also developes the character of the pilot who frantically tries to piece together his personal reality--going from a war zone to a ""test pod""--while the people giving him orders evade his questions.

But of course, Hollywood never misses the opportunity to miss an opportunity. Predictably, the first person Capt. Stevens suspects as the bomber is a South Asian-looking (ie., Muslim) guy who seems nervous and edgy, and who exits the train at an unusual stop. Every single person in the audience knew that this was the lesson: Stevens assumed the guy was a terrorist because he profiled him, but the profile was WRONG.

(I don't think it's a plot-spoiler to say that the actual bomber is a banal yet psychotic American unconnected to any hate group.)

This was dissonent and not a little manipulative. The chief scientist for the ""source code project"" that sends Stevens on his missions makes specific references to the War on Terror. We know that the War on Terror involves organized global groups with agenda to activate operatives who will carry out attacks to achieve their goals--9/11, Bali, London, etc. Yet we're expected to believe, according to Source Code, that the real war on terror is focused on random mass murderers who are anomolies like Tim McVeigh lone wolves leading unremarkable lives. That's because Hollywood has agreed that the only reference to Muslims, in this post-9/11 world, have to depict them as innocent, and often framed, victims of suspicion. That's just as unrealistic and unfair as viewing all Muslims as terrorists.

This movie would have gone from ""pretty good"" to ""great"" if the writer had made two significant changes: 1) if Gyllanhaal, on his first mission, looks in the mirror and sees not a Joe Average non-Muslim history teacher but rather a young imam, and 2)if the terrorist was indeed an al-Qaeda jihadist on assignment.

The movie would had sacrficed none of its suspense and character development,but the audience would have seen--in Gyllanhaal, who did indeed play the Prince of Persia--a Muslim who FIGHTS terrorism, underscoring the fact that Muslims and terrorists are not mutually inclusive groups. It would have shown that Muslims can risk their lives to defend the US and its values, and it would have given Muslims another narrative to embrace: neither terrorist nor victim, but patriot who is willing to recognize jihadist groups and take them down.

It's too bad the writing/production team chickened out on this element. ""Source Code"" remains a decent movie, but not one that has the earmarks of a classic.

If Gyllanhaal had been the anti-jihadi, though, this movie would have been explosive...on many levels.",1301702400,2,3980,5.073394495412844
4496664,4,B004XQO90E,"Director Duncan Jones, the man behind the small scale and well crafted film Moon, returns with an equally fascinating mystery that doesn't outstay it's welcome at just over 90 minutes long. To be honest, I didn't plan on seeing Source Code before yesterday. The trailer was a little on the weak side and the story seemed predictable, but those pesky critics can sometimes get me to the theater, especially if almost all of them are in universal agreement that the movie is really good.

It's hard to describe this film without giving too much away. The main character (Jake Gyllenhall) has been given the ability to go back in time over and over again, for only 8 minutes a pop, in order to stop the train he is riding on from blowing up. There is a lot more to it than that of course. The government is behind the mission and the time traveling technology and there are many other twist and turns along the way, so I won't go into heavy detail here.

The cast is good, but it doesn't feature a standout performance like the one Sam Rockwell gave in Moon. Then again, the clever script doesn't call for a one man show this time around.

I was pleasantly surprised with this sci-fi/thriller/mystery hybrid. It's worth a trip to the theater or a future rental at the very least. Source Code is something along the lines of what Alfred Hitchcock might be making if he was around today.",1301616000,56,1382,4.52
4496665,4,B004XQO90E,"Duncan Jones pretty much made me a fan of his for life with his debut feature, Moon. The way the storyline unfolded along with Sam Rockwell's amazing performance, Moon was easily my favorite film of 2009. Also, seriously, how was Rockwell not even nominated for an academy award for that movie? So as word started making the rounds for Source Code being Jones' second film, I was immediately excited. While most people seem to be looking forward to Thor, Green Lantern, or Captain America this year, Source Code was actually my most anticipated film of the year. While Source Code isn't quite as impressive as Moon, it still has enough of Jones' strengths as a filmmaker along with a dash of originality injected into it to make it an extremely entertaining experience.

The camera always seemed to be at just the right angle in this film. During the film's opening, the way we're looking down at the tops of skyscrapers from the heavens and practically gliding across ponds with ducks grazing the top of them as they fly made something simple seem so extraordinary. Sometimes it felt like you were on that train watching these people be engulfed in flames because of the camera work. A scene in particular where Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is handcuffed to a pole while Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) is crouched down next to him when the train explodes is a great example. You've probably seen part of it in some of the trailers. The slow-motion effect used in that scene is fantastic. It lets your brain process just how devastating this train bombing really was. There's another scene near the end of the film that uses the freeze frame technique and is done incredibly well, especially considering the context of the film at that particular moment. Duncan Jones and/or the crew he works with really seems to know how to use a movie camera in the best of ways.

The originality in the film delves a little bit deeper than the trailer lets on. The concept of Source Code was enough to reel you in, but the way things unravel is what makes it special. Colter Stevens is a helicopter pilot from Afghanistan, but he can't seem to recall how he first arrived in the pod he now finds himself trapped in and he doesn't recognize the company he now works for. The source code is so much more than what anyone could have imagined including creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright). Letting your mind wander and consider the possibility of technology like this actually existing is pretty astounding, but the other amazing factor about the storyline is the fate of Colter Stevens and what he has already gone through. Speaking of fate, the film's storyline is practically intertwined with it but the way it's revealed is certainly something to behold.

Jake Gyllenhaal handles the role of Colter Stevens very well. Seeing how the source code affects the state of both his body and mind is half of the beauty of his performance. The way frustration, determination, love, and inevitability is handled by Gyllenhaal's character is quite a sight to see. Michelle Monaghan plays the clueless love interest rather well, but she seems to risk life and limb more often than not for a man she once claimed she didn't know well enough to trust. Making the most of those last precious moments is the overall theme and it's safe to say that the film and its actors get that point across incredibly well.

Source Code seems to be lacking that standout performance that Moon had, but still features a strong cast, a director who knows his way around a camera, and a sharp storyline that makes you think and is both original and compelling. Source Code is an incredibly solid thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat one minute and makes you ponder your existence the next.",1301616000,3,3768,4.739329268292683

4496699,5,B004XQO90E,"Source code , directed by Duncan Jones(2011), Moon, (2010) Warcraft (2016);  What if science could create reality using quantum physics, inside a virtual loop, inside a virtual window, inside the human mind?  What if, there existed a super computer, capable of traveling through time to alter reality in real time, and hop scotch back and forth from one parallel dimension to another? What if, science could discover, via quantum mechanics, that the brain is like an electromagnetic field,and, could, even after death remain viable, electrically charged with all circuits remaining open? What if, in addition to this hyper-charged field of energy, science could tap into this field, this memory bank (so to speak); a short term memory track whose parameters were limited in time to an eight minute window , allowing the brain to act like a video recorder; storing  data and information, remaining viable even while post mortem. This ""memory bank"" would enable science to capitalize on the overlap, the gap in between. What if this overlap could be labeled the ""source code"", enabling science to determine that memory is not inside the brain, but, according to the scientist in the movie, Dr. Ruttledge (Jeremy Wright), memory resides outside of the brain and the mind and resides in the collective  space and that the brain acts like an antenna, creating a virtual reality?
In the movie ""Source Code"", science has figured out a way to ""re-assign time"" or travel through time to reverse the affects of a terrible chaotic tragedy. A dirty bomb explodes on a train in Chicago, and another one will go off , unless, science can utilize both biology and physics, quantum physics to go backward in  time, discover the terrorism involved with the heinous act.
Amoung the many people that die, one man, Sean Fentris dies, but scientist manageer to recover his body for their experiment in ""Time Re-assignment"" or time travel. He matches the physiology, gender, biochemistry of an Airforce captain named Colter Stevens(Jake Gylenhaal), Donnie Darko(2001), The Day after Tomorrow(2004), Broke Back Mountain(2005).
Captain Colter Stevens body resides in a box, presumedly alive only via electrodes and external life support, with no legs, and whose consciousness and mind is linked with Sean Fentris. the magic of Hollywood  and the science fact/ fiction??? of quantum physics/theory  create a ""Ground Hog Day"" (the movie 1992), affect. The loop, the experience of reliving the explosion over and over, in an effort to discover who is behind the bombing of the train. That, is the captains' job, with the help of the airforce technology ""source code"".  Meanwhile, in the back drop of this detective story/ science exploration into the world of quantum mechanics, Sean Fentirs, aka, Captain  Colter Stevens, somehow glimpses his image in the widow of the fast moving train in Chicago and notices the image is different than the image he sees in the mirror. This ripple is like a wobble in his universe because now he has to argue with the ""Mad Scientist"" Dr Ruttledge (Jeffery Wright), (2004) Manchurian Candidate; (2005) Syrianna, (2008) James Bond Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace; (2013) Hunger Games; Catching Fire.
He is a quantum physics genius, and in collaboration with the US Airforce, has created  and engineered the Source code technology. Walter Ruttledge is a self absorbed scientist who, according to the director Duncan Jones , is both caring and compassionate, as long as everything involve his technology. Captain Stevens, well, his avatar??? loops back and forth through time and space, and , like a detective, must analyze the events of surrounding the bombing, while riding the train, discover who or what ignites the explosion. Only, the universe intervenes. The lovely Cristina Warren played by Michelle Monahan ( 2006) Mission Impossible 3; Gone Baby Gone(2007) Made of Honor(2008); becomes as important as the Captains' overriding mission, and soon, eclipses his mental focus.

The Captain wants to save the day and get the girl too!..This is where it all gets wonky... because up til now, for me anyway, it all seems plausible within the enthusiastic world of science fiction and nearly science fact... then,  I wondered what else the director worked on and I discovered his work (Moon, 2010). This work helped me to understand the man in the box, the scope and significance of the virtual reality element and how Mr Jones was using this in his story. In the movie ""Moon"", corporate imperatives attempt to marroon  employees used to mine Helium derivities while cloning human elements. Kevin Spacey playes the artificial intelligence robot ""Gerty"".  I finally  got the connection.
Unlike the science in the movie DE JA VU, where scientist use artificial intelligience and virtual reality to create a window in time that last 4 minutes, unable to go backward only able to move forward, to catch a killer, before he blows up a ferry carrying naval personnel and the families in New Orleans Louisianna, Source code does not attempt to delve into the science so much as it tries to create a ""Ground Hog Day"" effect. But unlike the movie ""Ground Hog Day"" where Bill Murray  (Ghost Busters) (Saturday night Live),  must experience the same day over and over and over because he is trying to get the girl, who is all he can think about.  The actress, Addie MacDowell,  is so beyond Bill Murrays character in every way that his obsession turns, morphs, into some supernatural field.. Puxutoney Phil popps his head out of the ground on Feb 2. this means, if memory serves, that this small town in Pennsylvania has observed years of tradition, and there will be 6 more weeks of winter.  MacDowells' character thinks Murrays character is superficial, opportunistic, artificial, self absorbed, crast,fake and phoney. He is the exact opposite of her. He has no insite , no self awareness, so he goes around and around, he has to, to figure out what she is about and to figure out what he's about. He does doscover a few thiings about himself, but he does not gain enlightenment. He does get layed, which seems to be the whole point. He still is a schmuck. However, in Source Code, THE PRIME objective is to catch the terrorist to thwart the future bomb timed to destroy the entire city and possible uncover a terrorist cell. The infatuation , if it can even be labeled that, doesn't seem real.  And this is because, there is the man in the box, hooked to electrodes, having his consciousness cyphoned out to feed the source code technology.  That is my take..I am sticking to it>>> Loved this movie....",1510272000,2,6652,4.996383363471971

SPOILER ALERT:

Like the movie Ground Day, a person re-living in a continuously the same time loop every day.

A the physically injured soldier's conscious is injected in the digitally recorded time loop (source code) where a bomber was successful in killing a train-load of people. His orders is to determine who the bomber was, and he ordered to prevent the bomb from going off. It is a dramatic and suspenseful theme to this movie compared to Ground Day. The solders will re-live the time loop over many times over until he changes the outcome of the event by prevent the bomb from going off thus change the future.

The acting is first rate propelled on the strength Jake Gyllenhaal's dichotomy.  I have a crush on Michelle Monaghan since ""Gone Baby Gone"", and was not disappointed.  Vera Farmigat's performance isn't up to her work in ""The Departed"" though it's a smaller role that used her ability to weigh mortal conflict with intelligence.

If you like sci-fi or time travel this movie is for you.

The actors were solid, but the script was weak. Moments that should have been heartbreaking or groundbreaking are met with lines of the sort of ""Everything is going to be ok"". Thats the best you can come up with?

Its super fast paced, so you will get hooked on right from the beginning. It should have been longer, they had chances to explore more issues about the experimentation. Like I said, very good idea but poor script.

Hey, future me, if you haven't seen this since 9-2-16, and it's, like, a year maybe -- see if this film is finally on Netflix streaming -- it'll be worth a look -- just to see if this thing can grab ya again.  Even though today's viewing of the film failed to draw me completely into it -- as earlier viewings did -- who knew, but the script's sleuthing down the bad guy got much more of my attention and, hey, this is a nicely written piece.  I salute.  I was engaged for a lot of ""film critic"" reasons, but that was fulfilling too.  If you  have yet to see this film, AND, you're okay with Sci-Fi -- make this your next film.  Hard to believe any Sci-Fi fan would not have already seen this, so if you're a newbie, to encourage you to explore the genre,  I'll also tell you that the love story works, the ending is sweet and multi-layered if somewhat bittersweet.

Best sci-fi movie I have seen in ages. Best ""new to me"" movie I have seen in ages. I know it takes some liberties with certain theory, but that's sci-fi. That's what the genre does. This was just a great movie. It is a shame that when it came out it did not get the advertising push it deserved. ""What it's really smart and well shot? The acting is top-notch and the plot is front and center? But it doesn't have huge fight scenes or a farting dog. How are we supposed to advertise that?! Just put out a couple of trailers and an ad or two on DVDs no one will ever buy. That's good enough.""

The science in it is pretty much rubbish (it's based on the multiverse theory, but it presumes the ability to move one's consciousness/self back and forth across the sheaf of universes which would be impossible even if there were such a thing as ""parabolic calculus"").

Gyllenhaal's performance was the best of his that I've seen.  Vera Farmiga was born for her part.

But Jeffrey Wright never ceases to amaze me.  From the Puerto Rican gangster in the updated ""Shaft"", through the brilliant but unethical (almost psychopathically so) Dr Rutledge in this film,  he never puts a foot wrong.

4496937,4,B004XQO90E,"Source Code
 Finally we have a movie where everything comes together to make an outstanding flick.  In Source Code the move guys deliver a complex, taut, compelling script combined with the best acting from Jake Gyllenhaal that we have seen, perhaps ever, and deft, unobtrusive directing from Ducan Jones in his first big league at bat.  Even the musical score by veteran song master Chris Brown adds to the overall success of the film.  Vera Farmiga plays the love interest so well, in such a warm lovely way that we have no trouble at all falling, along with Gyllenhall, in love with her-in eight minutes.
 Gyllenhaal comes to his senses on a train outside of Chicago, seated across from an attractive woman who he does not recognize.  His last memory is of piloting a helicopter in combat in Afghanistan.  He stumbles around in confusion for eight minutes, the train blows up and then finds himself in a sort of environmental capsule talking to a computer screen.  The screen person explains that he is on a mission to thwart a bomb plot.  He is sent repeatedly back into the situation on the train in eight minute slices of time, each time putting a few clues together to help him find the despicable bomber.  And each time becoming more fascinated with the lovely, warm and irresistible young woman.
 He also begins to put clues together about his own situation.  How did he get from Afghanistan to the environmental capsule?  What is going on with the eight minute long splices of time?  How can he enter and leave time at will?  Will he be able to prevent a dirty bomb from killing millions of people in Chicago?
 Source Code is billed as a Si-Fy thriller and it surely pays off on this level.  It is also a lovely and entertaining love story and works on that level also.  The PG-13 (themes of massive death) film is short but satisfying at one hour and thirty four minutes.  I think this four saw blade film is the best movie I have seen in 2011.  I bet you will like it too.",1443484800,2,1984,4.519662921348314

4496964,4,B004XQO90E,"Let me begin by saying that 4 stars is high for me. Classics like ""Brazil"" or ""Citizen Kane"" or those approaching them get a 5.

That said, I truly enjoyed ""Source Code"". I'm not going to bore you with plot summary, etc., but it was exciting, keeping me guessing both as to plot turns and the philosophical theory backing the process by which it was created as well as the unexpected ramification revealed at the end. As some other reviewers have stated, there was a touch of saccharine then, but who doesn't love a nice bow to tie things up? They did the same thing in ""African Queen"", right?

Acting was beyond reproach, especially the emotionally vacant and self-satisfied program director, as well as the Gyllenhaal's female 'handler' who goes from detached to caring quite convincingly (forgive me, I don't remember the actors' names right now). However, Gyllenhaal's character being a soldier, I felt that he seemed a bit 'soft' in his attitude, especially once his mission became clear. The father/son exchange, however was a nice touch.

P.S. Were you as surprised as I was to find out that Director Duncan Jones is David Bowie's son? Maybe I'm just out of the loop, celebrity-wise.",1441065600,4,1190,4.823529411764706

What a pleasant surprise, to have a movie exceed all your expectations, and then some!  There isn't any one thing I would change about the movie; all elements of it seemed to work to perfection.  The only thing I would advise anyone seeing it for the first time, is to not possibly be put off by the ""Groundhog Day"" type device of the plot early on.  I can remember feeling that way when I first saw ""Groundhog Day"" itself, and we all know how great that movie turned out to be.

TAXATION does enter the picture though, in quite a few ways, some of which are actually part of the movie. It may TAX your ability to suspend disbelief with the many ""Groundhog Day"" restarts of the story. It was emotionally TAXING to observe the good-hearted female soldier empathize with the brave soldier whose last seconds of conscious self awareness are TAXED for a presumably good purpose, but without regard for his well-being. The main scientist running the show did TAX my patience- what a self-absorbed prig he was. Overall a solid 3 out of 5 stars, but the most TAXING experience takes place after the movie is over.",1434153600,,799,4.797101449275362

4497188,4,B004XQO90E,"Describing this film as a blend of Groundhog Day, The Matrix and Quantum Leap (which it mostly is, basically) does not come near to doing justice to this excellent film. Duncan Jones (a.k.a. Zowie Bowie) directs the taut action and handles the time paradox/ parallel reality jiggery-pokery with a Christopher Nolan'esque assuredness with never a dull or sloppy moment, constant action and plenty of the aforementioned jiggery-pokery. Yes, of course the pseudo-science is silly and there are some gaping holes in the logic, but does that matter? No; it's a great rollercoaster of a sci-fi thriller - excellently acted with a twisty-turny plot, lots of action, attention to detail and generally hugely entertaining without the common Hollywood failing for the need to disengage ones higher cognitive functions before it can be enjoyed.",1420934400,,833,5.318181818181818

4497196,2,B004XQO90E,"As other reviewers have noted, this is a kind of ""Groundhog Day meets The Bourne Identity"" and as such, about four minutes into the movie, you'll have worked out precisely everything that's going to happen. It's tedious, silly, incoherent, and not particularly interesting even as lame B-movie style sci-fi.

4497200,5,B004XQO90E,"One of the best SciFi films ever. I just rented it, but will now certainly buy a copy. The dialogue is smart, emotional, realistic, and doesn't insult reason and as noted by another reviewer, is a magnificent blend of ""Ground Hog Day"" and ""Quantum Leap"". Quantum mechanics is far stranger than the film can or would want to portray, yet ""Source Code"" uses the ""Many Worlds"" quantum model to provide a fun foundation for the story line that is plausible enough to be entertaining if necessarily arbitrary in some of the fictional parameters of a future ""science"".

We learn what is going on at the same pace that helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is able to piece  together from what he observes during each 8 minute ""time travel"" mission and the little Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) can afford to take the time to tell him in between each mission - it is a desperate race against time to save Chicago from a devastating terrorist attack. Goodwin is a highly trained quantum physicist who perfectly balances the urgency of saving Chicago and Captain Colter's need to understand his mission - and Vera Farmiga portrays it all with an authentic humanity that should be recognized as truly great acting. Michelle Monaghan plays a sweet and very pretty ""distraction"" that Colter finds more appealing each mission, and she in part provides the motivation to beat the terrorist threat and the quantum limits his handlers think he works under. Captain Stevens slowly burns through his confusion and reluctance to cooperate, grasps the importance of his mission, and achieves a noble, self-sacrificing, believable heroism. Great acting, writing, and direction produce a truly beautiful, very human experience. And I found the ending emotionally satisfying, consistent, and a bit of a surprise. Anything involving quantum physics and time travel will have paradoxes, but that just makes it more fun. And once you get to the ending, it will make you reinterpret many of the scenes. Good fun! Smart.",1419033600,,1996,5.027190332326284

So, I looked it up on wikipedia to try to get a better idea.  Shortly after I looked it up, it started moving along better.  The structure is similar to Vantage Point in that it is the ""same"" story told over and over.  (I'm not a fan of either one.)  It was a sweet movie, and it left an opening for a sequel if they felt the necessity to make one, but it's a complete story on its own.",1417651200,,553,3.892857142857143

4497216,5,B004XQO90E,"Actually, one of the best sci-fi movies in a long time. I have to say that the movie worked as well as it did because of Jake Gyllenhaal. I enjoyed his acting in this immensely. His acting turned a so-so plot into a riveting on the edge of your seat sci-fi thriller. In the end this came out less about the science fiction story and more about the characters. All parts in the movie were pitch perfect. Not one iota of overacting, happens a lot in science fiction; and not a jot of underacting, which also happens in science fiction consistently. This is Class A science fiction and Class A acting all the way. The science fiction part is explained well so that the science fiction aspect is understood. This is important because it makes the completely human ending to the movie more moving and hopeful. I recommend it. You can't lose unless you want to.",1417305600,,855,4.487179487179487

It is not up there with Artificial Intelligence, but it definitely is engaging with a surprise to it that I won't reveal or it would ruin the ending--except for those who are seasoned and inveterate movie watchers or readers who can see the surprise coming.  But there are a couple of twists in the road, so don't be sure you've gotten them all until the end.

4497288,4,B004XQO90E,"I'll get right to my big problem with the film.  Despite being a movie about a bombing, with a bombing taking place almost immediately, it starts off kind of slow and a bit boring.  It does pick up the pace, but you have to be patient and dedicated to seeing this thing through to get to that point.  The premise is pretty interesting, that's for sure.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays U.S. Army Aviation pilot Captain Colter Stevens, who, after being severely wounded in action in Afghanistan, is recruited for a project called ""Source Code"".  On his mission, he is sent to an alternative reality, taking on the appearance of someone who's already there instead of dawning his own visage, and is tasked to learn who planted a bomb on a commuter train in Chicago before this person has a chance to detonate a second, larger bomb somewhere downtown.  Serving as his ""handlers"" in this mission are Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin, played by Vera Farmiga, and scientist Dr. Rutledge, played by Jeffrey Wright.  Only able to enter the alternate reality for eight minutes at a time and always the eight minutes right before the bombing, Stevens find whatever clues he can to the bomber's identity.  But he soon connects with some of the other passengers on the train and desires to do more than just find out who killed all of them.  This movie has one solitary problem that cost it that fifth star...it's pacing (see above.)  Otherwise, it was interesting, mostly suspenseful, and filled up by a great cast.  I do feel stupid for not having realized that Michelle Monaghan is in this film, considering how big a fan of hers I always claim to be.  Oh well, I'll live.  Besides, not realizing is part of the fun.  Like I said, if your patient and willing to sit through this movie, you ultimately will not be disappointed...just bring some chocolate or a caffeinated drink for the first twenty to thirty minutes.  Enjoy.",1404259200,,1906,4.698795180722891
4497289,5,B004XQO90E,Full of twists and turns. I didn't see that one coming is the sentiment we shared at the end of this movie. It was a good thrill ride and has a lot of potential for a sequal. We liked it.,1404172800,,187,3.7

4497295,3,B004XQO90E,Whatever that Je ne sais quois is that some actors have Jake Gyllenhaal has never had it for me. This movie is one of those dj vu affairs in which the same scene get repeated ad infinitum ad nauseum with subtle changes after each go round until one feels one is caught in a revolving door. Fans of Gyllenhaal will see a lot of him; they will also see him blow up real good repeatedly with the train hes riding.

4497314,4,B004XQO90E,"Source Code to me is derivative of many films that came before it. Some have mentioned Groundhog Day and The Matrix as key influences. I was reminded of Jacob's Ladder and The Jacket.

Over and over again we see Jake Gyllenhaal repeat the same 8-minute loop, with the same characters, set, and scenario. A bomb is about to explode on Captain Colter Stevens train. He must do anything he can to diffuse the explosive and find the culprit before they have a chance to set off an even bigger terrorist attack in downtown Chicago.

The U.S. military is behind the scenes spurring Colter on. Everytime he misses his objectives, the bomb detonates and Colter is launched into the same capsule where his military superiors are there to refine his search and launch him back into the same 8-minute loop.

Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the best actors of our generation. His expressions and general mannerisms are so realistic, he always elicits strong emotions on my behalf whenever I watch his movies, starting with his first breakout role in Donnie Darko. Source Code features an older Jake, yet his acting talents are better than ever.",1395532800,,1126,4.793814432989691

4497316,5,B004XQO90E,"You wake up on a train, across from a woman you don't know that calls you a name you don't know, and in five minutes you are dead along with a lot of passengers on two trains. You come to in a room facing a female USAF officer, the room is damp, you are wearing a Army nomex flight suit, and the woman [Vera Farmiga] is asking you questions, a voice says "" he get it,"" and you wake back upon the train,repeat situation, only knowing you have to find someone before, as again, the train blows up. Jake Gyllenhall gives a masterful performance of a modern day Sisyphus, doomed to, it seems, live life for five minutes then die-endlessly. He finally comes to understand he is to find the bomber before the two trains explode, IN THE FUTURE,  but its impossible for anything to happen to change the past. He awakens on the train, goes to the toilet, and sees a face not his, and does start looking. Something tips him, a man leaves he gets off, the train explodes minutes later-back in his body. But something has happened-he has found he maybe change the past. I won't go past this point-the story is just too good and unique. The situation seems impossible, because there is something horrible about him-too.
The plot is great with a sci fi back ground, and lots of action. and the acting is first rate. Do yourself a favor, you won't be disappointed.",1393632000,,1349,4.417670682730924

4497318,4,B004XQO90E,"This is a different sort of movie that compresses ""Groundhog Day"" starting at the same point all the time down to only 8 minutes.
Everything moves so fast and the hero dies in many different ways before he finally gets everything right in his limited time that your head spins with so much information going by so fast, but it is consistent with the hero's confusion as to what is happening to him and makes it easy to be sympathetic to his concerns.  The one concern that I had was that the movie stretched my credibility too far when it broke its own premise of the alternate reality being created in the hero's brain continuing when his physical brain died.  At least they carried forward the ""real"" world into the alternate reality and it was a very satisfying ending.  I'll have to watch it again and see what I missed from the first time I saw it.",1393632000,2,853,4.420382165605096

4497336,4,B004XQO90E,"Thoroughly enjoyed Source Code when we saw it initially and have watching it couple of time on cable.
Was hoping they would have used the ending to create a sequel--if not with Jake's character then with another person humanizing the source code...
Nice that Jeffrey Wrigt was someone with a handicap because that make me consider the fact that his weakness motivated the desire to turn time back and redo mistakes--although it wasn't addressed directly in the movie...

FYI--while this is not strictly a ""new"" idea with movies like Ground Hog Day and others out there about time loops--
Tom Cruise is in movie due to come out in few months called ""End of Tomorrow"" about a Lt Colonel w/no battelfield experience being sent to fight aliens attaching Earth....he too is killed and put into a time loop--doomed to flight and die albeit in longer intervals each time as he and other/female Special Forces office (Emily Blunt) fight to save Earth...
Sounded like this was a real clone of Source Code using several specifics--military fighter, time loop, mission to save the Earth similar to the dometic terrorist in Source Code...
this time he has a direct partner w/Blunt IN the time loop vs Jake's girlfriend who was an unwitting/unknowing partner...

I kept my expectations low, however, because I knew this movie failed to draw huge audiences when it was released.  Much to my surprise, it was quite good and even my parents (who dislike science fiction) enjoyed it! Gyllenhaal pulls off the lead role expertly.  The story moves very fast but there isn't much depth despite the heavy use of advanced technologies (neurological linking and time travel).

Gyllenhaal delivers a powerful performance as the lead character, a soldier turned government operative, again the twist ties into this so I won't say more. The movie lenght is just about right for the story line. I wouldn't pay $30 for this, but if you can pick it up in the $5 - $15 range it will be a good movie at a good price.

The movie is much better than the summary.  This is not one of those films that plods along.  This is face-paced action, time travel and a love story.

But... once the movie gets going there are some simple questions that just flaw the film for me. Such as, how does the bad guy get the bomb on the train and hide it away like he did? It's way too big to carry on without people noticing. Why would the villian leave his nuclear device unattended in a busy parking lot and assume it would be safe/undetected/not stolen etc? Would someone in this position really do that? I doubt it. Finally, when the hero takes over the body of the other person on the train - what happens to that other peron/personality? Do they simply dissolve? If so, for him to go on living using another person's body and essentially kicking them out is basically equivelent to killing them. Is he OK with that? Is he still a hero or now suddenly a murderer? Summary, good idea, but lots of unanswered questions and situations that seem to be not fully thought through.",1372032000,,1107,4.404878048780488

SOURCE CODE has an element that is lacking in too many of the Hollywood CGI sci-fi experimental movies that are so very cloned these day - humanity.

4497390,4,B004XQO90E,"A man wakes up on a train, disoriented and unsure why he's there. A cute woman sitting across from him chats with him while a passerby spills her drink on his shoe. He doesn't quite know what's going on and excuses himself. Things become clearer when he looks in the bathroom mirror and sees another guy's face. Well, sort of clearer. Pretty soon the train explodes, killing him, the cute woman, and everyone else on board. You'd think that would be the end of the movie, but it is only the beginning.

The guy is suddenly in a harness in a dark room. He's suspended in front of several monitors. A woman's voice talks to him, trying to find out what happened, then trying to get him to remember himself. The guy is really Coulter Stevens, a U.S. Army helicopter pilot now works on a secret government project. They've been able to link him to the last memories of a man who died on a Chicago train early that morning. They are using that link to find the bomber, since the bomber has threatened to strike again, and soon. The army scientists send him back to the moment when he wakes up on the train in hopes that he can discover the bomber and his next target.

The premise is intriguing, both the mystery on the train and the whole operation trying to unravel that mystery. The joy of the film is in finding out what is going on, especially with Stevens. The twists in the story are good though some are predictable. The end of the film is suspenseful, but not in the best way. The outcome seems (to me) a little arbitrary. Not that it does not make sense; it could go one of many ways, any of which are just as likely as the others. The movie stuck with me for days thinking about it, but in a very good way. The movie is a solid sci-fi thriller that I would watch again.",1369785600,3,1775,4.279761904761905

This is how the story goes: When decorated soldier Captain Colter Stevens wakes up in the body of an unknown man, he discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train. In an assignment unlike any he's ever known, he learns he's part of a government experiment called the ""Source Code,"" a program that enables him to cross over into another man's identity in the last 8 minutes of his life. With a second, much larger target threatening to kill millions in downtown Chicago, Colter re-lives the incident over and over again, gathering clues each time, until he can solve the mystery of who is behind the bombs and prevent the next attack.

The cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal (as Colter Stevens), Michelle Monaghan (as Christina Warren), Vera Farmiga (as Collen Goodwin) & Jeffrey Wright (as Dr. Rutledge) is excellent. The directing by Duncan Jones (who also directed and wrote the story to ""Moon"" (2009) is excellent. The story & screenplay by Ben Ripley is excellent.

The set decoration by Suzanne Cloutier (who also did the set decoration to ""Taking Lives"" (2004), ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"", ""Lucky Number Slevin"", ""Get Smart"" (2008) & ""Punisher: War Zone"" (2008) is excellent.

Although not as philosophically weighty as Moon this is still an interesting piece, as long as you can suspend disbelief and forget all logic. It's moderately clever and always entertaining. Jones never allows things to spill over into the usual Hollywood blockbuster overkill, and the performances are also suitably controlled and utterly convincing. This is a 90 minute thrill ride with a surprisingly affecting emotional subtext, and it's made all the better by the subtlety and restraint shown by all involved.",1367280000,2,589,5.413043478260869
4497395,4,B004XQO90E,"""An Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge"" was a short story by the famous Ambrose Bierce. In the story, a southern spy in the civil war is to be hanged. The story was featured as an episode on the Twilight Zone if you were around to catch it in 1964. The spy escapes his fate and narrowly escapes numerous times. Unbelievably escapes - and you know what they say about too good to believe. This movie is well written and well acted. Everything in it was almost a mirror image of the Owl Creek story. The soldier can't miraculously escape his fate time after time. Instead he keeps losing his life in a horrific explosion -- or does he.

This is a wonderful movie.  Not only is it visually appealing, but the story line is also we interesting. ""Source Code"" is an ingenious thriller that comes billed as science fiction, although its science is preposterous.  Basically, Jake Gyllenhaal relives this train ride over and over again but each time tries to figure out why the train blew up and who did it.  It's a very interesting story.

As for the quality, this film has impressive color and sound however the sound is far better than the picture.  Hearing distant voices on the train makes you feel like you're really on the train.

Overall, this is a great movie to give as a gift because it has something for both males and females.  I highly recommend this film.",1363305600,4,789,4.625899280575539
4497405,3,B004XQO90E,"I believe that Duncan Jones has read the novels of Franz Kafka (The Castle, The Metamorphosis, The Trial) or has seen the films based on those novels. Kafka wrote his novels in the early 20th century: The Trial was written in 1937. Even then the discoveries in physics, especially quantum theory, were revolutionary, and time travel was a major topic of research.
In both Moon and Source Code the protagonists encounter questions of identity and confusion about whether they are alive or dead (or someone else). The lead actors receive orders from their superiors that are often relayed to them by women, who are always sure of their authority, while the men often end up fighting each other. Like Kafka novels, where the main characters often turn into insects, the Duncan Jones characters often don't know who or where they are.",1363305600,2,830,4.8936170212765955

It is about the tenderness and well-meaning sentiment that I believe is in all of those who fight for our freedom. It also shows us how cold and heartless government agencies can be.

It compares very well with other movies of the same genre because it does not try to go typical Hollywood action flick, therefore making itself immature.  Also, the involvement of a romantic interest into the plot aids in emotional character development.
What I like least about this movie would be the score (but I am being picky).

4497411,5,B004XQO90E,"A young man awakens on a Chicago commuter train, sitting opposite a young woman named Christina, who seems to know him.  The young man is confused.  He believes he is Captain Coulter Stevens, a helicopter pilot for the U.S. Army serving in the Middle East.  When a sudden explosion destroys the train, Stevens wakes up inside a darkened, instrumented metal capsule, listening over a radio to the voice of Air Force Captain Goodwin, who questions him on what just happened.  Stevens' nightmare has just begun...

""Source Code"" borrows a plot device from ""Groundhog Day"" and puts a sci-fy spin on it, repeatedly sending Stevens (Jake Gyllenhall) back to the train.  He learns from Goodwin that he has eight minutes to identify the bomber who sets off the explosion on the train, in order to prevent a worse incident.  In the course of a string of eight minute failures, each different, Stevens begins to form relationships with Goodwin (an excellent Vera Farmiga) and with Christina (Michelle Monaghan), and to ask awkward questions of both.

Director Duncan Jones was wise to minimize the high tech time travel aspects of the story in favor of the relationships that actually drive the movie, and that will determine the uncertain futures of the three main characters.  ""Source Code"" is highly recommended to sci-fy fans.",1361577600,2,1320,4.9908675799086755

This film is a take on the TV show Quantum Leap, but instead of leaping until the issue is solved, the leaper only has 8 minutes to try and solve the problem. Jake Gyllenhaal stars and while I usually don't care for him much, he was excellent here. I have a feeling this character may have been written specifically for him, because he's got a strange style and seems to not fit many of his roles. Source Code is another film in a genre of endless possibilities, it tries really hard to stand out and be special, but sadly it's pretty predictable, while playing off other established material, such as Quantum Leap and The Matrix.

I won't go deep into the story because it does have some stunning twists and turns.

First, the story is unique and interesting; the whole concept of entering someone's body to relive the last 8 minutes of their life is fascinating (If you play video games, it may remind you of the recent ""Driver: San Francisco"".) The story moves at a very fast pace and is thoroughly interesting. It's one of those films that you get lost in and don't bother to check the time. Jake Gyllenhaal gives another brilliant performance, as well as the rest of the cast. The music was also incredible and really stood out to me. The film has some beautiful shots, the explosions are visually stunning. (The Blu-Ray has amazing Picture Quality and Audio Quality.) Aside from the SciFi and Action elements, I felt like some of Colter's actions were really funny, like the restroom scene where he won't stop staring. The ending of the film will leave you with questions and will probably have you anxiously waiting to start it up from the beginning for another viewing.

The basic premise is that Jake Gyllenhaal is a bomber pilot named Colter Stevens who has been recruited for a special mission where he relives the last 8 minutes of a terrorist attack victim's life in order to uncover who the terrorist was and how to prevent it from happening again.  He lives out those 8 minutes and then dies only to be rebooted back at the same spot to relive it again in an attempt to uncover as much information as he can so that they can save as many people as possible.  Once in his new body, Colter forms a quick friendship with Christina, a young woman accompanying his host, but his desire to help himself out of the situation and write his own fate (or be a bigger hero) begins to fray the edges of his mission.

Gyllenhaal carries the film very well, but the entire cast is solid here.  Monaghan is a beauty (stunning, really) and she flirts in all the right angles.  Jeffrey Wright is perfectly creepy in his mysterious role, and Michael Arden slays his character's reveal.  It is Vera Farmiga though who once again solidifies her current status in Hollywood.

4497453,2,B004XQO90E,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 The concept where a particular past juncture in time is re-visited in order to effect a change in future circumstances, was marvelously handled in the brilliant comedy-fantasy, 'Groundhog Day'. 'Source Code' utilizes a similar concept, but here it should basically be subsumed under the genre of Sci-fi Thriller. Unlike 'Groundhog Day', which repeatedly brings a time-tripping Bill Murray back to the past by sleight of hand, 'Source Code' provides a pseudo-scientific rationale, which proves in the end to be decidedly derivative of other time travel tales we've seen before.

Our protagonist, former Army helicopter pilot, Colter Stevens, now severely injured and in a comatose state, is being used as part of a secret US Army project dubbed 'Source Code', to uncover the identity of an individual who bombed a Chicago commuter train, earlier that day. The creator of the project, Dr. Rutledge, and his assistant, Air Force Captain Goodwin, repeatedly keep sending Stevens back eight minutes prior to the bombing inside an experimental device which resembles a space capsule, in order to find out who planted the bomb so they can stop him from detonating an even more destructive dirty bomb in downtown Chicago, which the bomber has promised to do an hour later.

Stevens learns that he's unable to change events in the future reality which Goodwin and Rutledge are a part of, and is only able to be an observer. The Source Code enables Stevens to enter the body of one of the now deceased victims, Sean Fentress, and move about on the train in a parallel universe. While the basic events in each alternate time line are the same (the bomber always plants the bomb in the same place), due to Stevens/Fentress acting differently in each time line, the exact sequence of events is changed. The concept derives from 'Groundhog Day', where the core events end up as variations on a theme. The interactive aspect of the protagonist's abilities, can also be likened to the Star Trek holodeck, where a user is able to interact with a series of images which are mere projections of reality.

One can argue with all the pseudo-scientific explanations but the films' scenarists are basically asking the audience to suspend one's disbelief when it comes to the main premise. For some this is a big problem, but I found other areas of the film to take issue with. One of screenwriter Ben Ripley's big quandaries is how to develop Stevens' character arc in eight minute segments. You'll recall that Bill Murray's 'Phil' character in 'Groundhog Day' was a narcissist who needed to learn an important life's lesson about being a nice guy. He has a whole day (repeated multiple times) to transform himself. Here, we learn virtually nothing about Fentress as his back story is a cypher. When Stevens becomes Fentress, Ripley has him gradually warming up to the film's love interest, Christina Warren, after he acts gruffly toward her when Stevens makes his first 'time trip'. But Stevens/Fentress acts badly at first because Stevens is disoriented not because he has a character defect. So the transformation seems unnecessary and forced since Steven's only real goal is to prevent the bomber from causing further havoc.

Equally less charming are the assorted characters Stevens must deal with on the train and the methods he employs to find out whether they might be the particular villain he's looking for. Again, a comparison to 'Groundhog Day' is instructive. All of the characters Phil interacts with in the Groundhog Day universe, are utterly quirky and charming. Here, they're stereotypical--either obnoxious (bad comedian) or ineffectual (computer geek). What's more, Ripley lacks the imagination to come up with a series of interesting variants. All Stevens/Fentress ends up doing is awkwardly confronting each one of his suspects by ripping the bags they're carrying and spilling the contents on the ground and getting into some kind of physical or verbal confrontation.

Perhaps the biggest clue that 'Source Code' lacks gravitas, is in its choice of a convincing antagonist. Heaven forbid that Mr. Ripley would attempt to create a bad guy rooted in today's headlines. Instead of perhaps an Al Qaeda sympathizer, we're presented with a Mad Bomber of the 1950s dressed up as a modern day disaffected techie. When both the bad guys and the good guys in your movie don't seem very real, the stakes aren't very high and hence the tension on the 'suspense' meter, has got to be very low!

Finally, there's the whole question of a so-called 'twist ending' that doesn't seem to be very surprising at all. Remember, according to the rules of the alternate time line, changing events in a parallel universe, cannot change anything in the present real world. So when Stevens sends the text message to Goodwin that he's stopped the bomber and that the Source Code experiment worked, and Goodwin and Rutledge aren't even aware that any of those events have transpired, that's not the same world we experienced at the beginning of the film. Rather, it's an alternate universe where the 'happy ending' of Sean and Christina walking off into the sunset, is a reality. One other thing that did bother a lot of other people who have posted on the internet, is what happened to Sean once Stevens takes over his consciousness? I guess he's left screaming, inside the mirror!

Back in the real world, the reality of the train bombing remains unchanged. We do wonder, after all those time jumps, did Stevens have enough time to actually communicate the information about the bomber to Rutledge and Goodwin? Couldn't the bomber have easily driven to downtown Chicago and set off his dirty bomb given how much time Stevens was taking with his jumps and inside the capsule?

Source Code looks and feels more like a movie made exclusively for the Syfy channel. It keeps your interest in a basic way but certainly doesn't deserve all the accolades heaped upon it to date.",1340496000,3,5985,4.976

4497456,5,B004XQO90E,"BEWARE:  CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!

While I did enjoy this movie, there were a few plot holes that sort of got to me.

First, the train bomb looked to weigh 200 pounds or more.  Question:  how was the terrorist able to not only haul it onto the train, but to hoist it up and place it above the ceiling tiles in the washroom, without the entire ceiling collapsing?

Second, who was the terrorist?  Oh, yes, the proto-typical, politically correct, loser white guy.  And the motive?  Well, he just didn't like society, so he wanted to destroy the world.  (Give him credit, though, he was able to construct a dirty bomb in his proto-typical, politically correct, loser van.)

Third, time travel.  So the Source Code's side effect is that it acts like a time machine, and re-winds the entire Universe back to the moment when . . . uh . . . when--well, whatever.

Finally, instead of going for the obligatory happy ending, it might have been better if the hero goes back for the last time and kisses the girl as the train is destroyed for the final time.  Instead, what happens?  When the hero goes back for the final time, he basically steals the body, life, and girlfirend of the train passenger who, remember, is no longer dead.  What happened to the train passenger's consciousness?  Perhaps they will make a sequel dealing with his predicament!",1339027200,3,1339,4.653846153846154
4497457,2,B004XQO90E,"*All of my reviews contain spoilers.*

Duncan Jones forever won over my heart with his directorial debut, Moon. As a result, I can forgive and even commend the man for his effort in trying to elevate this banal script. Still, this movie is a failure on nearly every level, save for a couple of flourishes coming specifically from the neophyte director.

Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself part of a mysterious military operation known simply as, ""Source Code."" This program (or something) allows the good Captain's consciousness to inhabit another person's body, as long as that person is of similar body and synapse type (or something.) Captain Stevens is tasked with inhabiting the shell of Sean Fentress, an all-but-anonymous Chicago school teacher who was killed in a bombing of a train on his way to work. Poor bastard. Stevens will live out the last eight minutes of Fentress' life aboard the train, in which he must attempt to find the bomber.

Screenwriter Ben Ripley has a decent premise here, with a somewhat interesting sci-fi plot device peppered in, so it's really rather disappointing that he wastes the opportunity with inane plotting, shallow characters, and embarrassing dialogue. Colter Stevens fails to stop the bomb or find the bomber. Numerous times. That's okay, though, because as it's explained to him, the terrorist event he's forced to relive already took place, and he's merely working in a tangential timeline created by the Source Code program (or something) based off of the dying brainwaves of the recently deceased Mr. Fentress. How Mr. Fentress' brain, or its waves survived the bombing is beyond me, but an astute observer will recognize that at this point, there's absolutely no threat whatsoever. Colter Stevens can continue his Wile E. Coyote act Ad infinitum.

Ripley tries desperately to remedy this tension killer by shamelessly shoehorning a new plot element in the second act. Apparently, the attack on the train was just the beginning, and Mr. Terrorist plans to blow up other parts of Chicago... at some point. We're never really given even a hint of how much time Colter has to find the terrorist, and Ripley is only interested in using this plot device when it's convenient.

In the meantime, we get to explore the creepy burgeoning romance between Stevens/Fentress and his co-worker Christina (Michelle Monaghan.) After spending about ten minutes with her, and witnessing how cool a cucumber she is when somebody spills coffee on her kicks, Stevens inexplicably decides he's in love with her. Why the audience should care is beyond me.

Terrible dialogue is exchanged. Nothing is explained. By the fifth or sixth failure to catch the terrorist, I begin to realize how incompetent Colter Stevens is, and how useless his Commanding Officer Captain Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and the creator of the Source Code... whatever it is, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) are. Neither bothers explaining a thing to poor, inept Captain Stevens, who is obviously not qualified for this task. We're told that Captain Stevens is essentially a stump in reality, and his brain is simply hooked up to the Source Code (or something.) Why the audience should care for his plight is once again beyond me. Up to this point, his behavior has been far from endearing. Cap Stevens tells his superiors to unplug him and let him die after his mission is complete. They comply. I yawn and wonder how long it would have taken a Chicago area detective to solve this mystery and catch the terrorist.

Fortunately for those watching this tripe, Duncan Jones isn't particularly interested in much of it. He's much more interested in exploring what Source Code is, what the implications are, and of course establishing an overall tone an atmosphere that's altogether quite appealing, which is really no surprise coming off of Moon. Jones all but gives away who the terrorist is in the opening minutes of the film, which allows him to focus the central mystery instead on what exactly is happening with Colter Stevens. Unfortunately, not even Duncan's touches can help the bulk of this train wreck of a screenplay, which simply didn't allow for it. One can see plainly what kind of film Duncan could have made out of this premise, had he written the script himself instead of merely trying to put band-aids on it. What we're left with is a rather boring, run of the mill thriller, with the requisite love story tacked on for good measure, with only mere flashes of an interesting, thought provoking science fiction story telling.

Of course, Colter Stevens is able to find the bomber, and convince Captain Goodwin to send him back one more time, so that his consciousness can live on in Sean Fentress' body and continue his flimsy romance with Christina. What's funny is that I've heard over and over again that this is a happy ending, and that the film actually suffers for it. I'm not sure how this is possible.

The film establishes that Stevens is living the last eight minutes of Fentress' life in a tangential timeline, which is how he's able to continue existing happily ever after at the end. What this means is that Colter Stevens essentially killed Sean Fentress so that his consciousness could inhabit Fentress' body and continue living as a normal, intact human being. What's more, he manipulates Christina, who explicitly states she had feelings for whoever Fentress was before Colter's invasion. She thinks she's finally gotten her man, but that isn't true at all. So, for those keeping score, this film ends with our hero essentially willingly killing another man in a tangential universe, just so he can continue to live a happy existence with a woman who's really in love with the original Fentress.

Oh, and all of those times Colter failed to stop the bomber? Well, all of those tangential timelines had to have continued on, which means that the terrorist was most likely allowed to carry out his plot unencumbered numerous times; killing God knows how many people in the process.

It's a pretty decidedly dark moral and ethical note to end the film on, and Duncan Jones should be applauded for lending the script the narrative threads needed to get there, and for having the stones to pull it off. The ending of the film, and trying to figure out what the hell Jeffrey Wright was doing with his character, are the only things worth thinking about when the credits begin to roll.

The acting in this film is categorically awful across the board. Jake Gyllenhaal is no leading man, and here he seems to be trying to reach Nicholas Cage levels of ridiculous. His facial expressions are hilarious in this picture. I generally like Michelle Monaghan, but she's given absolutely nothing to do here, except spit out pitiful dialogue, stare doe-eyed at Jake, and be the typical female object most films reduce the female lead to. The film would have been better served ditching the love story altogether. I'm fairly certain Vera Farmiga was on some sort of sedative during principal photography. The aforementioned Jeffrey Wright goes completely off the rails here, playing the role of mad scientist at about a 15 when the story really only calls for a level no higher than 7. Wright's performance here is all-time bad. In all honesty, it's probably worth sitting through the entirety of this insipid movie just for the ten minutes or so of screen time Wright gets, that's how preciously crappy it is. We're talking Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls levels of suck, here.

Photographically, the film is beautiful, which is to be expected from Jones. The guy is a gifted craftsman, and shot for shot this film oozes style on a Ridley Scott-esque level. I also can't help but love all of the different small moments he explicitly added to the film, such as the reveal of how Stevens communicates with his commanding officers, and the aforementioned ending. If only there were more of those moments sprinkled throughout.

Somehow, this film has been well recieved by both critics and audiences, which means that an incredibly creative Duncan Jones will get to keep making movies with studio money behind them. For that reason alone, I suppose I'm grateful for this films existence.

4497458,4,B004XQO90E,"From the same director as Moon, this is a great little compact science fiction movie. Set in modern day but using fantasy science as its gimick, the film takes an Army pilot played by Jake Gyllenhaal and sends him into a momentary world composed of a slice of memory from the victim of a train explosion, in an effort to figure out why the train exploded. The tech is complicated but explained throughout the course of the film well enough to not get in the way of the storyline and the whole is character based. Thankfully, the cast is uniformly great, with Michelle Monaghan (Mission Impossible) as the requisite pretty girl, doing a great job of being more than just a face. Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright also turn in great performances and overall, director Duncan Jones has made another tidy self-contained movie driven by character. The complexity of the science gets a little knotty toward the end but that's the only real flaw and the only reason I didn't give it five stars for intelligent construction and pure enjoyment.

I'm referring to the freeze-frame scene near the end of the movie when the camera slowly zooms out from ""the kiss"" to pan across the frozen-in-time faces of other passengers on the previously doomed train of death. Aside from my curiosity as to how technologically this shot was realized, there was a much deeper fascination that appealed to me. Here were the smiling faces of individual personalities rescued from an alternate reality where they smiled no more as the ashes from their fading faces fell to the floor. I immediately began to reflect on the many thousands of souls whose mortal bodies were unjustly destroyed on September 11, 2001 and then I began to forget about the total number reported (a cold statistic) and I began to imagine what it would be like to have really known each and every person prematurely released from this world on 9/11...appreciating the subtle intricacies of each man and woman and child (including future projections of the unborn ones from expectant mothers who were snuffed out before they even had a chance to see their babies take their first breath)...taking the time to clearly focus on each one of them as a unique (one-of-a-kind) child of God just as the glass lens in the scene from this film took its time to allow that same kind of visual perception of each person to slowly sink in. And it's worth mentioning here that there was also some dialogue about LIFE near this scene that helped lead this train of thought to wherever it was going. Life. Death. Life Again. I mentioned God already. He was in there somewhere...inside these thoughts of mine. I'm not sure what He was saying. But I think perhaps He wanted me to know that this is what their smiling faces look like to Him when He puts them all back together again on the other side.

4497467,4,B004XQO90E,"On the surface, the trailers for Source Code give you the impression of an action film dealing with themes that have been done before in other sci-fi - and fantasy - films and shows like Groundhog Day, Quantum Leap, Frequency, The Matrix and others. And while Source Code does involve ideas that have already been done, it does it in ways that raise it head and shoulders above most films in the genre, mainly in the way its characters react to the situation they find themselves in, and in the extremely fine performances given by Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright and a host of others. You believe in their characters, and because of that, you believe the situation they're in and you come to care about them.

I have to be careful not to give anything away because a lot of Source Code comes in a series of revelations, so I'll limit the set-up to what you can see in the trailers. The film begins with a man named Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) suddenly waking up on a train, not seeming to know where he is. His confusion only increases when he finds a woman sitting across from him, Christina (Monaghan), thinks he is someone else, a friend of hers named Sean Fentress. Disoriented, Stevens makes his way to the bathroom, only to find his reflection in the mirror is that of Fentress, whose ID he finds in his wallet. His immediate confusion comes to an abrupt end moments later when the train is ripped apart by a bomb, killing him and everyone on board.

Or so it would seem, until he wakes up again, this time in some kind of military-esque environment pod, where we learn that Stevens is an Army helicopter pilot and his last memory, prior to waking up on the train, was being shot down while on a mission in Afghanistan. On a computer screen in the pod, a female Air Force officer, Captain Goodwin (Farmiga), begins talking Stevens out of his confusion. Stevens learns that he's part of a program called Beleagured Castle, and that he's being used to try and stop a terrorist who, having blown up the train, is planning on detonating a 'dirty' nuclear device in downtown Chicago in a matter of hours. The scientist behind Beleagured Castle, Dr. Rutledge (Wright), has devised a technique involving quantum physics which allows them to create a ""source code"" version of the train bombing and to insert Stevens into the body of Fentress, a passenger on the doomed train, eight minutes before the bomb goes off. And they have to keep inserting Stevens back in again and again with the mission of finding the bomb and, more importantly, finding out the identity of the bomber behind it, before the threatened detonation of the nuclear device is carried out.

A love interest unsurprisingly develops between Stevens and Christina, but it's handled in a way that you can actually believe it. But for me, the most moving parts of the film are the interactions between Stevens and his military handler, Goodwin. Gyllenhaal and Farmiga give outstanding performances as a soldier trying desperately to understand what is happening to him and the sympathetic officer who is in the difficult position of keeping him focused on the mission while knowingly withholding information from him that could jeapordize his ability to complete it.

A lot of talent went into Source Code and it shows. The director, Duncan Jones (this is his second film after the highly regarded Moon) gets the pacing just right, instinctively knowing when to speed things up, when to slow them down, and how to let things unfold, always keeping you engaged with the characters. The writer, Ben Ripley, makes his first real mark here in giving Source Code's characters a level of human depth and believability that most films of the genre lack. Ripley gives the sci-fi aspects their due, but knows that the heart of any film is in the characters and in how the audience connects with them. And the evocative musical score by Chris Bacon is deftly done, adding to the mood of a scene while never overwhelming or distracting from what's happening.

Note: a nice nod in the film to the TV show Quantum Leap was the choice of Scott Bakula, who played Sam Beckett, as the voice of Stevens' father.

Some few people can go back in time to the last eight minutes of another's life. Unfortunately, that includes the event that ended it, so it's hardly a pleasure cruise. Much to no one's surprise, the military takes this technology on as a counter-terrorism tool. It's too late to avert the disaster that already happened, but maybe it contains clues that will help prevent a bigger one. Eight minutes is hardly enough to get started, so Colter Stevens has to take the trip again and again, learning a little more each time, and dying again each time.

The action plays well, and plays a little differently in each eight-minute trip (so he can make progress against the terrorist), right to the very end - which contains a pleasant flip. On the whole, this action movie acquits itself much better than lots I can name.

So, what's my beef? The name. Obviously, some Lala-lander heard this cool techie term ""source code"". He didn't understand what it meant, so assumed that it had no meaning - leaving him free to make one up. I could do that too. Let's let the word ""scriptwriter"" refer to a South American turnip, and ""director"" be a children's playground toy. See how well that works? Heck, even a movie like Gattaca had the decency to create a new word when they created a new meaning. Outside that one bit of ridiculosity, I really did enjoy this one.

4497475,5,B004XQO90E,"A man (Jake Gylenhaal) wakens in a Chicago bound train sitting across from an attractive woman who appears to know him. She calls him ""Sean"" while he believes his name is ""Colter"". When he sees his face in the mirror it is not his own. After 8 minutes an explosion rips the train apart and Colter awakens again to find himself in a command capsule talking to a female airforce officer through a console. She tells him Sean has been killed in the explosion earlier in the day along with everyone else on the train. A programme called ""source code"" allows them to transport Colter into the last 8 minutes of Sean's mind. In that time Colter must identify who the bomber is to prevent an even worse atrocity occuring later in the day. So Colter must again and again return to this same eight minutes until his mission is complete.

All films require suspension of disbelief, this one more than most, messing with your mind, quantum physics, time and the idea of self all in one short snappy movie. However suspension of disbelief is repaid with an exhilarating and surprisingly moving thriller, with great performances from the four leads, including Jeffery Wright as a man induced to casual cruelty by his belief in the overwhelming moral importance of what he does, and Michelle Monaghan, who, with this, adds to her cv another unshowy, elegant and hugely attractive performance from relatively (and in this case necessarily) limited material.

There are many interesting and important philosophical and scientific questions raised in this film. But try not to think too much about the answers presented: behind them lie many gaping plot holes. Instead just go with the flow for one of the most entertaining and engaging thrillers in years.",1327795200,2,1739,4.851851851851852

It seems  to be that people's memories persist for 8 minutes after death, and the federales have a computer program that gloms onto these memories and can then insert Jake into them, where he can carry out tasks not performed by the original owner of the memories.  How a remote computer collects memories from a specific dead individual and inserts someone into them is not dealt with.  Then it turns out that Jake himself is a GI returned from battle in a mostly dead state so that when his usefulness to the computer program ends, so does he.

The story begins with a view of the Chicago waterfront. One man rides a train; he seems stunned and unaware of himself. A double-decker train carries commuters to Chicago. There is an explosion outside! Next there is a strange event where he is questioned. ""Who bombed the train?"" We return to the train. More strange behavior. He searches a restroom and finds a strange machine. He warns the crew. There is an explosion. Is it real? Is it confusing? ""This makes no sense."" Who is the bomber? Quiet and withdrawn? ""Anything strange on the train?"" [The actors in this story?] He gets off the train to follow a man. Motion sickness? There is a fight, a man falls on the tracks. Then we see more strange events. Who is controlling things? We finally learn of the reason for this exercise: a terrorist will explode a ""dirty bomb"" in Chicago!

His next assignment is to find the conducter's room. He fails in this. ""Everything is going to be OK."" The scenes repeat. The man acts strange. He borrows a phone from a lady. There is another change of scenery. ""Am I dead?"" Is he imagining all this? His controllers speak to him. Can he find the bomber? ""Send me back in."" He finds the bomb with its cell phone activator. Did he find the bomber? ""Sorry."" He follows another man. Will he lose him? ""I know its you."" There is a surprise in the trunk. The man explains his actions. ""There has to be rubble."" He now has the bomber's name. He has a last request. The SWAT team gets the driver. A job well done. The story runs on. Will his mission be terminated? ""Thank you for your service. Good luck!"" So now the story repeats again. Shawn disarms the bomb.

Will they clear his memory? He stops Derek Frost. ""It's over."" He makes a phone call. Then another to a dead soldier's father. ""Are you OK?"" There is conversation among the passengers. They are not friendly. Shawn makes a bet with a man; can he make the other passengers laugh? The red button is pushed. We see the body! ""It is a beautiful morning in Chicago."" ""Do you believe in fate?"" ""So what do you want to do today?"" Goodwin gets a text message on her phone. ""Tell him everything will be OK.""

This is a very strange story that repeats itself over and over (to create padding and make it appear that something is happening). Not recommended.

The viewer needs to be able to suspend what they know and allow themselves to go along for the ride.  One thing about the story that I kept thinking was how I would do this differently, but then I realized that the character had emotional issues of his own to deal with.  The progression of events demonstrates a rather typical bias against the military and the belief that they will always consider things in terms of ""acceptable losses.""  Still, in this movie the big, bad military supervisors are dealt with rather elegantly by an underling that won't follow orders.  The result is somewhat shocking on the one hand, and somewhat predictable on the other.

We all know its fake but put that aside for the short time they've asked for our attention. In this latest Jake Gyllenhaal film, that agreement is stretched to its absolute limit and for some, beyond.

  Gyllenhaal plays army captain Colter Stevens who's suddenly found himself on a train across from woman who keeps referring to him by another name. Additionally, she's talking to him as if she knows him. After a relatively short time the train meets with a catastrophe and Stevens is in a confined area staring up at a monitor being asked to explain the events. Still struggling with memory issues, he's given the assignment, ""find the perpetrator"", and returned to the same situation. This series of events occurs several times in a way that would more likely remind many viewers of Vantage Point, assuming there are many people who saw it. That said, it isn't intent on inspiring a debate on the time traveler's paradox or parallel universes.

4497489,5,B004XQO90E,"If you watch this movie, and I think you should, don't get too invested in how the scientific premise is explained as the movie unfolds, because that is the one weak part of the movie.

But the rest is a delight.  It's tightly paced, very well acted (and I am not a big Jake G fan), and oscillates between a completely grounded in the here and now of today scenes on a Chicago Metro train versus the otherworldly place that Jake's character finds himself after each episode on a train.  The two female characters are really well drawn and performed and I thought both actresses did a great job.

The film is slightly reminiscent of Invasion of the Body Snatchers because the last ten minutes turns positive in tone when a sad ending would perhaps have been more appropriate.  I think for the writer and director, this is a coin flip decision, and they made a choice that works.  It would have been interesting for them to add an alternate, darker ending as an extra.

The development of Jake Gyllenhaal's character is remarkable and whoever is responsible for the little details about his character should be commended.  For example, the character's fingernails becoming dirty as the story goes - who would have thought of that?  [The only character that was played stereotypically in my opinion, was the boss.  I don't know of any brilliant computer geek who is that ruthless.]

AND the way they portrayed Chicago is absolutely beautiful.  Many movies/tv shows set in a generic large city (usually Chicago but sometimes they don't say it, will have stock footage of the buildings and skyline - but sometimes they are outdated).  In this particular movie, they had the outdoor shots set in the present Chicago - with new landmarks like the Bean (Cloud Gate) and Trump Tower among others, well-featured.  The aerial shots of the city, showcasing its architecture and the general cleanliness of the city ... are gorgeous and quite frankly, fresh looking.

I'm not sure how many times I will watch it because there is so much repetition within the plot, and that get's a bit tedious.

This film is not for the overly anxious or easily irritated, which I tend to be.  The only reason I could watch this, was because of Jake.  Had it been Cruise, Reeves, or some other big name, I might have skipped it.  But I could overlook the tediousness because of that beautiful face.

The blu-ray is nice, of course, but it irks me that one cannot stop the film without returning to where one left.  I can only pause and quickly have a break before my quirky blu-ray player automatically shuts down.  I'm sure that's an equipment issue.

The timespan covered by the movie is only a day, in fact focusing on only a few minutes of that day, and only a handful of people are involved, yet the movie is able to deftly explore a lot of important themes from a lot of angles via that small slice of life.  The acting is also very good, with nothing being overdone.  True, the alleged quantum physics used to make the plot possible is almost all nonsensical mumbo jumbo, but that's OK because the wise viewer will inherently be inclined to push the nonsense to the periphery and just run with the story.  Here are a few of the themes that stood out for me:

- Life is ""nonlinearly sensitive"" in the sense that the smallest events can result in an entirely different life trajectory (the well-known ""butterfly effect"").

- Superficial judgments of people often turn out to be completely wrong.

- Life can end unexpectedly, so don't squander the time you have.  Make every day count.

- Don't forget to tell the people you love that you love them.  Before it's too late ...

- There may be some form of afterlife, but it could be quite different than what we imagine.

4497502,4,B004XQO90E,"SPOILER CODE: There is no time travel.

I ascribe to that theory for my current modern conspiracy Delta Green role-playing campaign, and so does Source Code.  The premise is simple, if considerably underused in science fiction.  Source Code seeks to correct that imbalance. Like Donnie Darko, Source Code posits that perception is reality. There's no such thing as one time stream, but rather multiple streams formed every time a decision is made.

Source Code uses this many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to fight the war on terror. Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is co-opted to investigate a terrorist attack on a train in Chicago. He jumps into the body of Sean Fentress, a school teacher, who is traveling with his attractive but platonic companion Christina Warren (adorable Michelle Monaghan).  It doesn't end well.

Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) soon dispels Stevens' confusion: he has eight minutes to go back into the Source Code, a snapshot of reality that's basically a highly interactive video game.  Time is of the essence, so Stevens is sent back into the Source Code again and again to find the bomb and the identity of the terrorist, his reservations notwithstanding. It's about this time that Source Code starts to strain under the weight of its plot.

Stripped to its basics, Source Code is basically a two-person play about relationships, one in person (Stevens/Warren) and the other long-distance (Stevens/Goodwin).  The camera pulls in tight on Gyllenhall and Farmiga as they engage in alternately pained, exasperated, frustrated, and flirty conversations.  It pulls out to appreciate Monaghan's loveliness and Gyllenhall's handsome profile.  This is an actor's movie.

It's also a Duncan Jones film, who is fast becoming a modern-day Phillip K. Dick as he tackles questions of self in his films. Like Moon, Source Code is as much about the definition of reality as it advances the plot.

Which is perhaps why the resolution isn't particularly compelling.  Source Code studiously avoids any hint of political controversy by having a bland villain with little motivation. It telegraphs its plot twists. And its ending is a little too neat for my tastes.  But then, Source Code is more interested in poking your brain than tugging your heart strings.  Jones' primary goal seems to be focused on getting the audience to view time travel differently, and in that regard Source Code is a resounding success.

I thought Jake Gyllenhaal did a good job as a soldier tasked with identifying a terrorist by reliving the last eight minutes of someone's life over and over.

This is science fiction mixed with ideas of time & space. The confined space of a commuter train and the machine Gyllenhaal's character sits in helps create some of the atmosphere of tension and deep threat.

I thought this movie went very fast. It felt like I was watching an episode of television instead of a feature film simply because of how quick it was over.

I didn't connect with the romance forced into the plot nor did I empathize with the whole father-son dynamic either. This film was all about the science behind the plot. Nevermind the characters.

In this modern day sci-fi thriller, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a helicopter pilot shot down in Afghanistan; but he seems in a confusing state of mind.  In reality, scientific/medical technology has tapped into what is left of his brain (not much body left).  He is being used to travel back in time for 8 minute stretches.  He appears on a commuter train in Chicago just before a bomb goes off and kills everyone on board.  His mission is to stop it.  It takes him several attempts in consecutive 8 minute time frames.  Generally I'm not much for this ""Groundhog Day"" style of filmmaking but here Jones manages to change the environment enough that the story remains interesting.  Mid-movie the film becomes a traditional thriller as Colter (Jake G.) gets ever closer to the terrorist.  The ending is a bit of a cop-out, directed at mainstream filmgoers.  Some will hate it.

4497510,4,B004XQO90E,"Duncan Jones' ""Source Code"" is a taut sci-fi thriller, of which intriguing premise may remind us of a 1993 movie ""Groundhog Day."" Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, a military helicopter pilot, who is given a near impossible task to find out the terrorist responsible for the recent train bombing in Chicago.

Assuming the identity of a victim on the doomed train, Colter is sent back to ""relive"" the eight minutes before the bomb goes off. Like Bill Murray's hapless protagonist, Colter is forced to live the same eight minutes again and again by Jenkins (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), who are desperate to know who the terrorist is.

Despite the time-loop concept the entire film is based on, director Duncan Jones employs a simple narrative style to focus the characters and their interactions. The result is a surprisingly emotional conclusion (like Jones' previous thriller ""Moon""), in which the protagonist Colter has to face the inevitable.

As an action thriller ""Source Code"" is fast-paced and slick, but perhaps some viewers might feel the idea of reliving the same eight minutes is underdeveloped.

I tried to make guesses and my mind came up with something totally different. And I'm sure Jake didn't want to know either.

4497514,3,B004XQO90E,"This combo genre of action adventure melded to sci fi is popular at the box office. I think I prefer it when the film is solidly one or the other. It is VERY plot driven. The main character, a captain with possibly a sci fi fleet, keeps repeating the same event over and over involving a train which is blown up by a mad bomber.  Jake G plays the captain and he is quite good. He carries the whole movie, virtually every frame.

This reminds me of the German film RUN LOLA RUN by Tom Twyker. He had Lola repeating the same event again and again with the end result of her ending up dead or her boyfriend or both.  She keeps redoing the sequence of events so that she can get them to both live. However, there is no ""state"" or army involved, no bombing event and no controlling force.  We never know what caused Lola to live this sequence again and again.  That was a 5 star film for me but Twyker did it first.  If you liked this movie, you will love the Twyker one.

Source Code is a tense, enthralling, and thrilling ride!! You the viewer are trying to figure out who the mad bomber is (Hint: It's not the stereotypical terrorist - he's something like Timothy McVeigh). Everytime that Colter Stevens is transported back on the train you are hoping that he can find the bomb, the terrorist, and Save the people. When they showed what Colter Stevens actually looks like hooked up to the Source Code, I immediately thought of Robocop. The same thing that happened to Murphy (death) happened to Stevens. Then the train sequence repeats, but it's *Different* each time that Stevens goes on his mission.

However, if you are this type of person, you will see through the plot within the first couple of minutes and hope something surprising happens. It doesn't. The plot feels quickly thrown together, hardly thought out, and Jake Gyllenhaal, who I think can be a great actor, is boring in this movie. I loved him in Love and Other Drugs and thought he was good in Brothers, but he's a very static character here. The movie could have been great, but it fell incredibly short.

It's a decent enough film although not quite the tour-de-force I was hoping for from ""Moon"" director Duncan Jones's second feature. Gyllenhaal makes a nicely tweaked lead in the Bruce-Willis-in-12 Monkeys tradition but the rest of the cast - with the exception of Vera Farmiga and a criminally underused Jeffrey Wright - are fairly forgettable.

Definitely a case of ""Close but no Cigar""; unfortunately not quite the classic it could have been with a little more polish.",1317168000,5,853,5.085714285714285

Each time he learns a little more, but we are not really sure where he is in 'real time' and where it is he is visiting (and I can't reveal too much without spoiling the film.) Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance, a fine balance of pathos, anger, fear, and frustration. The supporting cast of Michelle Monaghan (as a woman on the train) and Vera Farmiga (as a military officer involved in the simulation/time travel) are both excellent as well.

The action was filmed wonderfully, and the story kept me intrigued. My only complaints, and the reason for the 4-star rating, is that the film dragged at parts, when the Jake G. character returned to the train over and over. It's a difficult scenario to pull off - forcing the viewer to watch the same scene over and over, or at least parts of it - and I felt it did get old. Also, I was still slightly baffled about certain aspects of the plot at the end - as to what the 'source code' exactly was - I felt it needed to be fleshed out a little bit more.

Through a loosely-explained implementation of cutting edge technology, they're able to insert an unwitting agent into the near past, where he then relives the eight minutes immediately preceding a terrorist attack over and over again, desperately seeking suspects and answers. I'm typically a big fan of this style of high-concept science fiction flicks, and for the great majority of its running time, Source Code manages to continuously one-up itself in that respect. The film doesn't shy away from delivering powerful, surprising answers as events play themselves out, while a deep, complex script ensures there's always a new mystery to pick up where the last one left off. With that nice juicy carrot always dangling just out of reach and a breakneck pace from start to finish, this plays more like an intense, brilliant short film and not the feature-length offering it actually is. Though an awkward, mismatched happy ending does sour things to a certain extent, the sharp curves it navigates before running into that brick wall won't easily be forgotten.",1316736000,,1159,5.170212765957447

The actors are likable, the pace is reasonably fast and the ending is pretty uplifting for a ""brain in a jar"" movie.  Originality?  I kept thinking of what happened to Captain Pike at the end of the Star Trek TV episode.  But that's ok.

I should also mention that even on my ancient tube television the opening shots of Chicago are just friggin spectacular.  I'm guessing this has to do with the use of a Red camera about which I know little except that it's state of the art.

I always feel bad when a movie does not really work, because I know how hard it is to be creative and keep coming up with ideas.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays the soldier choosen because of special circumstances to go back in time, and in only eight minutes, find the the bomb and who planted it.

The plot line resembles Ground Hog Day, one of my favorite movies, where the soldier must learn from his previous mistakes, until finally he completes his task and is allowed to stop going back in time.  Source Code gives us more science to go with, than Ground Hog, which makes it quite believeable.  The acting by Gyllenhaal is outstanding.  We see him go from a scared and confused man, to one who grasps his environment enough to learn to control it.  Vera Farmiga, who plays his communications link during the experiment, shows her conflicted emotions with the greatest of subtley, a real joy to watch.

Lots of suspense, and lots for your brain to chew on, which is what I love about science fiction.  Are we traveling towards this new reality as delve into the mystery of quantum physics?  Do the decisions we don't act on played out on some cosmic stage in another reality?

4497556,4,B004XQO90E,"What can you accomplish in the final eight minutes of your life? Can you save the day? Maybe prevent a bomb from detonating on a train? And if not that, can you reconcile with your estranged family? Or kiss the girl you just fell in love with? SOURCE CODE is a sci-fi thriller, and it's got its clever on. Running at a no-nonsense 94 minutes, it's spare and efficient and that's partly why it works. It drives up that sense of immediacy.

If, during the first fifteen minutes or so (or even deeper in), you've become all baffled, then that means the plot's got you where it wants you. This is one of them films that drops a big reveal every few minutes. It helps that our reluctant protagonist is in the same state of bewilderment. 17th Airborne helicopter pilot, Army Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) suddenly finds himself on a Chicago commuter train seated opposite a lovely co-passenger chatting him up familiarly. Not too long after he glances at a mirror and sees someone else's face gazing back at him. And eight minutes after he'd first come to, the train explodes, killing everyone onboard, including him, false face and all.

Colter Stevens now finds himself holed up in a sort of containment pod in some nebulous Army lab. A scientist informs him of the tragic train bombing which had happened earlier that day. She mentions experimental technology which would allow his consciousness to be projected onto the last eight minutes of the memories of one of the victims. Except that Colter Stevens would be able to act and therefore alter those memories. It's not really time travel, but for brevity's sake and because it's a sexier label, let's stick with that. Colter's mission is to locate the explosive device on the train and unearth the bomber... in eight minutes' time. You can see why the guy would need to be sent back time and again. With each reinsertion, with each new variation on how these eight minutes play out, Colter gets that much closer to piecing the puzzle together. And, somewhere along the way, he falls in love with that lovely co-passenger. And since she's being played by Michelle Monaghan who simply has this way about her, it's understandable.

Operation Beleaguered Castle is the experimental program what's guinea-pigging Colter Stevens, and this venture just may end up saving countless lives, except that there's such a dehumanizing element involved. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a strong, wired performance as our hero purposely kept in the dark for a huge chunk of the film. He's strongly advised to not dig into his own recent past. Our guy demonstrates his ornery streak.

Obviously, given the premise, there are bits of parallelism with films like GROUNDHOG DAY, 12:01, and DEJA VU, and if you're a fan of time travel (although, again, this isn't really time travel), you'll lap up what unfolds on the screen. Even if, in spots, you're rendered bewildered and perplexed and confounded (but having tremendous fun, all the same). I will say that I do agree with some of them other folks what said SOURCE CODE should've ended with the freeze frame sequence. That would've carried a more potent and poignant statement. Instead, the film trots out several codas too many, opts for a more conventional and rather chickensh_- ending. But that's my only bugaboo. This is a ripper of a movie, thrilling and surprising and smart and mostly full of good choices. And they're playing me for a sucker but I can't help but be amused each time Jake Gyllenhaal's character is told ""Everything's gonna be okay."" And then the train explodes, unfailingly.",1314316800,,3586,4.854575163398692

4497559,4,B004XQO90E,"Source Code is a Sci Fi Thriller with an Inceptionish premise.  A US soldier(Jake Gyllenhaal) is trapped in a capsule of some kind and is being sent to an alternate past over and over again where he awakes on a train and keeps repeating the same sequence of events on an 8 minute duration.  After these 8 minutes have passed, all of a sudden a bomb explodes killing everyone on the train, and he returns to his capsule.  The soldier is informed little by little about why he is there and what the point of all this is.  He is dead and exists in a strange new technology called ""Source Code"" and the military is using him to find out who was the bomber on the train.

  A:  First of all, I can't believe how many people gave this movie a favorable rating.  I'll just leave it at that.
  B:  Second of all, this movie suffers on several fundamental fronts.  The acting... well, it's just lame.  The portrayals were uniformly stiff and unconvincing.  It was just very boring watching these people act their roles.  And then... the story itself was convoluted / unrealistic / dumb etc...

2.  Thus, when you have terrible acting and a more lame / convoluted plot line=a complete dud of a movie.

3.  By the way, another piece of evidence that this movie is a complete dud:  it's on amazon prime streaming.  Look I love amazon and I'm a prime member, but there's a reason certain recent movies make it to prime streaming; ie no one is willing to pay to watch it etc...",1313625600,5,847,4.533333333333333
4497567,5,B004XQO90E,"This is a hit movie and establishes Duncan Jones in the mainstream. It may take him along the path of Nolan,but I think Jones has a greater propensity to delineate human emotions. Pop-corn sci-fi,Source Code carries off its absurdity lightly and stylishly. Jones is a spellbinding storyteller and doesn't bog his film down with long explanations or pretentious metaphysics(as in Nolan).""Source Code"" is a military computer programme that allows an agent to pass into another man's brain in the last 8 minutes of his life. Science fiction is fiction based on an idea of science and Jones focusses on story and characters and idea without gratuitious special effects.

Captain Colter Stevens(Gyllenhaal),on a mission,is sent back in time to this train bound to Chicago,and into the body of ""Sean"" a schoolteacher commuter:he is disorientated,opposite him sits a beautiful woman,Christina(Monaghan),who appears to know him. His job is to locate a bomb on board and hopefully the man who planted it. In doing so he can prevent a bigger bomb within Chicago. The train soon blows up. He awakes in a low tech capsule where he learns via a computer screen that an agent called Goodwin(Farmiga)is in charge of him,and a mysterious Dr Rutledge in the background,who created Source Code. Stevens has to repeatedly live the last 8 minutes of the teacher's life to find the villain. As he returns again and again to those fateful eight minutes, Colter finds that he can remember his previous visits, even though for Christina and others on the train, they are of course happening for the first time (as in Groundhog Day). As the conscious occupant of this borrowed body, he apparently possesses free will and need not duplicate exactly what the original memory donor did. This involves thepossibility that he could relive the memories of a man's final eight minutes and act in such a way as to affect the outcome.

Due to the insecurity of his situation and the pressing nature of the time allowed,Gyllenhaal enacts the role of a hapless innocent from cluelessness to unwavering resolve with which he aims to transcend the ultimate purpose of his mission with romantic asides and comedic missteps,brilliantly..Ripley's screenplay slowly unveiling twists that deepen our understanding of the situation and draw us closer to the hero. Stevens,however, will also pursue his own agenda: to find out how he came to be part of this experimental programme; to contact the father from whom he had departed on bad terms for a tour of duty in Afghanistan; and to save Christine, the other passengers,and the world. Stephens must also grapple with the question of whether it is possible to divert your life from the terminus towards which it seems - inevitably and uncontrollably - to be hurtling. My criticism is that the film went on too long and should have frozen when time froze during the kiss,signifying what was the death of Colter. By the end he had created a parallel universe,which implies for each trip back in time he has probably created a different dimension and reality,separate from his originating time/dimension.",1313625600,2,3107,5.05458089668616
4497568,4,B004XQO90E,"In hit television show ""The X-Files"" there is an episode titled ""Monday"". It's about a day that keeps happening over and over again, only differing in the small details of the day. In the end Mulder and Scully, (the stars of the show) end up dieing in a bank, due to a bomb explosion.

The plot of ""Source Code"" is very similar to that of the ""X-Files"" episode ""Monday"". The story centers on Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal). The film begins with Stevens waking up on a train. He realizes, that he is in someone else's body. Within a few minutes, the train wakes up, where he regains conciseness in what is called a ""Source Code"". It is explained to him that the ""Source Code"" is a modern invention that allows one to experience the last eight minutes of a person's life. Stevens's objective is to find the bomb on the train.

4497569,4,B004XQO90E,"I'm a sucker for high concept movie ideas, and Source Code has a great one. A soldier must relive the last 8 minutes of a train crash over and over until he figures out who planted the bomb. Whenever he ""dies"", he finds himself in a high tech capsule in some military installation, where his superiors drive him to ""try harder next time."" The only problem is, the soldier (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) doesn't know why he's here, or how to go about doing his duty. The last thing he remembers is crashing his helicopter in Afghanistan.

The movie is great at reinventing ways to play the same scene over and over. Red herrings abound, and some threads are never resolved. All the while, the folks playing with this ""Source Code"" device are running out of time, and Gyllenhaal is discovering a few things about himself that maybe he didn't want to know.

It's as least as much fun to wonder what you would do in this situation, as it is to watch what Jake's character is actually doing. He uses quite a bit of brute force in his methods, which leads to some fun and tense action scenes. He's helped along by a company of bizarre train mates, every one of whom looks or acts suspicious. When he finally zeroes in on the real killer, it leaves us wondering just what all those other folks are up to.

The movie is short, around 90 minutes, and the length feels about right for this concept. It even explores some deeper territory near the end, as Jake wonders how much of his future he can really control. It's definitely a darker take on the Groundhog Day concept, and the ending will likely leave you pondering over several questions.",1313452800,3,1631,4.484848484848484

Instead of comedy with Bill Murray you get an action film with Jake Gyllenhaal that exceeded my expectations.

Gyllenhaal connects to the Source Code through a device that allows him to experience the last eight minutes of a person's life. The movie explains that this is not necessarily time travel, but rather placing the user in an alternate time line, universe or something like that. Um...okay. Even though I've tried and failed to get my mind around the difference and what exactly it all means, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish. The movie keeps the action and suspense coming as Gyllenhaal time after time is thrown back in time...er, I mean, into an alternate whatever...in order to discover the location of a bomb aboard a train and more importantly identify who put it there and detonated it.

Gyllenhaal practically is a one man show albeit with some rather small supporting moments from the other main characters. Source Code might just be Gyllenhaal's best performance to date (that I've seen). I guess some kudos should also go to Michelle Monaghan for playing her part so uniquely but also precisely in the succession of ""on the train again ""Groundhog Dayesque"" sequences.

A good question -- and one that Jake Gyllenhaal's soldier character must unravel, as he relives the last eight minutes before a deadly explosion, again and again and again.

This film answers that question, and concludes, in an admirable manner. It is does not waste time trying to give us details that we wouldn't accept anyway, but just presents the answer, and keeps going. The acting is great, the mystery intriguing, and the filming done in such a way as to draw you in. You, as the viewer, know no more than Gyllenhaal's character, and so learn only what he learns, as he learns it. You get frustrated, as he does, with each failed attempt to uncover the killer. You are relieved at his successes and astonished by the surprises that he encounters. As he gets to know his companion, you feel that you, too, get to know her -- for no replay is exactly the same as the other, and so you see different glimpses of her personality.

By time you are half way through the film, you will have caught inklings of the ending; but it's nice to have your suspicions confirmed -- or refuted, depending on what you picked up from those earlier scenes.

This is not a ""believable"" movie, but, if you put your sense of disbelief on hold, it all seems plausible -- within the context of the film, there are no glaring omissions or contradictions.

The taking over another person element.  The ""do you really know what's going on?"" element.  This starts to sound like some of those special effect without a story sort of films, but the creators of this feature actually put the various components to good use and make a product greater than the sum of it's parts.

The best thing about this film, for me at least, is the triumph of the main character over seemingly impossible circumstances in the face of others who naysay his efforts...even impeding those efforts.

4497592,4,B004XQO90E,"""Source Code"" is director Duncan Jones' second feature film, after the existential science fiction drama ""Moon"" (2009) took viewers back to the thoughtful sci-fi of the 1970s. Elements of that style are in evidence in the unretouched look of ""Source Code"", which, in spite of its contemporary setting, shares some of the same themes. Capt. Colter Stephens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a Chicago-bound commuter train not knowing where he is or how he got there. The last thing he remembers was being a helicopter pilot with the 17th Airborne in Afghanistan. Now he sits opposite a woman named Christina (Michelle Monaghan), who calls him Sean and seems friendly. Colter's reflection in the mirror is unfamiliar to him, and, before he can figure it out, the train explodes in a fiery ball.

Now Colter is strapped into a capsule as a woman speaks to him through a monitor screen about an operation called Beleaguered Castle. She tries to help him regain cogent thought processes. Her name is Capt. Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), and she explains that the train he was just on exploded this morning, killing those aboard. Colter's mission is to go back and find the bomber, so a second terrorist attack can be prevented. He has 8 minutes. He's not traveling back in time, but into the residual memories of a man who was killed on the train. And so Colter goes back to the train, Christina, the explosion, the capsule, Capt. Goodwin. Again and again, as he hunts for the bomber, an understanding of himself, and of the implications of the technology that enables him.

It reminded me of ""Moon"" in its identity crisis and artificial reality, constructed for the benefit, or imprisonment, of the protagonist. This has a slicker, action-movie tone, though, rather than the contemplative pace of 1970s sci-fi. There is romance, action, and existentialism. And ""Source Code"", the mind-bending fusion of quantum mechanics and neurobiology that sends Colter into a dead man's memories, is billed as ""a powerful weapon in the War on Terror."" I felt the ending was a bit of a cop-out, and I'm not sure that it makes sense. But Colter's existential adventure does make sense, and there is enough action to keep the audience engaged even though, like our protagonist, we keep ending up back on the same train. Duncan Jones is now two-for-two and a promising talent.

The DVD (Summit Entertainment 2011): There are 2 featurettes, an optional Trivia Track that you can run during the film, and an audio commentary. ""Cast and Crew Insights"" (35 min) interviews cast and director about themes, characters, and each other, in 11 parts. Some nice comments, but it is repetitive and too long. ""Focal Points"" (7 min) presents the technical ideas used in the film in 5 parts: memory recall, military virtual reality simulations, quantum physics, many worlds theory, and brain computer interface. The audio commentary is by director Duncan Jones, actor Jake Gyllenhaal, and writer Ben Ripley. They compare the film to earlier drafts, discuss technical details and directorial decisions, filming, and Gyllenhaal shares his experiences. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish.",1312243200,4,3198,5.041587901701323

You would think that going back to the same scene over and over would make this movie boring, but the strange thing is that this movie is not boring.  Each time around we find out a little more about what is happening.

Towards the end it got a little confusing, but if anybody says that s/he understands quantum mechanics means that that person really does not quite understand it.

The movie is a combination of sci-fi, love story, action, and mystery all at once.  Top rate acting, casting, script, an interesting story line, and very good special effects.

Also watch the government propaganda within the film concerning terrorist and who is shown as one. Military surveillance of citizens shown as a good thing. CNN advertisement as credible news source. Pure propaganda and advertisement.",1311897600,2,396,5.844827586206897
4497598,4,B004XQO90E,"The movie opens with gorgeous shots of Chicago.  It's a beautiful day and the regular train heading into the city is passing by houses, fields, forests...and then the main character wakes up.  A gorgeous woman is mid-conversation with him and yet he has no idea who she is, or what she's talking about....a few minutes later, the train explodes and he dies.

Then he wakes up...he's in a SIM and being asked to go back and redo everything we just saw...a woman then calls him ""Captain"", and says he will have ten mins just like before.

Opening the film is also some of the best Hitchcock-themed music I've ever heard.  It really sets the stage for what will be a thriller with a small budget.  There are essentially 3 sets...a train, a SIM unit, and a command center...that's it...no wild foot chases through the streets of Chicago, no machine guns, planes shooting missiles, etc....its a simply story, where the viewer discovers things at the same time as the central character.  This means one thing...we get to guess what is about to happen...this ads the ""fun"" aspect, something much needed in a film where we watch a man being repeatedly murdered.

It is definitely a science fiction film, having time-travel...or something like it...thrown in to the typical terrorist yarn.  Of all the films mentioned I agree with everyone who says this is Quantum Leap meets Groundhog day...maybe with a little Deja-Vu peppered in.

Don't expect Transformers 3, Bad Boys, Iron Man, The Town, etc...this isn't a 100 million dollar summer blockbuster...its a small science fiction story that every person needs to see at least once.  As for me, I saw it in theaters twice...something I rarely ever do (Inception, Dark Knight, Iron Man, Catch Me If You Can, and Chicago are the only films that come to mind).

Finally, the ending is jaw dropping, makes zero sense, and requires another viewing or two...talk about it with friends, that's what good films are supposed to make you do anyway.",1311811200,4,1978,4.836795252225519
4497599,4,B004XQO90E,"SOURCE CODE, like the similarly themed ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is a love story in a sci-fi environment.  In both films, the hero does anything to protect the woman he loves.  In CODE, Jake Gylenhaal is a soldier who is assigned the task of preventing a terrorist attack on a commuter train in Chicago, which will result in the death of his girl friend, Michelle Monaghan.  This is accomplished by a secret government agency's ""source code""---a device that gives Jake 8 minute time segments to find the bomb and the terrorist.
Director Duncan Jones elicits good performances from his leads, as well as Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright as the government agents controlling Jake.  Jones focuses on the people instead of producing an action film, and that's commendable.
SOURCE CODE is certainly a well-made film, but its predictable in its finale, and I found myself somewhat confused at the ending.  Since I don't want to spoil anything, I can't go into further detail, but I can't say SOURCE CODE is a great film, but it is enjoyable.",1311811200,,1026,4.84
4497600,5,B004XQO90E,"I like this sort of stuff. I always will. I'll buy the DVD and it will sit alongside Saboteur and all four versions of the 39 Steps. It will reside on the same shelf as Nick of Time and Narrow Margin, squeezed in beside that similarly themed actioner with sci fi undertones, Dj vu. The tale is more or less the same as usual; hero saves the day and claims the prize, whatever that might be. If the writers can make the task seem impossible, that's great, give the hero some self doubt or something else to overcome, even better, if they spend a bit of cash on stuff blowing up, I'm there with the popcorn. If they can cast the movie with decent looking humans who do their best to say their lines with conviction, I'll grab a spoon and dig in to that Jelly. I'm not bothered about the technicalities of time travel, body swapping, alternate realities or any messages about the state of the world or who I am in it. If the tale moves swiftly from A to Z without me having to take notes I'll salute that flag. In short then, and to summarize, it ticked all my boxes.",1311811200,,1064,4.220588235294118
4497601,4,B004XQO90E,"This is a pretty good scifi movie. It's kinda like a cross between Groundhog Day, 12 Monkeys and The Matrix (don't worry, that actually works out). For those fans of time travel movies, this movie will add something unexpected and novel to your cinematic experience (it did for me anyway and I've seen quite a few scifi films).

Now, for a little technical divergence on the topic of time travel in movies. Some time travel movies are inconsistent (incoherent plots with contradictions) such as the Back To the Future movies. 12 Monkeys, on the other hand, involves a causal loop scenario and was also quite a good movie. Both 12 Monkeys and Source Code involve time travel scenarios that, though abstract and somewhat convoluted, at least makes coherent sense. Source Code instead uses a ""forking universe"" or ""branching universe"" scenario to avoid the inconsistencies which commonly rear their ugly heads in plots involving backward time travel. I don't remember seeing this particular device ever used in a movie to make sense of backward time travel. I really do appreciate film makers who take the time to work out coherent time travel scenarios. It takes some effort but I feel like those who make inconsistent time travel films are insulting their audiences' intelligence. I know the film maker for Source Code (Duncun Jones) probably thought about time travel quite a bit in graduate school working on his PhD in philosophy so it's not a surprise that that experience shows itself in a more nuanced, coherent and sophisticated plot.

Bare with the plot a little and even see it twice. For the most part, it makes sense and it is well worth it. Jones also incorporates a sensitivity to his movies exposing a very human frailty in his protagonists. Like his previous scifi movie Moon, the protagonist for this movie played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is deeply mistaken about his identity through extremely unusual and interesting circumstances. Also much like Moon he is mislead by those in power and eventually finds out that he is being used but finds an interesting way to gain back his dignity and some freedom in a very difficult situation (and win the girl in the end for Gyllenhaal's character). I liked Moon a lot better than Source Code but that only says how much I loved Moon. Source code is definitely not a ""sophomore"" flop for Jones.",1311724800,5,2346,4.8625
4497602,3,B004XQO90E,"Source Code has been likened to Groundhog Day, Matrix, and Quantum Leap. Perhaps in a glancing way, yes. It's really a pale, simplistic riff on 12 Monkeys, the superb sci-fi starring Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Source Code manages to cover very little ground (in the ""past"" world) and provide minimal character development when compared to 12 Monkeys. I do like the fact that it has an upbeat ending (possible spoiler**: although it's flawed from a pure sci-fi, quantum-theory standpoint - definitely invokes a paradox when you consider who Jake must be in the end). This movie is perfect for an evening that needs no intellectual challenges, minimal violence or bad language, and ends with a positive love-story. Definitely has a good triumphs over evil theme and in the end love conquers all - and that makes it worth watching.",1311724800,5,829,4.928571428571429
4497603,4,B004XQO90E,"Though some might say he's there already, I'd say Jake is just getting going. He's so ridiculously likeable, but somewhat distant, yet always engagingly intelligent in alomst everything he does...it's a unique take on things and every time out he brings it home. Same as always here, with a good script milking the old time travel cliches to fit our current manufactured obsession with the guaranteed-to-be-never-ending War On Terror. With the wrong lead this film could really blow, but Gyllenhall keeps it happening from start to finish.

Source Code is another crisp character study of one man up against oblivion, as with the director's first film, Moon, and it works just as well. Come to think of it, Jake and Sam Rockwell would be an excellent pairing in a movie. Hello, Hollywood...

There's a lot of Philip K. Dick in here, from ideas to tone, and the best part is the clever ending, which borrows from many previous time travel works to fashion a best-of-genre ending that's cheesy yet also pretty satisfying, using technology to fulfill our desire for immortality along with happy endings (oxymoronic though that may be...hey, no one ever said we were that smart...). Yet the final conceit, the morally upright soldier doing what's right against her superior's wishes, is a great concept but almost non-existent in the real world military. We only wish our soldiers put people before protocol. Oh well, this is a fantasy after all...

If you like sci-fi or Gyllenhall (in super crisp hi-def blu-ray closeups!) or some edgy, mostly non-violent suspense, Source Code will keep you locked into an interesting mind loop for an hour and a half of your life.

Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga star in this critically acclaimed mind-bender that focuses on a soldier who wakes up in the body of an unknown man only to realize he's part of a mission to identify the bomber of a commuter train barreling into a Chicago station.

Moon was Duncan Jones' first movie he directed and the second time around he again succeeds with Source Code. The movie is an intelligent crafted suspense action thriller that never lets up. There is not a dull moment in Source Code. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is a soldier stationed in Afghanistan mysteriously wakes up on a train. At first he doesn't exactly know where he is and what is happening. What he soon finds out is that he is the main part of a project and investigation to find out who placed a bomb on the train. He has 8 minutes to figure this out, which is all the time the source code allows him. The inventor of the source code, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) sends him on the mission to find who the bomber is and what the bombers next move is. This is not a spoiler, since we see it in the trailer, but he can keep being sent back to 8 minutes before the explosion to investigate and each time he goes back he is faced with new challenges. In order to achieve anything, he has to overcome many obstacles and along the way there is a few good twists and turns. The film alternates between the real world and the parallel universe, both of which Colter is a part of. His main source of communication in the real world is Colleen (Vera Farmiga) and on the train in the alternate world he meets a girl name Christina (Michelle Monaghan). Overall, the cast does an excellent job and there is a believable amount of suspense going on. The characters show a great ordeal of emotions throughout which helps make this movie 4.5/5. Simply put, Source Code is one of the best movies to be released in 2011 and is worthy of adding to your collection.

Video Quality
The level of detail is excellent. The aspect ratio of 1.85:1 will fill your entire HD screen and in my opinion this was a good route to go for this particular film. The movie opens up with an areal view of the city of Chicago and the detail is breathtaking. For the most part the picture has a push toward a colder blue tinge that showcases excellent detail all around with good color accuracy. Close ups of faces are incredibly sharp as you could make out ever pore and wrinkle. The transfer even holds up really well in some of the darker scenes. There were times where the black level was a bit off and some minor aliasing issues, but those were the only negatives and was a rare occurrence.

Audio Quality
The DTS-HD audio track is near reference level. The bombing explosion of the train could be heard loud and clear with deep bass that shakes the room. Dialogue is pitch perfect and surround effects are used really well whether its a sonic explosion or in regular scenes where people are talking. This is a busy movie where a lot is going on at all times so even the littlest things can be heard throughout. The sound mix here is excellent all around. You may need to actually turn the volume down from time to time whenever the movie switches between the alternate world and the real world.",1311638400,2,2992,4.418478260869565

This is a very good movie, but one you must pay attention to in order to follow it easily.  This is from the same director of ""Moon"", so if you have seen that movie you will know what to expect from this movie.

One of the better sci-fi/thrillers along the lines of ""Inception"" and ""Adjustment Bureau"", not as good as those, but comparisons could be drawn.  Overall, a very interesting movie that needs to be seen more then once in order to fully get what you need out of it.  I liked it though.  I give it a B+.

The Movie 4/5

Director Duncan Jones has had an impressive start to his career. Moon (2009) saw Sam Rockwell turn in a very good performance and Source Code has built on that success. Jones has attracted a wonderful cast and the $32 million budget allows for a more spectacular presentation. Moon reminded me of older classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, but Source Code feels like a modern story.

The movie is a thriller with a strong science fiction element, but it also plays like a mystery. The opening scene shows Captain Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) on a train in Chicago. When he sees his reflection in the window of the train, it's not him. Christina (Monaghan), the woman in the opposite seat, calls him Sean. A few minutes later we see the train explode and Stevens wakes up alone in a chamber of some kind.

Jones shows us everything from the viewpoint of Stevens, so we only gradually come to understand the situation. Stevens is part of an experimental project which enables him to inhabit the body of somebody else. The project is led by Dr. Rutledge (Wright) and Colleen Goodwin (Farmiga).

They can only communicate with Stevens by using a camera and a computer screen. He's told that he must find out where the bomb is and uncover the person responsible for planting it. He can't avoid the explosion, but the information could prevent a future disaster involving the bomber. He can only inhabit the body of Sean for eight minutes at a time. So we see Stevens trying to gather information. Each time the train explodes, the pattern resets and he tries again. It's like a blend of Groundhog Day and Quantum Leap.

We have a race against the clock to prevent further terrorism and that keeps us on the edge of our seats. There's also the chance of romance between Sean and Christina, as well as great special effects. Comedian Russell Peters provides most of the comic relief. This package has plenty to keep us hooked. At the outset I expected one of the twists to be that Sean turns out to be the bomber, but I was wrong. Couldn't Stevens simply take over the body of the bomber on his next visit once he found out who it was, or does the technology only allow you to access people who are ""compatible"" with you?

Put yourself in that position for a moment. If you were a train passenger tasked with uncovering the identity of a bomber, how would you proceed? Would you be polite to total strangers as you questioned them? How about contacting the guard and explaining the situation? Whatever course of action you choose, the train will explode in eight minutes (unless you locate and disarm the bomb). That allows Jones to break the established rules somewhat. If the pattern resets each time, he can do anything. Sean can be rude, engage in criminal activity, or follow incredibly dangerous courses of action. He could even kill or be killed. That makes the movie less predictable than most.

I won't reveal what does happen, but hopefully I've described the situation well enough for you to know whether you'll like the movie.

The movie raises some serious themes such as how the line between right and wrong can become blurred. In a sense it also deals with the issue of slavery, just as Moon did.

Jones has produced another interesting idea and turned it into a thrilling story. The four main actors turned in good performances and the whole thing worked well for me. I'm a fan of the whole Groundhog Day concept and enjoy Run Lola Run for the same reason. There have also been episodes of The X-Files and Star Trek Next Generation dealing with the same concept.

Video Quality 4.5/5
I detected slight aliasing on a couple of overhead shots of the city, but it's only there for a second or two. Colors look bright and clear, although red tint is slightly enhanced in facial shots. Detail is strong throughout, especially in close-ups. This is a pleasing transfer and exactly what you would expect from a recent release.

Audio Quality 4.5/5
There's a lot going on in Source Code and the English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track handles everything well. The explosions carry real weight and the ambient effects, such as coffee spilling, are easy to detect. The dialogue is clear throughout and the score adds to the atmosphere of the movie.

Special Features 2.5/5

Audio Commentary with Director Duncan Jones, Writer James Ripley and Actor Jake Gyllenhaal.

Access Source Code - A PiP feature including comments from cast and crew as well as trivia and expert comments on time travel. While the navigation was a little annoying, the features offer plenty of information once accessed.

I don't think it matters whether the plot is airtight; it's a piece of entertainment. This is a movie that can be enjoyed as an action thriller, but it could attract others due to the science fiction or romantic elements. For those that like to think, the science fiction elements definitely provide food for thought. I enjoyed Source Code in the theater and am happy to finally have it in my collection. The Blu-ray presentation is worthy of the excellent story.

Jake plays a helicopter pilot named Colter who has been ""killed"" in combat and should be dead, but when his brain still shows signs of activity he's entered into a test program called Source Code.  It claims that when someone dies, their brain records the last eight minutes of their life.  The military created Source Code to insert someone else into that eight minute recording in disguise as the dead person in order to combat terrorists or learn more information about who committed the crime. Colter is being sent onto a passenger train bound for Chicago, disguised as a teacher who was on that train, in order to find out who planted a bomb on it. The bomber is claiming to blow up Chicago later that day, as the train has already exploded that morning and Colter is ""going back in time"" in sort of a role playing scenario to figure out who did it.

The conflict here is that Colter doesn't know how all of this is possible.  He has no knowledge of his real life events or of the events that have already taken place with the train.  He thinks he's in some sort of training simulation.  As details are unveiled to both him and the viewer, the plot really gets going and both will begin to contemplate what is real and what is imaginary.  And Colter begins to wonder if his actions in Source Code can or cannot really affect what has already happened.

It's deeper than just time travel and much more intense that just some military action thriller.  Jake does a good job in this one and his acting seemed very real and believable.  I didn't remember much about the movie when it was first being advertised, but it looked good enough to rent and I'm glad I did.  I was well pleased overall and definitely taken by surprise.

4497634,5,B004XQO90E,"SOURCE CODE has an element that is lacking in too many of the Hollywood CGI sci-fi experimental movies that are so very cloned these day - humanity.  Much of the credit for this quality comes from the intelligent and imaginative writing of Ben Ripley and the tight direction by Duncan Jones, but the main reason this film works so well is the presence of charismatic and fine acting by Jake Gyllenhaal.

The story borders on the obtuse: a device has been invented by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) that can maintain a person in a state of recall much the way a light bulb has a glow after it has been extinguished.  Rutledge has placed helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is missing in action in Afghanistan, in a capsule that is capable, under the direction of military officer Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), of projecting Stevens  onto a train entering Chicago that has been planted with a bomb in order to discover the perpetrator who is apparently planning another bomb that will decimate the city of Chicago.  It is a back and forth series of 8 minute exercises, each time Stevens relives the moments before a bomb detonation and gradually learns the the device and its owner. On board the train he meets Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who 'sees' Stevens as her boyfriend Sean and during these repeat flashbacks Stevens and Christina form a bond that makes Stevens re-think his 'purpose' in this military gimmicky.

*In the hands of the wrong people this little venture would seem trite and silly, but with this crew of creators it becomes a puzzle that touches on tension, fear, humor, and warmth.

It makes us look at a public scene where some imminent violence or calamity is about to take place, and then backs up to show us the same scene again with a different point-of-view.

The story begins with a disoriented Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who finds himself on a commuter train headed to Chicago.  Next to him is a woman identifying herself as his girlfriend, Christine (Michelle Monaghan).  A series of events take place:  Someone spills coffee on his shoe; he gets up; someone knocks over a file with papers in it; and he goes to the bathroom where a mirror shows him to be someone else than he knows himself to be.

After several awkward moves, he sees his train pass another train, and both blow up into oblivion...Then, we are taken into a military vessel, much resembling a small space unit, where Colter is received on a screen with instructions from Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who gets him to use a ""source code"" technology, which enables him to relive the scene, find information, and prevent otherwise inevitable catastrophe.

He fights the mission with a fervent confusion--not able to fully comprehend when he was on an earlier mission--not in incognito and on the war front of Afghanistan.  To get him on track, Goodwin and her superior officer, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), have to brief him as quickly as possible because their intelligence program is in experimental infancy with many harrowing risks for Colter and civilization at large...

The causality of `Source Code' is easily as fanciful as `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception/dp/B002ZG980U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception</a>,' but the story is much easier to follow, and the format and development admirably suspend disbelief in ways that few movies do.  While similar movies can be awkwardly paced, tediously unfolded, or convoluted beyond our senses, `Source Code' is satisfying popcorn entertainment with an admirable message about the brevity and preciousness of life without ever being weighed down by stale or labored moments.

4497638,3,B004XQO90E,"Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up inside the body of another man - get your mind out of the gutter, I mean ""inside"" like Quantum Leap - he must use his next eight minutes efficiently, because the train he's on is about to explode.  How does he know this?  Well, it turns out Stevens is part of the Source Code, a secret government program that can use ""parabolic calculus"" (whatever that is) to fold time and put him into another person's identity.  A little like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu with Denzel except their superior technology had a 4 day window and...actually, it's a LOT like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu.

This borderline plagiarism would have been better off using the term ""velluvial matrix"" instead of ""parabolic calculus"" to explain the technology, because there are numerous problems with the time travel aspects of this film.  For instance, if there is an 8-minute window, and the concept behind the limitations is glossed over, why can't it be 8.5 minutes?  Or 9 minutes?  For something so unknown and unexplained it sure has a strict timeframe.  Second, some of the movements and discoveries while possessing Chicago school teacher Sean Fentress are simply impossible.  If Fentress never did it, he couldn't possibly have the memories capable of supporting Stevens' escapades throughout the train.  What I'm trying to say is, ignore the metaphysical connections because the science is pointless.  Nonetheless, the majority of this film is enjoyable.

Gyllenhaal exudes anguish in most roles, which made him perfect for Stevens.  He's unaware, dazed, and rushes through each 8-minute iteration with the gusto of irritable bowel sufferer.  Vera Farmiga, who I normally enjoy, appears to be coasting through her role as the pseudoscience facilitator, giving Stevens helpful guidance along the way (e.g. look for bags, hold on I'm playing Minesweeper).  Although, a more military and scientific approach to finding someone responsible for crimes in a parallel plain of existence would be to simply kill half of the people.  If the event doesn't happen, the culprit is in the dead half.  If it happens, next time around kill half of the left overs.  Divide by two ad nauseum.  Even the terrorist portion doesn't make a ton of sense.  One of the most predictable misdirections in cinema history is created when a Hollywood political slant is subtly inserted.  Ultimately, however, the movie asks more questions than it answers, and an ambiguous ending furthers the confusion.

It's fun, well made, and performed well.  But if you think too deeply, the brain shutoff valve is necessary.",1309392000,11,2603,5.145238095238096
4497639,5,B004XQO90E,"Most critics and audiences find this an extremely satisfying movie.  But one common criticism is that the science in the science fiction is illogical.  Thing is, not so much.

A large number of cosmologists have recently been exploring the idea that the seemingly inexplicable nature of creation of the universe might best be explained by an infinite (not ""large"", but infinite) number of universes.  Where everything that could possibly happen has happened.  Two recent books about this by _very_ serious guys are Stephen Hawkings The Grand Design, and Brian Greene's The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos.  One variant of the theory has each universe splitting all the time into more universes going down different paths.

Most all people find it very difficult to wrap their brains around these concepts (which Greene acknowledges and tries bravely to overcome).  It's that difficulty which many of the negative critics have.  As well as some of the characters in the movie.

But personally, I see the most difficult bits of Source Code for critics to accept as a very clever riff on the possibilities of these theories.  There's more to the movie conceptually, and the way that the hero visits the multiple scenarios is properly described as pure magic (the major similarity between this movie and Groundhog Day).  But both the multiple scenarios and the possibilities of those scenarios are actually grounded in cutting edge science, and while it's a science that many find hard to swallow, some very serious folks are exploring it seriously.

So, if you're not a science fiction fan or a scientist, see the movie simply because it's real good.  But if you are, there's relatively little that will annoy you as unscientific, and much that will delight you.  It's top notch science fiction, and, in my opinion, it bats in 2001's league.",1308268800,2,1873,5.016181229773463

The storyline centers around Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal)- an American Army helicopter pilot whose last memory is flying in Afghanistan. He then wakes up on a commuter train, but he looks like someone else.

The movie starts off like an adventure computer game, where you are thrown into a scenario where you are not sure where you are and what is really happening. As the movie progresses, you begin to realize that Colter is also in the same position, being totally unaware of his full situation.

The movie is very interesting and like the case with Ground Hog Day, in each iteration of the eight minutes, Colter gets more and more done. The story is quite gripping and unfolds on two levels:

- [1] the Train bomb situation
- [2] the real situation of Colter Stevens

The latter is quite moving emotionally and draws you into a deep longing that Colter has to make peace with his father and to hear his voice just one last time.

So, although it may not be quite original in its design, there is a lot of emotional content to absorb the viewer in. In my opinion, it is a good movie and well portrayed. The end had a nice twist to it. Enjoy.",1306281600,,1416,4.34469696969697

There are a couple scenes of gorgeously shot, tear-jerkingly beautiful brilliance. That, and the cinematography is worth noting- It is very slick and tone-setting. But the way this movie plays out, it's almost like a parody of the intellectial science fiction thriller.

The story has been done before- a computer program where you are allowed to enter someone's body. The Matrix did it, and to a lesser extent but not in the form of a computer program- Being John Malkovich, that movie where a portal was opened in an office building and you could enter John Malkovich's mind for a few minutes. Except here, the program is so that Jake Gyllenhaal can find the bomber of a train.

The acting is unbelievably bad. I felt like I was watching a cheaply made TV movie. Gyllenhaal was acted off the screen by that ridiculous hairpiece of his.

4497649,5,B004XQO90E,"Source Code is a suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent, occasionally touching, movie that's far better than I'd expected it to be. With tight pacing, great editing, good acting and fine directing by Duncan Jones, best known for Moon, it's a very good sci-fi action film released outside the usual summertime area for such movies.

The film tells the tale of a man (Jake Gyllenhall), who wakes up on a train. He has no idea why he's there or who the woman across from him is. As he's trying to get things sorted out, an explosion goes off, killing everyone. He then comes to inside a capsule where it's explained to him that the train was blown up in a terrorist bombing. The terrorist was kind enough to do a practice run and apparently plans to detonate a dirty bomb in Chicago. Due to some sort of ""quantum"" effect he can ""leap"" into the body of a man who died on the train and live out his last eight minutes of life. Doing that will, with luck, enable him to find the bomber.

If it's a premise that sounds familiar, that's because it is. It's perhaps no surprise that Scott Bakula's voice turns up in a cameo during the movie, since it clearly owes a lot to his most famous work. In fact, it's basically Quantum Leap mashed-up with Groundhog Day while managing to be better than the first and at least as engaging as the second.

There was really nothing I disliked about this film. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best film I've seen so far this year, and, sadly, will likely be the best science fiction film for quite some time.",1305849600,5,1545,4.395104895104895
4497650,4,B004XQO90E,"Time slip movies have a tendency to be more cerebral in that they deal more with the puzzle on how events will play out. The better ones infuse a stronger human element into them. This is one of the better ones.

Here's the scoop. Jake Gyllenhall awakens on a commuter train 8 minutes before a bomb goes off. He's a bit confused in that he doesn't recognize himself in the mirror and he seems to be involved in an ongoing conversation, that he doesn't quite remember, with another passenger played by Michelle Monaghan. Before you know it, he's replaying the same scenario with a few twists to it. And, as it turns out, he will keep replaying said scenario until he is able to identify the bomber. Not to save the train, but to apprehend the bad guy before he sets off a dirty bomb in Chicago.

As others have mentioned, this is ""Groundhog Day"" meets ""Deja Vu."" The first time we witness the 8 minutes we're more than a bit confused, but the writer and director do a great job of filling in the blanks with each successive re-run. They also do a great job in bringing us deeper into both Jake's and Michelle's characters with each replaying, as well as the characters of his controller (played nicely by Vera Farmiga) and her boss.

The performances are great. The production values are great. The location scouts did an outstanding job, as did those handling the music, editing, etc. The script is good for the abovementioned reasons. As the movie progresses you get know more about the Gyllenhaal character and how he came to be in this scenario. Something happens at the end (and I won't spoil it) that normally might have put the audience in tears but actually made me feel good. This is a mature effort on everyone's behalf. It could have been a very shallow undertaking but the low road was mercifully avoided. Hats off to the writer and director for spending as much time and effort on the characters as they did on the plot. When this hits DVD it won't be a renter for me.

4497651,4,B004XQO90E,"On the surface, the trailers for Source Code give you the impression of an action film dealing with themes that have been done before in other sci-fi - and fantasy - films and shows like Groundhog Day, Quantum Leap, Frequency, The Matrix and others. And while Source Code does involve ideas that have already been done, it does it in ways that raise it head and shoulders above most films in the genre, mainly in the way its characters react to the situation they find themselves in, and in the extremely fine performances given by Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright and a host of others. You believe in their characters, and because of that, you believe the situation they're in and you come to care about them.

I have to be careful not to give anything away because a lot of Source Code comes in a series of revelations, so I'll limit the set-up to what you can see in the trailers. The film begins with a man named Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) suddenly waking up on a train, not seeming to know where he is. His confusion only increases when he finds a woman sitting across from him, Christina (Monaghan), thinks he is someone else, a friend of hers named Sean Fentress. Disoriented, Stevens makes his way to the bathroom, only to find his reflection in the mirror is that of Fentress, whose ID he finds in his wallet. His immediate confusion comes to an abrupt end moments later when the train is ripped apart by a bomb, killing him and everyone on board.

Or so it would seem, until he wakes up again, this time in some kind of military-esque environment pod, where we learn that Stevens is an Army helicopter pilot and his last memory, prior to waking up on the train, was being shot down while on a mission in Afghanistan. On a computer screen in the pod, a female Air Force officer, Captain Goodwin (Farmiga), begins talking Stevens out of his confusion. Stevens learns that he's part of a program called Beleagured Castle, and that he's being used to try and stop a terrorist who, having blown up the train, is planning on detonating a 'dirty' nuclear device in downtown Chicago in a matter of hours.  The scientist behind Beleagured Castle, Dr. Rutledge (Wright), has devised a technique involving quantum physics which allows them to create a ""source code"" version of the train bombing and to insert Stevens into the body of Fentress, a passenger on the doomed train, eight minutes before the bomb goes off. And they have to keep inserting Stevens back in again and again with the mission of finding the bomb and, more importantly, finding out the identity of the bomber behind it, before the threatened detonation of the nuclear device is carried out.

A love interest unsurprisingly develops between Stevens and Christina, but it's handled in a way that you can actually believe it. But for me, the most moving parts of the film are the interactions between Stevens and his military handler, Goodwin. Gyllenhaal and Farmiga give outstanding performances as a soldier trying desperately to understand what is happening to him and the sympathetic officer who is in the difficult position of keeping him focused on the mission while knowingly withholding information from him that could jeapordize his ability to complete it.

A lot of talent went into Source Code and it shows.  The director, Duncan Jones (this is his second film after the highly regarded Moon) gets the pacing just right, instinctively knowing when to speed things up, when to slow them down, and how to let things unfold, always keeping you engaged with the characters.  The writer, Ben Ripley, makes his first real mark here in giving Source Code's characters a level of human depth and believability that most films of the genre lack. Ripley gives the sci-fi aspects their due, but knows that the heart of any film is in the characters and in how the audience connects with them. And the evocative musical score by Chris Bacon is deftly done, adding to the mood of a scene while never overwhelming or distracting from what's happening.

Note: a nice nod in the film to the TV show Quantum Leap was the choice of Scott Bakula, who played Sam Beckett, as the voice of Stevens' father.

Overall, well done, highly enjoyable, and highly, highly recommended.",1304812800,2,4266,4.754054054054054

While ""Source Code"" may sound like a more serious version of ""Groundhog Day"" (which may or may not have found inspiration in a short story by author Richard Lupoff that had the same premise as both films). While quite a good film the premise has its limitations and flaws; the character played by Michelle Monaghan isn't really well developed because we get to see so little of her in those eight minutes that are repeated like an endless loop. Still, the screenplay (and director Jones) do the best they can within the confines of the premise.

The Blu-ray has a sharp, superb looking transfer. Audio sounds terrific throughout with nice action spread throughout the surround channels.

Some people have complained about the ending--I liked it and found it refreshing after seeing too many films with somewhat downbeat endings although I did find it a bit disturbing--(SPOILERS BELOW):

Our hero ""chooses"" to take over the life of the person he was temporarily ""inhabiting"". Was the result a combination of his memories/personality (much like in ""Quantum Leap"" and, interestingly, Scott Bakula plays our hero's dad on the phone)or did he obliterate the teacher he inhabited? There are some intersting questions left open at the conclusion of the film which has some disturbing consequences as well.

""Access: Source Code"" has trivia, interviews and other bits of information that pops up almost like a picture-in-picture special feature.

""Source Code"" continues to demonstrate considerable talent from Jones and like the similiarly themed ""Deja Vu"" (which had a bit more flexibility with its premise), it's still a clever thriller that makes the most of its recycled premise.",1304467200,,2029,5.224615384615385

4497654,5,B004XQO90E,"Duncan Jones' ""Source Code"" is a taut, intricately plotted thriller with richer-than-usual characters, unusual depth of feeling, and interesting metaphysical overtones. Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), a former helicopter pilot in Afghanistan, finds himself caught in an endless time loop controlled by a sinister scientist (Jeffrey Wright). Stevens is transported again and again to the last eight minutes before a terrorist explosion on a Chicago commuter train, charged with finding the bomber and preventing further carnage. Stevens is forced to scrutinize every passenger on the crowded train, and instructed to use whatever violence he must (all the passengers are dead anyway). However, complications accrue with each successive eight-minute drama, especially Stevens' growing love for fellow passenger Christina (Michelle Monaghan).

Jones and screenwriter Ben Ripley have all sorts of throat-catching surprises for us, including one major plot revelation they spring on us about halfway through (I guessed it about three minutes before the big reveal). With all the nonstop thrills, however, the biggest point about ""Source Code"" is the feelings you develop toward the characters, especially Stevens. Jake Gyllenhaal is extremely appealing as Stevens, combining George Clooney-style heroics with golden-retriever lovability. Michelle Monaghan, with her delicate, heart-shaped face, is no slouch in the lovability department, and Vera Farmiga--as Capt. Goodwin, Stevens' military ""handler""--develops enormous sympathy for her character.

The plot is tense and imaginative, the acting and casting are almost uniformly excellent, and the film looks gorgeous. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Monaghan is charming and the conclusion is very emotionally satisfying. Source Code could have been a fantastic movie except for one thing: the plot contains so many ridiculous logical absurdities that if you recognize them you might be too annoyed to enjoy the film. If you are curious about the logical incongruities and don't mind spoiling the plot, read on, but I must warn you that there is no turning back once you have taken the red pill. Your blissful ignorance will be lost and replaced with the recognition of how hilariously nonsensical this movie really is.

*** SPOILER ALERT ***

The premise, gradually revealed, is that a massive train bombing has taken place in Chicago and the terrorist has given advance notice that he will detonate a radioactive ""dirty bomb"" next. A secret government program is able to ""read"" the final memories of the train bombing victims from their deceased brains by scanning the residual electrical charges in their brains. Please ignore the fact that those brains would have been reduced to ash and scattered over the charred wreckage of the bombing.

Using the memories of the bombing victims, the government mad scientists are able to construct a virtual reality simulation of the eight minutes leading up to the bombing, under the name of project Source Code. The biggest absurdity is that not only are they able to reconstruct what happened, but they are able to simulate what would have happened under entirely different histories. Not only that, but they can simulate the world outside the train, to the point of simulating that the second bomb was hidden in a van parked at a specific location in Chicago. Unfortunately, although the designers of this magical computer simulator can simulate the exact location and design of the second bomb, they have no way of asking their simulator where that might be. In fact, the simulator cannot tell them anything at all. They must resort to sending comatose individuals inside the simulation by attaching their brains to the computer, as in ""The Matrix."" They can then switch the brains over to a different simulation in which the comatose operatives can suddenly communicate with the real world by having their thoughts read, using a teleconferencing system inside the virtual reality. All of this is possible thanks to technological breakthroughs based on ""quantum mechanics and parabolic calculus"" (no joke). Perhaps a more plausible plot device would be that the main character is really a robot with psychic powers, who travels back through time to fight crime.

The crime-fighting operative in this case is a comatose military pilot named Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal). Stevens must identify the terrorist on the train so that his real-life counterpart can be stopped from detonating the second bomb, and every time the eight minutes runs out, he returns to the teleconferencing room to brief his real-world military handler, Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), before being sent back in to try again. A complicating factor is that the other passengers see him as a passenger whom he replaced, a teacher named Sean Fentress, including Fentress's love interest Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan).

As you would expect, Stevens locates the terrorist and stops both bombs after several attempts. This is possible due to a series of lucky coincidences and implausible mistakes by the terrorist. This allows project Source Code to locate and arrest the real-life terrorist as he is driving around in a van with the radioactive bomb. For some reason, the arrest is broadcast live on national television, just like other top-secret anti-terrorist operations. This would make for a bittersweet ending, since the victims of the first bombing are still dead, so the writer opts for an enormous deux ex machina instead. We see that the virtual simulation has turned into some kind of parallel universe where Stevens can go on living as Sean Fentress, whereas ""reality"" has turned into a different parallel universe where both bombings were prevented by other means. Maybe they were alternate universes all along? Goodwin even receives an inter-universal text message from Stevens about how their non-existent plan to stop the first bombing must have worked. The movie ends with Stevens impersonating Fentress to go on a date with Warren inside the computer-simulation-turned-parallel-universe. The End.

4497657,5,B004XQO90E,"The Review:

Source Code came out of nowhere this April to temporarily snag the sci-fi spotlight from soon to be released blockbusters like Thor, Captain America and Green Lantern.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Capt. Colter Stevens who has been tasked with traveling back in time to ascertain the cause of an explosion of a commuter train headed for Chicago.  Unfortunately, Capt. Stevens only has a mere eight minutes each time he makes the time jump due to the severe constraints of time travel.  Failure means game over in a very explosive way, but Capt. Stevens has a lot of do overs, that is unless the train explosion is only the first of several attacks.

Source Code's influences are Quantum Leap, 24 and Groundhog's Day. It borrows some of the best elements of those series and movie and adds its own spin to great effect.  Thankfully the screen writers did a wonderful job of finessing the details of time travel by more or less NOT delving into extraneous details of how it works.  Let's just say it has something to do with quantum mechanics and parabolic calculus.  Basically you'd need a PhD or two to understand it, so like Capt. Stevens you just need to accept it and stay on mission.  While this is a bit of cop out consider that most films that center around time travel usually end up with unresolved, maddening paradoxes -- be it the ridiculous Timecop or the mostly sublime Terminator series. Source Code avoids this problem by dispensing with a drawn out explanation of what are essentially arbitrary rules to tell a great story.

Source Code is engaging from beginning to end.  It tells two parallel stories of Capt. Stevens' adventure in the past and his similarly complicated present.  You'll need to keep your thinking cap on tight as the implications of Capt. Stevens attempts to solve the mystery of the exploding train become more apparent.  It's a rare movie that can delve into the nature of realty, time and space while being one of the best action-thrillers of 2011.

It has also been used before in other films but never as well as this.

 The story and the idea are exquisitely worked. The direction is good. The sets and some of the acting are also very good. I was not happy with the command post. It was too common place and low scale. It lacked too much of the importance of the mission, and the actors were too ordinary.

I did not like the boy meets girl sub-story either. It just did not gel and took away from the main line. Father-son was good. Humanity of the main character was excellent. Chicago was a good choice.

He has exactly 8 minutes to find the bomb and the bomber before the train blows just outside of Chicago.

Some few people can go back in time to the last eight minutes of another's life. Unfortunately, that includes the event that ended it, so it's hardly a pleasure cruise. Much to no one's surprise, the military takes this technology on as a counter-terrorism tool. It's too late to avert the disaster that already happened, but maybe it contains clues that will help prevent a bigger one. Eight minutes is hardly enough to get started, so Colter Stevens has to take the trip again and again, learning a little more each time, and dying again each time.

The action plays well, and plays a little differently in each eight-minute trip (so he can make progress against the terrorist), right to the very end - which contains a pleasant flip. On the whole, this action movie acquits itself much better than lots I can name.

So, what's my beef? The name. Obviously, some Lala-lander heard this cool techie term ""source code"".

It is difficult to wrap the head around the mechanics. He did not change the past or the future (there is no past or future - just the present). His actions in the closely parallel ""new"" world (created via an 8 minute window of residual consciousness) prevented ANY explosion. Through his consciousness, Coulter was able to send his message through ""dimension"" within the eight minute window to report what occurred in the newly created world. Events would match in both worlds.

It is akin to a ""microcosm"" of what we do with each action in life. ""Living in the NOW."" It is based on our consciousness creating & projecting reality, thus forming actuality (Coulter's consciousness ""existing"" in both worlds during the 8 minute flux the story provides, though all of it occurs in the present moment). Turning off life support severs the connection between parallel worlds.

I hope, with the explanation of suspended time (""now"") which is shown in the movie, this explanation makes sense. Slowed down by many times, all we perceive is already a memory - the speed it takes for any phenomena to register in our physiological senses. Any experience is therefore ""change"" or ""in the past,"" creating the conditions for an altered ""future."" It would be the same if an action is NOT made. The conditions would then NOT exist for a particular set of changes to occur. The mechanism for projecting Coulter's consciousness (the box) is the theoretical technology which projects consciousness onto another neural map nearby on that train (in this instance).

Using a structure similar to Groundhog Day, director Duncan Jones avoids boring the viewer with repetition by providing new information in each of Colters eight-minute investigative jaunts.

Source Code is not only a gripping thriller, but a cautionary tale about the dark side of scientific advances and human decency as a counterbalance. Though Colter is, in a sense, a pawn in a much larger game, he is the one who is essential in the process. Unlike many science fiction stores, man has not become unnecessary in a world ruled by technology.
