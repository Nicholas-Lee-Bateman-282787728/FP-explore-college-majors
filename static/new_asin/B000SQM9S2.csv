8206487,3,B000SQM9S2,This is an average Kumite instructional video.  It is not well organized. It seems to be designed for a beginner.,1386547200,,113,4.65
8206488,4,B000SQM9S2,"Not a bad DVD, very informative and explained very well in detail..
I actually tried a couple moves from the DVD and was impressed on how the competitor didn't see the punch coming.. The Kumite at the end of the DVD was okay, they could have picked it up a bit more. The key to making any technique in this DVD to work is to practice... :)",1304035200,,339,4.074626865671642
8206489,3,B000SQM9S2,"I enjoyed this DVD.  It contains some fundamental martial arts sparring concepts that can be used by beginners, but which can also be used for more advanced practitioners wishing to really work basic techniques in sparring.  I definitely recommend this for martial artists who are just beginning to spar.",1193875200,2,304,5.183673469387755
8206490,5,B000SQM9S2,"This dvd is unique because it's perfect to use as you practice.  The techniques are divided into short segments. I have it on as I workout; stopping after each technique and working through it. There are 26 different sets of techniques as well as partner drills and footage of sparring. Many of the drills I hadn't experienced before. The techniques are not flashy, but will work in a match. Don't let the Shotokan title fool you, these techniques are usable and applicable in any style.  I own several dozen sparring videos and would rate this video as the best because you can use it while you train and is not filled with psychological fluff.",1188950400,4,645,4.649122807017544
