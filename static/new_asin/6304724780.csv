7876428,4,6304724780,"I've been a fan of special effects for decades so I bought this when I came across it.  The dvd came in a CD style jewel case and the cover package was more like a PC game box.  The video is good and has a lot of neat information covering almost all aspects of special effects from stop motion to matte paintings to makeup.  However I must point out that the video was made in the 1990s so it is a little dated.  Not much mention of CGI or modern techniques.  Still a good video but as old as it is, if you're into special effects at all you've already seen most of these behind the scenes features.  It is a very good compilation that would be perfect for a high school film or theatre class.  I'm still happy with it.",1390348800,2,719,4.056737588652482
7876429,3,6304724780,"I was hoping to have something I could show my film studies students to explain how special effects are done, but this skips a lot, including such elementary things as back-projection, doesn't really explain how traveling mattes are created, or why front-projection was revolutionary. OK as a bit of entertainment, but not a serious documentary on the subject.",1101772800,5,360,5.224137931034483
