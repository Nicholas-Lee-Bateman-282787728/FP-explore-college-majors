8513184,5,B007A9EGFE,"pretty good price tag. putney swope does the trick and aside from that you get 4 other movies by RDSr that are not bad at all, yet kinda amateurish-like... if you are getting into the eclipse collection and want bang for your buck look nowhere else",1423267200,,248,4.413043478260869
8513185,5,B007A9EGFE,2nd time I have bought it. Worth it each time.,1420848000,,46,3.7
8513186,5,B007A9EGFE,"I 'discovered' Putney Swope just this past year, and it soon became my favorite comedy and an all-time favorite. I also bought the standalone version from another studio (not Criterion) for the commentary and extras. This Criterion edition looks significantly better but has no extras.

I tried getting into the other movies, but what I saw was so purposely weird to the point of being frustrating and not fun. But Putney Swope is so brilliant that I'm glad to have this collection with a high quality transfer.",1374364800,4,511,4.873563218390805
8513187,3,B007A9EGFE,"Warning: you should probably be blitzed out of your mind to properly enjoy these. Otherwise, I found them to be an extremely mixed bag: darts of brilliant satire intermingling with silly jokes that fall flat.

Perhaps it was the times, the context in which they were originally seen--in underground New York theaters where the hippy audiences were indeed blitzed out of their minds--but these films failed to resonate with me completely as successful (sober) movies.

They're so amateurishly threadbare as to make John Waters movies look like Mercury Theater Productions. It is indeed impressive that Robert Downey was able to make these movies the way he did,--shooting guerilla style in the streets, sometimes illegally with a motely crew of assembled actors. There is a sense of wildness and abandon in creation that is both their brilliance and their shortcoming. In this way, this set is certainly important in documenting the beginning of underground cinema. And there ARE very funny parts if you want to sit around and suss them out from the slag.

These films would be great for someone not too picky about their comedies and easy to laugh. Maybe given their unevenness, watching the films at parties with friends, where full attention is not required, might be beneficial, as well.

This Eclipse set does document the beginning of the underground midnight movie phenomenon, but it's probably not as great as that might sound.",1345680000,13,1434,5.089361702127659
8513188,4,B007A9EGFE,"These are wild , disrespectful and dadaist films from the sixities. A cinematic supplement to the early records of the Mothers of Invention etc.",1342483200,5,144,5.041666666666667
