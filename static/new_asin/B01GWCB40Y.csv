7768259,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Don't worry about losing your buttons, worry about losing your eyes and having them replaced by buttons. Admittedly ""Coraline"" is not my cup of tea; I found it overly long, repetitive, and too downbeat, but I appreciated the brilliance, cleverness, originality, innovativeness, and great imaginative leaps taken in the movie. It has a touch of theater of the absurd, but also it had a touch of the Grimm Brothers' grim fairy tales.
The stop action photography used is fantastic.
You're never sure whether you are in a dream world or not because key things happen right after Coraline goes to bed.
Having your eyes removed and buttons sewn on is the worst thing that can happen to you in ""Coraline"" because you thereby lose your soul. Coraline lives in a gloomy old house along with tenants in the basement and a tenant on the top floor. The basement tenants are two old ladies who apparently were vaudeville performers, and there is a fantasy scene in a theater where we see them scantily clad as a trapeze act. They are funny, eccentric characters, but seem to me to be aimed at an older, more sophisticated audience than one for the kiddies.
There are all sorts of incredible creations (spooky spider things), and it is unquestionably a work of genius.
The upper floor tenant is a circus performer who trains mice who performs in a circus tent scene. There's a talking feral cat and a nice kindly boy Coraline's age in the movie.
Coraline's parents are self-absorbed yuppies who have no time for her. The mother never cooks a decent meal, and the father is too busy at his computer keyboard. Her second parents seem so nice, and the mother is a great cook (the corn on the cob looked delicious), but, as it turns out, they have buttons as surprises for her. Instead of losing her buttons, Coraline fears that she is going to lose her eyes and gain two control buttons that she doesn't want.
 This film has scary, creepy stuff, and a thematic melancholy that may be off-putting and tough sledding for young children. It's difficult to say who the audience is for this work. Kafka enthusiasts? Fans of Beckett, Genet, and Kurt Weill? Absurdists? Gloomy Guses?
 We see so much about dysfunctional families that we soon get to see the abnormal as the norm. Critics loved this movie, but the kids I saw were puzzled and made uneasy by it and yet ironically stayed glued to the screen.",1236470400,,2381,4.666666666666667

Some good 3D moments like the tunnel connecting the two worlds together.

Cons:
It seemed slow as far as storytelling goes, despite various key events used to excite the audience.

7768377,2,B01GWCB40Y,"Does this really warrant a 7.7 IMDb score? Not in our opinion. The animation is excellent but the characters, dialog and slow beginning were enough to quit about a third of the way in before the plot of the movie was even reached. Perhaps it resonates better for those who never had parents that were neglectful and saw it in 3-D but the characters and dialog were downright annoying. If a movie hasn't done something to hook you in nearly half way into it what do they think will compel you to hang around any longer? A very disappointing movie compounded by high expectations based on the glowing reviews. I tend to stick longer with movies I paid to rent but there was absolutely nothing that made us want to even give it another 5 minutes and, perhaps, if she had gone down the hole earlier it may have piqued our interest the build up was just too long and the introduction of the neighbors was of no help.

7768396,1,B01GWCB40Y,"This is not only a terrible adaptation of Neil Gaiman's book, but Gaiman's book is not likely to ""nudge ALICE IN WONDERLAND out of its niche"" (sorry, Diana Wynne Jones).  Selick's Coraline is an unmitigated spoiled brat -- there is nothing likeable or brave about her.  The introduction of a totally unnecessary character, Wybie, is clearly a ploy to get boys interested, since heaven knows they wouldn't want to watch a movie that was just about a girl.  He keeps dropping out of the story, only to be injected again at inappropriate moments so we don't forget about that yes, there's a boy in there. And yes, the boy gets to be the knight who saves the beleaguered maiden at the end because we all know that a girl couldn't possibly rescue herself the way she does in the book.  The movie's graphics are shamelessly derivative (shades of American McGee's Alice in both the tunnel between worlds, many of the interiors and exteriors, and the look and behavior of the cat), and sometimes simply shameless, including a large breasted woman whose pasties look suspiciously like hands rather than shells.  At one point, Selick removes Gaiman's remark by one of the actresses about ""the Scottish play"" -- Shakespeare's Macbeth -- presumably because it would not be understood.  At another point, one of the actresses quotes extensively from Hamlet.  In the book, Coraline's parents are absent-mindedly neglectful; in the movie they are downright nasty, all the way to the end, and frankly, it's hard to believe anyone would want them back.  Why change Mr. Bobo's name to ""Bobinsky"" -- does this make some kind of difference?  Gaiman's whole message ""when you're scared but you still do it anyway, *that's* brave"" is lost in this mish-mosh of who's the brattiest, parents or children?  The constant ""this might just be a dream"" suggestions are straight out of the lamest kind of deus ex machina.  Cliches (""evil witch"" -- via Wizard of Oz; the entire spider web sequence, which does not appear anywhere in the book) and illogical situations abound -- anyone care to explain why Coraline has a fire burning in her real bedroom on which to burn the effigy of her parents?  How this managed to win so many awards only reveals just how low contemporary standards are.  Anything that's not Beavis and Butthead is apparently worthy of an Academy Award nomination these days.",1503705600,2,2363,4.86284289276808

the plot

One summer, Coraline Jones and her parents had just moved into an apartment in an old house called the Pink Palace, found in a rainy old town.  Coraline's parents write for an internet site about gardening for a living and have little to no time to give much attention to Coraline.  On her first day at the Pink Palace, she met a boy named Wybie,  who seems to  annoy her on a regular basis.  The next day, Wybie found an old doll at his grandmother's apartment where he lives that looks just like Coraline, so he gave it to her.

One day, Coraline was craving some needed attention from her parents, but as they were working again, they couldn't afford any time for her.  Her father instead gave her a meaningless chore counting windows and doors in the new apartment just to keep her busy.  She found a small door in the living room that was wallpapered over.  She bugged her mom to help her find out what was behind this small door, and her mom found the key, but when they opened it, there were only bricks behind the closed door.

That night, Coraline went to bed, and decided to go downstairs to the door again, and now when she opened it, she found a portal to another world.  What she finds is a parallel world where her parents give her all the attention she could ever need.  Their whole world revolves around Coraline's happiness.  The only difference in the appearance of her parents in this world, is that instead of eyes, they have black buttons sewn in instead.

Coraline comes back to this world every night, but soon she realizes that this world may have a downside as well.  Something is a little too creepy about her ""other mother"", and Coraline discovered the price of staying in this ideal world would cost her a huge price; Coraline would have to let her ""other mother"" sew buttons into her eyes, so that she would always belong to her forever.  On this side of the door, she has a friend in Wybie and a talking cat; can they help her get back to her real world and to her real parents before the buttons would have to be sewn into her eyes?  Go and buy Coraline on blu-ray and find out.

the breakdown

I find as I write this review that I am a fan of Writer/Director Henry Selick's movies.  I wanted to talk about how Coraline is the best animated film since Disney's James and the Giant Peach, and I find that he directed this favorite as well.  What draws me to films like these is the dark side, the macabre that only something like an animated film can produce if executed the right way.  Of course I noticed the similarities of Coraline characters Ms Spink and Ms Forcible to James and the Giant Peach's Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge, but I thought of it as purely coincidental, but perhaps these types of characters are from the mind of director Henry Selick.

There are also similarities to Alice in Wonderland, in the sense that there is a parallel world that exists through the looking glass, down a rabbit hole or through a small hidden door in the living room.  Yet despite the borrowed concepts, Coraline feels both fresh and new, and it is that mysterious, darker side of these fantasies that always seem to draw me in.

Watching the Making of this movie in one of the extras on the blu-ray is mind blowing.  It is best not to try and wrap your mind around the tedious and monotonous stop-motion filming that when on with the making of a movie like this, yet you have to marvel at the world they have created here.  Coraline is the first stop-motion motion picture that was made for 3D.  The 3D effects (even on this blu-ray) are outstanding and they truly enhance the viewing experience as long as you can endure the possible headache or disorientation that you may experience from sitting through the 100 minutes of movie with your red and blue glasses on.

Coraline has the voice talents of Dakota Fanning and Teri Hatcher mainly as Coraline and mother/other mother. I usually enjoy Fanning's movies very much anyway, but Hatcher has probably been in more dopey movies that I have avoided over the years.  Yet, her creepy other mother voice is very effective and helps keep that edge that Coraline already possesses.  Keith David as the Black Cat (or Wuss Puss) is perfect as he adds that creepy and mysterious feel that The Black Cat possesses in the film.

The trailers of this film did not do this film justice at all.  I wasn't waiting to see this despite that it is so up my alley.  Their seems to be a cult following of a movie like The Nightmare Before Christmas due to it's edgy feel, but in my opinion it's unwarranted especially when Coraline comes around and is finally the real deal.  Yet having said that, in the way that The Nightmare Before Christmas is fine for viewing for any age, Coraline's scary scenes are truly frightening, and may not be suitable for the younger ones around four to seven years old.  If you do decide to sit down with your young ones, explain that there are scary scenes coming and that it's all make believe in advance to soften the dark and scary scenes.  This movie is a safe one to buy to add to your growing blu-ray collection because you'll watch it over and over.

7768423,5,B01GWCB40Y,"This is my 3-year-old granddaughter""s favorite movie ever! (two-year viewing history.} She is attracted to its tractor beam without distraction until the very end every time she watches it.  . . . and, I must admit, I am too. Some people feel the material is too dark for young children, but my little
angel finds it to be a safe perch from which to explore the darker edges of things. It is, after all, a story of natural youthful curiousity and a cautionary tale about the grass on the other side of the fence-- so valuable lessons are taught while reinforcing the concept of feminine self-determination. I'm sure, though, that my little one just sees it as a magical tale of a fabulous world and the gritty heroine who navigates it.",1498003200,,735,4.6106870229007635

7768489,2,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline is a trainwreck of a film that had potential, but lacks the ability to catch the viewer's interest from the start. We witnessed the horror called Coraline unfold before our eyes. Its a dark fantasy film constructed with bad-quality, stop-motion animation. This movie is rated PG and was produced by Laika Entertainment.

Coraline starts out with a family moving to the 150 year old Pink Palace, out in the middle of Ashland, Oregon. The family begins a series of events that are out of the ordinary. First, they find a doll at the doorstep that looks exactly like Coraline and she hauls it around wherever travels take her. She then discovers a hidden door behind the living room wallpaper and Coralines mom unlocks it. Its blocked with bricks until the darkness of night turns it into a magical tunnel that leads to an alternate dimension with the same house and people the difference is that they have buttons for eyes. To find out what happens in this alternate dimension, You will have to watch the movie yourself.

Coraline is a creepy gothic movie meant for young children that lacks interest from start to end. Henry Selick and Neil Gaiman have a great team of animators that have constructed amazing movies such as: The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. This time, the 3D effects are less than impressive and the stop-motion seemed rushed. Dakota Fanning impressively played Coraline but nothing can make up for this trainwreck.

We recommend this odd piece of film for children 10+. It was creepy and not suitable for little children as it can easily give them horrific nightmares even though the rating is PG. The MPAA rating system really underestimated how eerie and frightening this film could be for the target audience, therefore it shouldve been rated PG-13. The movie was atrocious and caused drowsiness after the mid-way point in the movie, and it was a waste of time and money.

Final Rating: 2 out of 5 Stars",1486080000,,1961,4.810089020771513

She has watched all the Star Wars films, all of Harry Potter, Ghostbusters, etc. She never gets scared. But this movie made her literally shake and cry. I didn't make her watch the whole thing, but I left it on in case she wanted to see the end resolution, hoping it would make her feel better.

7768872,5,B01GWCB40Y,"My son and I have loved this movie since we first saw it years ago. He was very young, about 6, yet had absolutely zero problems with the ""creepiness"" of it that other parents had reported of their children. If your child has a skittish disposition then perhaps you should watch it first before watching with your child. This movie has a slight scare level similar to ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"". It certainly didn't deserve the low star ratings some gave it just because their child wasn't developmentally ready for a haunted house story. He's 10 now, and we just bought a digital copy and watched it again twice as our original DVD has long since been worn out. Some of the animation is truly beautiful.

Coraline is very much done in the tradition of old fairy tales which provided scares and thrills along with lessons and entertainment. Kids sometimes like a little adventure and suspense with their entertainment too! Coraline learns to appreciate her parents despite their human flaws (and they certainly should be more attentive parents than they were in the beginning). Coraline gets into trouble in part because her parents were too distracted to be attentive to her needs; that is a reminder for parents watching the movie too. She learns not all things that look good are good or safe and to use her wits in examining situations and people/creatures. She is brave, strong-willed and clever in overcoming an evil situation not only for herself but for many others caught in the web. Frankly I think this is an excellent movie for explaining to watch out for dangerous people and situations in the world without being too literal when kids are old enough not to have nightmares from a somewhat scary story.

7768876,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Loved this movie! I wouldn't recommend for younger kids, thought. It was pretty dark for a children's movie. If you're in to dark, spooky movies, I think you'd love it. (It's actually based off of a horror book!)",1471910400,,212,4.605263157894737
7768877,4,B01GWCB40Y,"This movie is a favorite of a lot of my favorite people. For some reason, I had never gotten around to it until now.

  Coraline is a blend of fairy tale, Twilight Zone weirdness and David Cronenburg style horror. It is a well crafted, psychological tale pieced together from Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella and The Naked Lunch. Technically, it is marvelous. The stop motion animation and models are nothing short of astounding.

  I'm sure that every reviewer warns that this movie isn't for all kids. There is little violence and no gore, but this is a movie that rather shockingly attacks children's most basic fears. What happens to Coraline's Dad (sort of) is really awful. In fact, it reminds me of Videodrome, for those in the know.

  Coraline also deftly uses adult horror tropes like needles, psychosexual imagery and eye horror. Maybe I'm off here, but my guess is that small children will be horrified, but not really know exactly why. This is a movie that is  a big step up from Monster House and Nightmare Before Christmas, intensitywise. I personally would show this to some ten year olds, but no one younger. Be aware.

  For everyone else, this is a visually arresting, engaging movie. It is big on wows and a little short on plot, but all together a very fun and unique experience. Buy this movie for your niece who is into Chvrches and Creepypasta.",1471910400,10,1367,4.717299578059071

But still, even though there is not even a spec of blood or gore it seems to... shake something. On the other hand I love how disturbing it is, a very I-want-to-look-away-but-I-can't kind of disturbing. Very whimsical too. Adults and kids alike would love this movie. However in my personal opinion, if you are easily scared, I would give this a 9+ rating for age.",1469145600,,521,4.22
7768974,5,B01GWCB40Y,"My grandchildren have seen this movie so many times.  I can't believe they rented it again!  This is the story of a little girl named Coraline. Her parents are both too busy to spend a lot of time with her. One day she finds her way to ""another world"" where the mother and father are very attentive and very kind to her.  These new parents have button eyes.  The story takes us through Coraline's adventures until she realizes that all is not as it seems with these new parents with button eyes.  My nine year old grandchild has been watching this move since she is about 5 or 6 and she absolutely loves it.  On the other hand, my 7 year old granddaughter doesn't like ""scary movies"" and gets scared every time she watches this movie.  It isn't that she doesn't like the movie. It is just that once Caroline discovers what is up with her new button eyed parents, it becomes a bit scary. Just be careful if you have little ones who are easily scared.",1469059200,8,949,4.327683615819209

7769105,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I love Neil Gaiman, I have many of his books (the Graveyard Book is a favorite of mine) and just recently re-read Coraline. The book is good, it has some nice morals and messages; bravery doesn't mean you're not scared, things are not always what they seem, don't judge people, etc. I also like that it has unsettling moments that Coraline must work through and an end game to figure out. She realizes what is important in life as ""a girl who is small for her age"".

Having said that, the movie is amazing to me. It's a haunting mix of music and atmosphere that captures my attention every time. I much prefer the movie to the book in this case.

Neil Gaiman has a peculiar writing style that can be a bit erratic sometimes but Henry Selick does an interesting job of filling in the gaps. He kept all the principal characters, many of the conversations verbatim and the plot but gave it a fun and different edge while keeping true to the heart of the story. Even Neil Gaiman himself has said it's marvelous and the house in Selick's vision was the house Gaiman wrote of.

Books don't seamlessly translate into movies, there has to be some creative glue to hold it together for the audience. Henry Selick is talented at realizing someone else's story, look what he did for Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas.",1460073600,,1312,4.527426160337553

7769269,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I continue to lash out at the naysayers who still
feel that there's nothing to benefit from 3D in the
home.  Perhaps they would think differently if just
having watched Universal's Blu-ray release of Coraline,
whose 3D presentation clearly solidifies the worth
of this format.

Henry Selick may not be a household name but he
is the director of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before
Christmas.  Mr. Selick, 16 years later, is responsible
for writing and directing Coraline, a film that in many
respects surpasses Tim Burton's classic with an
outstanding screenplay and the enhancement of 3D.

...and I am really kicking myself here.  I regret that
I never had the opportunity to see this film theatrically
or during its initial Blu-ray release.  Possibly that turned
out to be a good thing as watching this remarkable film
unfold before me in glorious 3D has been nothing short
of a wonderful, stunning experience.

The story is about Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota
Fanning), a highly imaginative young girl who has
just moved to a new apartment located within a large,
old creepy house.  Coraline's world is lonely.  Her Mother
and Father (voiced by Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman)
are too busy to spend time with her.  The only person
she remotely considers herself close to is a hunchbacked boy
named Wyborn (voiced by Robert Bailey, Jr.) who is
more nuisance than friend.

Upon entering a small hidden door within her home,
Coraline enters a parallel world where all the things
that were wrong become right.  Suddenly she finds
herself with her ""other Mother and Father"" who shower
her with love and attention.  However, she soon finds
that this new world of hers is anything but perfect.

Coraline is an entangled story with characters that
evoke a great range of emotions. As I sat and watched
this film I couldn't help but be in awe of the complexity
of the story.  What kind of mind thinks up this kind of
stuff?  What has been created here is no doubt going
to become a classic, timeless tale.

The 3D Blu-ray presentation is something soon not
forgotten.  Where image quality is at its most importance
this 1080p transfer does not disappoint with its razor
sharpness.  Don't be put off by the muted colors within
Coraline's drab world.  Once she enters her parallel
universe it's as if someone switched on the light switch
and suddenly the entire screen fills with beautiful neon-like
coloration.  Black levels here are excellent adding nice
texture to the picture.

There's an astonishing level of depth that provides a
constant WOW 3D experience.  The film was specifically
choreographed for 3D with all its elements strategically
placed within the landscape to give a dazzling and
impressive visual presentation from start to finish.
There were just too many moments that I sat in my
viewing seat thinking how superb the 3D looks.

There are quite a few ""In Yo face moments"" that are
finely executed including one very impressive moment
at the very beginning of the film involving a needle and
thread --- but that's just beginning --- as there are many
moments where objects such as fingers or buzzing
dragonflies seemingly leap off the screen and hover
inches from the viewer.

It's unfortunate that this near perfect presentation is
marred by ghosting that at first is very limited to sequences
where Caroline is crossing through the tunnel.  However,
I found that in the film's final 30 minutes there was a more
constant presence of double imaging in part due to the
limited amount of lighting used.  I am not going to let this
issue ruin the overall score I will give it because I am well
aware that ghosting issues will vary with different brands
of hardware.

The DTS-MA 5.1 soundtrack is superb.  I found most of
the sound emphasized through the front soundstage with
dialogue that comes across very clear without being
overshadowed by the film's dreamy, eerie musical score
courtesy of composer Bruno Coulais.  Sound levels are
so perfectly matched that the smallest nuances of effect
noise are pronounced ever so clearly.  The rears provide
a nice amount of ambient effect noise including wind,
thunder, rain and various creaking noises.",1453075200,,4156,4.90271816881259

We watched it last night and my daughter was mesmerized.  She had already watched some ""making of"" clips and was very excited about watching the movie.  I can see where younger children might be scared by this movie, but my daughter understands that it's just a story and the characters are just puppets.  However, I did tease her that I would send her to her ""other mother"" if she didn't behave. This movie is great for all ages as both my daughter and I enjoyed it along with my Dad.

7769396,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Have you ever wished you could crawl into an alternate universe where all your dreams will come true? Well before you decide thats what you want you should watch Coraline.
Coraline is an animated horror/fantasy movie. It was directed and screen written by Henry Selick. It was released on February 6, 2009; it was filmed in Portland Oregon (USA). The run time is 100 minutes long, I can watch Coraline at home because I own the movie. I know every word, sound, bang, and crash in that movie. The acting quality is very good, the voices of the characters fit very well with the actors/actresses playing them. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie, it is my all-time favorite! Its funny, freaky, and actually a very good learning experience. I give it a 10 out of 10 because its just an amazing movie.
Coraline is about a girl who moves from Michigan to Oregon; she is lonely she finds a little door and behind the door it is all bricked up, but during the night the bricks disappear, and it turns into a passage way to a parallel universe; a world where people have buttons for eyes, caring parent, good new friends, to a place where all of her dreams can come true. But she shouldnt get comfortable because her other mother (in the parallel universe) tells her she can stay forever but when coralline refuses she finds out that the alternate reality was just a trap to lure her in.
Everything may not always be as it seems. Before you go crawling into an alternate universe hoping all your dreams will come true you need to watch Coraline",1441238400,,1547,4.5285714285714285

In this sense, I was familiar with the story~line. My 7 year-old-niece & 9 year-old-nephew loved it. Especially, my niece who told me~ fast forward it to the ""evil parts"" with ""the other mother!!!""

Keep in mind, if you have kids who are innocent/simply don't like Spiders....They WILL be terrified or have nightmares about secret rooms, which lead to ""other mothers"" and ""other fathers."" However, if they like ""scary"" movies, are more mature for their age, and/or can handle strange visuals...

7769437,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I love this movie. Alice in wonderland (1951) is my favorite. But, this is so close. I watched the 3D version that I didn't know was on here. It was strange with out having 3D equipment. Kinda tinted & a strain on my eyes after. Still had great HD moments.

I haven't seen the regular blu ray version yet. But, I can only imagine it's great. I'm sure everyone knows the story. Girl goes through a door to a ""better"" world. But, deception takes many faces. I'll focus on why I have watched this over & over.

The art direction is truly amazing. The mix of CGI & what looks like stop motion clay is perfected. Imagine nightmare before Christmas in HD, with a darker (& less holiday) theme. The music is simple, and sets the tone very well. The characters all play a important part in the movie & they're so zany, without going slapstick.

The story is easy to sum up. But, watching it unfold really sucks you in. It's scary, it's unsettling, it hits on so many feelings, but, some of the best emotional moments are very subtle. It holds some great moral lessons about trust, and perspective. It's story & art direction just blend into one experience that vaguely reminds me of Alice. I'll keep watching this for a long time for sure. 11/10

Now to buy a time machine to see it in theaters. Are those on Ebay or Amazon?",1438041600,,1316,4.359183673469388

Only parents know their children well enough to decide the appropriate age for this admittedly creepy, but not terrifying, film. As a kid, it would have scared me! LOL I like that they never explain the supernatural goings on or the origin of the Beldam (Other Mother), you're left with the feeling that it's just one of those things from childhood that an adult would never understand or believe anyway. It feels like the wisdom of the very old and the very young, one of those things you forget, to your own detriment, when you hit the teenage years.",1428537600,,624,4.724770642201835

The chunky naked ladies swinging around, was the ""feather"" that broke the camel's back.  Characters need to keep their clothes on in kids movies (and adult movies really, but especially kids movies).  Ridiculous!  What was the point of that? (That was a rhetorical question).

Some time later we purchased a 3D version on DVD, which included a few pairs of those old-fashioned colored paper glasses, and that was actually pretty cool! Then came the advent of Blue-Ray 3D technology and not long after, our purchase of a 3D TV and Blue-Ray player. Looking for Christmas gifts last month, I wondered if Coraline had been released on Blue-Ray 3D. As there are currently several versions of this movie available, it took a fair amount of searching before finding this genuine Blue-Ray 3D version, and at a pretty good price! It looks and sounds pretty glorious on a Blue-Ray equipped 3D TV with a Surround Sound system, with such excellent detail that you can almost feel the textures.

7769955,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Welcome to the Pink Palace Apartments, actually a converted Victorian house, each floor rented to a different tenant. It's fall, and Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved in. On her second day it's raining buckets outside, so she's stuck exploring the house, Coraline finds a miniature hidden door in the living room. But it's walled up with brick. So what is going on when a ring of paper mice invite her through it in the middle of the night?

She crawls through this undulating blue tunnel and comes out - in her living room? But its not her REAL living room, because in the kitchen she finds her other mother. And in the parlor is her other father. Exactly the same as her real parents except they have button eyes. And her real mom doesn't have time to cook while her other mom makes her a wonderful supper. And her real dad doesn't have time to play and her other dad is a blast to hang out with. And when it's time for bed, she goes up to find her bedroom beautifully decorated instead of the bare minimum of her unpacked real room. It is definitely not too good to be true, as far as Coraline is concerned. So she is rather disappointed when she wakes up in her real bed.

Now you and I know that something can be too good to be true, but Coraline has to figure it out. And figure it she does. This is a girl with spunk - and she's going to need it because there is something terribly terribly wrong with her other mother. Or terribly wicked.

I enjoyed this stop-motion animated movie. It is based on the short novel of the same name by Neil Gaiman:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coraline/dp/0380807343/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coraline</a>

As with the book, the movie gives you this feeling that something is off-kilter, even in the real world. This partly comes from the characters themselves, such as the decidedly odd Miss' Spink and Forrible in the basement flat. They have stuffed all their dear departed Scottish terriers and dressed them as angels.

And it also comes from the great movie score, which is just weird enough to make your skin prickle.

The movie adds stuff that is not in the book, not surprisingly as the book is short. But it leaves out an important part of the original story. The Other Mother leaves a doll, which looks like Coraline except for black button eyes, to take her place so her real parents don't notice her absence. As tool of Other Mother, this is not a benign friendly doll.

In short, I liked both the movie version and the original book of ""Coraline"". The book, though, is genuinely creepier. ""There's no place like home"" with a sinister cast.

Our tween heroine is quirky, flawed, but relatable, and she grows as a person by the end. The pacing is perhaps a little choppy, but there is so much to look at that you might not notice. This movie is beautifully animated (as long as you like stop-motion) and does a better job of creating creepy atmosphere than many movies geared towards adults. With that said, it earns its PG rating and isn't really meant for very young or sensitive children. It's suspenseful, and the fantasy elements are more Hans Christian Andersen than Walt Disney.

The idea of a child finding a hidden door to an alternate reality where everything is a little too good to be true might be a bit heavy for some younger viewers.,1414540800,,302,4.574074074074074

7770188,4,B01GWCB40Y,"The movie is great. I love the story, the setting, the mystical vibe, and the visual effects. I've always been a fan of stop-motion animation and practical effects and they're great in this movie. It's interesting because it's almost like a horror film for kids. It doesn't scare me, but I could see it scaring younger viewers.

I bought it new. It arrived very quickly but when the DVD arrived to my house, the disc would move around the inside of the case and was difficult to get to stay in place after putting it back. It doesn't seem like anything is broken on the inside, so I don't know if that's the fault of the seller or just sub-par DVD case design. That honestly doesn't ruin the experience for me, but I buy my DVDs new to avoid getting a scratched up disc and it not staying in place in it's case makes it more likely to get scratched.

Either way, I would recommend the film for those who are interested in this kind of thing.",1414281600,,941,4.3107344632768365
7770189,5,B01GWCB40Y,"This is a rather creepy tale about a young girl who is dissatisfied with her home life. She has recently moved into a remote house surrounded by kooky neighbors. Her parents are always involved in their lives but seem to ignore her and she finds herself literally alone, until she finds a key that leads her through a smaller hidden door into another world where she finds a duplicate set of parents that are eager to grant her every wish and give her the attention she craves. At first, it seems like a dream come true, but soon, she finds a hidden price to this land and the being that controls everything will stop at nothing to add Coraline to her collection, even to kidnapping her real parents. It's up to Coraline to unravel the mystery and find a way to stop the witch from claiming her -and save her real parents.

7770207,2,B01GWCB40Y,"There seemed to be a spate of macabre kids movies that all came out around the same time. Coraline was one of them if I'm not mistaken. Coraline is creative, well-executed and basically ticks those boxes for a macabre-doll creepiness. My 2-stars is really to add a little more balance to the way-over-the-top 4-5 star reviews Amazon has recently been serving up. Normally, I'd say it's a 3. This is pretty clearly a kid's movie so I'm rating it as such. To summarize, it's a bit too dark for young viewers in spots. Yes, I get that kids are soft these days yada yada. But my kids, 8yo and 5yo wanted this movie OFF towards the end.

Speaking of the star-ratings. On Amazon Prime Video, I now assume a negative 1-1.5 star bias. So for example, if a movie is supposed to be a 4.5. It's likely a 3.5 or even a 3.",1413763200,3,809,4.287581699346405

I viewed the case furthermore to find many more scratches among the outside of the case as well. So I open it up and immediately notice that the primary disc shows especially obvious wear and even a small selection of scratches as well. Disc two looked completely untouched, along with a slip maintaining the digital copy code and an unopened 2-pack of 3D glasses. I found this particularly odd, but nonetheless, wear and damage of the outside case and the primary disc, being the highlight of this bundle, is COMPLETELY unacceptable, especially granted I bought this as a ""new"" item. This product had CLEARLY been used and re-shrink-wrapped, and not only watched once or twice, but very clearly showing wear of multiple watches and love. My own DVDs are in better shape than the quality this primary disc shows. How pathetic. An exchange option was not available among my return request, so it looks like I'm making a return.

The one thing that really bothered me was adding a boy character to help Coraline. Coraline doesn't need any help. She's strong. Just because she's a girl doesn't mean she needs a boy's help.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: In the tradition of the Brothers Grimm and the stop-motion animation style of my childhood, 'CORALINE 3D' is a much more serious film than the trailers would have us believe. There's no way around this other than to write that the film is a children's tale not really meant for children. Teetering between fantasy and horror, the nightmare-inducing puppetry is only half of the scare factor. The other half, and arguably its best feature, is a story that is actually creepy and frightening - something that's sadly missing from modern horror in general. Henry Selick, the director of 'The Nightmare before Christmas' brings life to Neil Gaiman's award-winning novella, with a stunning visual mastery that somehow makes all the grotesque imagery rather attractive and captivating.

Feeling bored and neglected, Coraline [Dakota Fanning] decides to explore her new apartment while her parents [Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman] continue in their time-consuming work. Walking the grounds, she meets the odd Wybie [Robert Bailey, Jr.], the two eccentric downstairs neighbours [Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French], and the Russian gymnast who lives upstairs [Ian McShane]. Back inside the house, she discovers a mysterious secret door that leads to a parallel universe much like her own. Only there, everyone at the Pink Palace Apartments lives to endlessly provide and entertain her. But soon, the black buttons, which serve as their eyes in this world, give way to more sinister intentions. With the help of a talking black cat [Keith David], Coraline must defeat the grasps of this ""other world"" and get back home.

There are no surprises or twists in the plot and it's all very familiar ground, in fact, but 'CORALINE 3D' is nonetheless a loving tribute to the art of filmmaking itself. We're not watching the story as much as musing and gawking at the beautiful artistry that went into blending the charming and delightful with the creepy and frightful. There is such a great amount of attention placed on the details that it becomes almost trance-like, and it all works to enhance the narrative. We don't need anyone to explain that Coraline's parents are busy. They just are. We learn more about the downstairs women by looking at pictures and their collection of taxidermy Scottish Terriers. And watching the world of her Other Mother change appearance is scarier than requiring an explanation for her existence.

Again, this may be more than what younger viewers can handle, despite giving the impression of being a children's movie. All the same, the film does arrive with the unsurprising and inevitable moral conclusion typical of the genre. And this is not so much a hindrance as it is expected five minutes into the movie. No matter, 'CORALINE 3D' knows how to play its cards right and lives up to that cautionary proverb we grew up hearing from parents and now repeat to our own children: ""Be careful what you wish for."" With an animation style that's both adventurous and strange, Henry Selick's newest work of art is very much a modern-day fairy tale and one which will only grow in appreciation with time. It's fanciful, imaginative, and contemplative. But it's also weird, eccentric and even freakish. A really terrific mix for a fun 3D animation film.

Not since 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' has an animated film been so visually captivating. But rather than repeating the success of its predecessor, Henry Selick's 'CORALINE 3D [2009] gives audiences a darker undertone, where wish-fulfilment suddenly turn into true a nightmare. It's a beautifully immersive experience about a young girl learning to be clever, resourceful, and mature about her outlook on life. Only, parents, be sure that the little tykes can handle some of the film's more disturbing aspects.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Almost two years since 'CORALINE 2D' first appeared in high definition, Pictures UK now brings the highly-imaginative stop-motion film to the 3D realm. The results are terrific though not quite the knockout experience I expected and not without some minor issues along the way. On the other hand, the majority of the 1080p encoded image runtime is strong and a great treat for the eyes. Presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the picture arrives with pitch-perfect contrast levels, providing wonderful clarity and visibility of things in the distance as well as in close-ups. The finest details are stunningly consistent and distinctly sharp. Textures in various objects are remarkable and incredibly lifelike, which seem to jump out of the screen in many scenes. From individual threads in articles of clothing to separate strands of hair atop each character, everything is crystal clear and superbly detailed. Colours possess an extraordinary pop and energy in spite of the darkened lenses of the shutter glasses. Whether we're in the drab and drained real world or the vibrantly exciting universe of Other Mother's house, the diverse palette on display is vividly saturated and accurate. Blacks are inky and profound with excellent delineation in the darkest shadows. The reason for going over to the 3D version is that the image has now added with a few awesome gimmick shots thrown in for good measure. Some of the best moments are when Coraline enters the little door and crawls through the colourful tube into Other Mother's world. Also, the last half-hour of the movie as that world is slowly dissolving away is when the Blu-ray really shines in terms of three-dimensional depth. So all in all the 'CORALINE 3D' is still a fantastic presentation sure to make many fans and 3D enthusiasts happy with the picture quality.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack arrives with resounding clarity, precision, and depth, the sound mix is impressive as it reaches the higher pitches without a loss in detail and an active surround presence that is at a near constant. The front soundstage is expansive and evenly balanced with crystalline dialogue reproduction and wonderful transparency. Atmospheric effects and non-directional cues are sharp and fluid, enveloping the listener convincingly. Interior scenes exhibit terrific spaciousness and acoustics, generating an amazing environment that's eerily authentic. The original score by Bruno Coulais and They Might Be Giants is warm and inviting, using the entire system to draw the audience into this fantastical world. Low bass is richly polish and responsive, adding a palpable realism to each scene and musical number. Accompanying the great 3D picture quality of 'Coraline 3D' is that the track is simply amazing, offering audiences a terrific and immersive aural experience that matches perfectly the fantastical elements of the film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Henry Selick and Composer Bruno Coulais: Director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais discuss various aspects of the film's production, from adapting Neil Gaiman's novella, cast choices, LAIKA's extraordinary animation work, and of course, the musical score. The commentary is fairly standard, offering information you can find elsewhere in the package, but the affability of the two men keeps it from being utterly boring and maintains interest.

Deleted Scenes [2009] [9:00] With brief introductions from Henry Selick, this collection arrives with finished animation and voiceovers, which was a nice surprise. Only two scenes were actually removed from the final product, while the rest are mostly extended sequences that really don't affect the narrative either way. Still, they're interesting to watch for anyone curious.

Special Feature: The Making of Coraline [2009] [36:00] There are no surprises in this informative documentary that examines different areas of the film's pre-production and its end result. Henry Selick hosts the majority of the runtime with behind-the-scenes footage showing the cast in recording sessions and the creative team working on the animation. Viewers have a choice of either watching the feature in its entirety or selecting specific areas as individual short segments. Other contributors are Neil Gaiman, Maddy Gaiman, Tom Proost, Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Saunders, Teri Hatcher, Dawn French, John Hodgman, Georgina Hayns, Jeremy Spake, Suzanne Moulton, Deborah Cook, Lee Bo Henry and Matt Sanders.

Special Feature: Voicing the Characters [2009] [11:00] A self-explanatory documentary that has Henry Selick and the cast members talking about their experiences working on the film, the various characters, and developing unique voices for each. Other contributors are Keith David, Dakota Fanning, Dawn French, Teri Hatcher, John Hodgman, Ian McShane and Jennifer Saunders.

Special Feature: Creepy Coraline [1080p] [6:00] Author Neil Gaiman and director Henry Selick host this rather short look at the film's unique and grim visual elements. Honestly, this is an okay documentary, but it's very brief and easy to sit through.

D-Box Motion Code: This feature is for folks who can afford D-Box Integrated Motion Systems.

Finally, taking audiences into a world where wishes become nightmares, 'CORALINE 3D' is the newest animated film from visionary director Henry Selick. Adapted from the novella by imaginative author Neil Gaiman, the film is a splendid and astounding visual delight with a narrative that's genuinely - and appreciably - terrifying, one that may not work well with younger viewers. The 3D Blu-ray edition arrives with great awesome picture quality, despite a few minor drawbacks in the presentation. The high-resolution audio remains the same awesome experience as before for an animated feature, and the supplemental package mirrors its predecessor. Only those willing to make the jump into the 3D realm will want to add this to their collection, while owners of the previous 2D version will be sort of satisfied with their original purchase, but I feel you are losing a hell of a lot in not going for the 3D awesome experience, which are absolutely stunning and this 3D Blu-ray is such an honour to add to my Blu-ray Collection, as every time I view this 3D Blu-ray, I see other stuff I missed before. Very Highly Recommended!

The part that made me never want to watch it again, was the part where they show two very old actresses doing a strip tease.  If this movie was meant for adults, the rating should have indicated that.  If it was meant for children, then a buxom old lady wearing hot pants and pasties is highly inappropriate.",1404172800,10,485,4.228260869565218

7770307,5,B01GWCB40Y,"It's a great dark story that can help you reevaluate your life to have a better appreciation for the things you have. Its use of color to visually trick, not just the main character, but the audience as well (if you haven't read the book), is a good way of showing the simple point that things are not always as they seem or even looks can be deceiving. It's style is somewhat Burton-esque, but again, that is deceiving.",1403740800,,420,4.397435897435898

7770309,1,B01GWCB40Y,"First of all, as a 2D movie, it rocks.
However, this is not Real 3D, nor Active 3D.
  You have to use these green/magenta glasses, which destroys the colors in the film. My partner & I decided to switch to the 2D not the old school 3D. I hope someday the distributer/ film maker sells the 3D Passive film that was shown in theaters. Otherwise, this a great film.

After a while you stop judging it and begin to realize that there are so many hidden concepts to this movie. I have watched it countless times and I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate it. The film was also made beautifully, and all the details were painstakingly handmade. I just found out it took them seven years to make. SEVEN YEARS! As a huge fan of Neil Gaiman and the book Coraline, watching this was not disappointing at all. The way the book was brought to life is beyond words. Try to watch for all those hidden little details in the movie! I see something new each time I watch it. You won't find another movie like it.",1401753600,,789,4.266666666666667

7770341,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I am an adult (married with children) and yet I absolutely ADORED this extremely original and brilliant film. When we saw it in cinema, my then 9 years old daughter liked it a lot too, even if she found it a little bit creepy and scary - but I will definitely wait until my younger daughter is at least 9 before watching it with her, because this film is TOO creepy and scary for little kids.

11 years old Coraline Jones moves with her parents to the Pink Palace, a dilapidated mansion renovated into an apartment building somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Oregon. Occupants of two other apartments are two old ladies, who are more than a little bit odd and an archi-eccentric Russian acrobat, Mr. Bobinsky. As if those three strange characters were not enough Coraline meets Wyborn (God, what a name to give to your kid!), the grandson of the landlady, a boy roughly her age - who is every inch as odd as other people around and whom she dislikes instantly. With her parents working all time and no company Coraline is very unhappy and bored and tries to kill some time by exploring - it is then that she discovers a small door sealed off by a brick wall... And then the film really begins.

The quality of the scenario, dialogs and images in this film is simply stellar! I was really taken by the story and impressed by the visual aspect of the movie. I must however once again stress the point, that this is a CREEPY thing, more in the line of classical (fairly brutal and cruel) fairytales of Brothers Grimm, than of Disney films. There are some genuinely scary moments which made my 9 years old daughter uncomfortable - and I am certain that any 5 years old kid will freak out during those scenes and then make nightmares about them...

With just that little parental warning included, I must say that ""Coraline"" is amongst the most impressive films I ever saw. This is indeed - and I measure my words here - a MASTERPIECE of cinema. To buy, watch and keep. Enjoy - and always be very careful what you wish for...)))",1397001600,2,2026,4.440860215053763

The movie is a sufficiently creepy moral tale about 1) maybe not constantly ignoring your kids so they don't go looking for affection elsewhere, and 2) maybe forgiving your parents for forgetting how awesome you are to be with sometimes.  It was the first (and hopefully only) film we have shown our younger kid that was obviously too much (my younger is nearly 6).  There were questions and more questions and more questions for about three days.  For the record, it was NOT my idea to show the film to the kids.  It was my 8 year old's idea, so of course the younger one wanted in.  :)  At the end of the day the nearly 6 said it was a really good movie, but how *did* that cat do all that stuff?

Lessons we start to teach our children when they're at, or around, the same age as the main character - Coraline. The situations and events that transpire, make it all too easy for adults to recognize the inevitable outcomes & morals taught. However, the target audience, pre-teen children I'd imagine, take a little more time before they start to catch on. This is a family movie of course as well; there is something in it for every age group in the household, including the adults haha. The story is very enjoyable, a lot of fun, and ""educational"" in ways! Last, but certainly not the least, the effects, & animation itself as a whole are breath-taking. As are most all, ""stop-clay"" (I think that's the correct term), animation films. For those of you who are not familiar on how they create movies like Coraline, Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, etc. Please Google it if you get the chance - It'll bring a whole new light of enjoyment to these films when watching them, after you know how they are made. This film is on it's way, if not already, a ""cult"" classic, and is a definite must-see for everyone, at least once!

7770385,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I wish Amazon did not lump reviews of all the different DVD and Bluray, 2D and 3D versions of this movie together. This is a great movie but if you are looking for the 3D format that was seen in the theaters (and will require a 3D TV and 3D Bluray player), make sure you are getting the right one. The product descriptions can be confusing and it is unusual to see an Anaglyph 3D Bluray.

In 2011, I bought the 2D/3D Bluray that required blue/red glasses (4 pair included) to view the 3D version. That older 3D technology version (Anaglyph) is not worth watching in my opinion, though the 2D version included is fine.

I do love the movie and about 6 months later I ended up replacing the Anaglyph Bluray with the OTHER 3D Bluray version (requiring a 3D TV and 3D Bluray player). This is the version I am giving 5 stars to. I consider this a must see for 3D enthusiasts and it also contains the 2D version.",1390262400,2,906,4.261627906976744
7770386,4,B01GWCB40Y,"First off, this is not a cartoon. I've seen many reviewers describe this as a cartoon and that is incorrect. Simply, a cartoon is a segment of many two-dimensional illustrated pieces of art placed together in an effort to give the illusion of motion. Coraline is built entirely in a 3d physical space with the use of models, set design pieces & real lighting using a technique called Stop Motion photography - characters are moved a fraction of an inch and a frame is shot on film (or digitally).

Think of it as a diorama that acts like an alternate world where specific characters exist. As such, the breadth it takes, not to mention the patience of the artists, is a phenomenal endeavor. Stop Motion photography has been around for a long time now - Gumby, TV Christmas specials such as Rudolph - but you've never seen anything like this before.

At first glance, one would associate Coraline with Tim Burton because of the design of the characters, the creepy atmosphere and the storyline but this film is actually directed by Henry Selick. I wish Selick would get more recognition - Selick also directed The Nightmare Before Christmas, from a story by Burton and lots of help from Burton and yet most people would swear Burton also wore the Director's hat. Selick also directed James & The Giant Peach so it's safe to say he has perfected the craft of stop motion with a spectacular team of artists, of course.

The film is based on a book by Neil Gaiman and although it's faithful in tone and theme. The one major addition to the film is a character named Wybie - a sidekick of sorts to Coraline. Formats between books and films are different and some theories regarding this addition range between making the film longer to allowing Coraline (independent in spirit) to team up and rid the world of the witch (Other Mother).

The story is beautiful and I personally recommend it to any parent with kids, more so any parents of girls because Coraline is a positive role model embodying strength. She pushes on through challenges becoming self-reliant and reaching maturity. And can you believe she does it all without breaking into song and dance??? Ha ha, okay - there is one character that breaks into song but it isn't Coraline.

Regarding the creepy and horror factors - it's easy to slip into the magical world and believe this domain to be real. If your child is that impressionable and cannot differentiate reality from fantasy, then I suggest a viewing when they're older.  Having said that, kids are resilient and this is no more violent than the average action film kids are exposed to - there are no gun shootings, nobody explodes, no one falls into the engine of an airplane, etc. etc. If anything, Coraline facilitates an opportunity to have a discussion afterwards about the complications of growing up - if you want to turn Friday night into a lecture.

The actors all turn in great performances and the music perfectly captures the many moods of the film. I watched the film in 3D at the theaters and although the colors were a bit muted, the 3d effect was dazzling! I can't comment on whether the home 3d effect is on par but the good news is that the 2D version stands on its own.

If you liked The Nightmare Before Christmas, you will definitely enjoy Coraline. I also recommend the film ParaNorman and look forward to Selick's new film The Shadow King. Be on the look out for it! :)",1389916800,7,3407,4.629139072847682
7770387,5,B01GWCB40Y,"My (almost) 9 year old granddaughter has never watched horror movies.  But, recently, she saw some episodes of Shark Week and she even caught a few scenes of The Walking Dead a couple of times as I viewed them on my DVR during a Saturday afternoon when she was supposed to be outside with her friends.  Still, she wasn't scared of either.  However, when it came to this movie, she was very scared during some parts.  Perhaps it was the music and/or the voices of the characters (aka, the ""fake Mom""), but there were certain scenes that truly did frighten her.  In fact, the first time she (attempted) to watch it, she couldn't get through it... she asked me to stop the movie.  Recently, after many months passed, she asked to watch it again... but asked me to watch it with her.  I did... but I saw that she struggled through some parts, so I would chime in and try to liven things up and remind her it was only a movie... a cartoon, at that.  This is definitely not a movie she'll want to watch by herself, but she did enjoy it.  I suggest you proceed with caution.

7770417,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Every now and then a film adaptation of a beloved book comes along that not only supplements the original material, but in many ways improves upon it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coraline/dp/0380807343/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coraline</a>&nbsp;began as a novella by Neil Gaiman, a creepy and twisted fairy tale that told of a young girl who discovers a little door in her new house, one that leads to a beautiful and wondrous world ruled over by her Other Mother, a woman who in all ways resembles her real mother save for the fact that she has buttons for eyes. Attentive and loving, Coraline's Other Mother urges her to stay in the fantasy world that she's built for her, filled with dancing mice and delicious food and magical toys.

Naturally, Coraline learns the hard way that you should be careful what you wish for. It's a relatively short but potent story, drawing upon ancient folklore in order to shape several facets of the plot, and which excels in seeing the world through the eyes of a child. Tapping into our most primal fears of darkness, isolation, abandonment and wicked parents, the story was ripe for adaptation, particularly through the medium of stop-motion animation.

Director Henry Selick (who also directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas/dp/B005ZMTYBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>) melds Gaiman's characters and plot with his own visual brilliance, making ""Coraline"" an exceptional work of art as well as an engrossing story, and it's fascinating to see the ways in which he expands and explores Gaiman's original plot. Coraline is a little older in the film than in the book, and the entire story is transported from England to America, but the film puts a greater emphasis on her relationship with her parents, her belligerent attitude in moving house, and on the Other Mother's attempts to ""bait the trap"" before trying to convince Coraline to stay.

Perhaps the most interesting difference is the inclusion of Wybie, the grandson of the owner of the house where Coraline and her parents stay. Because much of the book is conveyed through Coraline's internal dialogue, Wybie was invented for the film in order to gave her someone to share exposition with. Somewhat controversially, his presence also puts a new spin on the final confrontation between Coraline and the Other Mother's disembodied hand, one that I can't help but feel played out better in the book.

But both versions of the story complement each other wonderfully, something that only a handful of book-to-film adaptations manage to achieve (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-Bride/dp/B000VEPL2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess Bride</a>&nbsp;is another that comes to mind). The pain-staking process of stop-motion animation means that every minute of screen-time was months in the making, resulting in a truly astounding visual experience. The technical skill that goes into creating Coraline and the world she lives in is nothing short of incredible, with a level of complexity in movement and expression that is seldom seen in this medium.

The film also adds plenty of its own little touches. The Other Mother noticeably never eats any of the food that she lays before Coraline. The first plants that Coraline notices in the garden are pitcher plants, which lure insects in with their sweet-smelling nectar before trapping and devouring them. The Other Father's playful song that he performs for Coraline is laden with a hidden warning: ""we will never take our eyes off Coraline!"" You could watch this movie a dozen times and find some new detail every time.

The voice work is also top-notch, particularly in Dakota Fanning providing a spunky (if a little bratty) Coraline and Keith David's melodious tones bringing to life the black cat that aids our heroine on her quest. But perhaps Terri Hatcher is the biggest surprise; best known for fairly light-weight roles, here she manages the sarcastic and weary droll of Coraline's real mother, and the sugary sweet refrain of her Other Mother...at least until things take a turn for the scary.

Speaking of which, you might want to think twice before leaving your child alone with this movie. It can be immensely dark and scary at times - even for adults! But ultimately, it's a great adaptation of an equally great book, drawing upon all the best that the oldest fairy tales have to offer: a brave heroine, a scary monster, a threefold trial, and a happy ending. It's one of my favourite movies, certainly my favourite stop-motion animated movie, and has a rewatchable quality to it that ensures it'll never grow old.",1385510400,,4779,5.441295546558704

The film's protagonist is often snarky and rude, which isn't the same as being self-confident.

Eventually I let my 5-year-old watch it too (during the day) and she had no problems with the scary parts.  She was also too young to understand what exactly was going on, but for older children you better be prepared to have a lengthy discussion about death and the afterlife.
As for myself, it was kind of silly-weird, but I enjoyed watching it.

Coraline finds the remains of three children who have been kidnapped, disfigured, and murdered inside her house.

7770458,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I had originally seen this movie in the theater with my wife. I really liked the story. It was definitely different, and has that Tim Burton touch mixed with Hayao Miyazaki's style (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, etc - if you have not heard or seen any of Hayao Miyazaki's movies - check them out - AMAZING!). Some people say Coraline is ok for all ages, but it is not in my opinion. Even as an adult, there are parts of this movie that are very creepy, and leave lingering feelings or akwardwardness and chills. As mentioned in some of the other Reviews, there is a great moral tied to this movie. I bought the real 3D version, that requires an actual 3D Blu-Ray Player/Playstation 3 along with a 3D TV & Glasses. I enjoyed the 3D effects in this movie. In particular, there are parts that are beyond visually stunning.

If you have not seen this movie, and like animated films with some edge, this is worth watching. Good voice acting, great animation/Quality Graphics, and really has both sides of a coin incorporated, where much of the movie is Dark Colors but then parts where there are incredibly vibrant colors and visually enticing moments of psychedelia, oh yeah!! It's not a 5 star movie in my opinion, but I give it 4 stars for originality, good story and characters, good moral, and great as far as visual quality.

If nothing else, give this movie a rent. A bought the movie to add to my expanding  collection of 3D movies, and after watching this with my wife the other night, I am happy and stand by my purchase =)",1379376000,2,1535,4.494623655913978

Coraline is a magical journey that is ideal for both adults and children - think A Night Before Christmas, but more relatable and (in my opinion) heartwarming.

This is definitely one of my favorite films. Now that I own it, I plan to watch it regularly (at least once a month)!

Something I should note: Watching it in HD (on an HD TV) elevates your experience twofold: the colors and graphics are stunning!",1374624000,,535,4.793478260869565

7770492,5,B01GWCB40Y,"this was a purchase for my wife who LOVES this movie.  (so do i but, she's a little crazy about it.)  i loved the ""tunnel"" in the box.  well, i love most paper-craft and it was really neat to see it applied to movie packaging.  the cards were neat but i get those all the time in anime packaging so that wasn't anything new.  they just sit in the box looking pretty.  the book was pretty insightful.  i do love the extra snippets that you learn reading the ""add-ons"" in the gift sets.  i haven't had the luxury of reading the book so it was neat to learn how different the movie is.

my favorite part of this set is the ANAGLYPH 3D version of the movie.  i really thought the 3D would require a 3D TV, something i feel just isn't there yet, technologically.  (where are the hologram TVs?!?  Japan, i'm looking at you!)  the 3D actually looks better than in the theater.

we had this on DVD, lent it to someone and they returned it with Mystery Science Theater 3000 in it instead of Coraline.  (they don't remember borrowing it but i know it's their copy of MST3K.)  so we were left with a ton of anaglyph 3D glasses and no movie.  the pairs that came with the DVD also work for the Bluray.  BONUS!  now EIGHT people can crowd into our living and watch it in 3D!

so... buy this for the box and the ""simple"" 3D.  this is the first Bluray Anaglyph 3D movie i've watched and it was fantastic.  (still takes a while for the color to balance out but, that's a brain thing.)",1372723200,,1468,4.186379928315413

7770509,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline is some kids movie from 2009 that I decided to check out, and man it was pretty damn good. The designs were original and visually stunning, without being too sugary like some kids movies are. The story is a girl and her parents move into an old house with some weird tenants, and she finds a wormhole into another dimension of the house where it seems every problem in her life is magically fixed. As the story moves along, it gets pretty creepy at parts, for example when Coraline first goes into the other world and nothing seems wrong, yet human instinct is screaming GET OUT. Things that seem happy and normal in the alternate reality have sinister ulterior motives lurking just underneath the happy-go-lucky surface. The moral for the story was great, in a ""shut up and learn to appreciate your life"" kinda way, instead of most kids movies where things magically get better.

If I one day get the worst STD imaginable (kids), I'll no doubt show them this film one day.",1370822400,,982,4.611428571428571

7770521,4,B01GWCB40Y,This movie to much to creepy for children under the age of 11. It is defiantly for older children ..the fat woman swinging with just her boobs covered is disturbing to say the least..but over all I liked it but do not recommend this for small children,1368921600,,251,4.361702127659575
7770522,4,B01GWCB40Y,"The storyline is a little too frightening for younger children. Also, some of the images in the film are a little to graphic, even Coraline exclaims of one of the characters who is scantily dressed is ""wearing no clothes"" or something similar. But it is artfully done. It's a beautiful thing to look at.
The anaglyph 3D effects are good and can contribute to the storytelling. However, some of the scenes were shot in flat 2D and intermixed.
Overall, it's a quirky, clever story for older children and for adults who like stories a little odd and edgy. A fun little roller coaster of a ride.",1368662400,,591,4.584905660377358
7770523,5,B01GWCB40Y,"There are two versions of Coraline 3D.  There is the older anaglyph blu-ray version which includes 4 pairs of red/blue glasses.  The anaglyph version can be enjoyed on pretty much any color tv.  It takes some time for the eyes to get used to the glasses, but ultimately the 3D effect is fairly good (however color rendition suffers greatly).  I'm reviewing the newer ""3D Blu-ray"" version which requires a 3D Blu-ray player and 3D TV with its own corresponding glasses.

This is one of the best looking 3D titles I own.  I believe the film was shot entirely in 3D and I think it looks every bit as real and dimensional on my 47"" as it did in the theaters, maybe better.  The color comes through MUCH better than the anaglyph version of course - subtle, muted and controlled throughout much of the movie, brilliant yet honest and believable in the garden scene and the ending.  Coraline is one of my ""go to"" discs when I want to demo my 3D setup to friends.",1368662400,,955,4.448275862068965

7770525,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Directed by Henry Selick, Coraline is a full length, ""stop motion"" style animated feature.  Why should you care who Henry Selick is?  Because he is the director of such other stop motion films as ""James and the Giant Peach"" and a little movie called ""The Nightmare Before Christmas!""  ""Wait what?!"" you may be saying.  ""Didn't Tim Burton direct The Nightmare Before Christmas?""  No!  No I say!  While it was very much his brain child, Tim Burton was actually the producer!  Now that that's out of the way, on to the story!

The screenplay is based off of a story by celebrated fantasy author Neil Gaiman.  In case his name isn't immediately recognizable to you, perhaps you might recognize some of his other literary work: American Gods, Marvel Comics' ""1602"" & his ""Eternals"" re-imagining as well as DC Comics' ""Sandman"" series.  Perhaps most memorable to the average moviegoer would be ""Stardust,"" which was made into a live-action film in 2007.

The one and only possible downside to Coraline's wonderful story is perhaps that it is VERY reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland.  If you can get past that by seeing the plot as more of a ""shout out"" than a rip-off, you are in store for a thoroughly entertaining movie full of excitement and charm.  Coraline moves at a steady pace so as not to lose the viewer.  No waiting for something interesting to happen here!  Without spoiling too much for you, Coraline is a young girl who winds up in a new home that carries some old secrets.  Her inattentive parents encourage her to explore and she soon winds up in an alternate reality where things seem quite wonderful...for now.  There are many colorful and memorable characters she encounters and every one of them has a purpose.  Some may find the plot a little clich but there are still some twists and turns before the credits roll.  Be warned though.  Those with children 8 years old or under may want to wait on this film due to potentially scary content.  Also, there is a very strange but, in my personal opinion, harmless scene in which an overweight senior citizen is wearing very little.

Visually, this is one of those movies that you could watch without any sound and still be entertained.  Fantastic color-schemes and great set & character designs keep you waiting to see what treats the next scene will hold.  Note: The version I saw was in 3D and while it was cool and all, it wasn't really necessary.  If it's the only version that you can get ahold of than don't hesitate but if you have a choice you may want to choose the more affordable standard version.  Especially if you have small children likely to take off the glasses, already wear glasses or are prone to headache or disorientation.

The voice acting was good for me because it didn't fall into the common trap of making you think of the well known actor doing the voicework.  This is partially because many of the actors were unknown to me and partially because Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher & Ian McShane did a fine job.  They didn't sound too much like themselves or any of their previous characters, especially Dakota.

The musical score was the typical fair for this type of movie but not bad by any means.  At times it sounds like it was done by Danny Elfman but it was actually scored by French composer Bruno Coulais.  This movie is NOT A MUSICAL by the way so if that was likely to put you off it is no longer an excuse.

Coraline wraps up at a tidy 1 hour and 40 minutes which is not too long for kids with short attention spans (and tiny bladders) and not so short as to feel rushed.  Overall I LOVED this movie and can't recommend that you see it enough.  It has everything to keep anyone entertained, kids and adults alike.",1368576000,,3708,4.573596358118361

7770579,1,B01GWCB40Y,"I love Neil Gaiman.  Everything he writes is mystifying, golden, and emotionally cutting...Saying that it is really bad to sit in a theatre and watch his material get brutally moleseted right before my then 13 yr. old eyes.  If you have read the book (which I doubt many reviewers on amazon have done) you would know how tremendously dumbed down and kiddied up this movie was.  They really wanted to draw in a child crowd so they took out a lot of the depth and endearingly dark qualities in the book and replaced them with empty hollow scenes (the garden scene that wasn't in the book), dorky unloveable characters (Wybie who's name is Whyborn probably because Neil Gaiman requested they name him that after he was stupidly designed and put in this travesty of a movie), and unaffectionate empty versions of the books original characters.  I cannot fully express how different these characters are from their novel's counterparts;  Coraline is sweet and adventurous and loves her parents very much and doesn't bitch at them at all like the film version of her does,  it was a HUGE mistake casting Dakota Fanning as her.  Her mom and dad were both loving and gentle parents, I DESPISED the film's version of the mom she was a nasty hag that being said the film version of Coraline was a whiny, selfish, brat which might explain why the film mom is the way she is....The book also has a far darker quality to it which, translated more expertly to film, would probably warrant a PG-13/R rating; It was dark, creepy, brutal, and adventurous.  The film was a bad joke.  That stupid scene where the Other Ms. Spink & Forcible strip down naked and try and do opera in competition with each other (which is ridiculous considering the two NEVER tried to outdo each other in the book) was, in the book, a scene where the two of them act as circus daredevils trying to aim with sharp knives at a small bullseye right above poor Coraline's head.  Sound better than two naked old women?  I thought so!  The scene where the Other Father chases after her on a giant praying mantis in the garden (that wasn't in the book) was a scene in the book where Coraline goes down to the basement to confront the Other Father for one of the lost children's souls...at this point the Other Father is a giant sewn up conglomerate of flesh that nearly KILLS Coraline, way better, way creepier.  There are NO stupid cutesy circus mice they were ALWAYS rats and Coraline ALWAYS KNEW they were rats in the book.  But probably the BIGGEST insult of all to the English writer Neil Gaiman is that the film takes place in America whereas he wrote a sentimental story about the English town he grew up in.  I would give this movie 0 stars if I could but I can't so I'll just say the claymation was good which it was and so was the character design.  That's about ALL that was good about the movie....",1362787200,6,2864,4.521317829457364

First off this movie is NOT for young kids. i don't know how it escaped a pg13 rating (especially by some of the unexpected imagery and content) but i wouldnt recommend it to anyone younger than 12 or 13.

the colors are very vivid and set the tone quite well.  and even though its creepy, its still very cute.  basically its about a girl who feels kind of put off by her parents who are extremely busy and have no time for her. she finds her way to an idealistic version of her world, but as she will learn (as is the overall theme of this which another reviewer mentioned) the grass isn't always greener on the other side.  Whether she's able to escape it or not ill leave that for you to find out :)  this is a tim burton movie after all, anything can happen in the crazy worlds he creates.

I know I'm late to see this, wasn't a big movie goer until recently. I loved Paranorman and heard good reviews of Coraline which was done by the same studio. Unfortunately I had watched some trailers (which I rarely do) so nothing in the movie was really a surprise. I can't say too much about why I don't like it that much, without giving out spoilers. I guess movies are a bit like relationships. You are either drawn to them or not and explaining why is often fruitless.

Without giving away the story line, I felt they missed on charactor development. It was too cartoonish for me to really get drawn into the emotional drama. That is where I felt the difference in stop animation was between Coraline and Paranorman. In Paranorman, the charators were close enough to actual people that I could better relate to them. The best example of this in Coraline was Mr. B. A totally disproportionate character who had a line with 'um pa' in it that reminded me of 'um pa lume pa um pa te do' from 'Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory'. Yes this ages me. Mr. B even had bluish/purple skin like the um pas.

I was surprised when I read a reviewer's line somewhere that claimed this was one of the most imaginative films anywhere. The idea of souls being trapped when their bodies have no eyes comes from Native American Culture. I didn't feel anything in this movie was new. It felt very 'Walt Disney-ish to me.

UPDATE 1/13/13

Watched the movie a 3rd time and like it even less.
Coraline is basically a brat, that always wants more and in this movie always get what see wants. Even at the end, her parents give her want she wanted. The other main thing going on, is the main male character, Coraline's friend is emasculated, which continues the trend in society. Coraline calls him names, (calls him ""why were you born"")beats on him and his body language shows he has low self esteem. I actually like movies with morals, but in this one, the brat gets her way and gets rewarded for being a brat. The entire world revolves around Coraline snd I think it is symptomatic of current society, in the way parents spoil their kids, yet it just makes the kids want more. Then being unhappy when they have everything you think anyone might need. Our tech society just creates addiction because social interaction is totally lacking. Not all that is in the movie, but this movie is disturbing, in a way that it never intended to be. The movie has no deep social interaction whatsoever, and no one even notices it missing.

Great movie for someone who is morally bankrupt. I guess that explains its popularity in our society.",1357776000,4,2814,4.540433925049309
7770656,5,B01GWCB40Y,"This movie is spectacular in 2D, but the 3D makes it unsurpassed by its peers.

The 3D in this film isn't garish or gimicky - it is often subdued and is skillfully employed to enhance the story when appropriate. The use of 3D in Coraline is comparable to the use of technicolor in the Wizard of Oz; it is most pronounced when Coraline in the magical ""other world,"" emphasizing the contrast between it and Coraline's normal life as well as its dazzling allure. This makes for some of the most stunning and well used 3D I've seen.
The story of Coraline is eerie and enchanting - both children and adults alike can appreciate its dark fairy-tale like qualities.

7770658,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline is a strange, darkly-tinted story of a girl moving into an old apartment building with her parents. Coraline starts off irritated with her new situation: her apartment is boring, her neighbors are bizarre, and her parents are negligent and obsessed with work. When Coraline dreams, she goes through a little door leading to a world, where her ""Other"" Mother and Father live, and everything she finds bad or boring in her real life becomes extraordinary. Each time she wakes up more frustrated with the real world, but eventually, she starts to find that something is off with the world behind the door.

I've seen Coraline described as Alice in Wonderland meets The Nightmare Before Christmas, and I think that's a very fitting comparison, when talking about the story and visual style. This certainly has Tim Burton's signature style, which I always want to love, but I never quite feel like I ""get"". Still, I do like Coraline for what it is. The visuals are quite cool and, sometimes, lovely, even in their strangeness. I have a great affinity for the music. I also love the story, which I'm guessing is mostly to Neil Gaiman's credit, though I've yet to read the book to see how closely the movie sticks to the original story.

There are a few things to keep in mind if getting this movie for a child. It can be quite disturbing and scary at times, and if I had watched it at a young age, I think I'd be quite scared. The neighbors also put on a short play that seemed a little too sexual for a PG rating. Just look up the Miss Spink and Miss Forcible scene to see what I mean.",1357516800,,1589,4.513888888888889

This is not a Blu-Ray 3D movie.",1357257600,9,547,4.0092592592592595
7770681,5,B01GWCB40Y,"This review is for the Blu-ray 3-D version (not the anaglyph, not the regular DVD) of Coraline.  For whatever reason, Amazon lumps all the reviews on a given movie together.

I wasn't sure about Coraline.  I'm a 40 year old guy with a big Samsung 3-D TV and a surround setup, and I love a good movie as much as the next guy, but when a friend insisted that this was the movie she wanted to see, I was a bit taken aback.  Coraline?  What's it about?  Could I get into it?  Is it another in a long line of these totally CG movies like ""Shrek"" and ""Cars""?

Turns out the answers are yes, anyone could get into it; and no, it's not just another Pixar/Disney/RenderMan product.  Coraline is a partly CG, but mostly stop-motion feature film, with real puppets (Coraline herself had ""hundreds of heads,"" I am informed, and a special seamstress was employed to sew her tiny outfits.)  Stop motion is a tricky business at best and a crew of hundreds were employed for years to bring the awesome - and they succeeded.  As other reviewers have noted the film is a visual feast, and it displays a very personal, very idiosyncratic visual style which coheres through the whole film.

Plot-wise, the film is very classic fantasy - reminded me of Pan's Labyrinth, just a little bit.  A young girl, depressed by her distant parents who are busy with troubles of their own, retreats into a fantasy world where things are not what they seem - and then things take a malignant turn.  No point in spoilering it - it's a classic plot and it's played out beautifully, the timing and the three-act structure are just superb.  If you are an adult who can stand a fairy tale - there is a talking cat - you will absolutely love it.  Despite the fairy-tale veneer, though, this is not for young children - no sex, but there is some real horror going on and I don't think I'd expose anyone much under the age of 12 to it, maybe a very resilient and worldly-wise 11 year old, but no younger.

The 3-D is incredible - I am reviewing the HDMI 1.4a Blu-Ray 3-D, not the color-based anaglyph.  My TV does 240 Hz with active-shutter and I have never seen a better use of 3-D; it was like looking through a window into a real world, or a shadowbox at least - both I and my friend soon forgot we were even watching a 3-D movie, it was just a seamless part of the experience.  The voice acting, music, and surround sound were also technically and emotionally excellent, just examples of perfectly executed filmmaking at a very high level.

I rarely say this, but I am quite certain I will watch this movie again and again and I will take great delight in showing it to friends.

Some of the stuff in the very foreground was blurry, but other than that the 3D worked great.  The movie itself is wonderful, the art i wonderful, the story is wonderful, everything is just great.

It is legit creepy though, I would not recommend to sensitive children or adults with phobias of spiders, needles, kidnapping, bugs, creepy dolls, buttons, people made out of taffy, rats/mice, people who are just clothing stuffed with something, being mute, having your mouth sewn, and maybe enclosed spaces/ deep holes.

honestly it is a tad 'dark' JUST like nightmare before christmas, BUT my 2 year old and 5 year old sat through it just fine with no nightmares. my 2 year old girl really really enjoyed the movie and wanted to watch it 2x in a row!

i liked it, storyline was well thought out, movie was perfect, box set is great for people who loved the movie and want some extra tidbits.

no, i have not seen the 3D version of the movie, i was nervous about my 2year old seeing the hands reaching for her, but maybe next year we can try that.

After much research & debate, I purchased the region free 3D version, which had no comparability issues. The picture quality & 3D are amazing - better than it looked in the theater. The lower price for this import version made it a complete no-brainer (kind if like the Alien Anthology region-free Blu-Ray set). Great movie, great price.

7770804,1,B01GWCB40Y,"Since posting the review below, M. Manville set me straight that the comments on Amazon.com for this movie are combined for all available versions of the movie.  So if you are looking at the Coraline blu-ray version that says anaglyph, you are looking at the red/blue glasses 3D version.  Coraline is also available in 3D for 3D capable tv/blu-ray players.  If you find the ""Other Formats & Versions"" section on the webpage, click on the '+' symbol to expand out the list.  From there, there are a couple of 2 disc blu-ray versions and one of them is a link to the newer 3D version (at the present time it is the most expensive at $29.99)  The product photo clearly shows that the box is marked 3D.

**********
The product description is vague and should point out clearly that this IS NOT the great quality 3D that we experienced in the theater when this movie came out and that our newer 3D tv's and blu-ray players have (and that they describe in the Amazon's Editorial Reviews section on the product page).  This is the old-school red and blue glasses 3D from back when 3D sucked.  I guess we're supposed to know that Anaglyph 3D means red/blue glasses type.

I made the mistake of believing another reviewer on Amazon who was either lying about the type of 3D or didn't know what he was talking about.

Hope I saved you the $10 until they release this in all its original high quality 3D glory!",1353110400,3,1399,4.4940711462450595

She is bitter about it and is not too fond of her new neighbors. Coraline finds a secret door which leads to another world. In the other world she meets other mother and her life is as she dreamed. However, things are not always as they seem. Other mother turns out to evil. Coraline must not only escape the other world but free her real parents and defeat other mother.

I have read in other reviews with concerns about how frightening this film is. However, it is rated PG, and therefore is not for young children to begin with. If parents are searching for a non-spooky Halloween film then I would recamend ""It's the great pumpkin Charlie Brown"" or ""Alvin and the Chipmunks meet Frankenstein"".

There is a brief moment of nudity which is non-sexual. One of the elderly ladies portraying ""The birth of Venus"". I do not find it offensive. Here is where I am coming from, when I was in elementry school my class took a feild trip to an art meseum and the first thing the teachers showed us was a statue of Venus in the nude. Seeing that statue did not harm any student on the feild trip, the teachers were teaching us about the history of art. If parents are concerned about thier children seeing that scene they could just skip it.

And I have to say that the sceen with the large busted woman with a bikini bottom and pasties on was a little inappropriate for my kids (6 and 8yrs.).  Luckily neither of my children noticed it much except for my daughter to comment ""she has huge boobs"".  I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone with younger kids.

7770863,5,B01GWCB40Y,"When was the last time you had a good scare?  Coraline is an interesting stop motion animation feature that came out in 2009.
It is based off the book of the same name that came out in 2002.  It is very well done and guaranteed to work your imagination.
Coraline is essentially a movie about a little girl with an adventurous young spirit.
She moves to a new apartment building with her parents and is destined to find an adventure.
During her adventure she meets the neighborhoods and makes friends with fellow tenants.
She eventually finds a secret door that leads to an alternative universe.
At first glace everything in the other universe is wonderful and ideal.
Her alternative world parents spoil her and everything is fun and games.
Before long she realizes that this vision of reality is actually fueled by an evil force.
Throughout the movie Coraline interacts with many different interesting characters in a battle to overcome
the monsters on the other side of reality.
Coraline is actually a horror movie that is also a children's film.
The images and scenes are fantastic and really capable of causing a stir in a person of any age.
Caroline is imaginative, entertaining, and creative film.",1348272000,,1202,4.830097087378641
7770864,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I am so happy I got to see Coraline finally. The quality of the story telling and the imagination used to realize this world in such a unique way should really be praised. I can't really criticize the movie for being dark or intense because it never claims to not be. It should be noted that younger kids (under 10yrs) may find some of the scenes really scary because the main villain imprisons Coraline's parents at one point. I think of this film as having the same vibe as early Jim Henson fantasy movies such as the Dark Crystal or Labyrinth.

7770876,4,B01GWCB40Y,"As a big fan of stop-motion animation (using physical objects), any time a stop-motion film gets wide distribution I celebrate.  Simply put, stop-motion animation is my favorite film making medium.  I did it as a kid and I appreciate its unique place in the world of film art today.  Unlike 2d cell animation (Disney style), 3d stop-motion animation seams to be finding a place in the computer driven world of feature films.  Though not specifically advancing the art of stop-motion animation, Coraline dutifully keeps it alive for all the right reasons.

WARNING: RISK OF SEVERE GEEK JUICING BEYOND THIS POINT!!!  PLEASE WEAR EYE PROTECTION!!

STOP-MOTION = CREEPY
If you want a fantasy to be creepy, inject a little stop-motion and you will be successful.  If you look back at prominent films that employ Stop-motion it becomes clear: Corps Bride, Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the Were Rabbit, Chicken Run and everything Ray Harryhausen did.  Stop-motion usually equates to creepy or fantastic.  Most fans of the technique would agree that it's the slightly jerky and awkward movements that contribute to the surreal and eerie feel that is so effective in these films.  ""Coraline"" is a very creepy film and even more so for employing stop-motion.

TAKING A STEP BACK FROM ""CORPSE BRIDE""
In my humble opinion ""Corpse Bride"" was the best feature film done entirely in stop-motion.  As the first film to use digital still cameras to animate 3d objects, ""Corpse Bride"" set the standard for character expression, meaningful movement and Stop-motion artistry.  ""Coraline"" takes a slight step back from ""Corpse Bride"" in its animation technique.  Things don't move quite as smoothly.  Characters don't have the same sense of weight or expressiveness.  All of that aside, ""Coraline"" is still an excellent piece of art and I enjoyed watching it despite not meeting ""Corpse Bride"" standards.

MOVING A STEP AHEAD OF ""CORPSE BIRDE""
Where ""Coraline"" advances the art of film making may not be in stop motion particularly, but rather in its hybrid technique use.  ""Coraline"" may well be the first film to combine stop-motion with CGI and very effectively in my opinion.  Many people revile CGI due to over-reliance on it by many in the film industry.  Very often films start to look like video games.  In ""Coraline"" CGI is used strictly as a background device.  Some might call this ""cheating"", but I can't imagine how this film could be achieved as effectively without it.  As much as I love stop-motion, CGI has its place and this was a creative place to use it.

ACTORS WHO DON'T SING
""Coraline"" is unique for a stop-motion film in that there are no extraneous musical numbers in the place of conversation.  That does not mean there is no music at all, it just means that the music occurs when it might in reality:  While someone plays the piano, in a theater, and at the Circus.  I was taken aback when the characters broke out in song during ""Corpse Bride"".  I never expected it and it took a couple of viewings to get used to it.  In Coraline the music was natural and unobtrusive.  Though I've never heard Dakota Fanning (Coraline) or Teri Hatcher (Mom 1 and Mom 2) sing, I'm not disappointed I haven't yet.  They both did excellent work here with Hatcher being the surprise of the day.  She personally made the ""Stepford Wives"" look downright inviting.  I don't want to take the time to talk about all the actors, though I should mention all involved make significant contributions.

WHAT ABOUT THE STORY ""GEEK-MIAS""?
I enjoyed the story quite a bit.  The question is, will you?  Here's how my family received this film.
WIFE:  she doesn't like being reminded of her own mortality, so she was not too thrilled with a story that has dead children in it.  She thought the movie was ok but didn't like the subject matter.
SON:  as a sensitive 6 year old, he was somewhat frightened by it.  He liked the format and the fantasy, but was less than thrilled with the bugs and scary stuff, same as my wife.
DAUGHTER:  She liked it.  As a 10 year old, she related a lot to Coraline because she's close to the same age and has awful parents just like Coraline... ...wait, did I say that?  Regardless, I've raised her to enjoy scary stuff so she was with it.  She thoroughly enjoyed it.
ME:  I love stop-motion and the story was original enough to keep me guessing.  There were dead children, so peril was well established.  There are plenty of quirky (crazy) characters and plenty of creepy stuff too, so I was well satisfied.
THE 4 YEAR OLD SITTING NEXT TO ME:  ""Mommy, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN!!""  I guess she didn't like it.  That warmed my heart.

LIKE THE CHILDREN OF ""HAMLIN"", I'M HOOKED
Though not reaching the heights that ""Corpse Bride"" did, ""Coraline"" immediately went on my DVD wish-list after leaving the theater.  Seeing it in 3D was really not important and actually a distraction.  Seeing it without the glasses is fine.  The story is dark like many fairy tales and harkens back to the ""Pied Piper of Hamlin"" which creeped me out as a kid, so your kids might be a little disturbed.  For fans of stop-motion, it's a reason to smile.

My older sister was 21 at the time we watched the movie together and she had nightmares about it. I don't understand the hype. The people who gave this movie high praise must be demented. My cousin is also terrified of this movie. She watches horror movies all the time and they don't bother her, but she despises this movie. One time, my cousin and I were staying at a relative's house and there was a small door in the wall like the one Coraline crawls through in the movie to get to the other world.

7770892,1,B01GWCB40Y,"One of the things I truly hate
is when Hollywood *&^%-up a good
story! In the book there is NO Wylie
or his grandmother! And there was NO
doll replica of Coraline,either.
The rats spied on her and reported
to the spider witch.

Coraline and the cat both defeat the
Spider Witch and Coraline later tricks
the spider hand and throws it into the
well along with the key. But in the movie
Coraline needed a GUY to save her bacon.

Wylie was riding a motorbike and not a
white horse but the idea was still the
same.:(

All through this film I kept wishing
that it was live action and not claymation
or whatever the ""special effects"" were.

The movie was boring and about as interesting
as watching paint dry.
I feel sorry for Neil Gaiman...it must have been
painful for him to see what happened to his book.

Especially the parts with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible
and the near pornographic performance of the Other Actresses.
I can only assume that that was meant for the adults in the audience.

They made this film 3-D so you can REALLY see how bad it is.

I have to give this piece of crap one star because there is
no 'thumbs down' option.

I shudder to think what they might do to The Graveyard Book if
they decide to make it into a film as well.

So I heartily recommend the book but NOT this cheap flick.
And I am also very glad that I checked it out of the library
and didn't waste my good money buying it. Now I just wish I
could get back the hour and forty-one minutes I spent watching
this.

7770896,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Ahhh...the beauty of stop-motion animation...something that has kind of fell along the wayside for the ease of a computer animation (not trying to take the hard work out of that). I just miss the hand drawn and the claymation that seems to have been replaced. I'm an old fashion girl at heart, though I do love the beauty of CG stuff and nothing can be the special effects. Still, if you are a lover of the genius of Neil Gaiman's work, Coraline will take you on a dark adventure into a little girl's want for everything and the realization that sometimes getting it is not always best.

Coraline is the story of a little girl that is forced to move somewhere new for her parent's work, both who ignore her and are absorbed in their own little worlds. In an effort to entertain herself, she meets Wybie, a weird boy with a stray black cat, who tells her of his grandma's sister disappearing in the same apartment as she lives now.

Coraline laughs it off, but when she find a little door that seems to lead to another world at night, she starts believing that just maybe Wybie is right. On the other side is her life only the way she wants it with everyone catering to her every desire and totally absorbed in making her happy. The only thing that is odd about this new place is everyone except the black stray cat has buttons for eyes and the cat seems to talk. Will Caroline stay or will see she what is really going on in front of her?

For lovers of Nightmare Before Christmas and Corspe Bride, Coraline will give you all the good fun darkeness you've enjoyed, but this is definitely not a movie for younger viewers. It is scary, has a scene that involves a fat woman and a thong, and could give nightmares rather easily. I suggest that this one can wait until they are at least ten, same as the novel that started it all. Besides that, Coraline is visually gorgeous and a definite buy on BluRay, if you have it. The clarity and 3D scenes make it stunning as well as pull you into the world that Gaiman creates.

I would definitely give this one a 4 1/2 out of 5. Be careful what you wish for.",1331424000,3,2097,4.314720812182741

Several years later, they watch the movie again and they both really enjoyed it. The first time I watched it, I thought ""What the..."", but somewhere midway into the movie, I got the point and found the film fascinating. It is entertaining, funny and, yes scary - intensely so. The idea behind the movie is to not expect the world to revolve around yourself and not just to be content with what you have, but to really appreciate what you have...your life, family, neighbors, possessions, etc.",1330646400,,627,4.557522123893805
7770898,4,B01GWCB40Y,"This uncommon animation starts with tween-aged angst, the kind that demands independence but still wants mom and dad close by. Her busy parents don't have much time for her, though, and her new, remote home doesn't offer much reward for her explorations (other than some rather kooky neighbors). So, even if it's not wholly conscious, Coraline wishes for a nicer place and parents that pay more attention.

As the movie's tagline says, ""be careful what you wish for."" Like Alice down the rabbit hole, Coraline finds a secret passage to a more magical place. Soon, however, the magic turns dark. That's where the brilliant animation really comes into its own. The stop animation (or at least the look of it) bring to mind Tim Burton with a macabre touch of Brothers Quay. You know your child best - skittish ones might find some of the imagery a bit much. Still, kids' stories (like Alice in Wonderland) have always had dark edges. That deliciously spooky sense, plus some great animation, really set this movie apart from the usual.

This went over with the children about as well as you think it would. My purchase of, A Nightmare Before Christmas, led to the recommendation of this movie. It was cheap so I picked it up. The next gathering we had, over the weekend of Halloween, the kids picked this movie over Disney favorites such as The Lion King, Bambi, and Sleeping Beauty. They wanted a spooky flick in accordance with Halloween and this one provided just the right level. As far as the actual movie, I don't know much.

The first stop-motion feature shot in stereoscopic 3-D, Coraline features big-headed, stick-bodied animated characters with huge eyes and demonic grins set against menacing backgrounds and an undercurrent of spooky music. Coraline is a teenager who has just moved to an old house in the middle of nowhere with her writer parents and she is bored, bored, bored............",1322179200,,576,5.34065934065934
7770918,5,B01GWCB40Y,"(Possible Spoilers)

""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was a pretty groundbreaking film that mixed stop motion animation with music and some good old fashioned creepiness. ""Coraline"" continues this trend though to me is fairly darker than ""Nightmare"". A young girl named Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) moves to a small town with her parents and she's not happy about it, she finds her life here boring and she doesn't care for her parents inability to pay attention to her.

One night she finds a blocked door which leads to a familiar world, but her parents are nicer, everything is happier and brighter and Coraline of course likes this world and would like to stay but her other ""mother"" (Teri Hatcher) wants her to sew buttons onto her eyes. This alarms Coraline and the rest of the film involves her trying to figure out the mystery of this other world.

The visuals are top notch, the voice acting fits very well, the story is pretty detailed and there's some good elements of creepiness that make this film not really for younger kids. I personally enjoyed this film as everything just came together and made for a well rounded film. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.",1322179200,2,1167,4.767326732673268

Directed by Henry Selick and based upon the best seller by Neil Gaiman, Coraline follows the phantasmagoric exploits of the title character, a bored 11-year-old who discovers a door in her house that leads to a parallel version of her life -- one that at first is enchanting, but soon threatens to entrap our hero. Coraline is one of the most visually dazzling pictures to come along in many a moon, and it's anchored by a delightfully twisted storyline.",1320969600,,625,4.850467289719626

I had never imagined someone or some team would make such a terrible scary movie and name it ""for kids"". It is definitely NOT FOR KIDS! From the characters to the scenes to the music and worst of all to the plot, nothing is for kids! Especially the music! It is just disturbing and horrifying. The darkness in the storyline is not even appropriate for adults. The whole idea of the movie is almost like telling you: ""be happy with your naughty parents because if not, your dreamy parents are actually the devils and would love to kill you!"" It made me feel very very uncomfortable for few days. I had even wondered if it had impacted my baby girl. Its just stinks! I have tons of Disney movies and Non-Disney Kids movies, and this one is not even 1% belongs to KIDs. Horrible, it is more horrible than a horror movie!

7770926,4,B01GWCB40Y,"My first grader has inherited my affinity for scary flicks, though of course all that she's been exposed to is the kid-friendly variety. Coraline is the darkest of all the ""scary"" flicks we've watched this October, but we watched it together, discussed various aspects whenever she had a question, and surprisingly she did not find it scary though she did comment on some parts being creepy. I think for her age, she probably did not quite grasp some of the darker aspects of the movie, but she did get the gist of the movie, and the message behind it.

Coraline's story bears the message ""the grass is not always greener on the other side."" Coraline complains about her life with her parents, at not being able to do what she wants, when she wants, blah blah blah. Until one day, she discovers a door or portal into another world, where everything seems so much better, just like her present life, only more interesting and appealing. Of course there's a catch, and the seemingly ""benign"" mother figure in this other world soon turns out to be vile and wicked with an evil agenda - to keep Coraline trapped with her forever, as with all the other lost children. Coraline discovers that not only does she have to escape this evil entity's clutches, but also save her parents who have become trapped in another world, and free the souls of the captive children.

The animation is unique and interesting and fascinated both my daughter and myself. I certainly think this is a movie that is more appropriate for older children, ages 8 and up, but with parental supervision and guidance, it can be appreciated by a younger child. It certainly brought up some interesting issues for discussion between my daughter and I. Intelligent, well-scripted (and based on Neil Gaiman's novel), this is a movie I'm adding to our DVD library.

7770933,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.

Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of ""Coraline,"" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous ""other"" world.

Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.

It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed ""other mother"" (Teri Hatcher) and matching ""other father,"" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.

At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.

Neil Gaiman's book ""Coraline"" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.

Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.

The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.

Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.

The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.

""Coraline"" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures -- definitely for fans of Gaiman, dark fantasy and really creepy stuff.",1314489600,4,3602,4.998330550918197

We've got an actual 3D television with the proper glasses and the effects are absolutely brilliant with all the 3D DVD's we've bought from Amazon.  However, I suddenly turned from the most awesome nan ever, her words, to a not very impressive nan after all, once the 3D DVD was put on their television. (this 3D version had 4 sets of special glasses enclosed with it and could be used on an ordinary television as long as these glasses were worn).  Well, it was dreadful.  The DVD came out as virtually black and white, there was hardly any 3D - it just came in now and then and when it did it was very blurred. She was so disappointed and because we were going on holiday I had ordered it by first class post (my choice, I know), but it made it almost 18.00 which was even more disappointing.  I wouldn't have minded had the quality been first class. We all watched it to the end thinking it was just a blip and would improve, but it didn't. Huge disappointment all round.

It was very impressive actually, and after watching the making of video I know why. They actually took the time to set the camera shots up so that each shot was taken twice, roughly each eye of a 9 inch figurine. What does that mean? It means that if gives you the view as if you were one of those 9 inch tall character in the movie. Beautiful attention to detail makes this a wonderful movie. When I watched this movie in 2D afterwards it did not feel the same, it took out the element of being in the story. It was the same TV but it did not feel like the movie I watched in 3D. The sharpness of detail was not as apparent.

7770959,1,B01GWCB40Y,"I have to confess...as a lover of animation and all things fantasy, I was slightly ashamed to admit that I had yet to see Coraline a whole two years after its release. Having seen the movie at last I am inclined to wonder if Henry Selick sold his soul to the devil in exchange for critical acclaim and some box office success. How else could such an inept, unpleasant exercise generate such a critical fuss? With virtually no story, characters as soulless as the clay they're made of and voice-acting with all the nuance and subtly of a bad anime dub, it's a wonder Coraline hasn't earned its place among the very worst animated films of the past decade, or at least the most overrated.

Now I know what you're thinking--troll alert. Um, no. I love animation and I love a good movie, so why wouldn't I want to love Coraline? Well, apparently, wanting to love it just wasn't enough. I've enjoyed Selick's work in the past, but much like Tim Burton and Guillermo del Toro his story-telling and directional skills pale in comparison to his visual sense. This is true of TNBC, JATGP as well as Coraline. However, TNBC had wit, imagination and great music to override its more uninspired moments. Coraline has, well...a plot constructed in the likeness of a bad video-game, where Coraline must defeat the Other Mother and her demonic henchmen, not only to save her own family but to liberate the souls of the children unlucky enough to have fallen prey to her needle and thread. She has help (of course) in the form of a talking cat (of course) and magical objects (of course). She learns some valuable lessons along the way (of course) and ends up slightly less miserable than how she began (of course).

The plot is conventional, yes, but the conventionality isn't the problem--it's the approach. The emotions take a backseat to the action and ""scary"" imagery. We have plenty of scenes of The Other Mother spouting typical bad-guy dialogue while skulking around in her spidery outfit; we have a magical garden that turns demonic and tries to pull Coraline to her demise; not to mention a host of trapeze-swinging circus mice, creepy button eyes, and a mechanical praying mantis. It's all very grotesque, which I guess was the intention...but to be honest, its all pretty empty. Like gore for gore's sake, Coraline is grotesque for grotesque's sake. People have said that Coraline is an adult fairy-tale masquerading as a children's movie. But what makes this adult, exactly? Scary pictures? Sorry, I'm not buying it. Smart stories and intelligent writing make for an ""adult"" picture, not trying-to-be-weird/scary imagery and a ham-fisted message about the importance of looking after your kids.

Good characters can save a bad story, but Coraline has none to yield. Coraline herself is an unpleasant child, which isn't necessarily a problem. Fairy tales are bursting with bratty kids who come out stronger and better in the end. Take Chihiro in Spirited Away. She was something of a brat and despite her being surrounded by a magical landscape inhabited by spirits, talking frogs and dragons was a real, textured character. Coraline is not. Nor are her quirky neighbors, who possess no defining traits other than the fact that they are quirky. The same is true of Coraline's neglectful parents, who possess no defining traits other than the fact that they are neglectful. God forbid they skip the bad musical numbers and circus mice is favor of some characterization. But no, sadly. Animation takes precedence over just about everything else is Coraline, excluding maybe the music, which was just okay.

One wonders what might have been if Selick, instead of trying to dazzle his audience with elaborate sequences and gross imagery, had injected these characters with even the slightest amount of soul or humanity. That's a very different movie; it's the ""Other"" Coraline. However, unlike world behind the door in Selick's movie, The ""Other"" Coraline not only seems better...

It is better.",1299628800,8,3987,4.927083333333333

7770965,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I had no earthly idea what I was in for when I popped ""Coraline"" in the Blu-Ray player. My wife, my nearly-8-year-old son and I curled up with some popcorn after dinner, and sat back to see what this was all about.
From the first eerie, muted scenes, and off-kilter score, you realize you're about to take a trip to somewhere you haven't been before, and it might not be 100% pleasant.
I must say my son was hypnotized from the first scene. He even put down his Nintendo DS. I don't think he blinked more than twice during the whole running time.
The tale, about Coraline, her odd family and MORE odd ""other"" family, is a fractured fairy tale to be sure. There's a classicism to the story...it has a little Hansel and Gretel to it...but it's also defiantly modern in the heroine's sensibilities.
The plot has been outlined to death by other reviewers.
While the movie unspooled, my wife kept looking over to me, the look on her face of ""this is kinda creepy"" was unmistakable.
I asked my son a few times, ""Are you OK? Are you scared?"", and each time he replied ""Yes"" with a smile.
The animation is living, breathing,  moving art. Dear God you could stare into that (2D for me) picture and find infinite, amazing details within each room, each exterior...the garden...there's one shot that will literally take your breath away. You will actually pause your respiratory effort, so that you can absorb that gorgeous overhead shot of the garden. If you've seen the movie, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't, well, if you remember anything about this review, you'll remember THIS when you see that shot.
The voice acting is superb. The expressive puppetry is nothing short of miraculous. The music is intertwined with the images brilliantly.

7770974,3,B01GWCB40Y,"I've seen some of the reviews on here from parents, basically referring it to a few steps away from being Satanic.  Dark?  The Nightmare Before Christmas was much darker than this movie- as well as the Corpse Bride.  Unless your kids aren't exposed to what's on the Cartoon Network and are ultra-sensitive, I'm going to say that this movie is okay to watch.  (Being that you might consider turning their heads at a certain part of the film as I will soon mention.)

It is about a young girl whose parents are always busy off doing their own thing.  Whenever Coraline goes to them for anything, they push her off, telling her to go count windows, making bargains of having her leave them alone for awhile if they do something for her, etc.  She isn't a sweet little girl as some of the other reviewers probably expected her to be.  She's more of a preteen experiencing a little bit of teenaged angst.  But because of this boredom, Coraline comes across a small door to a little world, where she meets her ""Other Mother"" and father.  As wonderful as this world may seem at first, it seems that the Other Mother has other motives for enticing Coraline to remain over there.

My daughter is now five, and we watched it together last year together.  It's not that big of a deal really- until you get to the ""Other"" neighbors who live downstairs.  Apparently, the two elderly eccentric women had a kind of vaudeville act together in their younger days, where they performed acrobatics, theater, etc. (They also collect taxidermed Scottish terriers of pets that have passed, and dress them in angel costumes.  I cringed how the taller one was costumed, and wondered why this would be necessary to put into a film, targeted at a younger audience.  (She was very much 'endowed', and wearing pasties and a barely visible bikini bottom, flying on a trapeze.  Even Coraline was shocked!)  I can only guess this was an inside joke amongst those making the film.  Nonetheless, my daughter now instinctively turns her head until it's alright to look again.

Honestly though, the rest of the movie isn't that big of a deal.  Other reviewers say that the ""Other Mother"" gets killed, therefore making it violent.  (Spoiler- all that happens to her, is that her mechanical hand gets broken off as Coraline escapes and slams the door behind her.  And then the hand, and the key to the door, get dumped into the well at the end.  A couple of the sawdust-filled mice also get pounced on by the cat in the story. But since they are 'doll-like', I don't understand how they then could be ""killed"".)

Other than that, the plotline is kind of boring. They have characters in it that aren't really necessary, and the ending isn't very satisfying, because you don't get a full grasp on any closure going on with the other characters in the story.",1294272000,,2818,4.63508064516129

7770980,4,B01GWCB40Y,"After very disappointing ""Monkeybone,"" Henry Selick, director of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)"" and ""James and the Giant Peach (1996)"", has returned with ""Coraline,"" a delightful stop-motion animated fantasy tale - a bit dark one as based on a Neil Gaiman book. This is a modern-day adventure of Alice-like spirited heroine encountering these eccentric characters in another universe, some of which could be as terrifying as the head-chopping Queen of Hearts.

Coraline Jones (voice by Dakota Fanning) has recently moved in the 150-year-old Pink Palace Apartments. The 11-year-old girl has no friends to talk to, except a slightly nervous boy ""Wybie"" (Robert Bailey, Jr.). And Coraline's parents Charlie (voice by John Hodgman) and Mel (voice by Teri Hatcher) are too busy.

But Coraline, an independent, intelligent and curious girl, finds a strange door while exploring the old house. She then discovers a big secret about it. Through the door, only at night, she can go to the ""other"" world, where she meets the ""Other Mother"" and the ""Other Father."" The other parents are caring and loving - and the Other Father, always delightful, is an incredibly gifted pianist!

It is only natural that Coraline starts visiting the other world frequently. But there is another big secret about the wonderful world and its inhabitants Coraline has not known yet.

The storyline itself may not b exactly original and Coraline's adventure (or ""game"") is not really an adventure to some, but like many classic fairy tales ""Coraline"" is most intriguing and disturbing when it suggests the fate of those who have made a wrong decision. With colorful and imaginative (and sometimes even creepy) visuals, strong voice acting from Dakota Fanning giving life to the heroine, ""Coraline"" is an engaging fantasy with some dark edges.",1290470400,2,1821,5.226027397260274

Her parents are both very busy working on their gardening catalog, which they hope to sell and make lots of money, so Coraline is left seeking parental love. She's also bored in her new place, surrounded by strange and quirky neighbors. A neighborhood kid gives her a doll that happens to look a lot like her, though it has buttons for eyes.

Things start getting strange for Coraline, and the line between reality and fantasy is blurred masterfully. The way the movie is filmed is aesthetically beautiful, yet slightly strange and twisted, reminiscent of Nightmare Before Christmas or Corpse Bride.

All in all, I liked the movie. The visual effects were amazing, the accompanying music fitting, and the story intriguing. It seems like a great movie for a child, as I imagine their eyes would be wide with wonder at what they are seeing. The movie is available in 3-d, if you happen to have glasses or something to watch it in, which could make it even more enjoyable. I can easily recommend this movie to you for a family film, or simply as a snuggle-up-and-watch-a-movie-together film, too.",1288828800,,1365,4.77542372881356
7770986,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I picked this up on a whim - we don't have children but sometimes enjoy children's movies.  I was looking for Tim Burton's new ""Alice in Wonderland"" and picked this up at the same time.  I was an early fan of Tim Burton and really enjoyed ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  Before picking this up I asked myself what ""Nightmare"" would have been like without Tim.  I shouldn't have been worried - I liked this much, much more than ""Alice"".  Even more than ""Nightmare"", for that matter.

There was something about this movie that was completely mesmerizing - I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen.  It was delightfully dark and quirky, but the word that fits it best is ""creepy"".  The ""horror"" was subdued, almost Hitchcockian, which contrasted greatly with some of the more elaborate/extravagant scenes such as the elderly sisters' trapeze act.  The 3D works well but the colors weren't as eye-popping in the Other Mother's Universe with the glasses on as when watching in plain 2D.

A lot has been written here about the plot and the characters so I'll skip most of that.

Be warned though--this is not a movie for children. Even though it has a cartoonish look and many humorous scenes, the plot is dark and some of the ideas are frightening enough that my college friends and I were discussing the ""freakiness"" of the movie as we exited the theatre.

In fact, it was so hard to watch in ""3D"" that I ended up skipping the glasses and watching it without them for 90% of the movie.  Even in an extremely dark room there were hardly any 3D effects.

7771001,5,B01GWCB40Y,"One of those movies that recall what made the 1931 films ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" dear to both young and old audiences, and just like the edited versions of such fairy tales like ""Rumpelstiltskin"", ""Hansel and Gretel"", and ""The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids"", ""Coraline"" is a traditional, classical horror movie that features no blood, no guts, no swearing, a building terror, an unnerving reality, and lastly the birth and maturity of a hero that learns to be careful what she wishes for.

Never let the cutesy look and stop-motion animation aspects fool you: Director Henry Selick and writer Neil Gaimen create a worthy realm filmed with cautious intrigue and moral parables that move perfectly in the vain of any Brothers Grim story. As much as children will be awed, the classical subtexts can play on the imagination of adults as well, reminding them how truly evil the bad guys in some of these children's stories can be. There is enough creative depth here to capture the imagination of both young and old.

As with the Single-Disc Edition w/3D: it is a two sided disk, one side plays the 2D version, the other the 3D version, and they come with 3D glasses for four. Beside that, there is only a commentary track. Usually such DVDs that lack even a behind-the-scenes feature or twenty is not worth it. On the other hand, when you think about it, what else is there to learn? You know Dakota Fanning and Ian McShane are providing voices, and Selick had directed Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". Sometimes, a very bad movie that goes to DVD has so many extras on it they're better than the movie; other times, the extras overshadow even the good movies. The common theme of this DVD reflects the movie and it works: simple, simplicity, and lets just get right down to watching the movie, not the trailers.

For the sake of simplicity in movie watching, and for those who enjoy a horror movie for the whole family as the classical horror movies do, ""Coraline"" is a must have in your collection.",1281225600,,2016,4.721590909090909

I personally have only worn them for a few minutes and they seemed to be decent, but I prefer to watch the movie without.

The movie itself is beautifully animated with lovable characters and a great storyline.  Dakota Fanning was the perfect actress to voice Coraline and she did a great job.

However, I would recommend that parents with small children don't show this to them without viewing it themselves first.  The Nightmare Before Christmas had spooky characters but it was still an enjoyable film for youngsters.  Coraline is a little different because this actually could scare children with the spooky magic and imagery that happens later in the film.  When I first watched this movie it had an eerie feel to it (and I'm 21 years old).  That's when I thought to myself, ""This movie isn't for kids.""  With all of that said, this movie had quickly grown to become my favorite animated feature.

7771006,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline (no, that's NOT a spelling mistake!) may be one of the spookiest animated films I've seen in quite some time.

What makes it different from all the rest is the constantly quiet and creepy atmosphere, and the highly unusual flow to all the animated scenes.

When this film first began for example, I was completely confused watching an animation showing a doll fly through a window, then get ripped apart and put back together again, then out the window it went.  Just a REALLY strange piece of animation.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.

The soundtrack is fascinating.  In fact it might be one of the best soundtracks to an animated film ever.  It's seriously THAT good.  Okay, Dumbo probably wins the award for best ever soundtrack, but Coraline is definitely a runner-up.

The music seriously reminds me of the mid 70's Canterbury scene involving progressive rock bands such as Hatfield and the North, Caravan and the Soft Machine.  Plus it's entirely melodic and just perfect.  I absolutely LOVE it.

The storyline is pretty good too, though incredibly simple and adventurous.  Just how a storyline *should* be.  A young girl bored out of her mind because her parents are too busy to spend time with her goes on an adventure of a lifetime right in her own home (by going back and forth through a secret doorway in the wall).

On the other side of the wall lies mirror images of her parents, but with buttons for eyes!  I kid you not, haha.  It's kind of scary in a way, but not intentionally so.

Overall, the atmosphere is definitely eerie, and the quiet tone of the entire movie might take a few minutes to adjust to, but in the end Coraline is a quality film for children and adults alike.",1278460800,,1714,4.582236842105263
7771007,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.

Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of ""Coraline,"" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous ""other"" world.

Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.

It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed ""other mother"" (Teri Hatcher) and matching ""other father,"" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.

At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.

Neil Gaiman's book ""Coraline"" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.

Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.

The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.

Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.

The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.

""Coraline"" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures -- definitely for fans of Gaiman, dark fantasy and really creepy stuff.",1278201600,38,3602,4.998330550918197

7771012,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Last year was rather wonderful when you consider the smart and engaging animated films that were released.  Between the Oscar winning `Up', Anderson's crack at animation, `Fantastic Mr. Fox' and the ghoulishly fantastic `Coraline', you have a spectacular year in this field that reigns supreme as the best of the decade.  While probably my least favorite of the three, `Coraline' is still one of the better films of that year and a definite must-see for any film enthusiast.

In tone, this film is far different than the other two I mentioned.  In fact, all three films are so different, and I think that is another reason why this year was so great in this field.  We were offered a variety of films that excite and entertain and appeal to different sides of our cinematic taste.

`Coraline' is dark and moody.  The production design here is simply flawless, brilliantly capturing the mood and feel of the film without going so overboard as to appear clunky and campy.  The attention to detail, whether it be with the characters or with the surroundings, is astonishing to look at.  Above all else, `Coraline' is a visual feast.

Still, looks aren't everything.

`Coraline' tells the story of a bored little girl.  Having just moved to an old house with her work obsessed parents, Coraline finds that she has nothing to do and no one to do it with.  Her parents are so confined to their work that they disregard Coraline as seemingly unimportant and her only companions are either crazy (the circus fare she lives beside) or annoying (a strange kid named Wybie).  When Wybie finds a doll that resembles Coraline, things start to change.  Coraline finds a secret door that eventually takes her to an alternate world where she has `other' parents, perfected variations of her own.  Coraline loves being in their company, but when they attempt to make her a permanent part of their lives things turn a tad ugly.

The emotionally chord behind `Coraline' involves the struggle to find balance in that parent/children relationship.  On both ends we can find ourselves working against unity.  It is apparent that Coraline's parents don't consider her feelings enough (they seem almost harsh on the outset) but it is also apparent that Coraline is your average selfish teenager (or pre-teen).  Sometimes we have to take a step back and see things through the eyes of our parent or our child in order to find that unity; meeting halfway so-to-speak.  Coraline learns that the hard way, but better late than never.

Visually stunning and emotionally profound, `Coraline' is smart and charmingly creepy.  It is not a film for everyone, and some children may find it a tad scary (some adults may even find it a tad scary), but that is the point of the film.",1273449600,4,2746,4.82051282051282

7771016,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline is a great story about discovery and consequences, and the 3-D works quite well--with a caveat.

There are two settings: ""real world"" and ""other world"" and when Coraline enters ""other world"" the 3-D can get a little overdone such that it is hard to adjust. But in some parts, even the true color (not the green and magenta images) doesn't track and can cause double images.

At the beginning, there is a doll that floats in from far away, and the 3-D is ""wide"" enough that the two images balk being resolved into 3-D. This happens regularly throughout the movie. Sometimes a tunnel that is stretching away will also stretch your eyes as you resolve the picture. It can be done if you are practiced with seeing ""Magic Eye"" images (this is a good site: [...]), but it can be a strain. I have had to stop and rewind or just pause and look at the scene again.

I am very practiced at the 3-D technique, as I have used 3-D machines to make contour maps from overlapping aerial photography pictures. My job required regular use of the 3-D technique employed in Magic Eye and 3-D movies.

Take the time to get acclimated to the 3-D vision by suffering through the ads. Also, if you can refrain from looking away from the screen--or obscuring your vision in either eye by up-ending a drink-- it will help preserve the 3-D effects. Stick a straw in your drink.

Fortunately, there is a 2-D version on the disk as well, and if you either can't see the 3-D or are tired of trying to resolve it, the movie is just as good in the 2-D version.

Coraline is very curious and brave in a movie that takes a bored and frustrated young girl on a journey into a fantasy world that entices--perhaps a little too much. Coraline is savvy and confident.  She uses her wits and pluck well to confront new situations and face danger head on. She stays true to herself and takes responsibility for her own actions and experiences. She's a great role model for children in my opinion.",1271030400,2,1965,4.456824512534819

--------------
Do you ever wish that you had two mothers, a Real Mother and an ""Other"" Mother?  If you had an Other Mother, what would she be like?  A girl named Coraline is about to find out!  Coraline had just moved to The Pink Palace and finds her life thrown in turmoil when she is trapped with her ""friendly"" Other Mother, who gradually shows her dark side and turns into a ruthless witch.

Coraline's overworked real parents are too busy to afford what she wants, so she thinks her caring, button-eyed Other Mother is the solution, but she is actually the problem!  Coraline's new dim-witted friend Wybie's black cat, whom Coraline nick-named ""Wuss Puss"", starts going into the Other Mother's world and begins to talk in a low, eerie voice.  Wuss Puss warns Coraline, but it is too late, the Other Mother steals Coraline's real parents.

Coraline must call upon courage she never knew she had to free her parents and herself to the outside world.
With amazing 3-D effect, ""Coraline"" is a spectacular movie, and for every scene, you want to know what happens next!

7771021,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I guess their holding out until they award it with Animated Movie of the decade. In my humble opinion, this movie was shafted at the Oscars because it wasn't from Disney or Pixar and CORALINE, is a threat to the animated movie market that has been monopolized by Disney/Pixar for...ever. Yet, CORALINE stands by itself as the kind of movie that will change the landscape of animation in the years to come. It doesn't need the publicity to pull this off. It does it with its quality and its magic.

Quiet simply, CORALINE is amazing. It may be slightly strange, and it may be slightly dark, but so was MONSTER HOUSE. It is a ghost/witch story for children. It may be slightly scary, but that is part of the fun of it.

I first watched it with a group of adult friends, in 3D (FOCUS was nice enough to release the 3D version, regular blu-ray & dvd blu-ray with special features with their first release, not the special secret overpriced edition 6 months later like some companies), and found it mind-blowing.  It was the first time that I had seen a 3D movie, at home, actually work.

So, my first inclination was that it was too scary for my 4-year old and probably too scary for my 9-year old. Yet, not soon after, the 9-year old asked for it and there they were, both of them, glued to the television like I had never seen. Most movies hold their attention for a while and they end up drawing or wrestling, yet CORALINE had them staring at the television the whole time, jaws open, floored.  Thirty minutes after it was over, they wanted to watch it again... and again... there they were, awe struck through the entire movie, just like I was.

Coraline tells the story of a little girl who is feeling gilted by her parents who are too busy with their lives to pay her attention. So, when she finds a secret door that leads her to an alternate universe, with attentive, loving parents who give her floats for dinner, she is enticed to say goodbye to the real world and join her alternative universe where everyone has buttons for eyes.

It's a classic that should be held in the same esteem and long-lasting category as Wizard of Oz and it will, at least in my home, be one of the most loved children movies of all time.",1270684800,,2221,4.4156479217603914
7771022,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Yet another movie based on the works of comic god Neil Gaiman(sorry, no Sandman yet), this stop-motion animated film was directed by Henry Selick, whose former works include The Nightmare Before Christmas and James And The Giant Peach. It was one of the few movies that he acted alone from Tim Burton from, but was much more successful than his bomb of Monkeybone. Gaiman's book Coraline was largely inspired by Alice In Wonderland, and I'd have say that this film made for a better fantasy/suspense movie for kids that the recent Tim Burton one.

Set in an apartment home in the midwest, Coraline is a bored girl whose family has recently moved into the old estate. After leaving all her friends behind from her former town, she finds her new crib to be slightly off. There's strange neighbors, an enigmatic stray cat, a chatty boy named Wybee(short for Wyborne)and a mysterious door in her living room which leads to a brick wall. One night, Coraline follows a mouse throught the door which leads to an alternate version of her house called the Other World. There, she encounters her Other Mother who runs it, who appears to be a friendlier doppleganger of her real mother. She cooks her lavish breakfast/dinners, introduces her to more entertaining versions of her already eccentric neighbors, and a silent copy of Wybee. However, Coraline soon realizes that this is all an elaborate trap, mainly because the cat in the Other World can talk and warns her. After O.M. tells her that can stay in this world forever as long as she gives up her eyes, Coraline runs away, but gets imprisioned with the ghosts of three other children that had given their souls to Other Mother, who is revealed to be a bedlam. As an extra insentive to get Coraline, she kidnaps her parents. The cat tells her to trick the bedlam into a game, so that she can free her parents and the ghost children. After facing the rather twisted residents of this nightmare as it unfolds around her, she has a final confrontation with Other Mother in her web. Coraline escapes, but the bedlam's hand makes it through to our side. Wybee helps bury the hand in a deep well, and then Coraline has a big garden party with the ""real"" members of her apartment building.

This was an exceptionally creepy movie, but in a good way. Henry Selick manages to make this a hauntingly great experience, and definately not one for toddlers to see before hitting the hay. It was all done painstakingly with a large group of devoted animators whose efforts really paid off in the final product. The use of 3D is well done too without being looked at like some kind of gimmick, although its effect while watching it on TV is debatable. Regardless, this film should add to Selick's ongoing career as he's now signed on with Disney to do more feature films.",1270598400,,2802,4.67004048582996
7771023,5,B01GWCB40Y,"My 6-year-old daughter and I saw this for the first time on HBO. I frankly would not have expected her to love this film as much as she does. I would have thought it too dark, weird and spooky for her, and I still think if she'd seen it for the first time on the big screen it would have frightened her. But now, she wants to watch it practically every day. Go figure. Most of her 1st-grade classmates thought it was too scary. I think it helped that we saw a ""making of"" featurette before we saw the film, so she was prepared for the dark turns of the plot as well as reminded that everything was animated from puppets.

But if your child can handle this film, it's a true masterpiece. The artistry is amazing -- I believe the scene where Coraline first encounters the other-worldly garden belongs in the recordbooks as one of the greatest animated sequences ever. The voice talent is flawless; I wouldn't have thought to cast Dakota Fanning as Coraline, but she ends up fitting perfectly.

I especially like the messages this film gets across. Some reviewers have taken away negative ""messages"" that, frankly, make no sense from someone who's actually seen the film. For me, in addition to the ""careful what you wish for"" tagline, the film demonstrates for kids that 1) having real parents who love you is more important than getting constant attention 24/7, 2) if something looks too good to be true it probably is, and 3) escapism can be fun but hiding from the real world is dangerous. It's this anti-escapism message that I find to be particularly valuable, as well as extremely rare in any Hollywood film, let alone a children's film.

Now if only the Coraline dolls weren't so ridiculously expensive and difficult to find. Of all the throwaway films that get merchandised to death, it's a shame no major toy company picked up the license for this film.",1269820800,2,1860,4.596385542168675

The animation is superb, the story is very intriguing (though I found the last 30 minutes to be a little bit disappointing), and it has enough edge to it to keep the cooler kids interested. I wish it was about 10 minutes shorter, but that is a small complaint.

Some people will have issue with the darker aspects of it and with the scantilly clad ""Moulin Rogue"" act performed by the eccentric neighbors, but it's completely harmless fun for the non-prudish crowd. My four year old girl LOVES this movie, and I think the character of Coraline (a strong, confidant , smart, and independent young girl who isn't a brat but isn't annoyingly perfect either) is wonderful.

FYI: Maybe it's too much for a six year old.

I think the reason I wasn't over impressed is that I really loved the book (Neil has written some books that I'm crazy about!) and I think this was a let down to the Coraline I had in my mind as I read his book.  Isn't that the way it usually goes?  If you read the book first, no movie can compare.

I bought the Blu Ray set and it looks and sounds fantastic, but the 3-D is disappointing as the color seems to be very off or washed out.

7771032,1,B01GWCB40Y,"Neil Gaiman is a hack who has spun a minor talent into a long and tedious marketing blitz. His stories are badly plotted and the characters are about as deep as a thimble full of water. The worst aspect of Coraline and writer Neil Gaiman's other film efforts, such as Mirrormask and Beowulf, are their soulless, morally bankrupt quality. Gaiman's stories are best suited to disaffected youth, who lack the depth or wisdom to realize their emperor has no clothes. Gaiman tosses stories together with little thought. Despite all of the amazing visuals, Henry Selick is crippled by Gaiman's heartless story. Coraline is strangely frenetic and incredibly boring at the same time. The lack of any moral compass in Coraline makes it awful and depressing, like touring the author's subconscious and a nasty one at that; miserable, vindictive, angry and filled with resentment and futility. I would beware of showing this awful film to children, because at it's core it is an existentialist diatribe about how pointless life is... give up and be ignored and abused by your parents or become a zombie with button eyes.

7771035,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Penned by Neil Gaiman, this clever little story has been translated into a movie courtesy of the same stop-motion animation seen in Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"".  Similar to those films we have a ""spooky, but cute"" look to everything--gloomy skies, lurid colors, and an odd assortment of supernatural creatures.

It appears that ""Coraline"" tries to be a horror movie for children, and at this it succeeds rather well: it has a fairy-tale theme revolving around wishes that go bad, sinister magic that comes from an eerie past, and dark secrets that test a child's resolve.  Without giving away too much of the plot, Coraline feels neglected after having to move to a new state.  She's dealing with work-at-home parents who don't want to be interrupted, so she tries to busy herself poking around the big old house they've moved into.  As she makes discoveries in their new home, Coraline has to choose between the life she has and the one she's being promised...and as always in fairy tales, such promises can come with a terrible price.  My ten-year-old daughter read the book to this movie, and indicated that while some minor parts of the story were modified, the changes made the story translate better to film.

This film is rated ""PG"" for some scary situations, and some of its visuals might be unnerving:  for example, while many of the creatures are not real, they ""die"" by disintegrating into piles of sand.  There are scary visuals reminiscent of ""Beetlejuice"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", such as malformed monsters or startling shots of things jumping out at the viewer, but nothing your kids would consider as ""gross"" or ""icky"" as the imagery in ""Corpse Bride"".  Smaller children may find some moments too scary or intense, but the 8-12 year old set will definitely get an enjoyable thrill.",1266796800,2,1852,4.92604501607717

Watching the behind the scenes features, you will discover that this entire movie was made by hand using stop motion animation. Stop motion has a certain quality that you just can't get out of a pixar movie. It's very organic and is really a hands on approach to 3D movies. Watching this movie in 3D on Blu-ray is far behind watching it on a regular CRT TV. I highly recommend it!

7771047,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Watching CORALINE, I was enthralled and puzzled. ""Exactly what audience is this type of animated feature shooting for?"" I asked myself. And it's not an easily answered one. On the surface, Coraline is an children's adventure story; the story of a little girl exploring her surroundings and finding a kind of Tim Burton-esque rabbit hole leading to an alternate reality. But dig just a bit deeper and you hit a rather frightening layer closer to the truth behind what might be perceived as a kind of heaven and hell. But which is heaven and which is hell? These are the questions that linger throughout the film...

Coraline's transplantation into a new home leads her to explore its surroundings. First bumping into Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happening/dp/B001DZOC3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happening</a>) she learns that their new house has a history. Death has lurked not far away and looking at the landscape one quickly gets a sense of foreboding. A black cat (voiced by Keith David,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000EWBKLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>) adds to this sense.

Coraline's parents Mel (Teri Hatcher,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dead-Girl/dp/B000MTFFO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dead Girl</a>) and Charlie (John Hodgman) don't have much time for Coraline, as they are trying to meet a literary deadline. So Coraline is left to her own devices and soon discovers a doorway to a much happier, alternate reality. Trouble is everyone there has buttons for eyes. But why?

The reality is rather frightening and ghostly. So this isn't something young kids are going to enjoy nor understand. But it does have appeal. And, dare I say, it has appeal on a more intellectual level, even though much of the story can be dissected rather easily. But what parts aren't can, and will, linger in your mind for some time.

This isn't&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B001EOQWF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>&nbsp;or some other cutesy Disney film. This is raw, unforgiving storytelling within a stop-motion animated feature with a clever design and nightmarish qualities. Think of it more along the lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas/dp/B001AIRUP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>&nbsp;and you'll be closer, but not quite there.

The dangers to Coraline seem real, not just physically but spiritually. And when you see Coraline's Other Mother and Father on the downside of the rabbit hole, you get a knot in the pit of your stomach that tells you everything may not turn out well for our heroine or her family and friends.

The voice actors all do an admirable job with special nods to Teri Hatcher as both Mel and the Other Mother. Her digression into this dangerous character were well played. And a big thumbs up to Keith David as The Cat. His voice was PERFECT and you really can't tell who's side he's on ...if any.

7771060,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline is a brilliant movie, and while it has the look of a Tim Burton film, it is superior because Selick is a better storyteller than Burton.  The characters are well developed, and the film has a dreamlike quality that is rare as it is compelling.

It is surprising how many reviewers never get past the dark aspects of the film.  One wonders what they would do with the Brother's Grimm.  It would be a little like someone missing the point of the story of David and Goliath, and can only obsess that, ""Someone got hit by a rock.""

And regarding the big-breasted performers...THOSE WERE COSTUMES...the real performers were thin, fully dressed, and popped out of those costumes.  The POINT was to illustrate how absurd adults look in the eyes of a child.  Amazing how this minor detail seems so elusive to those who are more entertained by misguided moral outrage than honestly watching the film before them.  The film's rating is appropriate.",1263945600,,947,4.766871165644171
7771061,4,B01GWCB40Y,"After Coraline (Dakota Fanning) and her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) move to the Pink Palace Apartments, Coraline becomes frustrated by her lack of friends and her parents not paying attention to her as they work on their gardening catalog. When she runs into her neighbor Wybie (Robert Bailee Jr.), he gives her a doll he found in his grandmother's house that looks just like her. Shortly after receiving the doll Coraline finds a small door in the wall of their apartment that opens up to a brick wall. But later that night jumping mice who seemingly belong to upstairs neighbor, The Amazing Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane), lead her back to the door where she finds an alternate world where her parents treat her like she longs to be treated. Each night she revisits this wonderful world only to eventually find out that it's not all it's cracked up to be.

It's often a preconceived misconception that Tim Burton directed A Nightmare Before Christmas. As much as Burton wanted to direct Nightmare, he was unfortunately too busy working on Batman Returns, and was forced to place Henry Selick in the director's chair. Since then, A Nightmare Before Christmas has become a classic, being played every year in limited release around the country. This time Selick takes on Neil Gaiman. Neil Gaiman has become a much revered science fiction/ fantasy writer having written such work as the novel Stardust, which was turned into a movie in 2007, and the comic book series The Sandman as well as Coraline. Writing stories that are uniquely original with his comics including visuals that are stunning and unique in their own right, Gaiman is the perfect writer to bring to the big screen. And if you're considering using stop motion animation there are few directors other than Selick that one can think of to bring Gaiman's work to the big screen with it's integrity intact.

After seeing Coraline, I have to say that I can't think of any other filmmaker other than Tim Burton that could have done this movie justice. The attention to detail, as it was with Nightmare, is meticulous. I generally have a little problem with not being able to completely escape reality when watching a stop-motion animation film, but with Coraline I didn't have much of a problem with that. With too much of this style of animation the director seems scared to make things dirty, gritty, and real, but Selick doesn't seem to have that much of a problem in this movie. That really aids this film as the real world Coraline lives in is a gritty world to her as opposed to the alternate reality she visits and, at first, prefers to her real life. The writing is, for the most part, impeccable despite a few clunky lines, crafting a unique story with characters that you feel for and are compelled to root for when their situations go awry.

Of course, with any animated movie the characters are only as good as the people who voice them. Here you have some great actors such as Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds, Man on Fire, I Am Sam), Keith David (Crash, Requiem for a Dream, Pitch Black), and Ian McShane (Deadwood, Kings, Sexy Beast). The voice actor that really stands out, though, is Teri Hatcher as Coraline's mother Mel Jones. As Mel Jones, Teri Hatcher doesn't just play the real world mother, but also the alternate mother creating a world for Coraline, luring her in to steal her soul. As Mel, Hatcher really makes you feel both sides of the coin of the character. She makes you feel that the alternate mother is the best fit for Coraline, but when you find out the truth she makes you despise the other mother and feel for the mother that you at first despised. This mixture of emotions for one actress to make you convey shows the brilliance of the performance as well as the visuals used by the filmmakers in the story.

Unfortunately though, later in the movie as Coraline searches for her parents and the souls of lost children the movie devolves into what feels like video game mode. The souls of the lost children speak to her as though she's a character played by the the director rather than feeling like an organic transition. This could have been a conscious decision by the filmmakers but it feels a little gimmicky. When I got to what I thought was going to be the end of the game that the other mother was playing with Coraline I honestly felt like I was playing a game of something like Mario approaching Bowser for the final battle. That would be great if I was playing Mario, but I don't want to be taken out of a movie with the feeling that I'm playing a game that I'm not really playing.

In the end though, I fell in love with the world and plight of Coraline. I'm still not sure if I will own it, but I think it would hold up greatly in repeated viewings. I do recommend this movie, especially if you like stop motion animation, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or somewhat gothic styles movies. Selick did a great job of translating a Gaiman classic to the big screen creating a unique and original film. Before you show the kids I highly recommend that you watch it yourself. While this may be stop motion animation there are scenes that may be scarier than you'd like your kids to experience and one scene of an older woman in extremely skimpy clothing.

7771075,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I love this movie so much and bought the collectors edition before the movie was released. I am actually slightly disappointed because the 3D version in fact, is not that great at all. Along with the movie, the ad said that there would be attached 3D glasses to watch the movie in 3D(which was incredible in theaters) but the glasses were the really poor quality paper with red and black lenses you would find in a cereal box. If someone was excited to see this in 3D, there is no hope. It degrades the movie with the glasses on. Also, even with the theater quality 3D glasses(don't ask how I have them) it doesn't seem to work at all because of a different 3D formatting I would assume.

However, the problems the glasses create for the 3D version are corrected in the 2D. For example, most of the reason why Coraline is so fantastic is use of vibrant colors. With the red and blue lenses in 3D, all you see is shades of red and blue. The colors in the 2D version are fantastically maintained theater quality.

The reason for my 4 star rating is because of the 3D version lacking so much and the glasses being completely useless. The 2D version is great, but the 3D version in theaters was better. Unfortunately, there is a slight difference in experiencing the movie in 3D.

There's even a catchy and clever song by ""They Might Be Giants"" complete with double entendre ""She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine/She's As Cute As a Button In the Eyes Of/Everyone Who Ever Laid Their Eyes on/Coraline"" (""buttons"" for the eyes of ""dolls"" being a characteristic of the belle dame's fantasy world).

The story of Coraline feeling neglected by her parents and enticed by an alternate world where everything seems better (emphasis on the word ""seems"") is great, but it may be a little scary for some kids (think ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" meets ""Alice in Wonderland""). There's also a hilarious but revealing costume of a bosomy downstairs neighbor during a theater scene in the belle dame's world, which may shock some parents, but I don't think anything else is too objectionable.

Beyond that, I should mention that this Blu-ray has THE best quality picture I've ever seen on the format! It's seriously hard to pull your eyes away from.

The 3D is nice for one showing, but spoils the color so you'll be watching the 2D version afterwards.

Lastly, the digital copy is something I'm a big fan of (so I can take the movie on my iPhone for my kids to watch), and this is pretty near to a must-buy in my view.

7771094,4,B01GWCB40Y,"To be honest, Neil Gaiman's novel left me a bit cold and not at all invested in the lead character of Coraline. This is one of those pretty rare instances in which I prefer the film adaptation to the original literary source. Because Coraline may still be not be as endearing as Dorothy Gale or Pippi Longstocking or even Helena from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mirrormask/dp/B000BT97AO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mirrormask</a>&nbsp;(also written by Gaiman), but at least the stop-motion animation looks absolutely cool and bizarre. CORALINE the film conveys the same uneasy and feverish vibe that was so palpable in the book, and I wouldn't be at all surprised that little kids upon seeing this movie end up with nightmares. The quick premise breakdown: a lonely little girl wanders thru a hidden door and finds a better version of her life. But is it really a better version?

The sense I got is that her parents are so distracted and neglectful that they couldn't even work up the energy to give her a proper name. Michigan girl Coraline Jones with her blue hair and her folks have just now moved into the Pink Palace Apartments and she doesn't waste time in exploring her new home. And what an odd home it is. Coraline soon runs into fellow tenants, an acrobatic foreign old gent perfecting a mice act and two seriously dog-loving old spinsters dwelling in the basement apartment. There's a mangy cat who knows more than it lets on. And then there's that peculiar door that's been painted over... and we know, don't we, that it won't take long at all before Coraline finds out what's on the other side of that door?

What she finds on the other side is a spooky length of tunnel which leads into a fantastic alternate world, and this world apes Coraline's new digs. But what's disturbing is that Coraline promptly encounters creepy mimics of her parents and neighbors. Instead of immediately perturbed, Coraline is instead equally bemused and enchanted because this set of parents, this Other Mother and Other Father, is fun and caring and attentive, showering Coraline with love and mouth-watering dishes and treating her to marvelous magical sights. Except that these parents have buttons sewn into their eye sockets. And then Coraline runs into warped counterparts of her real world neighbors, and even a version of that annoying kid Wybie (short for Wyborn). But everything seems so perfect and idyllic in this other dimension, and Coraline is so gratified to be the center of attention for once that she dismisses the worrying fact that people in this place HAVE FRIGGIN' BUTTONS FOR EYES! Inevitably, though, the doubts start to set in. And if she's not careful, Coraline may find herself forever trapped on the wrong side of the door.

Henry Selick, director of CORALINE, also directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-2-Disc-Collector-s-Edition-Digital-Copy/dp/B001AIRUOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare Before Christmas (2-Disc Collector's Edition + Digital Copy)</a>, and don't be surprised at how similar these two films are in terms of the surreal and exaggerated and unsettling animation. I dunno, to me, there's just something so fundamentally disquieting and macabre about people with buttons for eyes. The film also features wistful ghosts of dead children, victims of the Other Mother. And adding to the colorful parade of grotesque, we learn that the two nice old ladies, as nice as they are, tend to stuff their dead pets.

It took a while for me to warm up to Coraline Jones. She's a little mean and peevish, and she's not too nice to that kid Wybie. But she did win me over in the end as she demonstrates gumption when things take an alarming turn, and it doesn't hurt that Dakota Fanning provides the vocal talent. Meanwhile, Teri Hatcher does double duty as the Other Mother and also Coraline's real mom. CORALINE may not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy - in fact, it may throw you off your comfort zone - but it's certainly worth watching, for its memorable twisty visuals and its spindly, wildly imaginative characters. The glaring theme is parental neglect, but you can also draw out a pretty classic adage: ""There's no place like home."" Even if home is someplace as garish-sounding as the Pink Palace Apartments.

7771095,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline: 7 out of 10: Whom is this movie for is a question that dashed through my mind while watching it. It is too scary and adult for most children. The film is full of High Octane Nightmare Fuel and retired adult entertainment stars with naked elderly puppet breasts... come to think of it that is High Octane Nightmare Fuel as well.

As for the adults in the audience, I fear that in my case the film was too distant. I never felt emotionally attached to our plucky protagonist. In part because she is not a very nice girl (nor terribly plucky now I think about it) and partially because the film seemed to place her and her predicament at a distance.

On the other hand, I was floored by the sheer artistry of the film. Visually this is simply one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. Director Henry Selick who helmed such stop motion masterpieces as James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas has taken his art to a new level. Words simply cannot describe the visual delights that lie inside Coraline.

While I found the story somewhat distancing I also recognize the depth of the tale. Coraline's two universes mirror each other in a complicated web rather than a simply black and white as one might expect. The ocean here may not be that wide but it is amazingly deep.

7771096,1,B01GWCB40Y,"Ok.  I am going to get lambasted by other reviewers I am sure.  However, I write this brief review as a parent of two girls (3 and 9) and not that of a self-purported film critic.  THIS MOVIE IS DARK.  I mean dark in a manner beyond mere creepy at the 9 year old level.  This movie caused my 9 year old to start crying about half way through.  My 3 year old wanted nothing to do with it about three minutes into the opening scene and left the room.  She was apparently smarter than me.  I had to stop the movie immediately when my 9 year old started crying.

The opening scene alone was designed in such a manner I associated the scene with a movie about a dismembering serial killer or filicide (killing of one's own child). However, I dismissed these thoughts as being overly protective or analytical.  Big mistake on my part.  I should have trusted parental intuition and I would caution you to do the same.  Watch the movie yourself before you let your children near it.

Following our termination of the movie, I talked to my 9 year old about the movie for 10 minutes trying to prevent her from internalizing her feelings.  She had issues with the opening scene as well but did not say anything.  Her opinion is that the movie opened in a dark way but then became ""pleasant.""  However, at the point where the parents were insisting they would sew buttons into the eyes of their child she believes the movie was portraying ""something evil"" (her words).  The music is also noticably morbid in my humble opinion.

7771098,4,B01GWCB40Y,"What self-respecting kid hasn't, at one time or another, wished for a different set of parents - you know the kind who wouldn't make you brush your teeth or eat your vegetables, and who would let you play in the mud and stay up late at night and have every single thing your greedy little heart could ask for?  Well, Coraline finds just such an alternate universe lurking in the corner of the rundown Victorian home that she and her consistently busy and utterly self-absorbed parents have just moved into - a magical world hidden behind a secret locked door where mice dance, cats talk and duplicate parents cater to a beloved child's every whim and fancy.  But as the old adage says, ""Be careful what you wish for"" - and soon Coraline is discovering, much to her dismay, that this ""perfect"" world and these ""perfect"" parents may not be quite so perfect after all.

Based on the book by Neil Gaiman, ""Coraline"" is one of the most enchanting and visually arresting films to have come our way in quite some time.  Prime credit for its success goes to writer/director/production designer Henry Selick and his team of 3-D/stop-motion animation wizards who have created a world that is rooted in both reality and fantasy at one and the same time.  The triumph begins with the heroine herself, a feisty, naturally curious, no-nonsense kid whom any viewer, regardless of age, will be immediately drawn to.  As voiced by Dakota Fanning, Coraline is skeptical without being cynical, and her yearning for a mother and father who might actually pay a little attention to her could not be more universal in its appeal.  Like all good fantasies made for kids, ""Coraline"" finds its truths in its central character - in a lonely child who has been ripped away from her friends, and whose parents are so intensely focused on their own adult interests that they have no time to enter into the world of childish things that naturally concern her (people can`t even get her name right, since just about everyone insists on addressing her as Caroline).

But all is not sweetness-and-light even in the bright and colorful ""other"" world that  Coraline visits - not by a long shot.  For the movie taps into many of those primal fears - of abandonment, of being seduced by evil with promises of goodies - that loom large in many of our most cherished folk stories and fairy tales.  Thus, since ""Coraline"" does venture into some pretty dark places, it might prove more than a little disturbing for very young audiences.  Older kids, on the other hand, will likely enjoy the creepiness and will surely find themselves rooting on this imaginative and resourceful little girl as she uses her courage and intellect to outwit those who would cause her harm.

The animation is first-rate on every level.  The characters, with their sharp angles and spindly protuberances, look at times as if they'd just stepped out of a Tim Burton production - and the somber, nightmarish setting, with its dark skies and gnarly trees, conveys that impression as well (not really much of a surprise, actually, since Selick was the director of Burton`s ""Nightmare Before Christmas"").  Yet, ""Coraline"" never feels derivative of other movies; it is instead a wholly original and beautifully crafted work in its own right - and one you would be foolish and improvident in the extreme to miss out on.",1258243200,2,3349,4.789930555555555

7771102,4,B01GWCB40Y,"This is a wonderfully original and imaginative stop-motion animated rendering of Neil Gaiman's juvenile book of the same name. Dakota Fanning is the voice of Coraline Jones, an adolescent girl whose parents have dragged her off to an apartment in an isolated hilltop Victorian so they can finish writing a gardening catalog. Though bored out of her mind, she's also adventurous and self-reliant, and it's not long before she discovers the secret door hidden behind the wallpaper in the parlor that gives her access to an alternative world with apparently wonderful alternative parents. Of course (as a story like this requires), not all is as it seems in that distorted world. The other tenants include the retired circus man, Mr. Bobinsky, and the elderly Misses Spink and Forcible (and their wall full of stuffed deceased terriers), and a feral cat with very fixed opinions when it comes to rats, and who attempts to give Coraline good advice which she waits almost too long to listen to. The plot is classic cautionary (and rather dark) fairy tale and the character details and bits of business are classic Gaiman. [I note most of the one-star reviews are actually complaints about the rendering of the 3-D content. Frankly, I didn't even know it *was* 3-D.

But really, I enjoyed it, except when I tried the 3D side of it, I got some 3D effects showing from my Sony W40 - 100Hz LCD screen, but it didn't show the original colors and got me lost in the story when I try to focus on the effects. Plus, there are no (Arabic) subtitles on this DVD.

It's a good buy, but not if you want to watch 3D effects at home.",1257638400,2,596,3.83739837398374

The theme is dark and wonderfully done, weaving both Neil Geiman's book and Henry Selick's genius. I won't leave any spoilers, although I would recommend parents view this before letting their younger children watch it, especially if they frighten easily. There are some pretty intense scenes at the end!

Oh, and the 3D version is wonderful too, especially in Blu-Ray! I hate when movies are overtly 3D, to the point that watching them in 2D is very choppy and contains unnecessary scenes (Journey to the Center of the Earth, anyone?)

A little creepy at times, maybe, but nothing that will traumatize them, especially if you are right there watching it with them. We went to the coraline web site and our daughter loves the create-a-flower game. Seeing on the website some photos and videos of how it was made might make it more fun for your kids.

My complaint with alot of 3-D movies is that they fashion the movies around the effects at the expense of the story.  There's a story alright but the problem here is that when it's not confusing it's downright creepy.  Who were they targetting for this flick?  Little kids who might get the bejesus scared out of them?  Disaffected adolescents who glory in unsavory imagery?  Whatever!

7771107,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I would echo other reviews of ""Coraline"" - an absolute wow on the 2D BLU RAY image - but gimmicky, dark and blurry on the 3D version.

This is aimed at both the kids and their accompanying parents - childlike enough to capture the wee ones for two hours, but adult enough in other ways to keep us old-folk glued. My 11 and 15 year olds loved it, though I would say it might be a bit 'too' scary for children younger than that (it's quite sinister in parts - this is not saccharine Disney, but Tim Burton territory - and he rarely panders nor holds back).

Four flimsy card glasses are provided for the 3D version (you choose either 2D or 3D from the main menu), but as you watch it, they irritate and you're far too aware of them. Pixar's ""Up"" had proper 3D glasses when we went to see it at the cinema and they made a huge difference to both the quality of the 3D effect and the comfort (too busy enjoying the film to notice).

The 2D version couldn't be more different. The BLU RAY image is awesome - really bringing out the workmanship that went into each shot. The richness of the animation and the hugely imaginative way all the characters look in every single scene - it's all an absolute blast. The vocal work is typically ace too (Dakota Fanning shines) and the story of parents and their children straying apart is like a dark Brothers Grimm tale that will unfortunately ring too true for many. The extras are superb too. Shame the whole thing is let down by the 3D side of things.

To sum up - and despite some niggles - the gobsmacking beauty of the print, the great voice talent and the dead clever grown-up story make it all worthwhile.

This is one you'll watch again and again - and your kids will impress their friends with it.

The movie may be ""pleasantly dark"" for tweens, older children, and adults, but the concept of another alternate reality (with bad people scheming to take little children away from their parents) behind a little door in your house is probably too much for 2nd and some third graders (and yes, I should have known better).

This other place has a house similar to her real one and a mother/father that look like her real parents, but things aren't quite right; the house is too beautiful and perfect, the ""parents"" are too loving, and all the people in this world have buttons instead of eyes.  Her new ""other mother"" wants her to stay in this perfect world forever.  Then things get spooky.

I haven't read the book by Neil Gaiman, who's a terrific author, but I thoroughly enjoyed this creepy movie.  The portrayal of the ""other place"" is just right: at first it looks beautiful and enchanting, but things just start getting a little wrong and wronger.  The other tenants (the country house is split into apartments) are terrific characters; the theater performance of the old ladies in the basement is a scream.

The movie was done in 3D stop-motion animation, and it's the best I've seen.  The settings are so colorful and imaginative that for a while I thought it was computer-generated animation designed to LOOK like stop-motion.  The blu-ray includes both a 2D and 3D version (with the 3D glasses), but I haven't looked at the 3D yet.  Home theaters can't replicate the same 3D technology used in theaters so instead they do the ol' red/green glasses thing.  This REALLY screws up the colors which would be a shame in this very colorful movie.  In watching it in 2D, there are clearly elements that were added for an in-your-face 3D effect, but you don't really need it or miss it.

Critics have said this movie is too scarey for children.  What do I care, I'm 54.  People are always underestimating children's ability to process scarey fantasy anyway.

7771141,3,B01GWCB40Y,"The flat version of the film is very nice. A wonderful, very unique story, well told. A valid example of the animation 'revolution' that is truly effective. A clever story that isn't just an excuse for a gang of actors to get together and do voice-overs, stuck in some crazy premise; this was based on a children's book and had a reason for being rather than just silly fart joke laughs. The characters are believable, quirky souls, who seem exotic and interesting rather than the rubber-stamped kiddie flick creations we've seen so often.

The colors are realistic, and duplicate the overall feel of the original version. I'm not so sure that the Blu-Ray process is really needed as there is no need for the super contrast and dazzling color pallet that those discs provide. I haven't compared the digital copy with the Blu-Ray, so I don't know how specifically, they differ, but I image the difference is minimal.

The film itself is a charming little story with a lot inventive twists and turns and a spectacular visual style that survives on the flat version much better than the stereo one. I see that, apparently, UP won't have the 3-D option when it makes it's debut, later in the year. That is no loss, believe me.

The 3-D effects, which were so dazzling in the theatre, are lost on this disc. Although the process has been improved enormously since the fifties, the attempts used to duplicate it on video are the same very lame red lens/green lens process used on comic books of that era, and mid '70s tv broadcasts. It is ugly and more annoying than effective.

It is recommended that one allow one's eyes to adjust to the process, but no amount of waiting will help this look less than ugly. Just skip the 3-Disc and wallow in the loveliness and wit of the normal Blu-Ray version.",1252713600,,1792,4.6257861635220126

I got the 3D version, which also includes the DVD and a Blu-Ray 2D version and have watched both the 3D and 2D and both are simply amazing. While the 3D still has some limitations and it's not perfect in it's color, it was still worth it.

I had fun watching it and the story line, to me, was never boring. Although I'm an adult, I have no artistic ability whatsoever, so (stop motion) animation is really special and I can understand the work involved in something like this.
If you have little kids, though, you might want to view it before they do. At times it can get a little dark.

7771152,2,B01GWCB40Y,I was very disappointed in this movie.  Mainly due to the fact that for over 5 minutes there is a character who is hardly clothed at all.  And she's the one that the film focus on for over 5 minutes.  The lady is very big chested and has a tiny bit of covering over her nipples.  But the whole rest of her chest is left for everyone to see.  And she's wearing a thong!  I found this totally inappropriate for children.,1252540800,5,418,4.098765432098766

7771154,5,B01GWCB40Y,Tim Burton has outdone himself in this creepy clay animated movie from Neil Gaiman's book Coraline. Not only had he stuck mostly to the story but for once it's not a musical! I recommend this for all ages but make sure the younger ones have an adult cause it gets super creepy!!,1252281600,,278,4.365384615384615
7771155,4,B01GWCB40Y,"First of all I read the book so my opinion might be a little bias but overall I really liked this movie. I love this kind of animation which was exceptionally well done in this movie. It is very true to the book with some exceptions.
The blu ray version of this movie includes the 3D option with the 3D glasses. Let me note that this version is only on the 2ND DISC!!! When my boyfriend and I went to watch this the first time around in what we thought was 3D we soon lost interest in wearing the glasses because we unknowingly were watching the 2D version on disc 1.
Next I would like to say that this is a PG film and if you plan to allow your children to watch this I would suggest you pre-viewing it. For a younger child this movie might be a bit scary. After all the book was marketed to teens.
Finally I would recommend this movie to anyone who read the book, as well as those who enjoy similar films like The Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, or The Corpse Bride.",1252281600,2,991,4.139896373056994
7771156,5,B01GWCB40Y,"The Movie:

Let me just state that although I am an adult, I absolutely loved this movie, and think that it would be perfect for everyone of all ages. Director Henry Selick of The Nightmare Before Christmas fame and the incredibly talented crew at LAIKA have painstakingly crafted a beautiful world using stop-motion animation. You have to see it to believe how life-like and expressive these characters are while still keeping the colorful fantasy like qualities of a fairytale animation.

I think one of the reasons why the movie works so well is that even despite the wonderful medium it's been created in, the central story is something that everyone can relate to. For adults, it's about remembering what it was like to be growing up and their relationship to their own parents. For kids, it's about exploration, suspense, and maturing through courage. Watching the movie several times through also compelled me to go out and buy the original book by Neil Gaiman. Interesting as well and definitely worth a look if you're interested as the tale is spun somewhat differently. For those that have complained that the movie may be too frightening for young children, why not ask them their opinion first before assuming that they will be scared. The movie was obviously made for children, included two in the cast, and intended to be scary and fun for their age. Plus, that is a central theme in the story: for children to learn to overcome their fears.

Thank goodness, the creators didn't sell out by shoving a whole bunch of huge actors making ""hip"" or ""edgy"" jokes. This one is true to it's own story, and you will fall in love with each of the characters. Now that said, I should definitely mention that the entire voicing cast did a truly superb job: Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, John Hodgman (PC guy), Robert Bailey, Keith David, Jennifer Saunders, Carolyn Crawford, and finally Ian McShane who did the unforgetable- Mr. Bobinsky (said with a Russian accent). And the ""acting"" is really a two-part job as the stop-motion animators did a fantastic job in displaying the character's emotions and dialogue. You really do forget that your seeing only animated puppets and not living creatures.

The Collector's Edition Blu-Ray/DVD:

Outstanding buy! I highly encourage everyone (as I have with all my family and friends) to go pick this one up. The Collector's Edition is great and comes packed with very interesting behind-the-scenes and voicing sessions integrated into the Blu-Ray.

I bet a lot of people are probably wondering about the quality of the 3-D that is offered. The Collector's Edition comes with 6 green-magenta 3-D glasses. So obviously it will not be anywhere near as cool as what was presented in the theatres, but this should not deter you as this is the only way to display 3-D currently on TV's as the technology has to do with the projector not the data (there is talk that new 3-D TV's will be made for the future but this probably won't be available for several years to come).

Personally, I thought this was an outstanding bonus and I will shamefully admit that this was what made me interested in purchasing the Blu-ray (Something I have never done before- bought a movie before actually seeing it beforehand. Somehow, I never really knew or forgot about it when it was in theatres- too bad, missed my chance. Though I truly hope it will return to theatres for it's original 3-D as I'll definitely make it this time!).

Anyways, you should definitely watch the 2-D movie first with it's brilliant colors and subtle details. Then try it out a second time with the 3-D glasses- it's quite neat. Although most of the color is gone with this type of 3-D, some are still present which is actually used to accentuate certain things like Coraline's yellow rain coat! I should mention that some people have complained about getting headaches from using the glasses, but I actually got used to it. And it does work- pretty cool stuff. In fact, I hope this encourages other animated movies to include this feature. It's way too long to have to wait before 3-D TV's are released and even more before they become affordable!",1252195200,,4146,4.805049088359047
7771157,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I watched this movie with the 3D glasses that it comes with.... all I have to say this movie was great! So imaginative,creepy, beautiful, wonderful storytelling. I thought it had the right balance of dark where kids ages 8 to 13 would like it, other than that under 8 might find it a little scary. As a big movie fan and fanboy the animation was great, colors were vibrant where it needed and drab when needing to be drab. And watching it in 3D was a really cool. If you like Corpse Bride, Nightmare Before Christmas, beautiful imagery even if it is of animation kind then see this. Adults will enjoy it! My favorite character I have to say was the cat!

The glasses aer the old 2 color glasses and my eyes, and others who have watched it, never quite adjusted all the way.  The 3D became distracting actually.  In the movie theater the 3D was amazing!!!

We have seen so many other animated movies like this, but I was disappointed and a bit shocked by some of the content of this movie, from a parents perspective.

The BD movie is a significant upgrade from the DVD, although I believe the DVD video and audo quality has been deliberately undermastered downgraded to promote the BD package.

7771184,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline is a fine example of stop-motion animation at its finest; and one side of this DVD even has the feature length film in 3-D! The voiceovers are perfect and the animation is flawless; the story is quite captivating, too. I was fascinated by the plot and it never bored me. The musical score enhances the film, too.

When the film starts, we meet young Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) and her parents who are so busy writing for a gardening catalog that they have no time for Coraline. Coraline's angst is even stronger because they just moved away from their old neighborhood into a dilapidated old building called the ""Pink Palace Apartments;"" Coraline has no friends here. She does meet Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey, Jr.), a quirky young boy, although they don't hit it off too well at the very start. There are the downstairs neighbors Miss April Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Miriam Forcible (Dawn French), two eccentrics who provide light comic relief from the scarier parts of the plot; and there's Mr. Sergei Alexander Bobinsky (Ian McShane), the upstairs neighbor who worked as a circus performer in his younger days. There's also the neighborhood cat who sometimes tags along after Wybie.

Even with these new neighbors, things are pretty dull for Coraline; but things change when one day she discovers a door behind an armoire. Coraline begs her mother to open the door but they discover nothing but a wall of bricks! Coraline's mother brushes it off; but Coraline remains curious. She eventually discovers that the bricks hide a tunnel to another world just like hers--only much better. Her ""other parents"" are very affectionate and they anticipate Coraline's every whim; they spend time with her and she has lots of fun--there's even a circus act with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible that lets Coraline get in on the act! She's having a ball and she simply returns automatically to her real home after she goes to sleep in her ""other"" home.

But the third time Coraline goes to her ""other"" parents and her ""other"" home, things start to get creepy real fast. Coraline's ""other"" mother and father want to sew buttons into her eyes and keep her there for good! Coraline also discovers the souls of three children whose lives have been eaten up and destroyed by the ""other"" mother; now Coraline finally realizes what her ""other"" parents want from her. Coraline's ""other"" parents undergo just a slight change of appearance, too.

The plot can go anywhere from here. Coraline eventually gets back to her real home, but I won't tell you much about that so as not to ruin it for you. But what does Coraline do when she discovers that her ""other"" mother has taken and trapped her real parents? Can Coraline get her real parents back from this incredibly wicked ""other"" mother? Will the talking cat from the ""other"" world help Coraline or hinder her? Will Wybie help Coraline--and, if so, how? No spoilers here--watch and find out!

The DVD has an optional running commentary with director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais. In addition, one side of the DVD has a 3-D version of this film.

Coraline impresses me as a very good thriller that has outstanding stop-motion animation. People who enjoy thrillers, animated films, and pictures that use science fiction and fantasy to further the plot would do well to add this DVD to their collections.",1251072000,,3371,4.8539130434782605

7771186,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Sinfully inspired and darkly delivered, the story is wonderful, the art and animation are divine.  As Gaiman is well known to pen creepy childrens' stories, this one renders wonderfully as a moving picture.  In a decidedly grim parallel, Coraline goes down her own rabbit hole, to find that predictable, boring life with her parents isn't so bad.  The story is one I definitely will enjoy watching repeatedly.

However, the 3D version of this film at home was a lackluster experience.  The perspective was slightly off and only a few fleeting times did it gel correctly to actually convey a 3D effect.  For all its artistic quality the 3D version falls short and could easily detract from the splendor of the story.  Stick to the 2D version.",1251072000,,741,4.833333333333333

But as it stands right now, that was 100 minutes I'd like back and a thousand unpleasant images I'd like to return.

Breathtaking? Brilliant? I'm sure the stop-motion was a tremendous amount of creative work. So if it was, why would they go to all that trouble to make everything so damn ugly?  I'm all for macabre and dark, but most of the imagery in this movie was harsh, grating, uncomfortable and creepy - not in a good way.  There were only a few scenes that made me go, ""Oooo, wow"", and the rest was just ICK.  And what was the overall moral of the story?  ""Appreciate your neglectful and awful parents, because there might be soul-sucking murderous parents out there you could have instead""?  Sheesh.

As for the PG rating.... that seems rather lenient.  I'm 37 and felt like I needed adult accompaniment to watch this, lol.  A friend of mine has a young daughter who read the book, and after she did was so freaked out by it she said she never, never, never wanted to see the movie.

This has happened several times now in the past few years, and especially when they're available on a stunning Blu-Ray disc transfer.  (Note: three months after this, ""UP"" came out on Blu-Ray and surpassed this!! It just keeps getting better....)

 I'm talking about the 2-D version, not the 3-D (which is not even in the same ballpark.) Forget the 3-D glasses and watch this as you would any other movi. You'll be extremely impressed at the colors and detail, and maybe just plain blown away by it all.

Not only to the colors and detail dazzle, but the inventiveness here is really fun to watch and items change from one form or color to another. In parts, it reminded me of the old Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"" with its colorful cleverness.

To me, all of this made the story is secondary but that the latter isn't very interesting, too. The story is unique; quite different, with a good message getting everything you want not always being as attractive as that sounds.

The minor characters in this story, by the way: such as ""Mr. Bobinsky,"" ""Miss Forcible"" and ""Miss Spink"" - are a real hoot. and more fun than the main characters.  And - one last thing - adults mind find this more entertaining than kids.",1250726400,,1331,4.731601731601732

While the look of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas/dp/B001AIRUOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>&nbsp;wears with time, this is just perfectly smooth.  The colors are beautiful and the movement is gracious.  The film itself is disturbing in all the good ways, and the story is surprisingly dark and creepy considering it's essentially a children's movie.  The best way I can describe the feel of CORALINE is this.  Imagine if a creepier version of Pixar, known for making intelligent movies with strong themes that are thought-provoking for adults but still accessible for children, made a stop-motion flick.

A lot of fans, ignorant to the fact that Tim Burton PRODUCED&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas/dp/B001AIRUOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>, not directed it, will be fooled by the ""from the director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas/dp/B001AIRUOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>"" label on this film.  So it will definitely get the Burton crowd.  But, by and large, the story and visuals are superior to Burton's work.  Since it's adapted from Neil Gaiman's popular book, which I unfortunately didn't get a chance to read before I saw the film, you know you can trust to be told a delightfully creepy tale.  The movie does find a nice balance between keeping the visuals stunning and maintaining the integrity of Gaiman's story.

So far, this seems like a glowing review.  It's coming out that way because the film definitely has a lot going for it.  The animation deserves praise, the script is good, and the voice acting (which I haven't mentioned) is also great.  But, even at one-hundred minutes, this film feels way too long.  I was bored in parts, and felt that the movie could have lost fifteen minutes without losing a shred of its complexity.  I still enjoyed it, and wouldn't mind seeing it again.  Not sure if it's worth owning on DVD unless you're a huge animation fan or really dig Gaiman's work, but it's at least worth a rent!

The lead character of Coraline wasn't really all that nice, and it was hard to cheer for her, or even like her very much.

I was skeptical of the 3D effects, and disappointed that it was the ""old"" blue/red, now orange/green glasses, and not a ""clear"" technology like the movie theaters. I was pleasantly surprised by the 3D effects, they worked well almost all the time and enhanced the movie experience. I haven't watched it in 2D yet, so I can't say I ""lost"" an experience with ""full colors"", but I wasn't following the ""pink house"" thing (it was gray to me), so I certainly missed that! I did have some issues with ""losing"" the 3D effect and just seeing blurriness, but I'd suspect that was an individual thing. Overall I'd say it was good to see it in 3D and I'd do it again, but I suspect I'll watch it again more often in 2D.

As for the movie itself,I thought it had a good plot. I think their ending was slightly confusing, as both my wife and mother required clarification (but she always does, you guess which ""she"").

[First, a brief warning: The faint of heart should steer clear. If you or your kiddies don't want to be frightened or disturbed or enchanted, avoid ""Coraline"" at all costs! Let's just get that out of the way and move on.
Now, for those of you who thrive on dark and delightfully creepy fantasy, this movie is right up your alley.]

First of all, I fell in love with this story as soon as I plunged into the book by the wonderful British storyteller Neil Gaiman, who is cemented as an icon in the world of fantasy. I am an ardent fan of children's fantasy tales, horror, and all things British... so, I was charmed to the hilt with this dark and wondrous tale. And now there is a fanastic movie to enjoy.

This stop-motion movie does the book justice, totally. The character designs, sets, lighting, cinematography, lovely musical score-- everything is very nicely done. You can tell that a lot of work went into this movie. There is plenty here to entertain everyone, and enough peril and danger and scary stuff to satisfy folks like myself who enjoy a good villain and some macabre trappings. Maybe you have to be a fan of all things creepy to appreciate ""Coraline"". I just happen to love scary films, fiction, and ideas.

The character voices are terrific. Teri Hatcher is very effective as the Other Mother and the real mother. Dakota Fanning, Ian McShane, Dawn French, and Jennifer Saunders all contribute quite nicely.

If you (or your family) have a penchant for fantasy or horror, this is for you. (And if you're into animation, all the better.) It smacks of the best Roald Dahl tales, of Alice's wild adventures in Wonderland, and of classic horror movies I grew up loving.

Henry Selick does a top notch job directing this movie, which pulls you in quickly and takes you on a spooky and colorful ride. Certain things will stand out for you, as they did for me: the opening credits sequence which shows scenes of the Other Mother creating the doll... the enchanting and gorgeous garden in the Other World... the audience of black Scottish Terriers watching Ms. Spink and Ms. Forcible's show... and the emotional core of the story, too.

Part of the pleasure for someone who has read the book is seeing these scenarios that were previously only within one's imagination; now they come to life on screen almost magically, and it's the next best thing to revisiting the book.

I didn't mind that the setting was changed from England to America; I guess Hollywood still thinks we can't handle that so much. No big thing. I thought the addition of the Wyborn character actually worked well in the story; In the book, Coraline talks to herself a great deal, and I suppose that does not work well on film, so they added a character to help with exposition and to help Coraline in her quest.

All in all, this movie is a winner.",1250467200,3,2837,4.601980198019802

I saw this film as an allegory for drug addiction. Coraline starts out feeling low and powerless; then she visits her ""other mother"" and ""other father"" where everything is wonderful and she feels euphoric. But as the story unfolds, the euphoria fades and Coraline's situation becomes terrifying and dangerous, with her parents freaking out.

7771204,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline is one of those movies that you have to open your mind a little when you watch it and allow yourself to immerse yourself in the creepy and odd world the story takes place in.  The style is very pretty yet creepy if that makes sense.

This young woman has a less than ideal family life and she is left longing for more.  There is a doll that she is given which is very very old yet looks exactly like her by some chance.  The doll and Coraline explore the house until she discovers a world where it looks just like hers except everything seems perfect, including her 'other' parents that are everything her parents are not.  Coraline is a strong hero who faces tough decisions and must re-evaluate things in her life to move forward.  As the move progresses we share her journey and her adventure as she tries to figure out what the deal is with the doll that looks like her and the 'other' world that seems perfect.

Our family loved this movie and it looked amazing on Blu Ray.  I was on the fence with this one but it delivered and its one of my favorite movies I have seen this year with a unique and wonderful plot, great voice acting, great animation, and a creepy unique yet familiar world that brings it all together.

7771205,1,B01GWCB40Y,"I sat down with my teenager last night and watched this movie.  I was looking at the cover and reading the rating of PG and thought... 'hmm this doesn't sound too bad, maybe my little one could have watched it with us'.  I am so glad I didn't let that happen!  This was a horribly scary movie.  To not rate it PG-13 implies that it would be fine to watch with the whole family with children less than 13 and, because it is animated, possibly even include children as young as four or five.  But please do not be mislead into thinking that!  The subject matter and content of this movie should not be viewed by children younger than 13!

The main character Coraline, is understandably mad and depressed because her parents have no time for her and pay no attention to her, but she takes it out on every one around her, especially ""Wybie"".  Wybie is a little boy who lives near the house Coraline just moved into.  Wybie is short for Wyborne, which when Coraline yells at him to go home, changes his name to ""Why Were You Born!""  Children hear that so often from the bullies at school, they don't need to hear it validated, condoned and encouraged on the big screen!

This movie is very similar to Alice in Wonderland in weirdness.  The cat talks.  Flowers come alive attacking and grabbing at you.  Bugs are oversized, becoming chairs and wardrobes.  Coraline has to open a small door and travel through a tunnel to get through to the other side.  Other characters are far out, speak in riddle or rhyme, disappear and pop up out of nowhere.  Cute mice turn in to nasty rats.  A circus performer dances around strangely and is obsessed with eating beets.

There are so many oddities included in the movie, in addition to the ones I listed above, that I just plain don't understand.  In a theater, to watch a performance, the entire audience is Scottish terriers sitting on plush theater seats.  Two women live together and at one moment you wonder if they are a couple.  One women is old and uses a walker.  The other has super skinny legs but HUGE breasts.  Which at one time they show her completely nude wearing only a thong and pasties doing a dance on stage!

The movie deals with witch craft, ghosts and voodo-like dolls.  The two women believe in reading tea leaves.  Coraline is presented with a doll that resembles her which we find out later is how the ""other mother"" spies on Coraline.  While Coraline is in the other world she gets thrown into a mirror by her ""other Mother"" which puts her in a room without an exit.  There she meets the ghosts of three children who had lived and died in this other world.  The ""other mother"" turns from a very nice woman to a very angry spider like, skeleton like, robot like, thing.

This movie is full of adult content.  There are a lot of scary, really freaky images.  Lots of anger.

I believe this is just one writers warped idea of a story.  The writer must have been on drugs or was in an altered state of mind.  I don't know how the movie ever became reality or how the book was ever published.  But this is not a movie I would recommend at all.  Even if you look beyond the weirdness and scary images, the story is just not there.",1250035200,19,3184,4.388698630136986
7771206,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I loved this film adaptation of Coraline!  If you like creepy movies that are also brilliantly imaginative, artistically beautiful, full of wit and good writing, this is the movie for you!

As most folks know, this story is about a little girl who feels neglected.  The family has just moved to a new area, and all her friends are, of course, left behind.  In the film, there is a little boy that helps with the explication, and sets up the creepiness of the old house (divided into flats) in which Coraline now lives.

Coraline finds a door to another world with a sort of ""duplicate"" family, one that pays more attention to her.  What will happen?  I don't want to say more!  But it is a wonderful story.  Actually, it is difficult to say what is more fantastical in regards to her neighbors:  They are just as interesting in the ""real world""!  Absolutely wonderful, over the top, voice characterizations.

A member of my family has a phobia regarding buttons (this is really true!), which play a certain part in the film, and still found the film entrancing!

7771207,5,B01GWCB40Y,"When the movie started my first thought was - Tim Burton. The feel of the creatures, characters, effects, set, etc. was very reminiscent of Nightmare Before Christmas and the like - and seriously, the darkness that comes out in Coraline has a similar feel.

PLOT: Coraline (not Caroline as many characters try to call her) finds herself in a rented home with a mysteriously secret door in the wall that leads to a parallel world - a parallel world that is dark and devilish. It's also a parallel world where everyone's eyes are buttons. Don't ask me why they are buttons - that was one of the mysteries of the movie that I never understood.

Coraline must first figure out what is ""wrong"" in the parallel world, then figure out how to fix it, or perhaps get back to the safety and potential boredom of ""reality"".

CHARACTERS: My favourite character was the cat. The creature was elegant, playful, offered both comic relief and insight, and was simply fun to watch. The animators spent a lot of time on that one and it was well worth it. Coraline was an interesting one - I didn't like her at first because I found her voice and her personality a bit irritating - but as the movie progressed and she discovered new things and grew, I found myself liking her more...even her wild blue hair. As for the other characters you will find a few women with VERY exaggerated breasts. It's not done in a sexual manner so you don't need to worry for kids, but it's very humorous (and you'll recognize the voices of Jennifer Saunders & Dawn French).

ANIMATION: Superb, simply superb. The colours were vibrant and rich, the detail was amazing in even the smallest detail like a cat's whisker. Very impressive and stunning - as I said before, the cat was really quite cool.

OVERALL RATING: I'm giving the movie 5 stars. My initial dislike of Coraline went away quickly, the detailed animation and very well written story made for a delightful evening. Even the minor issue of me not fully understanding the concept of the button eyes does not detract from the movie.

These movies had less sinister plots, and were good enough for the entire the family.  Coraline isn't one of those movies that most parents would want their children to watch.  I guess it's one of those movies that you either really like, or don't like.",1249948800,,498,4.369565217391305
7771209,5,B01GWCB40Y,"""Coraline"" is rather witty and very charming, yet also creepy at the same time. The story is about a girl - Coraline, not Caroline - who dislikes her parents, as many kids her age do. She doesn't like the boy next door either, or his cat, but still she doesn't come across as a brat or anything like that. Soon after the family moves into their new house, she discovers a little door which leads to a parallel version of her world with parents which appear to be much better - they want to spend time with her, treat her nicer, and cook better food. However, these ""other"" parents have another noticeable difference - they have buttons for eyes. Coraline soon discovers the hidden horrors of the parallel world; it's some of these scenes that might not be good for the little kids due to how scary they can be.

I watched the movie in 3-D wearing the glasses included and while there were many scenes with things standing out, I think next time I'd rather watch the 2-D version. The colors obviously weren't the same and the effects didn't quite grab me enough. I don't think you can go wrong either way though. One of the amazing things about the movie is the effort which went into its making. The ""making of"" shorts included on the disc were very interesting, showing just how much work goes into a stop-motion movie and how they hand-made everything for this film. I think the hard work definitely paid off - the presentation of the film (2-D or 3-D) is impressive, nicely complimenting the charming story and wonderful voice acting.",1249948800,3,1537,4.548736462093863
7771210,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I did not see Coraline in the theater, but I decided to give this movie a try after hearing some buzz and for the simple fact that I enjoy stop-motion animation.  Coraline is an entertaining and quirky film that tells the tale of a young girl who just moved in to a new apartment with her parents.  However, this isn't just any apartment.  Coraline, being the independent, headstrong girl that she is, finds a small doorway that leads to a parallel universe, and after she ventures inside things get really odd.

The blu-ray version of the film looks very good.  The amount of detail and color saturation is fantastic.  I don't think it looks quite as good as Corpse Bride, but it's about on par with The Nightmare Before Christmas.  The 3-D version of the film is fun to look at, for a while.  I couldn't watch the whole movie in 3-D because the included glasses were a strain on my eyes.  It does work though, and it's a novel addition to the package you're getting.  I just won't be watching the entire film that way.

As a film, Coraline mostly works.  It's an interesting story, but it didn't totally grab me.  Perhaps children will get more out of it than I did.  I'm not sure it would be a good film for very young children (4 or 5 years old) to watch as some of the images could be scary.  I do believe that girls in the 8 to 12-year-old range will likely enjoy this film and identify with Coraline's character.",1249948800,,1419,4.362595419847328

""Coraline"" is basically a darker ""Alice in Wonderland"" with much worse things waiting on the other side of the ""Rabbit Hole""(here, a tunnel behind some wallpaper). Director Henry Selick, who's only previous directorial works comprise of ""the Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"", adapts the book written by Neil Gaiman extremely well, keeping the creepiness intact. If you have kids, at least let them see the movie around the age of 6(the age Gaiman's daughter was when he first read her his book). No one takes such a predictable moral and ending, and makes it worthwhile like Gaiman. In fact, parents are known to be more likely to be scared by this movie than kids. Depending on how old you are(and your outlook on life), you'll either see this as a wonderful, empowering story, or a truly terrifying one. The thing that makes parts of thisith movie (conceptually) disturbing is it's story, which makes it scarier than most horror films of recent years.

The blu-ray's visuals are top-notch, with sharpness, vibrant colors, and very good black/white ratio. The DTS-HD audio track is excellent, with everything heard clearly, and nice use of surrounds for atmosphere. With 3 pip tracks, BD-Live connectivity, all the bonuses on the standard dvd, and a DVD of the film(forget the digital copy.

7771216,3,B01GWCB40Y,"My husband and I rented the dual sided version of the film a couple days ago as well as bought two pairs of the dual color 3D glasses.

The film was absolutely beautiful designed and animated. It was also delightfully balanced between trippy and creepy. I'd definitely say that if parents have young children, they should preview the film prior to showing it and use their personal judgment. The narrative has the same threads of menace that haunts original Brother's Grimm tales. The film at times can be rather disturbing. My husband and I humorously traded off with the line, ""That is messed up!"" several times through out the film. My only critique with the film is that the resolution falls too swiftly and maybe too neatly into place.

The reason my review is three stars is that I fail to see the reason behind packaging the DVD with a 3D version of the film. Even on a HD plasma with unimpaired vision, the dual colored glasses just did not work for me at all. I knew going in that the home television would lose the incredible effect of what dual projection in a theater could create, so I didn't have high expectations. I was merely curious if the industry had gotten better at implementing it over time.

I went in to watching the 3D version expecting to at least get a sense of scene depth similar to an old school View-Master. Unfortunately, I didn't even get that. None of the 3D effects worked for me. Even with a darkened room, my eyes would water while they constantly fought to refocus and make sense of the dual colors. I had to stop watching after about twenty minutes in, because my eyes were just exhausted. The 3D versions also dulls the color scheme. This really doesn't do the original film justice at all. It was rather shocking to see the vivid color difference switching from 3D to the 2D version.

The experience of watching it in 3-D at home, however, was not as enjoyable. It was  markedly different from the 3-D I saw in theatres. Even after following the prescribed optimal viewing procedures (keeping the room dark, setting picture mode to ""standard,"" letting my eyes get adjusted) I found the 3-D to be terribly desaturated in color, fuzzy, and not terribly effective. In the movie house, the 3-D was seamlessly integrated into the film and added texture. At home, it became distracting and fuzzy, and didn't do justice to the photography. By all means buy this movie, but I'd recommend seeing it in 2-D.",1249171200,7,783,4.8
7771221,5,B01GWCB40Y,My 9 year old son and i watched this movie together and it was just awsome! I really enjoyed watching it!! They say its not for kids but i think its good for older kids and up..like per say 8-9 and up. My son luvs it too! My eyes didn't leave that tv screen for 1 min!! Grrreat movie!! Tim Burton did it again!!!,1248998400,,312,3.890625
7771222,3,B01GWCB40Y,I loved the movie itself. Its a good story line (even if it is a little alice in wonderlandish) throught the rabbit hole (the door) creepy cat that dissapears when it wants to (the cat) and even the evil queen. Aside from that awesome movie and i love alice in wonderland so this is just another to enjoy. The three stars are for the reason of the 3-d. IT BLOWS It gave me a headache and even thought we had the room pitch black it was terribly blurry and just not fun. I thought the 2-d versions was more 3-d. Also this isn't the typical 3-d. nothing comes out of the screen at you at all. The only purpose of it is to give the movie some more depth. This failed as it was just mostly blurry and when it did work it still was shaded blue and red due to the glasses which just made me wish to have an antenna to adjust the film. Needless to say i switched the film to 2-d a third of the way through and will probably not ever watch the 3-d version again. The company could just put the 2-d on the disc and sell it for $10 or just sell the 2 disc for the amount of the single edition. Loved the movie hated the 3-d.,1248912000,3,1114,3.9555555555555557
7771223,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Wildly imaginative, intriguing, and delightful, Coraline is not a kid's film. It's an animated film for adults and it's dark in nature. To say that this film is creative wouldn't do it justice - Neil Geiman and Henry Selick have a vision beyond anything previously seen on the screen (although the opening sequence is very much an homage to The Nightmare Before Christmas and is reminiscent of Corpse's Btide). I can imagine rewatching this dark tale over and over and gaining something from it every single time.",1248825600,,513,4.908045977011494
7771224,3,B01GWCB40Y,"I loved seeing this movie in the theater with digital 3D, but the old fashioned green/orange version you get with this DVD wipes out the color and did little to enhance the film with the feeble 3d effects that were provided.  If it makes a difference, I watched it on a large flat screen monitor.  So, the bad news out of the way, the movie was great.

The film is creepy in the halloween aesthetic so favored by Tim Burton, but done here with a bit less of the macabre than in ""Nightmare Before Christmas"".  The ""other mother"" turns out to be a spidery creature with the typical Burtonesque mechanical hinged hands, and rag dolls populate the ""other world"", and when they are dispatched, they don't bleed, they lose sand.  The film is set in Oregon, and to a point manages to suggest a bit of the misty romance of the western part of that soggy, mountainous state.  But for all the sets and effects, it's the story that carries this film.  And the story, despite the near relentless gloom and creep, is quite positive.  A lonely girl, transplanted from Detroit (where you would think she would have at least some relief at having escaped) to the Oregon countryside by her self employed, and self absorbed writer parents, finds a secret door to a mirror-image apartment, and a mirror image family that is everything hers isn't, including not real and very dangerous.  It seems the ""other mother"" also referred to in the film as ""the beldam"" an archaic word for an old hag (although she hasn't that characteristic at all) creates a fantasy world to draw children to her, then she sews buttons on their eyes (they don't go into detail on this) and locks them behind a mirror where she eats their life (or their soul, the film says life, which seems odd).

Along comes Coraline who, unlike the three other kids who fell afoul of the beldam, decides she's not that lonely, and fights back.  Given all the time and energy it took to get to that point, the film resolves itself a bit too quickly from there, for my tastes, but it does it so well; a nice bit of chocolate or fine cheese that was portioned a bit too small, and there isn't any more as you find out afterwards...  The thing about the two worlds in this film, is that it isn't just Coraline's family that gets the treatment.  The old Russian acrobat upstairs and the two burlesque performers downstairs also have star turns in the ""other world"" that really delight the viewer.  I managed to find a review on a ""family"" website that was very good, until it got to the nudity part...  I'll mention that because they did, as apparently it's an issue for some people.  In the burlesque scene, in a vaudeville theater that the ladies apartment becomes in the ""other world"" they do what they did when they were younger, except that now they're not, and they're very, very out of shape, but you do have two stop-animation figures cavorting about in a vaudeville burlesque routine about mermaids and sirens, and one of them is but for the saving graces of glittering pasties and g-strings all but naked.  And then, the women materialize in their more youthful form, in show-nothing one piece bathing suits that would have made Mr. Hayes proud, and there you are.  I'd hate to think I ruined your day if I led you into a purchase that has partial stop animation nudity among the clay-rines.

So, I heartily recommend the film, and just as heartily suggest you watch the 2D version as it seems to be enhanced (ala ""Roger Rabbit"") such that it has greater depth without having 3D.  The 3D, in the theater, was not so much the hatchet flying off the screen variety of old, but added a degree of depth and realism to the story.  I wonder if one brought home the glasses from the theater, one would have better results with the 3D here?  And then I ask, why aren't the live action films this good?",1248825600,5,3840,4.510822510822511
7771225,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I got the DVD of ""Coraline"" today and had to look at it.  The 3D is based on the Red/Green system - not polarized.  The upshot is that although the effect is there it picture is dim/muted by the glasses.  I found it hard on the eyes.  Also, the effect is less pronounced than in the theater.  All in all, the 2D version is better for home viewing.

That said - it is a great movie!",1248825600,10,381,3.9473684210526314
7771226,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Henry Selick, best known for ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (1993) and ""James and the Giant Peach"" (1996) brings his talent for stop-motion animation to this adaptation of Neil Gaiman's children's novel ""Coraline"". Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is an 11-year-old girl whose family has just moved into an apartment in a slightly dilapidated Victorian house. While her parents are busy finishing up work on a deadline, and it pours rain outside, Coraline is bored. Then she discovers a small door in the living room that has been papered over. At night the door leads to another house like hers, only better, with more attentive versions of her parents and perfected versions of her eccentric neighbors. Her Other Mother (Terry Hatcher) invites Coraline to stay in the other world, but there is high price to pay, and Coraline begins to suspect something sinister.

Stop-motion animation was the choice for this film because it ages well. I couldn't agree more. ""Coraline"" looks fantastic and distinctive. It leaves a strong visual impression. I was reminded of ""The Mascot"" (1934), an early example of stop-motion that is as strong today as it was 75 years ago. I have not read the novel ""Coraline"", but I understand that the film has made significant changes, including that addition of a prologue in which we see mechanical hands creating a doll of Coraline. I'm grateful for that sequence, as it contains some of the film's most memorable animation. Like so many children's stories, there is a lesson imbedded in the tale. The film's tagline is ""Be careful what you wish for"". In the Other World, everything is exactly how Coraline would like it, for herself and for others. But it makes her value her real family all the more.

There has been a lot of discussion about whether ""Coraline"" is actually a children's film. It is not graphic; there is no blood or guts. There are disturbing ideas which are enhanced by creepy imagery. I would caution that it is probably too scary for children under six. For 6-10-year-olds, it is an entirely individual matter. The book on which it is based is fantasy/horror intended for 9-12-year-olds. Some children like to be scared, and if your 8-year-old is one of those kids, ""Coraline"" might be just the thing. If your child is sensitive, you may not want to cope with the nightmares. It's a nice film for older children, because it encourages children to be bright and independent and never condescends to them. It doesn't have the thematic sophistication that makes many Pixar films equally suitable for adults. But ""Coraline"" is visually interesting enough that it won't bore adults either.

The DVD (Universal 2009 single disc edition): The single disc edition has the 2-D film on one side of the disc and a 3-D version on the other. It comes with 4 pairs of glasses for viewing the 3-D. This isn't the same 3-D as was in movie theaters. That technology is not available for home viewing, so this version is the old blue-red 3-D. There is an audio commentary by director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais on the 2-D side of the disc. This is a constant, information-packed commentary. Selick talks about the changes he made to the book, the look of the real world versus the other world, and a lot of technical information about filming and working with the puppets. Coulais joins the commentary near the end. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish, French.",1248825600,10,3465,4.889455782312925
7771227,4,B01GWCB40Y,"I loved this movie!!! It was so creepy and definatly a Neil Gaimen story. The story was very well written, and had that ""the grass is always greener"" metaphor. It was amazing to watch in 3D, the effects were stunning and not cheesy as other 3D movies have been in the past. It stands up well in 2D also which makes this worth the purchase.

Now, why I think it is not as much a famliy movie as lead to believe. I have my first child on the way and I tend to view things a little diffenetly. This is not something I am going to let my kids watch till they are much older. It is very creepy and dark which might not be sutable for young children. There is also a scene were the two elderly ladies put on a theater type show and one of them is practically naked with what seems like paint or pasties covering the sensitive areas. I almost felt that for that alone it should have warrented a PG-13 rating. My suggestion and it is only a suggestion but I would not let my kids watch it without viewing it first myself. When my son is born It will be several years later before I let him watch this.

7771228,3,B01GWCB40Y,"When I purchased this Blu-ray I did extensive searches on review trying to figure out what type of glasses they used for the movie and nobody talked about them. When you look at the outside of the case they show cardboard glasses with what looks like they grey style lenses you get at the movie theater. So I was interested to see if our glasses we kept from the theater would work. Upon getting the movie last night and opening the case i was very disappointed to see that they were using green and pink lenses instead of the grey lenses they showed on the cover. We watched the first 10 minutes of the movie because they said they it could take up to 5 minutes to get use to watching the movie with the glasses. As soon as the movie starts Coraline looked like her hair was green for the whole time we watched in 3D even though when i took of my glasses i could see that her hair was blue. When we switched to the 2D version and got through the opening credits we noticed that they were showing a whole different scene then where the 3D version starts. In the 3D version it starts with Coraline looking out the window at the rain and getting a package from Wybie. But in the 2D version you see them unpack the truck and Coraline go up the hill to the hidden well where she meets Wybie for the first time.

I give the Blu-ray a 3 star rating only because the 3D was so bad and they left out a very important part of the movie in the beginning. Other then that the 2D version gets a 5 from me. I loved the story line.",1248825600,,1517,4.107744107744108
7771229,1,B01GWCB40Y,"As an illustrator, I have to send a strong warning.  THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN.
  This is a demented vile film being aimed at children as young as 11 years old. It's one of the most psychologically disturbing twisted films I've ever seen. It looks superficially like a benign animated film, but in reality, you discover it's an animated film wrapped around darkness, evil, voodoo, violence and insanity. Please,consider strongly whether to let a child see this sick flick. If you read the editors summary, please note the clear mention of ""dark and creepy,"" ""demonic grins,"" ""disturbing and intriguing"".  Sound like an R rated horror movie?  I happen to love horror movies, but films such as those are not aimed at children nor should they be.  THIS IS NOT CINDERELLA'S EVIL STEP MOTHER.  It's so much worse. It's a demented story about a hideous evil entity trying to get a child.
  Sometimes artistic freedom is confused with license. In this case the producer has used artistic ""License,"" to make a film that is sick and warped...and yes, disgustingly aimed at children.
  In this film, a core element is dolls that are created by an evil being to look like characters being chosen for exploitation...isn't that a voodoo doll?  Oh, and how about the idea of sewing buttons into a live child's eyes, ""It will only hurt a little."" This film made, ""Blue Velvet,"" look like a tea party.
 Love your children.  Guard your children. This is Hollywood once again spewing their twisted dreams on the public.  In this case, aiming vilely at children.

7771230,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I was let down when I saw the paper glasses that it comes with. I was expecting clear, transparent 3D glasses but the glasses that it comes with have Pinkish and Greenish lenses.
 But after watching the movie with glasses I found that they worked pretty good. I haven't seen Coraline 3D in theatres, but I was blown away with some of the 3D scenes.  The glasses do take away the bright vibrant colors (not too much though, Coraline's bright orange coat and Blue hair were still vibrant) but add a completely new feel and mood to the movie that's very appropriate for it.
 Some people have said that only a few selected scenes are in 3d. I didn't feel this at all. The entire movie was in 3D. Maybe a couple close up scenes where there wouldn't be too much depth to begin with may be 2D, ( I don't know) But the rest was completely 3D.
 I watched the movie on Blu-ray and on an HD TV. That's the only way to get the best picture possible.
 There are almost 2 different version of Coraline. The 3D and the regular versions. They both create two completely different experiences. When watching in 3D, you feel like you've been transported into  a different world that's gloomy and dark. In 2D Blu ray, you get to observe the same world with rich details that aren't visible in the 3D.

One thing i never liked about this movie is the fact that the ALWAYS advertise this movie with 'From the director of Nightmare Before Xmas."" This implies that this is a Tim Burton film and/or that you should see this movie if you liked Nightmare Before Xmas, which i find to be false because they are not that similar.

NOW the 3D in this movie was so/so. There were about 3 really great 3D scenes, and the other 90% of the 3D was sub-par. (of course there are many who argue), but out of all the 3D movie's i have seen, this does not make it to the 'greatest' list.",1248739200,,788,4.143790849673203

Other than the cat, she really has no friends, and this doesn't really change throughout the story. It's a central element in the novel. So how do we handle this in Hollywood? We add an extraneous male character as a kind of ""friend"" for Coraline. This male character (Wybee short for ""Whyborn?"" which they got that right, as he has absolutely no purpose in the story) shows up at the beginning of the film, intermittently in the ""other"" world with button eyes, and finally swoops down on his RV just in time to save Coraline at the very end. In the book Coraline figures out how to wrap things up on her own.  Maybe this ending wasn't dramatic enough for the movies, but it was a hell of a lot more satisfying. So add sexist to pointless. We couldn't have a smart capable heroine solve her problems without male help, now could we?

The movie has a lot of good effects and spooky atmospherics which is why I gave it 2 stars, but the pointless vandalism committed on the book and the implications of those changes ruined the experience for me. Read the book...",1248739200,8,1216,4.448430493273543

The stop-motion animation is put to full use in this film and adds to quirky fantasy. There are some scary moments in this film that may be too much for small kids but overall this is a very child-centric movie.

Kinda disappointed in this Blu-Ray.  Well, in the 3D version on the Blu-Ray. Which is dreadful.  Saw it in the theater in 3D and it was incredible. The level of depth and realism imparted by the 3D was breathtaking. Between Coraline and Up, a case can finally be made for 3D being more than a gimmick (cough...Aliens and Monsters...cough) that ads nothing to the movie experience expect obvious 'thrills' (ooh! sharp pointy things coming at me! How novel!) But the 3D version on the blu-ray is unwatchable and I wish it hadn't been added as it is a waste of disc space (and even worse, an insult to the memory of a great movie experience).

While I know it's  not fair to expect the same level of depth and beauty on a TV version, I think it's more than fair to wish for more than what is present on the disc, which recalls the crappy 3D comics in the old Dynamite magazines of the 70s. The green/magenta lenses made the movie unwatchable and even more insulting, nothing ended up looking 3D.

Luckily the 2D version is incredible. But I wish that they hadn't even bothered with the attempt as it really mars the film experience (mars? try obliterates).

7771245,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I teach 5th grade, and one of the treats I have given my class over the years was to read a chapter from Coraline by Neil Gaiman.  My students will beg me to please read from Coraline, as I do the voices while I read the story.  This comes in handy when you want them to do their work, but you need a little motivation.  When I heard that it was to be made into a stop motion movie, I was ecstatic.  It was even more exciting to find that the people behind the classic Nightmare Before Christmas would be in charge of bringing this quirky little story to life.  The one apprehension I had was that I create my own voices for characters when I read aloud to my class, and after reading this book aloud for a few years, I had developed my own interpretations of how each character sounded. This is a great story to tell aloud, and it creates a lot of tension which leaves them hanging on begging for more.

So how does the movie compare to the book????  From the very beginning, a reader of the book will notice that there are some differences.  The movie is set in America, while the book is in England.  There is also a new character created for the movie.  You will not find Wybie anywhere in the book.  After watching the whole movie, I can understand why Wybie was placed in the movie.  Without him, Coraline spends a lot of time talking to herself.  While that may work fine in a book, it doesn't really translate well on film.  Therefore, I think that the inclusion of Wybie helps to carry the narrative along and it also provides a companion for Coraline.  The one thing that annoys me is the fact that the character of the Other Mother is nothing like I portrayed her when reading the story to my class.  This is not really a criticism, it's just that I had created my own version of her in my head, and it didn't correlate with the version in the film.  I'm not complaining about this, it was just a little bit of a distraction for me having read the book many times.  The rest of the characters and the story follow very closely to the book.  Of course the filmmakers had to add some scenes in order to flesh out the story so it could fill the time requirement as a feature film.  I don't think that any of the added material detracts from the story as a whole.  I have never seen a film adaptation of a book that was EXACTLY like the book.  Afterall, they are two different mediums, and each has its own requirements in what will work to tell the story.  This is a great adaptation, and I know that any fan of the book will not be dissatisfied by this movie.

Here are my thoughts on the 3-D version:
First of all, I would suggest that you read the notice about what settings on your TV will provide the best conditions for a good 3-D viewing experience.  It also works better to view this in a darkened room.  Since this has become a new trend in recent films, I have had the opportunity to see 3-D films both in the theater and at home.  Of course, current home theater technology does not lend itself to the pristine digital 3-D process by which this film was shown in theaters.  However, I will have to say that it is the best 3-D effects I have seen in a home setting.  Needless to say that the 3-D glasses do wash out a lot of the vibrant colors that are present in the 2-D version, but enough of the color is left to enjoy the beautiful artistry that went into the making of this film.  I would suggest that the viewer watch all of the credits, as there are several characters flying around in the background. If you watch all the way to the end of the credits there is a nice little 3-D effect at the very end.

Bottom Line:
This is a great interpretation of a wonderful book, and I would heartily recommend this to any viewer.",1248480000,6,3745,4.210378681626929
7771246,2,B01GWCB40Y,"...yet this is being touted for children all over the place. Let's face it, we live in a time where adults are so self-centered that a movie about a child wanting to seek escape from preoccupied, self-absorbed parents for a better, ideal version only to have that turn into a nightmare (so it's best to stick with the lousy parents one has, right?) is a pretty pathetic premise for a children's story.

But this is just one aspect.

Coraline is a strange kid. She's very angry, bitter, sarcastic, quick to act out and storm off and not all that likable. She's also strangely not a girl, but not quite a tom-boy. I don't know what she is. An ""adultified"" child with no real set gender. That's the best way to describe her.

But it gets worse. We have a whole host of sour, negative, non-life-affirming characters and two old ladies who were former burlesque dancers, if not strippers--and one with weird, enormous boobs of which there is one stage scene where it's borderline porn and I'm hardly a prude.

My question is: what does this have to do with a story that's supposedly for kids?

There's much violence and lots of scary imagery. Stuff I believe is just not right for the young. They have lots of time to enjoy the plethora of violence in our media. Why start so early?

What really disturbs me are the people that are putting this out and the film reviewers raving over this monstrosity.

This film should be a PG-13 at best. It reminds me of PAN'S LABYRINTH--which is actually better than this strange story about ideal parents turning into monsters and real parents who are self-absorbed and negative but, hey, they are better than the option! ""So be happy, Coraline, go away and let me get back to my lap top and cell phone."" seems to be the message.

This is the whole point of the movie, folks. And to think we once had  a world where the adults were concerned about children seeing the famous death scene of a doe's mother in BAMBI.

It's shuddering to see that not only is something like this marketed to children, but that the adults doing the promoting are oblivious to its strange, dark, and disturbing message.

Parents be warned.

7771247,3,B01GWCB40Y,"Please use caution if your child is under 12. My daughter is a mature 8 and I thought she would really enjoy this movie. She is not the dramatic type at all. So I was surprised when she said we had to shut it off or she would throw up. I thought maybe it was from watching it in the car with the 3d effects. But then she started crying. The crying lasted 2 hours. And then for several more at bedtime. She then wokeup with a nightmare about it.
I think it's a great movie for older children and adults. But if your children are young I suggest you watch the movie yourself first.
I do NOT think a PG rating was accurate whatsoever. PG13 would be better.
There is another part that you would find in animated porn that is not for children and was shocked to find a women was a huge exposed but bouncing up and down with a thong was in this movie.
The 3d also wasn't that impressive or even noticeable.",1248393600,5,900,4.090395480225989
7771248,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline (NOT Caroline) Jones (Fanning) is a very unhappy girl.  Both her parents are far too busy to pay much attention to her; she misses her friends back home; and the young boy who lives next door is a real pest.  The only solace she finds in her new apartment is a strange door that appears to be bricked up...until the sun goes down.  For that's when Caroline gets to go visit her Other Mother, a gracious woman who has all the time in the world for her beloved daughter.  There's just one little hitch: Coraline's Other Mother wants her to stay...forever.

""Coraline"" is from the mind of Neil Gaiman, so you know it's going to be twisted and disturbing.  And it is; this is one of the more frightening family films ever made.  The imagery is surprisingly horrific; perhaps smaller children won't pick up on the subtleties, but their parents certainly will.  The voice cast, featuring supporting roles by Terri Hatcher, John Hodgman, Keith David, and Ian McShane, helps create an atmosphere of spine-tingling suspense.  The real standout, though, is Dakota Fanning.  In previous film roles, she's been precocious and downright annoying; remember ""War of the Worlds""?  No?  Well, sorry for reminding you.  But here she's fantastic; she does what many voice-over artists fail to do: lend her animated character real life, real personality.

The overall effect of ""Coraline"" can be a bit numbing (I only gave the film 4 stars because, near the middle, it sags a bit, once the wonder has worn off).  Maybe it's different in 3D; I haven't jumped on that bandwagon yet.  (By the way, the DVD--and presumably Blu-ray--comes with both the 2D and 3D version of the film, so you can experience the movie both ways if you prefer.)  However, this is certainly a film you should watch if love a good old fashion Grimm's fairy tale.  That's what Gaiman and Selick have created: a modern-day fairy tale, complete with horrors and morals and a talking cat.",1248393600,5,1946,4.775449101796407

7771250,5,B01GWCB40Y,"I was looking forward to this as soon as it hit tehatres. Unfortunately my busy scehdule prevented me from getting to see it and oh how I regret it. Coraline, directed by Henry Selick (of Nightmare Before Christmas, and James and the Giant Peach fame)is an amazing journey of one lonely, misunderstood, and grossly ignored young lady, who find's everything she's ever wanted in ""Other World."" ""Other World"" is a mirror image of our own world that Coraline finds one night behind a wallpapered door, that had been bricked up when che discovered it earlier in the day. In this world there are ""Other"" versions of all the people she has just recently known, except with one difference, they are overly attentive to Coraline (even getting her name right, which no one , save for her parents can get right), and they all have black buttons for eyes. That is the first hint that something is very wrong with this place. But ""Other Mother"" is very convincing with her sweet personality, and amazing cooking abilities.
It isn't long that Coraline finds out exactly whats going on and the journey takes a rather dark turn, with dark parodies of the entertaining beings the ""others"" once were. Henry Selick is a stop motion GOD, and he trully excelled here. This film surpasses his past efforts, with a story based on the superbly talented Neil Gaiman, it's an instant classic.
HOWEVER this movie is NOT for little children. You know your kids best, but this movie has some really disturbing imagery, and the Button eyes are the least of it.
Finally the 3D version really pops. I personally have never been a fan of 3D as it utes the colors too much except for a few (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow), but wow do the colors that show glow.

The view through them is balanced. In other words, you do not feel you're going blind in one eye. I viewed this on a 48 inch Panasonic plasma monitor. The detail is beautiful and when the first button falls into the titles, I had a big smile. Rarely did I see double images. I was also very pleased as the tunnel stretched out behind the secret door. As you would expect, the beautiful color seen in the 2D version is lost while viewing the 3D version, but felt that CORALINE was much more colorful than previous 3D movies I've viewed at home.

My big disappointment came when I checked out the 3D version.  Rather than using the Real 3D technology as was in the theatre version, they used color-alternate anaglyphic 3D (like old school 3D movies).  The included glasses are the typical cardboard type.  It works well enough, but I was hoping for something a bit more advanced.  Also, rather than using the typical red/cyan anaglyphic, it's purple/green, so additional pairs of glasses will be a bit tougher to come by.

But if you're buying this DVD for the novelty of 3-D, I suggest you don't do it!  Although I should have known better, I was hoping that the producers had found a way to do 3-D with polarized channels for the Blu-Ray DVD. Unfortunately, they have not.

The 3-D is accomplished in 1950's style with blue and red channels viewed through blue and red lenses. This not only totally washes out the brilliant color from the 2-D version but actually makes you vaguely nauseous.  The 3-D effect is quite good and I'm sure that it was stunning in theaters but it is completely unwatchable on the DVD for more than a few minutes.

Buy the DVD for the movie if you wish, but don't buy it simply for the 3-D.  You'll be disappointed.",1248307200,3,926,4.482142857142857

  The story is not complex, but it's important to keep in mind that ""plot"" is not the point. This movie is all about experiencing the fantastic characters and their amazing/terrifying world. If you like ""Alice in Wonderland"" or the Harry Potter books, then you will probably enjoy Coraline. The stop-motion puppetry is first rate and the set pieces are breathtaking. Much of the movie is scored by a Hungarian children's choir, which goes a long way to creating a constant feeling of apprehension. The voice acting is superb.

Instead of the comfortable, plastic glasses (that fit over my glasses very comfortably), we get four, old school, blue and red (except now they are green and violet) headache-inducing cardboard cut-out glasses like studios used to use in the 1980's in theaters. The picture, instead of clear and stunning, is now flickering green and violet. It is very distracting. I couldn't watch it for more than a minute before I had to remove the glasses and return to the 2D version, which is also included in this DVD. I have no idea why the studio has made this switch (my guess is money issues), but it is very disappointing to go from a magical experience in the theaters to one that I will only share with my friends in 2D, as opposed to the incredible 3D that I have been raving and anticipating now for months. The film is still great. It is just a let down if you were expecting the same 3D effects as was shown on the big screen.

The Wybie character might have been introduced to meet the PC/diversity compulsion of modern cinema. Wybie is a distraction, then an irritant, and finally his role destroys a major part of Coraline's character development present in the book.

I saw this in 3-D in theaters, and just finished watching the 3-D version of the DVD on TV - on a 42"" LCD flat screen, which may account for part of why it looked so good.  I was very impressed by the 3-D look - this is the first time I've seen a home version 3-D that really worked.  Of course the theatrical 3-D version was the first one I'd seen that didn't feel like a gimmick.  There are moments of ""in your face"" shock designed to surprise and impress - but what's really impressive is  the immersive character of the world.  It feels like a lived-in fantastic world with depth and texture - quite exciting.  The music sets just the right mood.  The voices are perfectly meshed with the characters - and unlike many contemporary animated films don't call attention to themselves.  I never once thought ""that's Dakota Fanning"" or ""Terri Hatcher.""

While the colors seem slightly muted in the DVD's 3-D version, the depth is definitely there, and it looks nearly perfect if you watch it in the dark, as recommended.  This DVD set comes with 4 3D glasses, and includes both the 2D and 3D versions of the film, plus a digital version of the film and the standard ""making of"" and deleted scene features.

You have a two disc set that contains a 2D, 3D, DVD copy, Dig Copy, an hour of special features in 1080i, Dbox, and the usual mix of BD Live options from Universal.

I watched this with my kids both that are under 10, and contrary to what anyone says as a shock tactic, this movie was not a horror flick. It was a great animation film with a solid story that looked outstanding on Blu. Having both copies readily available, I compared several scenes to prove the vibrancy, colors, and clarity were greatly improved with BD, even with it being this type of animation. The 3D version loses the usual color palette, but looked great compared to other 3D out of late.

The DTS was mixed eloquently, and more times than not they managed to use all five channels with much more frequency that can be done with a live action film. So after enjoying a fun film (ignore the naysayers here) we spent an hour going over the supplements.

The making-of lasts 36 minutes and contains many smaller features that do have the Play All option. After watching the Voicing Of (10:46), the strangely edited deleted scenes (8:47) and the Creepy Coraline (5:30) segment I almost side with splitting between the features that you find the most interesting. The deleted scenes are bizarre in how they edited in the director's facial contortions and the ten 1-2 seconds blips as ""needing to be cut"" - whatever. Some great information either way regarding the time it took to make certain sequences. Have not had a chance to utilize the DBOX option or the BD live features for this one. The usual Universe U Control option is available to you if your player is all tuned up for doing the PiP and such.

The clarity, colors, sound, supplements, and extra copies all make for a worthwhile product purchase, especially for as low in price as it has gotten in the last week. Enjoy.",1247788800,2,1979,4.535014005602241

It revolves around a mom and dad and their daughter Coraline moving into a huge and sorta creepy looking victorian manor which is also occupied by other weird tenants.

Personally, I think younger kids would get frightenend after watching certain parts and there is this high wire act by these 2 old lady tenants that creeped ME out.

The plot is actually a tad on the confusing side, especially towards the end, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The fantastical elements were wonderfully executed and the grim, washed-out feel to the film really created the mood.

The gimmicky 3D visuals in Coraline were nice but if you take them away you are left with a mediocre film with a boring, cliche plot that is barely worth watching.

First i would like to say that is a little weird and out there but when people go as far as to say that every kid will be scared and have nightmares thats just plain sterotyping(get the pun its sterotyping and i am typing this ha ha ha!!!)Well as i was saying it is perfect! The mom is really so evil but is so good at being nice to coraline in the beggining and then she turns into a giant praying mantis( i never saw that coming but i saw it in the previews!!!) i defintly think that every one across the nation should have coraline in their homes!!!,1244937600,2,706,4.1231884057971016

7771312,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Question: What would you get if Alice Liddell married Jack Skellington?

Answer: CORALINE

The animated film, CORALINE is a deliciously eerie movie adaptation of the novel by Neil Gaiman.  This dark odyssey starts with a young girl's boredom and ends with her being appreciative of her own backyard. Both figuratively and literally. It is a well-told tale reminiscent of Through the Looking Glass, The Wizard of Oz, and Hansel and Gretel. What I particularly liked about the tale was that CORALINE's parents are alive and remain so from beginning to end. Yeah for living parents!

When first we see CORALINE (not Caroline, as she has to remind folks quite often) (voiced by Dakota Fanning), she is bored. She lives in an apartment with her mother and father, both of whom work from home but can't give her the attention she craves. She tries visiting the old Vaudevillian ladies who live upstairs as well as the crazy old man who trains the mice, but she just doesn't understand them. Huh. Then she finds the key and the door, and the passage beyond that's sometimes there and sometimes not. The old man says that the mice have a message for her: don't enter the passage. If only CORALINE had listened.

What CORALINE finds beyond that passageway is what makes this story interesting. It's what makes all classic fairytales interesting. Temptation, morality, determination, and heroism, all wrapped up like a spooky burrito with a side order of eerie dipping sauce.

CORALINE is a dark movie, full of black magic and creepy critters.  Brilliantly directed by Henry Selick (who brought us THE CORPSE BRIDE, JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH, and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) and Michael Cachuela, CORALINE is fast paced and contains just the right amount of spookiness.  My 12 year old LOVED this film, and my 4 year old liked it, too.  She did not have any bad dreams, and she completely understood that it was not real.  The animation is unique and very moody - perfect for this film.  The voice talent is all outstanding, but truly you are more interested in this weird and wonderful story than you are the voices.

CORALINE is a MUST SEE movie for 2009 and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by my entire family.  We had a great time watching it together.  CORALINE might not be typical family movie night fare, but it worked for us.",1244073600,3,2318,4.776942355889724
7771323,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline is the tale of a young girl who isn't entirely happy with her home life. But after slipping through a secret door into another world much like her own she can't wait to get home again. Unfortunately her ""other"" mother isn't about to let that happen without a fight. Why does this ""other"" mother want Coraline so badly? For company? For dinner???

The plot isn't at all thin - it's a very effective adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel, altered slightly for a more entertaining ride on the big screen. Henry Selick turns Neil Gaiman's fascinating novel into an incredible and creepy world full of odd characters. Neil Gaiman is this century's Hans Christian Andersen, creating new and fantastic ways to entertain children, and make parents want to revisit the shadowy world of fairy tales. My daughter has waited anxiously for the release of the dvd, but we may wait for a more elaborate release - want to make sure we get the 3D that made this one such a thrill in the theater!",1244073600,3,983,4.649425287356322
7771324,5,B01GWCB40Y,"If you are wondering if this is a good movie. Yes. The plot? Realistically speaking, it's a semi-childrens' movie. It may be too creepy for kids but it is derived from a kids book ( Neil G.) thus it is meant for younger audiences. Don't expect a brilliant plot like Godfather part 1 or Titanic, it's not meant to be a plot masterpiece. Just an entertaining film for everyone. Sit back and enjoy it. It's amazingly fun to watch and the music is great!",1243987200,2,450,4.369047619047619
7771325,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline (Henry Selick, 2009)

Henry Selick's greatest achievement until now is sadly neglected--the great The Nightmare Before Christmas. Why neglected, you ask? Because, thanks in large part to its stylistic tricks and the presence of Danny Elfman, ask ten fans of the movie who directed it, and you'll get nine people who say ""Tim Burton."" (Burton was actually the writer of the story upon which the movie is based, after a brilliant adaptation by Michael McDowell.) There can be little doubt that Burton had a profound influence on Selick, given his later work, but Selick has proven himself quite capable of standing on his own. Here, he partners up with another dark-fantasy great, Neil Gaiman, for an adaptation of one of Gaiman's finest novels, Coraline. And I have to say, this is the best film I saw on the big screen since El Laberinto del Fauno. Selick, who also wrote the screen adaptation, nails Gaiman's book in a way I wasn't sure could be done.

Plot: Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) and her family move to a spooky old boardinghouse in the middle of nowhere thanks to her mother (voice of Teri Hatcher)'s new writing assignment. While she does make a tentative new friend, the nerdy Wybie (voice of The Happening's Robert Bailey Jr.), she's roundly unsatisfied with her home life, and wishes she could find something better. That night, she discovers a tunnel into an alternate dimension, where she meets analogues of her mother and father (voice of Daily Show regular John Hodgman) who seem to have no interest other than pleasing her. The only other denizen of the house who can travel between the two worlds is a cat (voice of Keith David), who cautions Coraline that not all is as it seems. Coraline is willing to forego warnings for cake, but with the help of some of the house's more eccentric inhabitants, Coraline discovers that not all is, in fact, as it seems.

The house's other inhabitants are brought to life wonderfully, and with incredible talent (French and Saunders in fine form, Ian McShane), but it's Fanning and Bailey who steal the show here; they bring a magic to these characters that's rare even in live action. I tend to think of voicing animation as the opposite of silent film; rather than having no voice and having to get things across with exaggerated gesture, you have no gesture at all, and have to get things across with voice. Voice, however, is more subtle, and overdoing it can kill a movie (or a series, as anyone who's seen English-dubbed anime series can attest). Fanning has already proven herself an accomplished voice actress, but it's hard to believe this is Bailey's first outing. Good stuff, indeed. Hatcher is right at home playing a desperate housewife, of course, and French and Saunders just do what they do best, and it works. Heck, the whole cast have themselves a great time here, and it shows. It's all backed up with Selick's trademark creepy animation, that works just as well here as it did in The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. (It may be heresy, but I'll note it, at least in passing; the film is currently rated a tenth of a point higher at IMDB than is The Nightmare Before Christmas. Shocking!) As a side note, making Teri Hatcher's character look like, well, Teri Hatcher will be an extra kick for Desperate Housewives fans.

In the afterword to the novel, Gaiman notes that while adults are likely to read it as a horror novel, children see it more as an adventure, and tend not to be scared by it. This is one aspect of the book that Selick didn't translate, and my thirteen-year-old daughter (who is rapidly becoming a connoisseur of bad horror films, just like her dad) was extremely creeped out by a few scenes towards the climax of the film. You may want to shoo the younger kiddies out of the room before watching this, but no matter. The adults will be just as charmed by it as the older kids will be. Maybe even more so. ****",1243814400,2,3944,4.686868686868687
7771326,5,B01GWCB40Y,In my opinion this is one of the best movies for (older) kids I have seen in a very long time. A welcome break from all the movies with a super nice and/or super intelligent dog that you usually get to see here in the USA.....,1243814400,2,226,3.9347826086956523
7771327,4,B01GWCB40Y,"Coraline, the latest adaptation of a work by Neil Gaiman, has hit theatres. It tells the story of young girl who, along with her rather oblivious parents, has just recently moved to the Pink Palace Apartments in what appears to be Ashland, Oregon. She feels stifled and doesn't like the place, especially after she meets weird local boy Wybie.

Her life becomes rather more interesting when she finds a portal to another world (climbing through something rather similar to a big, blue-purple vagina. I'm not judging, just reporting), where she meets her Other Mother and Other Father, both idealized versions of her parents with buttons for eyes. They lavish love and attention upon her and don't appear to want anything in return. Well, possibly her eyes.

This is a weird little stop-motion animated movie with some of the best, most amazing visuals I've seen on film in a long time. One of the things I love about movies is their abilities to show me things I've never seen and on that level this film doesn't disappoint. The mouse circus alone is worth the price of admission. It's also got a good, if rather basic, plot and some great voice acting.

The film has a brisk pace, and at no point was I looking at my watch, wondering when it would end. The sheer creativeness of what I was seeing up on the screen was enough to distract me from the few plot holes, though I did notice a couple points where it seemed like scenes were missing.

But there was something kind of off about the film. I don't know what it was. It certainly felt somewhat incomplete, and the third act felt kind of rushed (basically, ""Go off on a quest!"" followed a few moments later by, ""Right, quest done!""). Despite that, it was a decent movie and I didn't feel my money was wasted, which is always a plus.

One word of caution about the film. I would be careful on taking young kids to see it. There's some rather dark images here (like a few attempts at removing eyes), that might give kids some rather unhappy dreams. I'd not take anyone under about 8 or so without seeing it first to screen it.

Also, I can't speak to the 3-D effects, since my theatre didn't show it in 3-D. I could tell where there were clearly moments that were supposed to be 3-D but weren't. I've a feeling it probably didn't add anything to the movie to see it in 3-D, though.

So if you want a good time at a film where you'll see things you've never seen before, go to this. If you don't want that, hey, there's always Benjamin Button. At least you'll keep in the buttons theme.",1243728000,2,2538,4.456896551724138
7771328,5,B01GWCB40Y,"The old timely tales such as Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and even Nancy Drew were enough to inspire, teach and terrify girls have been considered old school or even as much as dead for a long time now.  Their morals have been lost and their messages decayed overtime in the wake of inferior media directed as girls--such as the Twilight Series and Hanna Montana.  Let's face it. Today there is hardly a good franchise directed at preteen girls that strikes a positive message and doesn't encourage what's become a popular trend in today's consumer standards: the spending of mommy and daddy's hard-earned cash for either blind happiness or settling with a hot abusive boyfriend.  *eye-roll*

Coraline, projected from the creative efforts of Neil Gaiman and Henry Selick, may actually be the film that parents, mentors etc. have been waiting for after Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was brutally murdered and when Harry Potter came to a close.  While a twisted and almost a sickly creepy flick of dark proportions to some, behind its beautifully stop-motion-crafted walls, is story of maturity, responsibility and friendship.

The movie starts with Coraline (Dakota Fanning), an apathetic, whiny, complaining girl moving into her new home with her parents, hardly enthusiastic about her new living space.  The neighbors are either crazy or senile and the only person in the area within her age-range (Wybie--Robert Bailey Jr.) seems to have a miss-match when it comes to forming chemistry between the two of them.  Her parent's duty to their line-of-work doesn't help her adjustments, and the rain outside limits her activities.  That all changes with a mysterious doll given to her by Wybie that apparently leads her to unlocking a mysterious door in her new home.

In front of her parents, there's nothing but a brick-wall behind it, but at night it becomes a gateway to a parallel universe.  There, she meets her ""other"" mother (Terri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) who-- unlike their originals--are outgoing, affectionate and seemingly determined to dote upon their little girl.  Everything about the world is brighter, better and more vibrant than the one Coraline presently inhabits--which leads her to coming back night after night, despite the countless warnings from her neighbors and even the efforts of her mother and father as they attempt to form connections with their estranged daughter.  With each visit, the world expands and something that was either banal or tedious before in the real world, appears lushly more beautiful and elaborate in the alternate one.  Everything about the world is superior--the food, the clothes, the toys, even her neighbors and Wybie are seemingly better and improved...

...but Coraline soon learns that this imperfection is false, when the true nature of the world and her other mother's intentions are revealed.  Her real mother and father are captured and suddenly, the world turns from bright, happy and lenient to dark, cruel and unrelenting.  Aided by a cynical black cat, as well as receiving assistance from a few other ""hopeless"" allies (products of both the real and alternate worlds) she attempts to rescue her parents and put a stop to the other mother's plans.

The film itself is beautifully sculpted and animated, showing vast improvements in stop-motion animation quality since The Nightmare Before Christmas. But don't think that this movie is superior to Tim Burton's masterpiece (that movie was a classic, people... nothing will ever beat it) because if you think like that going into the film, when the credits roll you will most likely be disappointed.  My advice is try to see it as its own respected film and then you can't go wrong.

Bonus features on this product (compliments of Blu-RayDOTcom) are as follows:

In any case, this movie almost revives the dramatic yet engrossing effects that the Grimm fairy tales did two centuries ago--with a modern and more artistic glow to the common themes of growing up and facing one's fears.  With that it mind, it is highly recommended that your viewers are at least above the age of nine (as this may send anyone younger screaming and fleeing from your living room to the safety of the spot under their covers in their rooms) or are at least mature enough to handle a little bit of built-up tension--because there are times when this could send the socks flying off a college student. (I am totally not kidding)  Other than that, this movie is a must for your HD collection--as both a beautiful piece of ""art"" and an enchanting story that will charm the minds of girls (and boys) for at least another decade.",1243468800,2,5091,5.0
7771329,5,B01GWCB40Y,"Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.

Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of ""Coraline,"" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous ""other"" world.

Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.

It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed ""other mother"" (Teri Hatcher) and matching ""other father,"" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.

At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.

Neil Gaiman's book ""Coraline"" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.

Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.

The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.

Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.

The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.

Apparently the blu-ray (as usual now) will have some material not included on the standard DVDs. There's going to be a trio of featurettes about making and voicing the movie, deleted scenes, a digital copy, and a movie commentary -- and exclusive to the blu-ray is ANOTHER featurette, ""picture in picture,"" BD-live, and something called ""My Scenes Sharing.""

""Coraline"" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures. Definitely a must-see, for those who enjoy a movie with some genuine chills.",1242950400,3,3967,5.013677811550152
