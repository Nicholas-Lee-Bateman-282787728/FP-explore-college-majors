8504376,5,B006U3FU2O,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like ROH, DragonGate, and NWA.

The main event for this card was for the P.W.G. Championship as the feud between Kevin Steen & El Generico continued only this time being a ladder match which turned out to be one of the most violent ladder matches I've personally ever seen just based off the various highlights & moments such as backdrops onto the ladder in & outside the ring including one that actually bent the ladder in half, a CodeBreaker with the ladder in-between the knees & face, a bodyslam onto the open ladder, full nelson back suplex onto ladder head first, and powerbombs off the ladder onto another ladder scaffold between the ropes. The P.W.G. Tag Team Championship was also on the line as Young Bucks defend against the team of Future Shock make their debuts in a different type of match than we usually get from the Bucks as they toned down their usual showing off & playing to the crowd to deliver a more physical competitive wrestling match. Other matches include a six person tag match with 4 men making their PWG debuts in Famous B & Chris Kadillak & the female Candice LeRae vs. Peter Avalon & Ray Rosas & Freddy Bravo, Rocky Romero vs. T.J. Perkins, RockNES Monsters vs. Fightin' Taylor Boys that featured so much flying out of the ring into the audience & one moment where a double team launched ""Canadian Destroyer"" piledriver happened that looked like it killed the recipient, Willie Mack vs. Davey Richards in a match that was so hard fought that the bottom rope broke, Los Luchas vs. Dynasty in a ""lucha libre rules"" match featuring a bunch of high flying, and Ricochet vs. Chuck Taylor that had some comedic moments in the beginning in regards to both men trying to grab the hanging World Title.

In the end, the main event was amazing to say the last as they ""tore the roof off"" literally & the extra bonus of a long awaited return. On top of that, you have a mixture of everything as we had great diverse styles of wrestling throughout the night along with some entertainment moments from time to time. The crowd chanted ""show of the year"" once this event was over & they have a valid point as I have nothing to say bad about this show & was one of the best events I've been to in the year I've been attending P.W.G. shows.",1333756800,3,2509,4.585746102449889
