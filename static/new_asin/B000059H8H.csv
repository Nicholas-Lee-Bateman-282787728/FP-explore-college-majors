1404507,5,B000059H8H,"...If you want the good old fashioned solid, helmet, breastplate, horns Wagner, this is not the DVD to buy.
The picture quality of this anamorphically enhanced for 16x9 tv's dvd is very good. It has some minor motion artifacts, I assume this is due to a PAL NTSC (50Hz -> 60Hz ) conversion, and the fact that deinterlacing video sources is just extremely hard. It would have been nice to not have these, but why complain: this is by far the best looking opera DVD to date! I watched this on a 64"" HDTV (Pioneer 710HD) with a progressive scan DVD player (Toshiba SD-9200) and it just blew me away.
The sound is very good too. It's 5.1 Dolby digital, but seems to mastered from a dolby surround matrix encoded sound track. It has good spacial envelopment and sounds very good, for DVD standards, though not as good as a CD (example Bernstein's Tristan with Hildegard Behrens)
Performance: Waltraut Meyer is (as expected) FENOMINAL! enough said. Kurt Moll SAME!, Mehta's orchestration is also beautifully done. The rest of the cast is defintely good to great, so we don't have any weaknesses there.
As far as the 'optimistic' end. I don't see the problem here. One reviewer thought both Tristan & Isolde are still alive.... Excuse me?????? It is OBVIOUS, they are both DEAD. I have always interpreted Isolde's singing about Tristan waking up, as an indication she is dying herself. Her 'mild und leise' just brings shivers down my spine.
Buy this set. Darken the room. Crank up the volume and enjoy.",996710400,12,1496,4.713740458015267
1404508,1,B000059H8H,"When I saw this DVD in my local DVD store, I was so excited to finally have a performance of Tristan und Isolde on DVD. I knew one of the solists from previous recordings, Kurt Moll.
When the overture was over, I was surprised, to say the least, to see a luxary liner instead of Tristan's boat. Hearing Waltraud Meier as Isolde was a pleasure, but that is where the pleasure ended. To see Isolde and Brangaene act in that set and wearing these horribly ugly dresses. The Brangaene of Marjana Lipovsek was ok, though. Ok was also Bernd Weikl as Kurwenal. But when I heard Jon Fredic West, I was REALLY put off. He is proberbly the worst tenor I have heard. The few notes he sang with reasonable clarity had words in them that sounded like he didn't believe them. As for rest of the notes, he shouted and barked them out with even more unconvincing delivery of the words. While watching this, I longed for the beauty and undstanding of Melchior and Vickers.
It wasn't until the end of Act 2 that one really good artist walked in on the stage. Kurt Moll, one of best basses of the last 20 years. His reading as Marke was so heartfelt, powerful and understanding, that I was really moved with him. Considering West, it was like I wished Marke to have Isolde instead of the horrible Tristan. The setting of Act 2, was in a garden full of pastel colors. But the settings in the first two acts were beautiful compared to the horribly horrible setting of Act 3. The action took place in an apartment with a window, and in the background were slides, that had nothing at to do with the story, shown. I wished that the third act would be over and so the performance. And mirroring the sets, West was equally bad. His barking and shouting continued.
One can ask why I bothered to see through the whole thing if it was so bad. The only answer I can give is that I wanted to see Meier sing Isolde's Liebestod in addition to listening to the gloriously sung Marke again. And when Meier started to sing her Liebestod finale, West was seen in front of her standing and smiling to her, and at the end they closed the curtain and then the curtain opened again showing two coffins. That ending also really put me off.
The conducting of Zubin Mehta was staightforward and quite good. The sound was good and the picture quality was also excellent, being 16x9 enhanced.
This Tristan und Isolde performance's only redeeming quality was Kurt Moll. Although Waltraud Meier was also quite good, I longed for the beauty and power of Kirsten Flagstad, Nanny Larsen-Todsen and Birgit Nilsson.",994032000,22,2563,4.490364025695931
1404509,2,B000059H8H,"There is so much to hate about this insipid production that it is easy to miss what's good about it.  Namely, Waltraud Meier.  But this great singing actress's fascinating voice and spectacular cheekbones are completely lost in the nonsense of this production.  This is an anti-production, which means that just about any concept you can imagine on the stage would be better than this.

The first act opens on the deck of a wacky post-postmodern yacht complete with lounge chairs and cocktails (in frosted glasses with straws -- these will later be used to foist the love potion upon us).  Think Miro's drunken nightmare of sad-clown velvet paintings.  Isolde's costume couldn't be more distracting. It is supposed to be a wedding dress.  This shabby schmatta hangs like a thrift shop special, unaccountably decorated with what appear to be hot-pink felt hearts glued haphazardly to dirty sleeves.  But even all this is overcome by Meier's miraculously ferocious singing.  As Tristan, on the other hand, West can't sing to save his soul.  He plays the knight as a big blustery fratboy as he barks out the music, so strained in some places that one fears for his heart.  Until he drinks the potion, he seems to believe that he's about to get lucky.  To make matters worse, half his face is covered with shaving cream for most of the act (we are supposed to imagine that Isolde has inconsiderately interrupted his toilette).

The second act begins with more promise, on a big purple and green set with Isolde much more handsomely dressed.  A big yellow sofa splotched with more pink hearts noisily appears, however, only to be thrown upside down by the now seriously stressed tenor.  It's hard to describe how bad he is. Moreover, when the two start to get busy, climbing all over the couch, he takes off her gown to reveal the absurd 1st act wedding dress again!

The third act sports what the cover calls an ""optimistic"" ending (!?!?!?!).  Meier's passionate Liebestod is marred by a still living Tristan stupidly grinning as she sings it.  The last tableau, after they have wandered blissfully off the stage, of two white coffins, comes off as a senseless nod to the meaning of the text.

Marjana Lipovska, as Brangaene, is good actress, but her voice is strained.  Kurt Moll's King Mark is stolid and predictable.  Weikl is way beyond his prime, and his Kurvenal falls apart shortly after he opens his mouth in the first act.

The good news is, we probably won't have to endure long in a world where this is the only DVD of Tristan.  The Met's great recent production with Ben Heppner and Jane Eglan has become available on DVD.  Hallelujah.",987638400,78,2643,4.770925110132159
1404550,2,B000059H8H,"Music is superb.

I think it is even better than my CD favorite conducted and recorded by Carlos Kleiber.

The sound is beautiful here because of superior DVD audio format.

Why then, only two stars given?

It's camera work;

It's simply the worst ever seen.

The post modern, avant-garde, or whatever you call, this new stage design is not that bad.

But it is so sad to see that everything was lost because of horrendously poor camera work.

You will be watching cruelly revealing close-up shots of badly made-up face of Isolde all through the opera.

It only makes you sad because her singing is so marvelous; you have to close your eyes to appreciate it.

Then why do you have to watch the DVD?",1124150400,7,698,4.512
1404551,5,B000059H8H,"My first reaction to viewing this remains the same: ""Wow!""

Some will immediately be put off by Peter Konwitschny's production, but if you give it a chance, it works as complete musical theatre. (A few touches could've been left out, e.g., Tristan's face half covered in shaving cream for most of Act I.)

Act I finds Isolde and Brangane on the deck of a faux post-modernish luxury liner, Isolde distraught in a wedding gown and veil, Brangane reclining on a yellow and white chaise lounge sipping cocktails from frosted glass with a crazy straw. Somehow, it all makes sense.

Waltraud Meier is an Isolde of such intensity that I doubt the role has ever been more completely ""felt"" by any singer. We know this singer has some strain at the top of her voice yet, here, it serves to match the expressivity and intensity of her face and action. Thus, we are treated to an Isolde of such sensuality and grief, one who's entire body registers every note of rage, despair, revenge and longing. When

One of my favorite few seconds in all of opera is the closing of Act I from the moment Kurwenal belts out ""Heil, Tristan"" and the sailors are ""heil""ing all over the place. Bernd Weikl's Kurwenal makes this moment one of the most magical musical highlights of this production. As Tristan and Isolde are separated, Tristan marches on to meet his King, as Brangane pushes her Mistress on, Meier's arm raises to shield her eyes from the vision of her new life. Musically and visually this is tremendous.

Jon Frederic West has some tough moments as Tristan, more often than not we find him barking and at times he looks and sounds like he's going to explode. Nonetheless, he gets most of the notes and at times, especially in the Act II Liebesnacht can sound lovely.

Act II is staged in a modernist rendition of a forest to which Tristan drags a bright yellow, flowered sofa(!) where most of the Liebesnacht is sung, each lover holding a burning candle in the palm of their hand. Some of the most beautifully sung music occurs here as Brangane sings her watch/warning. Marjana Lipovsek, who sounded a little strained in Act I, here is mindboggingly radiant as she pulls votive candles from her robe, lighting one from another and setting them about the stage. At the climax of the duet, Konwitschny has every stage light and house light come on in less time than it takes to blink and we realize the stage is filled with Marke's soldiers and the scheming Melot. It is an audible gasp inducing moment of theatre.

As Marke, Kurt Moll's famous resonant bass is breathtakingly secure, still firm and the man knows how to command a stage like few others. That voice is a miracle of sound combining power and beauty.

Act III is magnificently staged and acted, once you get past the dirty room, with a dirty white radiator, and large dirty French windows. We find Tristan slumped in an arm chair - everyone's entrances are made through a back door. Brangane appears at the window, but the loyal Kurwenal bars her entrance by locking the windows as soldiers come in and at the height of the musical frenzy Brangane violently smashes the windows and climbs into the room. Tristan and Isolde have fled the stage down the ever present central steps leading to a level below a false proscenium. Here they remain each on opposite sides of the stage as they slowly, despite the imploring of Marke and Brangane, pull the stage curtain closed, closing themselves off from the rest of the world. In front of the curtain, Meier begins perhaps the slowest Liebestode, maintaining the line impressively and builds it into an ecstatic, transcendent experience that mere words cannot begin to do justice to. The camera remains fixed on that glowing, expressive face and I felt as though Isolde was singing to me alone. At its conclusion Tristan and she smile and embrace as she slowly leads him into the darkness, his face beaming with love at her. As they disappear the curtain slowly opens and the opera's final image is of King Marke and Brangane standing beside two white tombs surrounded by white flowers; breathtaking causing my tear ducts to let loose. It is perhaps the most satisfying and strikingly beautiful ending I've seen to this great opera.

After the final curtain and the final notes have faded it is a full 10 seconds of complete silence before the house erupts into a frenzy.

Zuben Mehta conducts the Munich forces with control and restrained passion and the orchestra responds with playing of ravishing beauty. In particular the Act III prelude which is so gorgeously played I had to repeat it before continuing with the act.

Even the curtain calls here are thrilling, and after the final solo bow, for Meier, the curtain opens to reveal the orchestra who have magically appeared on the stage, as Mehta leads the entire orchestra en masse down to the footlights to the wild cheering of the crowd. It too is a magnificent moment.

This DVD probably is not for everyone but if you're one of those who can get past some of the small bizarre touches (admittedly, several of my friends could not), this Tristan will prove to be a profoundly moving experience.

1404552,4,B000059H8H,"After the prelude (beautifully conducted by Zubin Mehta) the drama begins on a ship of no known vintage, earthly design or even any concept of anything that might float. The young seaman looks as if he stole his uniform from Little Lord Fauntleroy. The ravishing Waltraud Meier is first seen wearing a dress that belongs in ""Bride of Bozo"". Tristan shaves incessantly.
This is just the beginning of the optical assault.
The second act features a ""torch"" that looks like a dandelion after an overdose of steroids. The great love duet from Act II is played out on an ugly yellow couch that looks as if someone painted it. Act III begins with a slideshow that's supposed to be symbolic but feels meaningless. The only good thing is that it gives Tristan something to do besides shave.
That's not to say this production should be avoided-it shouldn't be. The onslaught of visual weirdness aside, it's well acted, well played, well sung and the sound quality is good. As a conductor Mehta works for balance and feeling, something which serves the enormity and passion inherent in Wagner's works well. His orchestra is never too heavy or light in any area. His tempo is graceful but never too fast or slow. The cast is solid. Bernd Weikl and Marjana Lipovsek are solid in their roles as friends and confidantes to the cursed lovers. Kurt Moll brings warmth and compassion to each scene he's part of and Claes Ahnsj is convincingly despicable as Melot. John Frederic West is an excellent actor and a decent singer. His voice isn't always quite strong enough for the role of Tristan. In the music's highest ranges his strain shows but he more than compensates with the intelligence he gives to the role and through the chemistry he shares with the production's Isolde, Waltraud Meier. The truth is that when these two play out their great love scene there's enough sparks between them for me to forget about the ugly couch.
Waltraud Meier is an Isolde to marvel at! Her performance alone should make this DVD a ""must have"".
As an actress she's fabulous. She doesn't waste movements or gestures but instead conveys meaning with each and every one. She's among the most acclaimed mezzo-sopranos of her generation and this performance shows why. Her range is phenomenal-there's not an instant where her voice shows a sign of strain (incredible given the demands of the music for Isolde). As all the great ones can she colors her voice with an infinite number of subtle and powerful shadings which give greater emotional depth to any area her voice touches. This may be what sets her so far beyond the rest. When the drama closes with Isolde's Liebestod she still sounds fresh, vibrant and alive. The Liebestod is one of those pieces of music good enough to warrant fame for its composer even if he or she hadn't written anything else of value. There are a lot of recordings of it but never enough good ones.
This isn't just one of the good ones-it's one of the great ones.",1080604800,19,2961,4.718146718146718
1404553,4,B000059H8H,"Very exciting production in the musical thing. Good interpreters and a not genial master but expert and knowledgeable of the secrets of the musical theatre, conductor Zubin Mehta.
The production of the Opera of Munich is slightly shrill in the use of hot colors that counter laughs the moments by night like it is the Act II, and slightly nobly in the freedoms with the libretto (waiter with drinks instead of the sailor of the beginning Act I and ambulant sofa forthwith the Act II). Nevertheless, it does not betray the fundamental thing and the solution of the end is adapted to the character of the music and text.
They are the interpreters those who motivate passions. The Isolda de Waltraud Meier is simply perfect. When the King Marke goes to her indicating her "" nobility and sublime grace ... "" she wears shoes wonderfully with his ""look"". Initially her voice is not heard well, but seemingly it is a problem of microphones because her voice and singing refulgen in the party with her woman's transfiguration hurt to immaterial lover. The Jon Fredric West's Tristan is seemingly very young, an almost a teenager, though he is taller than his Isolda, with what he does not stay in scenic disadvantage. He solves with valor all his singing, and seems to be miraculous that works out alive of the great monologue of the act III. An ovation is gained well-deservedly. The performance of the lovers is good and captivating. The King Marke de Kurt Moll is surprising because this veteran sings to any voice with pain and bonhomie as his personage. The Kurwenal and Brangaene make the work with rigor and good singing, nevertheless it is disappointing in case of Weikl, with his cach and experience (he intervened in the recordings of Karajan and Bernstein), his little strengthen in the scenic and facial performance.
Brian Large's direction is like always, commits an outrage against the details developers and the first planes, without forgetting the global spectacle. The sound, marvellous.",1071360000,8,1996,4.925816023738872

In regard to this production...BUY a CD instead....The whole scenic concept of Tristan is destroyed like an atomic bomb was dropped on it....To be very kind....For those of us, who have over the years, seen the romantic productions...This one is a waste of money and time....The works were written to fit within a time epoch...The music, Libretto, and the presentation were outlined by the composers as to production values as well as musical values ( especially this composer ), The set designer must be one of the young brats that wouldn't know romanticism if he were clobbered over the head with it...There's more to Opera than just singing and orchestra music... Here's good advice......Steer Clear of This Production if Eye Candy is as important to you as well sung portrayals of characters and good orchestral presentation....",1049587200,21,961,5.050314465408805
1404555,4,B000059H8H,"Nothing offensive in this production,at most some
odd costumes,even to the most puristic wagnerian.
The candles idea on actII is very elegant instead of
to watch the performers at the floor,beneath a tree for
so much time. Slides on act III fit well on methaphysical
aspects of the Tristan's death. Due I'm a professional
musician,some West's inaccurate tunning troubles me.
Furthermore he is a feeble actor and insecure in ""O
sink hernieder"" but,above all problems,this is a very
high performance by Mehta and his orchestra,an astonishing
Isolde by Meier,even better that one under Barenboim.
Her ""Liebestod""(only she on stage,close curtains back)
comes completely intense,transcendental and audience in
Munich gives an outstanding ovation to her. I think
Lipvosek' harsh voice suitable to shrew parts like Fricka
and the nursemaid in ""Frau ohne Schatten"" but I didn't
like her Brangaene here and with Barenboim in spite of
she is a fine actress. Moll sings Marke emotionaly;he
understand this complex character(just forget a lot of
foolishness relating his age).A jubilant Melot by Claes
Ahnsjo and maybe,some apathy over Weikl. Nearly impossible
is perfection in a live Wagner,nevertheless this team
was so near.",1045094400,7,1215,5.4338624338624335
1404556,5,B000059H8H,"OK, you don't have to have a plasma TV to enjoy this DVD. But if you do have one, or are considering buying one, this is probably the first DVD you should buy, at least if you like Wagner. Or, if you don't know Wagner yet, this DVD may well convert you. I splurged on a plasma TV mostly to get more out of my music DVD collection, only to find out that all but three of my 45-some opera DVDs are in conventional 4:3 picture format. Either you have to watch them with those unsightly bars on both sides to get the correct proportions, or distort the side areas of the picture to make it fit the wide screen.

 What a delight to watch a widescreen opera DVD specially enhanced for 16:9 TVs! Any small gripes some might have about unconventional staging or orange sofas, or whatever, will dissolve instantly in the panoply of color and facial expression that unfolds before your eyes. While at the end of each act the camera moves back to reveal (to our surprise, the first time) that we are actually in an opera house, through most of the video we see only a close-up of the stage-set and the performers.
In fact, for much of the opera the faces of the singers fill most of the screen, so that you could count the hairs in Jon Fredric West's beard or even the fillings in his teeth if you felt so inclined. These facial close-ups allow us to participate in the emotional experience of the characters to a degree that is difficult in a live performance -- even with opera glasses or binoculars. This in turn helps draw us deeper into the etherial beauty and unrelenting intensity of Wagner's music, which weaves richly around and through the arioso vocal lines of the performers.
West's tenor performance throughout is absolutely superb, especially in the scenes in Act III where, wounded and distraught, he anxiously awaits Isolde's return. Meier's performance as Isolde is also unforgettable, and the rest of the cast is of equally high calibre. The music -- some of the most hauntingly beautiful ever written -- is performed by the Bayerische Staatsorchester, masterfully conducted by Zubin Mehta. Mehta is also the conductor of another of the relatively few widescreen opera DVDs on the market -- Puccini's Turandot.
As widescreen TVs grow more and more popular, I hope that it won't be long before the technology of opera DVDs catches up with that of movie DVDs. There is so much more potential in the new audio-visual technologies than is being tapped by the current stream of re-releases of old opera videotapes in DVD format, as precious as many of these old performances are.
An example of the new ""21st century"" style of opera DVD is the recording of Handel's ""Tamerlano"" performed in 2001 at the 50th Handel-Festspiele in Halle on the Saale, released in a beautifully packaged 2-DVD set by ArtHaus in August, 2002. In addition to the 192 minute opera (with subtitles in 4 languages), the set includes the film ""The Making of Tamerlano"" with four language options, score plus, interviews, an interactive chronology, and historical film footage from previous Handel festivals. The DVD is in 16:9 format and offers 5.1 surround sound as well as PCM. Unfortunately, this state-of-the-art set is not presently available  (as of January 2003).",1041292800,11,3245,4.739823008849558
1404557,5,B000059H8H,"I have to say this is the first production of T&I I saw. The first act dissapointed me very much. I wasn't very happy with the cast either, espesially Jon West. This all faded away as soon as I saw act II, which moved me to tears: The yellow sofa, as if they were sitting in front of the tv. Waltraud's white dress with the red balls, I actually liked it in the second act. Jon West turned out to be a very sympathetic Tristan. And the candles scene took my breath away. I think the black clothing. revealed at the end of the act, and also the T&I stepping of the stage when K. Marke enters the scene are an incredible invention. At the end of Act III they do something similar. I had never percieved the true greatness of Waltraud Meier in the Daniel Barenboim recording, but now it came through laud and clear. She is, to me, the greatest Isolde ever. Better than Birgit Nilsson for Bohm or Martha Modl for Karajan.

7933181,5,B000059H8H,"I purchased this Tristan almost 2 years ago. For one reason or another it sat on my shelf and I didn't go near it. Love Waltraud Meier, but thought it was a 'boring' production from its crappy cover (stupid assumption, i know). I started watching it and was sucked in like few dvd's have the power to do- Watching this was like the first time I saw Tristan in a house (Met Opera 1998 with Eaglen / Heppner)- at the end of the love duet my heart was racing and it felt like too was stopped in the middle of 'the act' like T&I...

While this production seems to be 'regie', with the opening being on a modern cruise ship, its really a traditional production with a few broken 4th wall moments and a final scene that breaks your heart.

Waltraud Meier continues to infuriate me in that she is so rarely at the MET and gives Europe this incredible performances. She is stunning vocally in this, but stunning to look at as well- her red hair conjures a willful Irish princess. Jon Frederic West is an OK Tristan, but seriously, watching the 3rd act monologue, how can anyone be anything but 'ok'- Isolde gets the final curtain but Tristan works it!

I buy a lot of opera dvd's and seem to watch only sections (favorite moments, etc)- The highest praise that I can give this is I sat transfixed through all 3 acts and will watch it again soon",1343088000,,1336,4.336

Zubin Mehta conducts the orchestra in this most famous overture and the camera angles and timings are superb. They get the overture exactly right and from there on in the rest of the opera is quite compelling even if it is 'different' from other interpretations of Tristan und Isolde.",1332547200,,548,5.032967032967033

Modern designers and directors only want to stroke their own egos by destroying the artistic achievements of others.  Apparently incapable of understanding the concept of legend or myth, they reduce everything to the tawdry modernism, but they cannot even do this as well as true artists and thinkers such as Samuel Beckett have done it.  The real shame here is that these stupid settings and costumes obscure really fine singing and orchestral playing and conducting.  Closing your eyes helps, but then why buy the DVD?

7933184,5,B000059H8H,"Many thanks to J. F. Laurson for his/her review (above).  How wonderful to read an accurate, honest review of this DVD!  I, too, saw the production in the theatre in Munich in 2001 (were we at the same performance?) and found it to be one of the most overwhelming experiences I have had in (at that point) 31 years of international opera-going.

""Regietheater"" (director's theatre) is, indeed, not for everyone.  A major problem is that Americans seem to only hear about the really outrageous productions, such as the Berlin production of Mozart's ""Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail"" directed by provocateur Calixto Bieito which features a lot of full frontal nudity, real whores allegedly hired from the streets of Berlin, and simulated sex and mutilation.  But when there is a magnificent retelling of an old tale - Peter Konwitschny's ""Don Carlos"" at the Vienna State Opera, Michael Sturminger's ""La clemenza di Tito at the Graz Opera, Sergio Morabito's and Jossi Wieler's ""Norma"" at Stuttgart Opera to name only a small handful - it's only the die-hard fans who hear about it.  (Also, in German and Austrian opera houses, productions are often only used for one or two seasons, unlike the Met which maintains productions dating back to the 1960s in active repertory.)

Mozart's ""La clemenza di Tito"" languished for almost 200 years, written off as Boring Boring Boring, and when New York's hallowed Met finally premiered the opera in 1984 (it was written in 1791), it did so with huge cuts in the recitatives, and ugly designs trying to look like ancient Rome in decay (see it yourself: the production is still being used as of the 2007/2008 season).  Sturminger's production distilled it to its essence: a story of sex, political power, and jealousy, and with no cuts to the recitatives, he made it compelling, exciting, edge-of-your-seat theatre.  The story is insanely complex, and I have never seen it made more clear: when the emperor Tito (Titus) refuses to believe that his friend Sesto led a plot to assassinate him, instead of another character standing there and telling him of Sesto's betrayal, he shows him a black-and-white surveillance videotape which proves without a doubt that Sesto was the ringleader.  How clear can you get?  Would you understand it better if it were two guys in powdered wigs and long robes standing and yakking at each other in Italian?

""Regietheater"" has the power to make opera relevant for today's audiences, and take arcane stories (how many of us can really relate to, say, Norma's situation, or fully comprehend the epic political ramifications of Scarpia's murder in ""Tosca""?) and make us relate to them (such as the way we understand Tristan's state of mind in the brilliant third act of the DVD which is the subject of this posting).

I have easily seen ""Tosca"" more than 100 times, but it wasn't until I saw Dietmar Pflegerl's 2005 production that it hit me: this is not just a love triangle gone bad, there has been a political act, and Scarpia's death will set warring factions against each other - there will be massive civil unrest, violence,  fighting in the streets, people dying for thier causes, and the city will be in flames.  And for 30 years I thought it was just about a fat lady jumping off a roof!",1182816000,4,3260,4.848648648648648
7933185,5,B000059H8H,"Peter Konwitschny, the director of this Tristan & Isolde from the Munich Staatsoper, is controversial. One look at the different ratings of this DVD should give that away.

If you are looking for a traditional Wagner production, do stay away. But approached with an open mind and the desire to be excited by an opera and its production, not merely have expectations reaffirmed, this might well be the best choice.

The singing is, at any rate, beyond criticism. True, John Fredric West's Tristan pales a little next to Waltraud Meier's incandescent Isolde, Kurt Moll's ueber-authoritative King Marke, Bernd Weikl's luxuriously bastardly  Melot... but if that's a 'weakness', it only goes to show how splendidly cast this Tristan is.

The production stands, to this day, as the most exciting opera experience I've ever had (I saw it live in 2001).

The first act immediately connects with the neophyte. Perhaps a cruis-liner and cocktails sipped on lounge-chairs and a sword scene that replaces the sword with an old fashioned razor are not what you want from that act. But it manages to communicate the scene and atmosphere on the Cornwall-headed ship splendidly.

The second act is not my favorite... a flower-pattern upholstered sofa is - pun intended: Blumenbank - the setting where Tristan and Isolde sit down and talk about love for almost two hours.

 Imagine the Castle of Tristan in Act III, kept together as best as the townspeople could, in honor of their beloved but long-gone king... and now he was returned to the existent, if slightly run-down home: over the corner you see the inside of a pale gray barren room. a window, underneath a heating unit and a bucket. The image of a dilapidated home immediately conjured.

Tristan languishes, ill, in memories of his childhood: on a reclining lazy chair, in his right hand the button for the slide projector, projecting unto the wall pictures of his childhood. Tristan with the family's dog at the sea, tristan with mother and aunt etc... The story that the music tells, translated in visual images that go to the core of story and viewer.

This is well thought out, appealing, psychologically more satisfying than a MET production where the protagonists - allegedly in love - don't even touch each other over the course of four hours. It is not the 'usual fare' - but then it isn't intended to be. Caveat emptor - but for those who feel they might be able to befriend such a production, this is a must-have.",1178928000,5,2467,4.852380952380952
7933186,5,B000059H8H,"I'm one of those operalovers who's able to disregard props and sets and costumes that don't accord with my ideal vision of the opera.  I rolled my eyes at the frosted tropical-cocktail glasses (straws! decorative fruit!) but I was able to get past them.  When you have first-rate performers in a production like this, they make the staging and costumes work for them: the ideas come across much better than you'd expect.

And by ""first-rate"" I refer in the mildest, most neutral, qualitative terms to Meier's brilliantly calibrated (both vocally and emotionally) performance.  In my book, she's simply the most complete Isolde ever.  Flagstad, too placid temperamentally but plenty of voice, of course.  Nilsson, plenty of voice but she can't really convey the tenderer moments of the character, like ""Er sah mir in die Augen, sein Elend jammerte mich"" etc..  Margaret Price, Martha Mdl, Helga Dernesch, all present facets of Isolde's character but Watraud Meier offers a really encyclopedic Isolde.  Ever glance, every gesture, every shade of expression, illumines the character she's singing.

And the singing!!!  The whole first act is just magnificent!!  Imagine Eaglen or Voigt throwing themselves into Isolde's bitterness and anger to the extent Meier does!  That kind of ferocity is just not in their arsenal!  Meier is completely in control yet her impassioned outbursts are unhinged, frightening in their intensity.  To see her shift gears and fall in love with Tristan so convincingly and with such melting singing is just a hint of the marvels to come in the later acts.

I'm not a big fan of close-ups of singers when their singing strenuously but when the singer's apparatus is as fascinating to look at as Waltraud Meier's, I'm a convert!!  I love seeing her really unhinge her jaw and deliver that thrilling focussed sound of hers.  And nowhere does she show the slightest signs of strain.  She remains ravishingly beautiful, an ecstatic priestess one moment, the next a wounded bird of prey, the next a young girl falling in love, and all sung with such grandeur and such vividly pronounced words.  I can scarcely believe this astonishing performance can be contained on two little silver disks.  They seem such a mundane pair of objects to hold such a volcanic and magisterial Isolde.

Jon Frederic West is sorely tested by Act III (and who wouldn't be?) and Bernd Weikl can only bark Kurwenal's music.  Marjana Lipovsek does surprising well with her ungainly voice until she gets to ""Einsam wachend..."" where she just doesn't have the technique that would allow her to phrase musically.  Kurt Moll makes a sumptuous Marke but doesn't quite tell the story as rivetingly as Ren Pape but this is Waltraud Meier's show and one well worth watching.",1151712000,32,2761,5.01978021978022

7933188,2,B000059H8H,"As if Wagner's music and poetry could not be trusted, this ""controversial"" (read STUPID) production is like a trash bag full

of silly tricks.  Act I is  garishly staged on a cartoonish yacht (harsh lighting, primary colors, the set like a childs paper cut out), the potions

placed in highball glasses, Tristan SHAVES for almost the

entire act (What in the WORLD does it mean???).  Act II fares

little better, with Tristan rolling on a floral divan on which to sing.

Act III does redeem the whole affair somewhat, with its slideshow

of Tristans childhood memories and muted palette of colors.

Mehta looks embarrassed from the get go, but the orchestra plays beautifully, and the principal singers persevere despite the foolishness

they are called upon to suffer (did I mention the COSTUMES???).

Just AVOID this, especially if it is your first Tristan:  you'll never

return to this opera if this travesty is your maiden voyage.  The

packaging should come with a warning lable. . .",1128297600,12,989,4.903030303030303

I believe this opera represents a pinnacle of his artistic vision and achievement.

So, the level of my expectation was high when I received this DVD and put it into home theatre player.

Well, folks, it is rare that my enthusiasm is betrayed by this magnitude.

This production, directing and staging is simply more than silly.

It is more tragic than the fate of our hero and heroine; Tristan und Isolde!",1125964800,13,452,4.743589743589744
7933190,4,B000059H8H,"Putting aside its flashes of eccentricity (such as the aforementioned sofa, and the shaving soap), this is actually a pretty decent production. Not one of the best I've seen, but streets ahead of the Met DVD.
Waltraud Meier, as always, was superb; not only does she have a wonderful voice, but she can act (unlike Eaglen, in the Met production). She looked damned good in red hair as well.
Jon Fredric West was a competent Tristan, though a little lacking in fire, I think. (He wasn't straining, as another reviewer suggested - he always looks like that).
Kurt Moll brought presence and dignity to what can be a very uninspiring role. His Marke was believable and sympathetic; he commanded the stage in every scene he appeared in.
To return to the production itself - it wasn't all bad. The abrupt transition from night to day, where the stage and house lights were turned on, was particularly effective. I also liked the stage-within-a-stage convention at the end of act three, where the lovers moved into a world of their own, visible to us but out of reach of the other players. I wouldn't categorize this as a 'happy ending', though - just a different way of showing death.
On the technical side, I felt the sound balance was a little strange, with the orchestra occasionally sounding very muted. This was particularly evident in the Liebestod. I wouldn't say that it spoiled my enjoyment of the opera, but it was noticeable.
To sum up, I don't regret buying this DVD, and I don't know of a better DVD production.",1125878400,9,1517,4.685393258426966
