111,5,0005019281,"Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona, but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.
Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.
I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies.",1036195200,4,892,4.656050955414012
112,5,0005019281,"When this first aired in 1979, I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was ""A Christmas Carol"".  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS, I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD, this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago, and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away.",1012176000,3,739,3.8933333333333335
113,5,0005019281,"I must confess to being a bit of a coinsure of Dickens' classic tale.  I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.
In my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.  The material is handled with reverence and respect and it shows, the settings and characters are well conceived, and the look of the film is faithful to the period.  All in  all an excellent holiday piece well worth the money.",1008115200,2,1071,4.6
114,3,0005019281,"If you already have (and love) the Alistair Sim version (Scrooge, 1951), the Reginald Owen version (1938) and Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (no, I'm not kidding, it's beautifully done), this will be an interesting film for comparison.
Two good points stand out for this version of Dicken's classic Christmas story:
1) Since it is an adaptation, set in a different time and place from the original (Depression-era New England), deviations from the text and basic plot-line, are not as bothersome as they are in the films that adapt the story in ""Dickensian"" England.
2) Henry Winkler, who, at the time, was playing against his well-known Fonz character, gives an excellent characterization to the Scrooge-like Benedict Slade.
George C. Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying.",1008028800,31,1114,4.994623655913978
115,4,0005019281,"Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic. One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy. The general feel of this movie, though, is grey. That's the best way to describe it. But then, it was a bleak grey time in American history, with the Great Depression and all. When Dickens originally wrote the book, it was a grey time in England's history as well, so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story.
A nice twist (sorry, Oliver!) to a true classic.
By the way, for my money, the finest original version out there is the George C. Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim.",1003449600,62,785,4.535211267605634

152,5,0005019281,"There are MANY versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" out there. In my humble opinion, this feature length story, set in America during the Great Depression, starring Henry Winkler in the ""Scrooge"" role, is BY FAR the finest interpretation of the classic story. It's as Dickens would have written if he had lived in America in the 1930's. The human drama is REAL, and the joyful ending brings Dickens' ending into the American culture. BIG smile !",1487203200,,440,4.802631578947368

I love the Dicken's story and this was a worthy adaptation that I remembered from my original viewing more than 30 years ago.  Set in early 20th century America, there are a few simple changes from the classic version.  Scrooge is a money lender, having grown rich by lending, then repossessing merchandise when his clients could not keep up on payments.
The ghosts of Christmas past, present and future are represented by some of the clients.  But, anyone familiar with ""The Christmas Carol"", will have no trouble recognizing the storyline.

He asked the viewers to let him know what we thought of him in this role as it was different from the ones most had come to know him (eg.  ""The Fonz"").  When I watched it over 30 years ago, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't until recently I sought it out and watched it again.  It is an excellent retelling of the Dicken's classic with an Americanized twist.  The lessons are timeless and Henry Winkler's Mr Slade is really well done and believable.

Meh...it wasn't bad but given the number of versions of A Christmas Carol that are out there, this ranks pretty low. Henry Winkler gave a wobbly and not very believable version of an American Scrooge, rather like a high school boy playing an old man, and the conversion of the story from England to America felt sort of forced. It just seemed very dated to me.

537,3,0005019281,"A movie with some cute moments, a big nod to the inspiration/source material, and nice setting... Unfortunately, the only thing holding this movie back was.... Henry Winkler.

The Fonz makes an awful Scrooge, or Slade, in this case. His acting isn't horrible, but it's also not that good. There seems very little emotion in his transition from corrupt, hateful, ""covetous old sinner"" to changed man, learning to care for others. He's stiff and seemingly insincere. (His interaction with the young boy at the end is a little creepy too. ""You're going to come for a ride with me."" Ew.)

His character is too old looking... it looks like he could kick the bucket any moment (yet he runs around like a man quite a bit younger), and caused a disconnect and confusion while visiting with The Ghost of Christmas Past.

I mean, it's not horrible, but I certainly didn't like it as much as many of the other Christmas Carol adaptations out there.

If you're looking to watch A Christmas Carol, I recommend the George C. Scott version for a wonderfully sarcastic Ghost of Christmas Present who gives Scrooge a good dose of his own medicine (however, the scene with Ignorance and Want may be scary to children*), or A Muppet Christmas Carol for a surprisingly touching musical adaptation- I promise the songs aren't too hokey. And the literature, narrated by Gonzo, is very close to the source material (very family friendly).

*They appear near the end of the Ghost of Christmas Present's time, while Scrooge witnesses the struggle of a homeless family (the spirit keeps Ignorance and Want under his robe).",1419292800,,1596,4.852941176470588

563,5,0005019281,"I do. I like every well made version I have seen.
This one, in my opinion is the best.
Without spoiling anything for you, here is why.
The setting is in a small New Hampshire town.
It is the tail end of the great depression.
We, in the USA, can relate to this as, know it or not, it has greatly influenced todays society.

Our grandparents  were very thrifty throughout their lives as a result of these hard times.
Then, many of their children, as adults did a complete turnaround when it comes to spending, credit, and unknowingly influenced this me me me society we now witness. So now, maybe more than in Dickens' time, we can benefit from such a lesson.

More important, in my opinion, is the detail the writer used when the ghost of past showed Slade of his childhood as well as the detail of Slade's reaction at the end.
This big tough guy's eyes well up everytime I watch it.

As a couple others said, I stumbled on this movie on TV. Mid 1990's .TBS?  Quickly put in a vhs tape to record. Later,  with software, switched all my tapes to DVD.
This one, on switching, the last minute or two were destroyed.  Plus, the fact that I didn't record the very beginning and the way networks edit out several minutes to cram extra commercials, I am so looking forward to seeing, for the first time, the entire movie.

Henry Winkler (famous for playing ""the Fonz"" on Happy Days) proves his acting abilities and range of emotions in this satisfying film.  Some unexpected twists and just enough grit to make it evocative of Depression Era America make this a nice take on the Christmas classic.  (P.S.  Just wait for the Ghost of Christmas Futureso wouldn't think that would work out well, but it did!!!  That's all I'm saying. Love it.)",1388188800,,536,4.846153846153846

I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story, acting, directing, camera work, costumes, sets, locations, music, and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor, but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.

690,5,0005019281,"The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.  Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.  Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.  This is an annual ""must watch"" story for me.",1387497600,,424,5.0285714285714285

715,3,0005019281,Worth watching this new version of the classic.  It is a little slow in parts but still entertaining. The real negative issue and distraction throughout is Henry Winkler's make up that is supposed to make him look old.  It just looks like Henry Winkler with make-up that is supposed to make him look old.  Even if you did not know the actor you would know that it was makeup and not an old man.  The wig was very good though--looked very authentic.,1385251200,2,448,4.426829268292683

756,5,0005019281,"This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character, although well known by most, is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right.

788,1,0005019281,"Dickens writing is poetry of the highest order, and as a story teller he has few peers.  Henry Winkler's monotone delivery of the Christmas Carol combined with a trite and confusing screen play was only made worse by the frequent interruptions of a black screen, since this was an adaptation of a TV production in 1979 converted to a DVD.  The make-up in the movie was distracting to a fault, looking like it had been applied with a masonry trowel and topped by one of the worst hairpieces since George Burns was alive.

Although the new Scrooge's premise had promise by changing the setting of the story from Victorian England to Depression Era America, the writers did not take advantage of the fairy tale capacities of the story and moral lessons, best taught as allegories.  In this sense having the four visitations (Marley, plus Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) done in the context of real-life characters from the TV production itself, had a less dramatic impact on the events.  Simply stated, Marley should have been a tortured spirit, attempting to right a long life of wrong decisions instead of appearing like a characterized mobster from a B-movie.  In addition the 70's hipster, as Christmas Yet to Come, was several decades from being relevant to the plot, or as sinister, foreboding and silent as the representation of a lonely death.  Last, but not least, the conclusion of the story appeared rushed and lacked substance, more so than many versions I have seen. In this sense sending the young boy to Australia to cure his malady was more detail than I required and most likely confusing to anyone not familiar with the period in America.

This review (2012) is based on a recent watching of the video I purchased a number of years ago for my collection. However, if you are reading this you should understand the context in which the TV movie was made.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity from the Happy Days series when he portrayed this part, and in addition to his early success, has evolved into an accomplished actor, director, producer and author.  It all goes to show you that one bad decision does not a career make, so there is hope for all of us, every one.",1354406400,3,2201,4.693506493506494

I like the original story better, that is why I gave it 4 stars. It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge, even with the name changes. It is the same general idea.

For me I like this version because it explains more of the back story for the Scrooge character. I also like in the end that despite having his change of heart he is still very much himself. In stead of all of the sudden being great with kids and more at ease in social settings, he is still somewhat uncomfortable in these situations. For me it was a little more realistic.

I believe Happy Days was still on tv at this time albiet it was probably during the end of the series. The only place to find this movie was through Amazon just as they don't play it on tv you can't find the dvd in the stores either so the ability to find this movie was almost impossible except thankfully through Amazon.

This is a well written, well directed and edited movie.  Not corny but as the title denotes, with a script that moves away from the original script.  In this era of NAFTA and trade treaties this message is as timely as it was in the period of the movie.

I loved this movie as it was an interesting and engaging alternative to the more common Scott and Finney versions of the classic Christmas Carol that always got the most airtime. It depicts depression era New England with a cold, grey feeling that really comes across the screen without bogging the movie down and having grown up in Boston, it makes it that much more intersting to me. The acting is top-notch, particularly from Henry Winkler. It was always one of my favorite Christmas specials. Then it went off the air never to return sometime back then (80's, 90's, I'm not sure exactly when) and I never forgot about it and often pined to watch it again but somehow always seemed to forget to look for it on VHS, DVD, or online.

830,4,0005019281,"The best thing about this movie is that its not much different than the Christmas Carols that came before it.

Seriously, the setting is changed, its moved to a small New England town during the Great Depression. This is the perefect setting, the time and place are quite reminiscent of Dickens' London, so you don't have the distraction from making major changes. Aside from the setting, you have a fairly typical Christmas Carol. Sure, Henry Winkler's Benedict Slade doesn't go around saying bah humbug, nor does he have a nephew, but he's no different than Ebeneezer Scrooge. Nor is he a boy growing up in a boarding school (tyical for England at the time) hated by his father for his mother dying in childbirth, instead he's an orphan. Same impact, but appropriate for the time and place.

As a TV movie, its a bit lacking compared to other versions, the budget is more visible than typical, but wise use of settings and lesser TV actors help. While many of the supporting cast are familiar, none are stars of any sort, just standard supporting actors. The play like use of three of Slade's debtors to represent the three spirits works very well, giving their parts more weight and saving the production money, ditto for the reuse of sets when they're not outside. The ghost of Christmas future is the greatest departure from the original, after all, in this movie he can talk, and we actually see what he looks like. And his very dated arrival is a bit funnier than was intended, but that journey still carries weight.

Over all, well done and believable without significantly rewriting a classic. I recommend this as the best of the alternates for those who like a bit of variety without a complete rewrite of the story.",1260662400,,1726,4.708609271523179

845,5,0005019281,"93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption.

An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.
-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.
-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.

""Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.""
""Thank God,"" Slade responds.
""It's worse,"" Latham says.

A short while later Slade says ""But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!""
""Evil isn't just what you do,"" Latham replies, ""It's also what you DON'T do.""

A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.
-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.
-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.
-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. ""Did you read that book, Mister Slade?"" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.
""The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?""
""Humbug?""",1224892800,,2728,4.785562632696391

Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three ""ghosts"" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the ""romantic"" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.

This movie hasn't played on TV in at least a decade that I remember, and it should be, for it's a fresh take on the old Dickens tale.

The setting is Concord, NH in 1933, and miserly Benedict Slade goes about repossessing people's furniture, stoves, radios - and even a piano from a children's orphanage! - on Christmas Eve.

863,4,0005019281,"I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.

I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.

I am fond of ""An American Christmas Carol"" because it is set during the Depression and shows aspects of American society during that period.  The primary element missing from this version of the story is that Scrooge's sister and, hence, her son (Scrooge's nephew) are missing from this version, presumably in order to fit the original version within a specific time frame.  As a result the story element where the nephew's friends ridicule Scrooge's miserliness, and the corresponding redemptive element after the visitations are missing.

879,3,0005019281,"For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this ""American-ized"" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.

The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.

In a bit of ridiculousness, the ""Ghost of Christmas Future"" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their ""Ghost of the Future"" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.

Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like ""A CHristmas Carol"" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.",1102377600,9,1539,4.937984496124031

882,5,0005019281,"Bonjour!
Je crois que de toutes les versions qui ont t faites du conte de Charles Dickens, celle-ci est sans doute  la fois la plus originale et la plus fidle.  Le thme central est bien respect mais l'adaptation est totale puisqu'elle situe l'action en Amrique plutt que dans l'Angleterre du 19e sicle mais avec une touche dbut du sicle et moderne.
Mme si ce film n'est disponible qu'en anglais sur DVD, il vaut la peine d'tre achet puisqu'il n'est plus diffus  la tlvision depuis plusieurs annes suite  une msentente avec le producteur et il semble bien que la situation n'est pas prs de changer.  C'est un film de collection que tous se doivent de possder pour le temps de Nol.  Une version franaise a jadis t disponible mais elle ne l'est plus maintenant ce qui est trs malheureux.  Henry Winkler est remarquable.",1041292800,2,816,4.704225352112676
883,5,0005019281,"Like many other reviewers, I first saw this as a kid on television in '79 and Henry Winkler's ""Fonzie"" persona was still so much a part of the cultural fabric that it was somewhat shocking to even think of him, much less see him, as anything else.
However, I was transfixed by this adaptation on the Dickens story and was genuinely moved by Winkler's ( Benedict Slade ) transformation at the end. Winkler is simply superb: believable, funny, dramatic, and imminently likable even as the curmudgeon. The supporting cast is wonderful as well even though most of them, with the possible exception of David Wayne, will be unknown to most viewers. The actor who plays Thatcher (the ""Cratchit"" character in the Dickens novel) does a wonderful job of being as compassionate as the role demands without being too ""soft"".
The actors playing the roles of Mr. Brewster and Helen Brewster also hold their own and give Winkler solid performances to react to even with limited screen time.
The movie looks and feels like I would imagine turn of the century and Depression era New England to look and feel like to an outsider: quaint, majestic, proud; yet tired and despairing.
My only problem with the movie, and this is REALLY nitpicking, is that they simply made Winkler look too old for the latter Slade (""Scrooge"") part. the movie does an excellenet job of letting us know when things are happening, even in the Christmas Past scenarios, e.g., we know Slade and Helen broke up around 1917 because of the backdrop of the war effort (WW I). The contemporary story is set in 1933 and Slade looks like he has aged forty years instead of only 16 or so. He looks MUCH older than his contemporaries. However, maybe they intended to achieve this effect to accentuate his gnarliness. I just thought it was too much. The only other thing is that many of the actors are obviously Canadian born (Mr. and Mrs. Thatcher and Helen , for example)and several times their Canadian tones and speech patterns come out. This is noticeable particularly against the distinctive New England accents employed throughout the rest of the picture.
I recommend this DVD highly for anyone who loves the Christmas season, the Dickens novel in particular, Henry Winkler, or just any good heartwarming story. I looked for this on DVD and/or VHS for almost twenty years. It was worth the wait.",1040601600,11,2349,4.788177339901478
884,5,0005019281,"""A Christmas Carol"" may well be the most-adapted Christmas story in literature, with version ranging from whimsical to musical to deadly serious.  This particular version, starring Henry Winkler as Benedict Slade (a.k.a. Scrooge) is my favorite.
The movie translates Dickens' classic story from 19th century England to Depression-era New England.  The result is very effective.  For me, an American born to parents who grew up in the Depression, the 20th century setting made the story feel very real.  The writers and director made excellent decisions in their choice of sets.  Three notable examples were the New England furniture factory as the setting for Slade's youth, the newly-conceived idea of consumer credit as the source of his subsequent wealth and avarice, and the choice of an African-American as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (""You must be Future,"" Slade declares, cowering before him).
Winkler's performance is brilliant.  He captures the essence of Slade perfectly, and makes the gradual transformation from miser to redeemed man seem natural and believable.  The scene at the Thatcher (a.k.a. Cratchit) household at the end of the film never fails to bring tears to my eyes and those of my family.  The supporting cast performs ably as well, making this a Christmas classic that one can watch every year.
""An American Christmas Carol"" debuted in 1979, midway through Winkler's popular ""Happy Days"" television series run.  After a few years of reruns, it disappeared from view until recently, when it became available on DVD and video.  I heartily recommend it for your holiday DVD collection.",1040601600,34,1616,5.228682170542636
