2569986,1,B000FKO41Q,The movie sucks to be honest. Harvey Keitel kept it going but even he stunk. Best thing about this picture was the introduction of EW&F. The plot and the characters just didn't seem to flow with the story line...had a hard time keeping up with what was going on. The only reason I purchased this DVD was to watch EW&F. They should stick with singing.,1175212800,5,350,4.4

2569988,2,B000FKO41Q,"I ain't seen this Movie in over 20 plus years,but as a Huge Earth,Wind&fire Fan i had to check it out again.it was corny back then&still is. Sig Shore who did ""Superfly"" brings back the Corrupt Captain from Superfly to play the Record Label head who sell this Record Company away. also Freddie from superfly  plays a Minister&also Janitor in this film.  Harvey Keitel plays the SuperStar Producer battling the Label big-wig at pushing the Group as EWF is known as in the Film. this Film in alot of ways was a pre-cursor to Prince's Purple Rain. EWF had the same Management as Prince later had &prince's character in PR was The Kid.  some interesting things they share. but anyay the story line about the music industry is the same then as it is now. talk about irony? I gotta think that yeah this film was done in 1975,but the same rules&overall vibe applies in 2006.  in truth Earth,Wind&Fire hardly have any real roles beyond on stage performance. it was cool to see Maurice White at the start of the film playing the African Instrument the Kalimba. it's a trademark of the EWF Sound. that era of EWF is them at there best.all the Original gang that was the Real FIRRE!! this film didn't do jack for there careeers because only die hard EWF fans remember it. the Album though ""that's the way of the World"" is one of there best. good to hear there instrumental breakdowns&it all coming together.  this as a Film was cheap, poorly edited&under-written. it could have been way better if edited better, better written&also more story to connect. would have been a tight Documentary. I enjoyed the Music Performance scenes.",1157760000,2,1620,4.670175438596491

THATS THE WAY OF THE WORLD

First Time on Home VideoAvailable July 18th For $19.98;

Coinciding with Earth, Wind & Fires Summer Concert Tour;

Breakthrough Film Score Features Classic Hits

Shining Star and Reasons

Also Available This Summer in HD-DVD Format

Los Angeles, CA Theyre one of the most inspirational, influential and successful bands in music history, and have consistently changed the face of R&B and pop music over the past 35 years. In 1975, their breakthrough hits Shining Star and Reasons were the featured songs on the soundtrack for the film Thats the Way of the World. Fresh on the heels of their 23rd album, Illumination, BCI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Navarre Corporation, will release this long thought lost film Thats the Way of the World on DVD July 18th, at a suggested retail price of $19.98. The title will also be available this summer in the HD-DVD format. Featuring an array of special features, Thats the Way of the World explores the politics that surround the recording industry and a producer trying to fight the system, and stars Harvey Keitel and Earth, Wind & Fire.

Earth, Wind & Fire has reached iconic status in the music industry, earning a plethora of accolades too numerous to mention, said Ed Goetz, President, BCI. This film and soundtrack helped skyrocket their career, and were pleased that it will finally be available to the widest audience possible.

Thats the Way of the World stars Keitel as Coleman Buckmaster, a highly-regarded record producer who appreciates the talent of The Group, played by Earth, Wind & Fire. But the system under which Buckmaster works sees things differently. The record executives want him to focus on a white pop act whom they feel has the sound America wants. To keep his creative integrity, Buckmaster carefully begins to fight the system that has made him the respected producer he has become.

Special features include:

Feature length audio commentary with Earth, Wind & Fire members Verdine White and Ralph Johnson

I can't review this Movie because... almost immediately upon starting-up this disc, the Audio was ridiculously out-of-sync.  At first I assumed it was just bad editing in the opening Musical Segment, but afterwards it was obvious that there are serious sync issues here.  So I didn't get a chance to enjoy this Movie at all.

I have a PS3 that I play all my Blu-Rays from.  So, this may be be a PS3 Issue, but I haven't had any other Sync Problems in the last few years.",1404691200,,536,4.484536082474227

2570024,4,B000FKO41Q,"as another reviewer here has pointed out.  This is a low budget movie that I personally highly recommend for one reason: There are scenes in it that explain why bad/weak music and barely talented performers become popular: muscle, $, and hype/advertising. Not very many movies address this harsh reality.  Some great books that have documented this in detail are:  ""Stiffed, a true story of MCA, the music business, and the Mafia"" by William Knoedelseder,  ""Hit Men"" by Fredric Dannen,  ""Confessions of a Record Producer"" by Moses Avalon, ""The Real Frank Zappa Book"" by Frank Zappa, and Jimmy Bowen's ""Rough Mix"".  I also liked this movie because it is in a way a gritty ""time capsule"" of the 1970's in the USA / NYC area.  In general, a fun flick, and something a bit unique.",1379116800,2,776,4.746268656716418

Great historical viewing of two careers emerging onto their respective stages, Harvey Keitel's film career and of course the reason I bought the DVD Earth Wind and Fire's film debut and launching of their amazing musical career!!

2570028,5,B000FKO41Q,"I am a die hard Earth, Wind and Fire fan. I always wanted to see this movie. While E,W & F won't get any Oscar's for acting it was entertaining none the less.",1357171200,,158,3.8181818181818183
2570029,5,B000FKO41Q,"I remember back around 1976 when a friend of mine brought the album ""That's the Way of the World"" over to my house.  I read the cover and saw that the album was a soundtrack to a movie.  I wondered why I had never heard of this movie and why nobody I knew ever talked about it.  Now I know why...because it SUCKED!  No, I'm kidding.  It's because it came in and out of theaters so quickly that practically no one saw it.

This movie is worth the price of admission if only just to see Charles Stepney in the studio, and actually playing the piano, albeit he only plays a few chords.  The other interesting parts for me were the studio scenes where the session musicians laid down the tracks for that crappy song by The Pages.

You could take the plot and dialogue of this movie and apply it to the present day music industry and it will answer your question ""Why is music such crap these days?""",1356480000,7,894,4.2176470588235295
2570030,5,B000FKO41Q,"So, I've finally purchased & seen this film just yesterday; and I must say that I enjoyed it very much. If you are a fan of Earth, Wind & Fire, it is imperative that you watch this at least once to say that you've seen it. There are strengths as well as weaknesses about this film. First, allow us to start with the weaknesses: the dialogue in certain cases was a bit awkward and the screenplay's jargon could have been better written. A second weakness was the acting, in which some of it really wasn't too great. In my opinion, it all stems from a somewhat poorly written screenplay - if the writing is off, it makes the actors look out of place - even if the film consists of fabulous actors - Harvey Keitel being one and at times his delivery had an unusual, unnatural sound.

Some strengths included the wonderful music of the style that only Earth, Wind & Fire can possess. Another was the all-around message that the film was attempting to get across and in my eyes, that was pushing through your trials and tribulations no matter how rough the going gets. It also brought to the light differences between real artists and those who are just craving to be in the limelight for the wrong reasons. The closest example in which I can best describe it is one or more who feel books but fail to read them. In this case, the fictional Caucasian family group, The Pages and those in the positions of power of the record company, A-Chord, didn't see the importance of good music. They only looked forward to the outcome and its riches. Truthfully speaking, The Pages actually did have a decent sound, naturally Earth, Wind & Fire (The Group) was much better, however, they took their talents for granted with their ways of living - a wasted talent at the end of the day and this was brought upon by two of the three Pages mostly.

After carefully gathering my thoughts of the movie, I kind of had the feeling that the message this film was trying to portray is highly similar to the way the business is in today's music industry. There are many unsung talents of all kinds who have the capability and power within to do such wonderful, legendary things to enhance the goodness of this business but are placed on the back burner completely due to those in power who make it painfully obvious that they are careless about ""great music"". Their carelessness is such that they are willing to sell and market garbage just for success. It makes you sick almost to witness what people will do in order to receive fame. Harvey Keitel (Coleman Buckmaster) along with EWF had an amazing vision and way to relate to every day people through music. The future of music was very important to each of them but was best seen through Maurice White's character, Early, and Buckmaster.

The portrayal whose I enjoyed the most was Maurice's. He was always my favorite in Earth, Wind & Fire ever since I was 2 years old. I really did enjoy his friendship with Harvey Keitel's character; they were both two geniuses really, who shared the same love and passion for music. They were the two who the other band mates had counted on more than anyone else and for the most part Maurice trusted and believed in him when no one else really had. Even as Buckmaster left The Group blowing in the wind, what he and Maurice shared showed itself to be great once Maurice voiced his disappointments, but the film's end gave me great hope and faith that no matter how high to the top you go, those who'd done a tremendous deal in helping you succeed are the key ones never forgotten.

I strongly recommend this film to anyone with a dream. No matter what it is, continue to reach for the stars - while others may be an influence, only you can stop yourself from becoming your absolute best.",1349136000,5,3754,4.491947291361639
2570031,3,B000FKO41Q,"When I got my own copy of the ""That's the Way of the World"" album in 7th grade (around '87), I noticed ""hidden text"" that said that it was the soundtrack to a movie of the same name. I'd always wanted to see the movie, and since I AM a gung-ho EWF fan, that's why I bought it.

As a movie, IT'S NOT GREAT. The acting is sub-par (and that's saying A LOT since this came out during the so-called ""Blaxploitation"" era), and it seems that the writers rely on cliches in portraying many of the characters. I give the Maurice White and the other cats an ""A"" for effort for the little bit of acting they try to do, though. They're not in the movie very much. Like others have said, there's only a little bit of live peformance footage.

From the perspective of a musician, FUNKATEER, and EWF lover, though, the opening scene of the movie is what I enjoyed the most...seeing the cats in a simulated studio situation. For other connoisseurs of soul, a real treat is getting to see footage and hear the voice of Charles Stepney (who tries some acting), EWF's legendary producer and arranger. Also there are a couple of montage's demonstrating the recording/creative process. These were truly pleasures to watch.

As far as the extras were concerned, no big whoop. I was particularly disappointed with the commentary. Ralph Johnson's voice came through loud and clear, but it sounded like Verdine White was on the other side of the room without a mic and was largely hard to understand throughout. How the producers of the package allowed that to happen is beyond me.

All in all, it you're an EWF completist, you should own this DVD...just BECAUSE. For the rest of you, well, you can take it or leave it.",1334880000,5,1694,4.526143790849673
2570032,4,B000FKO41Q,"The score for this film is, without doubt, a work of utter brilliance and the highlight of the film.  But before I get underway, I would like to address comments made by Fernando Gonzalez dated October 29, 2007 where he, being uncomfortable with the brilliance of Earth, Wind and Fire and wanting to try and downplay their obvious significance, makes several rather ridiculous statements.

He's clearly a Beatles fan and unable to cope with a band who forged their own path and did things that quite frankly were not done before as The Elements.  I was curious were this came from, so I read the other reviews listed here and didn't see anyone that mentioned the Beatles but were giving praise, rightfully so, to The Elements.

Let me first say that while I respect what the Beatles did, it is completely uninformed to think that they are the ""center of the musical universe"" for every artist.  To try and down play Earth, Wind and Fire's undeniable and historical influence to build up the Beatles makes no sense.  There is absolutely nothing the Beatles did that Earth, Wind and Fire didn't do and they were an overall superior band.  Earth, Wind and Fire are the ""center of the musical universe"" for many artists who have stated so over and over again.

Let's be clear, Verdine White liked the Beatles, he stated that it was his brothers Maurice and Fred who were his main influences along with Motown.  I've read no articles nor seen any interviews where any other band member and they were 9 members strong who list the Beatles as any type of influence.  So in response to another statement made in the review ""I'm sure Maurice is happy about any comparisons to the Beatles"" quite frankly, this doesn't hold water.  He was influenced by the sounds of Memphis TN were he was born and grew up and Chicago were he and his family later moved.  He was a legend prior to forming Earth, Wind and Fire as the session drummer for Chess Records in the 1960's and member of the Ramsey Lewis Trio.

Now to the review of the film:

The plot for this film was actually fairly decent, it deals with the shady side of the music industry including it's bigotry and ties with ""unsavory"" characters.  ""The Group"" (Earth, Wind & Fire) is a band trying to make it to the ""big time"" but is not considered palatable for the new, bigoted and crooked record executive who has just been assigned by the new owners of the label to find a band or group that the company could build it's success around.  The company has a hot shot producer (Keitel) who wants to promote ""The Group"" as the band to carry the label into the next phase of it's existence.  They were already signed to the label and where a self contained band that had all the makings of a super group!

Instead, the record exec, without the knowledge of his star producer, hires this far less talented and completely unknown singng trio who fit what the exec felt the record industry should be about, i.e. a white artist with the ""supposed purity"" of artists back in the 1950's.  There was nothing pure about them and their talent or lack thereof caused a rift between Keitel's character and his.  Keitel was caught between a rock and a hard place, on the one hand he knew ""The Group"" was the next ""big thing"" and he was a loyal friend of everyone in the band.  On the other hand, he had a father who was a addict and got his fix from his son, Keitel, who obtained it from one of the execs at the label.  Plus he was also under contract to the label with a clause that forced him to unemployed, unable to join another label, for a year if he quit.

The main reason I give this film 4 instead of 5 stars is that Earth, Wind and Fire should have been one of the primary focuses of the film and were not.  They are more of a secondary thought and although spoken of quite a bit are rarely ever seen.  There are some incredible live and recorded performances and the soundtrack is of course legendary in and of itself.  However, if you were going to include them in the movie, they should have played a more significant role.  Especially with the plot being what it was.

The film could have explored more of the day to day life of ""The Group"" and the struggles they went through while being constantly overlooked and placed on ""hold"" while their white contemporaries and a less talented group where moved ahead of them and allowed to have their songs recorded, marketed and released to the awaiting masses.  I think this is the missing link in the movie that leaves something to be desired by the viewers.",1334534400,3,4543,4.466101694915254

Harvey Keitel played an excellent role, and impressed me with how music is put together and the process before it actually is put out. The elements (Earth, Wind and Fire) have been my favorite group of all time, and they were good too!

Well, the film is ""ok"", but that's not what you purchase it for... you want to see the band as they were: full of energy and fire!",1255824000,,310,3.859375
2570037,5,B000FKO41Q,"What can I say, EWF is the band of all time!
CD plays great!",1254873600,,60,3.357142857142857
2570038,2,B000FKO41Q,"Irony? It's a pity. Back when this movie was originally made in 1975, movies starring black artists had a tendency to be short on plot, budget, & actual input from the actors. There was precious little input from the members of EWF, & the story line suffered. Of course Sig Shore of Superfly fame was notorious for these movies, & in true form the REAL stars of the movie, EWF,had little more than a cameo appearance in a movie named after their breakthrough LP. They litteraly mirrored the record labels brush off of the Group (EWF) in the movie. Although the live footage, & the instrumental backing done by EWF was stellar, there was precious little of it. Even Harvey Kietel couldn't save such a bad script. Sad to say most record companys still do business in this fashion, so the script comes off as sad but true. It's a fair assessment of the music & the blacksplotation films of the time, & a sad assessment of the music industry as a whole. Not a great film, but entertaining none the less. Outside of EWF's music, I'd say the plot reeks of Saturday Night Fever psydo drama. If you're a big EWF fan, you'll enjoy their music, but be prepared for a long wait to get to it. Rare film. The movie is OK.",1204070400,12,1208,4.397321428571429
2570039,5,B000FKO41Q,"E W & F were and still are brilliant and also great performers. I think one of the best R&B groups still around, but lets not get carried away, there will never be a musical entity bigger than the Beatles. They are the center of the musical universe for every artist out there and they will always remain there as the standard of what a music group can accomplish.
But I am glad there are a lot of E W & F remastered albums available now. The sound quality and brilliance with horns and vocals shines like never before.
I am sure Maurice White is indeed grateful and in owe his group is being compared to the Beatles.",1193616000,2,617,4.237288135593221
8123940,5,B000FKO41Q,like the movie very much but it started out alittle slow,1483747200,,56,4.181818181818182
8123941,3,B000FKO41Q,"Let me be the first to say that until yesterday, I had NO earthly idea that movie even existed. I was reading Maurice White's memoirs on his life, and he brought up how That's the Way of the World came about. So, being curious, I came on Amazon to see if it was on sale(it is). then I thought that since this was an older movie, I ought to be able to see it on YouTube(I was). it's about a producer(a young Harvey Keitel), with a nose for hits and he's convinced the group he's working with aptly named The Group(played by Earth Wind and Fire) will be able to do that. The company he works for, however, does not share the same viewpoint, and brings in another group called The Pages(a whole other type of genre altogether) to make them stars. Although this Pages group seems nice and wholesome, all is not as it seems. Meanwhile, The Group is all but dropped from the attentions of the powers that be for The Pages(Sandra Botsick, Bert Parks and Jimmy Boyd), and Keitel is caught between a rock and a hard place. Things get a bit stickier when the girl lead singer(Sandra Botsick) gets interested in him(Keitel), thinking that she can hook up with him and he can help her career further even more and things get even more complicated. I would add more, but if your interested, I'll leave out the spoilers. Interesting flick on the recording business and how things can change at the drop of a hat. UPDATE: Earth Wind & Fire's ""That's the Way of the World"" is actually the soundtrack for the movie with solely their music. Maurice White in his memoirs speak on keeping it that way so that it could ""stand alone"" from the movie. There is a scene where EW&F are performing ""Happy Feelings"" in the skating arena and the people are vibing, skating and dancing to the music. Love that scene.",1474588800,,1786,4.4316109422492405
8123942,4,B000FKO41Q,"I saw this movie for the first time a few years ago. I was interested in how Earth, Wind & Fire were as actors and it was entertaining.  When I first heard the demo that was played by The Pages, I laughed.
But the scene where the main character is recording the individual instruments and vocals to the song, what I heard caught me off gaurd.

I was literally moved to tears because the way the arrangement of the ""Joy"" song was simply beautiful.
It's too bad that song wasn't offically released. I would love a copy of the completed track.",1474416000,,540,4.336633663366337

8123944,3,B000FKO41Q,"This is a movie from the 1970s. It was bad then and worse today. However, I am a huge earth, wind & fire fan and thus seeing this movie with them was worth the poor screenplay and editing. I knew what I was getting. Good contemporary liner notes.",1466899200,,246,4.145833333333333
