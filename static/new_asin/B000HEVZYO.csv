The content of the DVD can be found for free, on the well-known Internet group forums offering Cats' T-Training etc. Search yahoo or google it in. Vendor offers no support or troubleshooting for problems where as the big forum groups do, also for free!

Seller uses the turkey roaster for a litter pan. A pan is flimsy and the cat's body weight causes the aluminum to bend and snap. The cat is spooked and never goes near the toilet again. Sharp edges are a hazard to the cat's paws and small children. Her concept to tape the pan to the toilet seat means if you don't have a spare toilet, you have to un-tape the pan when humans want to use it. The method is as old as using the plastic wrap- also unsuccessful.

Essentially, with a little browsing you could pick up a better way to train your cat and the cost would be FREE.

The DVD is very informational and easy to follow, so even Maynard is catching on!  They take you through step by step so you can guide your cat along the way.  I love potty-trained Maynard.  They mention you save on kitty litter, but I also save on dry cleaning, carpet cleaning, and all those other products for his old ""accidents"".  Highly recommended!",1155859200,12,504,4.606741573033708
8139231,5,B000HEVZYO,This has proven to be a great tool in dealing with our stubborn cat!  It is getting the hang of it.  I would recommend this DVD highly.,1155772800,5,135,3.962962962962963
