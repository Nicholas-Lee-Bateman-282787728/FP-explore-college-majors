1850447,5,B00008L3TW,"""You wanna know another thing I hate?  Senseless evil.""

Having perused the IMDB comments for ""It's Pat,"" it looks like most people genuinely LOATHE this film.  I really don't understand why.  Yes, there are only so many ""is it a man or woman?"" type of jokes that one can stand but, much like the MacGruber movie, there is much much more to the movie than the simple premise of the original SNL skit.

As for the Pat character, if you find him/her annoying as hell, then the film achieved its purpose.  Pat's unfounded hubris and complete inability to self-reflect presaged many characters that are very popular in comedies today--e.g., Will Ferrell's Ricky Bobby and Ron Burgundy, or Danny's McBride's Kenny Powers.  But again, the movie doesn't hinge on the Pat character; there is much else worth noting.

For me, the insanely fast, downward-spiral transformation of Pat's neighbor, Kyle, is absolutely hysterical and is worth watching on its own.  Without his character, the film would have been considerably worse-off, in my opinion.  Plus the film has all the senseless silliness of other SNL movies (e.g., Wayne's World), plus lots of great cameos (Dave Foley is great, of course, as is Tim Meadows, and many others).

In sum, it's really easy to hate the Pat character (which, again, is exactly Pat's purpose). Unlike, say, Kenny Powers, Pat has absolutely NO redeeming qualities. Thus, it is really easy to simply transfer hatred of Pat into hatred for this film.  But watching it a bit more closely, and appreciating the clever, more subtle silliness of some of the film's parts, is totally worth it.  If you like some of the more deranged SNL comedies (e.g., MacGruber and Wayne's World), I really don't understand why you wouldn't find this film funny.  And, in contrast to some of the other early 90s comedies (e.g., ones that relied on a lot of slapstick humor), I actually think the subtle, occasionally demented style of humor in It's Pat holds up remarkably well to today's off-beat comedies.  It's not as under-rated as Dirty Work (which is sheer brilliance), but it is under-rated nonetheless.  Give it a chance!",1385683200,3,2131,4.910614525139665

1850449,3,B00008L3TW,"I was expecting ""It's Pat"" to be on the same level of Wayne's World or Wayne's World 2, but this movie wasn't as funny as I expected.

The main plot revolves around Pat falling in love with another that is just as androgynous as Pat. While it had its funny moments like one of Pat's neighbors becoming extremely obsessed with finding out if Pat is a man or a woman, this movie is mediocre at best.

1850468,3,B00008L3TW,"I was floored going through all the reviews of ""It's Pat"".  There were a plethora of one and five star reviews but little in the middle which is where my opinion lies.  Julia Sweeney's Pat is an inspired creation that worked as an occasional SNL skit.  My favorite sketch involved Pat being stranded on a desert island with Harvey Keitel.  In voiceover Keitel reveals that he still hasn't discovered Pat's gender after numerous sexual encounters. There's nothing wrong with Sweeney's performance who in real life is a beautiful woman.  The mere fact that she keeps you guessing at the ambiguity of her character's gender is all the more amazing.  Equally fine is Dave Foley as Pat's beau Chris.  There's real chemistry and electricity, literally and figuratively, between he and Sweeney.  The problem is there's not much of a story here or possibly the one-joke nature of the premise is stretched way too thin.  Even the Roxbury boys made a more satisfying film out of very little.  When this played theatrically, if it lasted very long or was tested in many markets, it was savaged by the critics.  That's entirely unfair because this is not a bad movie just a very slight one.  I will say I've never seen a film like ""It's Pat"" and for better or for worse I hope they never make another film like it.",1301097600,2,1302,4.662280701754386
1850469,5,B00008L3TW,"It's really a shame that people haven't given this movie the chance it deserves!  It's Pat is absolutely HILARIOUS from start to finish.  It's been judged really harshly and that's not fair.

The character Pat comes from a series of Saturday Night Live sketches that ran in the early 1990s, which was the best time for SNL.  Clearly the movie has to have some merits to have been approved by someone like Lorne Michaels.

Julia Sweeney is absolutely perfect as Pat, the main character.  I really don't understand how she didn't have a bigger career after this movie, because she's hilarious imo.  Putting in a comedy legend like Dave Foley really sent the movie over the edge.  He plays Chris, another person of indeterminable sex and the love interest of Pat.  The two have a lot of chemistry, I think!  Charles Rocket, who was also on SNL, really gets to show how great of a comedian he really is.  He's makes a great villain!

I think that the connection to SNL is one of the major reasons that critics have judged this film so harshly.  People went in expecting another Wayne's World and didn't give It's Pat it's own chance to shine!  The two have completely different styles of comedy.

It's Pat was DEFINITELY ahead of its time.  The influences from this film can be seen across a lot of different comedies, like in Judd Apatow movies.  It's Pat can rely on stupid humour a little too much sometimes, but that makes it even funnier!  Everyone loves an easy laugh and this movie delivers.

People NEED to give this movie another shot!  Buy the DVD and see just how great this overlooked comedy is!",1299542400,2,1603,4.577464788732394

1850472,4,B00008L3TW,"Synopsis

This film was directed by Adam Bernstein. An androgynous person tries to answer the hard questions in life about love and their career and evaluate themselves. His/Her friends also have a hard time trying to figure out their gender. If I was Pats friend I would be trying to get into bed with them so I could find out their gender. Some androgynous people turn me on.

Plot Rating

We've seen all of this before. Trying to find out who you are, where your going in life but the added twist of trying to figure out Pat's gender throughout the whole movie is a great thing. If Pat wasn't enough you are also trying to figure out the gender of Pats love interest and how exactly they have sex. My mind is full of interesting details on how that is done. My recurring thought is that they both have male and female genitalia and they stick them in their own holes. The gender confusing one liners are a lot of fun. The plot gets a 8/10

Actor/Actresses

Julia Sweeney does a great job at playing the gender bender character who struggles at finding the perfect job and mate for him/herself. She truly does carry the movie with some slapstick comedy and gender queer antics. Dave Foley plays Pat's counter part and that relationship makes trying to find out Pats gender all the more confusing. The best line is ""I love to stroke your pussy pat"". Charles Rocket does a great job at playing Kyle. Pats obsessed neighbor who will stop at nothing to find out the gender of this intriguing person. I use to be obsessed with people and look how I turned out. (I'm pretty much a stalker with people now). He is another character that carries the movie. It's interesting what happens to him at the end of the movie. So don't get lazy and not watch the credits. The people in the movie were convincing but not the greatest. I give their acting ability a 7/10.

DVD Extras

This movie comes from Walt Disney video. Unfortunately for this one there are no special features. People need to learn that there are viewers that want to see commentaries, interviews, deleted scenes, etc. I give this a 0/10

Personal Thoughts
This movie isn't going to win academy awards or be a bestseller but it is a great movie to chuckle at and argue with your friends at what sex Pat really is. Again, it's a shame that there weren't any interviews because I think they would have been hilarious since it seemed like they had a good time making the film.

It's Pat gives us a taste at what it would be like to be a gender queer person living an everyday life and it's something that I haven't seen in a movie in awhile. This movie gets a 15/30.",1265673600,,2620,4.419087136929461
1850473,2,B00008L3TW,"The movie was bizarre, but we found humor in it. I enjoyed watching the skits on SNL, but the movie was a little too much.",1260230400,2,122,3.92
1850492,4,B00008L3TW,"What can I say about ""It's Pat""?  Well, while indeed you never find out which gender Pat belongs to, and yes, there are some parts of the movie that are just plain out stupid, overall I'd say that it is a good movie well worth purchasing.  Now I won't lie to you, it can be a bit disturbing to see; in fact some parts of the film just make me cringe with disgust, though at the same time I'm laughing.  If anything, it represents a time gone by when you can portray something as gross & weird as a person with no specific gender and it still be somewhat tasteful (I mean, come on, it could've been a lot worse!)  If you're looking for a movie that'll change your life (in one way or another), this is the one!  It's a good movie, and though a little weird, I think it should one day become an American classic.",1221523200,,810,4.10126582278481
1850493,5,B00008L3TW,"This movie is funny, funny, FUNNY!!!

Favorite moment:
Pat trips while going to her/his gig with Ween (tuba in hand).  Pat's glasses fall off and make a cheap plastic sound as they slide across the pavement.  (Play this moment over and over and you will laugh till your stomach splits.)

I saw it on TV a while back. I admit to being sucked into the mystery of Pat's gender. However, as soon as I googled it and found out that the truth was never revealed, I immediately turned the film off. There was no other incentive for me to keep watching.

The so-called ""evolved"" humour is nothing more than one lame joke. I actually cringed quite frequently at some of the gags, which were very immature and not funny in the least.

This film may appeal to adolescent males and permanent frat boys, but no one else. For anyone looking for a intellectually stimulating film, I would certainly not reccomend this one.",1141430400,3,750,4.45985401459854

1850498,5,B00008L3TW,"I find it interesting that some people don't feel this movie is worth watching even once; A few months ago I happened across it while lazily browsing the comedy section of Blockbuster, and I instantly remembered how my cousins and I used to watch it repeatedly for a several-month period about eight years ago. We thought it was hilarious, and we used to go around imitating Pat's annoying little giggle and quoting various lines. To see whether my apprieciation of this movie had had everything to do with my young age and nothing else, I rented it again and watched it with a friend. Not only do I still find it JUST as entertaining as I did at ten, but my friend loved it too.

Kyle, the obsessive neighbor who falls in love with the enigma of Pat and makes it his life purpose to find out Pat's gender, is really well played, and even a little creepy in the midst of all the comedy. Dave Foley's portrayal as Pat's...equally androgynous love interest Chris [well in truth, he looks more like a woman as this character], and the appearance of Ween [who rock, IMO] are just a few reasons I love this movie. I'm even able to feel sorry for Kathy Griffin, who plays a neighbor whom Pat won't leave alone.

While I think this film is a comedic gem, I'm not all that surprised that most people seem to feel differently. I'm not always agreed with when I mention the farcical brilliance of shows such as The Kids In The Hall and Strangers With Candy, both of which I LOVE for the way they go almost too far with the ridiculous strangeness of a situation or character.

All in all, yes, It's Pat! is incredibly stupid...And that's the POINT!! Laugh at the intended stupidity, because that's what it's there for.",1094688000,31,1707,4.482315112540193
