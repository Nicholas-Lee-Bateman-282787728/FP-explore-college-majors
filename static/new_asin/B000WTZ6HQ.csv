8225535,5,B000WTZ6HQ,"Simple clear instructions. From head to toe and front to back acupressure points.  This would not be for advanced study but I think a good place to start. The instructions on this DVD are for applying the procedure to someone else, that is what I was looking for.  I am happy with the presentation and the level of information.",1461542400,3,327,4.52542372881356
8225536,5,B000WTZ6HQ,"Excellent Video, Gave me some really nice pointers on accupressure. Some of these excercises you can do on your own self.",1402531200,2,121,4.809523809523809
8225537,5,B000WTZ6HQ,"This video is just under an hour and is well done.  The segments are layed out into body sequences that are very easy to follow.  Obviously, by the title, this is not an depth study of point work however it is done with the practitioner in mind and anyone who does massage, energy work or the like will be able to use these sequences immediately in their practice.  Even novices will be able to pick this up very easily.

Overall 5 stars, for quality and ease of use.

8225538,5,B000WTZ6HQ,"This is a professionally done video, good quality.  The presenter is very good, easy to listen to, and the acupressure sequences are easy to see.  I used this video with my students and had them follow along and perform the acupressure session.  It was well-paced for this--just what I was looking for.",1213488000,11,302,4.769230769230769
