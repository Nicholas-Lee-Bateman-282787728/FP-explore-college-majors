8503126,3,B006QS4EWA,"This training video has a lot of really good training tips, techniques and advice.  However, it is not your typical training video that you would follow and work out with.  It is more of just an instructional video that teaches you moves, then leaves you on your own to work out.  I wish the description indicated this, as I thought I was getting a workout video to follow.  The information is excellent, but if looking for a pop in video to follow along, this is not it.",1365638400,,471,4.379310344827586
