8387110,2,B0031O7V0E,"I got this blu-ray mainly for Schumann's Piano Concerto. This concerto, along with Grieg's, is extremely enjoyable if the performance is inspired. Otherwise they become very mundane pieces. Unfortunately neither the soloist nor the orchestra can be said offering an inspired performance. I gave two stars for some of the better performed orchestral pieces Chailly puts out here. The video pickings are very slim for both Schumann and Grieg concerti. Hope someone make a good blu-ray for these pieces.",1502755200,,500,5.341772151898734

8387112,5,B0031O7V0E,"I had to give the 5-star rating some thought but finally decided this is a great addition to my colllection of DVD/Blue Ray concert performances. I initially ""nit-picked"" some production issues, and I'll discuss them later herein, but overall, they really don't detract from a completely satisfying performance.

This is a production full of notable and noteworthy performers:  The Gewandaus Orchestra (founded in 1743, Felix Mendelsohn Bartholdy first director/conductor, premiered works by Schumann, Schubert, Wagner, Brahms, and many others); Ricardo Chailly (became assistant condutor to Claudio Abbado at la Scala at age 20, becoming a word-class conductor/music director in the ensuing years with a very impressive catalog of recordings, DVDs and Blue Rays of some truly monumental music); and Martha Argerich, the pianist many musicians and music lovers believe to the the greatest pianist of the late 20th Century.  And no one lets the listener/watcher down.  This is a fine Schumann performance all around.

The concert starts with Tchaikovsky's arrangement and orchestration of ""Adagio & Allegro Brilliante"" from ""Etudes Symphoniques, Op. 13"".  The performance  is very good and Chailly immediately shows an ability to bring out the core of the music - and some beautiful playing by the orchestras winds.  This is by no means a major work, and it was not originally written for an orchestra; but it works and turned out to be a good starter for this all-Schumann concert.

Next is Schumann's ""Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in A minor, Op. 54"".  Argerich does not rush her way through the concerto and shows incredible insight and highlights subtle nuances commonly passed over by more aggressive performers - but there's no reason to rush when you hear phrases handled with such finesse and delicacy.  Argerich saves the thunder for where it's needed, generally accentuating the romantic aspects of this wonderfu piece.  Her encore (after four curtain calls) is ""Of Foreign Lands and Peoples"" from ""Kinderszenen, Op. 15"", and it is spellbinding.  The audience clearly appeared to want more - so did I!

Frankly, Ravel's arrangement of ""4 Pieces from Carnival, Op. 9"", could have been left out - not because it wasn't played quite well, but because after hearing Argerich's incredible performance of the piano conceerto, I felt the"" Fourth Symphony in D minor, Op. 120"" would have been enough for one sitting.  This was a terrific performance.  Chailly took his time and allowed the climaxes to develop without any unnecessary pushing, and this orchestra's history with Schumann showed they knew what they were doing.  Don't get me wrong, there was no shortage of romantic angst in the outer movements, but I never got the feeling anyone was rushing to get to the end.  I liked this performance.  In my short acreer as an orchestral clarinetist, this was one part of the standard repertoire I truly enjoyed playing every time.  This perfomance brought back some very pleasant memories.

And I truly enjoyed the whole concert.  It's a lot of Schumann for one sitting, but I never got tired or wished it would end.  Argerich could have done 10 encores and I would have been glued to my seat.  The recorded sound could have been a little less bass-heavy and some of the camera work could have been finessed a bit, but overall, this Blue Ray was well worth the investment and will be one I'll return to frequently.  Anytime Martha Argerich plays, people show up to witness her magic - I even saw a man who I swear was Mercedes-Benz's CEO, DieterZetsche (or his body double) in the audience!  And it appeared the audience really enjoyed it too.  While I feel some production values could be a bit better, there's nothing about what you see on the screen or hear from the very good surround sound audio to detract from a terrific perfomance.  I'm happy to have this disc in my collection.",1427414400,,3894,5.004658385093168

8387115,4,B0031O7V0E,"This concert is intended to mark the 150th anniversary of Schumann's death. It features two key works, the piano concerto and the 4th Symphony, plus orchestral re-workings of Schumann's piano pieces by Tchaikovsky and Ravel.

The concerto is closely associated with Martha Argerich who has made this into a major part of her core repertoire and who has a well-regarded CD recording to her credit. On this occasion she produces a very free-flowing version of the concerto both in rhythmical and phrasing terms. The very opening bars will prepare the listener by being almost improvisatory in their approach. There will be those who would prefer a stricter interpretation in these ways but this version offers an enhanced sense of Romantic flexibility and zeal. This is therefore a notable performance of striking character.

The Symphony performance is not quite at this consistent level with rather a staid reading of the first movement which, arguably, lacks sufficient fire or sparkle to be described as a compulsive listening experience. From there on things though improve considerably with an attractive second movement and violin solo, a bright and tight scherzo and a finale that finally lifts to the conclusion.

The remaining items of this concert are orchestrations of Schumann's piano music by Tchaikovsky and Ravel as mentioned above and which, rather sadly, only illustrate that Schumann knew better. The original piano versions have far more bite and internal clarity. These orchestrations, despite their varied orchestral colours, simply rob the originals of their essential vitality.

This remains a well-recorded disc with crisp imaging, truthful colours and sympathetic camera work by the ever-reliable Paul Smaczny team. The sound is full ranging and is presented in PCM 5.1 and stereo.

This is an enjoyable concert overall with a mixture of the inspirational and the good but with provisos for program content. Those who are interested in good DVD / Bluray versions of the four symphonies would do well to consider the consistently fine set conducted by Paavo Jarvi on the C Major label. Those primarily interested in the concerto might well be very content with this disc as Argerichs performance is the best yet in these formats.",1345248000,,2252,5.2444444444444445
8387116,5,B0031O7V0E,"The Schumann piano concerto played by Martha Argerich flows in her hands. It is as if one has heard it for the first time. I thought I knew the piece until I heard and saw her playing in this 2006 performance of the piece. Chailly and the gewandhausorchestra Leipzig accompany her with flair. It is as though they were as one. She gives an encore Von fremden Landern und Menschen, in response to the raptuous applause for her playing of the Piano concerto. The Symphony No 4 is swift and played as it should be.  The  orchestra pieces Adagio and Allegro brillante arr Tchaikovsky, and four pieces from carnaval arr Ravel are forgettable.",1323907200,2,637,4.628318584070796
8387117,5,B0031O7V0E,"The excellent five-star review by Scott Morrison can't be bettered, so I'll just aim to supplement it with some additional perspective.

First, I honestly believe live performances like these are what Blu-ray was meant to capture. If you have a flat-screen TV and a surround-sound setup (however inexpensive), Blu-ray provides a ""you are there"" quality at home that simply was not possible before the format entered the scene.

The visuals are ultra-sharp, the sound fidelity is amazing, and the well-chosen close-ups elevate the experience beyond what you would have had in the symphony hall. In this case, you get to see Martha Argerich's delicate fingerwork and her enjoyment of the musical conversation with the orchestra. With Riccardo Chailly, you feel his intense involvement, conveyed at times through rather crazy-eyed facial expressions as the music builds. It all adds to the excitement and makes for a fully satisfying experience.

But what's impressing me the most about the Blu-rays being released is the unexpected quality of the performances themselves. I've listened to historical recordings for many years, so I arrive at each new performance with the bar set very high, and therefore I'm often left wanting. Perhaps you've felt the same. Not so with the classical live-performance Blu-rays released by companies like this one (EuroArts). So many are absolutely top rank.

That's the case here. I've heard the Schumann piano concerto many, many times -- as likely you have -- but this is the performance I'll be coming back to. And the Schumann 4th became a favorite of mine after I experienced it live a quarter century ago with the Concertgebouw Orchestra under Bernard Haitink. I still remember it as one of the most thrilling times I've had in the concert hall. In the years afterward, it's been difficult to find a performance that measured up (and, disappointingly and surprisingly, the studio recording Haitink did with the orchestra was entirely unexciting). But this one does. Again, it's the one I'll be coming back to.

The other Schumann works on this disc (arranged by Tchaikovsky and Ravel) were new to me, and I must admit I have no plans to relisten to them. But for those who favor them, they're a nice bonus.",1298764800,12,2244,5.054054054054054
8387118,5,B0031O7V0E,"First, the contents, in order as they appear of this all-Schumann DVD, not yet listed by Amazon:

Adagio & Allegro brillante (arr. Tchaikovsky)
Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54, with Martha Argerich, piano
'Von fremden Lndern und Menschen' (encore, Argerich)
Four Pieces from 'Carnaval' (arr. Maurice Ravel)
Symphony No. 4 in D minor, Op. 120
with Riccardo Chailly, Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra

This is undoubtedly Argerich's show. The dressy audience in the Gewandhaus give her a thunderous ovation after the concerto and equally after her tiny encore ('Of foreign lands and people' from 'Kinderszenen.') Surely Argerich is the reigning diva of international pianists and she does not disappoint here. The concerto is brilliant as one would expect, but there is a lyrical geniality in her playing, too, which seems to be something relatively new for her. Time was when she could be counted primarily for pianistic fireworks; now there are fireworks but also a singing line that makes one's heart swell. She uses divided hands as always -- with the right hand often coming in subtly a micro-beat after the left, typical of old style pianists but not so often heard these days -- and her phrasing, with its agogics and rubato so delicately and unerringly applied, makes the music come alive. This is a marvelous traversal of this time-honored concerto. She makes the most of the rhythmic complexities, particularly those in the third movement, and the music comes out seeming fresher and more modern than it typically does. Still, Schumannesque gemtlichheit is in satisfying abundance. One is reminded again how Schumann used Beethoven as his model, with the short second movement leading without break in the finale (as Beethoven did in his Fourth Concerto) and the opening movement's main theme acting as the bridge into the finale, as is the case with Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. But Schumann's fingerprints are unmistakable throughout. For instance, the finale is in a graceful but energetic triple time that in the middle section alters accents so that it sounds as if in duple time, a place where conductors and orchestras famously come to grief (as Mendelssohn did in the concerto's premiere). It creates no problems here for Chailly and the Gewandhaus; indeed, this is a breathtaking wind-up to this so-familiar concerto. If I had to characterize this performance in one word, and it surprises me to do so if only because I'm comparing it with Argerich's previous CD recording with Harnoncourt, it would be 'sunny.' A lovely performance, worth having.

The concert opens with an arrangement by Tchaikovsky of the Adagio and the Allegro brillante from Schumann's solo piano work, 'tudes symphoniques.' I'd never heard it before. While one can admire Tchaikovsky's skill as an orchestrator (and at times it does indeed sound like Tchaikovsky rather than Schumann) it also reminds one of how Tchaikovsky's own music sometimes owes something to Schumann. The Gewandhausorchester sounds rich and full here.

After Argerich's hushed encore, greeted with equally hushed but intense appreciation by the audence, another orchestration of Schumann piano music pops up, that by Ravel of four pieces from 'Carnaval' (listed as 1. Prambule. Quasi maestoso - Pi moto - Animato - Vivo - Presto; 2. Valse allemande. Molto vivace; 3. Intermezzo. Paganini. Presto; 4. Marche des 'Davidsbndler' contre les Philistins. Non allego - Molto pi vivo - Animato - Vivo - Animato moto - Vivo - Pi stretto). Again, I had never heard these orchestrations before. Having myself played 'Carnaval' at the piano, I had some difficulty making the switch to the orchestral timbres, but once I did I realized what a creative and apt job Ravel made of his orchestration. This should come as no surprise as he was one of the twentieth century's master orchestrators. Chailly is in tune with the lightning fast tempo and mood changes in this so-Romantic collection of character pieces.

Schumann's Fourth Symphony, written in 1841, was actually his second to be written but since he made revisions in 1851, after the Second and Third had been premiered, it has since been listed as the last of his symphonies. Brahms had the 1841 version published in the 1890s but it is the 1851 version we hear here. This symphony can have muddy textures if not lightened up either by very careful orchestral voicing or by re-orchestration (most famously done by Mahler). I am fairly sure this is the original orchestration, but the performance does not suffer from clotted textures as performed here. The work begins with one of Schumann's subtlest masterstrokes -- a five-octave A that begins on beat 3 of a 3/4 measure and then is held for three further measures. Its beginning on the last beat of a measure, which the listener without a score will not perceive as such, sets up a subtle uncertainty when one finally hears a downbeat. Schumann, of the composers of his time, had an almost unique ability to set up a slightly tense anticipation in the listener with the minutest of means. It is touches like this that mark out the genius composer.

Since coming to the Gewandhaus only a couple of years ago, Chailly has taken the orchestra into more refined regions of playing. They were a mini-Berlin Philharmonic, very Germanic if a bit leaner, under Masur, and were somewhat Americanized under Blomstedt. Under Chailly they seem to be coming into their own and it is a blessing that we are now getting numbers of CDs and, importantly, DVDs of the group. Also, they seem to have more and more younger players and this appears to be all to the good. Brass are particularly good, tending to be much more subtle than anything heard in the past. The string sound has been richened. Indeed, I find no weak sections in the orchestra and am heartened by that.

This is from a live concert that occurred only four months before the DVD was issued! And in the 1981 Gewandhaus -- the third in a series of concert halls with the name -- with its marvelous architecture and fine acoustics. Sound is state-of-the art and available in PCM Stereo, DD 5.1 or DTS 5.1. Videography is crystal clear and focuses, often in closeup, primarily on the musicians (always a plus for me) but there is plenty of opportunity to observe both Argerich and Chailly.

This DVD is a keeper.
