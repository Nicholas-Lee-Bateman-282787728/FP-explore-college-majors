6287033,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"Terry Gilliam appears to have made a parody of his previous films.  It's essentially Brazil meets Doctor Parnassus with the underlying theme of Waiting for Godot.  You know that Qohen Leth is not going to find what he's looking for in the real world, anymore than Gilliam's past characters, but there is something oddly comic about his character that makes it all seem like one big joke.  Christoph Waltz is excellent as Q, keeping this film afloat when it looked like it would sink under its own weight at times.  Melanie Thierry makes for a fetching muse as Bainsley and Tilda Swinton provides much comic relief as Dr. Shrink-Rom.  The real surprise is Lucas Hedges as Bob, a teenager programmer who seems to be the only one who really knows what's going on.

Q struggles with a theorem, which if proven true would mean all our lives add up to a big fat zero.  He can't quite bring himself to accept that, especially when he finds himself drawn to Bainsley's sultry charms.  Matt Damon as the ""Management"" appears to be channeling Karl Lagerfeld in this movie with his shock of white hair and his tight-fitting suits that literally have him blending into the wallpaper.  He is more cynical than sinister, using others to prove his point that life is meaningless.  He picks Q because he still has faith, waiting on a phone call that will provide him escape from the chaos swirling around him.  Unlike Brazil, there seems more an element of free will in this movie but predictably Q chooses not to take it.  Instead, he obsesses over the impossible equation, falling into the same trap as others before him, or in this case a black hole.

Zero Theorem is more about the folly in searching for meaning in life, resulting in missed opportunities when they present themselves.  None of this is meant to be taken seriously, and that's a good thing.",1408838400,4,1844,4.6687306501547985
6287034,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"How can you not love a film that has ""Church of Batman the Redeemer"" on a billboard within the first 5 minutes? This film is an experience with timeless themes explored in ways that leave you wondering. Don't look for a plot or a meaning that is easily verifiable here--this is exactly what film does best: it creates a mood and drives the viewer through it. Well worth your time if you enjoy the art of film especially the hybrid fantasy genre this one seems to create. The acting is splendid and fluid, and the visual effects are stunning.",1408838400,24,541,4.474747474747475
6287035,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"This movie has some Brazil-like themes, but is also quite different.  For one, Brazil has a tragically dark ending that invites the viewer to find a way to deny it.  This is possible because some scenes are clearly imaginary or full of cognitive dissonance, yet there seems to be no escape.  Zero Theorem has similar elements, but any sense of ultimate darkness is denied (by a voiceover in the credits).  The viewer is free to be satisfied or dis-satisfied.  But the same enticement to understand is undeniable, a mark of great art.  You cannot forget this movie.  Also special is the junction of main characters that each quite obviously live in different worlds, though part of the same world.  Their perspectives are not just different, they are otherworldly different.  Yet they coexist, tolerating dialogs that contain interleaved sense and nonsense.  The sets, visuals, and cinematography are also excellent.",1408752000,89,915,5.121621621621622
6287036,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"I kept wanting this movie to turn into an adaptation of Transmetropolitan because visually they feel similar and Christoph Waltz could easily play Spider Jerusalem - I'd love to see him stomp around dressed as an angry Jesus from issue #6, God Riding Shotgun.

Anyway, this is not that movie. What this movie is the exploration of a social phobic (Waltz) who has lost all feeling and joy in his life and everything he does has lost any meaning to him. He works feverishly at something he doesn't care about, he eats food only as sustenance and not for taste (tap water and oatmeal), and he has no human relations. His only hope is to get a phone call from God and he lives in a rundown old crumbling church that is, a bit on the nose, metaphorical for his delusional religious belief. His only dream is staring over the event horizon of a black hole.

The film, I believe, is not to be taken literally at all. We see the world through his distorted lens. In fact the bizarre, very Terry Gilliam sets, odd camera angles, and crazed imagined future works to put us in this lonely and sick man's head. Most of the characters probably do not even exist outside of his own mind - the boy is probably a version of himself when he was younger, Management is probably is paranoid vision of his boss and of God, the girl is his return to sexual fantasy through virtual stimulation but is actually just an impersonal avatar (porn fantasy), his boss is the only real person who probably does care a little about him, and the bizarre other characters, such as the two clones, are probably how he sees other human beings: they don't *actually look like that, but they seem to to him.

Trouble is, what does it all mean and what's it all for?

He's been tasked by Management to prove nothing exists and that the universe is a pointless waste of time. He puts all his effort into this proof, but over the course of the film ""meets"" some new people and even starts to find a little joy in life, and then burns out. He doesn't actually believe in what he's trying to prove but by the end ...

And here's the problem, by the end it all sort of goes nowhere. Yes, nothing may be nothing and the universe may be pointless, but Gilliam could have told us that by not making this movie. Our time is sort of wasted here.

What I do think is interesting, however, is that this vision of the world is really a way for Gilliam to make sense of the world he lives in. Gilliam is a 73 year old man and though an artist, he's probably not ""hip"" to the world of computers and smartphones and the internet. Sure, he may use all those gadgets but they are not a part of his life the way they would be for someone younger, such as Spike Jonze. Gilliam seems to see this technology as a bad thing and as a waste of time and as something making us more distant from each other. Spike Jonze, however, in his film ""Her"" has a more pragmatic point of view on the issue of connecting to other through technology. He doesn't see it as silly or pornographic or, as The Zero Theorem hints at, sinful (all that religious symbolism is not there by chance).

Yet Gilliam's vision is not invalid, either. We should take his point of view seriously because we, too will be in his shoes one day. We will wake up as old men and women and look at the world around us and think it has gone mad and that everything all the young people are doing is a terrible waste and maybe even sinful. And we'll wonder what the whole point of the universe is or was and why we even bothered existing in the first place in this crazed future we no longer really understand or take joy in.

Gilliam's film is that of an older generation trying to make sense of a younger one. Even harder is that Gilliam was such a vital part of his own younger generation - so much, in fact, that his previous work is still highly influential - that you can almost feel the desperation of Gilliam wanting to reconnect with that vitality and relevance. And in this way the film is rather brilliant because it's about Gilliam the old man who desperately wants to be part of the younger world: the world of Spike Jonze and his film ""Her"".

And so even the nothing ending of The Zero Theorem, as mildly frustrating as it is, makes sense from Gilliam's point of view. The universe for this old man is all rather pointless because it has passed him by and all he can hope for is to take advantage of the few pieces he can make work (the virtual reality beach setting) and spend his days naked in the surf like an infant playing with a giant beach-ball. In other words, he's irrelevant and he knows it so why bother.",1408665600,23,4626,4.30195177956372
6287037,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"The movie keeps you wondering, and that's what it is about. It is a meaningful dialogue between the director and viewer, sort of like they used to make movies.

6287040,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"Ever since FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, Gilliam's work lost some of its verve, and we've been hit with a string of lackluster entries that only sporadically capture the director's penchant for manic brilliance. THE ZERO THEOREM does not restore the director to his classic days, but it is nevertheless a surprisingly coherent, moving film, one of the director's most transparently philosophical efforts.",1408579200,3,406,5.359375
6287041,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"In an overpopulated, ultra-technological future, there is an isolated and idiosyncratic computer virtuoso who refers to himself in the plural (""We are dying,"" he sadly intones) and awaits a telephone call he believes will reveal the purpose of his existence.  Employed by a vast corporation, he receives an absurd, complicated, and perhaps dangerous assignment:  prove zero equals one-hundred percent, which is to say prove the universe, despite its complexity, has no overarching purpose.  Part of his troubled mind rebels against the idea, devoid as it is of design and hope, even as he hides in his home--an old, burned, cobweb-and-shadow-enshrouded church--and devotes his days and nights to proving it.  The Zero Theorem is latest feature by visionary director Terry Gilliam, whose many legendary films include Time Bandits, Brazil, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

This plays as a companion piece to Brazil in particular:  a more intimate, but still very amusing and highly thoughtful continuation of the 1985 film's anxious themes (a flawed, but hopeful man against an overbearing and soul-crushing surveillance state) and elaborate humans-in-a-pinball-machine set pieces, complete with vivid pop-art colors and acrobatic camera movements.  Gilliam proves he still has the X factor which has always set him apart (as a stylist, as a social critic, as a comic, as a cinematic madman).  He has an invaluable partner here in star Christoph Waltz, who has become one of the most unusual and riveting actors on the A list after dual Academy Awards for performances in Quentin Tarantino films.  Bald, curved, neurotic, retreating from others, and racing to and fro in his environments as if even his bed were an inhospitable place, Waltz vanishes headlong into his role, creating a character peculiar beyond compare, yet easy to champion as he searches the expansive void for elusive answers which may not even exist.",1408579200,233,1922,5.296052631578948

The opening scene is probably one of the best in the movie, doing a great job setting the tone as gritty techno-future, but not taking itself too seriously.

And in the same way that, what we normally call, fairy tales help children learn, grow, and think, we are led along the more mature versions of those acts; to re-evaluate, evolve, and transcend. Sure he has been a source of belly laughs (remember the very instant you realized the knights horses were being simulated by coconut shells) but many more times he has been inspirational and a source of strength... Maybe the ridiculously insane things we all daydream, maybe the leftist view of life MOST of us share, that is to say, seeing the absurdity of this dilettantish world, the one that really exists, with all its 'money to be made' premise... well, just that it isn't cause to go insane; because there are others out there who see it like we do... for the load of horse manure it pretty much is. Terry's visions are absurd; true, but the world is so twisted that it isn't hard to squint, just a little, and achieve suspension of disbelief... scary and sad as that is.",1495411200,,1063,4.62962962962963

But it's not for the escapist that's for sure, some people should just stick to star wars and terminator.  That being said, the plot is not really why you watch this movie, it's more like a museum of art, you go for the scenes, the moods, the moments.  It would have been nice if it came together into something deeper, but it didn't need to in order to be entertaining.

Darkly humorous and subtly grave, Christoph Waltz's performance alone makes this film worth watching.  While there's a plot to the film from one perdpective, it serms like more of a device to provide insight into the characters and their vastly differing motivations-- and the irony that there are differing motivations, considering the questions the film raises.  Hitting on some of the questons raised in his other films, and wishing I were astute enough to understand the links, it seems to me that there are several common visual elements and themes that it has in common with Brazil and Twelve Monkeys and if you liked those films, chances are you'll enjoy this one as well; if you didn't, or aren't wanting to watch a film that requires a bit of viewer engagement to appreciate, it's probably not a great choice.",1484524800,,1073,4.917127071823204

It will be difficult for those not familiar with Mr. Gilliam's body of work to get their heads around ""why"" this movie is what it is.

At first glance I did not expect much, but after the first five minutes I had stopped what I was doing and actually paying attention to what I had on instead of multitasking. It almost has a Fifth Element meets Rain Man meets Good Will Hunting/K-PAX vibe to it. It is unique to say the least.

I had watched this film two times thinking the ending was somewhat depresssing (each time I found more acting depth are artistry in what may seem like a boring/weird film to many) but once I watched the third time I believe I could see a few possible outcomes that wouldn't leave the viewer letdown. If you watch this movie, then make sure you pay attention during the credits at the very end and turn up the volume.

6287111,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"Ludicrous nihilism that goes nowhere? NOT!  The Zero Theorem is light-hearted AND points the way to meaning.  What is there to enjoy?

1. The main character  -- I could identify with his alienation and insignificance. This is a common experience, however uncomfortable it may be to see it so boldly drawn.

2. The culture had become insanely nihilistic, yes, but the main character knows it.  He knows it. To know the truth is in itself is freeing.  More importantly, to the very end he will not settle.  For him to take such a stance felt deeply, powerfully optimism, and heroic.

3.  Though he was unhappy, everyone else was happy, cheerful, or seemingly content.... bright delightful costumes, active, engaged.  This alone was fun to watch.  This combined with a character who knows better is effective.

4.  Q's name is a version of the name for the seeker of Ecclesiastes in the Bible, who has concluded that vanity of vanity, all is vanity.  I thought this was effectively rendered by the movie.

5.  I took seriously the religious symbolism perverted by a culture that had utterly forgotten or de-mythologized all that was meaningful and valuable in its tradition.  In other words, the movie for those who have eyes to see, pointed the way to the buried treasure of Christ.  Here he was -- still on the cross -- decapitated by surveillance machinery -- but still on the cross, suffering with Q, and a direct answer to the ailments of the culture.

6.  Spoiler alert:  The ending seemed an act of faith to me. A perfect ending. In a world that has lost it's deepest values and meaning, Q choose the best he could:  He realized his new girl friend did not understand and that he would have to go it alone.  He chose to live in a dilapidated church -- perhaps because it was close to something he longed for.

He finally fully owns his inner longing symbolized by the swirling emptiness of the galaxies, and he let's himself fall into this beautiful swirl of the universe as a child would -- in faith and trust that it's all good.",1475020800,,2034,4.614525139664805

Christoph Waltz affirms his acting stature with another amazing performance as Qohen (""pronounced Cohen, not Quinn"") that needs to be seen to be appreciated. David Thewlis is perfectly cast as the supervisor as is Melanie Thierry as Bainsley who's performance ends up being especially touching.

At first sight I expected Lucas Hedges character to be like Seth Green's in the Austin Powers movies. To the contrary, his character Bob perfectly portrays the dilemmas that would face a teen-ager with exceptional intellect and abilities. While the world and his father, Management played by Matt Damon in a miscast semi-cameo, expects him to use his abilities ""for the greater good"", Bob still wants to experience being a teen-ager. He wants to run around and do what he wants, eat pizza, and experience his first love.

This movie certainly won't suit everyone's taste. As sci-fi fan and STEM geek who loves quirky stories, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Anyone who enjoys films as an art form should see this for the sets, scenery, costumes, and CGI locations.

Waltz plays a computer programmer trying to figure out the zero theorem, and the work he does is represented so artfully.  It's not a bunch of typing codes - it has become more of a video game.

6287217,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"It is slow and yeah very little actually happens, but the movie is entirely paced for character development which it does in spades.  It is hard to review without specifically pointing out the ending or key scenes, but if you don't rush it, keep your eyes and brain open, and don't expect a classic view where the protagonist had all the right answers and spends the movie/conflict being vindicated/proven right against all the odds, then the ending is amazing and isn't a twist, it fits right where it should after the plot the movie took.

I keep hearing this movie get compared to Melancholia because they are both low on events & heavy on philosophy, but the difference in my opinion is that Melancholia was about wasps who were sad they didn't ever connect with each other and resolve this by continuing to not connect with each other, but there was no meaningful dialog, there was no character growth, no real point for the movie to exist, it served and did nothing, this is not a good comparison.  A better one would be City of Lost Children or Brazil, a slow movie that is not for everyone, very focused on being both pretty and disturbing stylistically, but every scene is one or more characters developing and building a larger picture.  Where it may not be for everyone, but the people it is for will absolutely love it.",1466899200,2,1331,4.60337552742616

6287260,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"5 Stars because I found this refreshing as far as the movement, busyness of the environment, and the great acting the cast did to give this director have a chance to get this story to work. Lots of color and activity as the storyline moves along. You have a main character that you discover has an issue that you do not quite follow/understand at the very beginning. It takes a bit for you to assemble what is going on. A corporate leader (who is the master of all who work for him) is focused to solve his one business problem (at the moment) being the Zero Theorem so he can exploit/manipulate all his customers, but he still needs the answer 1st.
The three supporting actors introduced do a great job of being involved with the main character. Each delivering the key instigators manipulation in a different way, two discovering something about themselves from that experience, one modifying a device that in the end, will give the main character an opportunity to either find his answer, create his own from what he learned from a supporting actor, or be stuck elsewhere. Everyone is under the same thumb as this employee, everyone and everything is manipulated and the manipulated are manipulating the main character.
Each supporting character has needs andthose needs are made public by the end, and it seems the main character brought this about. I enjoyed the movie and you need to relate things and follow them to get to the end. It is deep but (as far as I am concerned) not boring. As others have mentioned, the end does seem to come about without a clear resolve to everything that has happened. You do ask yourself, What happened? once or twice, maybe even What is going on?, but the acting, the imagery and the sound all play a part in how you see and understand the end of the whole movie. Listen for a voice at the end, remember an earlier scene where that voice came from, what did that voice tell the main character the 1st time they met, where were they? Then, you will understand how the main character comes to resolve of his question and peace of mind. A supporting actor manipulated something and wanted him to try it. That same actor sort of went our with the main character for a walk. Was that a good by have a nice trip moment with some sincerity? Put it all together and then you may see if the main character found what he was looking for. Deep, and I think worth my time. Thank you",1464912000,2,2411,4.494305239179955

I especially like the ending as ambiguous as it is.  The stars are there, the production values are there and the only reason this film didn't become a summer smash is because the idiots in charge of the promotion budget decided to fling it at some POS tent pole production instead.

6287333,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"It's better than Brazil if you're comparing. In fact, it's only like Brazil in that it's a human story of alienation taking place in a vague future. It's more like if Terry Gilliam and Paul Verhoeven combined their powers and made something gloriously absurd and relevant. I men that in the most respectful way. Gilliam has leveled up as a director and the world he shows us is an uncanny caricature of the future we face. This movie is darkly funny. It throws away more good jokes than many comedies can muster. In addition, it is terrifying and tragic in a cosmic, existential way.

The glue that keeps it together is great performance and dialogue. The constant cycle of characters through Q's world of angst could get tiresome, but there's an immediacy and humanity to all of the encounters. Everyone is engaging in a bare way that never ceases to be captivating. This keeps the story driving forward to the turns and philosophical insights.

But don't worry, every moment is filled with at least a dozen things that seem meaningful and beautiful. That to me is the meta insight. In a life without inherent meaning or hope for an afterlife, we have to find and experience the meaningful art of the here-and-now. This is worth your time.",1461542400,2,1240,4.709677419354839

I wouldn't say that this is Gilliam's best  effort, it is not as rich as his other films, but the commentary on contemporary society is just as sharp and pointed. This is not a film for those of short attention span or those looking for the bland tale of Star Wars or the triteness of Mad Max, Gilliam always makes you think and will and can make you uncomfortable, but that is the duty of an artist.",1461369600,,763,4.2620689655172415

I LOVED 12 Monkeys (just watched it) and didn't know that this Zero Theorem movie was directed by Terry. I immediately set this on my movie watch queue.

I have no idea how to explain this movie, and that's why I love it in this weird paradoxical way.

I guess the lower star reviews or for people that don't like philosophical themes or tones, but if you are into ""that stuff"" then I definitely suggest this film for you. I usually never write reviews but I was so blown away by this strange, yet engaging film, that I just had to stand up for the movie!

Philosophical ideas can get pretty boring to explain, yet I was engaged during the whole run-time. It is just so weird and strange that it kept my interest. Therein lies the beauty of the movie. Again, I am biased towards these kind of existential weird themes in movies, music, art etc.

This flick isn't suppose to make you comfortable. It isn't suppose to be cookie cutter. It makes you question s***. It makes you wonder. It makes you awe. That is why I LOVE IT!

I hope after this review with my FIVE (5) STARS that this can bump up the average even a little bit.

Granted, I get why some people would be turned off by this type of film; if you were looking for some campy kick-back and relax typical film, this one isn't for you - I repeat, RUN! This is a movie for one of those introspective nights when you wonder just what the hell you are doing with your life haha.

If you want to ""go deep"" into the abyss, nay, into the black-hole past the event horizon *wink wink* I highly suggest you watch this flick and let your brain melt into its weird existential goodness. If that line I just typed makes absolutely no sense, well, you'd probably be best just turning on the TV and watching some reruns of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Ahhhhhbaaaaaazing!

Love Terry and the crew. Love this movie. I can't wait to watch his others - Brazil and Fear and Loathing.

It was not like I've expected but it was ok.
The ending seems totally like Cohen brothers' <Barton Fink> though.
The movie was like watching his previous movies all over again. It's like a mixture of his other movies, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. All together, walla! A new movie here.

The exterior is very entertainging and there are a lot of things to watch. Especially fluorescence colored graffiti and all kind of billboards that movies. People's wearings and so on. It is clearly the way future world we are looking at. They must have spent a lot of effort to creat them.
Also the interior where the main actor Christoph Waltz is living is definaltely reminds me of the movie BLADE RUNNGER. Kind of gothic old fashioned building with huge place with exotic looking computers and so on.
Also the tool that makes him connect with this hooker girl to meet her in another place which is a dream world or a fantasy world is pretty amazing.
They usually meet at the beach somewhere that looks like maybe Hawaii. The color of the scene is more unrealistic though.
There they become more friendly and relaxed. Knowing the fact that Christoph is a genious computer operator this place is the only way for him to be totally loosen himself a little.
At the end he goes there for real and stays there forever. Just like Cohen brothers' <Barton Fink>.

This movie is a mixture of his previous move <BRAZIL><TWELVE MONKEYS><FISHER KING> .
You will clearly see those movies from this one while watching it. That is another happiness.
But there is unpleasant thing too which is the storyline is not clear. It's very loosen and the ending is very much opned and going nowhere.
This is probably the most experimental movie that he ever made in terms of no exact story movie he made.

But, to say the movie is one thing when it is completely the opposite is nothing more than the reviewer (or said person of 'opinion') taking an unintended look at themselves in the ""proverbial mirror.""
And if you think about it a particular ""one word"" (1 star) critique is a simple reflection of that person.

The Zero Theorem is 'nothing' more than a great big (vicious) Circle.  Kind of a punchline in search of a theory - or theorem - itself.
""The 'Zip T' sapped the soul right outta' me...""
Be careful what you dwell on (or wish for)
But, fans of Terry Gilliam (Monty Python fame) should like this, especially, if they liked Brazil.  Very similar in theme.  Yet, they are different in mood.  ZERO is actually sillier; somewhat cartoon-ish.
Brazil is more a satire of Bureaucracies, Class, and Power.  People as 'expendable' numbers.
THE ZERO THEOREM is more about the loss of soul.  Commercialism.  Lots of technologically advanced(?) advancing commercialism.  There is a lot being sold here but at what cost?
Something very simple is missing in society; and for ""Q"" (Qohen, Christoph Waltz) in particular.
Yes it is very simple, actually, by the end of THE ZERO THEOREM the viewer has been left in a Cyber Space.  Is it real?  Is it happiness?  Is it real happiness?  Does it matter for ""Q""?

One might imagine this movie as something like a a very early, pre-studio/hollywood-intervention version of The Fifth Element before rewrites that turned the main character from loser to hero and the narrative arch from a dull dead end to a traditional, exciting adventure.

6287564,2,B00IRD8JJ6,"I am a fan of Terry Gilliams films and have seen and owned many of them. His film work tends to be very inventive and original, albeit in an often quirky kind of way. I went into this film wanting to like it and found I just could not do so. This film went way beyond strange to almost bizarre at times. My wifes reaction was even more negative. She flat didn't like it nor could develop any interest in it at all. For my part, I kept waiting to make a connection and become engaged with the plot, and just couldn't get there. This major problem is that this film reminds me more of interpretive art then a film at times. I saw this same problem with his other film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus as well. The performance of the actors, especially Dave Thewlis, is way over the top and rather disappointing, even embarrassing at times. Davids scene in the cat suit is particularly memorable in this context. The only acting bright spot in this film was the performance of Melanie Thierry. It is unfortunate that Terry seems to have lost the ability to maintain a tight focus for his film plots and tends to let the plot wander all over the place, and the actors to improvise all they want, often to the detriment of the film. I hope Terry isn't going to keep on in this style. If so, I probably will not continue viewing and purchasing his films. I am rating this film as a 2 star film and we are donating this film, as we did with the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus to our local library, since neither my wife nor I feel we will ever want to watch it again.

I see this movie as a discouraging viewpoint from an older person's perspective of the computer revolution.  It is conceived, in this movie, as a cancer on our civilization, bringing in its wake solipsism and nihilism (i.e. the zero theorem).  There are many images in the film which tend to give it an overall lack of focus.  In addition, because it is a dark vision coming from the older generation, it is not very meaningful to the young.

6287577,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"There is a zero theorem in math but it has nothing to do with the zero theorem of this movie. Here the zero theorem is an idea that leads to the end of the universe via a black whole gobbling everything up. I believe. At any rate the science here is just window dressing. What counts is the ever quirky sets and wandering story line made entertaining by some fine acting and surprising twists and revelations in the inimitable Terry Gilliam style.

I was particularly mesmerized by Mlanie Thierry who plays Bainsley, a stylish hooker with a hankering for older men (QED). She is after partially mad scientist Oohen Leth played with a steely estrangement  by Christoph Waltz. I also liked Lucas Hedges Bob who slyly wisecracks his way amid the clutter and chaos. Yes, the infamous Terry Gilliam clutter is in full evidence, white pigeons, screens on their sides, clashing art work on the walls, dark staircases, weird people, electric (?) cables the size of fire hoses, rats, bizarre costumes and much, much more. And of course the thousand and one sight gags. The one I liked best (and we see it two or three times) comes to us through Oohen Leths computer screen. Its a certain kind of Website displaying Mlanie Thierry with a strategically placed heart-shaped sign reading Enter Here. (You have to see it to get the joke or have a saucy imagination.)

Matt Damon has a cameo as Management, Bobs all powerful father. Yes, there are some corporate jokes throughout as well as science gone amuck hilarity or attempted hilarity. I think this is one of Gilliams best but it is the performances by the actors that really carry this and perhaps thats a good thing in a Terry Gilliam movie.

Technically, the sound, makeup and special effects lacked the charm and professionalism of the superficially related ""Brazil"". While ""The Zero Theorem"" has ""a Terry Gilliam film"" on the cover, it is only after watching the credits roll that one sees Terry Gilliam did not write and direct this as he did Brazil. This is contrary to what is listed in IMDB, Wikipedia or Rotten Tomatoes but it is supported by the credits. The most telling evidence that this is not ""a Terry Gilliam film"" is the stubborn refusal of the plot characters to accept the fact that everything is nothing - a premise the protagonist in Brazil starts with but hopes is not true.",1447632000,,889,4.779220779220779

Even if the writers wanted an open ended story, something needed to be wrapped up... but nothing seemed finished at all.

Somehow this film encapsulates the confinement of corporeal existence and the false bounds of self.

It could almost be considered a parody, intentionally teasing in a fashion reminiscent of some of Andy Kaufman's pranks.

6287683,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"A mathematician is asked to solve a theorem which would prove that all equals nothing (basically that there is no meaning to the Universe,) a problem that others have tackled and abandoned.

Gilliam keeps asking questions even if he doesn't quite know how to answer them. Even the throwaway God answer in Time Bandits is at least something.

In this movie Gilliam continues themes (visual and otherwise) from all thru his career.  One could say that this is the answer to The Meaning of Life or an alternate take on Brazil, or that Las Vegas was the psychedelic practice run for this one, etc.
He certainly remains inventive and even if not fully original (even Timecop has a throwaway VR scene to equal this one) some of the ideas here are bound to become reality, he takes a page out of The Space Merchants in regards to advertising... I certainly would not like to see anything that offensive in my lifetime.

The hero lives in a church which allows for amazing set design, and when the VR suits show up, they could either be seen a demonic or symbolic of red bishop or cardinal garb.
There's a party where everyone carries a tablet around. The computer imagery design is reminiscent of games, which may even be where we are headed: treating programming work as games, and even if the visuals could not predict where we are headed the idea is valid, and thus not likely to seem as dated as other movies that show computer screens.",1446422400,,1433,4.5859375

The Zero Theorem is a humor-rich dystopic sci-fi drama that leaves the audience guessing until the end. Christoph Waltz plays the central character brilliantly, causing us to wind ourselves up with him, or should I say ""them""? The cast is an ensemble of multinational top stars; Chritoph Waltz being German and Austrian, the beautiful muse Bainsley is the French actor Melanie Thierry, and American actor Matt Damon is the ""Management"", with British actor Tilda Swinton as the therapist, another Brit as Waltz's character Qohen's supervisor, and a new-comer American Lucas Hedges as Bob.

The film is a satirical social commentary, which blends a great sadness and great humor in a brilliant way to make it a lot of fun.

It's difficult to entirely quantify Gilliam's work.  It was fascinating, but ultimately not as satisfying as was Brazil.  Honestly, I don't know why.  But I'm inclined think that the problem for me, was Christoph Waltz.  He is a brilliant actor in certain roles. Here, I'm not sure he understood the character.  But then, I'm not sure I understood the character either.  Either way, the film is fun to watch, but might leave the viewer hungry for something at the end.

But when he walks out the door and you see the bizarrely dressed people and yes, the sign bearing the name ""The Church of Batman the Redeemer"", you know you are in for an interesting ride!  The movie has a combination of William Gibson/Douglas Adams steampunk/cyberpunk/dystopian  feel to it, a sort of ""life, the meaning of it, and everything"" type theme.  It is not a derivation of those works, but I love those type genres.  It does get bogged down in Q's existential crisis towards the end and I can see how some people would lose interest, because it is very deep.

6287740,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"Never tried to review a movie before, so bear with me:

First I think that if a viewer is not accustomed to a Terry Gilliam film (or a Monty Python film for that matter), it can be a bewildering experience. Terry crams all sorts of 'junk' into his scenes. Trash (human and non-human) seems to be a big thing with him. Startlingly wild crayon colors clash with muted browns. Steampunk-style technology where everything is on the verge of falling apart. Sounds are enhanced and it can be overwhelming trying to sort out what is what. It's easier not to try, just let the madness flow over you.

I enjoyed watching Christoph ""no er"" Waltz plow his way through his character's gradual transformation. As far as the story, maybe I imagined more symbolisim than was actually in the film: He was called--literally--and everything, his mission if you will, was driven by that calling. He lived in a church with doves and other symbols of peace and faith. He had faith enough to believe that initial phone call was transformative, yet he couldn't seem to find peace. Also, I thought it was interesting that he was made to look like a baby in appearance (no hair, no eyebrows). A total innocent. His assignment (making zero = 100%) was insurmountable yet he surmounted technology itself by becoming part of it. There was more, like how he began to make changes in the food he was willing to eat, how he began saying ""I"" instead of the royal ""We,"" how had feelings for Bainsley and for Bob but my upload is due in 60 minutes. And I ordered pizza.

Plus...was there a reason to make Matt Damon look like Karl Lagerfeld?

The adult theme in the story line is portrayed inconsistently, and it's confusing. It goes from adult, to flirty and playful, to virtual rape, to run-away-with-me love.

Some people are going to like it, if they're in to the whole dream-like nonsense of similar movies like Jacob's Ladder or Eraserhead (though nowhere near that crazy). Nonsense is how I would describe the plot. There are some vague themes about finding purpose or something but to be honest they didn't really resonate that well with me. It's just a bizarre film that has a lot of interesting imagery. I thought it was worth viewing, but I also watched it for free with my Prime subscription. It didn't really change the way I viewed the world, but it held my attention throughout and I'm not sorry I watched it.",1443052800,,705,4.4728682170542635

An atheist might expect a man or woman of faith to find meaning in it, but trust me, this movie is rightly named, supposing that the ""zero theorem"" is real and there is no meaning in anything. I think the ones who wrote this movie hated God, because they seemed to cut him out and it didn't seem to be for healthy reasons. The moral of the story seems to be. ""You are all that matters, you are you're own universe, you are the only universe, you are alone...kill yourself."" I know a someone might say I'm just looking into myself, but this really seems to be the point of the movie. For anyone that cares.

If you expect happy ending closure and everyone gets what they deserve you may be wanting.

The scenes of code bits flying around on a screen and flighting into place in a large structure, only to have another nearby structure completely disintegrate are familiar and amusing (My wife finally has a glimmer of what's going on in my mind when I'm coding). That being said, the rest of the move is weak on everything... storyline, premise, character development. It's amusing, but the end scene is a major letdown and really makes little sense.

I looked like Qohen Leth, but was wearing a linen pull over robe and there wasn't a beach ball--only an extinguished flame. The female half of 'we' appeared in an eclipse party thrown by wolves on a jungle surrounded mountain top akin to that in Leth's fantasy.

Terry Gilliam is a mad genius! Yet, there is a problem with the entity interfacing in that our abstractions or models of the real may be so configured, but to compile what configuration of functions and other statements MIGHT work without careful systems analysis beforehand is akin to a monkey with a typewriter--for producing elaborate proofs and errata toward a theorem. What scares me is that some Computer Science Ph. D. will see this and persuade others that a convoluted 3D Tetris layer of abstraction is needed on top of Unified Modeling Language in order to keep the insufficiently pedantic out of the industry. As for the story, characters, actors, dialog, and directing--best I have seen in a frightfully long time within the fantasy and sci-fi genres. I could have watched several more hours and think that Thierry's temple prostitute to Qohen's Levitical priest could have delved into the holy of holies a bit more instead of sacrificing eros turned agape  on the altar of Mancom following the sickness of the Son of Mancom.

6287977,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"A wonderfully crafted cinematic work depicting a covert workaholic who is filled with anxiety and suppression under his complicated facade. Qohen lives a terribly scrutinized life and endures an experience of bondage with those around him. Waltz' character has a penchant for his line of work, which in this case is an austere computer programming position. He is highly sought after but fails to see the value of the present. This fascinating film is ripe with countless themes but its true narrative is in its depiction of a person following a well-traveled road to a promised land. The only problem: this road is being guided by a team of masterful tacticians who sinisterly pull at Qohen's emotional and logical faculties through a usage of acts and specious arguments. The most troubling, yet true part of this is the plausibility of all these characters being present in one's life and behaving in a similar capacity. Be careful not to become too frustrated with Qohens frequent misfortunes for he too learns lessons and has a subtle yet complete psychological transformation as the movie progresses. This lugubrious representation of a riddled and aimless life is thought-provoking. Well done to director Terry Gilliam and writer Pat Rushin for this masterpiece.",1439683200,,1269,5.165048543689321

 I don't care how deeply you try to interpret it, the movie was a senseless stream of consciousness with occasional moments that ushered some personal introspection.

Bad movies happen. To good directors. To good actors.
Maybe the stars didn't align.
It was boring. I just kept waiting for something to happen.
In some parts it felt like it was vaguely going for 1984 feel, but if you've actually read the book, it didn't work. Plus it was inconsistent anyway.
No, the ticks/stims by the main character didn't annoy me.
I didn't care about the kid running around showing the wonders of boobs and pizza.
They vastly under-used Tilda Swinton. It's pretty sad that the most eventful thing that happens with her computer program character is that her wig falls off. So very very sad.
And it felt like Matt Damon was in it just so they could wheel him out and go: ""Look! We've got Matt Damon in our movie!"" He was fine, it was his character that felt neither here nor there.

C'mon! The protagonist lives in a short sale church complete with stained glass windows, and sleeps between the organ pipes. The baptismal font is his kitchen sink!

6288079,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"An abstract and intriguing (and depressing, depending on you) look at nihilism and one man's struggle to come to grips with it.  Qohen Leth is a man who is literally waiting for destiny to call him to action.  He misses what he believes is the call that will literally tell him the meaning of his life, and has spent years essentially NOT living in order to earn the chance to get that phone call again.  He struggles with his job, his nihilism, and his growing impatience to receive his Calling.  He is desperately trying to believe that his life has meaning, and that a force external to him can and will grant that meaning, and he just has to wait.  In exchange for allowances to work at home in order to better receive his call, he is assigned to the Zero Theorem project:  a burn-out, nearly impossible project to calculate that all of the universe is meaningless (""Zero must equal 100%"").

A bit on-the-nose with the symbolism, but that's Gilliam's stock-and-trade:  Take the abstract, make it literal, and give it a form for the camera.  And it's every bit as odd as you'd think.  The world that Leth inhabits looks like one part run-down city and another part Willy Wonka's Fast-Paced Future World, all within the same street.  Crumbling architecture, bright graffiti, brighter advertisements, and the mindless enthusiasm of the ""everyday world"" will hit home with a lot of introverts and anti-social types, like myself.

Like many movies about the abstract meaning of existence, the ending may or may not strike a chord with you (hence the 4/5 stars).  If Gilliam is your thing, or you like artsy films, this will be right up your alley.",1438041600,,1646,4.713286713286713

6288087,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"There are certain works of fiction that one experiences as if one is having an anxiety dream. Those dreams where one would be flying, but can't seem to make it off the ground, for instance. The Zero Theorem is like that. It's a story of frustration and disassociation. Where the protagonist is trapped in a future where he doesn't seem to know quite what is going on, because what is going on makes no sense, although it seems to make sense to everyone around him.

Terry Gilliam has made a good variety of films, and what I like about them is that each one is unique. Where The Zero Theorem falls a little flat is that it tries to recreate, it seems, the same febrile Dystopia he created with Brazil, but it's not quite as interesting this time around. There are some of the same component: The anxiety-laden protagonist trapped in a job for which he is too good and that he can't seem to escape, the beautiful blond woman who could be his Beatrix, except everything gets ruined; the boss who relies on him and yet barely seems to know who he is.

The components work well together to create a future where things seem senseless and pointless. A great example is all the ""No"" signs hanging behind a park bench in one particular scene. No high heel shoes. No swimming (there's no water). It's a cynical look at the future, for sure, though definitely not as dark as Brazil, and not quite as satisfying.

People want stories with resolutions. With happy endings. Where things all fit together and make sense. I love the fact that, with Terry Gilliam, you have no idea whether you'll get any of these things. And with The Zero Theorem, you may not even be sure if you've gotten any of them after the film is over. This definitely isn't a first date movie or a family film, but it's a great bit of cinema if you feel like poking your brain with a stick.",1437696000,,1850,4.419354838709677

6288144,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"A show about a brilliant loner struggling with something not fully defined...Insanity? Illness? Desperation? All of the above?  He is clearly suffering and broken. This is demonstrated by his loss of hair, his constant statement that ""We are dying"" (and his quirky method of referring to himself in the plural), his need to be alone, and his desperate need to receive a phone call.

Perhaps he is simply insane. Perhaps he burdened with brilliance. But he represents each of us as we struggling to adjust to an increasingly dysfunctional life.  He is also waiting for THE call from... god? the universe? his own inner voice?... we don't know.  But this call is to give him a purpose in life. Without that call, his life has no purpose. This seems a bit heavy handed for an allegory of our own existence on this blue planet.  Or perhaps it is something simple. Perhaps he is just insane.

He is assigned by an all powerful corporation to a seemingly impossible task, he and that task are intrinsically linked. His life is pointless and the task is to prove that the universe - all existence - is equally pointless. Zero-equals-100%, if proven, will show that all existence will cease and have no purpose at all. Another allegorical display of human existence brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Waltz, who, IMHO can easily carry any movie handed to him.  His acting is riveting. The plot, the purpose, the meaning behind some of the symbolism is either candy-coated and glaring, or lost and muddled.  But the core of the show gets the point across, and you can't help but emotionally connected to our broken hero who is achingly close to proving that everything is pointless and is driven mad by the very idea, while simultaneously perpetuating the pointlessness of his very life and watching him fail to seek the very things which may make his brief life worthy.

The visuals are perfectly spot on. The bright, garish colors and continuous noise, interruption, disruption, and intrusion perfectly demonstrates how technology is pervasively intruding into our human world. The 'stalking' advertisement was so spot-on irritating.  I had a visceral reaction to it and I personally fear the day that will become a reality!  In this show, only the elite can afford silence and tranquility while the rest are punished with noise and clamoring distractions. There's much meaning that could be gleaned from this movie, but it did leave me feeling incomplete and half hearted.  Excellent acting. Excellent visuals and mode painting.  A bit sluggish in the plot.",1436832000,,2553,4.950819672131147

6288350,1,B00IRD8JJ6,"There is no deeper meaning of life in the 'god sense', or in the 'metaphysical sense'. There is no personal god. All of it will end in the ""big crunch"" and - meaningwise - all of it adds up to nothing. I don't think in 2015 these things come as surprises to any thinking person who knows a little bit of physics and contemporary cosmology. So what can you do as a single individual on Planet Earth? Go out and try to find something that gives some meaning to your individual life, and make some use of your time while you can. And  - almost needless to say - don't wait for imaginary higher powers to do the job for you. Terry Gilliam (together with the rest of the Monty Python crew) fully covered this subject in the ""Meaning of Life"" and a variety of other works.

Why then, go back to this tedious non-question in 2015, and make a 2 hour borefest from it? With all the problems of the world, and with all the great pieces or literature that could be turned into great movies -  are there no better topics for Terry Gilliam to tackle??

Even as a huge fan of the director, I am sorry but can't give any stars for this nonsense. The striking Gilliamesque visuals, the distopian future, the great actors... all for nothing in this case. The movie looks like ""Brazil"" and ""12 Monkeys"", but does not give the viewer any catharsis, does not convey any novel message, does not trigger any deeper philosophical conversations and does not illuminate anything.

It addresses the want for oneness with another, of that aspect of the lover taking you away to something beautiful into the sunset. At the same time he is afraid to connect because of what it brings.

I guess Gilliam decided the best one could do was a virtual beach at sunset w virtual sex. I understand the critique of leaving the churches behind and all their ridiculous trappings but Gilliam, like so many others, has thrown the baby out with the bathwater and is therefore left with nothing but a dystopian future with no higher existence than earth and no higher love than nature.

Fair enough. Simple.

Anyways, his boss does this for him, and puts him on an extremely difficult task..

down hill fast. And it ends on a note that doesn't make any sense at all.. I can assume a
lot from what I watched, but I don't like to play guessing games when it comes to stories..

6288429,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"Though I like Terry Gilliam, his work on Time Bandits and Brazil being my favorites, in this film as others, they too often feel like stage theater rather than feature films.  There are moments of genius and he truly endeavors to be original, as he once stated in one of his critiques of other directors.  However his quirkiness and stylistic vision can become monotonous at times, and you just want to yell at the screen to calm down and anchor itself - as if everything in the picture is flittering about.  This nervous energy he imbues his films with is fantastic in small doses but often pervades scene after scene - clearly his stylistic sensibility at work.  Terry Gilliam is a true visionary and creative force in film and this film has much to recommend it.

The movie explores technology, humanity, the soul, meaning in life, and so forth. If you're a fan of quirky but odd sci-fis you should probably check it out.

What made me give it fewer stars was that it tended to meander a good deal. Though I did like the absurdity, such as the clones, the computer psychiatrist and such, and I liked the sci-fi ideas like people who crunch entities (data with personalities) instead of numbers, nothing really quite connected. It was mostly a bunch of interesting and thought provoking ideas strung together. Eventually, the movie just concluded- I don't think the ending really brought it all together, and your theory on what the ending means is just as good as mine.

6288474,2,B00IRD8JJ6,"I like Terry Gilliam. I like his movies, especially those made in the 80s like Time Bandits, Brazil and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. I like his visuals style that is always unique. Now his latest film The Zero Theorem arrives. OK, the visuals are certainly unique, but somehow it is hard for me to keep watching the film because it is boring.

The Zero Theorem is about a reclusive computer programmer named Qohen Leth (Christoph Waltz) living in an alternate universe, obsessively working on a mysterious project commissioned by Management (Matt Damon). And Qohen thinks he almost received a message from someone about the meaning of life, and still waiting for that. Oh, and he is visited by Bainsley (M&eacute;lanie Thierry), a beautiful woman who seems interested in him, and later Bob (Lucas Hedges), son of Management, who gives some advice.

Thus it goes on and on. While watching the visually interesting but narratively incoherent movie, I found myself trying to focus on the things that are going on before me, but just couldnt. Obviously the films muddled story is about something the director wants to communicate, but he fails simply because we are not allowed to connect any of these eccentric people.

Am I missing something? Maybe. Maybe the director will be happy to explain the ideas behind the films details, and Im ready to hear that. But of course, I could watch Brazil again instead.",1431907200,,1412,4.92436974789916

Aided by fifteen year old computer genius Bob, the son of Management, the socially awkward Qohen enjoys Bainsley's company in a virtual beach reality.

The same old cliches of a lonely sad guy in the near future pulled out of his technology cocoon by unwelcome visitors has been done so many times, most significantly in his own ""Brazil"" 30 years ago.  This time there are echoes of Orwell's ""big brother"" constantly watching and manipulating.  There was a missed opportunity here to really explore the question of ""what makes life worth living.""

Christoph Walsh's detached Qohen is a computer-station drone (aren't we all) who refers to himself as ""we"" in rhythm with the sameness of everybody. He is sorta kinda tantalyzed into a romance with a webcam girl, the willing Bainsley (Melanie Thierry), sort of appreciated by his bootlicking boss, David Thewlis, and sort of befriended by a fifteen-year old, computer genius (Lucas Hedges).

Protagonist Qohen Leth is a programmer who always refers to himself in the plural and works for a company called Mancom.  He is assumed to be genius but quite insane.  He is always waiting for a phone call that will set all things right and explain the purpose of his life.

Qohen is assigned to solve the Zero Theorem a mysterious mathematical conundrum which will eventually prove that life is meaningless.  This task has been the cause of previous programmers to lose their minds.  The beautiful Bainsley appears and they have a relationship via VR.

The story is secondary to the vast visual spectra that defines this film; from black holes to idyllic beach settings.

My impression after watching Zero Theorem is that Gilliam made a very similar film to his masterpiece Brazil, only this one is in the context of the Internet Age. While it falls well short of Brazil as a film, it still has plenty of the dark, witty comedy, philosophical musings, and unique stylistic flare that I love in many of Gilliam's films. And of course Cristoph Waltz's performance is spectacular, as usual.

The grand meaning I was waiting for never really came together, but I think that may be the intention. I didn't enjoy this film as much as Brazil or Fear and Loathing or even 12 Monkeys, but I still found it a solid and entertaining effort by Gilliam.",1429574400,,788,4.581560283687943

This movie explores loneliness, feeling different and out of sync with everyone else, and having a really crappy job. I identified with all those themes and Qohen's (Christoph Waltz) search for his soul's ""calling"" that would reveal why he is here on earth and what he should be doing.

6288801,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"I purchased this film on the basis of Terry's name being associated with the film, and what seemed like a story line that I could relate to in some way. I decided to wait before doing a review simply because I suspected that what would happen has happened, that is the reviews do not seem to match up with the film I saw.

This is one film that desperately needs a directors commentary, or more to the point, a writer and directors commentary. The film is eminently watchable in my view. As one reviewer noted, the Church of Batman the Redeemer is a great joke, and little elements inserted through the film make a great sub-text. The existential angst is rightly perceived as the pivot of the action and, more to the point, the thought in the film. I really hate to go along with the critics on films, but if you look at other sites, this film is well received. As to why it took 2 years to come to disc, I don't know. What perplexes me even more is how this film that asks so many questions, is criticised as being somehow ""nihilistic"" since it discusses how some non-believers view things, and how a believer approaches things. The extras specifically disavow a connection to Brazil in that they are specifically trying to not be in that genre. This film is really quite thoughtful, and multiple viewings confirm that for me, at least. Some films really do require some thought, just as some songs do. On what was supposedly a low budget, this film was created in a stunning way. If you want to look at a film that asks questions, then this is for you, if you don't like films that require you to think, then you should avoid this film. In my view, what you say about the film says more about you than what it says about the film. The high points, the people who are happy are not  Q( Qohen ), hence he is dressed in black, and no co-incidence Q is a believer.

The character representing management is Matt Damon's, melting into the background for most of the time in Chameleon like shades; Delivering his lines in a laconic form, he reminds me of Phillip Seymour Hoffman for some odd reason. I would suggest that some of the more basic elements of the story are drawn from the cubical world that the current world delivers so well. In some form, this struck me as a kind of Sci-Fi version of Dilbert. The other arche-type that struck me is that this story in this remarkably insightful film has similarities to the Book of Job, except that there is no ""Meta-Narrative"", that is the divine narrative we see in the book of Job is the cosmic overview, and what this film may be attempting to do is to hand over that discursive element, or basically the questions of meaning are given to the watcher of the film to sort out for themselves ( just my
opinion/conjecture). I just may change my view later of this film, which does not invalidate the questions in the film, simply changes my conditional answers. If I may suggest, watch the film once for the experience, then put your analytical mind on ( or Hat on, as one Logician stated in one book) and see what you can sort out. If the original TOTAL RECALL can ask deep and meaningful questions , how much more can Terry Gilliam ( and by the way, if you have watched TOTAL RECALL and thought, what deep and meaningful??, just listen to the Commentary track that Verhoeven does on TOTAL RECALL, and it will change your view of that film forever).",1429315200,,3397,4.42332268370607

He goes to a party only to talk to management about this,  management doesn't care.  But then, after his life is saved by a beautiful girl using the Heinlech Maneuver, the manager (Affleck) says he CAN work on the ""Zero Theorem""  at home -- and at that point I stopped watching.

While it didn't have the same visceral impact to me as ""Brazil"" or ""12 Monkeys"", I very much enjoyed ""Zero Theorem"" and plan to watch it again.  The neon look, gritty feel, and tremendous scene detail of the film were exactly what I would have expected from Gilliam and I found the characterizations to be very good.  All in all was very pleased with the acting in the film -- particularly Christoph Waltz.  Each of the actors in main character roles revealed bits and pieces of their back story in ways that made me immediately want to know more, but also brought into focus -- sometimes rather subtly -- many of the characters' current motivations.  The story seemed, to me, to be quite straightforward and was summed up very effectively by Management's statement as to why Qohen was selected for the Zero Theorem project.  Indeed, it seems very ""Gilliam"" to point out the absurdity of someone who, while waiting for the deliverance of significance or meaning in life, effectively leads a meaningless life.

Do I sound biased? I told you, I love and have loved his work for the better part of 40 years! It is more the shame that there is so much that this guy attempted to say, yet due to various economic strains, we will never have the chance to either see or hear it. Take for example the failed Don Quixote...that could have been a great film, with content to rival Voltaire's Candide, I am sure.

6288891,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"I like Terry Gilliam movies. I would have him autograph my copy of The Fisher King. Even back before that was cool.
Tideland was really interesting all on it's own. And then he brought himself to it as well.
The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus was supposed to be a ""classic"" Gilliam film with all of his tropes. Unfortunately one of his tropes is total disaster, and that's what happened when the star died 2/3 of the way thru. It's an awesome movie in spite of it all. Which you children of the future now know. But back during Terry's lifetime, nobody even tried to watch it.
So then Zero Theorem came out, and it was like  Brazil II. Or maybe Brazil, the Remake. It feels like once again Terry Gilliam is trying to make a movie that Terry Gilliam fans will love. All the Terry Gilliam tropes are there. It's a brilliant movie. It has meaning. There are metaphors. It's funny.
I had exactly 2 problems with it.
1) I couldn't care less about the main character. He's a metaphor, and only occasionally much else. It would have been nice if I could have felt any connection at all to him. The kid -- I cared for the kid! The supervisor, I even liked him. The main character came across to me like Max Von Sydow in an untranslated Swedish film. I could see what he was doing, but I couldn't really figure out why.
2) I was embarrassed by some of the sexuality of one of the characters. Sure, that's her job. Sure, we're supposed to get that, even though the main character doesn't. But, somehow it just seemed too much. Self-consciously too much.
But of course, maybe 1) and 2) were supposed to be that way, and i just don't get it yet. Have you watched Time Bandits lately? Or Fisher King, if it's not too soon. They mean completely different things than what they did the first few times I saw them. Probably this one will too.
I like everything Terry Gilliam does. And I want to like this one more. And probably I will. But after just the first viewing, it seemed a little lacking in the heart, although it's head was quite full of good stuff.
So give it a try. You know you want to. But you might have to try more than once before you're totally satisfied with it. At least, I hope so.",1428710400,,2183,4.311435523114355

He has created some true masterpieces. This film offered color, a dystopian perspective, and possible alternative timeline considerations.

6288968,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"As with pretty much all Terry Gilliam-directed films, you can't expect anything like linear plot development, sensible dialogue, nor even a token foot still on the ground of recognizable reality for the first half of the experience.  That is, of course, why I love his films - you're going for a carnival ride from the first to the last frame.  If this film has to be reduced to a simple thread, it would be the search for the point of life in a bewildering, dehumanized existence. The Administrator sums it up pretty well in his next-to-last line (no, I'm not going to tell you).

The part I didn't like that much was the actual ending scene - perhaps simply because it wasn't at all what I was expecting, and thus was left with a feeling of having been let down.  The more I mused on that scene, however, the more I think I get it - Qohen can finally do whatever he wants with his life - manipulate his world, find meaning if he wishes - albeit in a virtual environment from which he cannot escape.

The character he plays in Zero Theorem spends the entire time whining and feeling sorry for himself.

6288988,1,B00IRD8JJ6,"...if you are feeling suicidal when viewing it.

As for myself, I recently watched it from the very beginning frame to the last of the rolling credits and as you'll quickly discern if you peruse this review a little further, I did not like this movie. In fact, I would go way beyond that to state the following:

I LOUDLY REBUKE and REJECT this movie's version of God portraying Him as being a non-existent manifestation of an artificial reality projected by religious enthusiasts, this being one characteristic of all godless philosophies including this movie's dismally depressing theme that pitches the preposterous proposition that nothing has any lasting value or true meaning whatsoever either in the material realm of finite things or in the spiritual domain of personal beings! And if you can read this, then you're most likely a member of that latter group existing as an evolving mortal personality living on a material plane of planetary existence (our ""trial trip in the flesh"") that this movie's conspicuously conveyed thematic proclamation has summarily condemned as being void of any meaning. And rather than make this life meaningless for those of us who believe in God (one of the false accusations proclaimed by this toilet-paper script), the exact opposite is true since this planetary life we were given is the time-space arena wherein we make the final decisions and choices that confirm our continuing existence as God-seeking ascending sons and daughters of our Creator Father or conversely validate the never-ending sleep of spirit-death that kicks in posthumously if a God-hater or God-denier has wholeheartedly rejected the Paradise-ascension plan. So how could life be meaningless except perhaps to the material-minded mortal indoctrinated by atheism's denial of God's existence thus destroying any hope of meaningful values lasting beyond the grave? What an absurd if not dangerously damaging concept put forth by this movie! If an entire planet collectively embraced that kind of a godless philosophy that jumped into the deep end of the chronic depression pool of perpetual meaninglessness, it could theoretically be the beginning of the end of that entire civilization if a mass suicide on a planetary scale were to take place.

The seeds we sow in time are harvested in eternity.",1428364800,4,2311,5.223719676549865

It tries to raise some thought provoking questions, but falls short by failing to address any of them. The mysteries surrounding the zero theorem, the main character's phone call... everything is just left hanging at the end, with no satisfying resolutions. It seems a point was attempted at the end (that faith is pointless?) but damned if I can decipher it among the absurd epilepsy of an ending.

Also, a lot of the movie just feels pointless. Most everything to do with the hooker/love interest really seems like a waste of time, as it's not interesting nor does it seem to have a point.

I mean... maybe the point was in fact that the movie is rather pointless--an attempt at existentialism, perhaps? But if so, it was just poorly done and really left me feeling meh at the end. The only reason I give it 3 stars and not 1 or 2 is because of the visuals and acting. That was all that kept me interested until the end.",1428278400,,1010,4.483695652173913

It is an existential commentary on the world of the early 21st century.

Will we someday prove a zero theorem? Will it be disproven and thus we will find and reclaim our souls? This question is unanswered by the film, as it is unanswered in our present day world.

I get the sense that those who have reviewed this film negatively either don't want to confront the ugly hollowness of everyone's own soul that is part of the human condition, or they must feel sufficiently fulfilled by the modern life that they simply cannot identify with the metaphysical theme of this movie. I don't blame them for it, but I wouldn't take their word that this is not a film worth watching. It absolutely is, and then go look in a mirror and ponder the notion that the protagonist's name, spelled with a Q, no U, might actually be representing just that: you.",1428019200,,1539,4.568840579710145

I'm sure there were different levels (scientific and mathematical) that I would never understand, but on basic levels, I appreciated the message. Qohen reminds me of Anthony Hopkins' character in Remains of the Day: a reclusive loner, ascetic, schizoid, loyal to a fault, and committed to the wrong cause.

SPOILERS: It's not hard to see ourselves in Qohen: someone who has put off living until he's sure of what he's living for. That may be the greatest sin of all. By letting go of his attachments (especially to his plural selves) and jumping in to the void, he reaches heaven.

Do not want to do spoilers here... so that's all we can say on that. But with that said this movie is not for everyone.. It will hurt your head if you are not already familiar with the chaos theory.

Chaos theory is a field of study in mathematics, with applications in several disciplines including meteorology, sociology, physics, engineering, economics, biology, and philosophy. Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditionsa response popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general. This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as follows:
Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.

Chaotic behavior can be observed in many natural systems, such as weather and climate. This behavior can be studied through analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincar maps.",1427932800,,1633,5.580645161290323

However one thing that this movie failed to do akin to the multitude of movies that work so hard to discredit Christianity (which should make you a little paranoid why media tries so hard to make you not trust it or even loath it): is that it dismissed that perhaps ""the purpose of life"" is indeed in a simple truth that most have been exposed to (even exposed through this movie though granted in a perverted/condescending way): is that the truth has been so pure and simple yet rejected so vehemently by the ""intellectuals"" of our age. The saddest part is that the TRUTH is out there and very accessible but due to cognitive dissonance created by our media, educational institutions most people reject it. ""Where is the wise?...Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe...but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Greeks foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God stronger than men"" ~1 Corinthians 1:20-25
...""But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the mighty; and the base things of the world and the things that are despised God has chosen, and the things that are not, to bring to nothing the things that are...1"" Corinthians 1:27-28.

6289203,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"More impressionistic art from the master.  Go into it with this in mind, it is not about the narrative but the visual language throughout (like the Grand Budapest Hotel).  Open your eyes and your mind and give yourself a chance to process the visuals during and after the fact.

Gilliam is almost unmatched in world building, every prop and detail belongs and is part of the narrative itself. There are sight gags meant to illicit a smile more than a guffaw, but they all have a message (The Church of Batman the Redeemer - a comment on the movie industry that pigeonholes films into marketable categories; the slew of ""do not"" signs at the park bench - a nod to the real set of passive controls that society imposes, etc.)

Many people comment on the ending and how unsatisfying it is.  For films within the narrative framework, it is.  It is a almost a silly way to end.  But within the impressionist's tableau, the search for meaning can only end in ambiguity and the final comment that each is soley responsible for the meaning imposed on it, the movie, and indeed life itself.

A few interpretations offered (semi-spoilers follow):

At a literal level (as much as it is possible), Q. is just a cog in a machine bent on profit.  He is eventually sucked into the machine and is given his version of a peaceful afterlife as a reward.  Okay, now let's go buddhist: Q. had outs presented to him but he was his own worse enemy and let his desire (for the phone call) cloud his opportunities for escape.  Q. could never find the zen of the moment to see the escape route (if escape was ever possible).  Let's go Christian:  Management, or God, sends his son to give ""Us/We/Q."" a path and Q. follows it.  In following the son, Q. finds himself and becomes ""I"" and not a plural ""We"" and not just cog.  He is then useless to fate, or God or Management, as he is now his own person and finds his heaven.  How about nihilism?:  There is no meaning.  Period.  Make something up and be happy with it.  Let's not forget hedonism:  Q, dude, if you had just thought a bit more with your groin (or heart?) then you could have bailed with the stripper and had a hella good time and forgotten all this existential stuff that is meaningless (which is what management tells him in the end).  Not being primal and more animalistic leads to isolation and loneliness.",1427760000,,2347,4.470588235294118

6289259,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"Not as good as Terry Gilliam's other works, but still an interesting film. It has the same magnitude of visual style that made Brazil and 12 Monkeys classics, but without the ""special something"" that made the insanity payoff.

The film has a strong start that pulls the viewer immediately into a world that feels familiar and yet bizarre, yet, as it progresses there is frustratingly little exploration. Whereas the world of Brazil was a character into itself, The Zero Theorem teases the viewer with an intriguing world and dangles it just out of reach.

The main character is never fully explored other than hints as to what made him become the humorless and obsessive man that we see in the film. Strong indications are made that a previous life event turned him into the man we see, from a socially normal person into a withdrawn autistic caricature, but we never get to find out what the nature of this event was. The film takes the form of a character study, but one of a man already thoroughly in progress, and the characters lack of ""origin"" makes some of his decisions and reactions seem canned.

The other characters in the film have a variety of amusing quirks that make even one time appearances memorable. The supporting cast feels like the successful merging of the style and humor of previous Gilliam films with that of the works of Marc Caro (such as Delicatessen and Le Cite des Enfant Perdue); from the doctor who steals and fawns over his colleagues desk trinkets, to the ""clone"" twins who are tall and lanky and a rotund dwarf. Each supporting character feels unique and as if they have a story that could be explored in far more depth.

The ending of the film was unfortunately lackluster. The movie is full of hooks that make one expect a grand finale with a bizarre denouement of the kind we've grown to expect from Gilliam, but instead we're treated to a sudden and chaotic series of events that unravels the main character to the point of breaking and brings the story to a crashing halt. This nicely mirrors the journey of the main character and is almost certainly intentional, but it is frustrating when all that I wanted at that point was to see more of the world.

Ultimately, the film is a picture of a decent into madness that follows an already damaged man into the (quite literal) abyss that he made for himself. It is set in a bizarre world that I desperately wish we'd seen more of and is frustrating in that it has fewer unanswered questions than those that were left ""unasked"".",1425427200,3,2515,4.617449664429531
6289260,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"This is really Terry Gilliam's masterpiece (so far). He has captured the ""solitude in the hive"" aspect of life like no one else. The movie has it's moments of humor, but it is an existential, hopeless humor.

6289300,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"Wow. This has so much going on, I'm not sure where to start. So I'll start simply, with the visuals.

Correction, there's nothing simple about Gilliam's visuals. A burned-out church become Qohen's lair, home, refuge, and cyber-bunker. A computer center modeled on Soviet steel mill. An analytics office populated with roller skaters and skateboarders, and exercise bikes for desks. (OK, that last isn't too far out, not once you've seen a real-life treadmill desk.) Costumes from - well, everywhere. An urban ad-scape that makes life in a pinball machine look peaceful.

Then there's the talent: Christoph Waltz, in a role that only he (or maybe John Malkovich) could have pulled off. Tilda Swinton, Matt Damon, David Thewlis, and lots more - not always big roles, but very good ones.

Then, the plot or plot-like sequence of events. Well, it's Gilliam - don't expect clear explanations. Individual vs The System seems to be a big theme. In fact, it might be Individual vs Everyone Else, or Everyone Else vs. Individual. It certainly feels like the latter. There's also an odd analogy, in using the search for life's meaning (or lack) as a personal quest, a root of insanity, and marketing gimmick: what's the difference?

Enjoy this one best by simply letting it wash over you. If, like a prospector panning for gold, that washes a nugget or two of clarity your way, great. But, even if it doesn't, you sill still have spent the time in a visually rich environment,

6289304,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"Qohen (not Quinn) has been given the most dubiously impossible task imaginable: to prove that ""zero must equal one hundred percent."" He is seemingly the perfect individual for this, a loner stuck in his falling down tenement, afraid of human contact, convinced that he (or ""we"") is dying. He's waiting for his call, THE Call, that will explain everything to him.  Enter a computer hacking teenager and a beautiful temptress.  And the Zero Theorem.

So many of Terry Gilliam's films revolve around three things: acting, visuals, and concepts.  Conceptually, ZERO THEOREM reaches for the stars and falls somewhere short, though this may be due more to Pat Rushin's screenplay, which meanders a bit in the middle.  As for the visuals, this is up there with Gilliam's best: a deviously dark tapestry of color, technology, and pseudo-dystopian themes of oppression and the corporate omnisciency. Basically, think BRAZIL done with modern technology.

The real winner here, and the reason you should really check this out (if you aren't a Gilliam fan already) is the acting.  The film hinges on a nuanced, brilliant performance from Christoph Waltz.  He's in practically every scene, and he owns this role and the film.  The supporting cast moves in and out, but is reliably solid: Melanie Thierry, Lucas Hedges, David Thewlis, Tilda Swinton, and Matt Damon, plus a joyous scene with Ben Whishaw and Peter Stormare.  (Well, maybe ""joyous"" isn't the proper word, though I felt utterly delighted while watching it.)

Don't get me wrong: there's much more here than solid acting.  And don't let those three stars fool you; if not for a few troubles with the script, I would've given this four stars easily.  This is a Terry Gilliam film that doesn't quite reach the heights that his films can, but still manages to soar in spots.  Watch it for the visuals, watch it for the acting.  I simply recommend watching it.",1421712000,68,1904,4.962145110410095
6289305,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"Bravo!- Terry Gilliam- Bravo!!!  Throughout the film- I kept smiling and was amazed- perfect movie. I haven't seen a good movie in such a time like this. For me- I love- Brazil, Baron Munchausen, Time Bandits, The Fisher King, & 12 Monkeys- ""although this film-12 Monkeys- a great film- could of been even greater"" but these are his best. I either love or hate his films- these films SUCK- Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, The Brothers Grimm, The Imaginatoriom ""whatever it's called""- sucks!!!  There's a TV series now of 12 Monkeys- nothing to do with Terry Gilliam- that I watched that sucks- I wish he would do a sequel of 12 Monkeys- that would probably satisfy my completion of a perfect- 12 Monkeys film- noted earlier. Now about this remarkable film- The Zero Theorem film, I can't even recommend this to people at work- they wouldn't get it. This film is really for fans that are already into Monty Python type humor of Gilliam- His imaginary fantasy & humor is the best- I laughed so loud when he opened the box of pizza- and the box included an audio recording of ""Happy Happy Pizza"". This film like Brazil- shows a possible ridiculous future of an already ridiculous present- so enjoy like I will- over and over again I will watch this again and again.",1421712000,7,1260,4.595555555555555
6289306,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"Initial Note:
It becomes quite obvious when diving into the one-star ratings that someone or some group conducted an organized campaign to berate this film and drive its overall rating as low as they could. The same identical review title followed by a narrative containing a short phrase of a half-dozen words or less from reviewers for whom it's their ONLY product review reeks of a denigration campaign. It's not all the one-star, but it is a large number of them. Keep this in mind when looking at the rating summary.

While not his ""best"" it's definitely among his much better films, with its underlying themes in an existential vein similar to ""Brazil"" and ""12 Monkeys."" It helps to understand what Zero Theorem is with some discussion about what it is not. There are many misconceptions about this film. Sadly too many of them come from film critics who should know better by now. Some will bash films if they're not ""high concept"" narratives, or if they don't conveniently fit into an expected genre, or if they break from a director's past style. Finally there are those ""haters"" that will bash everything from a specific director. If you're expecting a comedy, go elsewhere (baffles me why some expect all Gilliam's films to be comedies). Likewise, if you're expecting a prima facie narrative reality story, go elsewhere; it's not a high concept ""popcorn"" film for casual viewing while browsing the Internet on your laptop. If you're expecting it to neatly fit into a preconceived genre classification, go elsewhere. Most of Gilliam's films are a genre of their own and this one is no exception. You won't ""get it"" regarding what this film is about if you approach it from any of these perspectives.

The real power of this film is in its underlying existential themes and the symbolism used to convey them, albeit peppered with some comic relief. Without spoiling it with details, look for the Grand Irony between what Qohen (Christoph Waltz) is desperately seeking personally and the project his thankless, unrewarding and mentally grinding job has him working on. Every element of the story as it unfolds contributes to one or both of these as Qohen hurtles toward a personal existential collision of the two. Gilliam uses a fantasy world to distance the audience from a narrative reality to better expose the underlying themes, and enhance or amplify them.

Keep this in mind when viewing it and you'll understand Zero Theorem. The audience is ultimately left to draw its own conclusions about the two halves of the irony that dramatically collide at the end.",1421625600,13,2573,4.910344827586207
6289307,4,B00IRD8JJ6,Weird. Wasn't willing to watch it again to completely understand the plot if that is even possible.,1421625600,,99,4.882352941176471
6289308,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"Calling ""The Zero Theorem"" science-fiction would be an understatement. Thats because this film transcends categorization or a label  it is a wholly unique work spun directly from the mind of auteur director Terry Gilliam. This movie is such a joyously cinematic pleasure to watch, and the more you know about cinema and Gilliam, the angles on which you can appreciate ""The Zero Theorem"" multiply.

As a social and political satire in the vain of George Orwell and other Gilliam fare such as Brazil, this film works magnificently. Often times when I watch a movie with a clear political message, I feel underwhelmed by the statement, and that is often because I am underwhelmed by the filmmaking that surrounds it. Not the case whatsoever with ""The Zero Theorem"". The theme of this film is basically that our modern society and government has molded us into units  worker bees  we get up, do our jobs and go about our mundane existences, and repeat. Of course the ideas of the film encompass many more complex and specific aspects of that theme, but thats the general point. Gilliam does such an unbelievably fantastic job not only getting across this theme in the characters plights and the films plot, but with incredible visuals that I couldn't take my eyes off of.

Even on surface level, the visuals of ""The Zero Theorem"" are mind blowing and delicious to the eye. Luckily however, they are not only important as artful mise-en-scne and cinematography, but as an element of the movie that is genuinely significant in relation to the storytelling. Something of a science-fiction fantasia with reoccurring visually-comedic motifs, this films aesthetic skin is likely the most inspired and wonderful thing youll see in a cinema this year, regardless of what you think of the film itself.

And this is clearly a divisive and somewhat polarizing film, as evidenced by the films response among viewers and critics. As much as I tend to believe that this is mostly because of mainstream movie goers unwillingness to accept or enjoy different, experimental and original ideas in this medium, I also accept that this simply isn't a film for everyone, and that some just won't gravitate towards it as I did.

I love basically everything about ""The Zero Theorem"", and its the kind of film that I will be watching many, many more times in the future. Not only to more fully comprehend and appreciate the profundity and complexity of its themes and ideas, but also to revisit a vividly-palated, memorizing and beautifully realized vision of our world and the directions that it is going.",1421020800,17,2578,4.926267281105991

6289311,2,B00IRD8JJ6,"Sigh. Another year, another Terry Gilliam-o-Rama that's all style and no substance. It's been obvious from day one that Gilliam is much more of an art director than a film director. He's always been far more interested in -- and talented with -- sets, costumes and color schemes than with story, characters and actors. A few times back in the day it all worked out anyway. Holy Grail, Brazil, Munchausen are all very good to near-great, although he came close to sabotaging the latter two with his excesses. But more and more his movies have devolved into plotless, storyless, characterless pastiches of visual gimmickry that just ramble and rattle on and on from one scene to another to another to The End. I love that one critic called this ""steampunk eye-candy"" -- which actually describes several of his recent films, especially Dr. Parnassus. This one isn't quite the super-overindulgent mess that Parnassus was. For Gilliam, it's almost restrained. But it's still a pretty empty and meaningless grab-bag of images with little heart and no brain. He should have stopped while he was ahead, which, sadly, was quite a few years ago now.",1420675200,,1139,4.9375

6289315,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"Terry Gilliam has done many of the really thoughtful movies of the last twenty years and this one is no exception.

A dark movie about a dystopian world right around the corner! A mordent comedy in Gilliam's famous style.  Imagine a future world in which people don't think but constantly carry around communication devices and constantly need to be entertained. Imagine a world where TV type ad's stalk your every step as you walk down the street, constantly trying to sell you stuff. Imagine a world were people go to parties constantly self-absorbed into their communication devices and no longer interact with each other. Imagine a world where people puff on imaginary cigarettes they don't light.

I would say Zero Theorem  is about a world full of plastic people who identify with their 6G phones and need constant entertainment, who can't think, meditate or carry on meaningful conversations; nosey companies that follow you around and try to constantly sell you things; rich bosses who try to force you to work 24/7 and work yourself to death to make more money for them; and the search for a meaningful  life in all of this din of screaming media. A study reported on NPR recently stated that people with 6G phones average spending 2 hours a day on them...

The lead character Qohen (played by Christolph Waltz, the Nazi in Inglorious Bastards, the dentist/bounty hunter from Django Unchained ) is a brilliant but extremely introverted  programmer working on a computer powered by bicycle pedals that must be pedaled fast before he can enter code. He works for MANCOM.  He refers to himself in the first person plural, like royalty, but he is the only sane person in this world. He wants nothing more than to work in isolation from a world constantly trying to invade his privacy. Q is mostly motivated by a desire to just attain a Samadhi like state of release from this world of constant commercial stimulation, symbolized by a black hole in space.  Q wants a mystical phone call which will explain to him the meaning of his life. He writes ""entities"" using bricks of differential equations instead of the computer code we are more familiar with. He tries to get medical leave from his company from a group of three doctors of a type you will recognize from 12 Monkeys.

The company owner of MANCOM, (Matt Damon) gives him a seemingly impossible computer program to write which will solve the meaning of life, which he, Damon, will be able to capitalize, if found. He want to work Q until he goes crazy or solves these equations. Damon hooks Q up with a crack teen whiz programmer. You will recognize Q's boss played by David Thewlis as the same type of boss from ""Brazil"".  When Q tries to quit the company owner tries to motivate/force him to work with sexy young a Lolita-like girlfriend played my Melanie Thierry. The owner tries to motivate him with a computerized Read-only-Memory psychiatrist (Tilda Swinton) who offers Q cookie-cutter psychobabble solutions to his quest for meaning.

As with ""Brazil"" , The ""Imaginarium of DR Parnassus: and ""12 Monkeys"" the ideas and sight-gags come so fast you have to re-watch the movie so you don't miss anything. Be sure to the features at the end of the movie about shooting the movie on the cheap in Rumania, buying plastic costumes by the pound and wrangling rats.

Ignore many reviews here, pay attention to the subtle details. This is a truly great movie. Great acting from Waltz. And hopefully will be thought provoking, about work, overbearing bosses, omnipresent media companies and the meaning of life...

I loved the sun in the sky at the end!

Neither I, nor my friends or family are of a lower level of consciousness that cant conceive of the beauty, depth or complexity of amazingly mind blowing movies, this is just not one of them!  The vibe of the film is so on edge, at every moment, it may cause heart palpitations, but visually I can say its well done although still slightly uncomfortable to look at. You really keep hoping, and holding on, fighting the heaviness in your eyes, praying that it gets deeper, or more substantial or awe inspiring, it doesn't, what you see in the first 20 mins continues to the end. People may try to write these reviews because they are under the impression that if people think you understand a sugar coated turd of a film such as this, that psuedo-intelectual yuppies may invite you to have a glass of crappy expensive wine with them, this is not the case, or maybe it is and you'll still want to chew off your finger either way.  I've never written a review before this one, but thought if I could keep even one person from wasting as much precious time and life force watching this as I did, that maybe one of you might spend that time doing something productive, like making love or taking drugs. The end.",1414627200,6,1335,4.463114754098361
6289384,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"I very much enjoyed this film.  I was not sure what to expect.  Recalling Terry Gilliam as a member of Monte Python, I thought it might be comedic.  Reading that Christopher Waltz, when he does movies for an American audience, has generally seemed to do violent or ""bad"" characters didn't help.  Other characters, except Matt Damon (looking amazingly like Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""Capote""), were completely unfamiliar to me.  And I did not watch this as a ""fan of Terry Gilliam films"" since it appears, I have not watched his other films.

The movie is set in an inteterminate future on earth.  A large, technologically centered corporation (Mancorp) is working on artificial intelligence and other advanced programs.  Irony certainly is visible, as for example the head of the corporation, played by Matt Damon, is simply called ""Management"".

The central figure is Waltz's character, Qohen Leth, a socially impaired but talented programmer who crunches ""not numbers--ENTITIES--their behavior is much more complex than numbers"".  Due to his agoraphobia he requests disability, or in the alternative, to be allowed to work from home.

His supervisor Joby invites him to a party and says he thinks he can set up a meeting with Management there.  Reluctantly Qohen attends, and meets at least one other main figure: Bainsley, played by Melanie Thierry.  This appears a casual encounter, but she pursues him somewhat doggedly, setting up one of many questions in the film: is she merely another hired employee assigned by Management to help Qohen in his new and daunting assignment: attempting to prove the ""Zero Theorem"", or is she actually attracted to him, based on her own personal needs?

The Zero Theorem seems to combine ideas from contemporary physics and metaphysical ideas into one: that the sum total of all matter and energy in the physical universe is zero, and that the universe HAS no (or at least does not need to have) any meaning whatsoever.

Gilliam's ideas for computized work in the future have a very organic look about them: new assignments are handed out in brightly colored vials.  Completed assignments are uploaded back to Headquarters in similar vials.  The design for an advanced central computer, strangely, was based on an old Rumanian metal smelter.  It was decided the real thing was too hazardous, but much of the look was preserved, including the look of a ponderous heavy metallic central core.

One other important character should be mentioned: Lucas Hedges, Management's young son known as ""Bob"" because he refers to everyone else as ""Bob"", not wanting to waste his time remembering names  Bob too begins hanging out with Qohen, and a similar ambiguity exists: to what degree is he doing it only to advance his father's desire to prove this theorem, and to what degree is it because he sees some kindred brilliance and non-conformity in Qohen?  [All youth of course go through some type of nonconformist phase, but Qohen seems to have remained this feature well into adult life]

There's interesting content from the ""bonus features"" on the Blu-Ray/DVD combo, though it was overly-long and I wished it discussed concepts more than how they made the movie.  For example they compare it to ""A Clockwork Orange"" in that the costumes look futuristic, but are likely still to look futuristic 100 years from now, because they still won't be in style.  Almost everyone is dressed in bright and unique colors (like the inhabitants of the central city in the Hunger Games) except for Qohen, whose color palette is almost entirely black.

Qohen lives in an abandoned, half-ruined ancient monastery (in keeping with the semi-religious tone of the questions asked about the universe) and again there is a touch of irony as he explains to Bainsley that the inhabitants took vows of ""chastity, poverty and silence.  Apparently the silence included not yelling ""Fire!"" when a fire broke out....""

Halfway through the film Bob convinces Qohen to leave his refuge and go outside to the park with him.  There they sit on two end seats of a 3-seat bench.  This seems metaphorically perfect: there is one person missing, and the question for Qohen is: in which direction is he going to turn for the missing third person: someone who will help him find meaning within this universe, or someone who will help him view it as meaningless?

That obviously seems the central question of the film, and I think the film finds its answer [which I will not spoil by explaining].  Along the way there is superb acting, superb cinematography, superb imagery, and an engaging, if slightly cryptic script.  If you enjoy films strong on imagery and short on tidy answers; if you enjoy films slightly like a trip to a museum of modern art, you should enjoy this film.  I consider it one of the best I've seen in the past 12 months.  There's a lot more in it to see.",1414540800,2,4867,4.924019607843137

6289407,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"This appears to me to be a study of the psychological process toward what Jung called individuation. The main character starts out by referring to himself in the plural, and over the course of the story eventually arrives at the singular when he accepts the inherent chaos that defines a life lived fully in the here and now. All of the other characters are facets of his psyche that help and hinder his transformation.

SPOILERS

Read up on Jung's dream interpretation of the house with many rooms, clearly depicted during the party scenes where he stumbles upon different parts of himself. His anima saves him, more than once, including via a baptism. Management - Everything is under control. 'Nuff said. His supervisor, who can't get his name right, is eventually fired - possibly symbolic of a complex that is resolved. ""I know who you are, Leth, do you?"" Bob, his inner child, has been sick for a long time. I suppose Qohen is the ego, and therefore doesn't physically exist at all either, and the entire story is taking place in the mind of a person we never even see.

To avoid spoiling it for anyone who hasn't watched it yet, I won't say who states the thesis out loud:

""The saddest aspect of mankind's need to believe in a god, or, to put it another way, a purpose greater than this life, is that it makes this life meaningless. You see, this is all just a way-station on the road to some promised eternity.""

Lots of other insights and inside jokes. ""Mild winter takes toll on tall Afghan children."" is one of the news tickers running alongside the buildings. WTF? Well worth watching several times with the 'pause' button in hand.",1412985600,7,1644,4.616438356164384

6289423,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"I was skeptical about this movie.  From the trailer and things I'd read, I didn't expect it to be my kind of movie.  I was so wrong.  It's a touching story of a lonely man, Qohen, who is afraid to feel anything.  He even refuses to eat food that has flavor.  He's spent the majority of his life waiting for a phone call that will finally answer all his questions and give meaning to his otherwise meaningless life.  He works, he eats and he sleeps.  He doesn't want to leave his bleak home (a burned out former monastery) to go to work so he requests to go on disability so he can work from home.  Management decides to grant his wish and put him on a special project, to prove the Zero Theorem, which in effect will prove that everything is equal to nothing.  He is driving himself crazy in an effort to prove the theorem but his process is interrupted by a woman and a teenage boy  who together begin to open Qohen's mind to the possibility of more than his mundane existence.
At one point, Management played by Matt Damon, tells Qohen that he's worked and waited his whole life for a phone call to give his life meaning and thereby he's ended up living a meaningless life. It's a scenario that is familiar to so many people in today's society.  The representation of a surveillance society where 'Management' watches every move and advertisements follow you down the street is rather frightening in the imminenent possibility of its existence in the very near future.  The symbolism within the film is sometimes subtle and sometimes completely overt.  For example, a crucifix in Qohen's apartment has a surveillance camera in place of Jesus's head.  This is definitely a thought provoking film, as Terry Gilliam's movies always are, but it's also a sweet and hopeful movie.  If you're on the fence, as I was, about seeing this, please don't hesitate any longer. It's a movie that will change how you view the world just a tiny bit and it's one that you won't soon forget.",1412553600,4,1974,4.536723163841808

The movie is almost a pure scene-by-scene re-make of Brazil but updated with a fractal, quantum computer instead of rows and rows of file cabinets full of paper.  The movie is brilliant with first rate casting and actually cutting-edge mathematical meandering (Nassim Haramein The Fractal-Holographic Universe theories) make this a satisfying romp. A reference to the Matrix and NSA-type camera placed in the decapitated stature of Christ on the cross creates brilliant imagery. But, somebody forgot how to end such a complex move.

6289445,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"The film was visually stunning in Gilliam's typical bizarre and surreal manner. Waltz gave a great performance, but his character just wasn't interesting enough to warrant so much screentime. We understand his quirks and choices, but he we never understand Qohen Leth himself. We never relate to the characters.

But the cast is impressive, boasting David Thewlis, Tilda Swinton, the incredibly talented young Lucas Hedges, Matt Damon, Ben Whishaw, and Peter Stormare, all of whom play characters that should have been onscreen more. Gilliam also cripples himself by designing a visually stunning, interesting, immersive world in the first third, and then completely throwing it aside for the rest of the movie. For a movie that has ads for The Holy Church of Batman the Redeemer, we really see too much of Qohen's strange church. Great set design it is, but it gets boring.

Lastly, there's no emotional impact. The characters never feel real. And Gilliam keeps on repeating his points ad nauseum, but never really brings them about, makes us understand, care, or believe in them. For a film so densely written, it can be really shallow.

This is not to say its a bad movie. Its not. Waltz really gives a great performance, and when he has a chance to really chew the scenery, it's stunning. The Zero Theorem is not about everything is nothing, its about a man learning how to live while at the same time searching for meaning in nothingness and absurdity. The score is great, I loved the set design and the cinematography, and when it wanted to, it could be funny or moving or sad, or even awe-inspiring. Its a pity the majority is just...rather dull.

We don't know what Gilliam's trying to say. Or if we do, he never says it. For such a great filmmaker, this movie really should have been better. Gilliam isn't erring on the side of caution, and that makes his failure all the sadder. For such a quirky, daring subject, the pacing and middle half is really kind of meh... But if you're a Gilliam fan, this will be fine candy. If you're a fan of quirky, heady, dystopian, bizarre, adult science fiction, then man this is the film for you!

6289454,5,B00IRD8JJ6,FREAKING AMAZING!!!!,1411603200,,20,9.5
6289455,2,B00IRD8JJ6,"For Terry Gilliam it's been thirty years since his seminal work, Brazil, the first part of his loose ""Orwellian Triptych"", and in that time he's made it tough to remain a fan. Many of his films carry a similar visual razzle-dazzle, part steampunk and part carnival funhouse mirror, while imagining some government-controlled future dystopia. We've seen it all before from others and many times by Gilliam himself, and sadly his latest film TheZero Theorem is just more of the same, only it makes less sense.

Two-time Oscar winner Christoph Waltz takes an odd detour as Qohen Leth, a bald-headed reclusive computer programmer who ""crunches"" data for Mancorp, some monolithic corporation that seems to control everything. It's putting it mildly to say that Qohen isn't much of a people person. He's a jittery, barely-audible introvert of epic proportions, obsessed with learning the meaning of his life. He's so consumed with it that he waits patiently by the phone thinking someone will soon call him with the answer, and this being a Gilliam film it may very well happen. Qohen just wants to be left alone to wait for his call and do his work, but distractions arise after Management (Matt Damon in an expanded cameo) assign him to solve the ""zero theorem"", a math equation that proves life is meaningless. Something like would be enough to drive a person mad, but he gets help from a gorgeous call girl Bainsley (Melanie Thierry), Management's son (Lucas Hedges), a pesky computer psychologist (Tilda Swinton), and Qohen's boss (David Thewlis). They don't help him crack the numbers, per se, but to maintain his fragile sanity.

Much of the film is set inside Qohen's home, a church of great visual splendor but it's nothing compared to the chaos of the outside world. Gilliam imagines a marketing nightmare-reality where commercials (featuring the likenesses of Gwendoline Christie, Lily Cole, and Rupert Friend) literally follow your every move. It's typical Gilliam and his fans will love the splendor of it, but the mechanics of the world are surprisingly vague. The focus is instead on Qohen and his quest for the meaning of life, which amounts to him having visions of black holes and punching keys on a keyboard. It's not terribly exciting, nor does screenwriter Pat Rushin have an original thought to put in Qohen's head. We recognize his existential angst but never fully understand it; the marvelous imagery proving a worthy distraction from a ho-hum plot. Waltz isn't bad but his jittery Buddha routine comes off as too practiced, like he's trying hard to act how a Gilliam character should act. The same goes for much of the cast who pop in and out with a splash but little impact. Only the effervescent Thierry, in her array of colorful outfits and hairstyles, manages to liven things up every time she appears. Yeah, she's something of a twirling pixie (women aren't represented well at all, by the way) but at least she's having fun and by extension we want her around as much as possible.

The Zero Theorem has a pretty big riddle at its center, but the one problem it can't solve is how to get Gilliam on the right track. It tries hard to emulate the director's most cherished films when setting out on a fresh course would have been the right answer.",1411603200,,3270,4.867145421903052
6289456,4,B00IRD8JJ6,"Not Gilliam's best work, but enjoyable nonetheless.  This film gives us a glimpse of a Dystopian world dually shaped by blatant consumerism and individual's corporation-backed attempt at finding an answer to an existential question that has baffled mankind for eons.

The worst is how the movie aims to be something deeply and divine - the meaning of the universe! - but cannot formulate any coherent thoughts while spewing out metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. This thing is a bad first draft turned into finished film, the broken and incomplete thoughts of a rambling lunatic. While there are moments intended to be humorous, smart or touching, those parts just come off as weak, stupid and unsympathetic. There is a darkness to this world that's supposed to be ""black comedy"" that is simply just ugly and depressing. Christolph Waltz is a surly, mumbling grouch whom you're supposed to somehow sympathize with and root for, yet only does a great job of making you loath his misanthropic presence throughout the film.

I even like the director's recent ""misfires"" like ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" or ""Brothers Grimm."" But this abomination makes either of those look like ""12 Monkeys"" or ""Brazil"" by comparison.

6289470,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"Qohen Leth (Waltz) is a reclusive computer programmer working on the zero theorem, a theory that all existence is meaningless and nothing is connected. This film fits in perfectly with Gilliam's other future films Brazil and 12 Monkeys and I can comfortably say this is Gilliam's finest film since 1985s aforementioned Brazil. While the film is dealing with the meaning of life and existence its never heavy handed and is often quite funny. Familiar themes from other Gilliam films like big brother, government and madness are all explored but he clearly was thinking about technology with this outing.

During the opening sequence Qohen is bombarded by advertising while walking to work. A moving video billboard mentions a promotion called ""Occupy Mall Street"" and while this is clearly satire its sadly not that far off from our current reality. Most of the satire in the film is rooted in our overall relationship with technology, from the way characters in the film are all wearing ear buds to how people at a ""party"" all carry iPads. We are shown a reality that plays closer to an actual mirror than an exaggerated self image. Clearly Gilliam is asking us to disengage from our distractions and engage with our surroundings.

Bob (Hedges) a 15 year old programming prodigy helps Qohen to interact with the outside world and find meaning in his life or at the very least he begins to open up to the possibility of experiencing the world outside of his job and home. Bainsley (Thierry) is a woman Qohen meets at a party and shows immediate interest in him. She  Bob and Bainsley act as agents of change, both characters represent opposing sides of the same idea. Both want him to connect to a world outside of himself but Bob encourages him to go physically outside and Bainsly wants him to connect through a computer. She says ""It's better than real. You're in your computer and I'm in mine. We're connected by memory chips and fiber optics. We're safe here""

Most films about the existential questions in life are somewhat dense and academic in their approach but this is a film by Terry Gilliam so its really only fair to compare him to his previous work. Gilliam's films are always stunning to look at but sometimes his subjects are not worthy of the beauty he surrounds them with. This is not one of those films. This is classic Gilliam where both the story and the setting are deserving of one another. That symmetry that few film makers can achieve the way he does.",1410825600,2,2476,4.737819025522041

6289493,5,B00IRD8JJ6,"Terry Gilliam strikes again with this superb plot. A hacker awaits for a call phone that may become the highway for the promised land. Meanwhile he has to deal with an imposed task: to discover what's behind the zero theorem.

The script is filled of the black humor, double sense jokes and multiple visual references you may expect from this marvelous filmmaker.

But as it happened in Brazil, this is a film of films. Gilliam pays tribute to another films of the past, such as the hammer hits on the phone recalls you to the murder by the bond of the ape on its victim in 2001, the Big Brother from 1984, Stars wars, the horrid atmosphere in which the humanity lives or -survives- bringing us back the spectral nights of Blade Runner, Vertigo on a key sequence, even Fellini's Rome is cited (the casual encounter with two nuns).

Christopher gives an amazing performance as Leth Quohen, the disturbed and desperated being, searching without hope the fundaments of the theorem. The cinematography and travellings are a trademark as it must be in Gilliam films.

To intend compare this entry with Brazil is not a fair game. This is another aspect of the quest. But you will find more than one issue to comment and remark once the last image dissapears before your eyes.

Watch and purchase it without blinking.

6289497,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"THE ZERO THEOREM is pretty much what one would expect from Terry Gilliam, and for the most part it works. Gilliam is one of the most visually interesting directors working today, and his style is very dream-like, quirky and (occasionally) drug-influenced. He also tackles some very existential and weighty themes about the meaning of life and whether or not there is an overall purpose to our existence. Still, the narrative does wander a bit in the middle and there is no grandiose revelation at the end, giving what the film seemed to be building up to. It was an adequate resolution, but not the one I was hoping for. Still, there is much to admire this film for, especially Gilliam fans. Christoph Waltz steals the show as the main character, Qohen Leth. There are also excellent supporting turns by Melanie Thierry and David Thewlis. On top of that, there are a couple of cameos (one of them, blink and you'll miss it) that were pleasant to see, and which added depth to what was already an ambitious film. In my opinion, this isn't Terry Gilliam's greatest work, but it does remind me of BRAZIL which isn't the worst comparison to have (by far).

6289504,2,B00IRD8JJ6,"I was very interested in the premise of the film. This is about a computer programmer in some alternate universe (or the not too distant future) who gets an order from his boss to write a program proving that life has no meaning. His intuition tells him that life does have meaning and he is certain that a call from his boss (a god-like character named The Management) would have revealed it to him if it were not for his accidentally hanging up the phone as the revelation was about to be revealed. Later he finds out that this episode was just a hallucination. He also finds out that a woman that has taken an interest in him and for whom he had fallen in love was really just a prostitute paid to give him companionship.

Like I said, really interesting stuff as for the basic premise and Terry Gilliam has done some great work in the past (such as directing one of my favorite sci-fi movies Twelves Monkeys). But it seems that this film was a little clumsily done. It lacked an edge and had some flat characters, ones you don't identify with and fall for. The dialogue and the scenes are a little stilted. I also thought the ending rather odd and lacking character, perhaps even slightly cliche (it ended on a tropical beach with the lead character looking over a sunset).

It had a lot of potential but I don't think this was that entertaining and well-put-together a film. I hope that the film will get remade later with a script rewrite.",1409529600,,1445,4.449056603773585

6289511,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"Yes, this is a bad, dull movie. Gilliam is trying to make sense of the hyper-drive techno age of the present moment and failing to find anything profound in his critique. Yes, it's a failure, but is it really his failure, or is it rather the failure of this moment in history to supply even the basis for an attack or a critical perspective. Perhaps art cannot comment interestingly on something so inherently boring and soulless. We really do live in a time of unprecedented stupidity, ignorance, and addiction to the corporate-controlled glowing screen (such as the one I'm writing this on and you're reading it on - some human connection, huh?!) and maybe there's really not much to say about this condition besides that it's rendered people distinctly less-than-human. Perhaps in a future age, when the system has crashed and a few people live on the islands that remain amidst the debris, someone will have something worthwhile to say again. Till then, I'm sticking with art made when people still learned a craft and had a world worth engaging with. Read a book, damn it! And make sure it's an old one!",1409443200,4,1108,4.746113989637306

6289515,3,B00IRD8JJ6,"IMO, a mediocre Gilliam film is better than most other ""pretty good"" films. Sadly, this is the case here. It seems like he tries to recapture some of the magic of Brazil and repackage it in the internet age. Many of his trademark visuals are here, at least for the first half of the film. But the main character retreats into his church/house and the scenery is mostly the same thereafter. Although the satire in Brazil was powerful and interesting, here it comes off as a bit heavy handed and uninspired. A quirky character's search for the ultimate meaning in life never really intrigues, as one hopes. I read Gilliam made this film in one year, whereas he states that typically his films take close to three. This really shows in The Zero Theorem and the result is disappointing in the end, especially when one has the talented actors - Chris Waltz chief among them - that never really have a chance to take us anywhere special.",1409270400,4,931,4.580838323353293

If you are the type of person who likes to get high on psychedelics or delve into deep, philosophical stuff, this movie is fertile ground for as many discussions as you can handle. Also, I'd recommend watching this movie at least twice within the same 24 hour period, but perhaps not back-to-back, as it yields further symbols on subsequent viewings. For example, if we examine how the main character persists in telling people how to spell his name: ""Q, no u, o-h-e-n"" It isn't until later in the movie that another character begins to refer to Qohen as simply ""Q"" - when watched again, taking into account the possibility that Qohen may be the only ""real"" person in the story, the first part of his spelling out of his name could be rendered ""Q, no you..."" because you don't exist.

Though the plot concerns the quest to solve the meaning of life (as calculated by an unattainable mathematical theorem), Gilliam is not dangling any solutions; he basks in the Kafkaesque farces of peoples struggling to fight authority and attain dream-like freedom.  If you think that echoes Gilliams brilliant 1985 masterpiece Brazil, it does; The Zero Theorem is Brazil-lite, but what keeps it fresh is Gilliams amazing visual design, filled with sight gags and sly references, and the joy of watching some terrific actors let loose in total caricatures that inhabit a surreal cityscape.

Christophe Waltz (Inglorious Basterds, 12 Years a Slave) is Qohen Leth, a quirky loner and possible savant who works as a programmer for Mancom (the big bad authoritarian company).  His only hope in life is that he will receive a phone call that will bring him total salvation; until then, he works adamantly at his computer to crunch entities via a massive virtual world in which he connects mathematical proofs as if playing a video game.  Management (personified by an artfully costumed Matt Damon) has an eye on himmany, in factbecause they think he has the potential to solve the Zero Theorem.  Qohen is examined by 3 virtual doctors (Peter Stormare, Ben Wishaw, and Sanjeev Bhaskar), and is assigned a virtual therapist, Dr. Shrink-Rom (another whacky prosthetic turn from Tilda Swinton, who we last saw practicing prosthetic comedy in Snowpiercer).  His boss (David Thewlis) is charged with keeping him on task, so he sends a stripper (Melanie Thierry) to befriend him, assumably as a stress-relief measure.  She succeeds in bringing his humanity (and desire) back, and as Managements son (a very fun Lucas Hedges from Grand Budapest Hotel) also worms his way into Qohens private  world (he lives in an old, grand church, decorated as if Pee Wee Herman were into Steampunk), he starts to wonder just who to trust.

Toss aside the meaningless plot and revel in the visual circus Gilliam assembles; there is his trademark labyrinthine machinery with plenty of patchy ductwork, hilarious props in the background, brand satires, and of course, a dwarf.  Add the creepiest use of a version of Radioheads song Creep into the mix, and you have classic Gilliam.  Few directors make bleakness and cynicism so much fun.

CLICHES:  the whole meaning of life thing is a bit theatrical and trite, even in satire
SURPRISES: sight gags (signs in the city, products laying around) are sometimes more entertaining than the film; this will be fun to search for hidden treasures when the BluRay comes out

Qohen Leth (Christoph Waltz) is a computer genius, who has been assigned by Management to discover the meaning of life. He does this alone in an old abandoned church. This movie made absolutely no sense to the point where I don't even know how the hell to describe it in any way that would do it justice. Waltz is running around like a madman the entire time, talking so fast, with that accent, that he's impossible to understand. He meets Tilda Swinton at some type of party, and she keeps showing up for some unknown reason, personally I just think it's because she's weird and she likes being in weird movies. Waltz has all these odd computer programs, strange characters he interacts with and talks non-sense with, all in a film that moves faster than his internet connection. I really just didn't understand a thing that was going on and watching it a number of times or doing any amount of any drug in the world wouldn't change that. How is a solitary man playing strange computer games supposed to discover the meaning of life? Who are all these people who keep showing up? What in the hell are they talking about, and what does anything have to do with anything?
