6936294,4,B00RWKN7O2,"I rate this double feature at 4 stars. The reason for it is that Up to His Ears (1965) is weaker than That Man from Rio (1964).  Truth be told, I only enjoyed watching the first film. I almost fell asleep watching the second one  The two films starting French superstar Jean-Paul Belmondo are adventure comedies along the lines Indiana Jones meets Pink Panther.

That Man From Rio, was filmed on site in Brazil. The beginning of the film was shot in Paris, France.  The film is about a young woman played by Francoise Dorleac, whose father has passed away and she is put in care of her uncle.  The girl's father, who was an anthropologist, once with a group of his colleagues unearthed in Amazonian forest three mysterious statutes that belonged to extinct indigenous tribe.  The statutes hold a powerful secret and certain group of people wants to have them in their possession.  Belmondo plays the girl's boyfriend who is on leave from the army.  When the girl gets kidnapped, Belmondo hitches a plane ride to Brazil to find her and rescue her...he does not know what adventure he is in for.  Francoise Dorleac, who plays key female role in the film, was the older sister of the famous French star Catherine Deneuve.  Francoise died in a tragic car accident in 1967, she was 25 years old.

Up to His Ears, entirely filmed in Asia (Malaysia, China, India, and Nepal) revolves around a rich guy Arthur (Belmondo) who lives on a lavish boat together with his loyal butler, Chinese psychic, fianc, and soon to be mother-in-law with her boyfriend. Arthur is unhappy with his life, and he wants to kill himself. The mother-in-law is in favor of him killing himself so that she can inherit all the money with her daughter.  She is willing do anything to make Arthur disappear.  However, in the way of  her plan stands the Chinese psychic, the loyal butler, two goofy undercover life-insurance agents, and a newly acquainted strip-tease dancer played by the sex symbol of the 1960's (according to me) Ursula Andress.  If you find goofy/lame humor funny than you will like this film...the only other thing worth mentioning are the numerous stunts and acrobatics towards the end of the film.  I found the last 25 minutes of the film most interesting to watch...especially seeing Ursula in bikini on a tropical island is a feast for eyes...say what you want about her acting...one thing is for sure: she was a woman of tremendous beauty, equal to Sophie Loren, Marisa Mell or Monica Vitti.  Speaking of Ursula Andress, not many people know but Belmondo and Andress had an affair when they met on the set of the film.  The romance was widely publicized at the time in France, and consequently cost Belmondo his marriage (Belmondo at the time was married to Elodie Constantin with whom he had 3 children).  I guess Belmondo was love-struck :)  but who wouldn't be seeing Ursula in the prime of her life?",1430438400,12,2892,4.711729622266402
6936295,5,B00RWKN7O2,"That Man From Rio is a terrific movie, and I really enjoyed seeing Up To His Ears again, even though it's not quite as good (although the stunts are incredible).",1429747200,4,161,4.4
6936296,5,B00RWKN7O2,"I'm so glad I can get this film soon.  I like the time period it was made in, but I mainly wanted to see this because Francoise Dorleac is one of the actors in this film. If you don't know who she is, Francoise is the {deceased} sister of Catherine Deneuve.  She died at age 25  in a tragic car accident in 1967, after having spent the day at a beach with Catherine.",1425772800,4,366,3.9863013698630136

6936299,5,B00RWKN7O2,"One of my all-time favorite movies.  The transfer is very nice, if a little too green.  De Broca is in his element here as are Belmondo and Dorleac - it's a lark and brilliantly done, with a great score by Georges Delerue.  My only tiny caveat is that they didn't include the English dub done for the US - it's not wonderful or anything, but Belmondo is voiced by Hal Linden and that's fun.",1444089600,2,390,4.243243243243243

6936301,5,B00RWKN7O2,"THAT MAN FROM RIO is a genuine gem! UP TO HIS EARS is silly fun. Great set if you can get it at a discounted price.
Both films look and sound great for their age.",1442102400,,162,3.657142857142857
6936302,4,B00RWKN7O2,"That Man from Rio is a great adventure film, Up to His Ears much, much less so.  But the package arrived punctually and in excellent condition.",1436400000,,143,4.5
6936303,4,B00RWKN7O2,"I've loved ""That Man from Rio"" ever since seeing the original when it first came out... a juicy spoof of adventure movies featuring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Francoise Dorleac (Catherine Deneuve's sister, sadly killed young in an auto accident) and scenes shot in Paris, Rio, and the just-being-built futuristic city of Brasilia. Plot is predictably silly, but oh, what action! Color restoration has been well-done.

I never saw or heard of Up to His Ears before this video, which stars Belmondo up aagainst Ursula Andress. The plot is even more lightweight than that of That Man From Rio, but it likewise features exotic locations (China, et al) and amazing stunts. Good fun!",1434067200,5,673,5.063063063063063

6936305,5,B00RWKN7O2,"Tops in every way. Hilarious, non-stop adventure. Plus, this is a superb Blu-Ray edition. Well worth having and enjoying over and over. And Belmondo is absolutely terrific. It's great having both films in one package.",1432080000,,217,5.228571428571429
6936306,3,B00RWKN7O2,"While there is some magic in this 1960's film, it didn't really live up to my father's memories of it from the 1960's when it came out.  It is goofy, exhuberent nonsense acted and filmed beautifully but viewed through a modern lense, the story wanders and alot of the novelty looks dated.  For the price paid, it certainly needs",1431907200,,328,4.5423728813559325

8696121,3,B00RWKN7O2,"This is a parody of the Bond movies of the sixties, though it is not a spy film.  Belmondo does a fair job of playing the put upon millionaire that is chased or chases the bad guys all over the world.  (These bad guys turning up not to be so bad.)
We get to hear Ursula Andres speak French in this spoof.",1528675200,,304,3.8870967741935485
8696122,5,B00RWKN7O2,That Man From RIO is my favorite movie with Franoise Dorleac. Bebel (Jean-Paul's nickname in France) is wonderful. This edition provides a beautiful picture for a 60's hit.,1506643200,,172,5.178571428571429

8696124,5,B00RWKN7O2,"L'homme de Rio (That Man from Rio, from 1964, and directed by Phillippe de Broca), is one of my favorite films of all time! Ever since I first saw it as a kid, its sounds and images have always stayed with me. This is by far one of the best spoofs and homage to the whole adventure/spy/mystery/thriller genre ever made, played up with a lot of comic turns and other sophisticated and clever nuances thrown-in.

Jean-Paul Belmondo is absolutely fantastic, this is the ""cinematic character"" he's been more associated with, and the one that made him a certified international superstar. The ravishingly beautiful Franoise Dorl&eacute;ac (Catherine Deneuve's sister), was also perfectly suited in her role, as was Jean Servais and Adolfo Celi. And, I can't leave out the unforgettable and talented young Brazilian boy that was Ubiracy De Oliveira, AKA 'Sir Winston'.

Today's action/adventure movies, for all their CGI and other technological gimmicks and trickery, pale in comparison to a film that had none of that nonsense at its disposal. The cinematography byEdmond S&eacute;chan, the music of Georges Delerue all equally make this an unforgettable film experience.

The DVD picture and sound quality is pure perfection (this DVD release is from 2015). The Cohen Media Group has restored this film to a pristine state. NTSC format, French (English subtitles), extras, NR 112 mins.

The second feature in this collection: Les tribulations d'un Chinois en Chine (for this release it's been retitled; Up to His Ears, which from 1965, and was also directed by Phillippe de Broca), was supposed to be an unofficial sequel/follow-up to L'homme de Rio. However, the only thing they have in common is the action/adventure theme, but the characters are not the same ones.

Here, Belmondo plays a bored billionaire looking to end his life, until he meets and encounters the radiant beauty of 'Alexandrine' (Ursula Andress). The film, like its predecessor, was shot almost entirely on location. In this case: Hong Kong, India, Nepal, and Langkawi Island, Malaysia. This one too is filled with non-stop action, chases, and stunts. However, unlike L'homme de Rio, this film had a much more surreal, silly, and comic-book element, than its predecessor ever did. But, its still fun to watch, especially for Ursula Andress.

The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent, the film has also been completely restored by the Cohen Media Group. NTSC format, French (English subtitles), extras, NR 104 mins. (BTW: one hopes that the Cohen Media Group also restores and releases other Phillippe de Broca gems like: Cartouche, Le magnifique, and Tendre poulet.)

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1493856000,2,2671,5.168981481481482
8696125,5,B00RWKN7O2,"THAT MAN FROM RIO was BELMONDO and director DE BROCA's second movie after CARTOUCHE.It's hard to think of a more physical role for an actor. In this film,BELMONDO started to make stunts under the guidance of GIL DELAMARE.We all know that SPIELBERG was inspired by this film while making RAIDERS OF A LOST ARK.One imagine the difficulty of making a movie in RIO in 1964. BELMONDO is ideally cast and DORLAC(who was CATHERINE DENEUVE's sister) was a perfect match. As for UP TO HIS EARS,even director DE BROCA admitted that it wasn't one of his best. It was almost the same crew: producer,director,writers,composer and leading man, but the overall feeling after viewing is not as concluant. The restoration of both films are examplary. You've got the original french audio with english subtitles and even some extras. Congratulations to COHEN for making these films available.",1469145600,2,874,5.076388888888889

8696127,5,B00RWKN7O2,How awesome is this to see both films in the one DVD presentation? That Man from Rio is a fast-moving action films with lots of exciting set-pieces. The follow-up Up to His Ears (which I originally saw under the title Chinese Adventures in China) is great fun and based on a Jules Verne novel. Both films are loads of action and fun and a few laughs. Something of a send-up of spy films popular in the 1960s.,1464652800,,408,4.311688311688312
