If you like the Arts, you will probably enjoy this. I'm trying hard not to give away any of this treasure, suffice it to say that brother and sister are torn apart. The brother to the Golden Dragon, the sister is tricked into the shadow dragon and the dark side. I think you get the point. Enjoy!!!",1259020800,,467,4.258426966292135
