417180,4,6302036763,"This one's got that whole late 70's/early 80's cringe inducing wardrobe vibe, and quite possibly the all-time worst of the many Shatner toupees.  Still, it's an absorbing little melodrama, and if all you've ever seen William Shatner do is sexy-cool Captain Kirk or quirky-cool Denny Crane, this will be a revelation for you.  Here he plays a sad-sack everyman; a typical suburban middle class loser: and very well, too.",1192665600,6,419,5.057971014492754
417181,2,6302036763,"Actually this movie feels like it was sponsored by some Government agency or a Church organization. All the characters act ""by the book"", so to speak. The male lead is too naive and too guilt ridden to be in any way entertaining. The message that might be of some interest is that sexual attraction is often triggered not by a specific person but by circumstances or specific settinge (but that's hardly news, I guess). Unfortunately, that alone does not make a good story. The fact that the wife on whom the main character cheats is by far the most attractive female in the whole movie does not help either.",1185667200,,608,4.587155963302752
417182,4,6302036763,"Capably crafted from beginning to end, this melodrama, with alternate titles of TRICK EYES and PORTRAIT OF A JOHN, is an Italian/U.S. co-production made for television, and will please those viewers responsive to interesting cinema.  Christopher Jordan (William Shatner), an aeronautical engineer, is becoming restive due to a frustrating home life with an attractive wife, Katie (Michelle Phillips), toward whom he has become sexually indifferent (increasingly problematic since he dwells upon past intimacy), and with three lively and demanding offspring.  Although Jordan wishes to keep intact their 12 year marriage, he is artless and inexperienced and begins to savour the possibilities of having assignations with street walking prostitutes.  His fantasies become fact, but after some close scrapes, one with venereal disease, another with a police vice sting, Jordan ceases his clandestine copulation, albeit the marital incompatibility continues.  While shopping in a lingerie store to find something fetching that could repair the cracked relationship with his spouse, Chris is boldly approached by an ostensibly stringless call girl, Elaine (Cybill Shepherd).  Vulnerable Christopher quickly becomes more emotionally attached to Elaine than is wise for his general welfare, and he becomes adrift between a respectable domestic existence and an affair of lust that has a potential of becoming something larger.  However, Elaine might not be as agreeable a person as she initially appears to be, and Jordan finds himself spiralling into a distressed state.  Eventually, due to his hidden relationship with Elaine, Chris is in danger of losing all else that is important to him, and he is forced to make desperate choices.  Perfectly paced by competent director William A. Graham, the film additionally benefits from skillful acting, Shepherd a standout as an apparently conflicted lady of the evening, while Phillips earns the performing laurels here with her nuanced reading as Katie.  Attention to detail is remarkable throughout, important in the development of a strong sense of realism in the face of sleazy happenings as a well-scripted story by Dennis Nemec serves as aid to Graham, providing arresting characters for Graham to deploy without serious lapses in credibility and logic. Editor Ronald Fagan seamlessly polishes the work that is set and shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, and scoring from Mark Snow is consistently appropriate.  Congratulations are in order for the entire crew, as well, an exceptional impartment coming from costumer Robert Turturice who adroitly marries the very fair Shepherd with suitable apparel as shifts in her personality occur, this but one example of an unusual amount of care that is taken during the patterning of this too-little known film.",1120953600,12,2799,5.549295774647887

7820029,3,6302036763,"Worth watching for Michelle Philips' performance alone.  Besides resembling a goddess, her acting carried the movie.  Michelle made you wonder why her husband (Captain Kirk) would be interested in even looking at other women, especially those who were only interested in ""business relationships"".  ""It is not logical, Captain.""  Cybill Shepherd gave a convincing performance as a high-rent ""business woman"", but the sleaze was rather designer sleaze as if it were filmed for Hallmark Channel.",1461801600,,492,5.608108108108108

7820034,5,6302036763,"The movie is very well made. William Shatner plays a middle aged middle income group family man who is bored with his mundane life and is somehow drawn towards having sex with prostitutes. The consequences of this are shown to be bad in this movie.
Willam Shatner plays a different kind of role in this movie and has done it very well. The movie not an action movie, it is a drama and is well paced for a drama.",1333843200,,411,4.215189873417722
7820035,3,6302036763,"William SHatner and Cybil Sheppard in this made-for-tv movie were somewhat dynamic even if the story was simple and somewhat trite.

Popular topics in the late 70's and early 80's were divorces and extra marital affairs.

However - the dynamic of Michelle Phillips and Cybil Sheepard once they each find out about William Shatners (Captina Kirk) extra 'activities' is melodramatic - in the best sort of way - to watch.

Very period clothing and hairstyles and basic story, the movie is defiantely one look at how we used to think of infidelity.

I enjoyed it for what it was.  3-26-09",1238025600,,584,4.8
7820036,5,6302036763,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-Of-A-Married-Man/dp/B00008W2SL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets Of A Married Man</a>&nbsp;This is one of my favorite ""made-for-TV"" movies!  Take a break from Captain Kirk and enjoy this very well-acted, but stark look at the reality of infidelity.  Shatner plays a man whose marriage has started to turn rather lack luster, or should I just say lacks lust.  While his wife is busy with the kids and her own ambitions, he takes a drive in the red light district and gets more than he bargained for.  Oh no, this is not your usual prostitute; she is beautiful, has a nice apartment, never rushes, and speaks in soothing tones.  But, like a rose, this prostitute has a thorn.  Her pimp!  As Shatner's addiction grows, so does this pimp's greed.  Has Shatner become too attached?  Maybe too emotionally attached?  Perhaps Mr. Spock was right after all--emotions do get in the way!  No fancy bells or whistles, just a very interesting and absorbing close-up of how one act of indiscretion can turn into a nightmare for an average family.  If you are an old Star Trek fan, you'll love Shatner in this different but sometimes ""Kirkesque"" role.  Even if you aren't a Star Trek fan (heaven forbid!), you'll still love the great acting and look of this early 80s TV flick.  Get it for your collection now before it is declared a ""hard to get"" movie and the price skyrockets!",1237939200,5,1444,5.141630901287554
