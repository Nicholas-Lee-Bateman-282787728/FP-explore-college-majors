3049140,5,B0010J34ZI,"Bravissimo! For the creative work offered by Fr. Barron, who gives us not only an incomparable wealth of Church Teaching, but by engaging us in a meditative and contemplative approach to the Mystery of God; as a mystagogue therefore --- he has the gift of leading us into the Mysteries of Christianity and with the capacity of moving us to prayer!

Something of a ""Dantista"" myself, I thoroughly enjoyed his approach to ""The Seven Deadly Sins, Seven Lively Virtues"" --- it is a fine rendering of the meaning of Dante's magnificent ""Purgatorio"", and, more importantly, for both the Poet and the Priest, an inspiring expose' of the Gospel: The Sermon on the Mount! We are making all of Fr. Barron's inspiring material available to our Parishioners!",1329350400,17,746,4.920634920634921
3049141,5,B0010J34ZI,Really good DVD...had to make a trip to confession after watching it! My husband is watching now and is also getting a lot out of it!,1327622400,15,133,4.153846153846154
3049142,5,B0010J34ZI,"This video was all that I hoped for - clear, concise, and to the point. Father Barron is indeed one of the inspired speakers today.",1325808000,23,131,4.28
3049143,5,B0010J34ZI,I purchased the CD version to listen to in my car. OUTSTANDING! Fr Barron is an excellent communicator. The subject is presented very well in a clear and concise manner. Loved it!,1320364800,30,179,4.625
3049144,1,B0010J34ZI,"I need to edit my important addition to Amazon reviewing here, in light of a snippet of this show I just saw on Catholic cable while unloading the dishwasher. Padre Barron was discussing the ""sin of pride"", and it could not have been more on point for what I have been trying to get across here about this figure. In fact I thank God for giving me this humble kitchen chore to do, so I could hear it, and make the following comment. Barron started by noting that Dante evoked the punishment of the prideful famously in carrying boulders on their backs. He opined that this was to ""bring them down to reality."" Then he discoursed what true humility was, and that such was being in touch ""with reality"". He glossed as well on what you should do to have humility, and  the camera panned several times to reveal roomful of presumably married straight couples. Quite probably a lot have children. With this as his audience what did Barron offer, and what does it reveal about the man's authenticity and honesty?? Well he said that to this group of married people that to get humility they should regularly ""recommend someone else for a promotion or a position you hoped to get."" Now it would be one thing to say that one must see the happenings of the world in the light of faith, and understand that we fit into a merciful scheme in some mysterious and hopeful way in the world. That is true humility in the face of disappointment and misunderstanding at times, in everyone's lives. But this man Barron gave a different and bizarre advice. He went on to say you should actively suggest to the powers- that- be that they choose someone else for position or promotion in order  to practice humility.

One can quickly imagine the chain of unfortunate events that would follow for these married people with kids if they followed this confused, pretentious man's advice. In the real world -- in ""reality"" which Barron was ironically just extolling -- a boss would be in his rights to look askance at a person trying to push someone else. The missed opportunity would impact on the ability of this man to support his family. Money problems cause the greatest stress in the home, with anger and often even abusive behavior towards children. And psychological problems for the children who blame themselves tragically. But Barron in his priestly ivory tower is aloof from all these ""realities"".  it is possible, though one can't say for sure, that this bizarre detachment from reality is indicative of real fragmentation in this man, Not only is this bad advice, which has nothing to do with real humility that is hard-won and concrete. It is not mentally healthful advice. Religious, it is immoral advice plain and simple.

And then typical of his rather ""word-salad"" presentation style, he then non- sequitored to the idea that true wonderment and humble joy in simple things is like a child staring at a bug. Now this may be a matter of taste, but I don't think staring at a bug is the best metaphor for wonder for most people. And given the foregoing evidence of detachment from reality he evinced, I think it perhaps fair to read this as a telling indication of his own psychic fragmentation on display. His grotesque advice surely displays some sort of fragmentation. But the clincher came when he said -- perahps in a bizarre and twisted attempt to sound ""humble"" -- that apropos this deep and joyous contemplation of insects, his own ""room"" (read ""self"" by depth psychology) is by contrast ""filled with slaughtered bugs!"" That is an exact quote. And we might add slaughtered virtues as well. I believe this man, and his Catholic media prominence could not be a better example of the deep pathology at the heart of reactionary Catholicism. A great shame, for a great religious tradition.

Old Review:

A very revealing interview with a radio host is available online in which Padre Barron discusses this DVD. It is like a shovel to turn over the soil of Barron's complex and displacing rhetoric. And it shows that he has consciously developed a technique of using great works of art of the West in vast misinterpretation for utter propaganda purposes. The hatchet job he does on the nature of Dante's genius is just perverse. Here is a guy who is in every way trying to gloss over the many corruptions of his Church in his time, and what does he do to Dante, one the most brilliant interpreters of such corruptions?? He makes his famous work into a precis for his own 21st Century  rigid and reactionary approach to existence. It is disgusting and completely intellectually dishonest. Clearly this shows there is no level the guy will not stoop to mollycoddle the current regressive drift of his Church. In his violent misinterpretation Dante's Purgatorio is just about how sins are to be corrected. Huh? The entire beautiful societal sense of these vices, and the enduring aesthetic grid Dante's genius provides for all later critics of Church corruption, is stripped-mined away by Barron. This shows clearly that Barron's whole approach to using works of art, as a presage for his later ""Catholicism"" series, is just to make stuff up. It is a magic trick, and great art is reduced by being chopped in half, like a  beautiful lady in a magician's magic box. Dante  genius was the opposite of Barron's childish approach. He saw the great sins as present dangers imbued in societal evils. That's what they still are, and by what-me-worry oversimplification Mr. Barron is participating in some of the worst.",1318723200,4,5500,4.755765199161425

I recommend the Robert Barron DVD - it is broken into seven subject areas - the deadly sin, and the associated virtue to focus on to combat the various sin.

I wanted to have the new release because it has the spanish voice over and subtitle options, to share with my mom and friends. Unfortunately, this edition has low quality video, I don't know why, but the video resolution is shown in a smaller frame than the TV, horizontal and vertical, no matter the size, which is pretty annoying.

Barron uses Dante & Aquinas to demonstrate how each sin, broken into a separate lecture or track on the disc, can be assaulted by a virtue anecdote.

3049172,5,B0010J34ZI,This DVD is top of the line. Rev. Barron is informative and offers up a virtue for each deadly sin. He explains the sins and uses examples and then offers up a virtue to counterbalance the sin (your never left to figure it out on your own). This style makes it easier for you to identify your sins and how to work your way out of them.

3049175,5,B0010J34ZI,"This DVD was part of the adult education series at our church. Since I had prior commitments, I ordered the DVD instead. Truth be told, don't watch this video because of any stirring Hollywood narration. No, Father Barron cuts right to the chase and tackles each one of the seven deadly sins. (An audio version of this would have had the same effect.) His insight into human nature is very accurate. I can only guess that he may have gained this wisdom because he has been tempted himself in every category. I know I am not a perfect person, but at least there is practical self-help advice on this DVD.",1397347200,,603,4.490909090909091

Father Robert Barron is an inspired orator with a God given talent for being smarter than most of us without showing off! His wit is only surpassed by his ability to make us wonder what does GOD want us to think!

This is a must-have DVD for Catholics and non-Catholics alike. For those of us who are Catholic it is like delicious desert after a fine meal, but anyone who watches it will get something out of it, that is a promise.",1396051200,4,570,4.317757009345795
3049177,5,B0010J34ZI,"Father Barron is a gifted teacher who excells in explaining why each sin is destructive, as well as detailing the constructive qualities of its opposing virtue.

3049189,5,B0010J34ZI,Fr Barron surprises us with yet another DVD that has excellent information on the meaning of the 7 deadly sins and how to avoid them. It is a great source of spiritual and practical information and guide. Would definitely recommend it.,1369526400,,235,4.7560975609756095

3049197,5,B0010J34ZI,"This DVD on ""The Seven Deadly Sins and the Seven Lively Virtues"" is full of information, occasional humor, deep knowledge of faith and the Gospels, and also encyclopedic knowledge of Dante.  I have seen it twice and expect to review it again and again.  I've been watching it with my husband, who is not Catholic, and he is as fascinated by this DVD as I am.  He thinks, as do I, that Fr. Robert Barron is THE Catholic apologist of our age, much as C.S.Lewis was a general Christian apologist for the 20th century.  I would highly recommend this DVD, and expect to not get everything the first time around, but to go back several times to really comprehend the wonderful logic of the 7 levels of Purgatory, and what virtues act to  help us push back or turn around the various sins.  Apparently, someone in a review criticized Fr. Barron's knowledge of Dante, and while I did not see that review, it really is not accurate.",1361404800,16,923,4.497005988023952

This is the definitive guide for your life of happiness!,1357689600,6,354,4.348484848484849
3049201,5,B0010J34ZI,"Father Barron is one of the most articulate and compelling commentators on the Catholic faith in the Church today.  His status as a priest makes him even more compelling, since he has shown through his lifelong commitment that he is willing to back with his actions what he says in his video work.

The series ""Catholicism"" is probably one of the best pieces put out on video of any available in the Catholic market today, and the work for which Fr. Barron is probably most well known.  In it Barron introduces the viewer to the basics of Christianity and the Catholic Church.  The video under review, ""Seven Deadly Sins..."" is much more meat for the Christian rather than the introductory milk.  Although both are necessary, depending on one's progress in faith, this video addresses a more mature Christian audience.

In this video, which basically is a filming of a homily or speech given to a group of listeners, Fr. Barron gives us definitions of the Seven Deadly Sins taken from St. Thomas Aquinas--and throws in a little of Dante's Purgatorio to boot.  However, his addition to the topic is to name the virtue that offsets each sin, and to give real-world examples of how to live them.  For example, the deadly sin of greed is offset by the lively virtue of liberality, and Fr. Barron tells us how to be liberal (generous).  He says that next time you are buying a new car, find the one you want and can afford.  Then drop down one model below that, and give the difference in money you save to the poor.  This seems so simple, yet would be very difficult for most of us.  A direct challenge to the depth of one's faith and determination to do God's will.

In a departure for most homilies I've seen, Fr. Barron also uses humor to engage the crowd (and viewer).  This is always refreshing, never boring, and tastefully done.  It is obvious that Fr. Barron is not setting himself up as a paragon of virtue, but freely admits in a humorous and compelling way that he struggles with avoiding these sins and living these virtues in the same way we all do.  It is rare to see such self-effacement and personal revelation in a religious video or book.  Much like St. Augustine, Fr. Barron isn't afraid to admit his imperfections.  You can't help but like him.

If you're looking for an engaging and entertaining way to gain some concrete insight on how to deepen your faith and your Christian walk, you'll like this video.  I would like the chance to meet Fr. Barron some day and tell him how much his work has meant to me.  I hope it moves you to open yourself to God's will for you.",1357084800,16,2585,4.516129032258065

3283637,5,B0010J34ZI,"Bravissimo! For the creative work offered by Fr. Barron, who gives us not only an incomparable wealth of Church Teaching, but by engaging us in a meditative and contemplative approach to the Mystery of God; as a mystagogue therefore --- he has the gift of leading us into the Mysteries of Christianity and with the capacity of moving us to prayer!

Something of a ""Dantista"" myself, I thoroughly enjoyed his approach to ""The Seven Deadly Sins, Seven Lively Virtues"" --- it is a fine rendering of the meaning of Dante's magnificent ""Purgatorio"", and, more importantly, for both the Poet and the Priest, an inspiring expose' of the Gospel: The Sermon on the Mount!

3283641,1,B0010J34ZI,"I need to edit my important addition to Amazon reviewing here, in light of a snippet of this show I just saw on Catholic cable while unloading the dishwasher. Padre Barron was discussing the ""sin of pride"", and it could not have been more on point for what I have been trying to get across here about this figure. In fact I thank God for giving me this humble kitchen chore to do, so I could hear it, and make the following comment. Barron started by noting that Dante evoked the punishment of the prideful famously in carrying boulders on their backs. He opined that this was to ""bring them down to reality."" Then he discoursed what true humility was, and that such was being in touch ""with reality"". He glossed as well on what you should do to have humility, and  the camera panned several times to reveal roomful of presumably married straight couples. Quite probably a lot have children. With this as his audience what did Barron offer, and what does it reveal about the man's authenticity and honesty?? Well he said that to this group of married people that to get humility they should regularly ""recommend someone else for a promotion or a position you hoped to get."" Now it would be one thing to say that one must see the happenings of the world in the light of faith, and understand that we fit into a merciful scheme in some mysterious and hopeful way in the world. That is true humility in the face of disappointment and misunderstanding at times, in everyone's lives. But this man Barron gave a different and bizarre advice. He went on to say you should actively suggest to the powers- that- be that they choose someone else for position or promotion in order  to practice humility.

One can quickly imagine the chain of unfortunate events that would follow for these married people with kids if they followed this confused, pretentious man's advice. In the real world -- in ""reality"" which Barron was ironically just extolling -- a boss would be in his rights to look askance at a person trying to push someone else. The missed opportunity would impact on the ability of this man to support his family. Money problems cause the greatest stress in the home, with anger and often even abusive behavior towards children. And psychological problems for the children who blame themselves tragically. But Barron in his priestly ivory tower is aloof from all these ""realities"".  it is possible, though one can't say for sure, that this bizarre detachment from reality is indicative of real fragmentation in this man, Not only is this bad advice, which has nothing to do with real humility that is hard-won and concrete. It is not mentally healthful advice. Religious, it is immoral advice plain and simple.

And then typical of his rather ""word-salad"" presentation style, he then non- sequitored to the idea that true wonderment and humble joy in simple things is like a child staring at a bug. Now this may be a matter of taste, but I don't think staring at a bug is the best metaphor for wonder for most people. And given the foregoing evidence of detachment from reality he evinced, I think it perhaps fair to read this as a telling indication of his own psychic fragmentation on display. His grotesque advice surely displays some sort of fragmentation. But the clincher came when he said -- perahps in a bizarre and twisted attempt to sound ""humble"" -- that apropos this deep and joyous contemplation of insects, his own ""room"" (read ""self"" by depth psychology) is by contrast ""filled with slaughtered bugs!"" That is an exact quote. And we might add slaughtered virtues as well. I believe this man, and his Catholic media prominence could not be a better example of the deep pathology at the heart of reactionary Catholicism. A great shame, for a great religious tradition.

Old Review:

A very revealing interview with a radio host is available online in which Padre Barron discusses this DVD. It is like a shovel to turn over the soil of Barron's complex and displacing rhetoric. And it shows that he has consciously developed a technique of using great works of art of the West in vast misinterpretation for utter propaganda purposes. The hatchet job he does on the nature of Dante's genius is just perverse. Here is a guy who is in every way trying to gloss over the many corruptions of his Church in his time, and what does he do to Dante, one the most brilliant interpreters of such corruptions?? He makes his famous work into a precis for his own 21st Century  rigid and reactionary approach to existence. It is disgusting and completely intellectually dishonest. Clearly this shows there is no level the guy will not stoop to mollycoddle the current regressive drift of his Church. In his violent misinterpretation Dante's Purgatorio is just about how sins are to be corrected. Huh? The entire beautiful societal sense of these vices, and the enduring aesthetic grid Dante's genius provides for all later critics of Church corruption, is stripped-mined away by Barron. This shows clearly that Barron's whole approach to using works of art, as a presage for his later ""Catholicism"" series, is just to make stuff up. It is a magic trick, and great art is reduced by being chopped in half, like a  beautiful lady in a magician's magic box. Dante  genius was the opposite of Barron's childish approach. He saw the great sins as present dangers imbued in societal evils. That's what they still are, and by what-me-worry oversimplification Mr. Barron is participating in some of the worst.",1318723200,4,5500,4.755765199161425

(An audio version of this would have had the same effect.) His insight into human nature is very accurate.

I have seen it twice and expect to review it again and again.  I've been watching it with my husband, who is not Catholic, and he is as fascinated by this DVD as I am.  He thinks, as do I, that Fr. Robert Barron is THE Catholic apologist of our age, much as C.S.Lewis was a general Christian apologist for the 20th century.  I would highly recommend this DVD, and expect to not get everything the first time around, but to go back several times to really comprehend the wonderful logic of the 7 levels of Purgatory, and what virtues act to  help us push back or turn around the various sins.

3283698,5,B0010J34ZI,"Father Barron is one of the most articulate and compelling commentators on the Catholic faith in the Church today.  His status as a priest makes him even more compelling, since he has shown through his lifelong commitment that he is willing to back with his actions what he says in his video work.

The series ""Catholicism"" is probably one of the best pieces put out on video of any available in the Catholic market today, and the work for which Fr. Barron is probably most well known.  In it Barron introduces the viewer to the basics of Christianity and the Catholic Church.  The video under review, ""Seven Deadly Sins..."" is much more meat for the Christian rather than the introductory milk.  Although both are necessary, depending on one's progress in faith, this video addresses a more mature Christian audience.

In this video, which basically is a filming of a homily or speech given to a group of listeners, Fr. Barron gives us definitions of the Seven Deadly Sins taken from St. Thomas Aquinas--and throws in a little of Dante's Purgatorio to boot.  However, his addition to the topic is to name the virtue that offsets each sin, and to give real-world examples of how to live them.  For example, the deadly sin of greed is offset by the lively virtue of liberality, and Fr. Barron tells us how to be liberal (generous).  He says that next time you are buying a new car, find the one you want and can afford.  Then drop down one model below that, and give the difference in money you save to the poor.  This seems so simple, yet would be very difficult for most of us.  A direct challenge to the depth of one's faith and determination to do God's will.

In a departure for most homilies I've seen, Fr. Barron also uses humor to engage the crowd (and viewer).  This is always refreshing, never boring, and tastefully done.  It is obvious that Fr. Barron is not setting himself up as a paragon of virtue, but freely admits in a humorous and compelling way that he struggles with avoiding these sins and living these virtues in the same way we all do.  It is rare to see such self-effacement and personal revelation in a religious video or book.  Much like St. Augustine, Fr. Barron isn't afraid to admit his imperfections.  You can't help but like him.

If you're looking for an engaging and entertaining way to gain some concrete insight on how to deepen your faith and your Christian walk, you'll like this video.  I would like the chance to meet Fr. Barron some day and tell him how much his work has meant to me.  I hope it moves you to open yourself to God's will for you.",1357084800,16,2585,4.516129032258065
