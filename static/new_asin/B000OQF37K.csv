8186214,5,B000OQF37K,"If you love music, you may well appreciate a wide genre of tastes and styles. If so, you do want this one. Others mention some weak points, but remember, this is a nostalgic look back at the fifties, much the way we might enjoy a period piece. The opening score, titles, and scene vingettes may be a bit off-putting..seems to blare propaganda with tinny oomph-pah like sounds..but soon gets down to the business of light hearted comedy...and great singing, great little tunes, and quite memorable ones. The romantic lead has a superb voice. His buddy, so to speak, has a very high range tenor, floating around among the E.F,G, and A with ease. But the blonde, happy communist lead has by far the most melifluous tenor. Many sparkling scenes, visually and melodically. I'll be back later with a more detailed eview, but had to log in right away, and say how pleased I am that I took a chance on this. I found myself wishing there were more of this available...a tinge of sentimental sweet, slightly tacky 50's stuff, and oh so, 'aren't we all happy communists' kind of shtuck...it's really more palatable than I make it sound here. It's a delight to watch and , to my surprise to listen to. One lovely duet with the two romantic leads, starts with a distinctly Russion song..if you heard only one track, and this was it, you would recongize right away, hey that's Russions""...the tune then segues into two or three more styles of music, as in jazz,, and fifties be-bop cool dudes...all in one duet. Very clever. I'm reasonably sure you wil like this little bon bon..though we all know life was a good deal more grim than portrayed here. We can suspend disbelief easily with all the clever singing...and composing.",1357776000,,1712,4.691029900332226
8186215,2,B000OQF37K,"Since this production had received good reviews, I was extremely disappointed with it. I have a recording of the complete work and have seen it on stage, so this rushed, re-arranged, badly dubbed, and ragged ill treatment hit me with disbelief. The plot is rather slender to hang all of Shostokovich's music on, but the full musical (it's not intended to be an opera) is delightful. All I can say is that this version is better than nothing. Barely.",1350691200,,449,4.69620253164557
8186216,4,B000OQF37K,"Stalin's favourite movie, one that he apparently saw over a hundred times, was Volga-Volga (1938) a chillingly optimistic musical set around a song writing competition held in Moscow. According to Danga Ranga's entertaining documentary East Side Story (1997), only 20 similar examples appeared from the eastern bloc over 40 years - a genre doomed through official indifference, hesitation over subject matter as well as the understandable inexperience of the filmmakers involved.

In the late 1950s Shostokovich, who'd written a number of prestigious film scores since New Babylon (1929) as well as the landmark and scandalous opera Lady Macbeth Of Mtsenk, composed this musical comedy set amidst the newly arrived inhabitants of a half-built housing estate. It was a job of work to the great artist, not on the level of his more celebrated pieces, although his characteristic irony and gifts as an orchestrator makes him an ideal composer for the subject. If, in later years, he will say this operetta made him ""cringe with shame"" and term his collaborators Mass and Chervisnky as ""just a couple of Soviet humourists,"" 'Cherry Town' nevertheless proves popular and in 1963 appears as the film Cheryomushki directed by Gerbert Rappaport.

Communist musicals were rarely, if ever exported and even today I think this is the only example widely available with subtitles. It's a shame as, with all their shortcomings, from this example and snippets seen of others, they have a vaguely camp appeal. One longs to see Revue um Mitternacht (aka: Midnight Review), made the same year as the Shostokovich. Like Cherry Town, this is mildly satirical, a playful story about the problems in getting a musical project off the ground and then onto the screen in the first place. But whereas Revue wears its intentions, however lightly, on its sleeve Cherry Town, at least in its filmic incarnation, ruffles even fewer feathers. Perhaps its reticence is deliberate. Shostokovich had learnt the hard way, as had many Russians, to say one thing in his music and mean another. Having said that, revivals of Cherry Town have successful pointed up these elements more in his work set in stark housing estate where there was probably not a cherry tree in sight.

The relatively slight plot concerns the initial struggles, and settling in, of several people into their new housing estate. They are principally a newly married couple as well as a blast engineer name of Boris - played here by the vaguely Danny Kaye-ish actor Vladimir Vasilyev - who has his bachelor eye on museum guide Lida (Olga Zabotkina), and the frustrations encountered by all. Despite the frustrations of incompetent officialdom - the estate manager Batabashkin is corrupt and his superior Drebyednystev is a bureaucrat whose second wife wants a bigger flat, expanding into that previously allocated to the hero and heroine - all eventually is settled good naturedly. 'Cherry Town' is a generic title apparently given by the appreciative inhabitants on any new housing estate and this one is a place full of flirtation, sun and song, mostly bright and breezy through the running time, even if as a filmed musical piece it misses the exuberance and smoothness of well-oiled American cinema. It's more revealing to compare it to the just as romantic Russian favourite Ironiya sudby, ili S legkim parom (aka: The Irony Of Fate) made a decade later. There love is also discovered on housing estates that (its key plot point) look exactly the same, due to the central control over Soviet builds. Such conformity means that, no matter in which city you find yourself, only love brings the unexpected in a regimented environment. But with Cherry Town, love is just the icing on the cake.

Revivals of Cherry Town as a stage piece have proved how colourful and memorable a lot of Shostokovich's writing is - and in fact I found myself humming one of its tunes the day after viewing the DVD. If parts of the story were rooted in the then citizen's experience of reality (for instance the plight of the couple, re-housed at last in Cherry Town, married for some months already but previously reduced to meeting at concerts and train stations), the film also has prominent elements of fantasy. Notably a scene dreamt occupying the new flats when the main two characters dance in and out of various costumes or, most strikingly, the very end of the film as hero Boris is literally blasted into the arms of his sweetheart, watching from her newly allocated balcony above. Marching comrades or deputations do not solve problems, and counter-revolutionaries are not marched off for harsh punishment to achieve a perfect society this time; instead a large part of the wrapping up of business is played by the whimsy of a 'magic bench'. Even though most who see the film these days will never have lived in the society of the Soviets, in retrospect there's faux nostalgia to be had from the colours, d&eacute;cor and downright cheerfulness shown by all concerned.

Something of an oddity then, but never the less enjoyable. Cherry Town is shot with the garish colours familiar to those who have seen other east European or DEFA productions from the time. The print here shows some signs of use with lines and speckles, but this is not enough to impair the pleasure it gives. The UK edition also offers some unhelpful extras, notably a small extract from Lady Macbeth Of Mtsenk, as well as a brief documentary on the composer's creative tribulations of the 1930s, and a Shostokovich chronology - but the disc fails to bring the story up to date with any real context for Cherry Town, odd to say the least. Both film and music lovers deserve more.",1337731200,4,5679,4.954879328436516

Soviet Union
Musical Comedy/Operetta
1963 - Color - 87 minutes - DVD region 1-6(0)
Russian, with English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Chinese subtitles.
Based on 1958 Operetta Moscow, Cheryomushki
Studio: Lenfilm
Director: Gerbert Rappaport
Libretto and Screenplay by: Vladimr Mass and Mikhail Chervinsky
Music: Dmitri Shostakovich
Orchestra: Leningrad Philarmonic
Musical Director: Nikoli Rabinovich

One of the most popular examples of Khrushchev era Soviet Edutainment.  The movie is set in a housing project in Moscow, although most of the film was probably made at the Lenfilm Studios in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg.  Shostakovich appears to have a brief background walkthrough in one of the scenes. He reportedly met his third wife Irina, a script editor, during filming of the movie.

The plot revolves around three Moscow couples, all who appear to be in their late 20's, and their attempts to find housing in the post-war, post-Stalin housing boom.  The story centers on Boris, a demolitions expert who has traveled throughout the Soviet Union and now wants to settle down and get married.  He is smitten with Lidochka, an attractive museum guide, an expert in the 17th Century.  The clash between his brash, ""explosive"", personality, and her old-fashioned, more conservative, personality serves the main plot of the movie.  Their Apollonian Creed vs. Dionysian Challenge personality conflict appears to serve as a metaphor in an attempt to portray the Soviet Union as the new way, as the older, as the conservative, western capitalism ""smolders on the ash-pit of history"".

The other characters are Sergey, a school friend of Boris, who drives light truck for a housing administration. Sergey is in love with Lyusya, a crane operator for the same housing development, but he to shy to express his real feelings.  Masha and Sasha are friends of Lidochka, who have been married for 6 months, but have been unable to find an apartment to live with each other.  They seem to spend a lot of time dancing in circles.  Their attempts at domestic bliss are thwarted by Barashkin, the corrupt, scheming housing manager.  Drebednev is his middle-aged superior, and has much younger, blonde bombshell, ambitious 4th wife Vavachka, who is a childhood friend of Boris and Sergey.

The film contains many enjoyable songs, as well as several dance numbers.  All the cast seem to be excellent dancers, although I would describe the choreography as repetitive, which is probably due to official interference.  All the songs are overdubbed, which was common with American movie musicals of the same time period.  I enjoyed Masha and Sasha's housing lament, Sergey and Lyusya's ""What Love is"" duet, and the sentimental newlywed's ride through a Springtime Moscow.  The chase scene with Boris and a firefighter appears to be derivative of a Charlie Chaplin or Harold Lloyd silent movie.

The film cannot be considered as historically accurate.  It seems to try and convince the Soviet people, and other people of the world, of the superiority of the Soviet way of living.  The music is not as sophisticated as his symphonies, and it probably was never intended to be.  It is an interesting piece of Soviet kitsch, and an interesting glimpse at turbulent time in history.

If you are a band geek like myself, you may have played the ""Gallop from Moscow, Cheryomuski"", edited by Donald Hunsberger.  The music accompanies Boris and Lida's dance duet, where they seem to parody 19th century opera, the Red Army Chorus and Dance Ensemble, the Three-Penny Opera, and what looks like American teenagers of the late 50's or early 60's.  Unfortunately, several frames are missing, either from poor editing, or damaged frames in the original negative",1321142400,,3751,5.189368770764119
8186218,5,B000OQF37K,"""Cheryomushki"" (1963) is a wonderful film with a wonderful story. I found that I really loved the music and the songs were in my head for days. The film is basically a light musical romantic comedy, with lots of singing and dancing but it offers a glimpse into life in the USSR in the 1960's. I highly recommend it. Many people might think that a Soviet film could somehow be drab or depressing, but this film is anything but; it is extremely uplifting and even inspiring.  The film is done in Russian, but the subtitles are so well done that English speakers will hardly notice that.

Apparently Shostakovich is widely regarded as the one of the best composers of the 20th century. After viewing this film I did a bit of research on him and I stumbled on a DVD biography.  I was amazed by the man's life story. He was indeed an amazing talent, and this film proves it, even if nothing else did. ""Cheryomushki"" is a film to own. I can't recommend it highly enough.

The transfer to DVD is virtually flawless, which is unusual for a film made back in 1963 (or for any film). The soundtrack is great.  I read the small print and the DVD was made in Europe, in Western Germany, but of course the version sold here is set up to work with American DVD players (region 1-6 or basically the whole world - NTSC).",1200873600,9,1304,4.371900826446281
8186219,4,B000OQF37K,"I ordered this DVD entirely for the music of Shostakovich, my candidate for the greatest 20th C composer of all. Well, the music, although charming, is deliberately light-weight and not at all the most interesting thing about this production. It says something about the soviet ""experiment"" that a composer of Shostakovich's earnestness would have written such a gentle bit of populism. Can you imagine Milton Babbit or Thomas Ades, or any high-art western composer writing such music without being condescending?
The movie Cherry Town was filmed in 1963. The fact that it, or any other soviet popular art form, was never noticed in any way in the USA seems to me to speak volumes about the conduct of the Cold War. People in the USA were satisfied to know only one side of the story. The USSR was so demonized during the 50s, 60s, and later that this film will be hard for most Americans to watch honestly and evaluate fairly.  It's a musical comedy, closest in style and appeal to the Bing Crosby stuff of the 50s, or to ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" and ""Oklahoma"". It's wonderfully innocent and romantic, and OPTIMISTIC! IDEALISTIC! ??? In Russia? Yes, in Russia. But it's not a white-wash of soviet society. In fact, it's sharply satirical of bureaucratic corruption, of inefficiency, and of the new-man culture of newly urbanizing Russia. Watch it with an open mind. Can you remember any comparably pointed social commentary in any American musical comedy of the same era?
All in all, however, it's probably a one-time viewing production, which is why I've given it only a four-star. But I confess that I'm not a musical comedy fan; I wouldn't give five stars to any Broadway musical other than Porgy and Bess.",1192752000,4,1720,4.850340136054422
8186220,3,B000OQF37K,"""Cheryomushki"" (1963) directed by Gerbert Rappaport - is a screen adaptation of the Musical (operetta) written by one of the greatest Composers of the 20th Century, Dmitriy Shostakovich. The music, indeed is splendid, the voices are marvelous and some of the duets are simply great (Lida and Boris singing and dancing in the costumes of the different epochs). The film itself is a typical Soviet comedy of the 60th which plot revolves around four couples who all try to move into an apartment in the new neighborhood, Cherymushki. This comedy is entertaining and well acted but too sugary and lightweight to be truly memorable.",1188518400,11,627,5.038461538461538
