6782505,4,B00P1WGC6I,Inspirational  movie that shows one of the good sides of the music industry. It also gives a lot of insight into what goes into having a successful and rewarding career. I didn't know much about Clark Terry and now am glad that I know more. Would have given it 5 stars but it does drag a bit getting to the end.,1457395200,,311,4.098360655737705

6782531,5,B00P1WGC6I,"If you are a Jazz Fan, this movie is a must see.  So many Jazz fans don't know about the master Clark Terry and his incredible legacy.  This movie fills you in while you see Mr. Terry fading as his health wanes.  This documentary is done at the end of his life and recaps the incredible contributions he made to the Genre of Jazz.

My only complaint is that I did not buy it.  I rented it.  Now I have to go and buy it because I want it in my permanent collection.  Terry is an Icon in Jazz and this story needed to be told.  I'm just happy Quincy Jones facilitated this documentary before it was too late.  Job well done, Quincy.  Thank you.",1451520000,,642,4.064
6782532,5,B00P1WGC6I,"Was just checking out whether this movie is available as DVD. Shall buy it soon, with the next bundle from the US. Watched it on an intercontinental flight and was mesmerised. This is positive inspiration. This is the antithesis to Whiplash, which I find unbearable. ""Keep On Keepin' On"" is what this world needs. And I cannot imagine that any of my friends in professional music has gone through a ""Whiplash"". They feel like coming from a Clark Terry school of tradition. Correct me if I'm wrong.",1449619200,,497,4.724137931034483

6782535,5,B00P1WGC6I,"Ostensibly this is a story of Clark Terry mentoring a gifted, young pianist named Justin Kauflin. In fact, it touches upon that and does have a focus on Terry and Kauflin as the central story. But the video is much more panoramic in scope.

In between the scenes of Terry, Kauflin, Terry's wife Gwen, and Kauflin's family there are commentaries, flashbacks and facts about Terry that are revealed. This is partly biography, partly oral history, and an intimate glimpse into Terry as a husband, musician, and a mentor to many more than Kauflin.

The cast of characters, including Quincy Jones, Herbie Hancock and other jazz luminaries adds a lot to the backstory. I especially loved the connection between Terry and Jones that goes back to when Jones was twelve. Also the ironic twist of Jones being Terry's first student, but as life progressed Terry quit his dream job of working for Ellington to join Jones' band.

Another wonderful aspect is how things come full circle - Terry introduces Kauflin to Jones who hires him, assuring his recognition as a musician to whom the torch is passed. The ending scenes with Kauflin backing Dianne Reeves while Terry has another student to mentor - a young saxophonist - is a fitting ending to the movie.

I came away with a greater appreciation of Clark's many facets, as well as his very significant role in jazz and the surprising number of lives he touched. R.I.P. TC!",1444694400,,1412,4.79835390946502

I'm a jazz musician, and this movie was recommended to me as the ""anti-Whiplash"" (for those familiar with that recent release).

Without going into detail of why I am not a fan of that other movie, let me simply say if you have any interest in education (music or otherwise), you NEED to see this film.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1428969600,,406,4.45945945945946

This anthem on friendship, music, mentorship, teaching, and living on the ""plateau of positivity"" should be required watching on an annual basis for anyone in the music teaching profession.  Clark Terry was not only one of the greatest trumpet/flugelhorn players of the past few generations, he was also quite possibly the most important jazz educator ever.

A profoundly moving documentary of the relationship between Clark Terry and Justin, a tremendously gifted, courageous young pianist, the fullness of whose musical accomplishments aren't shown as completely here as I wish they had been. But that is a very small matter fine tuning: In addition to adding to jazz history, this film will make you think about how you are living your own life, about how to love and leave a vibrant legacy, no matter what your circumstances. Clark Terry's musical genius, his generous love, faith, joy, extraordinary courage, and teaching skills are world renowned. Those of us blessed to have known him take his example with us in everything we do. Gwen Terry's courage and abiding love are another example that you'll take with you from this film.

6782686,5,B00P1WGC6I,"First of all, it's about Clark Terry. So, it's a winner right from the start. Clark Terry's contribution to jazz is immeasurable. The documentary delves
into his personal life in a way that makes you feel like you know him. A large part of the film is about him mentoring a young jazz pianist, Justin
Kauflin, who happens to be blind. The relationship between the two of them is a beautiful thing. As a former trumpet player myself, I have always
liked Clark Terry. After witnessing his relationship with Justin, now I love him. As great as he was as a trumpet player, I think he is a greater human being. Anyone interested in jazz, or just wants to see a great human interest story, should get this documentary.",1423440000,6,712,4.5271317829457365

It was well worth the trip. He is a brilliant musician, both inspired and inspiring, as was his mentor, Clark Terry. Hooray to Quincy Jones for signing him.
