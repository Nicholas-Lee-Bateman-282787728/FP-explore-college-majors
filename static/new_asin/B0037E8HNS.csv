4081162,4,B0037E8HNS,"Before I begin this, I'd like to congratulate Life Blood for finally revealing what I've already known for so long. God is a woman, and a lesbian, and is kind and benevolent, but not enough so that she in any way deems it necessary to step in when horrible things are happening and save good and innocent people from dying. I did not, on the other hand, know that God is also a master vampire who sires Angels (re: more vampires that in no way resemble or hold the properties of actual Angels of biblical lore) and that she doesn't really understand how clothing works. See, God, clothing is supposed to keep your lady parts concealed. Not just kind of drape over you. In any case, it's worthwhile information.

The film opens with a not entirely comprehensible speech in a diner that apparently only serves people who's dog has just died, and is told in flashback from that point on. The story within the flashback, I promise you, is thoroughly entertaining B-grade schlockiness. It's all in the details and I give Life Blood many points for its fine casting (not one but two dwarves who are cast in roles that have nothing to do with the fact that they are dwarves, a fully multiracial ensemble that wonderfully create characters you care about and veteran Charles Napier as the Sheriff), cinematography (for a low budget film, Life Blood looks very good, with a steady camera and vibrant colors), humor (tongue-in-cheek, of course, but the ancillary characters are also warm and genuine with each other) and fan service (the two leads never wear pants in the film. Not once. Plus, you know, there's God's clothing issue).

The film has its flaws; Rhea is only slightly overwhelmed at the news that her girlfriend killed a guy at the party, but when Brooke hits a possum by accident Rhea loses her mind, tosses herself out of the car and to the ground and cries out to the heavens for understanding, the bulk of the film takes place in a gas station, and that's pretty blah, and the finale is more than a little frustrating. Also, several slasher clichs pop up. But look, if you know what the word Psychotronic means, if you like movies that revel in high concepts and a heap of filth, and if you understand why it's surreally awesome to watch two killer lesbian angel vampires in butt-high nighties philosophizing over dead bodies next to a pickup truck in the desert, Life Blood is worth a watch.",1272326400,10,2400,4.631455399061033
4081163,5,B0037E8HNS,"This film is fantastic. God, gore, guns and lesbians. What more could you ask for? Lovers Rhea and Brooke are attending a New Years Eve party in 1969. After a rather vicious and unpleasant incident occurs, the two girls flee. On the way however they have a run in with god. 40 years later the girls awake as Vampire avengers. And when the two girls reach the Murder World gas station all hell breaks loose. What follows is sexy, gory and funny. The death scenes while not very original have some quality special FX. Most of the film's humour is provided by the legend that is Charles Napier. He brings his brilliant dry wit to the character of Sherriff Tillman. The repartee between him and Danny Woodburn is hilarious. But I'm going to honest; this film is all about the talented and smoking hot Sophie Monk. No one can play a bad girl quite like her. She oozes sex but also manages to be very menacing at the same time. She gets to have the most fun in this film. And clearly shows what a fine actress she is. All in all I thought this was a nice twist on the standard lesbian vampire narrative. I can candidly say that the scene with Sophie Monk and Anya Lahiri walking down the highway on a moonlit night is an image I will not soon forget. This film is not perfect by any means. and even though 80% of the action takes place in the gas station. It was just so much fun that at no point was I bored. Look out for a cameo from Halloweens Scout Taylor-Compton and for the amusing fake TV programme chicks chase chickens.",1271548800,13,1522,4.306620209059234
8390473,2,B0037E8HNS,"Really?!?!? I mean WOW. I was expecting a decent plot to a vampire film, but this was beyond WTF?????

The only redeeming feature to the film is that the lead girls are very attractive, and acted decently. But the supporting cast was absolutely terrible.  The idea could have been done so much better if they had left the creator diety out of the whole mess and focused on the relationship between the lead women, and how it spirals out of control. As it was implemented very poorly, we get very shallow characters with a bizarre Deus Ex Machina with action taking place in a deserted Gas Station named ""Murderworld.""

I normally wouldn't put spoilers into a review like this, but this film was SO bad that I feel I have warn people away. Don't waste your money, unless you just like the eye candy of the women in a couple of scenes. (You could outtake 90% of the film and actually improve it)",1378512000,,893,4.466257668711656
8390474,3,B0037E8HNS,"This movie is a different spin on the traditional vampire story and actually turned out to a pretty good movie much to my surprise. Of course the eye candy didn't hurt either but all in all except for the main characters the cast seems to mostly be unkown or little known actors for the most part. The story is good, like I said a little different but good. The movie moves along pretty fast and because of the dynamics between the two female leads it easy to figure out what is going to happen at the end but that's all I'll say about that. Not a bad movie and if you're a horror fan then it's worth a look so check it out.",1372982400,,624,4.08130081300813
8390475,5,B0037E8HNS,the price is right.  Sophia Monk has a big front and shows it topless a lot along with another actress.  Lesbian activity and a lot of blood ---,1341964800,,144,4.107142857142857
8390476,3,B0037E8HNS,"Brooke (Sophie Monk) and Rhea ( Anya Lahiri) are models at a New Year's party in 1969. Brooke kills a guy by stabbing him a mere 87 times with a knitting needle (?). They take off and while in the desert, the goddess transforms them (after 40 years in the ground) into vampires who are supposed to rid the world of evil people. Brooke has other ideas.

The idea is interesting, but the execution is low budget as too much of the action takes place in a desert convenience store. Sophie Monk is always good eye candy.

F-bomb, girls making out, nudity (background party girls, not Sophie)",1331596800,2,587,4.4766355140186915

8390478,1,B0037E8HNS,"There are people who gave this horrible movie 5 stars? Seriously? If you think this movie is worth 5 stars, I'd recommend you go see ""Idiocracy"", because you'll think it's a documentary about the intellectual rise of 21st century Earth.

The main characters are drop-dead gorgeous, but couldn't act their way out of a speeding ticket. I saw this movie for free, thank god.",1285459200,,372,4.8125
8390479,5,B0037E8HNS,"This movie was really good. I know it was a corny horror movie, but I really liked it. It was funny and it had Scout Taylor-Compton in it...but she was only it for 5 minutes. On the cover it says STARRING SCOUT TAYLOR-COMPTON!
But its more like a cameo. Besides that...the movie is funny and semi-scary, check it out.",1284768000,,317,4.389830508474576
8390480,1,B0037E8HNS,"A complete waste of time. This film has the worst plot ever conceived for a vampire story. I forced myself to sit through it hoping that it would get better towards the end so that I didn't feel I wasted my money on this turd,but it was bad from start to finish.-DAVE GRANT",1274832000,,273,4.169811320754717
8390481,2,B0037E8HNS,"Also known by the title Murder World, this straight-to-video vampire flick offers a few reasons to make it fairly watchable.  Most notably the beautiful English-Australian pop singer/model/actress Sophie Monk(The Hills Run Red).  She's definitely not your average creature of the night.

Brooke and Rhea are a nice young lesbian couple that committed an inconceivable murder at a party back in the 60's.  Instead of being punished, God (a female God btw) decides to recruit them as her tool for destroying evil.  So 40 years later (I guess God is a great procrastinator) these ladies are sent back to Earth as blood-sucking vampire zombie angel lesbians.  Yee-haw.

This twist to the genre doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but at least it's something different.  The two fangless femme fatales wander around the desert in their underwear and start a vicious killing spree.  There is a touch of humor and some decent gore effects, but nothing special.  Plus some people might enjoy the moments of gratuitous nudity from the backup actresses.

I do feel like the concept of punishing evildoers wasn't developed near enough.  The story essentially consists of one lady vampire killing random people while her partner is conflicted with the senseless violence, despite God's orders.  Anyway, this mission did seem to lack any real purpose.  Why couldn't these sexy bloodsuckers go after terrorists, pedophiles, drug dealers and other scumbags?  There is absolutely no justice in this world.

I was surprised by the abrupt ending, which seemed way too rushed.  Anyway, this isn't a complete waste.  Vampire lovers might wanna take a look.",1274400000,6,1635,5.152091254752852
8390482,2,B0037E8HNS,"Released in some places as Murder World, Life Blood is a strange story of two lesbian vampires, made vampires by God - who in this film is a woman.

God (Angela Lindvall) decides back in the late 60s to make one lesbian - Rhea (Anya Lahiri) a vampire to act as God's tool in taking out bad people. Anya pleads that her gal-pal Brooke (Sophie Monk) also be made a vampire too.

God says that Brooke doesn't have a good heart like Rhea, but decides to make her one, anyway.

For some reason the two vampires come out of some kind of cocoon in the present (so God didn't need them right-away??).

Both stride around the desert in the underwear (see front cover), apparently their dresses didn't make the transition of 40 years!

Brooke, the evil vampire starts a small killing spree, and they end up at the strangely named desert gas station - Murder World.

Brooke kills a few more people and is finally stopped by Anya.

The vampirism is fangless - Brooke simply rips at people's throats. Anya doesn't play vampire on anyone at all. Brooke rescues one young woman from all this, and decides to have her as her companion on her original mission of killing bad guys. BUT we don't see her make her companion into a vampire.

As for the 'lesbianism', its simply the two leads kissing on the lips. Even 'God' kisses Anya on the lips. No one gets their clothes off. This is titilation for young teens, no more. Sophie Monk as Brooke is certainly sultry, but given that she doesn't actually have sex with anyone she's used as nothing more than a tease.

Over-all then this film never delivers anything like it should have.",1273622400,18,1614,4.5
