2016105,5,B0001MIQMG,"If you have never seen this movie, you may just be missing out! I would say that it might be more appealing to those who have a sensitive side, who love watching movies of women empowered. It is sad in it's own way - there are tear jerking moments - but also it shows strength (and survival); plus, it tugs at a little history and culture. This is by far one of my favorite movies!",1522627200,,381,4.093333333333334

2016140,1,B0001MIQMG,"When I saw this movie about 1993, I would have given it 5 stars, but on second viewing I can't imagine how I ever held this movie in high esteem.  It is a confusing jumble with a profusion of characters and stories with far too many flashbacks.  There are several cases of gratuitous profanity of the worst sort.  Worst of all, this move is an almost unrelenting barrage of conflicts, cruelties, suffering, sadness, and despair.  If I can dissuade even one person from wasting 2 hours and 19 minutes of his/her life on this trash, I shall feel I have done my good deed for the day.  Never has a movie been less aptly titled.",1502409600,,624,4.391304347826087

2016194,5,B0001MIQMG,"I agree with the reviewer who noted that the portrayal of Asian men should have been broader and more nuanced. That said, this film's other qualities are so stunning that it still merits 5 stars IMO. The script is a tour de force. Multiple fascinating characters with non formulaic plots. Stone's directing blends the storylines beautifully and allows you to follow without effort. The cast is very good, with Rosalind Chao and Vivian Wu as stand outs. The Flashbacks to China are a visual feast. The modern day American scenes are deliberately different, but  just as gorgeous. Look for the  unspoken visual theme of Jade in most scenes. Most impressive of all: the ability to connect instantly to Chinese culture of many generations past. The message of fierce maternal love and sacrifice transcends culture, era and gender.  Despite being a cynic, I have seen the film at least 5 times, and have yet to make it to the final scene without sobbing.",1483056000,,949,4.845679012345679

2016234,5,B0001MIQMG,"This was an extremely well-written, well-acted film.  The way the mothers' stories tie into their children's stories is intriguing.  My only critique is that Asian men in this movie are almost exclusively cast as villains.  Not very balanced portrayals of men.  It would have been nice to see some positive Asian male models in the film.  Otherwise I loved it.",1473033600,,360,4.933333333333334

2016251,5,B0001MIQMG,I wondered if the film would hold up since so much technology has become a part of our lives since it was released.  I think it does.

I watched it again because it is one of my favorites and I am so happy I did.  I think that parents and children go through periods of ""not getting"" each other until they each come to understand or be reminded of how the choices they made influenced their lives in both positive and negative ways.  The acceptance of ourselves and others for their whole person is the greatest love of all and that was the message of this movie for me.",1439337600,,539,4.163461538461538

You simply won't believe your eyes and ears. This is a five-hankies film, one for each of four ""I-Thou"" conversations between the mother-daughter pairs and one for the extraordinary ending when June, one of the daughters, returns to Shanghai to meet her two half-sisters.

I watched this film many years ago, but just sat down to watch it again with my daughters who have many Asian American friends.

2016402,5,B0001MIQMG,"One of the best films.  It is based on the book by Amy Tan, and it tells the story of four Chinese born mothers and their American born daughters and their relationships with the people around them in the present day San Francisco Bay Area and in the mothers' pasts in China.  Each character is richly developed, key to the story, and superbly acted by an amazing cast.  It is a powerfully moving story about how people overcome weakness with internal fortitude and love amid different moments of adversity.  It is one of the most moving and inspiring films I have ever seen filled with characters you will never forget (both among the central characters and the supporting characters).

2016407,4,B0001MIQMG,"These immigrant women have set the highest of standards for their overachieving daughters in hopes of a better life for them. The contrast in the physical appearance of the two generations is substantial. These mothers of Chinese and Vietnamese descent look weathered and lassitude from a life of hard labor in peasantry. The daughters, on the other hand, are fresh and respited, refined and polished from a more sinecure, salubrious lifestyle. Amy Tan's novel begins in 1949, in San Francisco, to which this 1993 film is based on. The impetus of immigrating to the U.S. to acquire the ""American dream"" is no longer true today. China's standard-of-living has vastly improved over the intervening decades as evident by their ever burgeoning middle class. Those dreams can now be realized in their homeland. Several specific examples will give a sense of what this movie is about. In one instance, the absurdity, farcicality of equality issues that are pushed to the extreme in a marriage are examined with much hilarity (the contentedness of that purring, furry pet cat being canoodled in a scene was more than a little ironic). In another instance, the excruciating pain of rejection a mother feels from her husband is quite intensely portrayed. And, in a third instance, when one of the mothers becomes aware of her adult daughter's saturnine and morose ambience or weltschmerz for not meeting perceived expectations, the mother, with much concern and compassion, reassured her daughter that she loved her for who she was, not for what success she may or may not have accomplished.  Generally, the movie is about the daughter's exasperations and frustrations of not being able to meet and fulfill lofty expectations. The subsequent feeling of inadequacy engenders a backlash of rebellion and recalcitrance depicted in comical, facetious ways. The author, Amy Tan, writes in a format that Strunk and White (The Elements of Style) would suggest and with great felicity. Her writing is terse and succinct, no unnecessary wordiness, no grandiloquence and, in my opinion, effective and interesting. (Could she be considered the Jane Austen of our time)? This movie is very urbane, cosmopolitan, and such a powerhouse of substantive, emotional depth and that is why I like it so much.",1426464000,,2279,5.15945945945946

2016657,4,B0001MIQMG,"This retelling of Amy Tan's book was heartwarming, endearing and humorous.  It wasn't *funny*, like the narrator (and main character) so clearly was in the book  just humorous.  The main character, a second-generation Chinese American, feels compelled to renounce so many traditional values from her family's heritage in light of her upbringing in the US, where the older customs simply seem outmoded, awkward and/or sexist.  I would have hoped for a more mirthful (or at least mischievous) portrayal of the main character, who bucks thousands of years of tradition with both determination and ambivalence.  Still, Lisa Lu's performance is good, and the movie works on its own merits.",1381968000,,684,5.296296296296297

2016661,4,B0001MIQMG,"Not exactly a chick flick but poignant portrayal of generation gap and universal misunderstandings between mothers and daughters.  I imagine it would ring even more true if you were a second generation immigrant.  But although that does not apply Ito me, I wept intermittently throughout the movie.

The movie is from a woman's perspective. The acting is great and the story is too. The characters although played mainly by Asian actors, have no ethnicity. You will find yourself relating to at least one if not a combination of the characters. It is not a man-bashing movie by any means. It is more about the human heart, relationships and knowing yourself. By the end of the movie you will find yourself examining where you are and where you want to be.

2016702,5,B0001MIQMG,"Co-written by Amy Tan, The Joy Luck Club brings what constitutes one of the finest Chinese novels to the big screen, delivering to audiences a finely crafted drama full of poignant and memorable moments in the vein of modern classics.

The story comprises of a vignette of four Chinese women whose parents derive from their motherland, People's Republic of China, and is primarily told from the standpoint of the heroine, whose mother made the tireless journey from China to the United States because she wanted the feathers of the ugly duckling to transform into that of a swan before the eyes of appreciating people who will accept women from their true worth unlike the sexist men they faced in the People's Republic.

Basically, for two of the vignettes, the story comprises of a competition beginning from childhood of two women, whose parents encouraged them - one into the pursuit of becoming the chess champion of the world, and the other into becoming the greatest piano player known to man despite the fact that she had no musical talent. One of them, remains single, while the other is married to a Caucasian who finds it difficult to find acceptance in her family, making a fool of himself through his ignorance of Chinese attitudes and practices, bumbling along in his first dinner with her family prior to their marriage. (The supporting actress who plays this character is the most gorgeous Japanese woman you will ever lay eyes on and the most exquisite woman on earth)

The other two vignettes revolve around two women, one married to a Caucasian, who initially worshiped the ground upon which she tread despite the fact that she was discriminated against by his parents who considered her to be of too lowly a class to be wed to their son, and the other married to an overly materialistic Chinese man who would calculate to the last penny everything they spend together to be split equally among them as husband and wife - taking the idea of gender equality to the extreme.

All of these are interspersed with flashbacks of their parent's history in the People's Republic, as they struggled against the sexism that existed throughout the world prior to the bra-burning era that spawned the feminist movement.

This, then, constitutes the basic theme of the movie: women struggling against sexist attitudes, struggling for independence against overbearing husbands, against polygamous husbands who show preferential treatment for certain wives while treating other as sexual objects, struggling against ill treatment from their husbands and, in general, struggling to break free of their social constraints like an ugly duckling transforming into a beautiful swan the way women were meant to be.

Without a doubt an Oliver Stone classic that will go down in history as one of the finest Chinese dramas ever made.",1364688000,,2829,4.995753715498938

2016718,1,B0001MIQMG,"The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women.

These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society?

This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian-Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase?

This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to ""put up"" with their mothers, who are an ""obstacle"" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self-hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called ""Asian-American experience"" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.",1360800000,,2783,4.929637526652452

2016720,5,B0001MIQMG,"The movie gives a glimpse into the lives of three immigrant Asian women and their American born daughters.  Certain information about the lives of the mothers before they came to America is given.  The movie centers on the evolving relationships of the mothers and their American daughters and includes some glimpses into Asian, particularly mainland Chinese, culture.  This is the point where the danger begins.
Its too easy to think that the movies events only occur in Asia, or because of Asian/Chinese beliefs and practices.  (Viet Nam is mentioned once in the story)
Ive witnessed these same scenes being played in my growing-up West Virginia coal mining village inhabited by immigrants from Eastern Europe and most recently, in middle-class and inner city American communities.
 For example, Ive seen unmarried daughters being forced from family homes when they become pregnant.  Ive observed children, especially daughters, being left as prey for human predators.  I know American mothers whove sold their children to adult men knowing full well that these children would be sexually abused.  I see little difference in the first, second, third, etc wife Chinese practice and the serial monogamy sanctified by divorce that is practiced by many Americans, nor do I see a difference between this Chinese practice and the Islam/Mormon practice of having more than one wife at a time.
One of the strongest events of the movie takes place in China:  a Chinese mother of one of the women who comes to America leaves that woman when she was a young child with the mothers Chinese family.  The Chinese mother becomes Third Wife to a wealthy Chinese man, and then returns and takes her daughter from the family home to the home where she is Third Wife.  The First Wife welcomes the daughter by giving the daughter a string of pearls.  When Third Wife and daughter are alone, Third Wife takes the pearls and smashes them proving them to be fakes.  While doing this, Third Wife makes the statement that First Wife will not buy her daughter so cheaply.  I couldn't help but wonder: how many of us have sold ourselves for cheap, imitations of the prize we really seek and deserve.
The movie is about abuse, betrayal and power.  The immigrant Asian mothers give one solution to end hurt:  one must know what they are worth and demand that worth; one must know who they are and demand respect; and one must know and demand the best quality.  According to the immigrant Asian mothers, it is from this knowing that power comes and abuse ends.",1359849600,,2532,4.878504672897196

2016728,5,B0001MIQMG,"One of the most prestigious films from Disney's Touchstone Pictures division, ""The Joy Luck Club"" is a generation-spanning, no-holds-barred drama about the interlocking lives and fates of Asian women who meet each week to play Mah-Jongg.

My mom used to do the Mah-Jongg nights in my youthful days, when we lived in Miami. We are neither Asian nor Jewish, but it would appear that the archetypical mother figure is very similar among cultures, including my mom's which is Italian. The gathering scene at the beginning of ""Joy Luck Club,"" especially with its cacaphony of loud, multiple conversations, reminded me very much of when my mother's relatives used to get together.

My point is that there is much in ""The Joy Luck Club"" with which many of us can identify, regardless of gender or culture. People are people and life can be cruel as well as wonderful.

Be warned -- the goings get very tough in some of the flashback sequence. One scene in particular will never quite leave my mind, or my wife's. I won't spoil it but it involves France Nuyen's character as a young wife and mother, pushed to the edge. (Parent's note: this is a film about a family, but definitely NOT a family film and is rated ""R."") My ignorance of the other actors' work is my shortcoming, because these artists are clearly outstanding in their blend of intensity, strength and dimension.

Ms. Nuyen is among the more familiar actors in the film, at least to my little world. She's been in countless films and TV shows, but I remember her best at the side of her husband, actor Robert Culp, on numerous talk shows. Ming Na Wen, the speaking voice of Mulan, plays the central young character. Christopher Rich (""Murphy Brown,"" ""The Charmings,"" ""Reba"") appears as a well-meaning but occasionally -- and painfully -- oafish suitor.

The photography is brilliant and looks marvelous in Blu-ray. The disc could have used some bonus features, though, especially an Audio Commentary. I'm sure budgetary issues are forcing bonus features to the sidelines, but lots of us out here love them, sometimes as much -- and sometimes better than -- the movies.",1355875200,,2123,4.837465564738292

2016730,4,B0001MIQMG,This book is about the lives of Chinese women immigrants and their first-generation American daughters. We learn what it means to be Chinese through the eyes of both the mothers and the daughters. From each different perspective the reader learns how their lives have shaped how they think and view the world. When I read from the perspective of the daughters I felt like stomping my feet and screaming like a teenager over how their mothers treated them. Later when I read from the mother's perspective I was ashamed and also heart broken. I loved learning more details about the Chinese culture and experiencing the heartache that came with seeing the next generation lose some of that culture.

2016734,5,B0001MIQMG,"This is one of my all time favorite movies so I'm thrilled to have it on Blu Ray!  It has so much depth and soul to it, bringing together women in the bond of friendship and family through life's happy and tragic times.  A classic ""chick flick"" that every woman should own but with so much more profundity than that phrase portrays!

Two generations of Chinese women come together as June (Ming-Na Wen) is grieving over the death of her mother.  Her mother's three best friends, or aunties as June calls them, and their daughter's, have shared a lifetime of friendship that binds them together throughout the years and the milestones of life.  Weddings, funerals, births and tragedy shape their lives.

We flash back and forth through the different women's stories of heartache and triumph.  There are a lot of tears and tragedy but the lows of their darkest hours make the highs of their victories felt so much more strongly.  I always appreciate this level of realness in a movie.  Some people only want to see happy but the reality is that's not how life works.  I feel like you can connect so much more strongly to a film when it has this element of truth.

The struggle between mothers and daughters is a timeless one that no culture is exempt from.  These four ""Americanized"" daughters experience it even more strongly with the added complication of a Chinese culture rich in it's heritage and traditions.  The mother's hold onto the very traditions that the daughter's struggle to break free from.

Laugh and cry and walk away feeling touched and enriched which is a rarity in any film.  Pick this up for the women on your list.  Mothers and daughters will love it!",1355184000,,1672,4.6552901023890785

I do understand what one of the reviewers meant when she said that the book and the film reinforce every stereotype about China and Chinese people. The problem is that stereotypes sell. Writers and film makers find it all too easy to reinforce stereotypes because of this. That aside, there are many positive aspects to the film.

I won't tell you the plot of the movie, you can Wikipedia it if you really want to find out.  There are slight differences from the movie and the novel though, but not significant enough to affect the movie.

It is mostly in English, with the exception of the mothers' childhoods in Mandarian Chinese (but of course, the movie has subtitles for those scenes).  This is a great movie for anyone who enjoyed Amy Tan's book, or for someone looking for mother-daughter movies, or for Chinese culture (if you enjoyed other Chinese family movies like The Wedding Banquet and Eat Drink Man Woman, you will love this movie too).

Unfortunately, the film can be summed up as a 2 hour+ bash against Asian men. Here are a few examples. First, in the novel, the husband who split all expenses with his Asian wife and eventually gets divorced was Caucasian. In the film, he is Asian. Also, the Caucasian husband who cheats on his Asian wife gets divorced in the novel. In the film, they reconcile and live happily ever after. And this is after he cheated on her..wow. Also, in the novel, it makes it clear that the husband only married her in order to spite his mother. In the film, it portrays him as a savior and knight in shining armor. The director himself admitted that he was pressured by the studio to portray certain themes that he was uncomfortable with. No kidding. Pretty much all the good guys are portrayed as Caucasian men while all the bad guys are portrayed as Asian men, seriously!

Some clear examples of how this was even more racist then the book which was already pretty racist are included below.

Another thing is that the movie depicted Asian men as bad guys.  But in reality, I found that Asian men tend to be the ""nice guys"".  And in fact, too nice that it became ""nice guys finish last"".

So this movie just uglify Asian Men.  The truth is, if you want to uglify anything, you can successfully do it.  If you uglify with humor, at least people know it is just for making fun of somebody.

2016819,5,B0001MIQMG,"As much as I think it's a great movie, thanks to the sensitive directing of Wayne Wang (an Asian American male), the biase against Asian males bordering on racist stereotypes simply comes through. I can empathize the venomous comments by some Asian males here, but I think it's going a bit overboard. Even though stereotypical caricatures are often based on partial truth, I find the cheapskate jerk Asian American husband portrayal the most troubling. Oddly, most Asian guys are the opposite when it comes to money. The husband, by all accounts even though Asian, is really embodying western values of individualism and legalistic formal contracts rather than the Asian traditional emphasis on community, sharing, and personal trust. I can understand the historical premise behind the negative portrayals of wife abuse and concubines by Asian males, but there is no basis to use an Asian male as a cloak for the sins of western values.

The last part of the movie is beautifully done. Wayne Wang's directing and cinematography is superb and Rachel Portman's melancholic scoring adds so much to the emotional catharsis. When June says ""cheah cheah"" (which is so fitting as a sign of love and respect for the two ""elder sisters"") and starts breaking up .... that's where I break up too!

I must end by saying that even though my race and gender gets knocked a little bit by the negative portrayals, both justified and unjustified, this is a must see chick flick for any human who has an ounce or more of universal love within them regardless of race or gender!

Lovely, tender, funny, heartrending.

Many themes, but one most central is the immigrant experience -- the tensions between immigrants with ""old country"" values, and their US-born children with US values.

And about a favorite relationship: mother-daughter.

Amy Tan wrote a wonderful essay, ""Mother Tongue,"" perhaps still available online (search for ""amy tan mother tongue"") in which she works through her childhood embarrassment, shame, and pain over her mother's ""broken English,"" and at seeing her mother's victimization, and shame, for having ""broken English"".

2016835,4,B0001MIQMG,"I found this a wonderful visual movie and a great venue for Chinese-American actresses, all of whom I found fascinating to watch.

With  eight stories woven into this two hour, 19 minute movie. I think it would be understandable if many first-time viewers get a little confused if you don't know the stories or the actors. It also got a little soap-opera-ish, too, but then again, this film was based on a best-selling book that was read primarily by women.

On the second viewing, almost two years later, I liked it a lot more and upgraded my ""star"" rating considerably. It's still a ""chick flick"" and a feminist one. The young women are that way, the Americanized women, while their mothers, those all born in China, are quite traditional. The older ladies are a bit too strict and their daughters are a bit too liberal. That included general morals and language - a big difference between the two generations and cultures. The feminist angle I didn't like was that in almost every relationship the man is painted as the bad guy (the abuser, the non-loving type, etc.) That kind of story bias was too much.

For me, the best part of the film was the cinematography. There were some beautiful scenes and great colors: bright oranges, yellows, reds and browns. Some of the young women were beautiful, too. The lady narrating in the beginning, ""June"" (Melanie Chang as a nine-year-old and then Ming-Na as an adult) was very appealing and had a great voice. Her story is the one that begins and ends the film. That ending, by the way, is almost guaranteed to bring a few tears.",1236211200,,1575,4.654676258992806

It's about some Chinese women and, through flashbacks, how they came together, and how their Chinese American daughters relate to their traditional parents and modern situations. It is about Asian families, but I'm African American and it really moved me.

2016839,4,B0001MIQMG,"If you have read the book, you will appreciate the fact that Amy Tan helped in writing the screenplay. The film is very true to the book with a few bits left out but the heart and spirit of the story was successfully captured in the film version. It probes deeply into the heart of the mother-daughter dynamic and, no matter where your roots are, where you are from or where you grew up, there is a common theme that I believe every woman can relate to which are those hopes and expectations that a mother has for her daughter. Sometimes these hopes and expectations are outside of what the daughter wants or perceives for herself but what is needed is understanding of each other to bridge the gap. This film is a profound story about women and their daughters who have bridged that gap, cultural and experiential, and the journey they went through to do so. Heart-wrenching and heart-warming at the same time. Beautifully done!

For the cinematography and the superb acting, this film deserves five stars and more. I did not give it five stars because it is such an emotional roller coaster ride that it is hard to watch - even though I have watched it several times!

As a teenage girl I was an emotional wreck over the mother-daughter dilemmas presented by this film.  I cried the whole way through.  I was so glad my grandmother brought a box of tissues with her.

I recently saw this movie again at 32 and felt engaged by it on a different level.  Now understanding more the personal dilemmas of each of the female characters.

It's an interesting experience to witness one's own relationship to a story change with age and life.

While this story is specific to some of the extra added pressures of the Chinese and Chinese-American cultural experience, the tale itself can be understood by all who've ever dealt with parental conflict, issues of inadequacy, a need to rebel, marital strife, a desire to find oneself and so on.

Sadly, I've not read the movie's novel predecessor, though I think it would be no less satisfying an experience given Ms. Tan's talent for relaying the human experience of her characters as equally along with their Chinese experience.",1225324800,,1081,4.707446808510638

2016853,4,B0001MIQMG,"When determining whether to view or purchase a movie or novel, I make it a point to read the highest and lowest ratings of that product. This film is no exception. However, I must say, while not surprised by the volume and intensity of the one-star reviews, I'm perplexed by much of their detail.

One review sited the old adage that film should show rather than tell a story. While that may be true for some subject matter, it does not hold true for all. Additionally, narrative serves to do what action and dialogue cannot--fill the gap of the senses that sight and sound don't address. A well narrated tale is a pleasure to behold, especially when the narrator has the proper voice and emotion.

Joy Luck Club has become one of my favorite films. The only reason I can't give it a full five stars is because it is emotionally painful to watch. That is to say, the emotional toll is so great I must take breaks between repeated viewings. It is much the same with City of Angels and Shindler's List.

As to the issue of stereotyping Asians--especially Asian males--I can only say that from my perspective, ""this"" story addresses certain characters under certain circumstances. It paints some of them in an unfavorable light. However, I believe it would be unfair to believe the author was attempting to make a statement about all people of the group or even the bulk of the same people.

We have only to look at our present culture and the instances of violence against women to realize that such men are not merely characters of fiction. They still exist in today's society and in nearly every country across the globe. A news article from just two days past (30 August 2008) reported where five women in Pakistan were stoned, shot, and then buried alive because they wanted to chose they own husbands. To deny that animals who prey on women do not exist in every culture is simply to be blind to the world as it is.

That said, The Joy Luck Club was interesting, thought-provoking, well-paced, and emotionally draining. If that's the type of film you like, I would recommend it highly.",1220227200,,2088,4.617250673854447
2016854,5,B0001MIQMG,"I had pegged ""The Joy Luck Club"" as a ""woman's movie"" (whatever that may mean to anyone).  I had expected this to be more of a gender-focussed film that would make it as interesting to a male audience as a Rambo movie would be of interest to a female audience.  I watched it recently I confess that I was very very wrong.  This is a movie of so many dimensions that it defies any categorization other than ""Great Movies"".  It tells six seperate stories and uses a trio of mother/daughter experiences and relationships to tell those stories.  From the first to the last (and everything in between) these stories are woven together to give us all an insight to life and life's experiences.  The contrast between Old World and New World are as instruction as the generational differences that we all are familiar with.  Each story tells of an individual struggle against diverse challenges.  The movie amplifies it's greatness by allowing a willing audience to share in the revelations that mother and daughter, ""aunts and nieces"", as well as ""cousins"" discover about each other.  Each person grows from the discoveries in the stories that are shared and we, the audience, are all the better for the experience.

The acting is superb, the sets and costumes are outstanding, and the script and direction are first-rate.  Maybe you have heard all about this movie, seen it several times, read the book, or otherwise know that ""The Joy Luck Club"" is a modern screen classic.

It was a suggested film for a Sociology in the Media course, and I can definitely see why it was reccomended.  It's a tearjerker and was beautifully adapted for the screen.  Director Wayne Wang brings the harrowing stories of eight Chinese and Chinese-American women, spanning two generations, together as an epic tale of the turbulence and pain of immigration and assimilation.  The cast includes the wonderful Ming Na (as one of the daughters).

This story really takes an honest look at the struggle and sacrifice that immigrants must make, in the face of all odds, to survive and adapt to a new culture, language and set of social expectations.  All the while, in the case of these strong women, they hold strong to their culture through weekly games of mah jong, where they gather together to gossip, give advice and commiserate.

2016893,3,B0001MIQMG,"The author Amy Tan is an Asian female 'Uncle Tom' (look up the term) for her garbage called the 'Joy Luck Club'. It portrays all Asian men in a made-up, negative light, while causing her Asian female protagonists to marry White men, who even cheat on them in the movie, but that doesn't stop the Asian girls from staying with them.

Amy Tan is a self hating Asian female. She is like some Asian girls who grew up hating the fact that she looked so different from her classmates/peers, and fit in however way she could by acting White, and wanting only White men. Personally, she has been massively depressed most of her life (look it up), and has had a terrible marriage with a Caucasian. In her books, she tries to justify her life decisions by portraying White men as White knights, and Asian men as controlling and oppressive, when that couldn't be farther from the truth.

Amy Tan set Asian men and women back decades in this country. How come in Hollywood flicks we see mostly see Black-Black couples, or Latin-Latin couples, but the Asian women are always with a White guy? It seems like every TV show and movie in the past ten years pairs an Asian girl with a White guy romatically. Asian men are being completely suppressed in television and film. Amy tan helped glamorize the exclusive Asian female/White male pairing that is everywhere on TV, movies, and commercials these days, at the complete suppression of Asian men.

These shows affect kids. Teens, especially girls, judge themselves on others' opinions, and are easily influenced. Young, insecure Asian girls are conditioned through social norms/media to 'act White' and want only White men, and young Asian American boys growing up in the US are conditioned to think they are unattractive.

Have you ever met any Asian families!? The Asian men are predominantly kind, quiet, giving, loving husbands, and providing fathers, and their WIVES make almost all the decisions (at least in Chinese culture). I'm tired of hearing false oppression crap about Asian men from White people, and brain-washed Asian girls, just to make us unattractive in their minds. Also, here's a FACT, not a generalization - as a group, Asian men have the highest average education and income, combined with the lowest avg rates of murder, theft, infidelity, spousal abuse, rape, child molestation, divorce, and crime in this country.",1160611200,,2373,4.895522388059701

The stories of the four mothers are told from the cultural viewpoint of the past as flashbacks throughout the film. The viewer learns boys are more revered than girls, a daughter is given in an arranged marriage to a boy from a wealthy family and she is expected to be obedient to her husband and servile to her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law expects a grandchild and blames the daughter-in-law for failing to produce offspring, not recognizing or accepting her son's part in the problem. This particular story was cleverly resolved and had a happy ending due to the creative efforts of the daughter-in-law who used superstition, religion, and cultural values to get out of this unhappy marriage. In another life story, a young attractive daughter is raped by a wealthy businessman, her parents disown her not believing this story. They thought she allowed herself to be seduced due to his wealth. To sustain herself, she became his fourth wife, a concubine but also produced a son, an heir ...whom the first wife took ownership of, as if he were her son. The real mother was not allowed near her own child. Eventually, she proved herself a worthy daughter by a sacrificial ceremony done for her dying mother. Later she reunitd with her first child, a daughter, whom she raised within the businessman's household where the mother enacted an even more heartbreaking sacrifice ...

All the stories from the past are connected in some way with the problems the Chinese daughter's are experiencing in their adult lives. Through flashbacks in time, each daughter recalls her own past and how she felt pushed to do things for her mother, trying to please her, yet feeling unworthy. The film blends the stories of all the characters in a very creative and unique manner helping the viewer understand how the context of Chinese culture became the foundation of love on which all their lives are based.

June one of the American-raised Chinese daughters begins telling her story and the relationhship and conflicts with her mother who had recently passed away. The roots of the misunderstandings become more clear as the viewer learns about June's mother's life in China ... June learns the expectations her mother had for her, the hopes and dreams for her American daughter were part of an unresolved loss her mother never spoke about to June. June learns about a very painful experience in her mother's life which forced her to make decisions no mother should have to make ... However, due to a letter written by Auntie Lindo to June's relatives in China, June is reunited with her mother's secret past. This is the point where everyone who views the film will need a handkerchief or tissues... Erika Borsos [pepper flower",1156464000,,3103,5.00968992248062
2016895,5,B0001MIQMG,"""The Joy Luck Club,"" in my opinion is about as close to a perfect movie as I have ever seen. I would not hesitate to give it ten stars out of a possible ten. The mostly Chinese American cast is absolutely superb in their performances. My favorite character is June, the daughter of Suyuan. At the beginning of the movie, her friends and family have gathered together before she is about to go to China to meet two sisters she did not realize she had until after her mother died.

  The movie centers around four Chinese women and their daughters. The experiences of the women in China, apparently between the two world wars, were often filled with sorrow and suffering. Their stories are told in Chinese with English subtitles. The experiences of the women in China as young girls and young women strongly influenced how each of them raised their daughters in the United States.

  I have only a couple quibbles with this otherwise outstanding movie. One is that the women, as young females in China during the 1930's, are occasionally unusually bold in asserting themselves with men who oppress them. While, as a feminist and a very strong believer in completely equal rights based on gender, I generally applaud most of their actions, it does not seem historically realistic given the unfortunate pervasive second class citizenship of Chinese women during that time period.

  ""The Joy Luck"" is a great film in all respects, the peformances by the actresses, the general storyline, the cinematography and the music. This is a movie I can watch over and again, enjoying very much on each occasion.

  The ending to this movie when June meets her two sisters, apparently in Shanghai, is a great scene and very moving, one of the best endings to any movie I have ever seen.",1152921600,,1772,4.754901960784314
2016896,4,B0001MIQMG,"This movie is a beautiful story about four Chinese women and their four American-born daughters. The stories deal with identity, survival, sacrifice, love, respect, pride, and forgiveness. I cried at the end of this film because this movie stresses the importance of mother and daughter relationship. We carry the spirits of our fore mothers and it dictates what we do with our lives.

 I have one negative comment to make and it involves the image of Asian men. After drying my tears from watching this movie, something struck me hard because I felt this movie made Asian men look bad. Yes, there were two positive Asian male characters in this movie. There was the stereotypical Asian father who played June's father (one of the daughters). Then there was Lena's second husband, but he came across as a token. It felt like the producers threw him in to keep the Asian community from getting upset, because there was no story development about him and Lena's life and their love, but you knew EXACTLY what happened with Waverly, Rose, and their white husbands.

The one character that really bugged me was Rose. Her husband cheated on her because she was too much of an Asian wife. She put her husband's needs before hers and as a result, he wanted to leave her, which she tries to stop. It is not until she learned the story of her grandmother that she understands her ""worth"". After learning her worth, she and her husband stays together. The movie is blaming HER and her culture for why her husband cheated, but blames Asian men when they do the same thing (am I the only one that sees this?).

I am a black female (how odd for a black woman to be defending Asian men) and I have studied the Asia culture, so I know this movie is bias. What strikes me as wrong is this movie is often compared to ""The Color Purple"". At least the black men (like Mister) are allowed to change to become better men and the women did not rely on men (of any race) for their happiness as this movie does. There is nothing wrong with finding happiness with a man (I am a traditionalist in that perspective), but Rose needs to dig deeper to find out why she is so needy. If you want a more balanced portrayal of Asian women and men, check out the movies from Asia. However, this movie is still a MUST SEE!",1152748800,,2286,4.474820143884892

2016898,5,B0001MIQMG,"The Joy Luck Club had stayed with me all these years even when I examine my own personal life in the current time. I had read the book when I was in the seventh grade and had a remarkable teacher. She was Mrs. Lattimer (and yes, she was white), a Harvard graduate teaching at an impoverished neighborhood from where I used to grow up. Sometimes, I wondered why she never taught at one of the more prestige middle schools even right now. Still, it was a book that we middle school students had to read and analyze. The class was actually an advance seminar class. Even to this day, I am surprised that we middle school students got a chance to watch a rated ""R"" movie. It was a ""never"" to watch a rated ""R"" movie. The only movies that I can remember watching that were rated ""R"" were movies in my former AP english literature class-Othello (which actually contained nudity). It's funny because from what I recall, I had couple of friends from the regular classes and they have never seen a rated ""R"" movie shown in an educational setting. Perhaps being in a gifted class really did come with all the special privileges(even though I was never identified as ""gifted""; I was recommended). It just seemed that every book my classmates and I read in AP english could never resist incorporating some kind of sexual element. Indeed, the literary works were very great. And of course, sex is also shown in this movie.

Besides the entertainment value of this movie as well as the complex relationships between the mothers and the daughters, it was certainly a movie about survival. Presently, as I sit in my comfortable room, I could only relate to the need to survive and live a fulfilling life, a life that is so wonderful and full of bliss. Life is about survival. The word ""survival"" will always vibrate and echoe inside my ears and in my mind. It is a word that summarizes the very essence of life. When you're child or an adolescent, it is about surviving through school. Once you graduate from high school, a new level of survival comes into play; and that is to make a living. Let's face it. Life really does center around making a living. We all need and want to live a life free from having to live a low standard of living like poverty and shortages of healthy food and crapy material possessions. Virtually everyone desires to have a career and be financially stable. In times where the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer, insecure feelings arise and stays in tact somewhere in our minds. The desire to be married to wonderful wife or husband, the desire to feel safe living in a dream home, the desire to not feel frieghtened when you are heavily sick, the desire to give your children and your grandchildren the best possible life, and the list can go on forever...-Indeed, let's face it, MONEY MAY NOT BE EVERYTHING, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE ALL STRIVE TO OBTAIN IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS. Money does have its value contrary to the popular belief that you hear about how money isn't everything or how money can't buy love. Like the feather of the swan-This feather may look like any other feather and seem worthless, but ""it comes from a far away distance and contains all of my good intentions.""",1144627200,,3227,4.554216867469879

We made our boyfriends (who are all white) watch that scene especially so they know how to act.

The movie was just so one-sided against Asian men.

One man was an abusive gangster.

The second one was the worst. He was bald, wore glasses and was so cheap that he pays his wife 7 times less than himself, and makes her buy ice-cream that she doesn't eat.

I don't know what she has against Asian men. Maybe it's because she resents her father and brother for dying from brain cancer during her youth.

This movie is even worse to Asian men then the Color Purple was to Black American men.

By the way, Asian culture protrayed by Amy Tan is NOT typical of Chinese Americans. From what I remember from her biography, she spent most of her early life with her crazy mother in Europe, so she doesn't know anything.",1129852800,,765,4.352112676056338
2016915,5,B0001MIQMG,"Four Chinese women transplanted in the U.S.A. brag about their daughters accomplishments (real or fabricated) whenever they come together. They call these informal social gatherings the 'Joy Luck Club', a name meant to express their parental hopes and dreams for their daughter's future.

While most of their conversations through the years are based on one-upmanship, eventually their false personas fall away and the real emotional traumas and hardships of their lives float to the surface. As we learn more about the past of these four women and the lives they led in China the better we come to understand the emotional, cultural dynamics between mother and daughter and how their relationships have adversely affected the lives of their offspring.

2016917,3,B0001MIQMG,"Overall, I like this movie. I've seen it a couple of times, and it's a heart-tugger.

As a second-generation Asian American, I could definitely relate to issues of trying to reconcile having parents of a previous generation and growing up ""westernized"" in the States.  It can be difficult to strike a balance when Asian and western cultures and values appear to be so different. So I thought the movie portrayed this dynamic very well.

However, the movie's portrayal of gender relations between Asian men and women is awful. It's just way too one-sided and gives no depth to the characters of the Asian men. The movie characterizes Andrew McCarthy's character - a white guy - as the only ""good"" guy, while the only good Asian character is the father who plays the more stereotypical Asian grandfather type. If anything, this movie just reinforces stereotypes of Asian men - not only with roles they play in movies, but sadly as they relate to gender relations.",1121385600,,961,4.847560975609756

i love the white boy one daughter brings home, and how he is so inept at the traditions and says something stupid about the dinner - so close to home that it was embarrassing to watch! (that would be my sister's husband, Peter)

the pie, the peanut butter chocolate pie the girl makes for her soon to be ex - that would be my dear Norman's sister, Beth - she even makes a pie like that. and her man still left, even after she made him the pie.

2016931,5,B0001MIQMG,"(Other reviewers have well-described the plot/storyline, so I won't reiterate it here.)

This is a haunting, poignant film that tugs at the heartstrings--a touching story of sacrifice, longing, loving and caring. It's one of those rare films that is all around excellent: excellent acting, writing, cinematography and of course, story. It is a film that's destined to be a classic and can be watched by people of all ages and cultures.

Though a reviewer here complained about lifting text right out of Amy Tan's book as the film's narrative, she has forgotten that a film is a complete story unto itself and has to stand on its own whether a moviegoer has read the book or not. It's the narration, and the poetic, almost lyrical prose, that helps make this movie work and be true to its characters: simple, eloquent words couched in imagery are used throughout; This is how the Chinese language really is. (For example, what we call a turkey in English is called a ""fire chicken"" in Chinese. (The ""fire"" is the red comb on its head.))

Yes, there are men in the film who are abusive, womanizers, adulterers and...well...twits, but they're found in all races and cultures, so to say that the film insults Asian men is ludicrous.  (As for the comment of one reviewer accusing Ms. Tan of marrying a white guy because of her disdain of Asian men, I (a white guy) married a Chinese woman not because I dislike caucasians but because I love a woman who happens to be Chinese.)

But back to the film...

It's a keeper. Guys, if you want to score big points by watching a ""date film"" or ""chick flick"" with your sweetie, this one is the one to rent/own...and I wouldn't be surprised if you grow misty-eyed, too.",1116547200,,1703,4.641196013289036

It's disturbing to see how Asian men in the movie are portrayed as unredeemable jerks, rapists, and misogynists, while the cheating white husband of one of the daughters is portrayed as a temporarily wayward little boy, to be returned to the arms of the virtuous Asian wife.

It seems quite evident that Amy Tan has a strong dislike of Asian men. It's perhaps no surprise that she is married to a white man.  Unfortunately, this pattern of aiding and abetting of self stereotype seems to be a way for some Asian Americans to distance themselves from their own ethnicity, ingratiate themselves with the white majority, and gain acceptance of their works by the mainstream.

It is sad, but perhaps understandable, that while their cousins in the Far East are turning out movie classics, Asian Americans still have to find success by self-deprecation.",1114992000,,926,4.961290322580645
2016933,1,B0001MIQMG,"I truly had high hopes for this film as the book received such good reviews.  Unfortunately the film version was a sad disappointment.  As a working screenwriter I'm shocked this film ever got made -- first of all, if I wanted the book read to me I would have purchased the book on tape.  A film is expressed primarily through visual images, then dialogue, NOT through narrative extracted from a novel.  The story is hard to follow and the film ends up being a succession of vignettes which do not flow and cause a choppy, unintelligible result.  It was long, slow, draggy and I kept finding myself checking the clock to see when it would finally end.  Oh, in parts the acting is so melodramatic it's hard to stomach.

As for the content....I am a Caucasian Christian woman who was offended by the sterotypes presented of Chinese people.  Having grown up in San Francisco I am fairly well acquainted with this culture and I don't recall ever having had the impression of Chinese men as they are presented in this film.  While watching this film it came to mind that there definitely seem to be personal psychological issues which came through as a catharsis for the writers/filmmakers.  When one makes a movie about a particular culture great care needs to be taken -- there is enough racism in this society, films certainly do not need to spread more.

My heart goes out to Amy Tan, Oliver Stone, and all the wonderful and beautiful actresses in this film. The young, as well as, the elder. This is not just a ""chick-flick!"" The guys I share this film with walk away with a different perspective than they expected. It's the best movie to have on when your wife has all her friends over. Forget the movie ""Now and Then"" (with Demi Moore and Rosie McDowall?, McDonald? I dunno). Anyway, this film is truly psychologically engrossing!
I do wish this DVD had more special features added to it though. I really was looking forward to hearing and seeing the actors and actresses talking about this film they did. I usually don't like getting DVD's released with an extra DVD of specials (I mean, really, who'd watch some of those dumb extra features more than once?) But, if this movie had at least one documentary, like ""American Graffiti"" did, it would be so much better, because I've really come to feel that I'd like to know what these actresses perspectives were on this film.
I recommend, ""Raise the Red Lantern"" as your follow-up movie to watch. I understand that the DVD is available now.  Bollywood has a great eye-opening film, also.

2016938,5,B0001MIQMG,"Having spent a year in China (1948), I admit to a soft spot for the Chinese people and their stories, and especially for Amy Tan, whose books I have read and loved.  This superlative movie was based on her book of the same name.

In this story (the script was written by Tan and Ronald Bass) the tension between four Chinese women, who were born in China and later came to the United States, and their Americanized daughters, is the foundation of the story, and is the theme that epitomizes Amy Tan's stories.  She has noted in an interview that such tension existed in her own life between her and her own mother.

Much of the tension is due to the cultural clash.  Times in China were hard a few short decades ago, and life was harsh. Starvation and disease was rife even in later years, when I was there in the late 'forties.  When Americans today refer to poverty or hunger in this country, they have no conception of the real poverty and hunger that existed in China in the 'thirties and 'forties, or customs like the very painful historical binding of women's feet, which in effect crippled them for life, in the name of beauty, or the custom of wealthy Chinese men often having multiple wives and concubines, or the total degradation of women which existed and was totally accepted throughout the culture. Not to mention the impact of continuing warfare between warlords, the nationalists (Kuomintang) and communists, and the Japanese occupation all of which lasted for generations.

This is an emotion evoking story.  It is more than simply entertainment; it is a story with which you will identify, with characters with which you will empathize.

Amy Tan knows whereof she writes, and her stories are compelling and sympathy evoking.  Another Chinese woman who wrote her autobiography which touched on some of the same themes, who was in Tsingtao when I was, and whose tale enchanted me, was Dr. H. Mei Lu, who now lives in Honolulu, and whose book was titled, ""Grandfather's Microscope"" q.v.  Coming from a humble background, in China, she became an esteemed pathologist in the United States.  I heartily recommend her book as well as Amy Tan's, for any Sinophile.  These ladies both write extremely well, and have immensely interesting things to say.

2016951,5,B0001MIQMG,"This tearjerker adaptation based on the book by Amy Tan, is about four Chinese mothers and their American born daughters, and how the distinct cultural chasm in their upbringing, play into their daily lives.
The flashbacks into the young lives of each mother is masterful storytelling filled with rich imagery.
But it is the everyday struggles of modern life with their daughters and the conflicts between them that most will easily recognize.  In this way the movie does not exclude the general viewer from identifying with their own personal relationships with their mother, spouse, or friends.
This is one of the best technically engineered movies I have ever seen. The way in which the lives of the characters are weaved together is nothing short of genuis, and the movie slides flawlessly from the present to the past and back to the present again
The story of each mother's youth  is both heartbreaking and wonderful at the same time, and with their somewhat broken english offer up an amazing amount of simple yet  profound statements and insights as they tell their story and try to impart upon their daughters wisdom gained through both suffering and sacrifice.
The modern day entanglements of each daughter and their often tense relationships with their moms, show us in the end that no matter who we are, or where we come from, the bond between a mother and daughter is often a complex enigma, full of conflicting emotions.
Throughout all this, the main underlying issue is the trip to China one of the daughters is about to embark on, to meet for the first time, two sisters previously abandoned in wartime China while at the same time paying a personal tribute to her own mother.
If I had to flaw the movie it would be the constant onslaught on one?s emotions right up until the very end.

I feel that the film is very interesting, heartwarming and easy to understand.  It is about the lives of 4 pairs of Chinese mothers and daughters and also about the differences in their upbringing and expectations in China (all mothers in flim are from China) and in America (all daughters are born in America).
It should appeal to a wide audience, especially American Chinese or Chinese who live abroad.",1059264000,,531,4.638297872340425

The movie skips quickly from mother to daughter, present to past, and from one mother/daughter set to another.  For people who didn't read the book, this can become a little confusing.

2016954,4,B0001MIQMG,"A farewell party for a young Chinese-American woman who is about to leave for China to visit the sisters she has never met provides the backdrop for an anthology of intriguing stories told in flashback.  Three immigrant woman  from China (Tsai Chin, France Nuyen, Lisa Lu) recall the difficult journey from pre-Revolutionary China to their present comfortable San Francisco lifestyle, while their four daughters (Ming-Na Wen, Tamlyn Tomita, Rosalind Chao, Lauren Tom) remember how difficult it is to please their demanding mothers, who are still very much influenced by a culture that the daughters have never experienced.  It is the universal dilemma of the newly immigrated, this cultural disconnect between parents and children, but this film also touches upon family issues that anyone can recognize.  The complex story is made perfectly clear through a skilled screenplay (by Ronald Bass and Amy Tan, from her novel) and direction (by Wayne Wang).
One dark cloud: like so many stories about ethnic women, the men are portrayed almost exclusively in an unfavorable light.  Asian-American writer and scholar Frank Chin has accused Amy Tan of inventing legends and cultural practices that did not exist in China, but which reflect poorly on Chinese men and portray Chinese cultural as being more misogynistic than it really is.  Is he right?  I don't know.  If so, many of those fabrications are certainly repeated in the film, which would be unfortunate.  Nevertheless, I was moved by this story.",1052179200,,1499,5.2125
2016955,4,B0001MIQMG,"I read the story when I was a student and found it excellent and i recommended it to my friend at university (he became my husband after one year).  One of the best parts was about An Mei and her mother.  Her mother's life was so miserable and in the she committed suicide so that An Mei could have a better life in the rich man's household.  I congratulated her tactics because she got what she wanted in the end based upon the old Chinese supertition-a vengeful ghost will seek revenge until she gets what she was owed in her previous life.  One of my biggest disappointments was the film was too short although it was two hours.  Still, a tv drama series would have been better so that first-timers are able to follow the storyline.
Another part of the story should be focussed more was the girl with a child husband.  In the film, it didn't show the part where the servant girl forgets to watch the candles which I found it a must to be added into the film.
Overall, I still love the story very much and I recommend the viewers should read the novel.  Amy Tan is certainly a good Chinese novelist and I have read most of her books (The Kitchen God's wife, The Bone Collector's Daughter and The Hundred Secret Senses).  I am waiting for her new book to be published.  I hope she does not give up writing because I am just addicted to her sense of humour delivered in a Chinese way.",1046563200,,1384,4.292307692307692

2016959,1,B0001MIQMG,"Imagine how you would feel if someone released a film with some other racist caricatures - a blackface dancer, perhaps, and it so happens that the director happens to be black! Does that make the caricature more acceptable? More authentic?  I think not.
In my opinion, Tan had produced something very, very ugly.
Amy Tan had become famous for her book that this film was based on. The film popularized the story to the movie-watching community. She is now considered to be a leading figure in the Asian American literature. But my impression so far was of Tan's tortured and distorted view of her original culture - it makes me sad to think that for many people, Tan's misguided work was their first exposure to Asian culture.
It is difficult to imagine that the author could have been unaware of the Hollywood stereotypes of Asian culture. I've recently read an interview where Tan states that her fiction should not be regarded as an instrument that breaks these stereotypes.  But if that is the case, why would she, who is an Asian herself, work to perpetuate the misconception of her own culture?
So, I was particularly disturbed when I watched this film.  I was angered not because it did not promote some positive image about Asians - to be fair, I don't think this was intended to be considered a political statement.  And my basic assumption about watching a film is only to be entertained.  However, Tan's work simply insults the viewer's intelligence by capitalizing on her ethnicity to place authenticity to the stereotype that she kowtows to in the film.  And that itself makes this movie worthless to watch, in my opinion.

2016961,5,B0001MIQMG,"Summary: ""The Joy Luck Club"", based on the novel by Amy Tan, is the story of four Chinese mothers and their American daughters. In particular, it is the story of their struggles for independence and self-discovery, told in lushly filmed vignettes that bind together the transcendent theme that self-esteem doesn't come cheaply.
---
A feather. The feather of a swan. A feather that carries with it all the hopes and dreams of a Chinese woman who left everything behind as she fled to America. Her hopes and dreams of a daughter who would be born in America, speak ""perfect American English"", and implicitly, live happy and free of the horrors her mother had fled in China. So begins the ""Joy Luck Club"", a story of four such Chinese mothers, their struggles for self-discovery in China, and their daughters' equally powerful struggles in America. There are eight stories here, but one overarching theme unifies, reinforces, and amplifies the lesson of self-esteem and it's survival value.
Lindo (Tsai Chin) was sold as a young girl in China. The sale was cemented when she was four or so. She was delivered at age fifteen, to a pre-pubescent husband who likes to play with lizards and a mother-in-law who sees her as nothing more than a grandson factory. Her brilliant escape from this nightmare grips with the same force as her daughter Waverly's escape from a different sort of prison.
An Mei (Lisa Lu) was the daughter of a lowly Fourth Wife, a mere concubine in a patriarchal home. Dealing with her mother's death, and learning the importance of knowing one's worth, sets the stage for her daughter Rose's story. Played brilliantly by Rosalind Chao, Rose finds her voice, and discovers her worth, when coming to grips with a marriage gone sour.
Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) wasn't sold. She wasn't born into a hopeless situation. Hers is a story of self-betrayal, and its price. A self-betrayal so horrifying that it left her soul fractured, sometimes paralyzing her into a catatonic state, unconscious of everything in the world except for one unspeakable regret. In her daughter Lina she sees the same weakness of spirit, the same tragic humility, and, most gratifyingly, a way to recapture what she had previously surrendered. In the defining scene of their story, she tells Lina: ""Do you know what you want, I mean from him? Then tell him now. Do not come back until he gives you those things. Losing him does not matter. It is you who will be found."" In nurturing her daughter's self-affirmation, she makes huge strides in healing herself.
The feather is Suyuan's (Kieu Chinh). In her escape from China, she carries nothing but her dreams, and the memory of what she left behind in China. It is that story that closes the film, as her daughter June returns to China to discover her mother's past and to find her own fulfillment of her mother's hopes.",1026432000,,2854,4.838445807770961
2016962,5,B0001MIQMG,"The movie The Joy Luck Club based on the novel of Amy Tan was a simply beautiful and uplifting treasure! The movie follows the origonal story well and doesn't try to add anything new in. This movie shows us both China and the relations between mothers and daughters. The movie is done mostly in flash back memories of a certain part in their life when everything was down hill. In these stories adventually you see how these clever people pulled through this rough period in their lives and survived.
The Joy Luck Club also has a wonderful ending to it. I must say in the movie the ending was done much better than in the book. The movie had many parts better than the book. My reason for saying this is that the movie added more emotions, more strong feelings! It gave me a greater feeling and understanding for these charectors!
So, now you know a little about this spectacular movie. Please don't miss out on owning this remarkable little treasure! Act now and buy it. You'll love it! I guarentee it!",1025913600,,1003,4.516483516483516

The movie is, however, very much about cause and effect.  It does a fantastic job of illustrating how each of us is the sum of our experiences.  Each character is a puzzle that's gradually pieced together via flashbacks.  Each strained mother/daughter relationship is amended by the sharing of their own individual histories.  All in all, I'd venture to say the audience is given as much insight into their own personal relationships as the characters are.  For that, I think it's a wonderful movie.",1024531200,,664,4.990909090909091
2016965,5,B0001MIQMG,"""The Joy Luck Club"" is a ground-breaking film with universal themes that anyone can relate to regardless of age, gender or nationality.  Truly epic in its scope and haunting vision, the movie is also deeply heartfelt and familial, enhancing its ability to speak to the audience in myriad, boundless ways.  This is an intimate portrait of two generations of Asian women - the mothers who risked everything to create a better life for their daughters in the United States.  At this juncture in American history, the movie resonates more than ever by reminding the viewer of our fore-mother's immigrant experience.  In doing so, ""The Joy Luck Club"" serves as a vibrant contemporary document on freedom and the pursuit of happiness.
Ming-Na Wen (now known to millions as Ming-Na or Deb Chen on NBC's top rated drama ""ER"") is superb in the central role of June, greiving for her recently deceased mother with the 3 ""aunties"" who miantain her place at the mah-jon table.  Their gatherings continue, with June's presence, and in the process form the backdrop from which these women's personal stories and life-journies are shared.  Each auntie - and their now-adult Americanized daughters - explain their often-harrowing attempt to escape Communist China and their difficult transition to an American way of life in the U.S.  Tears flow in both generations, not only for what has been lost, but also for what has been found here - a society with different values that challenges these women in unexpected but nearly universal ways.  As both generations - and all eight women eventually - share their stories, the viewer literaly steps into each life, aware of where the characters end up, yet fully experiencing the challenges each of them faces.  Set against the backdrop of June's trip to China to find her long-lost sisters (whom her mother was forced to leave behind in one of the film's most powerful sub-plots) ""The JOy Luck Club"" can be ANY family's story, regardless of how long they or their ancestors have lived in this country.  In doing so, it succeeds at building bridges to the past, while staunchly looking ahead to the future.  This is the sort of film that embraces real life and human themes, but also puts a face on what it means to be a zero-generation immigrant, or an exile in a land far from one's home and culture.  Like the current spate of Latin and Soviet block immigrants and the last century's explosion of new Americans from Europe and Africa, we recognize through the characters the meaning and value of freedom, family and peace as well as the unimaginable challenges our elders faced in coming to this land of opportunity.
The cast of Asian-American actresses is uniformly superb, straddling a delicate balance for the viewer that requires they be both accessible AND remote at once.  Although long seen as a ""woman's movie"" the film deserves to be widely experienced by all people, including men, who might otherwise reject the film as nothing more than handkerchief fluff.  In fact, since few similar films exist with central male characters, ""The Joy Luck Club"" stands as a film I believe many men would embrace if they give it a chance.  The film speaks for our fathers and brothers, not just our sisters, mothers or wives.  This is grand, epic storytelling with a heart, beautifully directed by Wayne Wang and amazingly accessible in every way, due to its stellar cast.  Had there been a Best Ensemble Oscar designed to honor the contribution of a group of actors at the top of their form, ""The Joy Luck Club"" cast would have surely been honored.
A magnificent film that fully captures what it means to be an American of any descent.",1022976000,,3664,4.846153846153846
2016966,2,B0001MIQMG,"According to this film, lots of Chinese gals come to America, decorate their apartments in mod dcor, and become obsessed with ""success"". My aunt is from Hong Kong and very into modern design, but I'm assuming this film is over-generalizing. Yes, mothers and daughters tend to hold petty, emotional baggage, grudges, chips on their shoulders, etc, towards each other that can last years. It's amazing how grouchy & melodramatic some of them can be to one another. I'm not talking about male bashing, either.  There's no way I'm going to empathize with a woman who drowns her own child just because her husband cheated on her. Is this some sort of warped feminism: just because men rule the world and oppress them gives women the right to murder innocents? I'd have been more comfortable with her murdering him!  I also got the impression that Tan thinks the Chinese people (in China) are apathetic towards anyone but family and close friends, which I guess could explain why there will probably never be a mass democratic revolt there: you have a billion people there who just don't care.

2016967,5,B0001MIQMG,"Having not seen it since it was in the theater, I forgot just how good ""The Joy Luck Club"" is.  The story of each of the women is personal and engaging.  Different lives and pasts leading to the same destination, each road is harsh and lined with perils.  The film is a nice blend of period piece and modern drama.
I love the dialog (""She will know I am waiting like a tiger in the trees, now ready to leap out and cut her spirit loose."")  Visually, the film is almost too pretty.  The women are all heart-breakingly beautiful, and each setting is dream-like in it's perfection.  However, what could be a flaw is a strength, due largely to the quality of the actors.  Each of the characters is strong and individual.
It is a very touching story of mothers and daughters, of hopes and fears.  One of my favorite character actors, Victor Wong, even has a small part.  A good film all around.",1018915200,,889,4.371951219512195

His name was Harold Livotny. Seeing how the Asian American male has a bad enough image in Hollywood, would it really be smart to do this race change? It's no wonder that Oliver Stone executive produced this film [he grossly stereotyped Asian American males in Year of the Dragon (which he co-wrote with Michael Cimino). Joey Tai (played by John Lone) is reminiscent of Fu Manchu]. Wayne Wang (the director) has no excuse either. You may remember how he ruined the great classic novel, Eat a Bowl of Tea, by putting Christian influence in a film adaption of it (interestingly, he actually demonstrated against Stone's film: Year of the Dragon!).

2017004,5,B0001MIQMG,"Believe it or not, I got a copy of the Joy Luck Club for close to a year and a half, if not more, and only recent decided to unwrap it and watched it. And it is one of the most emotionally, psychologically, and also inspiring films I have seen in years.
Took place at a party on the night before the main protanganist, June, was to go over to China to meet her long lost half-sisters, reluctantly abandoned by their mother (one reviewer dare to say the movie have the mother fall asleep and woke up with the children gone, that is NOT what happened), we are introduced to four elderly chinese american women and their respective daughters (of which June is one).
As everyone celebrates June going over to China to meet her half sisters,  we also see each mother and daughter pair reckoned over the event, and told in flashback, what tragedies and trumphs they themselves have also face in the past....whether it is being promised at age 4 to be somebody's future bride, having your mother being somebody's ""fourth wife"", having your husband bringing home a prostitute right in your face, or desperately trying to save your children only to have to leave them behind and hope for the best.
This last story, about the woman who tries to bring her two daughters out of Japanese occupied territory to her husband only having to leave them behind: brace yourself. It is emotionally wrenching and actually brought tears to my eyes. What is even sadder is realization that such a scenario had probably happened in real life.
Ultimately, watching this film made me realized how lucky I am living in America (esepcially to all you anti-men feminists out there who think you are being ""oppressed"", you ain't seen NOTHING), and that nobody living here now, no matter what your nationality, should ever take this country for granted....and appreciate the sacrifices of our parents, grandparents and forebearers, who took that step and came here so we can have a better life.

2017005,1,B0001MIQMG,"I read the book and it was enjoyable. But in movie form, it was not. When I read the book, I could visualize the characters having their flashbacks to childhood. But in the movie, it was too disjointed. I did not feel a connection to the grown up and to the flashback child. It just seemed like a jumble of too many little stories.
And I have no idea why they had to weaken the two most powerful and interesting stories in the book. First, they watered down the story of the women whose husband leaves her--and gave her a child to boot. That was really the best story, of how she grows to stick up for herself, but it the movie, it was some stupid hogwash. Second, about the mother who abandons the twins in China. In the movie, they make it so that the mother just laid down and thought she was dying, and then woke up to find her twins gone. That changed the whole scenario, of why this woman was wracked with guilt for all of these years. She abandoned the babies because she couldn't carry them anymore.
I don't know why this is necessary to do this in movies. Maybe if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't care--but then, if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have had a clue what was going on. Sorry, but I felt no emotion watching this. The characters didn't last long enough on screen for you to care about them.",994636800,,1318,4.213438735177865

I have since found that this omission was deliberate. Author Amy Tan was very much in control of this film, and she made the decision to cut France Nuyen's best scene, in which she reveals the tragedy of her son's death to her daughter. Nuyen is extremely bitter about this. Apparently Tan wanted only unknowns in the film and was worried that Nuyen's presence might take away from the others. I would like to see a Director's Cut with that scene reinstated.",989366400,,711,4.5625
2017007,4,B0001MIQMG,"""The Joy Luck Club,"" directed by Wayne Wang, is an impressive multi-generational saga that spans two continents and several decades. The film looks at the lives of four Asian-American families. In particular, the film focuses on four mother-daughter pairs. This group of eight women is tied together by the friendship of the mothers, each of whom emigrated from China to the United States. The screenplay is based on the novel by Amy Tan.
The film deals with many issues: death, loss, racism, communication (or the failure thereof), male/female dynamics, and economic independence. The film also addresses such mythic concepts as the United States as a ""melting pot,"" or as a land of opportunity.
The film is not without its flaws. At times, it seems like a whittled-down miniseries; it's as if the screenwriters and director are simply trying to stuff too much material into a limited amount of film. And the endless parade of abusive, selfish male characters gets a little tiresome; I believe that some will view this as a ""male-bashing"" film. At times, the story seems a bit too soap opera-ish.
But the film's strengths, in my opinion, outweigh its weaknesses. Wang gets many good performances from the very large cast. The production values are superb; the film has the look and feel of a true epic. The complex storytelling technique (multiple flashbacks, including flashback-within-flashback) is pretty well handled by the filmmakers. And Rachel Portman's musical score effectively complements the film as a whole. Overall, I feel enriched by having experienced ""The Joy Luck Club.""",989193600,,1588,5.182879377431907

2017009,5,B0001MIQMG,"THE JOY LUCK CLUB: this is actually a wonderful movie about family relationships even though some people thought it was just an Asian flick.  It's poignant, moving and surreal in the sense that it combines the same mistakes that the mothers made (as shown through flashback sequences) comparing it to the daughers who are going through similiar trials.",985392000,,352,5.068965517241379
2017010,4,B0001MIQMG,"This is a fantastic movie and one filled with joy and heart breaking events. Do not let the slow start fool you. I am not usually into dramas and it is rare that i can sit through one that starts off slower than usual. This is not a action film or one filled with comedy, its true power lies in the carefully crafted transition from modern time to the pasts of these wonderful female asian characters. The words here are so important as well as the narrators voice and tone that you find yourself hanging on to the even the smallest details mentioned.
Even if you have studied Asian history and events in the past or now, this movie has a gripping way of holding your attention and leaving you hoping for more. Nothing can prepare you for the inner stories such as these.
Give this movie a chance even if you don't like dramas, but be warned, grab a tissue before you sit down.",973728000,,877,4.321212121212121
2017021,5,B0001MIQMG,"I knew I would love this movie because I loved the book and love all of Amy Tan's writings.  I didn't find it difficult to follow at all. I went with my mother and she really enjoyed it also...especially the tearful ending.  The movie looked good, too.  The costumes and settings were beautiful and even the actors were extraordinarily attractive...particularly Tamlyn Tomita. I remember her in The Karate Kid II.",973036800,,413,4.871428571428571

2017024,5,B0001MIQMG,"I fought hard not to be subjected to this movie... and I'm glad that my  protests went unheeded.  This is one of the most enjoyable movies that I've  ever had the pleasure to watch.
I don't know any of the performers names,  so I can't give a run-down, but the ensemble cast as a whole really  delivered in this one.
This movie managed to mix American and Japanese  traditions and lifestyles in an amazing way demonstrating the struggle in  culture and generation gaps.
This movie has a lot to give in the way of  enlightenment and entertainment and I would strongly recommend it to  anyone.",965865600,,591,4.552380952380952
2017025,4,B0001MIQMG,"This and the Ang Lee film ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" were both released at about the same time.  And I think they may have cancelled out each other.  Both are great but like any wonderful film, if another equally  great film with a similar theme is released at the same time it can cause  an overload.  People won't go see either.
So why should you see the Joy  Luck Club?  Because the acting is wonderful.  Really top notch.  If the  current affection for having asian women in films lasts then maybe we could  see more of these fine actresses.  Too bad that so many wonderful actors  can get typecast because of race but there is hope.  I'd absolutely love  some more films like this.
Wayne Wang's direction is great.  This story  goes from funny to sad to touching without being cliche.  This movie might  be marketed more toward women, and it does hit on great female  relationships, but it's not to sappy the boyfriend will cry from boredom.",964224000,,941,4.488095238095238
2017026,1,B0001MIQMG,"As a UC Berkeley Asian American Studies and political science graduate and law school student, I find that Amy Tan's writing is disturbing.  The movie did nothing less than propagate an implicit caricature of contemporary  Asian American culture.  Amy Tan capitalizes on the harsh images that  popular mainstream media conveys upon Asian American men.  Indeed, it is  disheartening that she portrays the women who did marry Asian men as  grossly insensitive and unfair at best.  On the contrary, Amy Tan's work is  OFFENSIVE to the very nature of what is held up as positive portrayals of  Asian American cultural expressions today.  White men are seen as the  choice partners who don't abuse, rape or abuse Asian women.  The message  Amy Tan (who herself is married to a white man) is conveying is that Asian  entirely lack the togetherness and societal norms of what is deemed to be  acceptable or even required to be accepted in today's society.  In fact, it  is the opposite!  I fail to see what others are stating about Amy Tan's  work.  Not only is it a harsh distortion and moreover, a sad commentary on  what the U.S. publishing world and the national audience want:  a  whitewashed and horribly tragic distortion of today's Asian America.  DON'T  GET THIS MOVIE!",963100800,,1271,4.877358490566038
2017027,5,B0001MIQMG,"As an Asian-American woman, I found many parts of this film (and the book it's based on) struck close to home (I still cry everytime I watch it.) But it's not just a chick-flick:  a colleague of mine (European, male, 40-ish)  also thought it was excellent.  The portrayal of Asian family dynamics is  realistic, except Asian men do get kind of a bad rap (as was the case in  Amy Tan's original book.)  But I keep going back to these amazing stories,  and the emotions depicted here so heartbreakingly -- if you can follow the  8 different characters and stories, it will be worth it!",956620800,,583,4.485714285714286
2017028,5,B0001MIQMG,"The Joy Luck Club can be watched and understood on many levels.  It appealed to me as a man because the themes of this movie are universal.  This movie was about ""hope"" and the wish of every normal  parent--that their children will exceed them, be happier than they are, and  have peace of mind.  This movie was also about overcoming adversity and the  ""inner demons"" of shame, regret, and the sometimes horrible  mistakes that some of us have made in our lives.  Some viewers reviewing  this movie found it to be depressing. I had the opposite reaction.  I found  The Joy Luck Club to be uplifting and soothing. It is a movie for people  who are not affaid to feel and think.  I cannot recommend this movie highly  enough!",949795200,,723,4.503875968992248

2017040,5,B0001MIQMG,"This movie is truly one of the most extraordinary movies I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  This movie deals with the love and struggle between the mothers and their daughters.  One doesn't necessarily have to be an Asian to relate to this movie, anyone can relate to this movie.  I can't  believe the Academy Awards ditched this magnificent piece of art.  This  movie should have been nominated in every single category in the Oscars and  won all of them.",948672000,,462,4.7
2017041,1,B0001MIQMG,"Obviously, Wang hasn't seen enough Chinese movies to know how poor the stereotyping is happening here. It's so sad I'd die in shame if this is how Chinese people in general are. Even my mother tell more honest story than  this. The part about life in China was SO BAD.

2017042,5,B0001MIQMG,"Following the death of her mother, a young Chinese-American woman June (Wen), takes her place in the routine game of mahjongg - a tradition maintained by her late mother and her friends, who all came to America  seeking escape from the incredibly harsh life in turbulent China. She  learns what they went through not only there, but what they had to face in  adjusting to life in the U.S. And as each mother has had daughters, so we  also learn how they grew up as first-generation Americans - caught between  two wildly-different cultures, never quite fitting into either. There are  some six stories in all, with a linking subplot. You don't have to have  lived a similar life to enjoy this film, but it's not everyone's cup of  tea, being one of those movies that pulls more than once at your  heartstrings. And at times, it does tend to give the Chinese female  stereotype that you would only get in a Hollywood production. Having said  that, I enjoyed it immensely, and the wealth of acting talent and gripping  storyline are the main reasons why.",946944000,,1052,4.657608695652174
2017043,5,B0001MIQMG,"Joy Luck Club is a really good movie to watch with your mom or daughter, as it is definately a chick-flick.
Hearing each woman tell their story can touch all of our hearts, because this movie shows that no matter where  in the world you live, no matter your skin color, no matter what  nationality you are and no matter what language you speak, we all feel the  same feelings at times and go through some of the same trials.
Be sure to  have some kleenex on hand.. because this is a real tear jerker.

2017044,5,B0001MIQMG,"Okay, I'm disgusted by the review in which this movie was only given one star.  This movie posseses a certain quality that makes you feel like you know the characters, and understand them.  I have never been so captivated  by one cast of any movie.  This movie can send you on an emotional  rollercoaster.  When the characters feel an emotion you feel it almost as  strong.  This movie could stand proud against any Academy Award winning  movie.",945993600,,445,4.675324675324675
2017045,5,B0001MIQMG,"I saw this in the seventh grade and didn't think it was so great until I got older and now that I understand it more and can relate to it more, I love it.  It crosses racial boundaries because even people that aren't  asian and went thru the ""experience"" love the movie. It explores  the deepest relationship between mothers/daughters and all the struggles we  go through together as women.  Altho this movie is great,I have to say that  in some ways this movie is biased against Chinese males, depicting them as  immoral and selfish but this isn't all true.  And in some aspect, it also  depicts asian women as ""naive and subservient"" which also is not  true.  Men are more dominant in asian cultures, but I think the movie  exaggerated a bit.  Although the movie is stereotypical in ways, I still  think it's great and will make you cry and cry a million times. If you ever  had parents that you never had an affectionate, expressive relation with,  you will love this movie because it will make you feel that no matter what  you become in life, your parents are truly proud of you and will always  love you altho this may sound corny!  It's a great movie though.. You have  to BUY it.",945561600,,1187,4.457943925233645
2017046,5,B0001MIQMG,You definately don't have to be oriental to enjoy this movie!  It is very well filmed and showcases different families and the life desicions they have all chosen.

You won't be able to get over how easily you  relate to the stories of misunderstanding, love, tragedy and hope here.  I've seen this film at least 7 times, and every time I take something new  from the film.

Last year in the tenth grade, Miss Keifer, our english  teacher read us the novel and showed us the movie.  Since then, I have read  The Kitchen God's wife, and am now reading The Hundred Secret Senses, both  of which are by Amy Tan.

8014840,5,B0001MIQMG,"I love this movie.  It's examination of mother-daughter relationships, immigrant communities, second generation identity struggles, life in China during 1920-1940.  The storytelling is lush and engaging.  It gives us enough to understand basic elements of Chinese culture for those who are unfamiliar but doesn't overburden us trying to explain it.  I agree with others that it's main drawback and issue is it's stereotypical portrayal of Asian men but I don't feel it lowers the enjoyment or quality of the movie.  The story is not about the men, they are a tool for driving forward the women's stories and relationships with each other.  In this sense the stereotypes are somewhat necessary in order to maximize the focus on the women and help them to fully experience their story.  The men are peripheral to the story and rounding out their characters and removing stereotypes would likely detract from the experience, in my opinion.",1525305600,,936,5.158940397350993
