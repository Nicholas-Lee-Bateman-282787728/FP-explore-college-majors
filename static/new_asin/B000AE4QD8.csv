Doc Martin is a skilled physician but devoid of a bedside manner or any social skills.  In this opening episode, he survives his interview with the town worthies, only to offend practically everyone in town in the course of a nightmarish (for him) first day on the job in which pretty much everything goes wrong.  Hilarious stuff,  saved by the good Doc's superb medical skills (and lack of real malice) and the need of the town for a good doctor.  Highly recommended.",1464739200,3,670,4.741379310344827

It is interesting having seen the latest series to find how well the characters have grown and evolved into the part they play.  The last seasons seems to have been shot in extremely good weather, the first season series is at times atmospheric with sea fog and clouds.  The show is very enjoyable, we watch it to relax and chill.  Now big fans",1458259200,,454,4.433734939759036

The characters and stories are very small town British. If you like human stories, you will like this. The main character is a bit hard to love. There is a child who is a lot like him. There are ditzy people and normal people- a lot like life. It may make you see a bit of yourself in it.",1443916800,,379,4.121621621621622

There is a cd of just the music. Big impact. Emotionally enveloping. Energetic. The whole cast, like the Downton Abby cast is excellent.

2386950,5,B000AE4QD8,"Dear Friends and Fans,
You haven't seen, but heard about or maybe haven't even heard about Doc Martin? Well, now that you have vacated the rock you've been living under, not that I'm judging, it is time to get caught up on the first 5 seasons of this fantastic series from the BBC. The Doc is an uber-surgeon with no bedside manor who is set down in a small Cornish village because of a medical challenge. He has a bad case of hemo-phobia. That is he gets sick at the sight of blood. He not only has to deal with this but with the large cast of quirky characters who irritate him no end, and that is when they are well. It is a wonderful series, destined to become a classic.",1419897600,2,675,4.1603053435114505

The show has a some slower spots, but overall is very entertaining; which shouldn't be a surprise since I know people just like all the characters.  It's nice to see a show just for the plot and acting, not who the actors are in real life.

It won't become a soap opera in any way.  I love the little town, the scenery is breathtaking.

Words cannot express how sad and disappointed I am that the series has gone from free with Amazon Prime to an unaffordable $1.99 an episode.",1411516800,,406,4.561643835616438

2386987,5,B000AE4QD8,"One of the best series I've ever seen, and explosively funny.  The story of a surgeon who is a genius and has a brilliant career in London, but who ends up developing a fear of blood (hemophobia).  As a result, he finds himself having to give up his successful surgical practice in fashionable London, and obtains a position as a GP in a provincial fishing town in Southern England instead.  Never mind that Doc Martin also suffers from something not unlike Aspergers' Syndrome, with plenty of OCD thrown in.  He just doesn't seem to pick up easily on social cues, and he certainly lacks patience!  How does he deal with the change and with the very different environment of these homegrown townspeople?  You'll have to watch it to find out!

You will start out disliking Doc, but by the end of the 1st episode you'll love him, and won't be able to stop until you've watched all the episodes in every series.",1409702400,,908,4.567901234567901

2386993,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin!! I LOVE him!!. This series is one of the very best  I have ever watched. The characters have moved into my heart lock, stock, and barrel. Perhaps the writers didn't want to make the Doc a hero, but he is to me because he puts the care and welfare of his patients above himself every time. He jettisons his own personal needs of the  moment to rush to another's medical aid. His social gracelessness is mostly tactless  honesty, But I find him no more self centered than any of the rest of the people; in fact, much less. He has absolutely no ax to grind and no agenda, which makes him very likeable in my book. I do grieve, however, for the state of his relationship with Louisa, who can't seem to rise above he own need to self-protect, when real love should do a little self-sacrifice now and then when she could just patiently listen, and not rush to react.",1409097600,5,872,4.337423312883436

It was filmed in Port Issac, in Cornwall and we had visited there many years ago so we recognized it right away. So now we are going back to the beginning starting with season 1 thanks to Amazon. It's a great story about this doctor who was a London Surgeon and developed an aversion to the sight and smell of blood, so he now is trying his hand at being a GP in a tiny Cornish village. The only thing I can criticize is that the townspeople are not acting like I would expect. Having lived in the UK for many years I have never seen such rude people as those. Maybe it will get better.

I always feel good after each episode, no one is mean spirited or laughing at each other, it is just people caring about people and showing all their ""quirks"" along the way. I just love to see how English TV can produce shows that do not have to have stupidity, sex, violence, cruelty, etc. in them to make them really enjoyable. I am not against some of these elements in some shows, but sometimes it is really nice to get an escape from all of that and really relax to a show as pleasant and intelligent as Doc Martin.",1407110400,,552,4.266666666666667

2387055,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin may very well be my favorite series of all time. Martin Clunes is wonderful as the curt, emotionally damaged, Doc Martin. Having been a renowned neurosurgeon in London, Dr. Martin Ellingham develops a phobia of the sight and smell of blood, He leaves London to become a GP in a small village on the coast of Cornwall. Every character introduced in this series is endearing. Watching Doc Martin slowly begin to form friendships in this delightful village is satisfying. I love the way these quirky characters just accept Martin exactly as he is from the beginning. I recently watched Martin Clunes in the series ""William and Mary"", and learned what a marvelously diverse actor he is. Seeing him play a warm, funny, compassionate man in this other series has made me love Doc Martin even more. I have watched all 6 seasons...over and over, I'm not ashamed to say, and I can't wait to see season 7!",1406764800,,906,4.70440251572327

2387096,5,B000AE4QD8,"Certainly not the run of the mill American serial TV.  Interesting characters that project realistic emotional reactions to situations endemic to a small village in England.  The landscape and the village buildings become a part of the cast in the way they participate in the story.  The lead character, a doctor wanting out of a high pressure medical position in London(?) comes to a small village in Cornwall and takes over a small village medical practice.  He is in frequent conflict with the villagers in trying to impose his no-nonsense approach to medicine on the villagers idiosyncratic, sometimes myth driven, approach.  The pleasure of the stories comes from how they both adjust to each other, the adjustments based on a desire to help and generate good outcomes.  The pleasure is accented by a good dose of humor.",1406246400,,825,4.985401459854015

I liked it well enough to seek out shows from the beginning and Amazon delivered!  The show is a gently paced blend of gentle relationships, stumble bums, the not-so-nice and wisdom.  No violence.

2387132,4,B000AE4QD8,"I started watching the Doc Martin series starting with season 5 and I really, really enjoy it.  So I went back to season one just to understand how he got to practicing medicine in Port Wenn. As with any series it takes time to ""gel"".  But overall it's gets better with each episode in season 1.  The doctor and many of the main characters are perfectly cast!  Main actor M. Clune often makes me totally forget I'm watching someone act because he's so dang good at constantly maintaining the Doc Martin idiosynchrasies and personality.  And don't be fooled.  Although most of the story lines try to be light-hearted, the writers also throw in some really poignant storylines once in a while.  For those in the know...I love Auntie Joan and hope to be like her when I'm 80 something!  So I will continue to progress through each season since it gets better and more interesting.  Definitely my new tv ""fix"".",1405641600,,906,4.6125

Was looking for a new series to get wrapped up in; one with interesting characters, one with a bit of comedy and drama, and I've found it in Doc Martin.  Doc Martin himself is a bit like House, but not quite as intentionally insulting/abrasive. Am already connecting with the other characters who live in Port Wein and looking forward to meeting more of them - looks like there may be a bit of romance for the Doc-awkward tho it must be!?

2387142,4,B000AE4QD8,"The first season doesn't have a lot of the predictable drama pitfalls that so many shows have.  It will have all of the typical set ups and you start thinking ""ah man now we're going to have this big awkward moment were he spends the next 20 minutes apologizing"" and at that pinnacle instant, he just walks away because he doesn't care and you get on with the story.

Later seasons begin to add in the typical drama that plagues most British and American series.  The plot is set up in the first 5 minutes and you might as well fast forward to the end because you already know how the episode is going to go, but this first season is unpredictable and refreshing.",1405382400,,663,4.330645161290323

2387158,4,B000AE4QD8,If you like very quirky British humor this may be your cup of tea. I had tried to watch later episodes but had trouble getting into the story. I decided to give it another chance and started with episode 1 of the first season. It grows on you. By the end of the first season I was hooked.,1404950400,,288,3.9827586206896552

It stops and dtutters and I have to keep hitting the fast forward button for a long time to tty to get past the tough spots.

2387185,4,B000AE4QD8,"It grew on us. At first, the stiffness and discomfort of the main character made for uncomfortable watching, but by the end of the first episode, we got the humor and the basic outline of the show. We really do enjoy it now. Lots of wry humor, often tender moments as we get to understand more about why Doc Martin is the way he is.",1404172800,,332,4.123076923076923

2387190,4,B000AE4QD8,The Doc Martin series is one that I had never watched previously.  Having it available on Amazon prime free makes for good entertainment when summer months are void of good TV.,1404086400,,176,4.67741935483871

2387193,5,B000AE4QD8,"This is a great series if you love seeing gorgeous scenery where you will probably never get to travel!  The Doc's antics with the locals are hilarious, as he is such a snob, with childhood issues and bad parents.  The locals never give up trying to make him one of their own, however, and Doc gets punished by falling in love with a local beauty!",1404000000,,347,4.323076923076923
2387194,5,B000AE4QD8,Doc Martin is a great source of entertainment for the whole family and it provides a sort of moral at the end.,1404000000,,110,4.045454545454546

2387196,5,B000AE4QD8,"Like most British comedy I've seen Doc Martin has a subdued humor. But it also has a theme and interesting characters.  British shows aren't for everyone.  But if you like them, Doc Martin worth a look.",1403913600,,202,4.583333333333333
2387197,4,B000AE4QD8,Doc Martin always knows how to make a situation awkward! I mean come on a doctor with a blood phobia lol. Although I must say I rarely felt sorry for him. Social issues or not he doesn't try much to improve upon his bad manner which is what makes the show so funny.,1403827200,,265,4.018867924528302
2387198,5,B000AE4QD8,Seriously enjoy Doc Martin. Saw a couple of them on Directv and then found out amazon had them all so I got the fire tv to watch them. Only then found out I had a 5GB download limit on my broadband satellite from Dishnetwork and can only watch 1 or 2 a month.,1403740800,,259,3.9056603773584904

2387200,4,B000AE4QD8,A bit of a slow start but becomes quite a charming and entertaining story line. By the end of the season you'll have a sense of familiarity in the town and an understanding of how the eccentricities of people becomes the glue that holds the community together. Beautiful setting of Cornwall.,1403740800,,291,4.7254901960784315
2387201,4,B000AE4QD8,"We are now into season 3, and find the writing very inconsistent and downright stupid at times (do I sound like the Doc?) but season one seems to be the best so far",1403740800,,164,4.0
2387202,5,B000AE4QD8,"It's a great show! And I like the way Amazon named it Episode 1, 2, 3 and so on. That makes viewing in sequence of episode so much more logical and easy to go to the next episode.",1403654400,,179,3.736842105263158

2387204,5,B000AE4QD8,We just discovered Season 6 on PBS this past year and were pleased to see Amazon Prime had free access to previous seasons.  Definitely recommend the show!  It is hilarious.,1403568000,,173,4.733333333333333
2387205,5,B000AE4QD8,This show is full of humor from a doctor with no bedside manner. The small village atmosphere give him plenty of fuel for his sarcastic personality to thrive!!!,1403568000,,160,4.75
2387206,5,B000AE4QD8,I have watched it before on television but it is so great to see the whole series on Amazon.  I highly recommend watching it.  I know you will enjoy it.,1403568000,,152,4.033333333333333

2387208,4,B000AE4QD8,"Having begun watching Doc Martin at the tail end of season 3 and every episode thereafter through season 6, it was nice to view the very 1st season.  Not sure if I would have stuck with the series after the initial episode of season 1, but things pick up with the quirky storyline with each of the 6 episodes.  I didn't care for the original surgery receptionist's character and found myself longing for either Pauline or Morwenna.",1403481600,,431,4.584415584415584
2387209,5,B000AE4QD8,"I am watching at least three episodes a day love it! It is improving as it goes along all the actors are terrific and I love Martin. How lovely to have an actor who is not the usual pretty boy and an old curmudgeon to boot, but  we root for him. Just wish he'd adopt the poor old dog I'd take him in myself!!",1403481600,,308,3.8125
2387210,4,B000AE4QD8,Typically British humor with a look at real life. and Doc gives you a real look at people in the isles. Kinda makes ye want to visit. It is warm to see a straight laced non loving person get a taste of real love with the woman he falls in love with and the love he feels when he sees his son for the first time. It is well acted with a good dosage of humor. My kind of show.,1403395200,,374,3.6875
2387211,5,B000AE4QD8,A relative told me about this series so I gave it a try.  There are also two pre-quels introducing the main character - although there were some changes for the actual series.  I am now into season 2.  I wish all television could be of such high quality.,1403395200,,254,4.25
2387212,5,B000AE4QD8,This interesting and funny show is set in a small town on the scenic Cornish coastline.  The characters are flawed but completely lovable.,1403395200,,138,5.0
2387213,5,B000AE4QD8,"If you enjoy quirky characters, a beautiful setting and interesting plots, then Doc Martin is the show for you.  It is wonderfully written, with the main character being so sarcastic and socially inept that you will love him from the first.  He is actually not a bad person, he just says exactly what he is thinking without regard for others feelings, but not in a nasty way.  The love story between Martin and Luisa is wonderful and just gets better each season, which is a testament not only to the writing, but to the fine performances of both actors involved.  The supporting cast of townsfolk, as well as any guest stars, are perfectly cast and really make the show shine.  If you enjoy British humor along with good storytelling you will love this series.",1403308800,,761,4.649253731343284
2387214,5,B000AE4QD8,Like the entire show. Like the peek into another part of British culture that I really didn't know much about. Plus the show has some well-written and very funny scenarios. The acting is well done too.,1403308800,,201,4.611111111111111
2387215,5,B000AE4QD8,We found this very enjoyable.  We have see all 6 seasons now and wish that they would have continued the series.,1403308800,,112,4.333333333333333
2387216,5,B000AE4QD8,I love this series and can't wait for the new shows. I'd live to go and visit this area someday.,1403308800,,96,3.85
2387217,5,B000AE4QD8,Loved it!  Couldn't stop till we had seen all seasons on Netflix.  Charming!  Loved the characters and setting.  Beautiful landscape!,1403222400,,133,5.5

2387219,4,B000AE4QD8,"I started watching Doc Martin based on a recommendation from my cousin. So far I have watched only a few episodes of series one. I enjoy it mainly because of the very beautiful outdoor scenes of Port Isaac, Cornwall. The title character is a new general practice doctor in a small fishing village called Portwenn. He is a capable physician trying to appear all-knowing but it comes off as more awkward than arrogant. He bumbles along, learning the ways of the small village making many errors along the way that help him to learn about the people of the town, and their wonderful attributes. I catch an episode or two when I can, and I am eager to see more of the show now that I've become familiar with the characters.",1403222400,,719,4.4961832061068705
2387220,4,B000AE4QD8,I like the show very uch interesting characters and life situations the main character had just enough warmth to make to him interesting,1403136000,,136,4.956521739130435
2387221,5,B000AE4QD8,"A very unlikable guy, who becomes likeable as it goes on. Each episode is a story in its selfe. A bull in a China Shop if you will. It grows on you. If you like a story that continues on this is it.",1403136000,,198,3.627906976744186
2387222,5,B000AE4QD8,"I started watching Doc Martin about a week ago and now can't get enough of it. The characters are all insane but a funny, lovable kind of crazy. Great show!!!",1403049600,,158,4.3
2387223,5,B000AE4QD8,"I'll give this series a full five stars. My favorite discovery this year, I can't stop watching it. All the characters are warm and funny and don't try to outdo one another. It is superbly written, directed and filmed, a good choice for family viewing. I would recommend this series to my friends and family. I watch it nightly on my tablet and have watched 3years of episodes since ""my discovery""! Oh and the scenery is beautiful too.",1403049600,,435,4.589743589743589
2387224,5,B000AE4QD8,Doc Martin is so serious and yet so funny. I personally could not get enough of Doc Martin. I watched all 6 seasons within a week. It is an addicting show. This is the best show that I have seen in a while. I hope there is more to come.,1403049600,,236,3.74
2387225,5,B000AE4QD8,Great family series without violence and vulgarity. A very refreshing show that I thoroughly enjoyed. I've actually visited England where the series takes place so it has even more appeal to me for this reason as well.,1403049600,,218,4.918918918918919
2387226,5,B000AE4QD8,"I so enjoy Doc Martin.  The writers of this program, make the people in the series so like people we all know.  It is a series I can watch and enjoy, without cars blowing up and everyone jumping into bed with everyone.  It is just a fun and enjoyable hour of really good acting.",1403049600,,278,4.111111111111111

fascinating people!  You'll love it.",1403049600,,120,4.9

2387229,5,B000AE4QD8,Love his personality and strange sense of humor.  Also like his clumsiness. Think it was great how all of the townspeople supported one of their own.,1402963200,,149,4.730769230769231
2387230,5,B000AE4QD8,"I gave it five stars because it earned them! I think it's the best britcom since keeping up appearances. The location is perfect, it has beautiful backdrops for all the scenes. American television has gotten a little too real, too much gore in their detective programs, and comedies are too P.C., they've been that way for a long time now. I don't need to be brain washed.
This program, on the other hand, provides an escape from day to day life and that's what entertainment should do! Yet, the characters are very real with their interesting foibles - a surgeon who's sickened at the sight of blood and a bedside manner somewhat impaired by Aspergers yet he has a good heart! Fortunately for him, Louisa, ever the good teacher, sees through all that and diligently brings it to his attention.
Great program!",1402963200,,809,4.704225352112676
2387231,4,B000AE4QD8,This is a very funny show and very entertaining. The language is difficult to understand at times but you do get used to it.  The viewing experience is also quite educational.  Beautiful locale.,1402876800,,194,4.848484848484849

2387233,5,B000AE4QD8,"I haven't seen season 6 yet, but otherwise, this is my favorite season, in which the characters are more nuanced, Martin actually has a clue, and everything ties together",1402790400,,170,4.896551724137931
2387234,5,B000AE4QD8,"Totally enjoyable. One feels sorry for him when he tries to interact with the village, he always blunders. Apart from that he's a brilliant doctor and comes through in a crisis. I wish there were more episodes to be seen! It's like a good book you hate to finish.",1402790400,,263,4.387755102040816

2387236,5,B000AE4QD8,"I am way behind the years in some great series and this is one of them.  Totally enjoying this curmudgeon of a small town doctor and all the other characters who live there or pass through.  Watching a series from the beginning and being able to go from episode to episode fairly quickly, certainly helps you understand the big picture.  Thank you Amazon Prime and the BBC for producing quality and entertaining programming.",1402704000,,424,4.780821917808219
2387237,5,B000AE4QD8,"This is an excellent series. The cast is very good and the story line well written. I have watched the entire six series to date and hope there will be another season this year. The two Doc Martin movie prequels are both entertaining, but are not as good as the series. The Movies portray Doc Martin (Martin Clunes)  as a somewhat aloof, Obstatrician , who gives up the big city for a small village. In the series he is a very successful surgeon in London who developed a fear of blood and had to give up his prestigious practice to accept a General Practitioner job in a small Port town. The Doc is brilliant, but very abrasive in his bed side manners.",1402704000,,653,4.352459016393443

Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) takes on (IMHO) a roll which swings from overly-overbearing to tender & caring.  And he pulls it off.  Ian McNiece (Baron Harkonnen| Children of Dune) is a pivotal character throughout the season(s), and does a great job.
My only disappointment is the character they created in the Pilot for Doc Martin is a somewhat different persona than what Clunes portrays in the Series. Oh well!",1402531200,,558,4.770833333333333

Great characters,, great acting, great stories within stories. The characters are so humanly imperfect.  It's been a long time since I have been absorbed by a program...I feel like I know these people.  Definitely recommend it ....especially if, like me, you are weary of the violence, ignorance and mindlessness of much current programming.

There is something about the seaside and greenery that is relaxing and different. At least for State-siders - where all our coasts are followed by miles of sand, heat, and tourists. Although the actual town of Port Isaac may be a tourist stop, it doesn't appear that way on camera, and it is quite refreshing.  So I went back and watched season 1 on Amazon and it really put everything together. Makes much more sense - as far as some of the characters and their relationships. I think that season one is by far the best one of all. It has much more humor in it too.",1401494400,,670,4.234375

2387329,5,B000AE4QD8,"This is what can happen if you cross ""Murder She Wrote""with ""House"" in terms of village life characters and  a doc with Aspergers and plant it in England.  I especially appreciate that the actors are  not plastic, nipped n tucked and  speak in full sentences. Martin makes  being blunt a new art form. Great antidote for the years of nauseating political correctness everywhere.",1400371200,,378,4.936507936507937
2387330,5,B000AE4QD8,"To watch this story line is so much fun. Warm, friendly and funny. The characters are true to life and seem to be typical of what you image a small village would be like. I'm looking forward to watching the whole series of Doc Martin.",1400371200,,234,4.222222222222222
2387331,5,B000AE4QD8,"Was told this was a great series.  So thrilled my Amazon Prime has it.  It is hard to find things both my 90 year mother and I both enjoy but we find Doc Martin hilarious, quirky, and touching plus the location is gorgeous!",1400284800,,223,4.162790697674419
2387332,5,B000AE4QD8,This series is truly family entertainment; it has the ups and downs of life in a small village. The characters are unique and become members of the audience's extended family. The language is viewer friendly and the episode progresses as lives unfold. A joy to view and something one enjoys as repeats.,1400284800,,302,4.826923076923077

2387335,5,B000AE4QD8,"This is a series that is very entertaining even if it is a bit prickly -  much of that coming from differences in British and American culture.  I've been watching it on and off for the last two seasons - some episodes from previous seasons as well.  The first year my wife was watching it and I kept it at arm's length.  But the second year I began looking forward to each episode.  It has good acting and decent story lines, some better than others.  The characters are intriguing, especially that of Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz) - I'm a sucker, number one, for ladies with dark hair and, number two, the same with an English accent.  Doc Martin's (Martin Clune) character is off the charts peculiar and introverted, with good reason given the character development.",1400025600,,770,4.659259259259259

A special treat in a jaded world.",1400025600,,272,5.27906976744186
2387337,5,B000AE4QD8,It is awesome to be able to watch Doc Martin on my iPad free with Prime.  It is easier to catch all the nuances which often gets missed on TV.  I'm on to Season 2.,1400025600,,163,3.6285714285714286

2387339,4,B000AE4QD8,I like this series because it not a typical cookie cutter plot line.  A misanthropic physician forced by his personal phobia to deal with a cast of eccentric ordinary patients.,1399939200,,176,4.866666666666666
2387340,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is a man you hate to love, but you just can't help it.

2387347,5,B000AE4QD8,After watching the first season I was hooked on this series with its colorful characters.  The title character is all at once shockingly blunt but subtle in his appeal that grows from the beginning.  By the time you finish this first season you are totally hooked but glad you waited to get hooked.  This way you can savor the experience through 6 series before you start paying for the episodes.

2387368,5,B000AE4QD8,From the beginning it is clear that this is going to be a series I want to watch. I think the chemistry between Martin and Louisa is the thing that pulls you in straight away.

It is a wonderful show with a talented cast.",1399248000,,274,4.055555555555555
2387376,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is a pleasant departure from the other choices that are offered as Tv fare currently. Though series is a bit dated though, Season 1 was released around 2004. The scenery is worth the view all by itself. The Cornwall blend of landscape and seascape is just beautiful. Mix in the quaint old architecture and narrow streets made for horse and carts initially and you have a pleasant visual escape in every episode.

The characters are quirky and interesting and the situations in which they find themselves range from hilarious to frightening. It is refreshing to watch intelligent dialogue and become involved and interested in the people and and how they live their somewhat ordinary lives in this close knit community of diverse types. After each episode we looked forward to the next one and were not disappointed in any of the 1st season's chapters. Our intent is to watch each succeeding season and we will do that at a leisurely pace in order to savor and discuss each episode as we have done for the first season.",1399248000,,1029,4.748603351955308

2387378,5,B000AE4QD8,"This is like a modern day James Harriet series...plenty of interesting characters...and full of surprises.

2387383,4,B000AE4QD8,"Found this series by accident, but fell in love with the show, the characters, the scenery.  Just now going backwards and catching up w/Season One. Gave it 4 stars, only because the Receptionist Elaine annoys me to no end, and the Doc is mean to dogs. I love dogs - they have a much better disposition than people.  Enjoy this show very much.",1399075200,,342,4.412698412698413
2387384,5,B000AE4QD8,"I feel about Doctor Ellingham (don't call me Doc Martin) exactly like the English village chemist does when she said, ""I could eat him with a spoon."" The good doctor was a surgeon in London until he couldn't stand the sight of blood and became the village of Portwinn's general practitioner. He is brilliant, he is rude (like most surgeons) and he does not fit in with the village people who are as quirky as anyone you ever met and are wonderful characters. Definitely well worth your time to watch but know you will get hooked.",1398988800,,529,4.520833333333333

2387391,5,B000AE4QD8,Absolutely love this series. In the past few years I have only caught a few episodes on PBS. With Amazon Prime we are able to start from the beginning and fill in the details we have been missing all along. This show is a breath of fresh air with  the ability to whisk you away to the Cornwall region of the UK. I especially like not previously knowing the actors so that the characters seem real. The humor maybe tailored to UK and us older US folks. Not sure my grown kids appreciate this type of programming.,1398902400,,511,4.268041237113402
2387392,5,B000AE4QD8,Took me a while to get into this program but then really enjoyed it... so many shows are just new versions of old themes. This seems to be innovative and well acted.

2387396,5,B000AE4QD8,I like the humor. I like the Cornish coastal scenery. Very cleverly made situation and interactions showing differences/contrast between a Londoner and rural English people.

2387398,5,B000AE4QD8,Missed this series when it came out a couple years ago and I caught a show from year 4 so I was glad to be able to go back and start from the beginning. While each show is a stand alone show there is a continuing plot from previous episodes. Acting and script is superb. Light hearted English humor and great if not quirky relationships.,1398643200,,337,4.2

2387412,5,B000AE4QD8,"For an American Anglophile just the scenery of seaside Cornwall is a treat. However, the attraction goes deeper, and more universally, into the lives of people who try to tolerate one another's idiosyncrasies while they ferret out village secrets - of which there seem to be few that last. In Doc Martin's irascible character we are confronted with our own fears of being disliked, yet we are comforted because, despite his inept social skills, we like him anyway, just the way we hope others feel about us. And there is also his rather super-human ability to diagnose and cure all human complaints so long as he is not weakened by his earthly kryptonite - blood.  Through it all, he and Louisa (Superdoc's Lois Lane) keep us off balance as we root for each of them to overcome their shortsighted focus on the other's flaws and regain their initial blinding heat of passion. Well, that sounds like a universal romantic longing, too. Maybe the show set in Cornwall could really be about anywhere. And that is its true charm.",1398297600,,1023,4.747191011235955

2387417,3,B000AE4QD8,"Ostensibly about an unlikable, highly successful, big city, vascular surgeon who retreats to a small and charming village as a GM because he develops an aversion to the smell and sight of blood. Doc Martin is socially inept (from years of cutting himself off from his real feelings, it is apparent) and at first, unapproachable. The viewer is given to believe it is the lovable although kooky townspeople who will put him right.  However, as the series progresses and the doctor begins to adjust to his situation, I find the characters of the town to be less simple/quaint/eccentric than obnoxious - some of them ignorant bordering on dangerously ignorant. Is this how small town people truly are? I hope not? Seems strangely unbelievable and manipulative to me.

Anyway, difficult to continue watching when you don't really like the characters. I especially find the so-called receptionist impossible to stomach. In the end, the two I most cared about were the good doctor and his guardian angel, the homeless dog.",1398124800,,1015,5.035714285714286

The Doc is irritable, clueless regarding social cues, and somehow attractive at the same time.  A slice of small town life in this seaside community.  As a middle-aged male, I LOVE Louissa!!  Her physical beauty and her compassionate personality have a strong  ""pull"" and complement Ellingham's acerbic nature. Her character brings the humanity to the series.  Well done!!",1397865600,,524,5.240963855421687

After giving up his London surgical practice, he becomes the GP in Port Wen, a little fishing village in Cornwall on the English southwest coast.  To say he's ""prickly"" and totally lacking interpersonal skills is an understatement.  On the other hand, in every episode he manages to save one or more of the villagers from themselves, while also clumsily pursuing Louisa, a local school teacher.  Extremely entertaining, usually funny, and often surprising!",1397520000,,574,5.195652173913044

2387459,4,B000AE4QD8,I enjoyed the characters.  It is sensitive and funny at the same time. Themes did begin to get a bit predictable and repetitive.,1397433600,,128,4.565217391304348

2387462,4,B000AE4QD8,"If you know anyone whom you deem insensitive to others feelings, your irritation with that person will rise.  While Doc Martin in rude, insensitive and probably suffers from Asperger's, he is also very keen to diagnose and bring healing to his clients.  Sometimes he is a world away from even being courteous yet it appears to be funny.  Other characters add to the enjoyment like Aunt Joan who embodies all the love Martin's mother never exhibited, the father and son plumbers, the very sweet and tender school teacher Louisa.  If you're interested in health issues Doc Martin sees them all:  infertility, low testaterone,knee replacement, narcolepsy, pregnancy and accident causing hemorages while he has a phobia at the sight of blood.  This is an unusual comedy, spiced by real life predicaments, beautiful coastal scenery and colorful people.",1397347200,,847,5.1911764705882355

The series, which has run six seasons in the U.K. and fans are wishing for a seventh, features memorably very human characters,  a lovely setting, and situations and relationships that are both surprising and believable, which is a hard balance to achieve. High recommended, if your taste runs to human dramas touched by wit and, at times, eccentricity.",1397260800,,619,4.951923076923077

If you enjoy a show that ridicules everyone - I guess then you can't say it's making fun of any particular segment of the population - then go for it. My personal experiences are such that I made it through a couple of episodes and then took it off my Prime Watchlist. I'll keep on enjoying Ballykissangel, instead.",1397088000,,483,4.318681318681318

Martin Clune is perfect as the completely grumpy but incredible talented GP.  His cluelessness about social interactions just adds humor to the escapades of the quirky villagers. The way he says ""Shut up!"" makes my day. Yet you will love this man by the time you watch a few episodes because he lives his life the best he can with the lot that has been put before him. I believe people who know others who are on the Autism Spectrum (even though no one says he is) will feel heartened and hopeful that there is a place in the world for such unique individuals.",1397088000,,680,4.330708661417323

2387485,4,B000AE4QD8,"'Doc Martin' is one of those shows, I have found that gets better as it ages. However, the first year was very entertaining. There was something a little hit strange about he main character, Doc Martin, played by Martin Clunes, but, since he was a surgeon, that made some sense.

Dr. Martin Ellingham, a  London surgeon developed a horrible reaction to the sight of blood. He also dies not have a good bedside manner, and he looks for another job. A GP is needed in a small village in a Cornish fishing village. He had spent summers there and, indeed, loved the area.

Martin was written and created by Dominic Minghella.  Martin became the charmless, and insensitive physician, who is a brilliant diagnostician. He is so impossible I felt myself rooting for him. He is an off beat but good man. Once he is in the village, he sets up an office, people come by just to see him, and then they all develop unusual conditions, that he can almost always solve. In the process he falls in love with the schoolteacher Louisa, played by Carolyn Catz. She discovers she is attracted to him, but she doesn't really like him.

Every week a new medical condition is discovered, often including a interesting storyline.  Doc Martin gains weight and loves the town. The town is an intricate turn of hillside streets and scenic overlooks. The town characters are the receptionists Lucy Punch and Katherine Parkinson; Ian McNeice, as a plumber ; Joe Absolom as McNeice's  son; Stewart Wright and John Marquez as police constables,  and Stephanie Cole as Martin's stubborn Aunt Joan.  I began to think quite often that Doc Martin has Aspergers. He has all the characteristics. But, it makes no difference, really. This is a character who has soul, a romantic comedy we can all relate to.

I like this series because even though there is two years between each season; the first episode of each season picks up from the last episode of the last season. This creates a continuity that rarely exist in a television series. It keeps you wanting more. I can barely wait for season seven.

2387504,5,B000AE4QD8,"Ok, so I am a hardcore lover of BBC, have been for more years than I care to share. PBS has offered BBC comedies for decades now, however this is the most recently produced series available on PBS to date (at least in our area).  When our local PBS station went into it's month-long fund-raising they stopped the regular programming and we decided to watch this series via Apple TV instead (and Amazon's Prime video app). The PBS station was showing the episodes out of order (very annoying since it is a cumulative story line) which was another reason we wanted to be able to watch the series in order.  There are currently 6 seasons out, with the first being aired in 2004 and Season 6 aired in the fall of 2013.  According to internet news,  there WILL be one additional season made, to tie up the story lines, but at this time it is unclear whether it will air in 2014 or 2015.

Technical Notes:  We had some difficulty with Amazon Prime's video streaming dying in the first five minutes of many of these episodes. Not sure if it is attributable to this series, Amazon's app, or possibly the Apple TV.  If this happens, you may have to restart the video several times before it runs properly. The opening credits are displayed faster than when watching these episodes on regular tv - maybe Amazon is trying to save bandwidth, not sure, but it is the fast forward during the opening credits that is causing the streaming to fail I am sure.",1396310400,3,1442,4.480916030534351

If you've seen the movies that preceded the series, you'll notice some changes (Martin's last name and personal history, primarily), but I think the series is even better than the movies.

Some episodes deal with mature subject matter, so it's not for the whole family, but the subjects are handled sensitively by the writers (if not by Doc Martin himself). I think fans of Big Bang Theory will find a lot to enjoy about this show, and vice versa.",1395878400,,616,4.651376146788991

2387553,4,B000AE4QD8,"This is a terrifically funny and sometimes moving series about a famous London surgeon (Martin Clunes) who suddenly becomes nauseated at the sight and smell of blood and must therefore take his skills elsewhere, specifically to a beautiful village on the English Cornish coast called Port Wenn. The series is British, of course, because we simply do not do this kind of romantic comedy in America, where the hero must look like George Clooney (jug-eared Doc Martin, who walks like C3PO in Star Wars, is light years from George) and the characters are drawn in black and white rather than many shades of gray. And thank you, BBC (or whoever produced it), for NOT having a laugh track, which I cannot abide. Doc Martin reminds me of a doctor I once had who, after being called by my wife because of a relative's hugely elevated blood pressure, asked her, ""And what is so wrong that makes you think you can call me on a weekend?"" After being taken aback, she responded, ""Because you are the doctor on call this weekend, lest you have forgotten!"" We dumped him as our GP, but in Port Wenn that would be an typical response from dear old Doc Martin, and few of his patients would expect anything different from their cranky GP. Doc Martin's very appealing love interest in the village is the local school teacher, Louisa (Caroline Catz), a beautiful and conflicted woman who says more with her eyes and facial expressions than words (or other actresses) can ever convey. Amazingly, viewers grow to love this curmudgeonly character, who is a great physician but has the fatal flaw of expecting others to view the world in the logical, orderly, unemotional way he does.",1395273600,,1662,4.73448275862069

I will admit much of it was over my head since I was without any context from previous seasons. I wasn't all that impressed but was told to give it another try. So, I figured I'd better start at season 1 episode 1. I was almost immediately hooked.

From the first episode, I've been transfixed not only by the stunning scenery of this seaside Cornwall hamlet but also by its quirky and eccentric characters.  Doc Martin is beyond rude in a classic case of Nature and nurture.  Louisa, the town's schoolteacher is as fascinated by him as she is repelled by his abruptness.  And every Portwenn resident has his/her own story to unfold.  I am now at the end of the second series and even more enthralled.  The only downside ""to Doc Martin"" is that it becomes an addiction and you long to relocate to this place which engenders both laughter and tears.",1394755200,,718,4.6141732283464565

2387615,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is a socially inept yet brilliant doctor who lives on the edges of both panic and anger.  He serves Port Isaac in Cornwall, on the south west corner of England.  Unlike most doctors, Martin tends to faint at the sight of blood, a phobia he fights constantly.  At the same time, he ministers to his patients with a mixture of  dismay and incredulity, wondering, with a shake of his head, how they could be so wrong-headed while they wonder how he could be so cold and at the same time, such a fine doctor.  Much of the time they refuse to believe his diagnoses, which always leads to complications and unforeseen difficulties.  In the meantime, and despite his dicey reputation, he manages to keep his patients as healthy as possible, even to the point of ignoring the high school girls who tease and mimic his stiff walk and startled look as often as possible.  This is a wonderful portrayal of mismatched couples and colleagues, neighbors and nay-sayers, almost friends and well-meaning relatives.  This series promises to be addictive.  Who could ask for more!",1394236800,,1073,4.756756756756757

Martin Clunes is outstanding in his portrayal of the formerly London surgeon who cannot deal with blood. Every character is well thought out, and the acting is superb. Especially charming is Louisa, the village school teacher. It's hard to believe the doc can fall in love, but he does!

They are funny, strange, loveable, and unpredictable!  We like the fact that there is a story line to follow and it isn't all comedy.  We like the interaction between the Doctor and the teacher from the school.  It is charming and fun to watch.  We want to watch all the seasons!",1393718400,,448,4.325301204819277

2387654,3,B000AE4QD8,"The multiple versions of this series confused the hell out of me. The ensemble of key characters is limited in number, so behavior is bent and stretched to make the point. Acting is good and at times a scene can be touching, but in the final analysis it's simply another Martin Clunes' British Series.",1393545600,,301,4.592592592592593

2387656,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is an unusual but ultimately likeable character. He is socially ill at ease and priggishly high on himself, based on to his past identity as a surgeon in the big city. But the people and lifestyle of his provincial new home in Port Wenn acts as a chisel to his ego as he fulfills his role as a general medical doctor. Supporting characters (the pretty teacher, who offers intrigue as a potential love interest -- and his feisty receptionist, who does pretty much as she pleases) are strong. Very enjoyable! Each episode draws you further in to the story. I'm happy to be coming late to this show, because I like it very much and know that there are five more seasons to catch up on and enjoy!",1393545600,,703,4.415384615384616

I am hooked on this show!",1393372800,,335,4.6

2387675,5,B000AE4QD8,"I can't believe I'm saying this because I was put off from watching the series because the lead is physically unappealing to me, but Doc Martin is a visual and intellectual treat! The townspeople characters, although often seeming a little one-sided, are delightful to watch against the curmudgeonly, but brilliant doctor. From the irrepressible secretary to the insecure police officer to the no-skill plumber, Doc Martin is surrounded human foibles that he cannot tolerate, despite his own - hemophobia. The seamless connection between the interior and exterior shots taking place in the Cornwall seaside village is unmatched.",1393372800,,628,5.484536082474227

2387689,5,B000AE4QD8,"I love this show. Small town intrigue. Lots of quirky personalites. The doctor is a unique character, so he fits in with the other residents, though he would never admit it. His long suffering girfriend has my sympathy.  Port Isaac setting is scenic and adds to the appeal.

2387707,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin just does not fit in and I guess as was pointed out at the end of the season, perhaps that is okay.  The program is smart, funny and well conceived.  Where elements come across originally as stereotypical, in the end they in their own way do not seem trite.  I do love the dog too.  It is a simple, heartwarming element to the story.",1392940800,,344,4.166666666666667

I think the writing is witty and fun and all involved should win awards!  Clunes is great as always (obviously)!!! But, he has some great help from others such as John Marquez (PC Penhale - Seasons 3-6),  Lucy Punch (Elaine - Season 1) and Ian McNeice and Joe Absolom (Bert and Al Large - Seasons 1-6).  The show is addicting really, something which bodes well for everyone's retirement plan who owns a piece of it!!!",1392854400,,560,4.514851485148514
2387714,5,B000AE4QD8,We just started watching last month and we are already in the middle of Season 4. Very enjoyable! I would love to live in a quirky village like Portwen. Best british sit-com I have ever watched.,1392854400,,194,4.416666666666667

2387717,5,B000AE4QD8,This series is unlike most situation episodes. It is compelling in every way as you watch the characters develop. My husband who never watches a series is in to this one. If I have a criticism it would be that maybe too many subplots are developing.,1392854400,,249,4.434782608695652
2387718,5,B000AE4QD8,"I had almost given up on watching TV shows when I discovered Doc Martin.  This series is concept, big city person moves to small town, has been done frequently.  But, few times has it been done with the richness of characters, plot, or scenery.  Honestly, I'm going to get a HDTV just so I can appreciate the panorama of the Cornwall countryside.  This series is not slapstick or silly humor, this is authentic humor of characters you will recognize in your everyday life.",1392854400,,472,4.650602409638554

2387720,5,B000AE4QD8,"Excentric Doc Martin isn't your normal protagonist; although he does win you over.  The characters of Portwenn are funny and endearing, and the scenery is amazing.  Great stpry lines keep you wanting more, for a well deserved 5 star rating.",1392854400,,240,4.975
2387721,5,B000AE4QD8,Very interesting characters & stories. Martin Clunes face speaks many words. He is the show. Quite entertaining and engaging. A+++,1392854400,,130,5.55

2387727,5,B000AE4QD8,Really a must see for Doc Martin fans as the basis is set up that explains a great deal for future episodes even seasons later.  Enjoy this series immensely.,1392768000,,157,4.413793103448276
2387728,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is maddeningly entertaining. I want to shake him furiously, but at the same time I feel sad for him. I hope there will be a Season 7.",1392681600,,144,4.0

2387736,4,B000AE4QD8,"If you need a ""real belly laugh"" you'll want to watch this, but if you shy away from rudeness, you'll not find it humorous.  The star actor is a practicing physician who is totally rude to the community he services, even the cute school teacher he has taken a fancy too.  All of the characters appear so real in this little community in the UK.  There day to day activities and behavior will leave you laughing throughout each episode.  I must say, if you fancy a laugh, just give it a view.",1392681600,,491,4.304347826086956

2387738,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is one of the funniest show I've ever watched.  Not made up humor, but down rite, no social skills, laugh out loud funny.  He can take a perfectly normal situation and with his lack of social skills turn it into a very amusing situation. I'm on the second season now and it is just as good.",1392681600,,301,4.172413793103448
2387739,5,B000AE4QD8,This show has a unique mix of drama and comedy. I love it's quirkiness. Unpredictable. British TV at it's best.,1392681600,,111,4.6

2387743,5,B000AE4QD8,"You see I did not get this season 1 as I planned because of Amazon's very confusing ""new"" buy by episode. I thought I was  going to buy season one. But I didn't because it was late at night and I was tired and affraid that I might make a mistake! Well some how a mistake was made anyway!! I get up the following morning and find that one episode was indeed ordered! I furiously looked for a phone number to cancel said order. I finally found one. The order is cancelled but now I am gun shy as to ordering the whole season for fear I might make the same mistake again. This ""new"" per-episode designed for ones computer or iPad stinks Amazon and you should make entire separate section in which to order this way. I know you won't heed the advise of ONE person so, it leaves me no other choice but to find another on line source for my movies, sorry!",1392595200,,849,4.1454545454545455
2387744,5,B000AE4QD8,A very mild series but very entertaining. One to relax to. It is so refreshing to have something to watch that you aren't wondering every minute about who is going to kill who & who is going to run around naked any minute. Always has a good story & the cast does great. Dr. Martin does a really great job. He is so human. Always into trouble like a little kid because that's the way men are. Yet he is a man & it kicks in when needed. We hope this series stays on for a long time.,1392508800,,480,3.9081632653061225

2387746,5,B000AE4QD8,The Brits seem to select actors for acting ability and role placement and not just looks. I find this refreshing. Doc Martin is of course an outrageously rude and neurotic doctor but I suspect he says things to his patients that many doctors would like to say at times but are too polite to do so. Doc Martin is well worth watching but be forewarned----It's addictive.,1392508800,,368,4.590909090909091
2387747,5,B000AE4QD8,"The first season of Doc Martin really got us hooked, and we fell in love with the characters quickly.  The Doc Martin character differs quite a bit from some of the earlier pilots we've seen, which I think adds to the quirky nature of the show.  The location they used to film is so beautiful it makes me want to pick-up and move there.  If you enjoy British humor you'll love this series.",1392508800,,389,4.301369863013699

2387760,5,B000AE4QD8,"I was recently introduced to the program and decided to go back to the first season so I could get the background on all of the characters from this quaint little town.

2387762,5,B000AE4QD8,Liked what I could get on PBS but nothing was in order and mostly became re-runs. So discouraging.  Was glad to find the whole series on Amazon Prime and have enjoyed watching.,1392249600,,176,4.5

Conflict inevitably arises but, of course, when push comes to shove Doc always saves the day. Predictable enough but not necessarily a bad plot device in itself. The problem is neither Doc nor the secondary characters are all that appealing. Not appealing enough anyway to watching the rest of the series.",1392249600,,435,4.8133333333333335

2387775,4,B000AE4QD8,"For American audiences this show is very British.  Personally, I think that is a good point.  The main character is sort of a grizzled young doctor, a surgeon, who moves to a small community from the big city because he suddenly develops an aversion to blood.  All he wants to do is practice small town medicine.  He keeps getting dragged into situations with the townsfolk who view their doctor as an elder of sorts.  The story is about the struggle of one man's dedication to medicine only and the town's humanity.  He melts from time to time and even finds love. Each show starts with ice and ends with warm English tea.

Watch a few episodes.",1392163200,,646,4.517241379310345

If you aren't familiar with it - Doc Martin is a doctor moving from London to Port Wenn - and changing his life around. Lets just say that Doc makes Clint Eastwood look like a chatterbox - he may not have a lot of bedside manner - but he is an ace doctor. Both the Doc and the townspeople have a lot adjustments to make. It is cute, smart. upbeat, and we always feel better after watching! It is a nice tonic for the middle of the winter.",1391817600,,602,3.8548387096774195

2387804,5,B000AE4QD8,Very fun and entertaining show with positive themes. Good for all ages. Life in coastal small town England is very gossipy and close-knit. Stories are all very good. Acting is first-rate. Two thumbs up!,1391731200,,202,4.970588235294118
2387805,5,B000AE4QD8,"Don't miss this series.  This is what I love about BBC.  They have great stories and terrific actors.  This series and season 1 is sad, funny and makes you glad to be part of the human race.",1391731200,,190,4.081081081081081
2387806,5,B000AE4QD8,I'm addicted to and fascinated by Doc Martin. I myself am a doctor and found out about the show from a patient and from the first episode of season 1 was hooked. All the characters are quirky and fun and I love trying to figure out the puzzle of the diagnosis du jour. I am also impressed by the medical accuracy that disappoints me in other shows.

The quaint village and the characters are spot-on.  Can't imagine anyone but Martin Clunes playing the title role.  Delightful Louisa played by Caroline Catz is perfect.  I would love to visit the real village.  Perfect location..  Hope there is a Season Seven.",1391558400,,421,4.763888888888889

2387814,5,B000AE4QD8,Doc Martin if a very quirky show. The character is a cross between House M.D. and Bones. You grow to love him despite his mannerisms. I would suggest watching the two movies that came before the series also.,1391558400,,207,4.473684210526316

2387816,4,B000AE4QD8,"Although it's the same actor, the character of Doc Martin in this original TV movie is the polar opposite of the aloof, testy character in the TV series. Here he's a lovable, goofy nebbish. They changed his last name and personal background, as well as the location, for the subsequent long-running series. Still worth watching though.",1391558400,,335,5.0

2387820,5,B000AE4QD8,I love everything about Doc Martin.  Every character is beautifully drawn and Dr. Ellingham himself is so awful you can't help loving him.  I had seen a few episodes on PBS and desperately wanted more.  I was so excited to find all the seasons available on Amazon Prime and have started from the very beginning.  I'm already dreading running out!,1391472000,,346,4.716666666666667

2387825,5,B000AE4QD8,"I am a real fan of Britcoms. I have only seen one that took some time for me to warm up to, but I finally did. ""Doc Martin"" was not that series. I became a fan from the get-go. If you remember the American series ""Northern Exposure"" (and you liked it) then you will probably like this. Both make-believe towns are peopled by incredible odd ball characters . NE was more serious than DM, but DM has its moments, too. I started watching on PBS, but could not get enough and sometimes missed episodes, so Prime is perfect for me. This is very well done; the acting is fantastic and the location is beautiful.

2387829,5,B000AE4QD8,Why can't the US entertainment industry come up with anything this good.  I was hooked from the first episode.  US television is old hack and it can't come up with an original premises to save it's dull and repetitive life.  Give me British telly every time!!,1391299200,,259,4.586956521739131

2387834,5,B000AE4QD8,"I love this show.  It's funny, has interesting, imperfect characters, beautiful scenery.  So 5 stars. But for the Amazon streaming, there is much work to be done.  I can't get it to play on my smart tv at all, and even had trouble watching it on my laptop.  I am not a total technophobe, and I did try downloading the newest version of silverlight, but all I can say is that EVERY time I try to stream from Amazon, it's at least a few minutes of confusion and frustration, while the competitor, the one that begins with ""N"" and ends with ""X"", always works without a problem.  Every time.  Not sure what gives with Amazon.  Figure it out please.",1391299200,,644,4.361344537815126

2387837,5,B000AE4QD8,The villagers are very accepting of the odd duck Doc Martin. It's so fun to see him totally clueless about the normal village life.,1391126400,,131,4.5
2387838,5,B000AE4QD8,Doc Martin is such a loveable curmudgeon. Love the series!  Enough said -- Why does Amazon require a certain number of words for a review?,1391126400,,138,4.52
2387839,5,B000AE4QD8,I enjoyed it totally. Would love to continue watching future stories. Very quirky doctor but interesting characters and stories. Cant wait to continue watching,1391126400,,159,5.666666666666667

2387845,4,B000AE4QD8,"The Brits just do a better job at subtle humor than Americans.  All the actors get a turn at being the focus of the story.
And, how nice it is to watch a program without advertising every 10 minutes.",1391040000,,199,4.102564102564102
2387846,5,B000AE4QD8,"This is definitely a comedy and 90% of it is pure funny.

He went to see the doc for bruising, and had a long history of injuries. We watch Doc Martin with caution now and some disappointment and certainly would not recommend it for children. No further disagreeable scenes and we are in Season2. If we find another we won't watch it anymore. We found another series called ""Lark Rise to Candlewood"". Very interesting with great scenery, interesting plots and a good family series.",1391040000,,541,4.645833333333333

relaxing to watch rather than sitting on the end of your seat.

Doc Martin makes mistakes as well brings out the humanity in
all of us.",1390953600,,268,4.489795918367347

2387866,4,B000AE4QD8,I love Doc Martin.  The setting is beautiful and the characters are wonderfully wacky.  Doc Martin is a little lacking on people skills but he is a very caring person underneath the somewhat gruff exterior. He seems to be a great doctor.  It is an excellent light comedy in the British style. I have already started watching the second season.,1390867200,,343,4.683333333333334

It's NOT a Martin Clunes silly Brit type comedy (we don't like those), but there ARE very humorous situations. Really LOVE the whole ""Portwenn"" gang. We might even visit.

so I won't go into that. I watched season 3 first -- I received
season 3 as a Christmas present. When I read the description
of the series on the back of the box, I wasn't sure if I'd like it.
That description makes the series sound kind of campy or
madcap. If that's also your concern, rest assured that this
series is funny, but not silly. Yes, the characters are unusual
people, but truth is stranger than fiction.
I also went on googlemaps and looked at Port Isaac! You can
""walk"" down the same streets yourself -- pretty cool.",1390867200,,591,4.285714285714286

2387878,5,B000AE4QD8,Will hate to see the final episode. Have loved every moment of watching from Season 1 right through Season 6.  Can't beat  British humor.,1390867200,,137,4.666666666666667
2387879,5,B000AE4QD8,"An interesting character in a believable situation. I like the understated plots, and the focus on human foibles and how they are overcome by circumstance. I also just think they found the perfect mix of Felix Unger and Ebeneezer GetOffMyLawn... I like interesting characters dealing with the real world in ways I had never considered .... If you are the type that must have Channing Tatum  and  Vin Diesel driving nitro-injected Prius' into giant exploding nuclear cricket-bots with ironic t-shirts and the chick that played meg in family guy's nipples, I suspect you should stay far away from it...but  glad to have stumbled across it on a trip to London last April",1390867200,,667,4.9375

The romance between Doc and the teacher is funny, he's hopeless when it comes to relate to others. Hilarious, jajajaj",1390608000,,210,4.552631578947368
2387882,5,B000AE4QD8,"Thats right!  I hate Reruns! But I love Doc Martin, any episode, any time!

He's not exactly Prince Charming, in fact he is about the most socially awkward man on tv  but he might be the best doctor in the world.  He WILL save his patients whether they like him or cooperate or not!  Everytime he tells someone to do exactly as he says, I keep waiting for them to punch him rather than just look afronted and scurry away like wounded puppies.  No matter how obnoxious he is they can't deny the fact that he knows what he's doing and they trust him with thier lives even if they make fun of him behind his back.

I'd actually like to see his love interest Louisa Glasson stand up to him just once with more than a scolding  for treating her like an old shoe. How deeply she loves him and keeps giving him second, third and millionth chances is actually what the makes the series so endearing.  I love watching her kiss him, closing her eyes and peeking to see if the frog has turned in to a prince yet! :p

Despite his gruff exterior and unimpressive manners, Doc has a kind of charisma that keeps me coming back for more. His brilliant mind tunes in instantly to any illness and he's quite the hero saving lives and looking like a fool in the interim with his adversion to blood!  Easy to do considering in almost every episode it seems to shoot out like a gusher everytime someone walks in the office!

I wonder if he will ever figure out how to cure his own maladies?  Not just the hemoglobin heebeegeebees.  You know the ones I am talking about.  Hoof in mouth disease.  Shut-up-itis. Lets don't forget the ""how the heck did you get pregnant Weeza, I'm a doctor, not a daddy!""

Port Wenn is a beautiful island, the people there enjoy a way of life that most of us can only dream of.  Peaceful, laid back, generations of families living and dying there, everyone knows each other from day one, they might even be kin.

Its like stepping in to another world filled with new surprises every day.  Just when you think they couldn't take the series another step forward the new season leaves you on the edge of your chair wide eyed and laughing at their antics.

Doc Martin has a very addictive and entertaining storyline.  I am collecting all the series from start to finish for my video library!",1390608000,,2295,4.375886524822695

2387894,5,B000AE4QD8,"I enjoy this series, as it is not only entertaining & fun to watch, but gives you a window into how people behave & eventually, why they do what they do.  It is a kind of character study, showing the complex interactions of people living closely with others who are all a little dysfunctional, but basically good - so much like most of us.  We keep hoping people will change, but as this show reveals, our characters are slow to do much changing from our original natures.  It has good story lines, each one woven with bits of the previous, leaving us wanting more.",1390348800,,565,4.413461538461538
2387895,5,B000AE4QD8,"I have enjoyed Doc Martin tremendously.  The character Doc Martin first appeared in a movie, Saving Grace, which is also good fun.  The mishaps in the village of Portwenn in Cornwall are true to life, amusing and worth the time.  I plan to watch all the seasons of Doc Martin.",1390348800,,276,4.48
2387896,4,B000AE4QD8,"Cute show.  Very reminiscent of Northern Exposure, Ballykissangel and others of the sort.  (A socially awkward professional leaves the big city and moves to a small village with quirky inhabitants and a potential love interest).  A complete lack of sex, violence, and foul language make it refreshing and safe for the whole family.

2387897,3,B000AE4QD8,"Dr. Ellingham's personality will grow on you.  The schtick with the airbags is very good.  And like every ensemble cast, there is that one character that drives you nuts.  The doctor is non-social to the nth degree, but he's a first-rate diagnostician.  I found myself trying to guess the diseases before the reveal.  This is NOT like HOUSE.",1390262400,,341,4.810344827586207

2387899,5,B000AE4QD8,"I really enjoy this show.  Martin is a rather socially awkward physician who moves form London to Cornwall and really doesn't seem to care if he fits in.  He is certainly not McDreamy, but endearing anyway.",1390176000,,206,4.694444444444445

GREAT SERIES for all ages!!!",1390176000,,347,4.043478260869565
2387901,5,B000AE4QD8,"I happened upon this series on television one evening and was instantly hooked.  Doc Martin is a gruff, short-tempered misfit who is definitely a product of his upbringing.  That upbringing is explained by remarks of his wonderful Aunt Joan, his only local family member.  He is love struck almost immediately by the local schoolteacher and he is unsure what to do with this new feeling.  Martin Clunes' portrayal is spot on.  Wonderful series!",1390176000,,444,5.027397260273973

2387910,5,B000AE4QD8,Doc Martin is so fun to watch because of his quirkiness. It takes you to another place and feels like an escape for the duration of the show. Kinda of like you have gone on a little vacation. It reminds me of how I used to enjoy Nothern Exposure. A different kind of place with unique characters.,1390089600,,296,4.2105263157894735
2387911,4,B000AE4QD8,I like British series but so far I haven't found anything except Downton Abbey as good as Foyle's war which is why I am giving Doc Martin four stars instead of five.,1390089600,,165,4.1875
2387912,5,B000AE4QD8,"Maybe it's the English in me, but I love this show. It's the perfect blend of dry wit and multi-layered intelligent dialogue.

2387918,5,B000AE4QD8,The Wife and I started watching this series at the beginning of season 4 and decided this is one of the very best shows on television that's available. The characters (especially Doc Martin) will captivate you with their subtle humor and their witty one liners as well as the beautiful scenery of their little town. There's more then just humor to this series though as you'll find out when you sit down to watch it so I've said my piece and one final note to add is the Wife and I have started watching this series from the very first season and we are loving it! We can't wait for the next season!  D.Pelton,1389830400,,609,4.342105263157895

2387920,2,B000AE4QD8,"It may be funny to some, but it is quite ridiculous to others who think the best of other people.  The series takes small town quirks to a new low.  Hopefully, no place is as backwards and dumb as the series portrays.",1389830400,,217,4.142857142857143
2387921,5,B000AE4QD8,"As with most British series, the people are average looking and everyday and are real.

2387924,5,B000AE4QD8,"My brother turned me on to this show.  He had purchased the first five seasons and told me about it.  I checked it out on Amazon Prime and loved the first season.  Quirky, funny, warm, and unique.  The episodes have good story lines; however, to me, it's the inhabitants of bucolic Portwenn who make each episode so darn enjoyable.  I'm on my way to beginning Season Two and, no doubt, it will be as enjoyable as Season One.  If you have not seen Doc Martin, make an appointment to see him...he won't see you, otherwise!",1389830400,,520,4.421052631578948
2387925,5,B000AE4QD8,"I like the show because it presents recognizable human challenges and dilemmas in a gentle, very British fashion. You finish watching every episode with a feeling that you saw something deep enough to be engaging without delving so deep into depths of the human psyche that you feel drained. Funny characters, the strains of being in a small enough social setting that everyone knows everything about your life, and pretty scenery. All you need to add is a cup of tea!",1389830400,,468,4.790123456790123

In today's often hectic, fast-paced world, it's refreshing to see storytelling that's simple, witty, and engaging. The show is well written and clever.

2387993,5,B000AE4QD8,I am hooked on this quirky doctor who has a heart of gold but zero social skills. I bought this because I joined in to the PBS series late and wanted to see the episodes I missed. Portwynn is a beautiful location in Cornwall. The visuals help me to place many of the sceneds in Rosamund Pilcher's books which were frequently set in Cornwall.,1389052800,,341,4.34375

2387998,5,B000AE4QD8,"This series is about a doctor who ends up in a small village as the only doctor. As you watch the series, you realize that there are many reasons the way he is. Such as rude, not very sympathetic, and very arrogant. But you do love him in spite of it all. All the people in the village are great. Very much small village life on the coast in England.

2387999,5,B000AE4QD8,"I have enjoyed the entire six seasons of Doc Martin.  I highly recommend this series to everybody.  If you like Dr. House then you will love this British version of the quirky rude diagnostician and small town M.D.

2388000,4,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is a crusty, curt, verbally inept doctor who gets sick at the sight of blood. What makes him a sympathetic character is (1) he is a brilliant diagnostician, (2) he is a dedicated healer whether he's treating a scheduled patient in his office or if he stumbles across a medical emergency on a street corner, (3) he forces himself to do what is necessary even when blood is involved, and (4) he is genuinely puzzled when his brusque demeanor offends someone. I vacillate between wanting to shake the townspeople for being rude to him and wanting to knock some common courtesy into his thick head.",1388966400,,605,4.663551401869159
2388001,5,B000AE4QD8,"Love this show. The scenery is beautiful and Caroline Catz as Louisa is outstanding. Martin Clunes as Doc Martin has no bed side

2388010,5,B000AE4QD8,I enjoy the subtle humor of this series.  Doc has so many different ways of being rude to people but he is a brilliant doctor.  I never knew that Cornwall was viewed so snobbish lay by Londoners.,1388880000,,195,4.243243243243243

It's not because his character says all the things I wanted to say but never had the nerve - because even I wouldn't think to say some of the stuff that comes out of his mouth - it's because I can't wait to see how he can turn what most folks would see as a friendly light situation and turn it into a ranting fiasco.

2388046,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is a show with everything. Humor, drama, mystery, romance & a jerk doctor that you can't help but love. It's very well acted & grabs your attention from the very first scene in the very first episode. Doc Martin goes from being a world class surgeon to the GP of a tiny village in the Cotswolds all because of an unexpected phobia to blood that reared its ugly head during the middle of a routine surgery. He takes the job of GP in this village thinking he won't have to deal with blood, but what he doesn't expect is a town full of clumsy, accident prone people who seem to bleed a lot. Give it a try, I think you'll like it. Especially if you enjoy watching",1388275200,,670,4.2015503875969

2388062,4,B000AE4QD8,I recently cut my cable tv down to basic service and have discovered the joy of watching full series when I want. Lately I've been focusing on British tv series. Netflix doesn't provide season 1 of Doc Martin so tada - Amazon to the rescue!,1388016000,,240,4.355555555555555

2388064,4,B000AE4QD8,"I found the Doc Martin series by channel surfing one day.  And in fact, I think it was mid-season of 4, that I started with.  Well, I got hooked (as I do with most BBC television shows).  Then my wife started watching it with me, we started setting the DVR and would watch it on Sunday mornings with our coffee (we have now watched all episodes twice).  When we heard a new season was coming, we had to purchase the full series on DVD.  Thumbs-Up",1387843200,,446,4.2

2388068,4,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is not the touchy- feely humorous fare one generally anticipates from PBS so it took some getting used to.  The humor is there, but is subtle.  Doc Martin appears arrogant but it doesn't take long to realize he is honest and direct...and insecure in some areas.  This is a series that took more than one viewing before it became a 'must see'.  But it is well worth the time and effort.  The supporting players are excellent, and while the Doc brooks no fools, he could be any of us, or the person we might want to be if manners did not stop us.",1387756800,,555,4.247619047619048

2388073,5,B000AE4QD8,"Frankly, it was hard to me to get into this series at first. Then after a couple episodes, you can't help bonding with these characters. Hang in there with Doc Martin Ellingham in particular. With every season, he becomes more and more endearing. All the characters are quirky just like all of us. Quite entertaining and you'll love all the other seasons after this one. Well worth watching. Martin Clunes is amazing!!",1387670400,,418,4.819444444444445
2388074,5,B000AE4QD8,This is a cross between the British village comedy with all its strange and funny characters and a fish-out-of-water story with a little medicine thrown in. It is well acted and well written with occasional flashes of brilliance. We have watched all available series and just watched Season 1 again.,1387670400,,299,5.0

2388083,5,B000AE4QD8,"Typical British comedy, but very well done.  Quirky, and filled with characters and actors unlikely to be in an American show.

2388084,5,B000AE4QD8,"I was introduced to Doc Martin by a very close friend who recommended we tried to catch this very funny show.  After watching just one episode, we were hooked.  We fell in love with Doc Martin and all the residents of this very small, very sick (lol), town.  My only complaint about watching the first season on Amazon is that none of the shows are closed captioned, and were therefore very hard for me to fully enjoy (luckily seasons 2 through 5 are on Netflix and all are closed captioned -- but they don't have season one, which is why I had to utilized them on Amazon even without their closed captioning).

Highly recommend to Amazon that all their television shows and movies available for viewing should be closed captioned.",1387497600,,731,4.6

The premise of a renowned surgeon relegated to a small British village because of a blood phobia brings so many possible story lines.

I had only one complaint, and that was the movie-length episode ending season 2... too over the top, trying too hard to hold attention, and not quite in sync with the characters.  I'm glad season 3 went back to normal again.  I love how it bounces from drama to comedy to both, and never quite knowing just how things are going to go.  I wonder if they'll be able to keep up this momentum, but for now I'm having a great time viewing.  It's nice watching a lot of episodes in a row, and not having to wait for new ones... until I finally get caught up.  All actors are doing a great job.  I'm hooked.  And that says a lot, coming from someone who was never all that wild about tv series.  I prefer movies, or a mini-series that is complete within a few days.  I detest major cliff hangers where you have to wait a year to get answers.  Those lose my interest after the first time they do that.  It seems the outrageous cliff hanging is becoming more and more the norm.  Big mistake!  Most people don't like having to wait months or years... often forgetting what the heck they were waiting for.  Just sayin'.",1381708800,,1197,4.248888888888889

The Amazon Prime transfer process to my Vizio Wifi TV has had problems even though my internet connection is usually in excess of 30Mbps when the show is loading. The program sometimes loads very slowly and pauses and stops while watching the show. Last night I checked my internet speed cable connection on CNET and it was 45 mbps and the program still stopped and started quite a few times. My wife & I enjoy it.

This is while America's Hollywood embraces political correctness as if entertainment worth watching, their hoping Americans will pay for it, too.  Only Tom Selleck's Jesse Stone was some of the few programs that seemed to understand what was coming from across the pond. In fact without CGI, too many in Hollywood wouldn't know how to make a movie anymore.  With programs like Doc Martin and Foyle's War, I feel like I'm back into real people, real places, and real life, miles away from the junk indoctrination we too often get over here.  While I understand England's political correctness is off the charts, someone in their entertainment industry is finally getting it right.

2388209,5,B000AE4QD8,"""Doc Martin"" is the ultimate British medical comedy--a snarky doc with a well-hidden good heart.  I only discovered the series this summer although I has been on both our PBS stations for some time.  Doc is a complicated guy but a great surgeon; he has been thrown into the general practice system we meet him in because he developed a phobia against blood and could no longer practice his chosen specialty.  He loved surgery probably because he only likes his patients mute and asleep!  The town where he has been assigned [this is the nationalized medical system in Great Britain] is a beautiful little seaside town full of people you will grow to love in a short time.  He meets the intelligent and beautiful primary school teacher Louisa and and the stage is set for a wonderful series full of episodes that can be watched over and over!",1380067200,,841,4.655405405405405
2388210,5,B000AE4QD8,"A much er Doctor House with a heart underneath a gruff exterior.  Rural English seaside scenes and the town are works of art andare  characters in and of themselves.  Great character development, fine acting and well written story lines.",1380067200,,237,5.0256410256410255
2388211,5,B000AE4QD8,"Not really like the movies, the series begins again the Doc Martin saga.  This time he is portrayed as more difficult; rude, insensitive but dedicated to his work as though ther is not much else.  The character, Doc Martin, began his pratice in the last series and the town characters were developed.  Now in season two life in the little town of Portwenn begins to happen.  You get to see into Don Martin and how he may have become the way he is.  You also get to see how caring he is for this town at least whiile hes there.  This series is well worth the price.",1380067200,,564,4.224299065420561

2388217,5,B000AE4QD8,"I love this series!  Doc Martin has a horrible personality, but his absolute honesty is interesting and sometimes hilarious.  Add all the quirky characters and the dog that follows him around and it's a delightful and entertaining series.",1379721600,,238,5.2368421052631575

2388221,5,B000AE4QD8,Why do shows from the BBC have so much more character and story development than the trite stuff mostly offered on American TV?  I watch a good number of BBC dramas and recommend them highly to all of my friends/family. This one is SUPERB!!! Watch all of the back episodes on your Kindle.

2388224,5,B000AE4QD8,It reminds me of the British version of Northern Exposure combined with House.  The humor is dry and the characters are just that...characters.,1379289600,,143,5.217391304347826
2388225,5,B000AE4QD8,Doc Martin is a very quirky series that is beautifully set in a sea side village in England.

2388232,4,B000AE4QD8,Doc Martin is a hoot! The scenery in and around the little town is beautiful and the characters in the show have lots of silly quirks and foibles. It's nice to have a show to watch that's fairly light and entertaining.,1378944000,,218,4.341463414634147

I thought I was giving Prime a try for 30 days and it seems to have been for 30 miniutes,,,I was charged for Season 1, episode 1.  I don't know why and there is no way to contact anyone.  I am concerned that I won't have an opportunity to see the rest of the shows or any of the other shows I was hoping to see.  Maybe I hit the wrong button and was charged.  There doesnt seem to be any way to fix it.  If anyone reading this knows how please contact me rwcrumbler@yahoo.com .",1378339200,,538,3.935185185185185
2388245,5,B000AE4QD8,"What I like the most is that the main character wears a suit and has good posture.  I also like the fact that there is no crude or foul language used and in one episode Martin even asked his aunt not to take God's name in vain.  This observation applies to more than just season one.  This show has presented a lot of unusual characters.

All of the characters are wonderful.  The village is fascinating.  The scenery is stunning.  I watch ""reruns"" just to be there.  There are lessons to be learned and, as with any great story, you laugh, you cry, you wonder, you shake your head, and you just love it!",1378252800,,417,4.421052631578948

2388255,4,B000AE4QD8,"Those who loved the Bob Newhart show should enjoy Doc Martin. Philosophically, reminiscent of the movie ""Fuzz"" with one doctor who lives by the rules and a village that kind of makes up the rules as they go along. Very funny and often enlightening. Each episode teaches us the difference between being ""correct"" and being ""right"". I think I'd like to retire to the village of Portwenn.",1378166400,,385,4.7611940298507465

2388287,5,B000AE4QD8,"I'm not the biggest fan of British comedies or dramas, but I watched this on a whim, and it is top-notch in both categories.  As Doctor Martin Ellingham, Martin Clunes not only shows that he is a top drawer actor, but he has created one of the all-time great television characters.  The cast is rounded out by a number of other accomplished actors who in the series comprise, to say the least, a town full of offbeat, quirky characters.  As with the acting, the writing is superb.  Unlike American television, there is no gratuitous violence, gore, sex, nudity or cursing (to speak of) here, yet the series could hardly be improved upon.  My wife and I hate to see each episode end, and can't wait for the next one.  Highly, highly recommended.",1377043200,,744,4.598484848484849

Disapproving, snobby school girls roaming around, the strangeness of people out on the moor, the marbles in mouth accent--perfect. The beauty, kind people, and quirky humor is also absolutely right.

This is a charming program, highlighting the life of Doc Martin and his neighbors in a small English village, where he serves as the town physician.  The scenery is just magnificent, and the opportunities to go inside the homes of the various neighbors, is a pure delight.  While the program and story line is greatly entertaining with subtle humor, the marvelous insight into the people of this village and how they live, is wonderful!  And I must add that viewing this program, as well as others, on my Kindle Fire is better than seeing it on a large screen, as the smaller screen allows for a greater feeling of intimacy and enjoyment as you are able to see the fine details of facial expressions, costuming, and details of the surrounding landscapes and inside rooms!

Martin Clunes plays Dr. Martin Ellingham, a gifted surgeon who lost his 'nerve', and became a small town GP. Martin lacks certain social 'skills' and the series runs with this.
Clunes is a naturally funny guy playing a straight, dry character and does it so well. The supporting cast of characters and the small town only add entertainment.
Try 3 or 4 early episodes and you may find yourself hooked. We were.

He has no patience for people or animals or anything, for that matter.  The series concerns the life and times of a surgeon who was dismissed from his occupation because he developed a fear of blood.  He relegates himself to general practice in a small coastal town, where he essentially alienates himself from the community as a brilliant doctor but a disgusting and offensive human being.  The writing and acting are superb and as the series progresses very tiny changes occur that reveal that under his very rough exterior there exists the smallest spark of humanity.

Doc Martin is a real grump, with absolutely no bedside manner whatsoever. That said, this is a remarkably funny and heartwarming series. Despite the lack of bedside manner, the gruff shell, and Doc's retching at the site of blood, he is a character you really want so see over and over.

Being a series from England, you have to work through the accents and occasional phrases and terms (his doctor's office is called a ""surgery""). Even so, the series is easy to warm up to, and you get to liking all of the local characters. Good cast, entertaining stories centered on a beautiful seaside village.

Doc Martin is a fully developed character. To anyone who meets him, he seems to be grumpy and curmudgeonly, but as you get to know him throughout the show, you see that he is almost disabled by his inability to relate to people. It makes him seem to be a real person to whom one can relate.

It's about a successful British surgeon from London that suddenly develops an aversion to blood.  He gives up his practice and becomes a general practitioner in a small village in Cornwall.  There are the usual assortment of wacky village types (kind of like ""Green Acres,"" but in a good way) and the scenery is breathtaking.  The doctor also is a brilliant diagnostician and has an uncanny ability to diagnose someone just by looking at them, usually when the would-be patient is lecturing him or being obnoxious.  My whole family is enjoying the series. Check it out!",1373846400,,656,4.927272727272728

Doc Martin starts off hating the village and the local hicks (being used to London for so long) but through each episode you see him softening and starting to like the place.
The cast of characters gels well, especially his air headed secretary and makes this a good comedy.  Its not as funny as men behaving badly but still a well written series and worth watching.",1373328000,,690,4.348837209302325

Doc is a former surgeon who has developed a phobia to blood so he has become a general practitioner in a small village with lots of interesting characters.

He is awkward, blunt, unfriendly and an excellent doctor, and definitely uncomfortable with the ladies.  This makes for very hilarious exchanges with his patients.

Also fun to try and anticipate what will happen next.  Hard to do since you just never know.  And that Doc Martin - there's no one like him.  Not lovable really, but you enjoy watching and seeing the scrapes he gets into and how he gets through them.  He's a true eccentric, but very human.

I can't wait for the final season to air. I have heard from some friends that they found the repetitiveness tedious after a while, but they likely didn't marathon the episodes like I did. The show mixes comedy and drama very well, though I occasionally feel sorry for the townspeople of Port Wenn, who are often the targets of jokes and made to look like fools. Still, for all that the doc himself loathes their idiocy, he and the viewer warm up to the locals... eventually.

I've always loved Caroline Catz and Stephanie Coles (and Ian McNeice!) but the actor in the title role was new to me.

2388418,5,B000AE4QD8,"A friend of mine mentioned watching Doc Martin so I started watching it on my Kindle, It is such a different show because it defies all rules of TV shows. The main character is a surgeon that develops a phobia about blood so he changes careers suddenly to become a general practitioner in a small but picturesque town. Unfortunately, he has no social skills so things do not go smoothly with the people in the town. He is respected as a doctor but everyone knows how difficult he is. His interactions with people are so funny because he is blunt and truthful. This is not always the easiest way to be. He falls in love with a local teacher but both realize they could never make each other happy. The teacher leaves town to teach in London but returns 6 months pregnant. After the baby is born they try so hard to make it work but dealing with a baby can be very difficult for anyone let alone the situation they find themselves in.

2388424,4,B000AE4QD8,"I just love the sense for reality that British TV has. In the US it seems TV characters have to be slender, wealthy, hip, and beautiful. But the Brits celebrate the average and the peculiar with great understanding and without apology. Kudos to them! Dr. Martin Ellingham (Doc Martin) emerges as the character that the viewer loves to hate (or at least, to misunderstand) as do most of the unique dwellers of the little town of Portwenn, where Martin has just arrived as the town's new general practitioner, transplanted from big-city London where he'd had a successful surgical practice until he spontaneously developed a phobia for the sight of blood (!). As the nutty stories develop, following the nutty but believable townspeople and their interaction with Doc Martin, we begin to give our ""hero"" better consideration, and the townspeople do as well; that is, except for the ubiquitous band of teenage girls in the town, who enjoy taunting Martin at every opportunity, and who function a bit like a Greek chorus in the series. ""Doc Martin"" is thoroughly enjoyable.......and did I mention the breathtakingly gorgeous setting that is this little town of Portwenn?",1371081600,,1166,5.046632124352332

2388437,5,B000AE4QD8,"Starts slow, thought watching lower key version of doctor House at first, but after a couple of episodes, i was hooked. how they develop characters is quite good.  seeing small town on the sea is always visually stimulating - must get alot of rain cause always green grass/fields.  Love play between Louisa and Doc Marting and the Aunt",1370304000,,335,4.758620689655173

2388441,5,B000AE4QD8,"This show is quirky, cute, and will suck you in. I am a bit of an anglophile and if you are too, you will love the town of Portwenn, the funny characters that occupy it, and the stories that follow these characters.

2388446,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc ""Martin"" says it like he sees it. unvarnished and with more compassion than he wants to admit. In fact, he is positively seething with the ""milk of human kindness"" but he wants no one to know it.

This community overstates what most communities in truth are.... the caricatures of the townspeople reveal tendencies from all communities... Doc has exactly what they need.  As a comedian, this guy really delivers the goods.",1369612800,,426,4.902777777777778
2388447,5,B000AE4QD8,"I was a little reluctant to watch this show because it looked like it would be the British version of House, which I don't like.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this show is.  Although Doc Martin is a bit of an unfriendly guy, the character has a lot more depth than that.  You do get a sense of why he is the way he is and that despite how he presents (with very few social skills), he does care about his patients and is capable of caring deeply.",1369612800,,470,4.142857142857143

2388451,5,B000AE4QD8,"Book report type synopses abound among these reviews, and my morning coffee is too enjoyable to revisit them.  But I want to offer praise for the dry wit so consistently offered by the screenwriter,  and the intelligent, sensitive portrayals that characterize each episode. After viewing eight episodes and counting,  I find it never gets stale, never predictable. The curious neighbors in Port Wenn have become my neighbors.  Deeply human, cheeky folks now live in my virtual neighborhood,  and they are welcome.",1369440000,,513,5.283950617283951
2388452,5,B000AE4QD8,"I love this series.  I visited a village in Scotland that reminds me of the village in this series, and I immerse myself in each episode.  So different from my daily life in Florida.  The stories are not sicky sweet, but they are gentle and funny and a glimpse into another culture.  There is sadness and some small drama,  and each episode meakes you ready for the next.",1369440000,,371,4.397058823529412

2388454,5,B000AE4QD8,The Doc Martin series is very entertaining. I get a great laugh watching the main character interact with the other supporting character in his seemingly clueless manner.

2388455,3,B000AE4QD8,"This show is not as intense as Downtown Abbey or London Hospital. It is a pleasant diversion from these shows. Doc Martin grows on you; he's not very likeable at first.
Great location shots. Solid stories and production.",1369094400,,220,4.815789473684211

2388457,5,B000AE4QD8,"After watching a few of these episodes, you wonder how this town survives.  It's so unbelievable, it's funny.  The characters grow on you.  Doc Martin is so odd you almost pity him.  Despite his lack of bedside manner, he truly cares about people and follows through on his patients' care.  Really worth watching!",1369008000,,313,4.830188679245283

2388459,5,B000AE4QD8,This is great humor -- low-key and droll as only the British can implement it. I enjoyed Doc Martin and the supporting characters and have since watched each episode in the series. I am looking forward to the 2013 shows.,1368921600,,220,4.525
2388460,5,B000AE4QD8,Thought the show was great.  Loved the interaction between the main characters. The actors really fit the part and can't wait for the next season.  Beautiful country side.,1368921600,,171,5.071428571428571

2388462,3,B000AE4QD8,"We watched all of season 1 and almost all of season 2.  The picture quality is not quite up to the standards I expected, seems a lot like it was filmed in 480P.  We are used to Hi Def filming.  The story line is interesting but does not seem to make any headway chronologically.  There are new stories and new characters introduced but nothing happens to the characters, in that they are here today and gone tomorrow.  We will continue to watch the show but not with the enthusiasm that we felt with Downton Abbey, now that is a great show.",1368921600,,540,4.306930693069307
2388463,5,B000AE4QD8,"We are enjoying watching this portrait of life - without the super-hyped drama of murders, car chases, and over-the-top drama designed to twist your stomach. So far the characters each have a wonderful combination of reality and quirkiness -- real personalities.

I also find the videography very well done - the color, composition, and quality all have great eye appeal for me.

We're eager to see if this great cast and creative tone survives a second season.",1368921600,,461,4.974025974025974
2388464,5,B000AE4QD8,"So entertaining even if Doc Martin has the worst bedside manner! Such a crass portrayal of an honest doctor who knows his craft, though there is room for his kind in this world of entitled beings. Really, Martin Clunes personifies that doctor in the truest sense of the word.",1368921600,,275,4.63265306122449
2388465,4,B000AE4QD8,Found Doc Martin on my local PBS channel and got hooked.  When Kindle had Season 1 via PRIME - I was thrilled.  Just wish there were more episodes.  Now there are more seasons available and I shall continue watching.,1368835200,,216,4.487179487179487

Now I can get it on my Kindle and am quite happily addicted to it. The characters are all quite interesting and provide enough variety to hold interest. I love that I can watch 5 seasons of the show for free with Kindle prime, but wonder how long it will be before Doc Martin ""jumps the shark"".",1368489600,,483,4.377777777777778

2388474,5,B000AE4QD8,It is a pleasure to watch Doc Martin. Beautiful settings. Talented actors. No explosions anywhere. Evolved characters instead. The Brits are the film makers to watch. At first your may not realize that the main character is set up for a laugh.  He is.  Successful and self defeating at the same time. Enjoy.,1368403200,,307,4.773584905660377
2388475,5,B000AE4QD8,"Excellent programs with a wonderful balance of the Doc's sweet and understandable (once you get to know him) asperity and his irascible, but lovable (again, once you get to know him) character.

2388479,5,B000AE4QD8,The doc is so quirky and rude but somehow I found myself loving him a lot.  He just needed someone kind to show him the way like Louisa.  They are a perfect match.  I was excited to just find out that they are actually shooting Season 6 now.  Can't wait to see it.,1368230400,,264,3.9245283018867925
2388480,5,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin is warm, funny, and left me looking forward to each new episode.  Here's this brilliant doctor who has absolutely no people skills - through no fault of his own.  He doesn't know that his frank and up front honesty can be insulting.  It is heartwarming to see him learn to open his heart to sensitivity, warmth, and love. A really great show.",1368230400,,353,4.484375

2388482,5,B000AE4QD8,"I enjoyed every minute of my visit to a small Cornish village via Saving Grace, and once again had the opportunity to experience the pretty scenery and charming, outrageous, bumptious, and altogether engaging citizens who live there.  The Doc's returns as the primary character in this series  He's so obnoxious, yet vulnerable and a good doctor.  We can't help but gain respect and fondness for the doctor as do the villagers.  We join him as he learns to care for them.  The villagers are played by a wonderful cast.
I hated to see the series end, and was happy to find and enjoy the Doc Martin movie.",1368144000,,603,4.598130841121495
2388483,5,B000AE4QD8,"At first, I was repulsed by his antisocial behavior, terrible bedside manner, coldness and homliness. I just didn't watch. But because my career was in medicine, I became more interested. Later, it became a challenge to guess from what malady his patients suffered. Then I found confirmation and even improvement in my diagnostic skills. Then I was drawn to the other villagers' lives. And, lastly, I developed an empathy for the good doctor and came to appreciate his own story and responses to the lives around him.",1368144000,,517,4.954022988505747

2388495,5,B000AE4QD8,Doc Martin is one of my favourite TV programs.  It is a breath of fresh air in an industry determined to shove sex and violence down our throats at every opportunity.  It portrays real people with their fine qualities and their warts. It never has unacceptable content.  It is often amusing without being stupid.,1367107200,,312,4.7407407407407405

I thoroughly enjoy the characters lives and problems they have in this small town. It's like getting back to basics in a modern world.

I can't ever quite leave him alone completely, though, and I always come back another day to watch just one more episode.

Doc Martin is a grouchy doctor with little patience with his patients but everyone comes to respect him for what he is, a great doctor.  Diamond in the rough.  He is a no nonsense person that just wants to heal people, no chit chat welcomed there although that doesn't stop the people from gossip and small talk.

This show itself is wonderful and if you are interested please read my review of it written under the box set purchase. This review is here just b/c I want people to know that it contained no subtitles which made it very difficult to follow. The British accents are very thick so if you think you may have trouble understanding them, get the dvd with subtitles. I recommend the box set also b/c the seasons are so wonderful you will want the set. Also note in this first season the character Elaine who serves as Doc Martin's secretary is annoying but she is only in this season so things get a lot better once that character is gone and she is gone after season one thankfully.",1363305600,5,804,4.4391891891891895

Quirky, dry, obtuse Doc Martin is not a riveting character who draws you in to his world, but the amusing supporting cast and laughable life situation this series depicts in a small English fishing village keep me coming back for more.

It has morphed a lot through the many years since it started, and each year is interesting for different reasons.  The story of Doc and Louisa now dominates the series, but I feel that the writers and actors have done such a good job, that people can relate to it in some way  or another.  Basically, after a while, you feel if these two characters can make a go of it, then there must be hope for the rest of us.  The trials and tribulations of their relationship, are very real to anyone who can relate to them.  If you follow closely, you might find something helpful or insightful to help in your own relationship... I know I did, for several of their situations, I could see (in some way) in my own life (even the doc's attitude). And so far, they do continue to work through their problems.

2388629,5,B000AE4QD8,"I have watched this series repeatedly because I find it to be so relaxing, funny, touching, and optimistic.  It is a joy to find the characters all have such interesting lives which one can relate to.  Martin Clunes is positively perfect in his roll as the village doctor. A former London surgeon, he developed an aversion to blood; hence, his return to the town of his childhood.  He appears to have some Asperger Disorder tendencies, and is certainly a man of few words.....often answering questions from his fellow villagers, who are also his patients, with one word.  Monosyabillic is his manner of speaking in many instances, which is considered by his fellow villagers as both rude, shocking, and endearing!  In our chaotic world in which live, we hear of  daily disasters, economic problems, healthcare problems, high crime rates, etc., I find the Doc Martin series takes me away to a quirky, charming, amusing, and far better land than the real world now has become.  Just watching the stories from the beautiful seaside village of Portwenn in Cornwall, England, serves as a far better and healthier tranquilizer than any pill.  Whenever I want to leave the problems of our world behind for awhile, I simply watch a few episodes of Doc Martin.",1361145600,,1251,4.895734597156398

Like any good story there has to be an ensemble of characters who are quirky and a village full of stories to tell.  This one is up there with All Creatures Great and Small but has us in a much more current time. The only fault I can find is that absolutely nobody would put up with the receptionist that Doc has to endure. She is rude, stubborn, and self obsessed but somehow the village thinks she deserves a job.  A good mixture of comedy, drama, and nail biting is what the perfect series needs and this has it all.

2388665,4,B000AE4QD8,"This medical drama about a surgeon who decamps to a small Cornish town as a lowly GP after he develops an aversion to blood is absorbing and entertaining. In fact, I am riveted to the screen if only because it's filmed in a town where my family once rented a house on vacation. My favorite crab shack is in almost every shot taken by the cove!

The characters are endearing and quirky (but not overly so, which can be annoying... although I'm glad Elaine is gone after the first season), even Doc Martin, who is actually abrasive and even unpleasant at times. But you come to understand him somewhat, and of course he saves the day on a regular basis.

My only complaint about the show is that some of the story lines are overly dependent on sexual themes. I dislike when TV writers distrust their audience with tamer matters. Everyday life is fascinating enough; there's no need to try to dress it up with salacious (and patently ridiculous) matters, in my opinion.

2388678,5,B000AE4QD8,"Barely two months after I first viewed the first episode, ""Doc Martin"" has now become one of my favorite productions ever, movie or television.  In fact, it's hard to think of a better production that I've seen in decades of television and movie viewing -- the outstanding comedy and drama of ""Doc Martin"" are that good.  Five stars are hardly enough for a program that produces this kind of enjoyment.

I've now watched all of the currently existing episodes through Series 5, and in my opinion, ""Doc Martin"" sustains its very high level of quality throughout, so I'd recommend the DVDs of all of the seasons.  I can hardly wait for Series 6, which star Martin Clunes has confirmed will be filmed in 2013 and will likely be the last series for the program.

For the uninitiated, the premise of the show is that the rather grouchy, socially inept but brilliant Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes) is taking over as a general practitioner in the picturesque seaside village of Portwenn in southwestern England, after leaving his London surgical practice when he develops a blood phobia.  Schoolteacher Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz) is one of the few villagers who appreciates Martin's good qualities -- she understands that his social rudeness disguises a man who actually cares for other people in a very literal way.  A romance results, creating a running thread through all of the seasons, although there are significant setbacks along the way.

Martin and Louisa are joined by plumber/restauranteur Bert Large (Ian McNeice) and his son/business partner Al (Joe Absolom); Martin's Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole), who runs a small, struggling family farm by herself; later on, Martin's Aunt Ruth (Dame Eileen Atkins), a psychiatrist; a series of quirky receptionists in the doctor's office, with Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) as the longest-serving and most memorable; the village pharmacist, Mrs. Tishell (Selina Cadell), who has a lasting crush on Martin; and two successive village police officers, Mark Mylow (Stewart Wright) and Joe Penhale (John Marquez), who share some well-meaning comic ineptitude with Mayberry's Barney Fife.

Both the acting and the writing on ""Doc Martin"" contain considerable depth.  My wife and I knew we were seeing something unusually good when, after each episode, we began discussing the characters' motivations, how their family backgrounds affected their personalities, and what those characters might have been doing while they were off-stage as a logical prelude to their on-stage actions.  Now, obviously, we know that these are fictional characters who don't really have family backgrounds and aren't really doing anything when they're not in a scene.  But the actors and the writers have created characters with so many dimensions that there is something very real about them -- it makes the viewer care about what they're going through now and wonder what's going to happen to them next.  To me, this is the ultimate success for a dramatic production: to create its own reality, one that the audience cares about.  All of the actors noted above and, of course, the writers have a great deal to be proud of here.

As you might guess, almost every program contains medical problems for Martin to deal with, ranging from routine but sometimes funny ailments to life-threatening emergencies -- that's the life of the only doctor in a small village.  But this isn't really a show about medicine, even though the main character is a medical doctor, it's a comedy/drama about a wide variety of people with a wide variety of things going on in their lives -- from Aunt Joan's financial problems on the farm to the Larges' business setbacks to the romantic yearnings of PC Mark Mylow.  But although the group of characters (and actors) here is outstanding, I wouldn't call this a true ensemble drama, because the series focuses on Martin, who is undoubtedly the main character -- this is his story, even though the other characters' stories are told as well.  As the show progresses, Louisa comes to share that focus because her relationship with Martin becomes so important to the show.  In this aspect, there's a certain similarity to ""Pride and Prejudice,"" I think, because both stories involve a romance, long in developing, between a very good-natured, sensible, and highly competent woman and a rather rude, haughty, but worthwhile man who needs someone to humanize him.  Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz constantly impress with the meaning they bring to these roles with their brilliantly subtle characterizations.  Small, almost unnoticed expressions often convey worlds of feeling.

(The Martin-Louisa romance has really caught the public imagination, apparently.  In an LA Times interview, Martin Clunes says that ""[a] boy came up and asked me for my autograph, followed by an old man who said, 'I don't want your autograph but just marry that girl before I die, willya?' That seems to sum up the level at which it hits people."")

But I'm not trying to downplay the other characters, and the excellent actors who portray them.  They're all a very important part of this show's considerable charm, and they all have their turns (sometimes numerous turns) as the center of different subplots in particular episodes.  These subplots can be either comic or dramatic for particular characters, rather than being only one or the other, again showing the depth of the writing and acting.  For example, Bert and Al Large, who are usually involved in rather funny situations, also deal with more serious family issues and business problems. PC Joe Penhale, a classic well-meaning bumbler, also has a sad encounter with his ex-wife.  And even when a character doesn't have his/her own plotline, that person very ably supports the characters who do.

While there's certainly a good deal of drama in these programs, the laughs shouldn't be overlooked.  The Larges, the police officers, the receptionists, and Mrs. Tishell all provide much humor -- as does Martin himself, whose disdainful reactions to the villagers are often very funny.

This story of an emotionally stunted man has the potential to create an abundance of emotion in its audience, because most viewers, I think, will care about these characters, laughing at their foibles and commiserating with their sorrows.  I give it my highest recommendation.  I would guess that most people who see just a few of the early episodes will, like me, want to see all of them, perhaps multiple times.",1346889600,,6482,5.09640831758034

2388684,3,B000AE4QD8,"I started watching this online and somewhat like it. I don't know why, but I think there are better British shows to check out. I would certainly never by this show on dvd. I like shows that are truly funny, like IT Crowd or Spaced. Even Kingdom was more likeable for me. Maybe it is because the main character seems like a jerk. When bad things happen to him, I guess we are supposed to find that funny, but my reaction is almost the same as his because who would be so daft as to think they wouln't have to answer the phone at their job? Why would a whole town turn their backs on a peson because he rightfully fired a person? IDK, thankfully there is a lot more out there and it is better than this show.

Sorry go see some people had horribel experiences ordering from other vendors through Amazon. I can understand how frustrating that must have been. But let's be frank, if you are buying a dvd filmed/shown/produce/etc in another country check to see if it will play in USA dvds or if a universal dvd player is needed.

All the villagers are a great counter-point to Doc Martin, and the story as it develops between he and Louisa is well done.  I appreciate that he keeps his attitude through the whole series, not becoming a new person to fit it, but rather making everyone adjust to him and his clinical, straight-forward ways.  As an aside, it's nice to find a quick witted, comedy series that I can watch with young kids running about the house and not worrying they're going to pick up some stray word here or there I don't want repeated, or have to turn it off if a sex scene pops up (very common in today's tv world).  I hope it continues and can't wait for season 5 to come up for watching.  And I heard they're doing a season 6 in 2013...yay!

It was great to see that the ""marker"" for Martin's relationship with Louisa was solidly established in this first episode. Martin's wierd interaction with people, especially Louisa, is misinterpreted negatively, and later Louisa becomes somewhat embarassed when she finds out what he really meant.

I guess that's a tribute to his acting skills.  He really is amazing.  His actions and reactions in Doc Martin are so subtle, while in Men Behaving Badly all of the characters are over the top.

2388703,1,B000AE4QD8,"Doc Martin was inflicted on me during a rainy week on vacation when the friend of a friend had the box set and insisted everyone watch several series. With the exception of this complete imbecile, we (British and Americans) absolutely hated the show. Has he BBC really become so desperate for a hit?

Specifically we found that it completely lacked any real character development most especially in the leading role (Doctor Martin). It truly represents British drama or comedy drama at it's very worst with dreadful writing, directing and acting. The characters are all simple one dimensional pastiches of country types as envisaged by the smug London-centric writer/creators of the show - deeply insulting to people whom live outside the sophisticated confines of the ""Home Counties"". Every single story line is so obvious and manipulative that it insults the intelligence. A good metaphor for the utter shallowness and complete lack of attempt at any basis in reality is the permanent state of sunny blue sky weather in the coastal village in the south west of England where one is lucky to get 2 month's worth of such beautiful days in a year - speaking from bitter experience. Those who love the show are apparently content with such utter banality. A common groan rose every time a shot of Doc Martin's big silver Lexus (an unusual car in the the UK) tearing across the moors appeared with musical accompaniment - what was the director thinking?! It simply looked like a bad car commercial - a good one has more drama and technical competence than the entire series.

The acting is almost offensively bad with Martin Clunes - not exactly renowned for any role other than his brilliant comedic depiction of boyish oafishness in ""Men Behaving Badly"", is truly awful. Although playing a doctor devoid of human empathy, his inability to express this other than using crass remarks and a total lack of emotion is bottom of the barrel stuff. Almost no attempt is made to go beyond this and indeed one quickly realizes that both actor and writers are incapable of doing so. As mentioned above, the supporting cast are demoted to simplistic characterizations of country bumpkins with exaggerated accents, eccentricities and simplistic ways. A few of the actors who complained about this during series 1 didn't make it to series 2... The critics in the UK hated the show and after watching it myself I can clearly see why they loathed this utterly dreadful crap lacking in any real comedy or drama.

In contrast one one can hold up various UK and US shows past and present that contain various similar elements of cantankerous doctor or vet and/or fish out of water scenario. ""House"" of course reigns supreme with both viewers and critics as did ""All Creatures Great and Small"" back in the day. Simon Cowell on American Idol and various British variants, the grouches on Scrubs and ER are all good characters that were well executed by good performers and evolved over time. Doc Martin has absolutely nothing on such shows.

No stars if possible - save your time and money with a sow that actually stimulates and genuinely entertains beyond the lowest common denominator.

DREADFUL!!",1316822400,12,3179,4.912476722532588
2388704,2,B000AE4QD8,"I read the reviews and had high hopes for this series. I imagined a big city doctor moving to a quiet village full of quirky and loveable characters. Well, the characters were quirky but few were loveable.

Doc Martin is a cranky and unpleasant doctor surrounded but cranky and unpleasant villagers. It should be a perfect match but neither the doctor nor the villagers are accepting of each other. It seems like the only two in town who like Doc Martin are his elderly aunt and a homeless dog that follows him around despite his best efforts to rid himself of the animal.

A sudden aversion to blood ruined his highly successful career as a surgeon. The lovely village of Portwenn need a new GP (General Practioner). Doc Martin had spent a few summers in the village with his aunt and that seems to be his reason for applying for the position. It's never clear why the village and the townsfolk seem alien to him even though he had been to Portwenn in his youth.

Enter his inept receptionist Elaine--the epitomy of a quirky character. She'd rather talk on the phone than work and she seems dangerously unqualified to work in a medical office. She apparently comes with the office and despite an attempt to fire her, Doc Martin is stuck with Elaine..just as the townspeople expect.

It's a slow beginning and finally he has some patients but none have any medical issues. His office becomes a social gathering place for tea and biscuits (cookies). Yet, Doc Martin does have the knack for diagnosing serious conditions in non-patients that he meets in his everyday life. He can see medical conditions before the people realize there is a problem. This is an interesting side of Doc Martin's character that could really be used to liven up the bland storylines.

There is a one saving grace of this series and it is a BIG saving grace. The village and the surrounding area are truly beautiful. It's a joy just to see the village and the typical British buildings and the lovely countryside. The scenery alone makes it worth the view.

I tried to give the series a chance. I watched 4 episodes and the show seems to be a constant repitition of the villagers showing their disdain of Doc Martin and the doctor returning the mistrust.

Lots of reviewers love the series and I wish I could be one of them. I just couldn't get over the bland storylines and the fact that so few characters were likeable.

It has the best casting, the best acting, and the best story line of any television series I have ever seen. The series is filmed, in the summertime, in the real village of Port Isaac, in Cornwall, England. They have renamed the town Port Wenn, and this locale is a top contributor to the lovability of this series.

This series is about two people in search of love and happiness: Doctor Martin Ellingham, an arrogant chief surgeon from London, and a local elementary school teacher Louisa Glasson, who will soon be a middle aged old maid school teacher. They both have never found success in ""love."" Martin, forced to leave his powerful position as chief of vascular surgery in London because of a sudden onset of panic attacks at the sight of blood, applies for the position as GP in Port Wenn, a village near his fraternal aunt's farm, where he spent summers as a child. He meets Louisa on his flight to Cornwall, to be interviewed by the committee that will hire him. Lousia is the ""lay"" representative from Port Wenn. Their meeting gets off to a bad start for both, but they both come away from that initial meeting puzzled and not understanding their feelings for each other.  As the series progresses, their interaction stirs emotions and sexual tension. Martin Clunes stars as Doc Martin, and Carolyn Catz stars as Louisa Glasson.

Running side by side with the ""love story"" is Doc Martin's trials and tribulations with the locals and their quirky problems and ways.  More than any series I've ever watched, the top quality filming of these episodes leaves you with a feeling that you are an invisible observer wandering about the village observing its life, and chiefly the day's activities of Martin Ellingham. I sincerely hope they continue this series, as has been rumored. P.S. And you can understand every word spoken by the cast, in contrast to much of television in the UK. (Try understanding the long running series ""All Creatures Great and Small""; the books were great, the TV show was obviously for local Brits, only.)",1311206400,45,2119,4.781420765027322

2388718,3,B000AE4QD8,"(I'm willing to bet all the 5star ratings this show gets are due to it's British Accent.  Some people...)

""Doc Martin"" often gets compared (usually unfavorably) with ""Northern Exposure"", so let's start by saying it is NOT the British version of that show.  It was inspired by the movie ""Saving Grace"" about a once wealthy widow who turns to growing pot, and which was also filmed in Port Issac, on the Cornish coast.  However, it doesn't even pick up where that movie left off, either.  ""Doc Martin"" is about a big city doctor with personality issues who takes up practice in a small town, it sounds like ""Northern Exposure"" but it lacks the ensemble cast format, so it always follows the Doc when the show would benefit by focusing every now and then on other characters and their relationships.  It also fails to make anything more than a backdrop out of the gorgeous Cornwall coast, which is a shame.  The producers seem to want to make it into the California coast and always shoot in sunshine, when clearly, this town is not a warm, sunny, Santa Barbara type of town.  I would have enjoyed more good old English weather, rain and all that.

Still, once you sit on your ""Northern Exposure"" expectations and smother them, this show entertains.  The doc never fails to leave you exasperated with his sheer rudeness, while at the same time you cheer when he tells some dolt to ""Shut up!"" or ""Get OUT!"".  I watched the series disc by disc, season one through four, and enjoyed all of it, and I look forward to season 5.  Having said that, I would recommend it as I viewed it:  As a rental.  It's good, but not so good you'll want to have it on hand, right now, when you think you'd like to watch an episode or two.  I love the British accent as much as anybody, but I've heard enough of them to know not to be swayed into thinking the mere sound of the Kings English makes anything seem sophisticated and top notch.

Yet one can get through an entire episode of Doc Martin versus House.

This series is a new favorite at our house adding it to the line up of Vicar of Dibley, Kingdom, Spaced, Downton Abbey, Doctor Who, and the many other great shows we invest our time in viewing.",1297900800,,556,4.186915887850467
2388733,5,B000AE4QD8,"We're fans of British drama but had not heard of Doc Martin so we decided to give it a try. Now we're glad we did as this series reveals a truly non-typical hero, Doctor Martin Ellingham.

Our first reaction to Doc was how unlikely his appearance was for a leading man, after we adjusted to his appearance we were somewhat put off by his rude, self-centered behavior. It didn't take long, however, for us to get completely interested in this very strange, but dedicated individual.

Circumstances, which I will not reveal, results in this well established and competent surgeon relocating from London to the small fishing village of Portwenn in Cornwall. The initial shows in this series address the rather difficult process the Doc and the people of the village have in trying to adjust to each other. A teacher in Portwenn, Louisa Glasson, played by Caroline Catz, provides the occasional romantic interest for Doc; Catz is very touching as Louisa.

Whereas this may sound rather mundane, let me assure you it is anything but that; after watching the first episode we were completely hooked on the Doc and his life in Portwenn. Martin Clunes is outstanding as the irascible Doc and actually begins to generate some sympathy for him and his situation. I commented to my wife that the Doc character is very interesting to watch but I certainly wouldn't care to know him personally.

One of the benefits of this series is the beautiful scenery around Port Isaac where the series is filmed. For instance, the Doc's house in the series can be seen in Port Isaac. Although the location is a tourist destination, the filming of Doc Martin has helped put Port Isaac on the map.

We are now watching the second half of series 4 and look forward to seeing all of the remaining shows. If you enjoy British actors and acting you will enjoy this series. It was a real wake-up call to find something as good as this series and realize that it was only by chance that we found it.

I was interested to note the longevity of the actors; it appears all of the leading roles have been played by the same actors since the shows inception in 2004.

I have read that a 5th series is scheduled to be filmed in 2011; this gives us fans something to look forward to! The 5th series is scheduled to run 8 episodes.

This is a very distinctive series; it may be so distinctive as to polarize some viewers but we have solidly come down on the side of fans of the series. I recommend you check it out and see what you think.",1296086400,,2498,4.535555555555556

Doc Martin is a doctor who says what he thinks and yells at patients who do not take care of themselves or follow his instructions.  It is hilarious!  He has come to Portman on the Cornish coast because he has a special problem that makes it impossible to continue as a surgeon in a London hospital.  He has a phobia towards blood.  It makes it hard to deal with patients because he gets sick whenever he sees blood and he is always trying to hide his problem.  He meets Louisa, the town schoolteacher, and falls for her but they don't seem to get along most of the time until later when they get cozy and she becomes pregnant.  He has a hard time showing his feelings to Louisa. She leaves town after their marriage plans gets cancelled.  Then she returns and he has to watch her pregnancy without being involved in her life and it makes him crazy but he's too proud to tell her how he feels.  The last episode is a stitch because the baby is coming and he is there but can't seem to be of any help.  It's the best part of the whole series.

2388750,5,B000AE4QD8,"My husband and I - as well as our closest friends - have become dedicated to BBC series for their quality and subtle story/character developments. Conversations between characters tend to be verbal and non-verbal, with inflection and innuendos not commonly seen in US television.
Together with our friends - we've created ""libraries"" of these series on DVD sharing them back and forth - and turn to these when ""scheduled"" television offers nothing on a given night...

That said - Doc Martin is one of the very best of these series. Combining drama and humor - it at times seems to faintly reinvent the BBC classic -  ""All Creatures Great and Small"" - although with the 'patients'(including the doctor himself) being HUMAN this time round. At other times - you might be reminded of Northern Exposure at its best - but with more focus and with the ongoing interest of the medical challenge facing the doctor in each episode.

 The characters all have depth and foibles -  and over time you come to see that the community of Portwen (where the series is set)  is a reflection of real towns - and friends - and families - anywhere.  This is suggested early in the series - when the inevitable clash between the ""arrogant"" Doc Martin - and the ""unsophisticated"" villagers comes to a head - one villager steps in as mediator and points out the obvious - despite all their differences - the villagers - including their new doctor - need one another.  They are in fact - the sum of their parts. And then you get it.  The series is not one-dimensional - the plots of each episode generally turn not on one story - with key players and a back up cast - but rather on the development of circumstances - which likely involves multiple characters and their personalities.  For this reason the show somehow remains fresh - season after season - episode after episode.

Highly recommended for anyone over 14 (there are some adult situations and medical situations in some of the shows that in my opinion are not appropriate for younger children)",1282435200,5,2031,4.692957746478873

2388752,5,B000AE4QD8,"That pretty much sums up ""Doc Martin.""

1.  It's one part Northern Exposure in that it puts a city doctor in the middle of a beautiful country setting and has him have a slow-motion romance with a comely local.

2.  It's one part ""Local Hero"" because the good citizens of the Cornish village that the story is set in are pretty much the equivalent of the equally zany Scottish ones in that movie.

3.  It's one part ""House"" because the center of the show is a gruff but brilliant surgeon who has a disability that makes life for him very hard sometimes.

Actually, ""gruff"" is an understatement.  Doc Martin is arrogant, humorless, impatient, and does not REPEAT does not suffer fools easily.  But with this being said, you get the impression that underneath that very hard shell is someone who is fundamentally decent and who looks on at the previously mentioned comely local, schoolteacher Louisa with longing in his heart.

The show is not perfect.  Doc Martin and Louisa go from being barely speaking to each other to being on the verge of marriage with very little in the way of any tender moments shown between them.  I also wonder when we'll get to see Doc Martin laugh or smile.  But I suppose there's time for all of that and unlike ""Northern Exposure"" where the entire long-form comedy storyline got derailed when Rob Morrow left the show, I hope they wind up Doc Martin with the happy ending we're all rooting for.",1279497600,4,1424,4.603174603174603

He ends up taking a job as a local GP in a small town in Cornwall where he has an aunt living nearby. Things are a bit ""informal"" there, and it does not go too well at first, but he finally settles in. The Doc is a bit arrogant, but he is a good doctor and does care.

2388754,5,B000AE4QD8,"If anyone has read my reviews on this board, it is obvious that I am a great fan of British television programs; however, being in kind of a rut, I decided to try something new to me--the ""Doc Martin"" series.  I am so delighted; it is just what my life needed.

The ""Doc Martin"" comedy series is a funny delight.  Doc Martin is a wonderful character. Martin was a successful surgeon in the ""big city"" of London.  After developing a dislike for blood, he becomes a General Practitioner and the only doctor in a small picturesque seaside town that is filled with rather odd and eccentric people that includes a plumber and his son that just don't seem able to repair any faulty plumbing with disastrous results; his rather surly receptionist that is very incompetent that she and the townsfolk won't ""let"" him dismiss plus a host of very interesting patents for him to treat that have all kinds of ailments from men growing breasts to the extreme bowel problems to a man that has an imaginary six foot grey squirrel as his best friends that he needs meds for.

Doc Martin has NO ""bed side"" manners and tends to speak what he is thinking even if it's not too nice.  Nevertheless, he is very intuitive solving medical mysteries that are plaguing the little town.

This series is extremely well written and is filled with loads of rather ""black"" humor that the British can do so well.  It is also very well directed.  I love it and intend to purchase more of the series",1278633600,4,1464,4.515151515151516

when the product I ordered on 5/7/10 had not arrived by 5/28/10, I contacted Amazon, and they concluded that the item had been lost in shipping and sent me a replacement dvd which arrived promptly, BUT there was a fair amount of 'skipping' on the second disc.  Two days later, the original order (placed on 5/7) arrived.  It is still in its wrapper, and eventually I will view it to see if it is in good shape, or if it skips too.

So.... the Doc Martin series gets 5 stars; the very late delivery of the 5/7/10 product gets zero stars; and the prompt replacement of the 'lost in shipping' dvd gets five stars; but the quality of the replacement dvd gets 3 stars.",1277769600,,755,4.295774647887324

If you are looking for witty, well- written and well-acted series, then pick up all of them. You will not be disappointed!
The best part of this show is that you can sit down and watch Doc Martin all day all and not get bored.
More importantly if you are looking for some brownie points with you wife, buy this series. The love story written in here is wonderful. Your wife will love you for it.
Just watch out for Anthony, ever since he left the ranger's place, he might just show up at your house!

 Doc Martin (Martin Clunes) is an arrogant,  socially inept, short-tempered, dog-hating,  big-time, big-city surgeon who takes over the practice of  a small-town GP after developing a sudden and  unfortunate aversion to the sight and smell of blood.

  On the one hand you kind of feel sorry for him, on the other hand it's not all that easy to like him.

He interacts with the  usual coterie of small town characters--the pretty young teacher who hates him at first sight (and we all know where that's going don't we?), the incompetent,  attitude-challenged secretary that the town won't let him fire (Lucy Punch, one of the wicked stepsisters in ""Enchanted""), the incompetent plumber  (Ian McNeice--could the Brits make a series without him?), and as Doc's beloved aunt, Stephanie Cole (Diana on ""Waiting for God""). John Alderton, Ben Miller, Celia Imrie and  other familiar faces make guest appearances. The series writer is Dominic Minghella (brother of  Anthony) The waterfront town is lovely.

Not great dramedy,  but good enough to keep me watching till the end.  If you like Clunes in this,  you're likely to  like him even more in ""Goodbye Mr. Chips.""",1269043200,22,1171,5.036649214659686
2388760,5,B000AE4QD8,"If you've seen 'Saving Grace', you are sure to love this series. Why? Because the very character of Doc Martin was originally based off of Clunes' character of Martin Bamford. A revision or two later & the series 'Doc Martin' was born! And boy, do I love it!

The series follows Clunes' character of Martin Ellingham, a doctor who was previously a successful surgeon until he developed a nasty aversion to blood. Hoping to find some peace of mind, he decides to become a GP (general practitioner) in the town he used to vacation in as a child- Portwenn. Unfortunately the good doctor seems to have a humongous problem dealing with people... and his bedside manner leaves much to desire. Whether it's dealing with a highly inefficient secretary that's loved by the entire town or making snap diagnoses about health problems, Doc Martin is sure to please!

The series is wonderful. This disc set however, does leave something to be desired. Unfortunately the set is beyond being even the barest bones. There's only the episodes on here, with no special features at all. No subtitles & no close captioning will make this set unfortunately inaccessible to many viewers out there. (My set has close captioning turned on & nothing showed up.) So if you are hard of hearing or are unable to hear regular television noises, this will unfortunately be something you may want to pass on.

But oh man... the series is wonderful. I couldn't help but giggle throughout the funny parts & commiserate with the characters during the more sad parts. Seriously folks- this is as good as it gets.",1263081600,12,1577,4.790441176470588

Martin Clunes is superb as the blood phobic London surgeon who relocates to a rural General Practice role . His lack of a bedside manner is in stark contrast to his previous work in the William and Mary series where he played a sensitive undertaker courting a busy midwife. You can explore his work on PBS and Netflix. I gave this DVD as a gift to my adult daughter and her family as they don't watch TV much but greatly enjoy a good human story. The topics dealt with in both series can be very adult but are handled with humor and can be used as teaching and talking points with children, especially teens, if you are the kind of parent who teaches kids to cope with problems rather than keep them ""protected"" from real life.

The Amazon description didn't have any comments about CC (which should have warned me - I could have avoided the disappointment).  So I now have physical possession of the series with a slightly better picture (and noticeably better sound) than streaming - along with the improved ""run control"" of a disc player.

We were very lucky that series 4 was being filmed whilst we were there and we got to meet some of the stars. The village is exactly as it appears in the series, small and sleepy with narrow winding roads. Life doesn't seem to have changed a great deal for the residents and the ones we met could have been out of the show.

We were sat in a pub overlooking the harbour where the cars are parked on the sand and whilst we watched 2 of the cars began to be covered by the tide. No one seemed to panic and when the drivers were eventually found they waded out to the cars and drove them ashore, locked them up and went back to work. It is so typical of the way it is shown on screen.

Here he plays a more serious character with a sufficient number of foibles to add comic dimensions to his actions.  He plays an eminent surgeon who has suddenly developed an aversion to the sight of blood and redefined himself as a G.P. in a small, seaside village in Cornwall.  This is a succession of fish out of water tales, with the amusement coming in equal measure from the doctor himself and the quirky locals.  The doctor is well-meaning but occasionally feckless, dead-panned in his honesty and laconic in his speech (when, e.g., he is being interviewed by the local talk show host).  This is the sort of thing that the British do expertly.  The individual episodes are relatively brief, so that you can watch several in an evening or shoehorn one in when you don't have the time or inclination for a full-length feature.  The Cornish setting and ocean views are a significant bonus and the stories are sweet, clever and suitably clinical.  Highly recommended.",1238198400,4,1033,4.862857142857143

There is no direct comparison to US tv in my mind-it's just too real.  Possibly a hint of Northern Exposure, ER, Seinfeld, and Frasier? And Archie Bunker springs to mind, but I'm not sure how.

2388787,5,B000AE4QD8,"I absolutely LOVED this series. I had heard Martin compared with House, and I think that's a bit unfair, albeit understandable. However, I prefer to think of him as a strange cross between House and James Harriot. Although James was just nice, nice, nice (ad nauseum), the situations in which they find themselves are really very similar - close-knit countryside full of bizarre natives with bizarre rituals. In personality he is much more like House, with one huge difference: House is a rude, insensitive jerk simply because he enjoys it, while Martin, not a jerk at all, frequently acts like one because he doesn't seem to know any better. Like House, Martin's dry, deadpan comebacks are hilarious.

Each episode of Season 1 is better than the one before, culminating in an ending so funny I think I had tears in my eyes. He just never learns, does he?

I still can't quite put my finger on what makes Martin so charming, since I'm not sure I would enjoy knowing him in person. Probably (and due in large part to the brilliant Martin Clunes) it is because he is so very real, and you can't help but identify with his out-of-place, misunderstood persona. Haven't we all been there?

Also, anyone who has first-hand knowledge of surgeons (any speciality) can readily feel right at home with asocial Doc Martin. His plain spoken, unvarnished truth is painful to listen to; but don't we all wish we could tell it like it is, maybe the person will improve their behavior or in medicine - live instead of die?

Doc Martin's first and seemingly only interest in life is practicing  medicine. It is the only way he can show his love of humanity.

Unfortunately in this 1st series, his love for anything does not apply to an all-loving dog (GOD, spelled backward)who is the only living creature  willing to love the cold doctor. His harsh, unloving treatment of the animal is difficult for dog lover's to watch. Martin's inability to accept love or kindness by anyone or anything is startling, but does exist in life.

The supporting actors are gifted in their ability to portray strong eccentric personalities. They give not an inch to the rude doctor. We not so silently praise them for socking it to him.

While Doc surprises us with his unilateral personality, we develop a strong affection for him as he is forced to suffer and evolve.
