8661075,5,B00KRW4T1M,"All good and i have no idea about the issues some reviewers have had about the DVD Zones. I spent the $30 on a No Zone DVD player, so it played with no problems.",1463011200,,161,3.764705882352941
8661076,1,B00KRW4T1M,Make sure you have an all region DVD player as this is a PAL region 0 and not NTSC. I got screwed because no where does it state this and you wouldn't know unless you blew up the picture of the back cover.,1458345600,,205,3.7906976744186047
8661077,5,B00KRW4T1M,"Though short, this is a classic Midnight Oil concert - high energy and great performances (ok, the barely rehearsed ""Instant Karma"" is more attitude than precision, but it works in the guerrilla theater context). Songs performed live are : ""Dreamworld"", ""Blue Sky Mine"", ""Instant Karma"", ""River Runs Red"", ""Progress"", and ""Sometimes""; the DVD is fleshed out by interviews around and about the event, as well as the music video for ""King Of The Mountain"". Highly recommended for all Oils fans

BUT...

Unlike what is stated in the info for the DVD, this is not Region 2, but Region 0, which means it will play anywhere. If you look closely at the picture of the back cover you can see it even says Region: All. HOWEVER the format is PAL, not the NTSC used in the US. Many DVD players are able to convert and play PAL to NTSC on the fly; but not all. So you have to check your DVD player specs; but if it can play PAL, you should be good to go.

One last caveat: I bought from one of the ""Buying Choices"" sellers, ""deep_discount_dvd_cd"". Because of the pictures shown, I assume that all versions being offered here are Region All. But since Amazon states the ones they are selling directly as Region 2, despite the picture showing Region All...well, proceed as you see best.",1429315200,2,1272,4.5701754385964914

8661080,5,B00KRW4T1M,"This is one of the best live films of Midnight Oil that I've ever come across.  It is also the band at their peak of popularity in the U.S.  Best version of Progress ever recorded and watching this live on a flatbed truck in Manhattan without any ""special effects"" displays the raw talent of this band.  I consider Midnight Oil the best live band I've ever seen and wish this were available in Region 1 since I no longer have a player for my antique VHS tape.  Worth every penny.

This film was made after Blue Sky Mining came out so there is a lot from this album as well as the previously released Diesel and Dust.",1412208000,,616,4.230769230769231
8661081,5,B00KRW4T1M,"I'd like to be brief:  if you wish to know what Midnight Oil has stood for, watch this.  It's a wonderful live set, taking place symbolically in front of the Exxon building in NY.  ""I love it when the suits clap""~~

To live, you must be willing to risk.  ""Don't give in...""",1003536000,7,295,4.3090909090909095
