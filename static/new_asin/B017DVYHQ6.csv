The MP3 albums for Brother Francis are available for Prime. My three year old especially jams to these songs but my five and eight year old also deeply enjoy it.
""In the name of the father and the son and Holy Spirit"" single handedly taught my kids how to cross themselves.
I spaced out buying the Brother Francis DVDs to one to two a month. I wish the DVDs were on Amazon Prime but as of now I still don't see them.",1497657600,,528,4.29

8738804,4,B017DVYHQ6,"JoyToons is the most recent Brother Francis DVD and a strictly musical ""episode."" The DVD begins with Brother Francis singing ""The Bread of Life,"" and leads into him talking about the importance of music, a quote from St. Augustine, and different reasons we sing. He also makes reference to how much music is in the Bible, including the Psalms; Paul singing in prison; and music in the book of Revelation. The rest of the episode is composed of a dozen songs, previously featured in the first nine episodes of the Brother Francis series. Before each song is a quote from a saint, like St. Josemaria Escriva or St. John Vianney, that relates to the song. Unfortunately, this was my least favorite Brother Francis DVD, and I feel it would have been better just to be a CD. What could have improved this episode is having the words of each song at the bottom of the screen so kids could see and hear the words at the same time to reinforce memory. The DVD does have some merit though, as it could be used for very young children to fill time and reinforce the faith without stories.",1453852800,2,1079,4.510204081632653
