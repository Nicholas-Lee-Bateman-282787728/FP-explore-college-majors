8444611,4,B004W7D1NA,"I have learned 3 quick licks DVDs in their entirety by Danny Gill. These are great if you want to learn the techniques of certain styles. Don't expect to play like Hendrix, this is in the 'style' of Hendrix. Who learns a real Hendrix song and actually sounds like him anyway? Danny breaks down the techniques and some of the phrasing that Hendrix used and presents it in I think 4 solos you can learn individually. I love these dvd's much more than actually copying the artists songs. For the main reason that you get note by note explanation of what is being played, visually learning the mechanics, and also you learn better how these techniques apply to music rather than just regurgitating tablature. I bought a blank tab book and followed along with the DVD an wrote out the tabs myself. You commit the notation to memory much better that way. I highly recommend theses dvd's. I have improved as a guitar player more in the last year using these than I did in 17 years reading tabs for songs. Seriously. They also provide great original playing material for when you go into a guitar shop and test out some guitars. Instead of playing some tired Metallica Riffs, or sweet child o mine intro or whatever like everyone else, you are playing great, original licks and solos that I almost guarantee no one else is playing in there. You can play the solos individually or play them all back to back as one big solo, or take parts of each solo and customize a solo. It's all up to you to learn them well and have fun doing it. You'll impress people at the shop.",1474329600,,1560,4.458041958041958
