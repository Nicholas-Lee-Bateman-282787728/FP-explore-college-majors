Why said Watson? Its elementary, my dear Watson. The Grand Jury did not indict him, so its no surprise that the Petit Jury did not convict him. But the media kept saying the verdict would be guilty said Watson. But you know how the newspapers reported the cases we were involved in said Holmes. If you look at the time element and the condition of the accused there is no possibility of guilt said Holmes. Im sorry Holmes, but I don't understand replied Watson.

Holmes explained the limo driver took the accused to the LA airport at 11 PM so he could not have killed two people afterwards. The limo driver arrived at 10:22 PM and waited until the scheduled 10:45 PM pickup time. He did not see or hear any SUV arrive during this time. That waiter checked out from work at 10 PM then walked to his home, changed out of his clothing, then walked a few blocks to get that car. If the murders occurred at 10:30 PM or so the blood would be black and clotted. You remember my monograph on this subject? So who could have done it asked Watson. It was most likely someone who was an enemy of that waiter said Holmes. The noise of the fight drew Nicole out of the safety of her house and she became a witness to the murder. So she had to be killed as well to eliminate an eyewitness.

Why would anyone want to kill the waiter asked Watson? If we knew the motive we would be able to find the killers said Holmes. Holmes wondered if the waiter stopped somewhere and was followed. We know little about his history said Holmes. Some say the method used to kill Nicole has been used by drug dealers against non-paying customers. I have no experience there said Holmes. The LAPD police should not have halted their investigation so soon said Holmes. After the crime the experienced criminal defense lawyer had his client examined by a doctor and photographed nude from head to toe. There were no bruises or cuts and slashes anywhere on his body, except for a cut on one finger. This cut was not seen by Kato or the limo driver, the ticket agent or the other passengers on the airliner. The hands of the waiter showed bruises from punching somebody hard, he was trained in the martial arts. The blood evidence had EDTA which showed it came from the blood sample, and was planted evidence.

Did you note the curious incident with the publicity about Nicoles boyfriend? asked Holmes. There was no publicity about Nicoles boyfriend said Watson. That was the curious incident replied Holmes.

I guess this will become an addition to that Famous Unsolved Mysteries book said Watson. What do you think? Holmes reminded him of The Case of the Long-Legged Models. A woman inherited shares in a Las Vegas Casino after her father was murdered. It was never solved. Murders by organized crime are seldom solved by the police unless they blame an innocent man said her famous lawyer. He had covered the murder trial of Sir Harry Oakes for the Hearst Press. What are the chance of learning a solution asked Watson? Holmes replied you mean learning the correct solution. Many have invented solutions that are contradicted by the known facts, only those who know little about this case believe them.

What do YOU really know about this case?  :-)",1454457600,,3384,4.539344262295082
