2163394,5,B00062WUVY,I first saw this movie on T.V. at Christmas time and having been looking for it to add to my Christmas movies.  It will become a ritual to watch this with all my other Christmas favorites.  It's a touching story and Melissa Gilbert is great!,1168300800,17,241,4.333333333333333
2163395,5,B00062WUVY,"A very cute, wonderful movie.  If you're a Travis Tritt fan, you'll love him in this and love his character.  He proves to be a very good actor who seems to have personally experienced some of the story in his own life (some of the facial expressions and timing seem to come from his personal experience, not from acting!)  I'm always looking for good Christmas movies, and this one was new to me.  Also gave me more insight into Travis' ""Where Corn Don't Grow"" and I discovered just how talented this man is - and underappreciated!  A great find.",1107475200,44,547,4.484848484848484

2163436,4,B00062WUVY,"Melissa Gilbert Plays Emma, widowed single mother who works at Beane Tractor Corporation""s assembly plant in a small Nebraska town. Tim Matheson, plays Jake Peterson, an executive at the head office who has been given the assignment to see who should be fired in the company's massive downsizing due to poor sales.  Jake pretends to be a buyer in order to get to know the plant and the townspeople.  He is warmly welcomed and made to feel at home.  He also begins to develop feelings for Emma, and she for him as well. When the truth comes out, they give him a cold shoulder, a cold that would rival the arctic. Emma pints out a solution that Jake can use to save the jobs and still look good at headquarters-make smaller tractors that everyday people can afford.  Emma's daughter attempts to direct a Senior Citizen choir and the mystery of why some body would go around the town stealing angels just add to the enjoyment of the film.",1422835200,2,935,4.5476190476190474

2163452,5,B00062WUVY,"I was not really a Little House on the Prairie fan, and this may be my favorite performance of both Mellisa Gilbert and Tim Matheson.  It is a nicely done little romantic movie framed around a struggling tractor factory.  That's an unusual setting and is combined with a surprisingly good performance by a country singer, Travis Tritt.  I think Frank Capra might have claimed this one.",1417651200,2,385,4.803030303030303
2163453,5,B00062WUVY,"I have been watching this a few times each holiday season since 2005. Love the chemistry between Melissa and Tom, and the way things tie together at the end. I love the way the people in the town and at Beans stick together; it is the kind of place you want to live in.
This type of movie can be viewed by the family; there is no violence or anything risque. It gives me a homey, feel good feeling, even with a simple meal like the meatloaf Melissa serves.",1417651200,2,456,4.134831460674158

2163461,2,B00062WUVY,"This movie was sappy, predictable, and unbelievable. Did anyone think the young businessman was going to fire half the workers? Did anyone think that the manager and workers wouldnt do something innovative to make the tractor factory profitable? Did anyone think that Mr. Businessman and Ms. Runthefarmwoman wouldn't fall in love? But, as others have noted, thats the unbelievable part. It took about two minutes of being together for them to become smitten. I can believe that between sixteen-year-olds, but not thirty-something-year-olds.

My favorite part was the girl Noelle Murphy. Michelle Trachtenberg made Noelle the most believable character in the movie. Thats what bumped the movie to two stars.",1408406400,,706,5.477064220183486
2163462,4,B00062WUVY,"It is great to watch a Christmas movie that doesn't creep you out or make Santa Claus a monster or a killer. Sure it is super sweet and maybe some people don't like that, but they can turn it off. But the TV should show more family friendly movies especially at Christmas and thanksgiving.",1408060800,,289,4.37037037037037

My hubby strongly dislikes hokey silly Christmas movies especially ones about Santa Claus. This movie is neither of these things.  It's about family and friends with a down-home country feel to it. Yes, the movie is predictable but my hubby sat and watched the entire movie without complaining.  I wouldn't consider it a classic for everyone (like children) but I make it a point to watch it every year.  I give it 4 stars for the choice in actors and the feel-good romantic story.  By the way, this movie was originally called ""Christmas in My Hometown"".",1359244800,,644,4.705357142857143

2163522,5,B00062WUVY,"This move was originally called "" Christmas in My Hometown"" and for some stupid reason they changed the name.
I hate when they do that, and don't understand why they do it!!!
I searched for this for a long time under it's original name...
 The theme song Is ""Christmas in My Hometown"" and it is about a man ( Tim Matheson) who returns to his hometown that he left as a child. He is sent there by his company, Beane Tractor Corp., incognito; who is planning to downsize.
And about a widowed mother (Melissa Gilbert) who, like most of the town, works for Beane's building tractors and can't afford to lose her job. Tim Matheson must decide who stays and who goes, but can he do it? if not HE will be unemployed!
A very enjoyable Christmas movie that must be added to your collection and watched every Christmas!",1355875200,,809,4.429530201342282

2163527,5,B00062WUVY,"This is a great and unforgettable movie.  Why they changed the title to 'Holiday for Love' I have no idea.  It may well be that someone thought it would not sell well enough without a more 'politically correct name'.  I'm not sure.  I'm sure if the word ""Christmas"" was returned to the title, it would sell far better.  I'm a little tired of seeing ""Christmas"" removed from everything.  Re-release it again as 'Christmas In My Hometown'.

Now, the movie really hits home to those who have experienced small town living, lay-offs at Christmas, and romantic relationships in the country.  Wonderful movie.  Recommend it highly.",1354060800,,625,4.9326923076923075

2163531,5,B00062WUVY,"For those of us partial to these sweet holiday movies, this one is an absolute gem.  Yes, yes it's mushy with the predictable ending, but it's well acted with a great fun and romantic script, some good country music by Travis Tritt who also acts, and there's plenty of snow and small town folksiness.

I love Melissa Gilbert(Emma) and Tim Matheson(Jake), they're super in this, but I think the real star is the young actor who plays the daughter(Michelle Trachtenberg).  She steals the show!

Plotline: Big city corporate tractor company must downsize.  They send out spies to their factories to determine who will be cut.  Jake is forced to return to his hometown in Athens, Nebraska to do the dirty work.  On the way, a blizzard hits and strands him to the mercies of single mom, Emma, and her daughter at their home.  Love blossoms, but there are problems.  Emma's engaged to the sheriff(Tritt) and of course, also works with her family and the rest of the town at the much needed tractor factory.

There's lots of romance, conflict, endearing characters and comedy.  Plus, some gentle mysteries.  Who's stealing all the Christmas angels, and whatever happen to Jake's family?

We love this kind of innocent, candy cane stuff. If it drives you crazy- you've been warned- but either way- have a Merry Christmas!",1351296000,,1313,4.834080717488789

2163534,5,B00062WUVY,"Being a long time fan of both Melissa Gilbert and Tim Matheson, I made sure that I saw this film when it was first shown years ago on network television as ""Christmas in My Hometown"".  And I loved it, and still do.  I purchased it immediately when it was finally released on dvd--the leads are charming, but it also helps that all of the minor roles are beautifully cast and played to the hilt by a terrific cast of character actors, all of whom are a hoot.  Also notable is Michelle Trachtenberg in one of her early roles as Gilbert's very wise, older-than-her years daughter--the kind of movie kid you can't help loving as she supports her single mom during some rough times.  The love story may be a bit predictable, but you can't help falling in love with the whole package and almost wishing you could spend Christmas with these wonderful people.",1349913600,2,851,4.542483660130719

It was a good movie and if I could, I would give it a 3.5 stars not just a 3.  Anyway, clean and wholesome, which is always appreciated, but a bit choppy in some parts. It didn't grab our family like ""The Christmas Card"", and I guess I was looking for something along the same lines.

So definitely check around.....Walgreens, Rite Aid, grocery stores, etc.  It's probably my favorite Melissa Gilbert movie and who doesn't love Tim Matheson!  Nice, handsome and a very humble actor. The girl that plays the daughter is adorable and a very good actress as well.  I have watched this movie every Christmas.  It's just a sweet story. I highly recommend the movie, but not for the prices on Amazon.  Melissa's acting was (and usually is) marginal but the story is wonderful and well written for a TV movie.",1309651200,2,649,4.640350877192983

It tells the story of a man who comes to a Nebraska town to downsize a tractor factory under the pretense of placing an order with them.  He falls in love with Melissa Gilbert and all of the town.  A town from his childhood.  I'm not sure why the name was changed.  My wife loved this movie so I bought it for her for Christmas.  I paid a lot of money for it, around $50.  I don't know why it was so expensive except, maybe it is hard to come by.  If that is the case, whoever owns the rights to it should produce more copies so the cost would be more reasonable.  Still it is a very sweet story which you would expect from Melissa Gilbert.  I would recommend this movie as a good wholesome romantic Christmas story.",1294099200,3,771,4.114093959731544

A nice holiday movie for anyone who still believes in the miracle of love. BUT..... it's not worth the outrageous $31.00 that sellers on Amazon are trying to sell it for. Shame on them for putting such a high price tag on this movie! I guess greed isn't reserved for executives in large corporations anymore.,1244419200,,426,4.4743589743589745
2163548,5,B00062WUVY,"Mostly know by the alternate title ""Christmas In My Hometown"", this is probably my favorite 'made for TV' holiday movie with great performances from Tim Matheson and Melissa Gilbert plus a great opening song from country singer Travis Tritt.  I too wonder why this DVD drifts in and out of production.  This movie seems most appropriate with today's economy.

And this movie does deliver, the acting's great, the story's fine (for this kind of movie), and most of all, the atmosphere's (bolstered by the Christmas tunes) fabulous.  Wish someone could re-release this so that the price would drop (it's currently $67.80 from Amazon's third party sellers) and bigger mass could enjoy it.

Tim's character is caught in a quandary between loyalty to his company and loyalty to his new-found love, Melissa.  There appears to be no way to resolve this irreconcilable conflict.  The ending is smashing.

So, what is it?  This is the third incarnation of this movie and already it is out of print again.  Why?

The answer is obvious to most people.  Here we have a story set in a small town in Nebraska, about ordinary farm people who have lived there all their lives.  So, how did this woman farmer have a kid with a strong California accent and diction out of the Bronx and not a hint of Midwest about her?  On top of that, this child is repugnant.  It isn't merely her fish-face, but her manner.

Top that off with the chorus that sings deliberately way out of tune and out of sync, and this kid is leading them.  It is grating, and it is a bad idea.  People can drag it and sing without spirit when they're depressed, and then with more spirit at the end, but they don't sing out of tune and then suddenly become musicians.

The screenwriter and executive producer, Darrah Cloud, has to bear the responsibility.  She put up the money to have her screenplay produced.  She could have prevented this atrocity of casting, but didn't.  Why?

Bottom line: see it anyway, but keep your remote handy ready to hit the Fast Forward button.",1200528000,4,1616,4.538194444444445

Very good acting, good script, the story is even highly up to date with people loosing their jobs not just here in Germany. One would wish there were more people like Jake coming to their senses, at least trying make things better. Very nice dream!",1197504000,11,383,4.647058823529412

8037739,5,B00062WUVY,"Holiday For Love is also known as Christmas in My Home Town (1996)
During a national economic downturn, a Chicago executive businessman (Tim Matheson) is sent to the small country Nebraska town where he grew up, to assess the financial viability of a tractor factory (one of many across the mid-west), and decide which of the workers in the local tractor factory, that has supplied the town with jobs across the generations, and supports about half of the current town population, should get the boot when the downsizing begins. He gets side-tracked when he falls in love with a local, cute single-mom (whose husband died about ten years ago, in a snowy car accident near Christmas, leaving a daughter, Noelle, played by Michelle Tractenberg), who works in the factory, and whose father is the manager of the factory.
(The story is broadly similar to ""New in Town"" (with Renee Zellwegger, and Harry Connick, Jr.) where a gung-ho woman goes into a small country town with a concealed, dire (economic downsizing) purpose, only to encounter the living reality of the community and its local but threatened business, and be changed by it.)
(It is similar, also, to ""All She Wants for Christmas"" [2008] starring Monica Keena (of ""Dawsons Creek"" and ""Entourage"") as Noelle Dunn, a small town woman, working on a graduate accountancy research project (investigating the financial strengths and weaknesses of the home-town factory where her mother works), with big business dreams working as an efficiency expert at Aikens Christmas decoration factory, the local Christmas ornament company).
The beautiful widow is dating the local (a country hick, but a nice man at heart) town sheriff (who has another hopeful attractive admirer waiting in the wings  fortunately).
The daughter is attempting to be the conductor of the worst old peoples Christmas choir known to man or beast, including a semi-geriatric old man known only as Happy.
The visiting businessman has lost touch with his grumpy father.
AND somebody in the town is STEALING Christmas angels (in manger scenes and dioramas, )!
AND there is a mysteriously vacant old house. The plot thickens, 
The story is comfortably predictable, and warmly sentimental, but basically pleasant, well told, and rewarding.
