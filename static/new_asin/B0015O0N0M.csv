""Oh No NOT another Barney! One was too many!""
Look, there's a lot more to this show than that. This is twice as educational, twice as fun, its colorful, and your kid will probably enjoy it.
Assuming your a:
Christian who loves God that is.
If you ARE NOT---!
This may not be for you. I won't be the one to infringe on others beliefs here. I will expect you to do the same.

This DVD was made by ~Christians~, to be both educational and express good values, while still being fun for the little ones. Adults will not find this movie/ show very entertaining(you will be bored mostly), like other animated movies might entertain, but its not really supposed to, it is wholesome good entertainment for the little ones you have running around.

Good for young ages starting at around 1yr and older.

The Christian values in this DVD aren't overly done, but they do Pray, as all Christians do/should, and God is mentioned a couple of times, and songs are sung about him once or twice. If this offends you DONT BUY IT. Its quite simple really.

This is my opinion, based on the facts I understand. I hope your little ones enjoy it as much as mine do.
Thanks for reading.",1391904000,4,1188,4.410958904109589
8259234,4,B0015O0N0M,"My 2 year old loves this video.  She especially loves the song ""Do what I do"".  It is a catchy follow the leader song that she has to get out of her chair to dance to.  The video is well done, the songs are catchy with good values, and the story is cute.  She asks for it often.  My only negative was mentioned in another review.  You have to have the remote to use this video.  You cannot just put it in and play.",1271203200,6,414,3.857142857142857
8259235,2,B0015O0N0M,"This is NOT for long car trips with very young children.  The default setting is just to play a single song.  You must be looking at the video to scroll down to ""play all"", so you can't simply hit play from the front seat.  At home it's quite entertaining though.",1249776000,,263,4.22
8259236,5,B0015O0N0M,"Great investment.  We sure hope more Boz videos are on the way.  We've gotten all that are available to date.  Our grandkids (ages 1-4)are enthralled with them and beg to watch them.  Our youngest said ""Boz"" before he got to ""Daddy.""",1211414400,5,233,4.609756097560975
