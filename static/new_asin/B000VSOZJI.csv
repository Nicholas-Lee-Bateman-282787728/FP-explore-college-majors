8660201,4,B000VSOZJI,"""Finally!"", I thought to myself, ""someone's made an Alfred J. Kwak DVD, and it's for sale on Amazon!"" If you're a fan of the series, as I am, you've probably scoured the web looking for a DVD box, fruitlessly (unless you happen to speak Dutch).

The series itself is, of course, superb. Alfred J. Kwak is a cartoon unlike any other that I know of: kids are treated as intelligent human beings. The characters in Alfred J. Kwak suffer. Some, like Dolf, are evil. Not all is well. But things often go right in the end. The bad guy is bad because he's misunderstood, but he's still bad. When he starts talking, you understand why he acts like he does. You still dislike him for it. And it doesn't fix him instantly. When something tragic occurs (***spoiler***: Alfred's parents and siblings die at the beginning of the second episode), it doesn't turn out perfectly in the end. But it turns out good enough. Those are lessons which are barely touched even in movies/series made for adults, and here, they're handled perfectly.

In case you didn't know, Alfred J. Kwak was based on comic books made by Herman Van Veen, for UNICEF. The goal was to sensibilize children, to let them know that some things are wrong in this world (war, AIDS, etc.), and that those who matter the most are those who care. The series succeeds amirably in handling those difficult themes.

For that, I wish I could give this product 5 stars. The series itself gets those 5 stars. However, the DVDs themselves get a one, one-and-a-half star rating. When reading the following paragraphs, keep in mind that I am discussing only the DVDs as a support medium, not the series' itself's content.

The first of the four DVDs is the worst. There is no menu. No language / subtitles option. The DVD is divided in three chapters, which correspond to the three episodes. However, the episodes are in order 1-3-2, which can be pretty confusing.

The other three DVDs are not as bad. There is a menu (still no language options, though), and you can access each episode by choosing it in the chapters menu. Sub-chapters (chapters inside a single episode) would have been nice, but as far as I know, it's not standard on DVDs of television series, so no fault here. The episodes are in correct order. DVDS 2-3-4 would get, on their own, a 2-2.5 star rating. Subpar, but functional. The first DVD gets a 1 star rating.

The English dub is also atrocious. Characters who are supposed to be kids (such as Ollie, Alfred's classmate) have adult voices. The actors who voice Alfred, Henk and Dolf are average to above-average. The rest of the cast can hardly emote.

To sum up, I would say that this is a bad box of DVDs for a truly great series. The quality won't stop me from buying the rest of the series (IF the DVDs ever come out, a big if), however, an upgrade would be welcome. Having language and subtitles options allowing one to watch the original Dutch version with English subtitles would be ideal.",1204156800,11,2962,4.5879017013232515
