8479462,5,B005MKSR3U,Kind of interesting that there's a chance when our planet earth about to be invaded by aliens from outer space proves that we are not alone in the universe but are the aliens friendly or hostile we don't know but if they do arrive we will be ready after all I got the Seti@home laptop computer to pick up any alien signal out there in space.,1447632000,,341,4.181818181818182
8479463,5,B005MKSR3U,"Nation Geographic does Sci Fi ??!!!  Very interesting!  I do not know how many more ways they could twist this. But I hope they try. Imagination is part of the inspirational part of National Geo. Or,,,uh,,,something like that.  I like it a lot.",1416182400,,244,4.627906976744186
8479464,2,B005MKSR3U,"""When Aliens Attack"" starts with an interesting concept. It has some good interviewers with ""in the know"" people. But it lacks a lot. First, the special effects are good the first time you see them, sort of interesting the 2nd time the SAME clip is shown, but by the time the SAME few seconds of alien ships is shown, they are boring and redundant. Boring and redundant. The same goes for the crowd scenes. Stock news footage of crowds running, or destroyed building, or traffic jams are repeated over and over and over and over and over. Boring and repetitive. Finally, the inconsistency is almost laughable. The aliens shrug off a nuclear attack because they have shielding or metallurgy which is impenetrable, but in the end they are defeated by people floating up to the ships in balloons? Really? If a nuclear blast cannot get through to the inside of the ship, how will a soldier armed with pliers, and wire cutters, rifles and grenades? Will the soldiers just unlock the doors and walk in?",1409961600,,996,4.6971428571428575
8479465,2,B005MKSR3U,"As an aside to the whole venture, anyone who has ever seriously considered ""where are they"" has to have considered Fermi's Paradox several times over. So the physicist ""expert"" shoots himself in the foot with his very introduction and how ""very likely"" it is we'll ever see an alien race. Ever. As to the film:

I'm going to give this an extra star because it did hold my attention for most of the mockumentary. My problem is that it tried so hard to take itself seriously. There are so many contradictions to the premise for the invasion as it moves forward and our attacks become (spoilers) more successful culminating in a balloon assault on a ship that had shielding that would block a nuke from penetrating it. That's, of course, operating under the very large assumption that any non-interstellar craft would have or be capable of generating the same defenses that the larger interstellar craft would need for such travel.

My real problem is with ""Why they came"". They're here to harvest plant and animal life? First for food, which--come on--who wants to eat a pinecone? Then as we ""discover"" they're robot drones and we decide they're using plants and animals for biofuels--fuel being conveniently left out of the reasons why they wouldn't attack earth as they would not attack for other resources like water and minerals because there are easier ways to get them than attacking a populated planet. We're launching nukes and they're blowing up our power plants in the first hours of invasion but they came here for chlorophyll as an energy source?  An energy source reliant on the freaking sun (as in the plants use sunlight for food and protein EATS said plants for food/fuel)? They can have the solar panels off my house and cut out the middle man. War averted. Just--good luck using any solar reliant system in the very dark interstellar reaches between planets or getting it to provide enough power for a Faster Than Light drive. A potato might run a light bulb but its not efficient enough to power my refrigerator, forget FTL.

So the question remains unanswered as to why an alien race would attack a planet populated by crazy two-legged psychopaths who will--WILL--nuke not just one but every city twice over whether it works or not on their ships but in the weak hope that it would irradiate the area and make these little green guys decide we're too crazy to eat. There are only two reasons why any race would ever visit this planet with violent intent: to make sure our crazy species never leaves it or to live on it themselves. If its the former, there wouldn't be any brave defense and resistance fighting over years and generations. They'd just glass the planet and be done ah la Halo Reach. If its the later then the historical research they should be doing shouldn't be into insurgent tactics but into what European colonists did to Native Americans.

If I can figure this out, why can't these experts?",1403481600,,2927,4.742632612966601
8479466,4,B005MKSR3U,"I loved the first half of the show cause I was rooting for the aliens. The second half  slips into Hollywood narcissm that underdog  survivors somehow  thrive and pop out babies in the woods, never running out of bottled water .Then miraculously all these helium  ballons (that weren't destroyed during the main invasion) are deployed up a last chance suicide missions into the open and vulnerable underbelly  hatch of the alien ship, (Independance Day style)  successly and finaly blowing them up. LIke  that will ever happen. Ive had dreams since I was a child  of these ships and mother ship. Trust me,after they open up any doorway or  hatch they seal it back up tight , and they also watch and make sure that no  foreign bodies sneak in as well while its open.

Whats further insulting is that the  conclusion was the aliens were machines all along or aliens who sent their AI  ships to do the dirty work, all for some tree collecting. Aliens always look like lizards, monsters or freaky deformed giant bugs and now AI intelligence.  Never do we admit that aliens could be  more  moral then us , or more noble, or more physically beautiful and simply decide to wipe us out one day cause we are ugly and unintelligent, offensive (Look at our choices of entertainment)  and destructive to our own environment.

If aliens decide to take us out, it most likely will be a  mission to  save our planet and species from the destructive native of ourselves whose only interest is to overfish,  overpollute and over rape our own resources without even giving back,  We are  a cancer upon the earth and its animal species.",1403481600,,1617,4.656028368794326
8479467,5,B005MKSR3U,"I found this DVD very enjoyable and quite an eye opener about how this world and the government agencies would respond to the threat of an alien invasion. I myself
always thought that the threat would be miminial because I thought that if advanced alien intelligence came into contact with Earth it would be benevolent, however this DVD pointed out that the possiblity with expert testimony may not be the case.
The special effects were also excellent in my opinion rivaling that of any Sci-Fi movie
or television series. Thanks for having it avaliable- Philip Gover",1371772800,3,566,4.90625
8479468,5,B005MKSR3U,"Fantastic movie.  Saw this on TV and was glad that I was able to  buy the DVD.  Very realistic and shows a lot of things that you can do if something like this ever happens.  Makes you think of what is important and what is not.  I have recommended this to my children and other people. Well put together and mind blowing.  Can't praise it enough,",1370131200,2,347,4.181818181818182
