1389713,5,B000053GTD,"I was given this DVD by someone who knows I'm a Carmelite-ophile (see my review of the Chandos CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poulenc-The-Carmelites/dp/B000HC2OKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poulenc: The Carmelites</a>). As is often the case, the stage production yielding this video succeeds by being visually minimalistic. Better yet, director Marthe Keller -- yes, the elegant European actress who's been working steadily for four decades now -- gives us something way better to look at than scenery: Opera singers who really act! For brevity I'll only cite two scenes, Madame Lidoine's (the New Prioress's) speeches in Acts II and III. In the earlier one, the nuns appear to listen very intently, quite in contrast to some productions where they appear to be marking time until the serene Ave Maria chorus. During the latter monologue, the nuns not only take their Mother Superior's words to heart, but also devise a simple but striking final act of defiance against their anti-clerical persecutors.

Anne Sophie Schmidt is superb as the protagonist Blanche, not surprising since her other Poulenc opera video, La Voix Humaine (on Kultur), shows her to have a deep understanding of this composer. There are several other fine performances here, but the real ""It"" Girl in this show is Patricia Petibon. Her interpretation of the young Sister Constance is right on the money, and the camera truly loves her. Daringly, Keller asks her and the other 14 members of the nuns' chorus to take the stage alone for the opera's brutal finale -- and to stay there!  I won't reveal how they represent dying onstage, except to say that it's resourcefully foreshadowed by the Old Prioress's final facial expression in her Act I death scene. Finally, special mention for adapting Keller's stage direction for DVD goes to Don Kent, for whom [...] asserts that this was a first major TV adaptation of an opera performance. I see that over the years he's been engaged to do several more, which comes as no surprise after seeing this impeccable video.",1180137600,18,2081,5.303030303030303
1389714,3,B000053GTD,"I read the existing reviews after viewing this DVD on a first class audio-visual system.  Firstly, what we have here is a magnificent performance of the opera. All parts are well sung and well acted and, much to the point, the singers look their parts. Secondly, the staging is quite good as is the video direction.  One is brought into the action.  The sound, however, was a problem. On many newer DVDs I have found audio equal or better than the best CDs. The sound on this DVD was not in this league.  All was recorded at a rather high level and tended to distort if played at a normal level.  The singers seemed much to the front of the orchestra and, thus, some orchestral details were slighted. I wonder whether the sound was compressed. This is not, then, a DVD I would listen to without video, and even watching this DVD the sound quality reduces the impact of the whole.",1122422400,23,879,4.434782608695652
1389715,5,B000053GTD,"I haven't purchased this DVD yet, but I will do so. I was alarmed by the review that complains about the audio and video quality, and so I checked the Gramophone review because Gramophone is a stickler about technical quality. Here's what the Gramophone review written by Alan Blyth says about this issue: ""Video direction, sound and picture quality are all admirable. This is one of the most worthwhile opera performances yet to appear in the new format.""",1097971200,15,456,4.858974358974359
1389716,5,B000053GTD,"This is one of the most powerful opera productions I've ever seen, hindered by poor quality video and audio.  the audio isn't as bad as on their DVD of Salieri's _Falstaff_, where the speakers sound constantly overloaded, though it's still a problem.  The digital artifacting is even worse.  It's a great opera, powerfully staged and filmed, but it looks like a budget DVD that ought to sell for $3.99.  They're taking advantage of opera fans on the assumption that they are rich, and putting out shoddily authored DVDs of great productions.  Unless they do a serious reauthoring of the disc, I'll try to find it used, whcih isn't bloody likely.  The presentation quality isn't worth what they're asking for it.",1075161600,18,711,4.883333333333334

1389718,4,B000053GTD,"This opera doesn't lose much from minimalist staging, which is exactly what it gets in the Opera du Rhin's production.  I compare it to a production that the Lyric Opera of Boston did a few years ago, also minimalist, and equally effective.  It's all psychology, fear of life versus fear of death, religious conviction versus the expedience of bowing to the popular will, etc.  None of this requires elaborate sets or costumes.  All that matters are the singers' voices and mannerisms, and in this production they are more than adequate. Not every opera has to be a Met extravaganza to work.",1013040000,9,591,4.821782178217822
1389719,4,B000053GTD,"I must state from the git-go that I love this opera, and that this is a very good performance.  There are many of us who cut their teeth on the Metropolitan Opera production some years ago, and while this doesn't match it's emotional impact, it is still a jewel - just a little different.  I think it may have been a mistake to cast Anne-Sophie Schmidt as Blanche.  She sings well, but sounds very mezzo-ish and a bit strained in many of the higher passages.  She's a pretty good actress, but seems to struggle more with the notes than with her faith.  And she can't begin the portray the slightly ""unhinged"" component in Blanche's personality that Maria Ewing did so memorably at the Metropolitan. The rest of the cast is very strong, visuals are never less than commanding, and the final scene, while a bit stagey and symbolic, is quite gripping. Poulencs' gem of an opera is an acquired taste, I think, but well worth the acquisition. I advise you to buy this and watch (and listen) about 4-5 times - you'll be hooked.  Now if only the Metropolitan (M. Ewing, J. Norman, R. Crespin) would release its performance on DVD !!!",992908800,34,1126,4.5495049504950495
1389720,5,B000053GTD,"Apparently the reviewers below had no prior exposure to this work before viewing the DVD in question. That can be a handicap when coming to a work such as ""Carmelites."" Perhaps I am a bit better equipped to judge, as this is one of my favourite operas of all time.
This is a truly excellent performance, recorded in 1999 at the Opera National du Rhin. Aside from a small spoken scene in Act Three where Blanche learns of the arrest of the sisters, the performance is complete.
The cast is uniformly excellent, but particular mention must be made of Anne-Sophie Schmidt's highly moving Blanche and Nadine Denize's haunting old Prioress with a riveting death scene. Additionally, Patricia Petibon is a charming Constance and Hedwig Fassbender a sympathetic Mere Marie.
The sets and costumes are simple and evocative without getting in the way of the action, and although I'd quibble with the staging of the final climactic scene, everything else that is done is done extremely well.
In short, if you want a DVD version of ""Dialogues of the Carmelites,"" I really can't see this fine edition being bettered anytime soon.",991699200,42,1116,4.878947368421053

I have seen this opera live, and wanted to relive this opera. So, I ordered it & waited
to see & hear their story once again.
  This copy of the ""Dialouges Des Carmelites"" did not disappoint. The lead roles were
sung with passion and affection. The acting also was 1st rate. All in all, this opera was
as great as the one I had seen years ago.

7929932,5,B000053GTD,"I first read To Quell the Terror: The mystery of the vocation of the sixteen Carmelites of Compiegne, William Bush's brilliant correcting of where the opera gets the story wrong or misplaces characters.  The most glaring of these is the insertion of the opera's main character, Blanche , who never existed.  Despite knowing this fiction and other historical fantasies when I experienced the opera, to my surprise, I found it deeply moving.  Rather than dwelling on the inaccuracies I submitted to the opera's power.  And it is powerful.  The dialogue between Blanche and the novice mistress and her subsequent death scene in particular are wrenching.  Then there is Sister Constance's energetic simplicity and the finale ........!  I could go on.  In short, the fate of the Carmelites is factual and the opera communicates an overwhelming emotional truth despite some historical errors and liberties taken.
One reviewer longs for the Met to release it's version of the Dialogues.  As good as the Met is, it's hard to imagine it improving on some of the scenes in this production.  If you are at all drawn to historical religious drama,  watch this opera.",1431129600,2,1154,5.021052631578947

The subtitles are poorly synced, at least on my copy.  They are always late and it distracts from getting totally involved.  Sometimes it almost seems that the subtitle is placed with a character singing a different line!  For an opera where what is being said (or sung) is so important, it's so disappointing!

Is it just my copy or is it the same on all of them?  I'd buy a new copy in a second if I knew it might be better on the new copy.",1366502400,,649,4.495726495726496

7929937,4,B000053GTD,"The newest taping of Poulenc's Dialogue of the Carmelites brings the total of DVD's to four: surely a record for an opera composed after WWII, though truth to tell it is essentially written in a conservative and accessible idiom, Poulenc's; thus considering that it was written years after Wozzeck and Lulu, it doesn't challenge the listener as the aforementiond works do, but rather engages the receptive auditor in a very personal and beautiful work.

My first Dialogue emanated from Strasbourg and has the virtue of a number of francophone artists, a real plus in French opera. Additionally all the singers are truly engaged under Keller's direction. The voices are steady, not a wobble to be heard; this is more unusual these days than you would think. My second was the Scala production under Muti. The cast is mostly German and American. Small roles were undertaken by native singers. The production boasts of Anja Sila as the Old Prioress who has only two scenes, the interview with Blanche and her death bed scene. Silja at this time had a voccal range of about four notes, top notes are not pitched and the low notes are mostly growled. The role, however, provides a singing actor with great opportunitites. Yet one only has to hear Nadine Denize (Strasbourg) and Harries (Hamburg)to realize that Poulenc did write a musical line and when followed the scene is infirnitely more more moving, both dramatically and musically.

The newest entry is from Hamburg. The cast is most German with the exception of Kathryn Harries who is  from the UK. Blanche is sung by Alexia Voulgaridou; I would assume that she is either from Greece or possibly Roumania. Even though there is not a francophone artist involved, the text is treated far better than the Scala set. For many this will not be a factor and even though Poulenc was alleged to have said that he wanted the work performed in the vernacular of the country it was performed; only the Australian set is sung in English. The Met for the most part has performed in it in English although if memory serves me correctly there was a Saturday broadcast that was in French.

The newest set can be highly recommended with only one caveat. Gabriele Schnaut as Mere Marie. Thank God the role is (relatively) small. I have found it appalling that this singer has had engagements that are all out of proportion to the contribution she makes. I find the voice ugly: there is no onther word. She was a wretched Ortrud in a staging of Lohengrin from Bayreuth. There is also a Turandot. A wobble intrudes whenever she opens her mouth. It is truly unfortunate, but this should not be a deal breaker even though she is trumped in the two other sets mentioned above. The remainder of the cast provides distinguished performances of great beauty. The surprise casting is Anne Schwanenwilms as Mme. Lidoine, a strong artist who dominates the last act. She dominates because Poulenc wrote it that way, not because Schvananwilms is making a ""star turn"".

The direction is by Nikolaus Lehnhoff; for reasons known only to Herr Lehnhoff he has chosen to update the setting to pressent time. In an opera in which the main protagonists are nuns, this more couldn't be more absurd and while many orders have moved away from the conventional habit, the visual image that most people have of Carmelite nuns is not an ""updated"" one in view of their vows of silence and continual prayer and indeed, these nuns have not chosen to adopt a more twentieth century habit. Aside from this one idiosyncracy the settings are minimalist, a path chosen by the Strasbourg and Scala productions and doubtless the Australian.",1276128000,18,3637,4.8128
7929938,5,B000053GTD,"I spent a nice couple of hours reacquainting myself with this performance which I had not seen perhaps since its release over a decade ago.  I remember being very moved by it then, and fail to understand as to why I waited so long to experience it again.

What a stunning, theatrically compelling and insightful production Marthe Keller put upon the Strousburg stage.  Many would complain about the starkness of the set which is, more frequently than not, bare.  Poulenc's opera (as John Dexter's similarly spartan stage proved decades before) holds up well in such a ""setting"" allowing not only more detailed portrayals of its finely nuanced characters, but for the viewer/listener to focus on those portrayals.  The reward is a rich one in such a case as this.

Anne Sophie Schmidt gives us a deeply touching portrayal of Blanche, her face - particularly when framed by her wimple - registering every one of the frightened by the world, heroine's emotions.  Those nuances come through, too, in her handling of the music, though (as is the case with several other cast members) high notes can feel a bit screeched out (of course, Poulenc is not easy on his singers, requiring some specatcular ""leaping"" effects at the ends of phrases).

The always wonderful Patricia Petibon gives a performance of Constance that elevates the chirpy young nun to a place of genuine dramatic prominence.  The scenes between Blanche and Constance are powerful, a real connection is made between these two young novices which makes the final moment of an already overwhelmingly emotional scene, almost unbearable in its poignancy and strength.

Hedwig Fassbender is a strong presence, and captures brilliantly the almost over zealousness with which she wants the order to pursue martyrdom - it's almost an obsession.  Her street scene with the Priest when she realizes she is not to be martyred presents a powerfully conflicted and wilfull woman denied the one thing she most desired.

Even if it took a few minutes for me to warm up to the voice of Valrie Millot, she made a fine and touching Mme. Lidoine - entirely believeable in her modesty.

I have always been something of a fan of Nadine Denize and she captures, quite perfectly, the severity, hope and charm of Madame de Croissy.  Her death scene is (as it built into the role itself) one of the most chilling, terrifying moments one can experience on stage.  I loved the connection here between de Croissy and Blanche, the young nun cradling the dying woman - a symbol of authority and order she so much needs in her life.  I dare anyone to keep a dry eye here!

As a director, Keller provides some amazing effects in her production, an  almost air-raid style roar near the end, the filmed sequences in black and  white which are captured beautifully on DVD (and which only during the  curtain calls does one notice the movie screen at the rear, meaning the in- house audience got the same effect).  Particularly, the violent ripping off of the sisters' facial veils by the Revolution Council officers, and the March to the Scaffold.

The final scene is simply staged, the nuns - all now in tattered white with self-decorated black grease chalked crosses each marked herself with as they were condemned to death, holding each other together in a huddle, hands and arms draping themselves almost as a single organism before simply lining up for the guillotine, each collapsing at her moment of death until Blanche's turn, whereupon she walks amongst the corpses of her fallen sisters, fearless and serene.

Film director, Don Kent, in (apparently) his first televised opera production does not have a single faux pas - capturing every moment for maximum impact.  His ability to captures the myriad - almost never ending - dance of shadows and light, minimizing the use of the facial close-up too prevalent in opera videocasts these days, all revealing someone with a genuine gift.  (Kent has since gone to be video director for some truly wonderful operatic DVD experiences:  Platee, Lucia, Onegin, Traviata, Ariadne, and more).

Conductor, Jan Latham-Koenig ""feels"" this score to his bones and the results show in his work with the chorus and orchestra of the Opera National du Rhin forces.",1270944000,10,4230,4.912798874824191
7929939,5,B000053GTD,"This production of Poulenc's inspired opera comes with few frills. The production is spare and dependent on light and the mood the singers can create. It adds up to an exceptionally moving performance, one that is very sensitive to the rarified atmosphere that makes this opera such a unique experience. The singing is uniformally good and the acting under the direction of Keller is insightful. The big moments like the death of the old prioress and the monologue of her replacement are inspired, as is the handling of that final wrenching scene. The latter is not done literally but is in keeping with the more interior mood that is sustained throughout. If you have any interest in this work, seeing this dvd is a must.",1256169600,3,722,4.784
7929940,5,B000053GTD,"Unlike some reviewers, I have found no fault with the technical aspects of this recording.  It is in stereo only, but despite this the sound is first rate.

I have written at length praising this production as distinct from the TDK production from La Scala.  Here is a copy of my review of that production:

"" Get the Arthaus production, September 30, 2007
By  Archie (Ottawa ON Canada) - See all my reviews
I usually tend to agree with Scott Morrison's reviews. However, this time I only partially agree with him. Yes, ""Dialogues of the Carmelites is one of the greatest Twentieth Century operas. Yes the minimalist set is stunningly effective, as is the lighting and the choreography of the nuns. And yes, it is a very good production on stage; although I do hate it when there is a scene change and suddenly from the relatively dim lighting on stage one gets a bright full shot of the orchestra and then a close-up on Mr. Muti. This is jarring and grossly interferes with the atmosphere and momentum of the piece.

But Dr. Morrison must not have seen the other DVD of ""Dialogues"" by Opera national du Rhin (1999) on Arthaus. I suspect that were he to have done so, he would have held back the superlatives on the Scala production because there would be nothing left to use to praise the other, which in my opinion is so much better. I do not want to detract too much from this production, because it is very good and one should experience it. But if you are to have only one, I would strongly recommend that you get the Arthaus production.

Dr. Morrison has written at length about the TDK production, so I will briefly make a few points about the Arthaus one. The set and the costumes are equally minimalist, stark and extremely effective. The final scene which Dr. Morrison has praised is done better here, (and was done first); and the lead up to it in the prior scenes is much more emotionally telling. This feels like a much more intimate production with the singers and the orchestra very well balanced. The singing and acting are wonderful. There is a much better flow and momentum to the piece, and this is greatly enhanced by the camera work. Normally I do not particularly like too many close-ups (and have been severely critical of Don Kent for his editing of Lucie de Lammermoor on TDK), but here it feels right and appropriate, and it greatly enhances the psychological and moral issues which are so central to this opera.

In my opinion, the Opera national du Rhin production, directed by Marthe Keller and conducted by Jan Latham-Koenig is the one to have and to experience again and again.

[I have not seen the Kultur production, because reading the reviews it appears that they have yet again come up with a sub standard recording (no subtitles, no liner notes) of what probably was a good production. As I have written in reviews of very disappointing Kultur recordings where they sabotage a good production with a bare minimum (if even that) DVD, it would be a blessing if they would go bankrupt.]""",1191110400,7,3021,4.600371747211896
