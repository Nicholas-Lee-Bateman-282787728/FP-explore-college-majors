3649201,5,B001ILFUDW,"Our grankids love this musical video. They learn so much from watching it: world geography, traditional music from all continents, various customs and how music can be a common theme for all of us to live together. Our grandkids become totally involved in this great presentation.",1258329600,,280,5.108695652173913
3649202,5,B001ILFUDW,"The Baby Einstein DVDs have been a great, before bed, treat for my 2 year old.  She looks forward to watching her DVD as an end of day treat.  They are also great when you have to get things done!  World Music incorporates wonderful tunes and instruments that I didn't even the know the names or origins of. Highly recommend.",1251676800,,325,4.383333333333334
3649203,4,B001ILFUDW,"I like the content, but the DVD seems like it suffered budget cuts in the editing room.  My son still enjoys it and they offer a 'grow with me' option of play, which is new.",1250380800,,173,3.942857142857143
3649204,1,B001ILFUDW,"Watered-down, dumbed-down, sanitized music. I know that's Baby E's m.o. for the most part but come on. Not only is the music bad, the choice of images is also boring. I will not subject my toddler to this again. Yikes.",1248825600,,218,4.475
3649205,5,B001ILFUDW,"My son and I both love watching and listening to this DVD. While some of the backgrounds are a little annoying when it comes to contrast with the puppets, most of it is simply wonderful.",1245542400,,186,4.3428571428571425
3649206,4,B001ILFUDW,My son really enjoyed this movie. The music they picked was acuarate but not loud. It's good for before bedtime. I would suggest this for kids who like music and to use as part of a bedtime routine. We watch it often when we want some down time for our son.,1243555200,,257,4.0588235294117645
3649207,4,B001ILFUDW,"I got this the other day for my die-hard 10-month-old Baby Einstein fan.  We were hoping for a little more exposure to world music because he really seems to like music that is heavy on percussion.  He loves it, but perhaps not as much as his favorite...World Animals!  I wish there as a little better sampling of world music and I wish Baby Einstein would come out with a Reggae dvd!  Overall - great dvd as usual!",1243209600,,415,4.35064935064935
3649208,5,B001ILFUDW,"This was given as a gift, the parents totally enjoyed watching with the little one. :-)
They said it was a great addition to the others they have.

Baby Einstein dvd's and cd's are perfect for babies and older children. The music and the colors really hold their attention.",1241395200,2,273,4.571428571428571
3649209,1,B001ILFUDW,"I purchased this video hoping to find joyful music from the world: polkas, tango, mariachis, african music.
But you can't find any of those.
The dvd is a collage of images with music composed by the baby einstein musicians, which doesn't represent the Music of the world.
It is very boring. My children, who are the Baby Einstein biggest fans hardly look at it.
Dissapointing.",1239667200,10,376,4.8
3649210,4,B001ILFUDW,"Get out your drums, shake your maracas and flip a rainstick. The Baby Einstein World Music DVD features songs and music from around the world in performed in the typical mellow, synthesized Baby Einstein fashion. Images from each of the seven continents and a variety of musical instruments accompany the music. Jane the jet setting monkey flies a plane over a spinning globe and takes babies and kids along for the journey. The monkey also stars in the silly puppet shows that break up the segments, each segment featuring a different continent. The DVD includes a few new play modes: ""Grow with Me"", ""Select a Segment"" and ""Discovery Cards."" The main feature runs 37 minutes.

We prefer viewing mode 2 over viewing mode 1. Intended for toddlers and kids, the ""Grow With Me"" viewing mode (#2) plays the images along with text and spoken language, instead of just visuals and music. Also, the kids really enjoy the DVD when I bring out some instruments for them to use while viewing. The instruments featured in the DVD are a wood flute, maracas, a rainstick, didgeridoo, djembe (drum), harp, and pipa (stringed instrument). My kids especially like watching the bonus Select a Segment: World Music Songs. Sung by children, the songs include ""Shoo Fly"", ""Aloutte"", ""Arroz con Leche"" and ""Kogame, Kogame"".

To be honest, I was expecting a little more lively variation of world music from Baby Einstein. The slower tempo segments (Asia, Antarctica) aren't as interesting for my kids as the upbeat ones. We are used to listening to Putumayo label music and would have liked to see Baby Einstein incorporate more energy in their musical selections this time around. I also wish the segments included more images of babies from around the world and fewer landscape/water shots. The DVD and CD are recommended if you want calming, soothing world music and have enjoyed previous Baby Einstein music products.",1239321600,5,1900,4.971698113207547
3649250,2,B001ILFUDW,I thought this video was going to be great since my son loved the world of rythem so much but after two mintues in his attention was else were. Real Let down.,1353369600,,158,3.96875
3649251,3,B001ILFUDW,"As far as music goes, this is the WORST Baby Einstein DVD.  Each section is centered around a 'continent', although even that should be applied loosely.  N. America is dominated by a faux Native American music selection then by some faux Southwestern music too.  Asia is centered around some loosely based Oriental music, even though Asia encompasses so much more in terms of music and culture.  Antartica?!? Seriously.  Europe portion is mostly some Celtic mumbo jumbo.

As a former Music Educator, this DVD's soundtrack just makes me cringe with how wrong the music selections are.  My son though, is engaged throughout this collage of bad musical  representational 'world' motifs. I guess he really likes the puppets acting out scenes in between.

What drives me batty is the song with real children at the end.  They all look bored and like their parents are making sing and dance in the end video (my guess is they are the creators children, so I'm probably close with that one). My toddler can tell the kids aren't happy to be singing and dancing and he normally gets up and walks away at that point.",1324857600,,1106,4.773684210526316
3649252,3,B001ILFUDW,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child. I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I am unhappy with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and implying that this will make babies smarter!! These videos may be okay for kids, but tv/videos are generally are NOT good for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%, and 3) consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems. Interestingly, there is even some odds increase for bullying later on, for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2 and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2. Of course, I realize that this is probably not realistic for most people. There are studies that recommend preferably sitting with your child and watching t.v. together rather than just propping them in front of the tv by themselves, to make the experience more enriching and interactive (within reason of course and not longer than the recommended time). But I wanted to put this information out so that other parents and caregivers could make better informed parenting decisions. Maybe it will encourage some to limit television usage for babies and children and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time! Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance. Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1316649600,,2249,5.07027027027027
3649253,2,B001ILFUDW,"We own a number of other Baby Einstein videos, and while we do cycle through them all, I usually keep this one on the bottom of the stack. It has all the elements of a typical Baby Einstein video: puppets, toys, music, bright imagery. However, it really isn't very engaging. As an adult, I'm acutely aware of the fact that Julie Clark's ""creative consulting"" wasn't enough for Disney to create the magic of the original series. My 2 year old watches it, but doesn't seem engaged at all.

The entire show is centered around the theme of 'continents.' Each continent is introduced and then there is a medley of music (all or mostly synthesized) that is supposed to represent that continent. You'd think that if they went to all the trouble to organize the video in this way they'd have also made an attempt to show a large range of folk, classical, and indigenous styles. Unfortunately, the styles are rather limited. This really is not a video that will introduce your child to new musical styles. It's more like elevator music.

Next problem: Why did they include Antarctica? There are (obviously) no cultural traditions from that continent, so they chose to use it as a backdrop for new age style music. Had they simply eliminated this continent, they could have used the time to further explore Asia, which is given very incomplete coverage, even compared to the other continents. Better yet, why not scrap the whole ""continents"" theme and mix things up entirely? It's certainly not educational they way it is.

Even if the musical style/continent thing doesn't bother you, I suspect the 'Baby Einstein Kids' will. While I admire the attempt to include a group children who look like they come from around the world, the result is awkward. The kids clearly don't know each other and are uncomfortable on screen. The lip-sync song at the end is forced and hard to watch. I'd have rather they showed less of the kids ""singing"" on stage and more international video segments.

All in all, I think this is one of the weakest videos in the series, and I suggest you watch a library copy before purchasing it.",1310083200,,2105,4.727520435967302
3649254,1,B001ILFUDW,"This video has some beautiful cinematography. The music is pretty, but sometimes doesn't match the country that is being shown. My biggest problem with this video involves the misbehaving puppets. In one segment, one puppet steals the other puppet's hat and runs away. In another segment, one puppet has more fruit on its head so the other puppet pushes her. I think these puppets are modeling bullying behavior.",1308182400,,412,5.073529411764706
3649255,5,B001ILFUDW,"We love this DVD. It's one of the ""longer"" running DVDs (~39 minutes). It's my go-to DVDs. You can choose specific segments or play the whole DVD. It goes through each continent, picking an instrument common to the area as well as showing scenery indigenous to the area. My daughter loves the puppets and there are plenty of scenes with them. Other DVDs my daughter loves are Baby Noah, Neptune, Numbers Nursery, and Baby Beethoven. In my house this DVD is a must have!",1296432000,,469,4.595238095238095
3649256,2,B001ILFUDW,"As a musician, I have gotten a lot of musical related things for my nearly 8 month old son. When I saw Baby Einstein, World Music, and it had a 3+ months in the bottom corner, I bought it right away. I was excited to watch this with my son. I think I sat there for the first 10 minutes, trying to get my sons attention, waiting for the fun music to start, before I realized that it had actually started 10 minutes ago. The music is so mellow, that it might be the perfect music to have in the back ground for my son to fall asleep to.

This DVD is not what to get, if you are looking for something fun, with good beats, to dance and play with your baby.

If you are looking to show your baby animals from different countries, and some people, and some mellow music to try to calm them down before they go to bed, then maybe this product is for you.

I gave it two stars, because in between the little segments, he did like the little puppet shows.",1293062400,,947,4.026595744680851
3649257,5,B001ILFUDW,"I received the DVD quickly and it was in great condition - brand new.
Excellent product.  Excellent Seller.",1286755200,,107,4.944444444444445
3649258,5,B001ILFUDW,"This DVD is absolutely my favorite!! While, our son was learning about music and rhythm he was also learning the names and attributes of each continent. This was a fun and passive learning tool. I also gave this as a gift to my nephew, and his family loved it as well. Enjoy!",1284163200,,275,4.3076923076923075
3649259,5,B001ILFUDW,"This is the one trick in our hat that NEVER fails.  Our now almost a year daughter has been enjoying this dvd since about 6 months.  She LOVES this!  I don't let her watch alot of tv, but have tried a few other baby einstein dvds and barney, seseame street etc...  Doesn't really care for any of it, but this one dvd.  So she watches it a few times a week and never gets tired of it.  The music is great...and generally very fun to watch.  I do have to say that the typical baby einstein dvd is pretty boring.  This is not.  One of our best purchases!",1265328000,,551,4.027777777777778

8311146,5,B001ILFUDW,This is a great little CD.  It was actually my second so I knew it was good.  We gave the first one away and replaced it with a used one that skipped and had major problems.  I should have bought another new one.  I would recommend it for ages 3-5!,1389571200,,248,3.9

8311148,2,B001ILFUDW,Contains too many images and scenes of people in various countries playing authentic music and kids dressed up in those countries garments and images of those countries.

8311149,5,B001ILFUDW,We have about 21 Baby Einstein Movies.  This one is as good as the others.  My kiddo is almost 2 years old and has listened to mom play the congas since before he was born.  He likes all the percussion instruments.,1356048000,,214,4.170731707317073
