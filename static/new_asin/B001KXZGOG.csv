3674059,3,B001KXZGOG,"Mrs. Miniver, 1942 film

This story is based on an average English middle-class family. It begins in the summer of 1939. [How happy were they in the Great Depression?] A woman walks along a crowded sidewalk to buy an item in a store. She meets a minister in a train. Mrs. Minivers husband is an architect. A railroad agent wants to name his rose after Mrs. Miniver. Her husband looks at a used automobile; is it too costly? They have two young children and a maid. Their son Vin returns from Oxford; he has developed social consciousness. A young woman arrives for tea and has a request for the rose competition. Vin resents this request from Miss Devlin for her grandmother. Later they get together at a dance. The band plays God Save the King. The Germans marched into Poland, it means war says a bell ringer. The service is interrupted to announce the country is at war.

Horace was called up for the military, they say goodbye. Their son wants to join the RAF. He visits Miss Devlin, a siren warns people. People are cautioned about showing lights during blackouts. They are advised to stock up on sugar and canned goods. A radio broadcast from Germany boasts of victories. There is a hunt for a parachutist from an enemy airplane. A telephone calls Vin back to service. At night they hear airplanes overhead. Mr. Miniver is summoned, along with other men. Boats over 30 feet long are fueled and collected for a mission. Their destination is Dunkirk, to rescue the trapped BEF there. Mrs. Miniver sees a German sleeping in the bushes. He follows her home and asks for food and milk, then a coat. His right arm is hurt. Then he collapses. Mrs. Miniver calls the police. The German predicts many thousands will come after him and bomb England. The police take him away.

Mr. Miniver returns and catches up on sleep. She tells him about the German airman. Lady Beldon visits, she wants Carol to wait and not marry. But they agree at the end. At night they see searchlights and cannon fire. They enter a small bomb shelter for the night. Corrugate steel offered protection. Their home was damaged by the bombing. They show a local event that provides entertainment. Lady Beldon names the winners of that flower show. The stationmaster wins! The village was bombed. Carol was hit. Can they send an ambulance? Vin returns home, the church was damaged by bombing. This is a war of all the people. The people sing about Christian soldiers.

This is a slow-moving story that ells about the lives in one English village. Was it designed to keep costs low? The OPA required lowering costs for the war, reusing sets, less lighting (film noir). After Richard Neys movie career ended he became an investment advisor, then wrote The Wall Street Jungle as a warning to small investors.",1520467200,,2773,4.664621676891615
3674060,5,B001KXZGOG,"This movie tribute to the legendary British stiff upper lip came out in 1942, when the Allies were still reeling from the Fall of France, Pearl Harbor, and the Battle of Britain, and were in need of some uplifting and inspiration. There were certainly many Britons who wondered how much longer they could hold out against Hitler and who questioned what exactly they were fighting for. The answer was Mrs. Minniver, the Oscar winning movie by director William Wyler that forever cemented the image of the stoic and heroic ordinary Brits of World War II. The story revolves around the comfortably middle class family headed by architect Clem Miller (Walter Pidgeon) and his wife (the gorgeous Greer Garson) living with their two youngest children in an unnamed village in southeast England in the weeks before the outbreak of war in 1939. They occasionally indulge in purchases of woman's hats and roadsters but otherwise live a solid and uneventful life. Their oldest son Vin (a toothy Richard Ney) comes home from Oxford full of socialist ideals until he meets and falls in love with Carol Beldon (Theresa Wright), the granddaughter of the local lady of the manor (played by who else? Dame May Whitty). When war is declared, the father participates in the Dunkirk flotilla and Vin joins the RAF, but it's Mrs. Minniver who holds down the home front, confronting a fugitive Nazi paratrooper and dealing with death (it's not who you think it will be). The scene in the family's air raid bunker and its aftermath are truly inspiring, as is the last scene of the service in the bombed out village church (a scene reputedly much loved by President Franklin Roosevelt).

Sometimes too sentimentally English (as in the story line of the local flower show that was shamelessly stolen by the writers of Downtown Abbey decades later), Mrs. Miniver is an excellent representation of grace under fire. All the major cast members were nominated for the 1943 Oscars, with awards going to the film, Wyler, Garson, and Wright.",1520294400,,2010,4.911764705882353

3674064,4,B001KXZGOG,I very much enjoyed the movie.......BUT THE MOVIE FOR WHICH I WAS GIVEN TWO DAYS TO WATCH SO I WATCHED HALF OF THE MOVIE AND CAME BACK THE SECOND DAY TO WATCH THE BALANCE AND YOU HAD REMOVED IT FROM MY VIEWING.

3674065,5,B001KXZGOG,"One of the classics of the WWII era. Greer Garson plays her part masterfully as an upper-middle crust Britain who moves from a fanciful well-to-do life to confronting the horrors of war.  The movie is a study of how WWII affected rich and poor alike, and how everyone banded together for the war effort.",1515196800,,303,4.611111111111111

3674070,5,B001KXZGOG,"It is hard to tell of the importance of this movie and skip the details. Yes the technical stuff may not be that interesting in a review like, after first choice Norma Shearer rejected the title role (as she refused to play a mother), Greer Garson was cast. The meat of the story is the action and interaction of family members. Add this to plausible plot twists and you come up with a movie that had a unique view of the sacrifices they endured during WWII. This is not some cardboard war propaganda film.

I would say to me the most moving sections were, the outcome of the Miniver Rose, unexpected war casualty, and of course as results the final church scene.",1509753600,,663,4.434426229508197

3674085,5,B001KXZGOG,"By far one of the best war movies you will ever see. I love the WWII movies with John Wayne and others, but this shows you how it was to live in England during the war from the perspective of a mother. Don't worry there is plenty of action as they are directly touched by the war. This is a true classic. The cast is incredible, especially Greer Garson and Walter Pigeon. The directing is flawless, the camera work including actual scenes is excellent. I highly recommend it. A great movie to see as prequel before you see the BBC movie Dunkirk.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dunkirk/dp/B06ZZQ4QNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dunkirk</a>",1496966400,,681,5.495238095238095

3674162,4,B001KXZGOG,"The 1942 film shows how the life of an unassuming British housewife (and her family and village)  in rural England is touched by World War II. I enjoyed the look back into 1940's war-time rural England. The characters were interesting and very well developed. The plot is historically grounded by seminal events in spots to add reality to the screen play. I found it humorous what sensors would not allow back then; husband and wife sleeping in separate beds in the same bedroom. The film's end was poorly edited and could have been better written, as it abruptly concludes in a war-time morale-building theme. I found it a warm and interesting film, even while mawkish at times.",1456876800,,679,4.803418803418803

Greer Garson is both beautiful and capable as the English homemaker, while Walter Pidgeon plays her steady husband.

3674264,5,B001KXZGOG,"I love the family in this movie. The viewer gets to know and care for the Minivers and the movie conveyed a sense of what life was like in England both before and then during the War. The scene in the bomb shelter, when mom is knitting, dad is reading a book, and the children are sleeping safely, and then you hear the bombs start falling- harrowing to watch. As Americans, we never experienced that terror the way families in England and Europe did so this was an important film at the time because it showed Americans what everyday families in England were experiencing during the Blitz. I also liked that the film focused on the mother in the story as the source of the family's strength. And Greer Garson?

When I described the rescue of the British and French armies by the volunteer owners of England's small boats from the beach at Dunkirk, his mouth fell open. Then he said ""Wow!""

3674315,5,B001KXZGOG,"An American In Paris
When Gertrude Stein told Hemingway ""You're all a lost generation,"" the bloom came off the rose and expatriate status lost its cache among Americans living in Paris.  It was a phenomenon, but one that had expired by the time this film was made in 1951.  Still, for a new generation of viewers, the main premise of this film is still intact.  That seems to be what the film wants: to be accepted for what it is: a love story.

Gene Kelly had a boatload of experience in film and on stage prior to his pairing with Leslie Caron in An American in Paris.  He plays an artist low on cash but high on principle; there are two scenes where he takes up arms, first a sidewalk encounter with a college student on a point over art theory, second with art patron Milo Roberts (Nina Fochs) who wants more than his paintings.  Kelly is so adamant in both instances that the movie becomes his film, although he gets lots of help and advice from his friends, one of whom, the classical pianist Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) takes a flight of fancy that forms the comic high point of the picture.  But Kelly's main interest, then obsession, leads him to Leslie Caron and a well choreographed episode of imaginative longing, a lush panorama of art, Gershwin music and ballet that secured Kelly's reputation for helping  broaden ballet's appeal to large audiences.  The film leaves no doubt that Gene Kelly could carry a motion picture.  He followed it up a year later with another great performance in Singin' In The Rain.

Gigi
Gigi is a musical spectacular that overlays a thorny family issue: discreet infidelity -  a touchy subject when this film was made in 1958, a sore point between couples today.  Lavish and colorful costumes helped producer Arthur Freed sell this underlying theme to the guardians of the Hollywood Production Code.  Placing the action of the movie in the 19th century instead of the 20th is a timing device helping to put some distance between the filmed era and the contemporary scene.  This distance allows the film to deftly suggest the issue it chronicled was part of a bygone age, even though we know it isn't.

Maurice Chevalier adds charm and sophistication with his presence, not to mention a great singing voice, and yet another means of softening the film's main theme of preparing young girls to be mistresses.  Gigi herself is in training for such a role under the tutelage of Madam Alvarez (Hermione Gingold).

Louis Jourdan as Gaston stands in contrast to the whole notion of marital deceit and is  repelled by the social system supporting it.  An ardent proponent of plain speaking, Gaston is the polar opposite of the gossipers at Maxim's restaurant (if you can't actually go to Maxim's, you can visit it vicariously in this film).  Leslie Caron is wonderful as Gigi, her transformation from nave adolescent to the radiantly confident woman she becomes is amazing to watch - the producers no doubt also intend it as a triumph of enlightened virtue over essentially corrupt social mores.  Vincent Minnelli supplies impeccable taste to his direction, Joseph Ruttenberg's camera work translates vibrantly on the screen in this restoration.

Mrs. Miniver
Seventy years ago, Winston Churchill remarked that Mrs. Miniver was England's greatest propaganda tool of World War II.  He alluded, no doubt, to the struggle to enlist the United States on England's side for the war, something that would have happened even without the aid of Mrs. Miniver.  Enough time has passed to allow this film to be evaluated on artistic rather than political grounds; by the same token, we can view Churchill's remark as a political judgment, not an artistic one.

Artistically, the film's ability to surprise is potent.  The wartime theme prepares us for tragedy, if not for those who receive it.  Another surprise is its treatment of children as human beings in their own right, not extensions of parental authority.  Greer Garson augments this; she doesn't interrupt, censor or admonish them for the things they say, and they say a lot.  Once the air raids begin, parents and children unite to fend off the terror of night bombing and despite their stoicism, the parents themselves become children.

The outcome of Mrs. Miniver's encounter with a wounded German paratrooper seems unpredictable, not prescripted.  The film could go in any number of directions.  In one event where we do know the outcome, the sweep and panorama of boats on the English riverside will be impressive even to those who have never heard of Dunkirk.  In sum, the distance from the film's events is such that new viewers can form their own opinions, which may have nothing to do with propaganda.

Casablanca
Perhaps the labeling on this package should read: Best Picture Ever Winner because that's what Casablanca is: The Best Picture Ever.

Some critics of this picture usually point to its technical flaws, a view that ignores the film's ability to elicit strong emotions from an audience.  In accompanying commentary, much is made about the airplane swooping into Casablanca's opening sequence - its a ""model airplane"" we're told, as though the picture might have been better with John Wayne swooping onto the landing field in a Grumman Hellcat.  Suspension of disbelief is such that the plane could be a balsawood glider (it probably was) and I wouldn't care; it's Bogart's reaction to the aircraft I'm cueing on.  Anything short of Rodan landing would be satisfactory.  Some say Bogart was off cue - later on, when Bogart tongue lashes Ingrid Bergeman, a bottle of bourbon squarely in the middle of the table between the two actors, it should be apparent it's the bourbon talking, not Bogie.

Casablanca unleashed a torrent of phrases into the popular culture, a testament to its grip on public imagination.  Its sustained emotional appeal is the reason the film permanently enthrals audiences.",1308268800,,5895,4.901209677419355

3674327,5,B001KXZGOG,"An unforgettable slice of wartime life in England, MRS. MINIVER (based on Jan Struther's novel) stars Greer Garson in the role she was born to play, one which earned her an Academy Award in 1942. The story opens in the last peaceful summer of 1939. We meet the lovely Kay Miniver as she frets over buying a particularly expensive but beautiful hat. It is a lovely, carefree scene which sets up the idyllic existence of Kay and her family in the close-knit village of Belham, a world which literally disappears when World War II breaks out. Kay, her husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), eldest son Vin (Richard Ney) and his beautiful young bride Carol (Teresa Wright) become the central characters in a saga which scales the highs and lows of life lived in the worst possible circumstances, but the Miniver clan muddle through with strength, will and self-respect.

There are many memorable scenes in the film: Kay reading ""Alice in Wonderland"" to the two younger children whilst in the bomb shelter; Clem leaving for the shores of Dunkirk on his rickety fishing boat; kindly station master Mr. Ballard (Henry Travers) growing a rose in honour of Kay; and the amazing sequence where Kay herself confronts a downed Nazi fighter-pilot in her kitchen.

MRS. MINIVER remains to this day a moving account of wartime life in England. It's purpose during the war was to boost morale, and that it did. Today, MRS. MINIVER is still regarded with affection and love. May it always be.",1297468800,,1467,4.817460317460317

In an age when there were no VCRs, much less DVDs, a film came your way, you saw it and from then on they were memories.  These films were considered classics then and seeing them again I would say that they stand up well against current stuff.  Different acting style, true, but the dramatic impact and the story lines are as good as any.  It is refreshing to see the dancing in American... and Gigi.  Is today's stuff really more energetic?  The old days were so much more graceful - tell me about Ginger Rodgers and Fred Astair.  The great relief?

3674353,4,B001KXZGOG,"This is one of the first of what is planned to be 27 sets of four films each from Warner Home Video. They are cheap bare-bones releases of classic movies sold at a discount to introduce classic film to the masses. That is a good idea, and for that I salute Warner Home Video. The following are the contents of this set -

Mrs. Miniver (1942) - This is a good film, and it has great acting, but it is one of those films that probably won because of the times. It depicts how the British coped while under seige during World War II as experienced by one British family headed by Mrs. Miniver.

Casablanca (1943) - This one probably won because of the wartime theme, but it is a great piece of moviemaking that just gets better with time. The chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart just oozes off the screen. It's more what's not said than what is in this film. The fact that Bogart didn't win best actor was one of the great injustices of all time.

An American in Paris (1951) - Of course the point of this film not the plot, it is Gene Kelly's dancing, which is fabulous as always. It inspired the quickly thrown together and even more popular ""Singin In the Rain"".

Gigi (1958) - The academy award winner in the year of my birth just does not inspire today. There are a couple of good songs, but not many. Plus the screenplay is antiquated and outright campy by today's standards.

Casablance is the finest Best Picture winner in the Warner Home Video archives. However, I think a better selection to round out the three of the total four films would have been Gone With the Wind (1939), Ben-Hur (1959), and My Fair Lady (1964). Also realize that Casablanca, Gigi, and American in Paris have recent deluxe releases, if you are interested in extra features.",1226534400,,1771,4.453703703703703
3674354,5,B001KXZGOG,"Mrs. Miniver is Greer Garson at her best. This wartime story tells of a family during the bombings of England. Every member is affected-either by going off to war itself ,or volunteering one's services to the war effort. Mrs. Miniver has some prize winning roses,and the effort made by everyone in the community to lead normal everyday lives is apparent by having a rose judging contest. Although enemy planes are flying and dropping bombs dangerously close,it is a clear case of what people would do to lead normal lives after their world has been turn upside down.
 Greer Garson won an oscar for her role as a strong woman trying to keep her family intact inspite the war and the world around them falling apart. Walter Piegeon plays her husband as he does in all Greer's movies,the chemistry bewteen these two actors is something to be marveled. It is rumored that Greer and Walter had an on-again -off-again relationship in real life;for many years. If you never seen a Greer Garson movie,this is the one to start with .  It has all the elements that made these type of movies very popular back then. It has suspence{the Germans dropping bombs and opening fire on them}major drama ,and some comedy in certain scenes. Letting the viewer know like in real life at times you might just be able to laugh literaly in the face of danger. After the war,MGM didn't know what to do with Greer,since strong women roles weren't needed as much-and decide to star her in a comedy called ""Julia Misbehaves"". Greer manages to land on her feet in this movie,and continued to have a successful career after the war.
 My only complaint is that they don't have a boxed set of all her movies;and not all of them are on dvd. ""That Forsythe Woman""made later in her career with Errol Flynn(his comeback at this point),""Valley of Decision"" with Gregory Peck. Mrs. Parkington-Greer ages 60 years in that one -are just some examples of films that need to be on dvd. Check out ""Pride and Prudejuice"" along with ""Random Harvest"". A real dramatic tearjerker staring Ronald Coleman. These movies are on dvd, along with ""Goodbye Mr. Chips""staring Robert Donat and ""Madame Currie"". I would suggest to anyone to buy this movie (Mrs. Miniver)to see great acting being played out in a great story to boot.

3674356,5,B001KXZGOG,"I find World War II movies about the home front more interesting than actual battle scene flicks. More people can relate to the experience than the small percentage of soldiers that actually saw combat.
 There are some really fine movies such as ""Since You Went Away"", ""Tender Comrade"" & the essential ""Best Years of Our Life"", actually made in 1946. Mrs Miniver from 1942 was one of the first of these movies & perhaps just a little better. It takes place in England as the war is about to begin  portrays Dunkirk & the blitz that followed. It was aimed smack dab at American public opinion.
Despite this manipulation, it is an outstanding movie worthy of all the awards it received. Remember, at this time the outcome of the war was still in doubt (we were losing).
  Greer Garson is absolutely wonderful as the idealized wife, mother & woman in those dark days during the Battle of Britian when England stood alone. Walter Pidgeon is her amiable husband, Richard Ney her grown-up son who joins the RAF. He falls in love with Theresa Wright, the typical girl-next-door type. There are her little children & Henry Travers (remember him?) for humor. Their well ordered life is torn apart, along with their beautiful home when it is bombed. Mrs. Miniver & the whole family are so brave, British, stiff upper lip & all that. You know some tragedy must befall them. When it does it is a bit of a surprise.",1128470400,,1402,4.618473895582329

As a big fan of Greer Garson, I must comment on Jane Bedinger's review in which she claimed that Ms. Garson was having an ""affair"" with the actor who played her son.  Ms. Garson fell in love with and married Richard Ney about a year after the movie was made.  I don't see how Ms. Bedinger could consider this an ""affair"".",1119484800,,492,4.49438202247191
3674368,5,B001KXZGOG,"When I watch this film, I feel like I am in Britain during those dramatic months when the RAF was fighting daily to ward off the brain-washed German barbarians, and the world was hanging by a thread. (Helmut Dantin shouts in German like Hitler at one point: ""We will destroy everything!"")Though it won the Academy Award in 1942, it was in fact made in 1941, and it is about events in 1939-1940, when Britain stood alone, a never-to-be-forgetten moment in human history. People more objective than I will call it propaganda; I call it a dramatic portrayal of the essence of a historial moment.

Willie Wilder manages to create on a Hollywood studio lot the atmosphere of village in Southern England (near Portsmouth perhaps). The flower show scene is superbly done: a wonderful madrigal choir sings a classical English folk song. It is a very English moment. Wilder's got the train (as they were then) right and the station, as well as the Enlish church with its private pews for the gentry. He even manages to get English accents out of everyone except Walter Pidgeon. Ney who plays Miniver's son (in real life about to marry his mother) and little Christopher Severn, her other son, are straight up and down Americans, but they pull off the accent perfectly. Dame May Whittey gives the sense of quality and breeding that was then a part of English character.  Wilder touches affectionately upon English class obsessions, their former love of and excellence at gardening, the cockiness and the fashionable pseudo-radicalism of young Oxbridge graduates, the understated physical bravery of the English people. It's a brilliant job of director and a fabulous piece of revenge on Wilder's part for Hitler's antisemitism, of which he was a victim.

Mrs. Miniver is more than a film. It is part of history. It communicates the indominable spirit of the English people. Ney, who plays Miniver's son, is a subtle combination of youth and very purposeful strength. He giggles and cackles like a boy in front of his parents and siblings, but when he gets the girl alone he knows what he wants, and you recognize that he is very much a man. You realize also that in a Spitfire dogfight with the Germans over England, he will win. There are many angles to this film that warrant watching it a number of times.

""Mrs Miniver"" did a lot to bring world opinion around to Britain's side, and in that, it is unique in Hollywood history as film of historical importane.",1115424000,,2452,4.789598108747045
3674369,4,B001KXZGOG,"""Mrs. Miniver"" is regarded as a classic WW2 homefront movie. In this case the setting is a comfortable prim and proper English town in the Summer of 1939. When WW2 breaks out, the ""good and decent"" townspeople must put aside their stuff class distinctions and pull together against the common enemy, Nazi Germany. The Battle of Britain, the retreat from Dunkirk and eponymous wartime romances/ heartbreak are aptly used as background. The female leads carry the picture. In fact Greer Garson and Teresa Wright won Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress Oscars. Another cast member, Dame May Whitty was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress and male lead, Walter Pidgeon, was nominated for Best Actor. MM also won Best Movie honors and Director William Wyler also was given a statuette. MMs timing was fortuitous! Work began just before the attack Pearl Harbor and wrapped in the Spring of 1942 just as this country needed propaganda/soap operas supporting the Big One. One can appreciate the rush to Oscars but that too has its own story: Lost in all the awards was Ms. Garson's stunning role alongside Ronald Colman in ""Random Harvest"". Almost lost was Ms. Wright's work as Lou Gehrig's wife in ""Pride of the Yankees"" for which she and Gary Cooper were nominated for Oscars. MM has two main weak points: One is that the 133 minute run time is plainly too long. Some of those flower-growing contests should have been shortened. Other scenes unfold far too leisurely. The second weak point is that unlike other propaganda flicks (like ""Casablanca""), MM has not aged gracefully. It now appears dowdy and dated. There are definite strong points: The small town setting is one. The little vignettes are outstanding such as when the maid Gladys learns her boyfriend's getting drafted! There is also the best-trained movie cat in history. (This review is passing over without comment those ""famous"" scenes of the captured German pilot and the minister's closing speech/sermon). In the last analysis, MM will always have those two strong Garson and Wright performances which will preserve it as worthwhile viewing even today. MM is recommended for serious movie viewers.",1080691200,,2170,5.064245810055866
3674370,5,B001KXZGOG,"I've seen this film several times now, and despite knowing what occurs, the beauty never wears off.
The film is aesthetically lovely, thanks to William Wyler's low key yet attentive and detailed style. The characters act naturally, something oft times missing in older films that lean to be more stylized. The acting is incredible in this film, and something many a modern film would do well to copy. Greer Garson is the portrait of strength, beauty, and dignity as Mrs. Miniver in a brilliantly played role. Yet it's the substance that stays with you. The film is telling a story about people and a time in history, and it's simple because it allows itself to be. It flows like real life, the trivial, the simple, the small moments, the enormous and life shattering. It taps into the real emotions people feel, and not big ""war movie"" emotions, but the joy of greeting a child upon return, of having a flower named after you and winning an award, of happiness and humor, of exhaustion, fear, pain, and grief. The film gently brings us into another life and lets us reside there. While there, we begin to love the Minivers and those that they love.
At one point in the movie, the family is in a bomb shelter and Mr. and Mrs. Miniver are talking. Mr. Miniver picks up ""Alice in Wonderland"" and begins to recite a passage about the joys of childhood, a summer past, and the simple pleasures in life. Mrs. Miniver finishes the passage, and Mr. Miniver (Walter Pidgeon) mentions that he wonders if Lewis Carrol ever thought that his story would be so beloved decades later. I found that interesting, because after all these years and viewings, it's the characters and their palpable experiences and emotions, the strength and courage they show, and the simplicity of the film in allowing us to see it plainly and feel it too, because it's a story of the human experience we can all relate with that isn't limited to the battleground, that do and will keep this movie everlasting, and an homage to the human spirit.",1043452800,,2010,4.664788732394366
3674371,5,B001KXZGOG,"It is such a disappointment to not be able to obtain the DVD edition of Mrs. Miniver yet.  This is a film I shared with my granddaughter several years ago and is a warm memory for her.
It was my pleasure and honor to meet Greer Garson at the end of her life at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.  It was her birthday and our department was responsible for the setting up of the room and the refreshments.  I was to uncork the champagne.  At 5:30pm, Mrs. Fogelson (her married name) was wheeled into the room, absolutely radiant at the age of 92, wearing a brocade gown that matched the beauty of her green eyes.  The celebration was short, in keeping with her frail condition, but she was such a grand lady, just like her presentation of Mrs. Miniver.  Frail, yet regal.  Queenlike, yet personable.
After her party, I took flowers to her room.  She had already been tucked back into bed, but still so pretty, though tired.  I went to her bed and she held out her hand to me.  She held my hand with both of hers, and I felt as though I was the most important person she had ever met.
Evertime I watch the movie, Mrs. Miniver, I am transported back to that day by her bed after her birthday.  She lived only two more years, but everyone remembered her with such love and respect.  I treasure having been given the very last glossy of her portfolio.
Rest in peace, beloved Mrs. Miniver.",1039996800,,1381,4.3515625
3674372,5,B001KXZGOG,"It's still possible for a sentimental person to enjoy this saga of fortitude in the face of war if only for its bravery and romance and wholesomeness; but at the time it came out, even the hard of heart found it irresistible, for it is sheer, shameless, and superb wartime propaganda about an English family during the infamous Blitz.  As such, it brought the war home, especially to Americans just entering it and just beginning to realise how vulnerable everyone was to the threat of rapacious evil.  Greer Garson was thereafter forever identified with the heroine she portrayed so perfectly - brave, courteous, resourceful, controlled, and utterly noble.  She may seem a bit over the top to be jaded, modern audiences, but moments of crisis have always been known to bring into sharper relief latent personality traits which promp one to ""rise to the occasion"".  In this respect, Garson epitomises the vast majority of hardworking, long-suffering English housewives whose patriotism and deep determination became a palatable defense in the bitter struggle against Nazi Germany.  Her inner strength inspires others to tap their own secret depths.",1035936000,,1148,5.183783783783784
3674373,5,B001KXZGOG,"When MRS. MINIVER was released in 1942, England and Germany had been at war for nearly three years and the British armed forces were no lock to win.  The United States had been openly aiding England with war materials, but it had been only a few months before that America became directly involved after Pearl Harbor.  Hollywood knew that it would take many months before American aid could tip the scales in England's favor, and MRS. MINIVER was filmed to fill this gap by suggesting that our British allies were getting along well enough for us not to worry.  The movie was successful beyond Hollywood's wildest expectation, and this success was not measured only in the seven Academy Awards won (best picture, best director (William Wylie), best actress (Greer Garson) among others, the film galvanized Americans to see a war that was still abstract for most and portray it on a personal level.
  Greer Garson plays Kay Miniver, the upper middle-class wife of Mr. Miniver (Walter Pidgeon)in the early days of the war.  Kay Miniver, though pictured as the stereotypical English woman chock full of optimism, courage, and resourcefullness, is symbolically seen as more American than British.  When she hears about the outbreak of hostilities in 1939, the war seems rather a detached affair for her: life goes on for her and her family in a rather unruffled way.  Slowly, the war becomes increasingly personal.  She must alter her daily habits of consumption.  Her son volunteers for the RAF.  Her husband sails to Dunkirk to rescue the trapped British Army.  Ultimately, she even physically takes part in the war by capturing a downed Luftwaffe pilot.  As Kay Miniver morphs from passive supporter to active participant, the audience does too.  The subtle psychological switch is accomplished through the believable interaction of the cast, a result that allows their personal lives to evolve in a manner similar to Mrs. Miniver's.  Her son (Richard Ney) falls in love with Carol (Theresa Wright), which in turn allows the audience to empathise with Mrs. Miniver over fears for her son when he flies in combat.  Carol is a fully fleshed character whose own life later takes on tearful and tragic overtones that serve to remind the audience that the price of freedom can never be paid in abstract coin, but only in the deeply personal coin that counts.
  Much of the power of this movie resides in individual scenes that are stark reminders of the nobility of the Allied cause.  Characters in MRS. MINIVER tend to lecture each other rather than engage in spontaneous conversation, but these set speeches are not necessarily a bad thing.  Their measured tones simply reinforce the message that England is America's ally.  There are two scenes of speeches that resonate even today.  The first involves a German pilot (Helmut Dantine) who has parachuted onto Mrs. Miniver's garden, where he holds her captive.  Even though he has no legitimate chance to escape, he nevertheless takes advantage of the moment to warn her and the audience that the devastation that had fallen on Europe and Britain was but the precursor to a much more lethal destruction soon to follow.  Dantine's voice is full of a slightly hysterical smugness that must have grated on the audience of 1942.  The second scene is the famous view of the bombed out church that closes the movie.  The vicar (Henry Travers) exhorts the congregation in tones and words that amplify the theme that tragic acceptance of personal loss is the brutal necessity to achieve victory.  As he speaks, the camera lingers over empty chairs that had contained living parishioners, many of whom were women and choirboys.  God is clearly on the Allied side.  MRS. MINIVER achieved its purpose of uniting the allies in a holy war against Nazism.  Not many 'message' movies retain their intrinsic entertainment value decades after the message has become an historical footnote, but MRS. MINIVER is such a rare film.  It makes you care about that message even when you know you are being manipulated.",1028332800,,4040,4.958395245170877
3674374,5,B001KXZGOG,"I was seven in 1942, but TIME, LIFE, radio reports, and weekly movie news reels made the war real for me. So did MRS. MINIVER. By this time my dad, a PAA captain, was with the Allied Transport Command, ferrying military equipment to India. MRS. MINIVER affected me for several reasons. Mrs. Garson's performance was such that her character became a living person to me. Also, at this time my family had befriended three young Englishmen and one Scot who were learning to fly in the USAAC program at the U of Miami. They were frequent guests in our home and accompanied us on a vacation to Daytona Beach. Their and Ms. Garson's accents expressed for me the British resolve to keep on fighting and to win. I saw MRS. MINIVER with my extended family of adults and was moved by their tears. In 1944 my father flew a B-29 mission to Tokyo from which he did not return. The thought of the Minivers and the enormous sacrifices of the English gave me some consolation. I still think of the movie and have alluded to it in a story of mine to develop a character.",1024963200,,1053,4.4051282051282055
3674375,5,B001KXZGOG,"This film highlights the resilient nature of the British in the face of adversity.  The movie begins before the war with the typical middle-class family.  You learn their joys and their everyday concerns.  Then, the message comes to let them know that war, WWII, has started.
Greer Garson plays Mrs. Miniver who is at the center of the story.  Her oldest son has enlisted as a pilot and serves to defend England in the Battle of Britain.  Her husband works with a civil defense unit and helps to evacuate soldiers at Dunkirk.  Through all this, you see her continue life, as hard as it is, with a positive attitude and a stiff upper-lip.

There are many notable moments in this film for me. I found it very moving when the Minivers were being bombed that they kept reading ""Alice in Wonderland"" to keep from worrying. Upon seeing their house partially destroyed they focus on what is still standing.
The best point was the ending where the Reverend speaks of this being a war for all, not just soldiers. This speach is so timely now that I am surprised that some politician hasn't tried to use it!",1014508800,,722,4.43609022556391
3674388,5,B001KXZGOG,"A must-see movie about courage, love, family, country.  Is it reality?  Not a bit.  Is it true?  Absolutely.  Reality is that Greer Garson was having an affair with the actor who plays her son in the movie.  Truth: hundreds and thousands of people did respond to the challenges of wartime with the grace and honor portrayed here. The movie is about how ordinary and good people, a middle-class English family, hold on to what's important in life even when danger and tragedy strikes.
It's a pleasure to see the era's finest, handsomest actors demonstrating how we all hope we'd behave if we were tested by war.  Imagine, a movie that lets us see the fun and intimacy of marriage, the passion of family, the patriotism that comes from an honest appreciation of a culture's advantages without pretending to hide for a minute from its faults.
If this is a tear-jerker, it's because some things are worth tears.
Oh Hollywood, if you would only give us less reality and more truth!",1008460800,,976,4.705882352941177
3674389,3,B001KXZGOG,"I was very disappointed when I finally saw the much lauded ""Mrs. Miniver"". Greer Garson has no growth to her character at all--compare her with Claudette Colbert's mother in ""Since You Went Away"", where, after criticizing herself, a housewife realizes she has to pitch in personally to help the war effort along. Mrs. Miniver has it all together, all the time--never any insight into things.
In addition to the smug attitude of Mrs. Miniver herself, I thought too many plot elements were all thrown into one movie. The most amazing thing that occurs to Mrs. Miniver is when she has to keep a downed Nazi pilot at bay in her own kitchen. Now, that's just ONE thing that happens in this movie. However, in my opinion, THAT's enough to make a movie about. Look at ""High Noon"", which concerns itself with one problem, not being able to raise a posse. That's enough of a problem without the dam bursting or something else. So ""Mrs. Miniver"" would have been a remarkable film if it were about a British woman, clad only in her flowing robe, very vulnerable, having to match wits with a menacing Nazi pilot. Two character showdown symbolizing the Hun threat against hearth and home. But no, while she was having this brief encounter, Mr. Miniver was engaged in rescuing the army from Dunkirk in his little pleasure boat, and made it home in time for supper. Frankly, I thought these were trivializations of wartime, not glamorizations.
Of course, I was not alive at the time of the war, and I have often heard it said that this film was a great morale boost for the beleagured Brits. And so it may have been, in its day. But for a peacetime viewer such as myself, the movie just didn't inspire me. Again, I don't think it the equal of ""Since You Went Away"". View both and decide for yourself.",997228800,,1785,4.58125
3674390,5,B001KXZGOG,"The most important picture of World War II was an intensely moving drama about a middle class British family and its strong matriarch standing up against the tragedies and terrors of the onset of World War II. The movie was ""Mrs. Miniver"".
""Mrs. Miniver"" remains today one of the most powerful and compelling films ever made about the hardships of war even with the lack of a single battle scene. Like ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Mrs. Miniver""'s greatness lies in its revealing look of the individuals affected by a war. Making the film an even greater emotional experience is the fact that this film was made just at the time it revolves around, during the onset of WWII, when the outcome of the war was still uncertain and the future of the world was hanging in the balance.
In the title role of the film, Greer Garson is radiant, willful, warm and determined in the role of Kay Miniver, a British housewife who must keep her head on the homefront with her two young children while her husband (Walter Pidgeon) and son (Richard Ney) defend their country at the onset of World War II. Through her faith, her intelligence, and her love, Kay manages to hold her family together even as England collapses under the powerful effects of an unstoppable war. The picture's ending on a strong note of hope is that lingering optimisim which was the hope of audiences during WWII... that one day, there would be peace.
Garson won an Academy Award for her brilliant portrayal, and rightly so, for she invests her scenes with a genuine determination and will: In one scene, she holds a German soldier at bay with a gun in her kitchen as her children sleep upstairs. In another scene, she reads ""Alice in Wonderland"" to her children in a bomb shelter as bombs begin to fall over them. In still another scene, Garson drives with her daughter-in-law (Teresa Wright, whose charming portrayal earned her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) through a countryside engaged in sky battle.
William Wyler's brilliant direction sears through the film and its cast, earning him an Oscar for Best Director, and for the film itself, Best Picture of 1942.
Still powerful after half a century, ""Mrs. Miniver"" is a brilliant testament to the soldiers who lost their lives on the battleground- and on the homefront- in defense of their country. Wartime audiences were given a great boost of morale in this movie, and that morale shines through in this indescribably great film classic.",978393600,,2452,4.771764705882353

I found this movie a little unbelievable  for a couple of reasons. One, while a distant village is being bombed off  the map, Father (Walter Pidgeon) makes a lighthearted comment about the  bright lights of the exploding bombs in the distance. Those bright lights  signaled the end of hundreds (thousands) of lives of his fellow Brits. I  can't believe anyone in a war zone would be so cavalier.
The movie does  have many high points and is a very interesting drama. The relationships  between the characters is interesting and the acting is all done very well.  I love old movies but this one didn't hit me. It's certainly worth watching  a time or two, but I wouldn't go out and buy it for my own collection.

Example: It looks as pencil drawings of the city of  London, boats that are simply animated cartoons, and the mansion of Miniver  Family seems as a postal card stamp. To recapitulate, the plot was simple,  appealing to a superficial nationalism, without deep roots of convictions.  Why are two women alone in the middle of a battle?  Where was Mr. Miniver?  What was he doing, he left these two women in this dangerous moment?  Else, the rose contest was very ""kinder garden"" like activity.  In addition, the man of Mrs. Miniver rose seems fool in its acting manners.  To recapitulate, it was a family album story.",956793600,,770,4.595588235294118
3674406,5,B001KXZGOG,"Whenever I saw that MRS. MINIVER would be on t.v., either late at night or during the day, I always made sure that I would be able to watch it, and each and every time that I saw this movie, it always evoked the same  emotions happiness, saddness and fondness for this good family, the  Minivers.
It was an era when the life in the south of England was still  gentle, simple but gracious.  This middle-class family the Minivers enjoyed  all the comforts of life while not being totally materialistic.  They had  good family values of caring, and sharing for one another.  This black and  white movie shows their beautiful English home with the flowers in full  bloom against the backdrop of the south of England countryside.
Teresa  Wright played a wonderful role as Carol Belding, the young, charming and  unassuming aristocratic woman who fell in love with Vincent Miniver.  Greer  Garson was absolutely lovely as Kay Miniver, and she and Walter and Pidgeon  were simply made for each other as Mr. and Mrs. Miniver.  This story does  full justice to the British people in their enjoyment in the simple ways of  life, but their ability to accept life's greatest challenge of the thin  line between life and death with the ""stiff upper lip"" and  courageously get on with their lives.
A heart rending part is with the  good hearted station master, and his creation of the Miniver Rose.
Wow!  I could keep going on making favorable comments about the best film of all  times.  If I ever get down in the dumps about anything, I can always watch  this movie, now being an owner of it, and it can serve as an inspiration  for all of us that the Minivers are representative of people who coped with  hardships.",953596800,,1704,4.6120401337792645

It is so great because the war had just started when they made so they really  didn't know what was going to happen.",944179200,,261,3.7777777777777777
3674408,4,B001KXZGOG,"MRS. MINIVER is a very poignant and touching film experience filled with a great cast and a lasting message. Although it is not a landmark motion picture, it still provides a perception of the Second World War and how it  was like on the English side for a family having to split up and decide  their fates. The only problems are the fact that it feels like a soap opera  often dragging on for over two hours and that the Miniver family, although  portrayed by masterful actors, isn't as completely convincing as it should  have been. Quite watchable, but never works entirely.",943833600,,577,4.617647058823529
3674409,5,B001KXZGOG,"One of the most important films of World War II, Mrs. Miniver is the wonderful story of a middle-class English family during the German Blitz.  I'll admit that the film occasionally feels a bit forced, but that seems to  have been the point.  It's telling that director William Wyler battled with  studio head Louis B. Mayer to include a fascist-spouting Nazi pilot; once  Pearl Harbor was attacked, Mayer let Wyler have his way with the character.  Mrs. Miniver provided a great deal of morale in the early war years, so  much so that Winston Churchill said the film was more helpful than a fleet  of destroyers.  The film's real power is derived from the wonderful  performance of Greer Garson in the title role; the film established her as  THE leading lady of the 1940s and it's easy to see why.  She's radiant  here, giving a controlled, yet spirited performance (oddly, she didn't want  the role, and took it only when Norma Shearer passed it up).  She won a  richly deserved Oscar for it, though she's gone down in history for having  given a one-hour acceptance speech--in reality, it was only 5 minutes, much  shorter than some we have to endure today.",912470400,,1161,4.691542288557214
