Series 10 of New Tricks saw a sea change in this very successful and long running show which debuted as long ago as 2003 and has now run to 87 episodes. By the end of the series the only member of the original team still in UCOS was Jerry Standing (Dennis Waterman). Following the departure of Jack Halford (James Bolam) at the beginning of the last series, it was time to bid a fond farewell to both Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong) and DS Sandra Pulman (Amanda Redman), Brian fairly early on in the series and Sandra in Episode 8.

The cases this time round were quite varied. We start off with a two part story set in Gibralter, which is unusual for New Tricks which has rarely strayed far from its London home in the past. This was a puzzling cold case in which two killings separated by sixteen years were apparently linked. Brian had been getting himself into trouble and there are signs that his days in UCOS were numbered. The change of scenery seemed to suit the team who seemed to excel with the more exotic surroundings. However, the rest of the episodes were back in London, and I would say the stories were a lot more interesting and coherent than, perhaps those in Series 9 when apparently the cast took it on themselves to rewrite some of the scripts!

So how did the new boys and girl get on? Steve McAndrew (Denis Lawson), Jack Halford's replacement, seems to have really settled in with the team now and appears comfortable in the role. However, I was particularly impressed with Dan Griffin, Brian's replacement, played by Nicholas Lyndhurst who is probably best known for his role in Only Fools and Horses. From his appearance in Episode 5, when the team are investigating a murder case from 1980's Soho, he seemed to be a natural for UCOS. This was an inspired piece of casting. The final new boy (or rather girl) was Detective Chief Inspector Sasha Miller played by Tamzin Outhwaite who only had two episodes to make an impact, which she certainly did on the team who were initially very suspicious about this change. However, in many ways she seems like a younger version of Sandra Pulman and even sounds very similar so this is, perhaps, not such a dramatic change.

I would agree with those who have said that it would be good to have more of the personal lives of the participants as there was in earlier series. However, I would say the signs in this respect are good with glimpses of Steve McAndrew's and Dan Griffin's personal life, quite a lot on Brian Lane in the earlier episodes and some pretty dramatic personal developments for Sasha Miller from the word go. Lets hope to see more of this aspect in the future.

So overall this was a good solid series of 10 episodes which will please most viewers. It is not certain where we go from here, and although a new team is in place alongside Jerry Standing, I have not heard that an eleventh series has been announced yet. When it became clear that most of the original actors were leaving I did wonder what the future would hold. However, after this series I see no reason why the show should not continue along the same lines with the new cast, particularly given that the viewing figures for this season remained very strong. It will certainly be different and with the established players leaving it is the end of an era, but there is no reason why the new format should not be equally entertaining.",1384300800,5,3634,4.505311077389985
