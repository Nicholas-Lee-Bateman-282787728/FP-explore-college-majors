2102801,5,B0002LE9HW,"I must say, I remember when this season first aired. I was hooked from the season 2 finale cliffhanger, waiting anxiously for ""Optimal Situation"". I even watched The Agenda 3 right before ""Optimal Situation"" aired. This season is pure gold, in continuation from season 1 and 2. What the true gem of this season set is are the two bonus features included on disc 2!

1. The cut scene of Primal restoring G1 Meg's spark back into his body, and

2. The full animatic, minus music, of Nemesis Part 2! This is the Director's cut of the episode, how Simon Furman originally intended it! Act 3 of the animatic truly shines; the extended footage and dialog truly make this a ""prime"" episode! Whenever I watch Season 3 on dvd, I stop right at the end of Act 2 on the ""aired"" version of Nemesis 2, go to the Animatic, and Channel Select right to Act 3!

Also, don't forget to buy the Beast Wars Omnibus! The ""Gathering"" and ""Ascending"" take place during this season and During/After Nemesis 2!",1322179200,,983,4.51123595505618

2102803,5,B0002LE9HW,"The final season of one of the best Transformers shows to date in my honest opinion.  While this season picks up after the big dramatic finale of Season 2, thinking if there would be a chance for the Maximals to be able to fix the damage that was done at the end of the previous season.  Although that damaged was fixed but at the same time the battle was far from over, the Predacons done whatever they could to try to get control of what is better known as the Autobot ship, the Ark.  While this season has seen a new comer come in along with two old friends, but coming back in a way that nobody had seen coming for whatever reason they thought they would be coming back.  Although that this season is 13 episodes just like Season 2, but just like Season 2, the writers didn't fail at delivering the best story telling that they could for the series and a lot of unexpected twists go on in this season.  Everything that you didn't think would happen, happen in this season along with the big series 2 part finale and bringing the Beast Wars/Generation 1 story line to a great end.  While I was hoping that Season 3 would at least be a little longer than 13 episodes long but I'm satisfied in what they were able to accomplish for the whole Beast Wars saga.  Overall I give this set 5 stars out of 5.",1280448000,,1302,4.225806451612903
2102804,5,B0002LE9HW,"This DVD set delivers.  The third season is the resolution of the various plot threads that made the first and second seasons so engrossing, and the appearance of the transmetal II versions of various characters makes it all the sweeter.

My only gripe is that several characters or ""upgrades"" appear within a few episodes of the end of the series, so they do not receive nearly the development that even season 2's new characters receive.  Given that character development is one of Beast Wars's strengths, this saddens me.

But, this set was still a delicious romp down memory lane :)",1272499200,,586,4.83

2102806,4,B0002LE9HW,"As a long time fan, I was not disappointed by season 3. While it left me wanting more, I can't say I felt gypped by the way it all played out. I missed the end of the series in broadcast, then watched Beast Machines religiously. As a writer, I would have taken the whole thing in a different direction-but as a fan of G1, I was amazed by the concept, and thrilled by the nods to us geeks. If I have one complaint, it's that the story arc ending the series wrapped up too quickly. However, season three delivers, and I watch it over and over. Not perfect, but if you liked the first two seasons, you'll only watch this and lament the fact that there wasn't a fourth.",1229904000,,665,4.162790697674419
2102807,5,B0002LE9HW,"The last season of Beast Wars (which then begins in Beast Machines)is just as good as the other two seasons. Though, personally I like season one the best. No particular reason, but just because it appeals to me.

2102808,4,B0002LE9HW,"After an amazing first season, a hard-hitting second season, one can only imagine the high expectations for the third season of Beast Wars. But in comparison to the previous episodes, season 3 is more a mish-mash of important plot episodes and side filler episodes. But don't think you're getting slighted in the least. Every episode affords further development of fun and interesting characters while slowly building to a season finale that resolves the Beast Wars once and for all.

Don't forget, the Covenant of Primus contains SPOILERS.

The Maximals are not in good odds with the Beast Wars, now pulling double-duty in protecting the fledgling human race and their Autobot ancestors still in stasis. Megatron has no qualms about attacking, and would like nothing more than to change history.

A few new characters are introduced, including one of my personal favorites, Depth Charge. A bot who breaks the do-gooding Maximal image, Depth Charge is on a revenge mission, and won't hesitate to tell Primal to stuff it when he has a job to do. One of the things Season 3 lacks is more Depth Charge.

Also, many recurring characters are given upgrades. Optimal Optimus Primal, Transmetal 2 Megatron, Cheetor and Black Arachnia, a TM2 clone of Dinobot, and another new and unfortunately over-looked character, Tigerhawk. A lot of these changes going on over the course of 13 episodes is a bit much, but one of the vices of many Transformers series is that they are venues to encourage toy sales.

Season 3 is still made of the same great animation and writing that has carried the first two seasons. Action, drama, humor, and good vs. evil are still played out on prehistoric Earth. The acting is still top notch, and what episodes you do get are full of everything you'd want in a series. You'll only be sad to see it all come to an end.",1218412800,,1837,4.800632911392405
2102809,5,B0002LE9HW,"The third, and final, season of Beast Wars picks up where the second season cliffhanger left off in dynamite fashion.  Optimus Primal and his team of Maximals find themselves in charge of safeguarding history as they try to stop Megatron and his Predacons from destroying the original Autobot Ark, and once again, Optimus gets a new body.  There were some changes aplenty in this season, including Megatron gaining a new dragon form, resurrecting Dinobot as his old evil self, and the arrival of Maximal lawman Depth Charge, who has a score to settle with the murderous Pred Rampage.  This season also saw the further development of the unlikely romance between Silverbolt and Black Arachnia, Cheetor gaining a new form, and a climactic showdown that not everyone from either side will walk away from.  Various in-jokes were abound in this season, as was the action ante which was considerably upped.  The series would later be relaunched as Beast Machines, which would continue the saga of Maximals and the Predacons on Cybertron, and sadly made one too many changes to the formula and wasn't nearly as enjoyable as Beast Wars.  All in all, the third and final season of Beast Wars is simply smashing, and definitely worth owning for Transformers and/or Beast Wars fans new and old.",1197676800,,1283,4.944186046511628

2102811,5,B0002LE9HW,"To all G1 fans who haven't given this show a chance:
This show is fantastic, especially the third season. I dare you to watch just a few episodes of season 2 and 3 and still call it junk. You can't. Despite being based on a toyline (G1 was also, by the way), this series has fabulous character development. It does not reinvent the Generation One Autobots and Decepticons. It is the story of their descendants, the Maximals and Predacons, and it ties back into Generation One without a flaw. All true Generation One fans should enjoy this series because it is a perfect sequel. Beast Wars even features cameos by G1 characters such as Starscream (S1,E21 ""Possession""), Ravage (S2,E11-13 ""The Agenda""), Optimus Prime (S2, E13 ""The Agenda Part 3""; S3,E1 ""Optimal Situation""), and the original (Decepticon) Megatron (S3, E10 ""Master Blaster""). The character development and plot points of Beast Wars are superior to those of Generation One. It hurts to say it, because I am an original G1 fan also, but it is true. If you still say that you don't like this series after you have watched it, you should ask yourself if it is the Transformers you love, or if it is your childhood memories you love more.",1188864000,,1198,4.70952380952381

It writes the final chapter in the beast wars...or does it?  Great action and stories.  This season introduces a couple of new characters, transmetal 2. I feel that it just ended abbruptly, with the middle episodes just being Kinda blah, but the beginning and end were good.  Check out Transformers: Beast Machines if you liked this series, especially this season...Beast machines is addictive to watch, and continues a fresh series with tie in to this one.

Overall it is a nice DVD set the only gripe I have s that the intros to my episodes are all messed up. The first 12 seconds or so have the opening beginning to the season two intro, and then mysteriously cuts to the rest of the third season intro. I, as a huge fan of the show find this rather annoying. Other than that I have no real complaints the show looks and sounds just as good as I remember it. A great show fun for the whole family. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the errors in the intro.",1154736000,,666,3.7985611510791366
2102820,5,B0002LE9HW,"If you are someone who has never watched any Beast Wars episodes and want to get an idea of what the series is about as a whole, please read my reviews for seasons #1 and #2.  If you're not feeling like doing that, let me just say that I think Beast Wars may have been the best Transformers series period and is great for old and new fans alike.

Season 3 is the final one of the series and arguably the most action packed.  There are only 13 episodes and all of them factor in heavily to the overall story.  Classic G1 characters appear, seemingly forgotten storylines from past seasons are revived and just about every loose end from the entire series is sewn up in near perfect fashion.

The finale is downright awesome and gives great closure to the series.  However, they did make a series after this one, called ""Beast Machines"" featuring some of the same characters that has a very different feel to it.

I have reviewed Beast Machines, also.

As one final note, if you have never seen a Beast Wars show, I'd advise picking up the seasons in order as they heavily build on each other.",1149379200,,1091,4.393034825870647

2102822,3,B0002LE9HW,"SO much potential after the first two amazing seasons but this one is hindered by cramming far too much in and way too many new characters and beast mode changes, as well as the love story seeming to take over the series. Still mahy strong episodes and superb animation. This story arc (no pun intended) could have run over another season. Good just too crammed in.",1146873600,,365,4.545454545454546
2102823,5,B0002LE9HW,"I loved watching the Beast Wars when I was a teenager and I was sad to see it end, even more so I was sad to even watch the series that followed it. Although season 3 isn't the best of the three, it still have some great plot lines, new characters, return of some old ones, and still for 2006 some great computer animation.

I have one problem with the boxset for Season 3 though. The packaging is a neat color, not one I prefer for the 3rd season though considering it was the season to introduce the TransMetal 2's, it would have been more inline if it was modeled after the toy packaging art. But anway when you look at the two discs it contains they have on disc 1 Rhinox in robot mode and on the second one Waspinator in robot mode, both are very grainy digital images. But why these two? And even more there is a picture of Beast Wars season 1 Cheetor from one of the very first episodes of the series. The little booklet that comes with the set has the same exact image from the season 2 box with the quantam surge. I can speculate why they used these images but to the buyer it seems like they just didn't care to do anything else and rushed this out and even though I now have all of the final 13 episodes I feel jaded as a fan.

If you've never seen the Beast Wars before I recommend this box set along with seasons 1 & 2, it was a very powerful show and one that I will always miss. It had great action, a great sense of humor, and indepth character and plot development for what Hasbro gave to Bob Forward and Larry Ditillo.",1142812800,,1536,4.099667774086379
2102824,5,B0002LE9HW,"My thoughts for this season are the same as for the second season of the Beast Wars:  A very in-depth, dramatic, intense, suspenseful plot that really captures transformers fans.

I'm glad I bought all the seasons, I certainly recommend getting the previous ones before this one if you are interested.

A small warning, however:  I bought the DVD's for the show and the show only.  I don't care for extra features or how the box looks, as long as it's in good condition.  This may upset some people who are interested in the DVD set because extra features may mean a lot.  Just as a warning, this season is the only one without special features, so hopefully that doesn't convince you not to get this set because it's awesome.",1142640000,,726,4.5813953488372094

I can't wait until beast machines for the continuation of this story when they take Megatron back to Cybertron for his trial.

I love the Beast Wars.  The characters portrayed aren't two dimensional.  Finally, There is a plot to a Transformers story other than Autobot vs Decepticon kill..kill come back to life.",1120953600,,560,4.904255319148936
2102827,5,B0002LE9HW,"Not sure what most people buy DVDs for, but for me it is definitely NOT the packaging, NOT the graphics on the Disk, and NOT the *lack* of *special* features.

The actual content on this set is for transformer fans' dreams. This is it, folks: the true end to the Beast Wars saga. And boy does it go out with a bang. No spoilers here, but fans of the original Transformers series and the movie will find lots of enjoyment, especially with the last intricately plotted 2 part series finale. Villainy. Death. Heroism. Giant robot duels. Sacrifice. This is what makes Transformers, and it is all here.

The third season showed incredible production value with lots of special effects, huge set pieces, gigantic spaceships, pivotal epic moments, the best writing and the best direction - all of which are amplified from previous seasons.

Seasons 1 and 2 were excellent, but Season 3 is where it ends dramatically.

With the maximal base destroyed they have to protect the arc. This season also introduces a few new characters and brings some back. again with the othere seasons rhino messed up with the packaging...well kinda.

My friends aren't really into some of the things i like (cartoons,comics etc) and they didn't understand my glee.

I had to use her name. Now to the review!

I have been a fan of Beast Wars ever since I saw the first episode, and I saw every episode when it was on TV. The third

season is my favorite season since it wraps the show up very

well.

The Things I Like About Season 3:

1. Newer and better forms to already-great Transformers; the

  new forms of Optimus, Megatron, and Cheetor to name some of

  them. They look better than ever.

2. The true revelation of the Vok aliens; they were mysterious

  in the first 2 seasons, but their physical appearances are

  finally shown. They look really cool.

3. New Transformers; there's really only 1 new Transformer in

  this season (Depth Charge) if you consider Tigerhawk as a new

  form of Tigatron and Airrazor.

The Things I Don't Like About Season 3:

1. Optimal Optimus barely showed his beast mode in the show. I

  think he only showed it in 'Optimal Situation', 'Feral Scream

  Pt. 1', and 'Feral Scream Pt. 2'.

2. Transmetal 2 Megatron, Transmetal 2 Blackarachnia, and

  Tigerhawk are revealed toward the end of the series, so they

  aren't in the series for very long.

(The disadvantages can be overlooked pretty easily.) I think

 this season wrapped up the show very well, especially since it

 has a very funny ending - Waspinator becomes the tribal leader

 of the Neaderthals! (Who would've thought?)

I can't wait for Beast Machines to come out on DVD, so then I'll

own my 2 favorite Transformers series. I can't wait!",1095638400,,1548,4.531365313653136

The show has creative plots, on-going storylines, 3 dimensional characters, and excellent dialog.  It is so much better than the slop that has been showing lately with 1 dimensional characters with dialog that makes me grit my teeth at times.

Beast Wars brought Transformers back from the brink of extinction.  It showed that it could be told in such a way that both adults and children can enjoy it, paving the way for the Dreamwave Transformers comics.",1095379200,,704,4.682926829268292

Special features include an animatic from Nemesis Part 2 and a very important deleted scene.  Though I wish we could have gotten some interviews with the voice actors or other creators, any special features at all are a treat, and the ones we get are nothing to complain about.

My interest because almost automatically peeked with the birth of the Beast Wars because I felt that the Beast Wars addressed many of the problems which the third and fourth seasons suffered from... (1) Too many characters, the Beast Wars had many characters but not so many which prevented proper character development of each major player. You felt like you really knew the characters by the time the series wrapped itself up(2) An underlying plot even bigger than the Beast Wars, something not really dealt with in G1 until the appearance of Unicron in the movie, in Beast Wars it was the Vox who controlled the planet before the arrival of the Transformers and I thought they did an excellent job of tying this series to the G1 series.  (3) A credible villian leader, boy did I miss Megatron after he was converted to Galvatron, the insane tyrant thing got old very quick and the Beast Wars Megatron was the same clever, sly villian the original Megatron was.  (4) It had a PLANNED ending, unlike G1 which sort of faded into an ending instead.  The last season was my favorite because so much took place and I happened to like the transition to Beast Machines, the following season.  I also hope that they will release Beast Machines into DVD like they did the Beast Wars.  In my opinion, these two combined series had some of the best plot writing I had the pleasure of watching since the whole thing began in 1984.",1093737600,,1591,4.584507042253521
2102838,4,B0002LE9HW,"Third season continued the beast wars at a frenetic pace.  Almost to fast at times.  The episodes are beautiful.  The animation is smooth and looks natural.  The writing however becomes forced as more and more characters are introduced.  Now I like the introduction of Depth Charge, however his apearance streaches the credibility of season two.  After all the Maximals are trapped in the past and have had two attempts at rescue.  Once by a probe in season 1 and once by Ravage in season two.  As such only the predacons know about the maximals being traped in earth in the past.  Then along comes depth charge , the law man, a maximal.  If he could have found them, anybody could have.
  This season has more tongue in cheek comedy than the previous two seasons before it but the jokes are sharp and all but attack Hasbro and the toy company that is sponsoring them.  Example:  Rat Trap's coment on Optimus changing bodies frequently is a direct attack on the fact that Hasbro put out several beast wars Optimus Primals during the show and forced the T.V. series to integrate the new toys.
  Final coments.  I enjoyed the series becasue it dealt with war in a true to life context.  People do not always hit their target.  People run out of amunition. People get hurt and in war people die.  The fact that only 7 Transformers survive all three seasons (out of 25 transformers) is just incredible and shows what a high mortality rate the show had.
  Thoughts on the ""Transformer Religion"" that was brought into play during the third season.  I'm still undecided.  It was well written but I'm not sure if it had a place in the show.  After all religion is a very controversial subject these days and has ended more than one transformer series in the past.

Enjoy:

2102839,5,B0002LE9HW,"When I was an adolecent, I grew up watching Beast Wars. Every weekend, I'd wake up to the sound of, ""Maximals, maximize!"" Every character, every plot twist, and every G1 plug was, to me, ingenius.

The show having been off the air now for x-amount of years is finally being released on DVD. Season three, the final season,  tied up all of the loose ends in the Beast Wars universe, provided us  viewers with sweet new transformers and upgrades (Transmetal 2), and the absolute in climactic endings.

The only problem with this season is that even though there are new Transformers, due to to the brevity of the season, only appear for a short period of time. Seriously, one Transformer is introduced three episodes before the series ends.

By the way, I do not reccomend seeing Beast Machines because this show practically killed the franchise. It's a sequel, it's tempting, but it's not worth it.

Anyways, season three is great. A must buy.

P.S. An easter egg on this DVD is the famed deleted scene in Nemesis part 2 where G1 Megatron's spark is returned to his body!",1093132800,,1070,4.659574468085107
2102840,4,B0002LE9HW,"I see a few people here call this show and this particular season to be the best CGI show ever.  I disagree.  Is Transformers: Beast Wars a good show?  Sure it is.  Very G1 fan oriented.  Not too kiddy like some of the other new Transformer shows...*cough* R.I.D. *cough*.  I have always liked the Beast Wars show when I caught it in syndication back in '99.  I enjoyed the violence level.  Enough to satisfy the aging G1 fan, but light enough to not make it a ""bloodfest"" to scare away younger viewers.

But what I disagree with is that is this the best CGI show since Reboot (as I see someone mentioned)?  No.  If you like Mainframe Entertainment's animation style, I suggest you also check out Shadow Raiders: War Planets.  Same company, same animation style, but one step up from Beast Wars technical wise (probably on the same level of Beast Machines).  Also, the story line is much more intense and realistic than say Beast Wars.  SR:WP is basically STAR WARS in CGI.  In fact, several scenes were taken directly out of Star Wars.  I had a giggle whenever I saw a direct reference.  If you like a good sci-fi CG animated epic, then go check out Shadow Raiders, but beware, the DVDs appear to be ""out of print"".

But back to Beast Wars: Season 3.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to see every episode of this season back in '99.  I seemed to keep missing the final 4 or 5 episodes.  I'd always end up catching the restart of Season 1.  But anyway, after reading through several episode synopsis around the Net, I came to the conclusion that this show and even Beast Machines still had a very good to decent sci-fi story to it.  Speaking of Beast Machines...I never really saw that series.  I think I caught one episode one time, was lost, so I didn't even try to follow it.  But I am looking forward to their eventual DVD releases next year.  *crosses fingers*",1092960000,,1861,4.464285714285714
2102841,3,B0002LE9HW,"The writers had wanted to avoid magically upgrading all of the characters to match their new toys in Season 2, and were over-ruled by Hasbro. They got their wish with Season 3, and the extended ""Transmetal Driver"" plotline. This means that the upgrades make a bit more sense, but are also stretched across the season, and become a major plotline of the season.

In a 13 episode season, 7 episodes are toy introductions. That's a lot.

The Maximals also became much more reactive to Megatron's plans, and were forced to hang out around the Ark to protect the Autobots and Decepticons in stasis lock. It was probably meant to ratchet up the desparation of our heros, but it just didn't work.

The last few episodes are a bit too rushed, as the writers had to tie up a lot of loose ends too quickly. Some threads were left loose (Tarantulus's plan, for instance, and why Megatron would take it up).

On the plus side, the animation was great, and we got a couple of really good stand-alone episodes (""Crossing the Rubicon"" comes to mind), but all in all, this season never hit the heights of Season 2.",1092009600,,1098,4.558375634517766
2102842,1,B0002LE9HW,"Beast Wars Season 3 is absolutely dreadful.

By this point, the show had managed to make the toys popular again and so the toy releases started dictating the storylines. No longer were new character added intermittently, when it was necesssary for a storyline, but now there was a new character or upgrade in every episode. This left very little room for the same kind of depth being put into the stories in Seasons 1 & 2.

In fact, this casued Bob Forward and Steve Ball, the principle writers and architects of Seasons 1 & 2 to quit the show. Their contribution to Season 3 was the outline of where they intended to take the story, only some of which was used. I can't recall a single episode in Season 3 that was worthwhile, and I especially disliked the new Dinobot. They should've just left him out of the whole affair.

So as far as I'm concerned, the answer to the question posed in the final episode of Season 2 'The End?' is a resounding YES.

Megatron wins, end of story.

(And don't get me started on how lame Beast Machines was.)",1091664000,,1041,4.429319371727749
2102843,5,B0002LE9HW,FINALLY!.. this is the one season I have been waiting for since buying season 1. Now I can say I am a TruE beast wars & TransFormers (GEN1). Season 3 is my favourite because it shows the true meaning ROBOTS IN DISGUISE!..also showing more of emotions/feelings from the characters which is nice to see b/c it makes the show more interesting and realistic..,1090281600,,355,4.650793650793651
2102844,5,B0002LE9HW,"This season is one of the greatest of any show. True Season 2 is considered the ultimate but I think season 3 has its own merrits. I'll even list them as I did in my Beast Machines review.
The good things...
1. Optimal Optimus, Dragon Megatron, Depth charge and Tigerhawk kick ass. My favorite being Dragon Megatron.
2. More comedy.
3. Higher stakes...(A.K.A the end of all things)
4. a crazy amount of re-watch value (of which Reboot can only dream of)
5. Megatron doesn't wear a skirt (Like in Beast Machines)
6. Great Action and plot.
There are still some bad things to be sure, but not worth noting...but I'll note it anyway.
1. The end of the Beast Wars Seams Rushed...they could have used another episode or two to tie things up at a better pace.
2. They never show G1 Megatron's spark get restored
3 what happened to the rest of the stasis pods?
4. Dragon Megatron was only a 4 episode thing....I want more!
5. Tigerhawk was a 2 episode thing....(same)
6. Transmetal 2 takes a while to get used to, but hey after seeing what everyone looks like in Beast machines (Rattrap is a wheelchair!!!!! Whyyyy!!!!!!) then trans 2 is very super okay.
This is without a doubt the best CGI series made to date with Reboot running second. It will always kill reboot (which is an amazing show) because of production values, comedy, characters, plot and re-watch value....(wopping amounts of action in the form of gunfire) I bought the others and I'm buying this too, and it's so cheap!
Just don't see Beast Machines....(really beast wars seasons 4 and 5 of the series) they kind of ruined this generation and it saddens me....sob sob.
The worst part of the beast wars is that its over...but they ended it before it became old and it went out with dignity and memories to last a lifetime.",1090281600,,1779,4.5625
2102845,5,B0002LE9HW,"So now the third season is released and long-time fans of the show such as myself will be able to own the entire series. Ok the first episode picks up where the season 2 finale left off and effectively wraps things up. This season was not as dark as the second (except for the two-part series finale) but had some great episodes with some great moments. The Ark and the Autobots and Decepticons inside play a big part in this season as they figure into many of the storylines.
SPOILERS AHEAD:
The last two episodes are unique among 'childrens' shows for many reasons, one of which being that death of most of the cast.
Dinobot reappears as a clone, Megatron steals the spark of the original Decepticon, as well as many other storylines make this a season worth owning.",1089936000,,768,4.532374100719425

Also, the interior wasn't as uniquely designed as the other two old sets, but that doesn't really have t do with the quality so I'll give it a pass. Either way, the guide booklet and disks themselves still hold the classic stuff of Beast Wars Season 3, which is all I really wanted in the end. The Episodes were just as awesome as I remember them to be and it's really great to have all of the 3 seasons finally (if separately) at my house now.
