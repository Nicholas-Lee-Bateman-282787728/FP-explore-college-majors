8154227,3,B000K3QKJM,"While any Yu-Gi-Oh! product is a treasure to the true collector, I was a bit disappointed with this one. It is simply more of the same. I thought perhaps it was a review or some behind the scenes extras, but it is simply episodes that deal with the ""past"" from Season 2, Battle City, on top of that there are only 3 episodes- Obelisk the Tormentor, Yugi vs. Rare Hunter 1, and Yugi vs. Rare Hunter 2. So if you already have those in another form, unless you simply want all you can get your hands on, don't bother, because there are no special features.",1245628800,2,553,4.276190476190476
