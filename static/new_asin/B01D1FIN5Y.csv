7696039,1,B01D1FIN5Y,Cannot even give it one star. $29.00 and it is full of commercials for Fox! What a rip off. P. S. I had to give 1 Star to submit this review.,1511481600,7,141,3.5806451612903225

7696041,5,B01D1FIN5Y,"FIRST!

It's Family Guy, and it's exactly what I expected.",1508198400,2,58,4.8
7696042,1,B01D1FIN5Y,"I will never buy another season, I hate that Fox forces ads for their other crappy shows into videos that I purchase.  I paid for this season, I shouldnt have to be sold other crap when I know exactly what I intended to buy. It makes me unbelievably angry, most of the time an outright purchase gets you around the ads.",1527897600,,319,4.229508196721311
7696043,3,B01D1FIN5Y,"I've watched every season of Family Guy, and loved many of the episodes in previous seasons. I liked the weirdness and unpredictability of the show.

This season, not so much.

The writing feels tired. Some episodes are good, but most are formulaic, with gags borrowed directly from previous years shows. The performances are good... the voice actors are excellent... but the material is not up to snuff.

I can see why this might be true. Many TV shows go into decline in their last season or two. I don't know if Family Guy is approaching the end, but if the writing this season is the best they can come up with, it might be good to consider wrapping things up, and moving on to something the writers are more interested in. They don't feel too interested this time around.",1527724800,,776,4.568345323741007
7696044,3,B01D1FIN5Y,I absolutely love the show. However I feel that the pricing is too high even for a single episode. At the very most I think a single episode should be only $0.99 .,1526860800,,163,3.9696969696969697
7696045,4,B01D1FIN5Y,Season 16 wasn't as good as Season 15. I might be the loner or odd man out with this whole deal but that's how I feel. I think there are hilarious episodes that stand out in this season but there are definitely some down ones too.,1525910400,,230,4.021739130434782
7696046,5,B01D1FIN5Y,It's Family Guy - You either love it or you don't. We love it!,1525046400,4,62,3.5
7696047,2,B01D1FIN5Y,Past seasons were alot better,1524441600,,29,5.0
7696048,1,B01D1FIN5Y,"Very, VERY poor writing and inane without any truly revelatory satire. Whatta waste. Visuals are poor too. The worse season yet.",1524441600,,128,5.142857142857143
7696049,1,B01D1FIN5Y,"Same topical ""humor"" as it was 14 years ago. Also, I didn't buy this dribble, I had left my account signed into my brother in-laws Playstation. So I'm not rating the purchase itself, just the poor taste of my bro. Shame shame, brother-man.",1524355200,,239,4.5813953488372094
7696050,5,B01D1FIN5Y,"I've seen every episode of every season and been watching for so many years, season 16 changes the game and makes jokes you wouldnt believe, its absolutely hilarious and totally worth the purchase.",1523232000,,197,5.0
7696051,3,B01D1FIN5Y,"Meh. ""Send in Stewie"" was probably the worst episode in Family Guy's sixteen seasons. Other episodes only provide half hearted chuckles. Sad, but Family Guy always comes back stronger. Don't abandon this comedy gem for pretentious Netflix pilots that love the smell of their own farts. How can a television show fart? Or even 'like' said fart? Chill. Ask Netflix how.",1522800000,,367,5.032786885245901

7696053,5,B01D1FIN5Y,The problem is Amazon!!!! Family guy gets 5stars Amazon gets a negative ...star. Amazon has failed to provide us with at least three new episodes so far. It is unacceptable and for those of you that paid for the season I'd demand something for your troubles. I purchase the sd episodes one at a time because it costs the exact same amount as purchasing the entire season in sd except that I don't get ripped off when Amazon pulls stunts like this. Good luck to everyone.,1520812800,,470,4.476744186046512
7696054,1,B01D1FIN5Y,Seth and company are too busy tweeting about politics to be bothered with writing. Worst season ever.,1520294400,,101,5.0

7696056,1,B01D1FIN5Y,"Season 16.  No new episodes since  Jan. 12 and it is now Feb. 26.  Trending toward being the last season I purchase of this series.  Extremely disappointing.  Updated: Wow, March 12...2 months without a new show.  A total waste of time and money.  I'm through with Family Guy.",1519603200,6,276,4.625

Not only at the beginning (before the show) but even afterwards you will be treated to commercials for television shows!  Such a treat.  I couldn't recommend this enough for anyone who enjoys paying to watch advertisements.",1528243200,,323,4.732142857142857
8754634,1,B01D1FIN5Y,"The show is great, love it. However, I didn't expect to pay 35 dollars for something and have it riddled with commercials. If Amazon, FOX, or whomever is responsible decides to fix the content, then I will update the review. At this time, try to find another format or source.",1527984000,4,276,4.54
