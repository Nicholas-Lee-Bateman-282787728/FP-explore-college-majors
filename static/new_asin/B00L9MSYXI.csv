8664681,3,B00L9MSYXI,"I must own about 6 RHEINGOLD dvds, and have seen the entire RING in most of the world's major houses.  I know Frankfurt Opera but not this new RING.  If you are a Wagner ""junkie'"" then you may wish to add this to your collection.  There is some decent singing from some of the cast, and the production has its positive and negative visual moments.  If you are looking for your first RHEINGOLD, then keep looking.  This one, although I'd rate OK, is definitely not for you.",1426291200,,472,4.379310344827586
