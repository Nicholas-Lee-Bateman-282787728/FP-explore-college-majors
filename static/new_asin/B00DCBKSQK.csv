8591636,1,B00DCBKSQK,"I seriously need to start picking better prime movies (or maybe they are free on prime for a reason), Anyway, low budget anthology and not very interesting. V/H/S was better than this although I wasn't the biggest fan of that either. Avoid this one though",1522713600,,255,4.688888888888889
8591637,3,B00DCBKSQK,"The collection of horror/ gore shorts are unique and creative spins on classic moral tales from twisted minds. A battered VHS and a small bounty of cassettes create a reality unlike any that Ruether has brought to life ever before, from reunions of the undead to a killer Krampus the low budget stories cover it all. Completed by a bizarre and clever wrap around that involves tweekers looking for a better high that is said to come from experiencing the stories captured on the cassettes,

The stories in this anthology are all cool low budget shorts that are filled with dark humor and plenty of gore. The plots are simple and straight forward moral tales save Lepus. I don't know what that was but it was so much fun to watch. I felt like I was in some twisted world mixed of 60s acid dream theatre and Adult Swim psychotica. The production value is pretty low in the anthology but the shorts are so much gruesome fun to watch that it doesnt matter. Death By VHS is a totally cheap and trashy delight that celebrates everything great about those gory days of VHS. This is by far my favorite of Walter Ruethers films!",1433462400,2,1119,4.512315270935961
8591638,1,B00DCBKSQK,"$18 for this. Woe to those who spent anything close to that. Hell, I got this atrocious piece of awful for fifty cents at Blockbuster during their going out of business selloff and I'm trying to figure out how to get my money back. It's THAT bad.

I've sat through home videos with better production values and I'm not even slightly kidding.

Anybody who rayed this above a 2 likely worked on it or knows somebody who did.
Avoid. Not even woeth the $0.50 I spent",1390608000,2,462,4.3604651162790695
8591639,1,B00DCBKSQK,"Ok folks.  I'm as much for a good 'B' horror flick as the next guy, and having read the reviews of this 'film' at Amazon.com, I ordered it.  I'm now watching this title for the first time, and before you consider buying or renting 'Death by VHS', here's what you really need to know:

First, this is not an actual film with things like, you know, production value.  It's made by amateurs and looks like what you'd expect to see as the mid-term project from a would-be film major who clearly couldn't get into USC.  Honestly, I've never seen anything that was so difficult to watch - just from the standpoint of things like the use of a cheap video camera, or bad editing ever in my life.  Ever.

Secondly, the people who appear in this film (I won't call them actors - that would be inaccurate) are, without question or exception, *the worst performers* I have ever seen in my life.  In any context.  Ever.  You know the dialogue scenes in-between the racier scenes of adult films?  You know how good the acting is in *those* scenes?  Well, compared to the acting in 'Death by VHS,' the performances in those scenes are Oscar-worthy.  Seriously, my cats would be more convincing (and more fun to watch) in any of the roles in this title than the people who were chosen to perform in this piece.  To the performers:  seriously, guys, don't quit your day jobs.  There are bars and restaurants who desperately need your help.

Third, there's not a shred of originality to this title.  I mean, just from reading the name of the film (Death by VHS?), you already know that the plot is probably going to resemble that of films like, you know, V/H/S.  This film doesn't resemble V/H/S.  It's a god-awful remake of V/H/S, that is itself comprised of god-awful remakes of whatever films led the director of this train-wreck to attempt this exercise in futility - for example, 'Night of the Living Dead,' or the classic 'Tales from the Crypt' story 'And all through the house . . . ' (about the insane Santa).

I could go on and on, but bottom line:  'Death by VHS' is not a 'B' horror flick (or a 'flick' of any kind for that matter.)  It's not going to be a 'cult classic.'  It isn't even so bad that it's good or funny.  Rather, 'Death by VHS' is so bad, in every conceivable way, that watching it is actually both painful for the audience and should be embarrassing to anyone who had anything to do with this totally inept YouTube video masquerading as some kind of legitimate title worthy of being sold on Amazon.com.  I'm giving it a one-star review because that's the worst rating I can give it, but truthfully, giving this title a one-star review is an insult to legitimate one-star titles.

In short, avoid 'Death by VHS' at all costs.  You'll be glad you did.

PS:  You can ignore these other reviews of 'Death by VHS.'  After watching this film, I can tell you with 99% certainty that all of them (except, perhaps, the three-star review) were written by the people who wrote, produced, directed or appeared in this title.",1382054400,9,3022,4.510128913443831
8591640,4,B00DCBKSQK,"So much awesome horror goodness to be had here! This far exceeded my wildest dreams, haha! It's campy, old school...the good stuff. I was sold by the title, but the movie made me a believer.",1374969600,,190,4.457142857142857

8591642,5,B00DCBKSQK,"Death by VHS is entertaining, gore filled, indie horror at it's finest. It has a great soundtrack too. Seriously, do not miss this fun flick!",1371427200,,141,4.68

8591644,5,B00DCBKSQK,Scarlet Fry in my opinion always makes an entertaining horror film. That being said Death by VHS is no exception to that. This film will remind of you of why you are a fan of independent horror! Being a huge fan of indie horror and an indie filmmaker myself I look for great and unique projects like this. Take the time to watch this and you'll see for yourself it's worth every penny!,1370995200,2,385,4.287671232876712
