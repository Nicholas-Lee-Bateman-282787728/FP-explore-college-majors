8475892,5,B005JO4XFK,Amazingly festive documentary that answers so many questions from Christmas lights to Santa Clause. Unfortunatly dose not come in HD or Blu Ray. With that said I highly recommend this for anyone who loves Christmas and would be interested in the  facts of Christmas and it's origins.,1437350400,4,283,5.0212765957446805
8475893,5,B005JO4XFK,"This a really great telling of the history of Christmas. I love seeing how things came to be the way we know them. May not be for religious people, but for anyone wanting to know the full story of modern day Christmas this is a great watch. It's not in HD, so you do need to be willing to watch a low-res video for an hour.",1422748800,2,323,3.909090909090909
