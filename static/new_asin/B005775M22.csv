4593751,5,B005775M22,"For a long time, Cartoon Network and just tv in general has just been ticking me off. But not to long ago, I heard of an upcoming cartoon called ""Adventure Time"". My first thoughts were ""Oh great, another crappy cartoon network shoq...""
Then I watched it.
Never in my life have I enjoyed a cartoon so immensely.
It's in my top 10 ""Greatest Tv shows of all time list""
Buy this dvd.",1311811200,16,380,4.291666666666667
4593752,5,B005775M22,"Dexter's Laboratory, Cow & Chicken, Power-Puff Girls, and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends are just some of the greats that crossed the age boundary and grabbed a huge audience; and now Adventure Time can be added to this exclusive club.
 To be honest, Cartoon Network has become a channel for the 12 and under set, but recently I was told to watch this crazy little show called Adventure Time.
 When I first saw the show I thought, ""Uh ... no."" My opinion was primarily due to the many crappy cartoons that have been recently shown on Cartoon Network, plus the Adventure Time animation was pretty trippy. But after a few more minutes of watching the show ... I feel in complete obsession with the show.\
 The show is so, so funny. It's funny enough that not only will the little ones love it, but the teens, 20-somethings, and possibly even the adults will enjoy it, primarily due to all the great innuendoes. It's hilarious. I just can't get enough of it and can't wait for the first season to come out on DVD. So good.",1310688000,3,1024,4.524324324324325

4593768,2,B005775M22,Look I love adventure time. And the episodes on the DVD are great. But I only got it because the full seasons of the show weren't available. I'd say the ONLY reason to buy this is if somehow ALL the episodes you loved the most were the ones collected on here. Otherwise just go for the the season sets.,1398902400,,302,4.135593220338983
4593769,5,B005775M22,This show is so goofy and silly. my 5 year old daughter loves it! i would maybe reccommend your child be a little older because of the fighting and potty humor and gratuitious use of words like stupid and jerk and things like that. not a good show for an immature child who will be repeating a lot! this is definitely one that parents and children can enjoy together!!!,1390953600,,369,4.36231884057971
4593770,5,B005775M22,Can never go wrong with adventure time!!!!!! Best gift you can ever get sumone lol even me at 27 I love this show my daughter was.so surprised when she seen it :),1390262400,,162,4.09375

4593772,5,B005775M22,"Highly recommended for getting someone into the show and/or needing something to watch after a few beers. Really a great collection and worth having for any fan.

I've noticed some complaints about how it isn't a full season or even chronological. Yes, both of these are the case, however I don't believe that that warrants a bad review. It's a collection of episodes (and does not claim to be anything else) that just so happen to be some of the best episodes from the first few seasons and will even get laughs from those that have seen them more than once.",1384646400,,559,4.534653465346534

4593784,5,B005775M22,"I cannot and will not ever say anything bad about Adventure Time.  The only complaint I have is how Cartoon Network chooses to distribute its programming.  It only releases shows like Adventure Time on hard copy with out of sequence (timeline wise) episodes that can be from any given season. This particular one has a few from seasons 1 and 2.  (Which are available on hard copy, but if you want anything after that you're basically SOL unless you get the downloadable versions.  Not everyone however, wants the electronic versions, they want hard copies for their collections.  I am one of those people.)  This set is good for entertaining a fan of the show for a few hours though, and it at least gives us some episodes to watch.

I'm an adult fan of the show.  I learned about it from my teenage son and haven't seen all of them like he has.  So I pretty much got this just to enjoy with him and delve into some of the episodes I may have missed.  It is fun looking for the snail and other hidden things within each episode.",1382054400,,1028,4.391534391534392

4593788,4,B005775M22,"The only thing that kept this from being five stars is being fewer episodes than the other collections - 12 instead of 16.  137 minutes of joy instead of 176 minutes of joy...
Great stories, still worth purchasing unless you go for full seasons.",1376352000,,245,4.568181818181818
4593789,5,B005775M22,"Adventure time, the exploits of Jake the dog and Finn the human, is to the present generation what Rocky and Bullwinkle was to their parents- smart witty subversive and equally enjoyable to kid and parent alike.

I've bought the Season 1 DVDs but I refuse to support this random sampling nonsense.
The show is up to season 5 now and season 2 isn't even expected to be released until June 4 2013.
Get some marketing sense, Cartoon Network. You've got some catching up to do.
I've pre-ordered the Season 1 and Season 2 Blu-Rays. They're available for pre-order here on Amazon.

4593849,1,B005775M22,"Cartoon network needs to stop jerking their fans around with these randomly compiled dvd collections. They allow their Adult Swim series to have full season dvd releases, I don't see why the shows aimed at the younger crowd should be any different. All of ""Foster's Home"" was never released (as far as I know) and now you can't find anything beyond season 1 on DVD (for less than $50 if you can even find it). It is a true disservice to the fans of the show that want hard copies of theses shows to keep for future viewing or to share with future generations. I have a son due to be born in March and I have several of my favorite shows from growing up and current favorites on hard for when he gets old enough to share them with him.

I hate 1-staring Adventure Time - but all of these collections will be receiving this rating. I think you can tell the mood of your audience by looking at the 1 & 2 star reviews for this collection.

Instant video doesn't count either - I want the disc.",1357516800,7,989,4.227513227513228

4593852,5,B005775M22,"This product is exactly what you would expect it to be. The only problem I had was that I didn't realize it wasn't the ENTIRE first season, which Amazon also sells. This was mostly my mistake, but Amazon was very good about it. They gave me a full refund and let me keep the video. I did buy the full season though.

4593879,1,B005775M22,"I would like to express my disappointment in Cartoon Networks/Dreamworks insatiable greed. I love certain programs like Adventure Time. However, I am outraged on how there are now, not one, but five random selections of episodes out on DVD. I will take time out of my day to make sure reviews on all websites that sell these partial seasons will clearly tell people how CN/DW is driven by greed and not to buy these mixed seasons and not to support partial season DVDs. You can put crap in a shiny box and call it a favor, but it is still crap. So many customers demand full seasons ONLY! You may fool the average consumer, but with a little education, my fellow peers will have their eyes opened to CN/DW's deceit of its customers and insatiable greed. What ever happened to producing quality products? What ever happened to companies that didn't try to gouge the customer and fool them into thinking they are getting a good deal? The DVD's cost you way less than a dollar to produce, but yet you want to try and fool the common customer to buy these mixed seasons of wonderful shows. Sadly, taking care of the customer and offering quality products appears to be a thing of the past.

Please don't hack up the dream works dragons of Burke when you put those seasons out on DVD. I will follow the releases and also educate the average customer on your business tactics and lack of general ethics. My voice will be heard, if not by CN/DW, but by the average consumer.

I don't normally complain, but I am sick and tired of large companies scamming and price gouging the loyal fans for the sake of a few extra bucks. America is no longer a producer of quality, now it seems we are a producer of deception and greed. You should be ASHAMED CARTOON NETWORK/DREAMWORKS!",1333497600,9,1764,4.5266457680250785

The non-sensical endings remind me a bit of Aqua Teen Hunger Force but that's about the only similarity. The episodes are cleverly written and the plots are very original, which is saying something for a ""children's"" show.

The only reason I rated the DVD 4 stars is because of the peculiar episode selection. They're out of sequence, and I wouldn't say the episodes are my favorites. I'd be really interesting in finding out why these particular episodes were chosen.",1328486400,,663,4.61864406779661

4593947,5,B005775M22,"I haven't felt this way about an American animated show since Avatar: The Last Airbender. I think this show is really a masterpiece. The comedy is very imaginative, though you have to be able to appreciate the absurd, but there are also a lot of great character moments. I really like the dynamics between the main characters of Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum, and Marceline. The stories have a lot of heart and make me feel good in a way that I don't really get from other shows.

This disc, as others have said, is pretty bare-bones. Half-episodes presented out of order, excerpted from both seasons 1 and 2. The video quality is decent, though the fact that is a DVD limits this in terms of detail and compression artifacts. It appears that the picture is somewhat over-sharpened to compensate, as there are ringing artifacts around edges. The only extra is a set of character facts about the main characters, most of which are obvious if you watch the show (though I think it also contains a mistake re: PB's age). Note also that the disc is finicky when I play it in my computer. Sometimes the disc doesn't load, sometimes it can't play certain parts. And I've tried it in two different optical drives, so I think it is due to how the disc was mastered.

I primarily bought this disc in order to show support for the series and encourage Cartoon Network to produce full series releases in both DVD and Blu-ray formats. I think this show would really shine on Blu-ray, as it is produced in 1080i resolution and the scenes contain a ton of small details that are blurred in the DVD release. The series also ought to be presented in episode order, as there are a lot of small details that can be gleaned from the backgrounds and plot points of each episode, which all together build up hints of the larger back-story to the series.

Get on this, Cartoon Network! I need me my Blu-ray releases!",1324512000,,1895,4.551319648093842

4593949,5,B005775M22,This is a great kids show! My husband and I really enjoy watching these cartoons with our 7 year old son. Light hearted and very funny.,1323820800,,135,4.230769230769231
4593950,5,B005775M22,This is a great cartoon.  All ages have something to take away from this I feel.  It has unique humor and characters.  For the price it is worth taking a chance on.,1322524800,,164,4.0625
4593951,3,B005775M22,"I love Adventure Time. I find it to be sharp and cute, and maintains the edge that a lot of cartoons these days have lost in this age of hyper-sensitive media. Growing up with Ren & Stimpy, I've missed that sharp border of treading on what's crude and funny with being bizarre and imaginative. While, compared to the Ren & Stimpy, Adventure Time is hardly what I'd call crude, but it is a show that pushes boundaries and borders and comes up with some amazing visuals and ideas, all the while maintaining this childlike wonderment and youthful spirit that I had when playing as a child. It's like some sort of bizzaro-world version of Winnie The Pooh.

Having said that, when I heard this DVD was coming out and it wasn't going to be a full season set, I was hesitant to buy it but have just recently made the lunge into purchasing it anyway. The rumor was that based on sales of the DVD, Cartoon Network would decide whether or not to release a full season box set... which makes sense to me yet doesn't make sense to me. Especially since it's not even the first fourteen episodes, but rather a mishmash of Adventure Time's ""Greatest Hits"" from the first two seasons or so.

First off, I get that Cartoon Network wants to test the waters before putting out a full release. To anybody I've read thinking that they have the all this money and are trying to simply sucker money off of you, just look at the past track record. Look how much Flapjack merch you used to see at Hot Topic. Look how many DVD releases there were. Look how quickly that show got cancelled. Name the newest ""made for Cartoon Network by Cartoon Network"" show that has gotten a full season DVD. Scooby Doo: Mystery Inc. and The Looney Tunes Show simply got ""Volume 1"" releases, chronicling the first five episodes or so. They did the same thing with Flapjack and Chowder and released no DVDs after that. THAT is how you test DVD sales, so you can keep adding on in order. At this rate, by the time a complete first or second season box set comes out, the people who already bought this will only be missing a few episodes. That's just bad business and kind of dooming the product to fail.

Second, what annoys me is the presentation of these episodes. Now, maybe this isn't the official way they're produced by Frederator or whatever - I have no idea how the behind-the-scenes process works - but I've always seen them listed on IMDB and Wikipedia as supposing to be paired up with the episodes that aired right after them, forming a 30 minute block with commercials. Maybe things had to change for the way this DVD was constructed, with each 10-12 minute cartoon broken apart from it's counterpart, but each cartoon is proceeded and followed with opening and closing credits. I love the music and animation for both, but when repeated fourteen times on the disc, it seems like a bit of a waste of space and time and would've felt more appropriate were it only done every two cartoons.

Another thing that I don't like about the presentation is there is an episode that is actually MISSING a small segment. I don't believe it's censorship but moreso just an error in the compiling of the disc. At the end of the ""Treetrunks"" episode, there's supposed to be a small, couple seconds long clip of Treetrunks walking through some sort of Gem Apple wonderland. It's not really an important clip, doesn't serve too much to the story (They made a sequel to the episode later anyway, so it's not like the business was unresolved), but it just bothers me to know that something is missing - something that still airs anytime I see the cartoon repeat on television.

Aside from that missing clip and overall episode presentation, the bonus features are somewhat of a joke. It's nothing more than character profiles of a few of the reoccuring characters, and then one character who as of now has only appeared in one episode... so why he was included is entirely beyond me. They also made a toy of him it seems, advertised on the tray liner of the DVD, so their marketing department just baffles me beyond words. The menus are also kind of drab, but that's hardly a big deal. The annoying thing is that there seems to be two songs that get chosen for all the different pages on the menu, making me even sicker of the theme song and end credits music when simply reading the character profiles on the disc.

Other than that, I love the outer and overall design of the disc. The cover art is fun and nicely detailed, really capturing the spirit of the show. On the previously mentioned tray liner with the toy advertisment, there's also a picture from the title card of the ""My Two Favorite People"" episode. I get that the disc is named after that episode, but I don't really see why its included. Seems like they should've either included some original art or something that captured the show a little bit better.

So if you're looking for a ""greatest hits"" compilation of sorts, this isn't that bad. But like any greatest hits by any artist, not only will there be a few things changed - songs cut for time or altered and tweaked - but there's also so many tracks missing that will leave you searching for the originating albums instead. In this case, these albums don't exist. At least not without bootlegging it. If your kids love the show, they'll no doubt dig this package. If you love the show yourself and find yourself reading this, debating on making the purchase, I don't have anything to tell you, man. You need to make that decision yourself. There's some good episodes, but there's a lot of room for improvement.

Here's to hoping that on the release of a Season One box set, should there ever be one, that Cartoon Network gets the rights to the pilot episode from Nickelodeon and Paramount.

The wildly (and surprisingly) popular Cartoon Network series has your two heroes and all their friends such as Princess Bubblegum, and enemies like the Ice King gallivanting all over the magical land of Ooo in a dozen (that's 12) daring episodes like:

""My Two Favorite People"" (Emmy Nominated episode) - Jake spends some time with his buddy Finn and his girlfriend Lady Rainicorn.  But when the two get a little too close for comfort, Jake attempts to intervene.

""Evicted"" - Meet Marceline the Vampire Queen who kicks Finn and Jake out of their tree house forcing them to find a new place to crash.

""Trouble in Lumpy Space"" - Jake gets bitten by the Lumpy Space Princess (or LSP for short) and gets infected.  To cure his pal, Finn must travel into Lumpy Space and find the cure.

""Tree Trunks"" - Finn and Jake reluctantly take their apple-loving pachyderm pal Tree Trunks on a quest to find the Crystal Apple.

""Dungeon"" - Princess Bubblegum advises Finn not to go into a scary-looking dungeon where a crystal eye is hidden.  Did he listen ?  Well, what do you think ?

""The Eyes"" - After another day of adventuring, Finn and Jake go to bed, but they can't shake the feeling they're being watched.

If you think that's ""algebraic"", there's a special feature called ""Little Did You Know"" where you can dig up delicious dirt on some of your favorite characters.  So get this DVD if you're a huge fan of this mathematical hit series from Cartoon Network and Frederator Studios (This is perhaps their only series outside of Nickelodeon.

I was pleasently suprised to see that this dvd contained the episode about Lumpy Space Princess,as she is one of my favorite characters because of how she talks (MA PARENTS ARE LIKE HORRIBLE IDIOTS!)

The only reason why I gave this four stars as opposed to five is because like all the other fans have stated,I would much rather own a complete season of Adventure Time rather than these volume deals CN keeps feeding us.

I don't know why the big wigs at Cartoon Network keep cheating their viewers like this. First we only get one season of Billy and Mandy,then only two seasons of Foster's,lastly only two VOLUMES of Chowder. Now this last dvd release is a few scraps of Adventure Time.

In my opinion,more shows like Adventure Time should be put out on whole dvd sets;esp when the demand is there.

As for Cartoon Network in general,they would do alot better if they had more shows like Adventure Time,Regular Show etc. They should also get rid of all the non-animated shows like destroy build destroy,hole in the wall,dude what would happen and all non-animated movies (the channel is called CARTOON network y'know?) I would also like to see Adult Swim have it's own channel, and Cartoon Network given back to kids and fans of regular non-explicit cartoons.

4594011,5,B005775M22,"""Adventure Time: My Two Favorite People"" is a very well put together compilation of some of the best episodes from season one.  I only wish that the creators would have already included all of the episodes from season one.  On the positive side, there are 12 innovating and original Adventure Episodes contained, and the following is the listing for anyone still considering:
1) My Two Favorite People
2) Evicted!
3) Ricardo the Heart Guy
4) Trouble in Lumpy Space
5  Tree Trunks
6) Dungeon
7) The Pods
8) The Limit
9) Go With Me
10) The Eyes
11) The Chamber of Frozen Blades
12) To Cut a Woman's Hair
There is also a special feature of: Little Did You Know.  My overall favorite episode in this collection is ""The Pods"".  ""The Pods"" is a hilarious episode that involves Finn and Jake agreeing to take up a magic bean quest for one of the knights who makes his transition to another realm.  Two of the beans are good, and one is very sinister.  The plot gets very funny when each of the three beans sprouts out items that actually appear at first neutral. I want to disclose more details, but I prefer to keep in mind those who have yet to watch this episode.  My only slight caveat with these series involves the ""To Cut a Woman's Hair"" episode.  I respectfully say this because there is one character that is depicted as an ugly witch who happens to be evil, and wants hair.  First off, beauty is subjective and in the eye of the beholder. This character fits the classic stereotype of only beautiful people being angelic and anyone plain-looking being mean.  I say this because it is common knowledge that there are very attractive people in the world that are very mischievous and calculating.  Then there are individuals who may fall outside of the conventional societal view of beauty, but have great compassion and kindness towards others around them.  However, I still recommend this ""Adventure Time"" collection for anyone who has enjoyed watching any of the ""Adventure Time"" episodes on television and/or those who enjoy their cartoons with elements that contain hybrids of fantasy/adventure themes.",1317081600,2,2108,4.742465753424658

Since the story isn't really pinned down, this would be a great video to lend to friends. Maybe later on down the road CN will realize they could profit from putting the seasons on DVD.

4594023,3,B005775M22,"I'm a little ashamed of how much I enjoy Adventure Time.

The land of Ooo is a wonderful blend of fantasy tropes and adventuring cliche (in a good way), cleverly wrapped in a post-apocalyptic world where magic has reappeared.  That isn't really part of the story, but it's a setting that could easily have fallen out of a particularly irreverent Dungeons & Dragons campaign.  I sometimes wish I could live in Ooo.

Finn and Jake thwart evil and face peril, but generally seem like pretty easy-going folks.  In fact, all of the inhabitants of Ooo seem extremely happy most of the time.  To be a hero in Ooo seems like a sweet life, and maybe that's what lures an older audience to the show.  Living in an awesome tree house and fighting monsters seems like a way better life than working for rent money.

The show is awesome.  This DVD is somewhat less so, unfortunately.

I got this DVD in the mail today, and it contains 12 episodes of Adventure Time.  That doesn't mean 12 half-hour(ish) television-length episodes, this is just 12 seemingly random segments, clocking around 14 minutes each.  I know that the chronology of a show like this one doesn't really matter too much, but these episodes don't appear in any particular order, and the quantity is a little lacking.

Rather than a full first-season release, we're getting roughly half of that here.  I pre-ordered it as soon as I found out about it, and for ten bucks, it's not a bad deal -- but this is a DVD made for parents to give to their children to watch on car rides, not for the slightly ashamed adult viewers who love the show and want to have creator commentary and tons of goodies.

There are technically special features, but they're pretty underwhelming -- short blurbs about a handful of recurring characters in the form of a picture and a short block of text.

Themed DVDs like this are, from what I understand, pretty standard for children's cartoons, but hopefully we'll see a full season release in the near future with, jeeze, commentary or something, I don't know.

Short version:  The show is worth five-stars, as any fan will tell you, but this DVD release is closer to a miss than a hit.  It's worth buying only if it convinces men in ties that a full release will make money, but once full season releases appear, there's nothing to recommend this little guy.

The storylines pack so much detail, action, and wonderful dialouge in those epic fifteen minutes of airtime.

They have a lot of adventures and fun with Bubblegum Princess & fight off the evil Ice King(voiced by Tom Kenny!!).There is also a song writing vampire who steals their house but later becomes pals with Finn,She eats the color red. There are a lot of cute & hilarious little characters like  Lady Rainicorn,(a rainbow unicorn who sometimes speaks korean)Bemo(like an atari but adorable and alive),LSP(A valley girl space alien princess),Cinnamon Bun,Starchy,ZOMBIE CANDY!!!!,Vikings,lots of cute various princesses. Paul Rubben voices an evil gnome for an episode, there are lots of recurring story lines and great new words for you to learn like ""ALGEBRAIC!"" & ""wHAT THE MATH?"".This show was just what I needed after my soul got crushed with Flapjack getting axed from cartoon network. Buy this show. You need it. It is worth it.",1313971200,3,977,5.10625
4594031,4,B005775M22,"See these guys above me with the 4 or 5 stars? Well go ahead and read their thoughts on this show, then read them again. Okay. Move your mouse over to the ""One Click Buy"" button and press it (provided you have all pertinent information filled out). Finished? Good. Now read the 4 and 5-star reviews again while gleefully waiting for your DVD set to arrive.

Addendum: I wonder if most of these guys are Futurama fans, as Jake the Dog is voiced by the ever talented John DiMaggio aka Bender (and a whole hell of a lot of other animated and videogame voices).",1312675200,,557,4.355769230769231
