8585883,1,B00CSW08Q4,"SIMPLY AWFUL! There are no title cards or openings except for the beginnings and end credits. I'm getting tired of these lazy releases. At least put the title cards with the episodes. It's compiled like it's one big movie instead of short episodes which they were. I rented it to see what it was like and now I know and as usual I was not happy. I guess, save your money or rent it off amazon and see for yourself.",1448409600,,414,4.1875
8585884,5,B00CSW08Q4,"My five year old son loves Alvin and the Chipmunks.  He laughed and laughed at some of the things that Alvin did in the movie.  I didn't get it, but he did!...LOL",1444953600,,162,4.03125
8585885,1,B00CSW08Q4,"I loved this cartoon as a child, but I must have blocked this episode from my memory. The chipmunks find an adorable kitten they adopt and name Cookie Chomper III. Hilarious antics ensue. Then the kitten gets outside and is hit by a car. The chipmunks deal with death. Seriously, what the heck?!? NOT what I was expecting to deal with explaining to my 3 year old today. Why has no one else mentioned this in the reviews!?! Obviously there is no episode list or description with this collection.",1442102400,3,494,4.561797752808989
