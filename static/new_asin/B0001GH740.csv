8280772,2,B0001GH740,"There is absolutely nothing super about this DVD selection.  The movies are mediocre - most of them are low-budget productions featuring once or future stars - and the price is pretty steep considering the content. For this collection, St. Clair Vision has placed the eight films on separate disks, each with it's own individual packaging which is overkill considering the material presented.

Films included in the package (and their ratings from an on-line movie site):

Bye Bye Baby (1988) (2.6):  Carol Alt and Brigette Nielsen
Ginger in the Morning (1974) (5.1):  Monte Markham, Susan Oliver and Sissy Spacek
Loose Shoes (1980) (5.0):  Bill Murray and Lewis Arquette
Lovers and Liars aka Viaggio con Anita (1980) (4.6):  Goldie Hawn, Giancarlo Giannini and Claudine Auger
Meet the Hollowheads (1989) (5.7):  John Glover and Juliette Lewis
The Seniors (1978) (4.8):  Jeffrey Byron, Gary Imhoff, and Dennis Quaid
There Goes the Bride (1980) (3.1):  Tom Smothers and Twiggy
The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West (1976) (2.6):  Bob Denver and Forrest Tucker",1220227200,,1057,5.232142857142857
