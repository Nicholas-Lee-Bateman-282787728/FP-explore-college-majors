Thankfully Amazon had the movie in several different versions.  I absolutely love this movie! I really enjoyed this version of Jesse James' story and the plot of the movie.

1652179,5,B00005QWAI,"The movie is all about the entertainment value it provides. It's not a movie you have to focus on completely, you won't get lost when life inevitably forces you away from it, and it'll brighten your day no matter how you are feeling with its humor and overall feel good storyline. The acting isn't phenomenal but the cast has excellent chemistry with each other and they play off one another extremely well. You won't call it the best movie you've ever seen but you will find yourself watching it over and over again throughout the years...and before you know it, you will find yourself putting it in your top 5 movie list.",1437177600,,623,4.571428571428571

1652181,1,B00005QWAI,"Trite and simplistic plot wavering on the edge of not being entertaining. One doesn't necessarily expect realistic characterization of these mythic individuals, but to portray them as so embarrassingly sentimental and predictable is too much to ask of the viewer.",1436918400,,263,5.6

If you take this movie seriously you are missing the point. It had some very funny scenes. If you want a good time get this. If you want a historical document, don't bother.

1652191,5,B00005QWAI,"Hollywood regales us with yet another telling of the saga of those vicious, murdering, thugs who became America's greatest demi-gods. the James-Younger gang.  And , Yikes!, did the critics and western purists hate it.  ""An inaccurate depiction of the real west"" they wept and wailed.  Well, thank God for that.  The real west was a place of unrelieved and unrewarding hard work.  Grim, filthy, and just plain disgusting.  We fans of westerns want the myth of the romantic old west and director Les Mayfield gives us that.  He glosses over the unsavory reality of the gang and portrays our guys as high-spirited rapscallions.  Boys just wanna have fun ya know.  Colin Farrell joins the ranks of impossibly handsome leading men(Tyronne Power and Brad Pitt were two others) to play the less than pretty Jesse(The real Jesse was weasel-faced).  Farrell is too contemporary to be convincingly ""Wild West""(As is all of the cast and the movie itself) but he is always exciting to watch.  You
can't take your eyes off him and he has all the charisma the real Jesse must have had to make men follow him unto their deaths.  The entire
cast is good, especially the supporting actors, some of the best character actors around today.  And Mayfield understood something that few directors of westerns ever understood, that women like westerns as much as men.  He gives the distaff side of the audience a heroine to be
proud of:  fresh-faced Ali Larter as Jesse's spunky wife, Zee.  No whiny pacifist schoolmarm in a starched corset.  She can hold her own with any of the men and she engineers Jesse's escape from the prison train(One of the most exciting scenes ever in a western). ""American
Outlaws"" IS full of inaccuracies.  And it has so many mistakes you could make a parlor game out of them.  It's not even a very good movie. But it is non-stop action and good humor.  Fun every bit of the way.  Deservedly becoming something of a cult favorite.

Video quality of my copy is OK and the sound is dim, I had to turn it way up. On the other hand I paid only $6.00 for it.  As my daddy used to say, ""You can't hardly beat it with a stick"".",1428710400,,2126,4.595744680851064
1652192,5,B00005QWAI,"This movie is in my TOP TEN!  I like it so much that this is the second copy I have orderedt.  I decided that if I have two copies, and loan one, I'll still have one.  The only problem I seem to have is remembering who I loan my movies to.  I have watched it at least 10 times, and each viewing brings the same enjoyment I experienced when I first watched it.  I would recommend it to everyone.",1428710400,,394,3.9367088607594938
1652193,5,B00005QWAI,I love this movie. It is funny and yet has enough action to keep you watching.,1428019200,,78,3.9375

1652195,5,B00005QWAI,Absolutely love this movie. It's the perfect outlaw romance of Jesse James. Of course it is dramatized but that's what makes it great. It's funny and full of action. I love Colin Farrell!,1427155200,,187,4.696969696969697

1652202,5,B00005QWAI,"You can't condemn the movie for lack of historical accuracy unless the director said it would be historically accurate, which he didn't. The writers of this film did exactly what all of ye olde dime-store-novel authors did; made up their own heavily romanticized stories about real-life people. Absolutely nothing wrong with that.

If you can understand that, and take the musket barrel out of your behind, you will probably really enjoy this movie. It's exciting, funny, sexy (Collin Farrell & Ali Larter provide abundant eye-candy for both genders), and just the right amount of cheesy. It has been one of my favorites since the first time I saw it, when I was like 12, and still is 10 years later at 22.

Also, as a student of film, I must more specifically commend the awesome cinematography, excellent production design, on-par acting, great stunt work, and the seriously rad use of modern Southern Rock music.

Just an overall good movie. I think I shall buy it on Blu-ray as soon as I finish writing this sentence.",1418515200,,1021,4.822857142857143

If you like westerns like ""The Long Riders"" then you'll give up 10 minutes into it. Just kind of a silly movie where everyone is a little too cool and the gunfights are ridiculous.",1407369600,,311,4.2

Those seeking historical accuracy on Jesse James and his gang will not find it in this movie.

1652254,4,B00005QWAI,"Released in 2001, ""American Outlaws"" is yet another rendition of Jesse James, Cole Younger and their Gang. This one focuses on the end of the Civil War and the first few years of the gang's activities,which lasted a whole decade in reality, from 1866-76, ending with the foiled Northfield, Minnesota, bank robbery on September 7, 1876. Jesse & Frank escaped while the others were captured or died. While Frank tried to settle down to a normal life in Virginia Jesse restarted the gang in 1879, but was shot by Robert Ford, one of his trusted gang members on April 3, 1882.

""American Outlaws"" is highlighted by a great cast with palpable chemistry, including Colin Farrell as Jesse, Scott Caan (aka 'Danno') as Cole, the beautiful Ali Larter as Zee, Jesse's girlfriend/wife, and Timothy Dalton as the lead Pinkerton. Gabriel Macht, Will McCormack, Nathaniel Arcand and Gregory Smith are also on hand as notable members of the gang. The film plays it fairly serious accented by a fun, joie de vivre spirit, sorta like Indiana Jones in the wild West. You can tell the cast had a blast during filming. This is the exact opposite of the grim ""The Long Riders"" from 1980, which is arguably the best and most accurate film about the James-Younger Gang.

As far as historical accuracy goes with ""American Outlaws,"" well, there was a group of outlaws in Missouri called the James-Younger Gang and they did rob banks, trains, and stagecoaches in Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, West Virginia and Minnesota (whereas Jesse's later group continued the gangs' criminal legacy in Alabama, Missouri, Louisiana and Mississippi), other than this the historicity is pretty butchered for the sake of rousing Western entertainment. See ""The Long Riders"" for a more austere and accurate version of the tale.

BOTTOM LINE: Even though ""American Outlaws"" loses points for inaccuracies and implausibilities, it scores high in overall entertainment value. It's a turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-blast kind of Western. The movie performed poorly at the box office in 2001 and Roger Ebert gave it a scathing review. Ebert compared it to 1972's ""The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid,"" which he praised. This was strange because that film wasn't exactly realistic either; in fact, it's a veritable parody or black comedy. These movies shouldn't be compared in the first place since ""American Outlaws"" details the gang's first year in action and ""The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"" the gang's final bank robbery, a whole decade later. Furthermore, the two films are expressly opposite in tone: ""American Outlaws"" makes the wild West larger-than-life and ALMOST fun while the other film de-glamorizes it, making it profane, ugly and idiotic. In any event, ""American Outlaws"" is seriously rollicking Western lore worthy of one's video library.

The film was shot in Central-East Texas (great locations, by the way) and runs a short-but-sweet 94 minutes.

GRADE: B",1294185600,,2950,5.202105263157895
1652255,5,B00005QWAI,"I watched this movie and laughed a lot through it, along with some one-word responses like ""WHOAAAAA!"" The Civil War battle in the beginning had a nice touch, even though the forces in it seemed small--one regiment of Confederate cavalry versus maybe two regiments of Federal troops and a battery of artillery, perhaps. And I find the situation AWKWARD when the cavalry are about to pursue the retreating Yankee forces and run straight into a long line of haggard Confederate troops. The dialogue goes like this:

COLE: What are you fellas doing? There's more Yankees back there!

CONFEDERATE SOLDIER: The war's over, son. General Lee surrendered yesterday at Appomattox.

BOB YOUNGER: Well, somebody better tell the damn Yankees!

That scene put kind of a twist on things, which incites the James and Cole brothers to go home back to Missouri, where they find a new threat hanging over their lives--railroad detectives trying to force farmers off their land and raising hell for anyone who refuses their offer of $2 an acre. Jesse James soon decides to declare a personal war on the railroad, hurting them most by simply robbing them of their financial assets.
Other critics harangue this film for it's ""lack of historical accuracy."" Well, if you want to see historical accuracy, go and watch the movie, ""The Life of Jesse James."" This movie never said ""Based on a True Story"" but simply revolves around the first daytime bank robberies in U.S. history, whether or not the scenes are true. 50 percent of the things in this movie may have never happened, but it still makes for a good movie. My favorite scene is when some of the gang members are guarding the bank from the outside, and trying to protect themselves from the cane of a bitter, indignant old man who wants to go to the bank.
OLD MAN: There ain't no gol-durned bank holiday!

INDIAN SCOUT: Sir, you're right about that.

OLD MAN: Well, why can't I go in there?

INDIAN SCOUT: On account on that we're uh...robbing it.

OLD MAN: Oh! Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?

1652256,5,B00005QWAI,"I just watched this movie recently, and I must say it is my favorite movie of all time now! I watch this movie almost daily because I love it so much! Scott Caan as Cole Younger was by far my favorite in the movie, but all the characters in my opinion matched the historical icon they were portraying. Collin Farrel did a great job as the cocky Jesse James, and Scott Caan did an Amazing job as tough Cole Younger. Ali Larter was fun to watch as Zerelda Mimms and Gabriel Match played the perfect part for Frank James! he was hilarious yet sophisticated in the role. another favorite for humor was Will McCormack as Bob Younger! he had those funny lines that were put in at the right times. This movie may not match history to the book, but it is still on of the best movies ever! You got the impression that these boys actually were related because of the affection they showed and how well they got along with each other. It was an all around Great movie with VERY handsome actors playing Cole and Jesse! the director did a wonderful job of keeping young women like myself in mind and giving us eye candy to watch.

1652257,3,B00005QWAI,"I kind of feel about this film like I do about `The Newton Boys'; it's a fun film with no real weight, but it works as a crowd pleasure if you are easily pleased.  This film is hardly as much fun as `The Newton Boys', but it has a similar vibe.  I love Colin Farrell (such an underrated actor, if not an overrated celebrity) but his performance here has no real depth.  He is just smitten with the camera (as it is with him) and so he delivers a charismatic portrayal of Jesse James that didn't win him any accolades but did win him legions of teenage fans.  The entire cast of rising Youngblood's (none of which made lasting careers outside of Farrell unless you count Larter's television resurgence) handles the mediocre material with charm, so they help lighten the mood and make the film tolerable.  That said, if you are looking for a historically accurate (or even just historically authentic) telling of the Wild West then I'd stay far away from this one.  If you just want a bright and semi-exciting teen flick then this may be what you are looking for.  Scott Caan is always a reliable `side man', and he easily manages `Best-in-Show' mentions here.  That isn't saying a whole lot, but I like him so what can I say.  I wouldn't recommend this one, but it's not awful so make of it what you will.",1278028800,,1304,4.422594142259414

""The James brothers, Frank and Jesse, were Confederate guerrillas during the Civil War, during which they were accused of participating in atrocities committed against Union soldiers. After the war, as members of one gang or another, they perpetrated many bank robberies which often resulted in the murder of bank employees or bystanders. They also waylaid stagecoaches and trains.""",1243555200,,713,5.0508474576271185
1652262,3,B00005QWAI,"As westerns go, ""American Outlaws"" amounts to an above-average horse opera that knows when to giddy-yap and when to giddy-up. Les Mayfield, who directed ""Flubber"" and ""Blue Streak,"" stages several exhilarating but bloodless gunfights that owe their epic grandeur to Hong Kong action maestro John Woo of ""Face/Off"" fame as much as traditional cowboy classics like Clint Eastwood's ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."" While this blatantly romanticized account of the notorious Jesse James-Cole Younger gang lacks the authenticity of either ""The Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid"" (1972) or ""The Long Riders"" (1980), Mayfield keeps the action going at a gallop. Moreover, scenarists Roderick Taylor and John Rogers have juggled the chronology of events to heighten dramatic impact. Clearly, ""American Outlaws"" duplicates the surefire ""Young Guns"" formula, portraying Jesse as a saintly Robin Hood bandit. While Irish heartthrob Colin Farrell resembles actor Tyrone Power, who starred as Jesse James in the prototypical 1939 Technicolor version of ""Jesse James,"" he looks nothing like the real-life Jesse Woodson James. Nevertheless,western aficionados should applaud the way that Mayfield has kept the conventions of the genre intact while adding enough fresh touches to enhance this superficial but stimulating shoot'em-up.

""American Outlaws"" covers the early years of James-Younger gang. The upbeat Taylor & Rogers script doesn't depict the tragic demise Jesse met at the hands of the double-crossing sidewinder who bushwhacked him for the bounty. This flavorful variation unfolds as the Civil War concludes. Federal troops have pinned down Frank James (Gabriel Macht of ""Simply Irresistible""), Cole Younger (Scott Caan of ""Varsity Blues""), and Bob Younger (Gregory Smith of ""Boiler Room"") with cannon fire when Jesse (Colin Farrell of ""Tigerland"") rides to their rescue. Mayfield establishes Jesse's hell-bent-for-leather audacity when our impetuous protagonist launches a fearless charge against an army of Yankees. Farrell imitates John Wayne in ""True Grit"" as he rides full-tilt into battle, blazing away with two six-shooters while he keeps his horses' reins clenched between his teeth.

After surviving this fracas, our heroes return to Missouri to resume farming. Along come villainous railroad baron Thaddeus Rains (Harris Yulin of ""Rush Hour 2"") and henchman Rollin Parker (Terry O'Quinn of ""The Stepfather"") who are stealing property at two dollars-per-acre. When they approach Ma James (Kathy Bates of ""Misery""), she wants her sons to gun them down. Frank convinces Ma to hold off. Rains' chief troubleshooter, Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton of ""License to Kill""), warns them that was Rains' only offer. Parker retaliates after the James refuse to sell and sends his ruffians to dynamite their farm. Ma James dies in the explosion, and Jesse and Frank saddle up with the Youngers to wreck vengeance on the railroad.

While ""American Outlaws"" doesn't qualify as a classic, this better-than-average sagebrusher provides a glimpse of the old West we haven't seen in many moons. As Jesse's stalwart wife Zee Mimms, Ali Larter of ""Final Destination"" has a way with stopping trains dead in their tracks. A crackerjack supporting cast, especially Dalton as Pinkerton, makes ""American Outlaws"" fun to watch.",1228694400,,3300,5.596

Mostly, this garbage allowed its cast of pretty faces the opportunity to play ""cowboys"" like a group of grade-school youngsters. Being a fan of American history, the West in general and the James-Younger Gang in particular, I remember going to see this film when it came out, and the only reason I didn't walk out was to make sure it was trash from start to finish.

1652267,3,B00005QWAI,"Having had little exposure to the whole Jessie James legend out here, it was with some interest and some curiosity that I sat down to view ""American Outlaws"". The anxiety was a little tense due to Colin Farrell, whose movies have been truly abominable at times.

While tweaking the historical side of things a bit, ""American Outlaws"" does seem to stick to basic phases of James' life. It also present Jessie James as a largely innocent Confederate hero returning from the ended Civil War. While that may be true in part, things are rarely so simple. So, the factual side has been played with substantially.

That said, what comes out at the end is a good movie with plenty of action, a good dose of humour and some good tension between various members of the James-Younger gang. None of it has been overdone to the point of absurdity, and ""American Outlaws"" is a good, basic Western movie with plenty of things going bang.

For a good action movie with a Western flavour, this is a good movie. While I would not say it is the best of the Western genre, I rather enjoyed it for what it is. A solid night's entertainment.",1182816000,,1119,4.52970297029703

The music chosen for this movie is also perfect. Colin Ferrell is at his best in this movie. I also thought Scott Caan gave a wonderful performance as Coleman Younger. Gabriel Macht was fabulous as Frank James. You will not be disappointed in this movie. This is a must own DVD. It is really great!

1652269,4,B00005QWAI,"American Outlaws is set in Missouri just after the Civil War. The railroad is constructing a track that will run west and go right through the town of Liberty, Missouri. The railroad company offers to buy each farmer's land otherwise they will just take it in the name of progress (imminent domain). Well, the railroad company picked the wrong town to go through and ran into Jesse James and company.

The cast is great and it includes Colin Farrell in one of his earliest roles) and also has two other recently known stars Ali Larter (Niki Sanders in Heroes) and Terry O'Quinn (John Locke in Lost).

I cannot attest to the movies accuracy of the story of Jesse James or the accuracy of the imitation of the post-Civil War era, but I can say that this movie is a blast to watch. It contains shootouts from beginning to end in all sorts of different settings (open fields, banks, main street, train). There are escapes/rescues in multiple places, plenty of humor mixed in and even a slight love story to round it off.

The movie itself is shot great and never gets hung up on any story line for too long in my opinion and it seemed to have just the right amount of running time so that you don't get tired of watching it.

If there is a flaw with the movie I would say that it is focusing on the gun blazing battles too much (although I personally didn't mind). I also highly suspect some historical inaccuracies although my knowledge of the James-Younger gang is limited so I cannot say for sure.

Overall, I am not much of a western movie lover but I loved this movie and recommend it for all. In my own situation my wife and I watched it with some friends of ours and every single one of us enjoyed the movie and rarely does that happen.",1167609600,2,1739,4.388198757763975
1652270,5,B00005QWAI,"American Outlaws is set in post-civil war Missouri in which the War Between the States is over and Jesse James, his brother Frank and their cousin Cole Younger migrate home to find out their home-town of Liberty is Union-occupied territory where, if identified, ex-Confederate soldiers (like them) are executed.

Worst part of all, a corrupt railroad baron is coercing farmers in Liberty to sell their land to his railroad company at ridiculously low prices. Those that refuse to sell have their houses condemned by the U.S. Interior Department and the occupants subsequently kicked out by Federal troops.

The James household is paid a visit by the plutocrat's representatives but Frank and Jesse give them their walking papers. Only later is the James house paid a visit by Alan Pinkerton's henchmen and the results are not pretty.

The James-Younger gang is then formed to take the fight to the railroad President and Liberty's Federat occupiers. When the James-Younger gang is formed, this movie only gets better.

Despite this film's Historical inaccuracies, I liked it because of the good acting, humor, well-written script and decent music score. Prior to seeing it I thought it was going to be a copy of Young Guns. But it certainly isn't that at all and it keeps you interested the entire time.

The movie is made for entertainment and it certainly delivers!

Yes, the actors' lines are kind of dumb in some parts (only SOME parts!!) and Ali Larter is not the best actress, and sometimes Colin Farrell forgets he's not supposed to be Irish in this movie and Scott Caan still sounds too much like he's not out of high school yet- but hey it's not all that bad.  There's a good plot and lots of humour and good fight scenes.  If you're not a super overly critical and picky person you'll find yourself a decent movie that's entertaining and has a good ending.

The Younger farm was in Lee's Summit, MO and the James farm was in Kearney, MO definitely more than a days ride by horse between the two. Other than that it is a story told by the southerners and southern sympathizers from the north. This is definitely the story we didn't hear in the yankee schools of the north. If you're looking for a cool western with the look and feel of the civil war and young america in missouri, then this is for you. My favorite was Gabriel Macht, who portrayed Frank James.

1652284,4,B00005QWAI,"The incredibly gifted Colin Farrell once again pulls a good one: an Irishman playing Jesse James.  But give the guy credit:  he does a very good job, although not up to par to some of his other work (Recruit, Hart's War, Tigerland).  Obviously not a fact-based work, AMERICAN OUTLAWS, under the astute direction of Les Mayfield, nonetheless is an entertaining western, filled with anachronistic dialogue and music, but also filled with heart, humor and adventure in mind.  In this version, Jesse and his brother Frank (well envisioned by Gabriel Macht) and his cousins, the Youngers (Scott Caan, Will McCormack and Gregory Smith) are fighting in the Civil War where we get to see Frank's expert shooting and Jesse's wildass courage and outright idiocy!  The war is now over so everyone returns home to find that the railroad companies are forcing farmers to sell them their land.  Kathy Bates in a brief but memorable turn plays the James mother, and when she is killed by Pinkerton detectives, the boys take matters into their own.
Wayfield plays the gang as a Robin Hood, with typical jealousy on the part of Caan's Cole Younger.  Timothy Dalton as Pinkerton seems James Bondish in his delivery and Harris Yulin pumps up the ham to play the dastardly railroad owner.
All in all, the film is as entertaining as it needs to be and even though Jesse and gang are almost beatified, they still have a little of that bad boy in them to make it believable, even though it's not!!!",1085270400,3,1475,4.76078431372549

Right from the starting scene in a civil war battlefield and on to the end, the thrills never stop. It'll have you sitting on the edge of your chair or jumping up and down in excitement all the way through!
Farrell is an excellant Jesse (and very handsome too!), set off well by Scott Caan's equally brilliant Cole Younger. When Frank and Jesse James Return to Liberty, Missouri after the civil war, they find things greatly changed. The railroad is heading West and it needs their land. Jesse and Frank refuse to sell and create a spread of rebellion throughout their village. After seeing their Ma brutally murdered by the railroad men, the James brothers join forces with the Youngers and begin careers as outlaws in order to stop the railroad's advance.
The film does have a slightly romantic edge in the form of Zie, Jesse's beautiful fiancee (Ali Larter).
American Outlaws is equal to Pirates of the Caribbean for excitement, yet being shorter it doesn't even drag in the slightest. Infact, its only fault has to be that it lacks a Jack Sparrow, but with Bob Younger's wisecracks you scarcely notice it.
If, like me, you lost your heart to the West long ago you'd be a fool to miss this film. Even if you ain't lost your heart to nobody, you'd still be a fool.

It was only a few minutes into it so I got a pretty good idea of what it was about. This is supposed to be a historical fiction, duh. Which if you're not smart enough to know what it means and think that it means that everything in it is accurate and totally true you're wrong. It means that some things are true and some aren't. So ofcourse there was a gang called ""The James Younger Gang"". Of course the director isn't going to use the actual names so that means that they're going to change it around a bit and same with the movie. All the actors in it are great. The only thing that doesn't make it that realistic is the teeth. I mean it was a great movie but come on! If this is back in the 1800's how did they keep their teeth so white? But all the actors did a great job. Colin Farrel did an excellent job. And as always Gregory Smith was very cute and hot in this movie. This movie has a mix of all types, except horror really unless you think hanging people is considered horror, but not for this kind of movie. When I was watching it I was so into it that I didn't move the entire time. And when is came down to the crying parts I was crying before I knew what would happen next. On the DVD the behind the scenes are very interesting to watch also. And the commentary explains a lot about the movie. And why some things are the way their supposed to be for those of you who were to blind to see that it's supposed to be historical fiction which i may add once more means that things aren't always going to be accurate.

1652292,3,B00005QWAI,"I must immediately say that this film is a whole lot of fun. The actors are young, cute, talented, and obviously having a great time. Colin Farrell and Gabriel Macht have clearly captured the spirit of the James brothers; Scott Caan has his father's looks, charm and very good handle on the boldness and ruthlessness of Cole Younger; Will McCormack is a scene-stealing comic, and Ali Larter is--well, she's very pretty. The show is helped out immeasurably by veterans Timothy Dalton and Kathy Bates. (Bates would have been an even more natural choice for the James boys' mother if the part had been written closer to history, which it wasn't.) There are some wonderful action/adventure Indiana Jones-y stunts and the pace of the film is brisk. It's a Saturday afternoon kind of movie--fun, good-looking,and not mentally taxing.
My problem was that I bought the film to give me some insight into the history of the James Gang, and if you are looking for reality, this isn't it. It's a combination of half-truth, made-up-out-of-whole-cloth falsehood, and so many anachronisms we lost count. Anachronisms can be charming--as ""A Knight's Tale"" illustrates so well-- and part of the movie's charm is the 21st century Saved-by-the-Bell language that these kids bring to their roles as famous desperadoes. If you know anything about the James Gang, the Civil War, or the history of western expansion, parts of this movie will drive you crazy. A partial list:
1. The opening scene takes place during the last days of the Civil War with Frank James taking out a Gatling Gun with his sharpshooter's Winchester rifle, a' la' Sergeant York. Gatling guns were not used in the Civil War (except as a test case), and Frank's Winchester is an 1880's invention.
2. Cole Younger was never about to be hanged by Federals and so the James boys didn't free him from the gallows, but it IS a great scene to watch.
3. Most of the climactic scenes involve Jesse's escape from captivity. Jesse James was never captured. He was shot in the back of the head at his home by a former gang member for reward money.
4. Mrs. James (her name was Zerelda Samuel) was not killed by the Pinkerton Raid. She lost an arm but lived well into old age. However, not mentioned by the movie was that her 8-year-old son Archie Samuel, the James boys' half-brother, was killed in the raid.
5. Jim Younger wasn't shot dead as a teenager after some bank job--he killed himself in his 50's after he was paroled from prison.
6. Pinkerton never saw the James Boys in person, but directed the hunt for them from Chicago.
7. In the film, Nathaniel Arcand brings ethnic diversity to the Gang as ""Commanche Tom,"" but I can't find a record of anyone named Tom in the James Gang and no one who was obviously Native American. I think his role was just a token; if you have ""cowboys"" you have to have an ""Indian"" too.
8. Ali Larter was just precious, but her loose flowing Breck-girl hair and Gap-style gauzy clothing were anachronistic. And the idea the she led a raid to free (the never-imprisoned-in-the-first-place) Jesse, guns blazing, is totally out of character for her or most women of the age. The directors DID manage to present ""ladies of the evening"" as something less than Hollywood-beautiful, which is probably closer to the truth, however.
Enjoy this film. It is meant to be enjoyed. Just don't take any of it seriously.",1059177600,5,3377,4.744897959183674
1652293,2,B00005QWAI,"Jesse Woodson James, one of the titular ""outlaws,"" is taken up again as the hero of another Western movie, with Colin Farrell.  (If you are interested in other Jesse James film, see ""The Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid.)  After the Civil War, Jesse, his brother Frank (Gabriel Macht) and Cole Younger (Scott Caan) formed a group to attack the railroad company which, according to the film, relentlessly buys up the land of the farmers (two dollars for one acre).  Some say Jesse and Cole are American heroes.
The film is right in giving us simple settting, ignoring some historical truths; but the film also ignores our reaction to countless actions that lead us nowhere in particular, like the script of 1994 Drew Barrymore film ""Bad Girls.""  (Well, the poster was good.)  The railroad company led by Harris Yulin and Terry O'Quinn is jsut a bunch of risible, one-dimentional, old-fashioned villains who are there to be despised.  Even Timothy Dalton who plays Allan Pinkerton looks theatrical, not because of his acting, but because of the character's illogical response.  You expect from Pinkerton some smart scheme to catch the group.  No.  His 'plan' is little better than the one found in hackneyed TV episode of some detective drama.
But what is most disappointing is the acting of the cast.  Collin Farrell doesn't seem to be interested in the role, nor other actors except very few (I mean hot shot Gregory Smith and humorous Will McCormack).  You cannot distinguish one from another, and if one of them is gunned down, it is shown in a most balnd way so that we don't care.  Probably that has something to do with the hot climate of Texas where the film was shot.  But in ""Tigerland"" in which humid air is easily felt, Colin Farrell was fantastic.  Here he is not.
Two actresses appear: Ali Larter as Jesse's love Zee Mimms (who really married Jesse), and Kathy Bates as Jesse's mother (who really didn't meet the same fate as the film shows).  And I don't know why they should be here, giving awful dialogues, doing just unmemorable roles.  And you know it's Kathy Bates; it is amazing that she is unmemorable and gives awful dialogues.
What you see in this movie is just another fast-paced, action-packed Hollywood movie about guns and explosions.  The film never stops, thanks to the director Les Mayfield (""Flubber"" and ""Blue Streak""), and like these films he doesn't show any originality.  Not a good entertainment, this film doesn't serve as a text for learning history either.",1058400000,3,2494,4.855791962174941
1652294,3,B00005QWAI,"This is not a movie I would recommend to traditionalists among the Western movie audience. People whose formative movie going years were spent watching Westerns starring the likes of Wayne,Scott,Cooper and Eastwood-actors with weathered faces and an air of hard won experience that suggested a life lived hard and well-will find the parade of twenty something pretty boys and girls ,with sun bed tans and expensive LA dentistry ,a little hard to swallow. By the same token there is no pretence of authenticity in either the historical facts or the actual look of the movie which is bright ,clean and just too ""modern ""for an authentic Western
It is in short a Western aimed at the MTV audience which demands action ,rapid cross cutting and a certain flippancy in the dialogue and plot development.
It purports to tell the story of the James-Younger gang whose career we trace from the closing days of the Civil War ,through their return home to discover the railroad is seeking to take over their farms ,to their subsequent career as train and bank robbers as they wage war agianst the railroad interests and the Pinkerton men sent to track them down. It stops short of the final chapter in the life of its hero Jesse James-maybe the audience cant handle tragedy.
Take it for what it is -an action movie for the teen audience,one which it just so happens is a Western ,and you may well enjoy it .Ask for something a little more -like logical plot developments,authenticity and an air of versimilitude,and you will not  be satisfied
The cast are all perfectly competent actors but for the most part simply do not LOOK right for their roles .They never suggest the kind of people they are playing -young people who worked hard on the land,saw violent and bloody action in a vicious war and then tirned killers. It is a sanitised portarit of the decade and its main participants and best enjoyed with one's critical faculties anaesthetised.
Lots of lively action and a brisk running time help while veteran players Kathy Bates -as Mrs James ,and Timothy Dalton as a symapthetic Pinkerton -steal acting honours .
I would gladly see more of the youthful leads but preferably not in a Western -they simply lack the faces and demeanour to do well in this specialised genre",1058140800,,2265,4.778061224489796

1652298,1,B00005QWAI,"The tale of infamous outlaws Jesse and Frank James receives a severe dumbing-down by Hollywood in a lame attempt to create a new millenium YOUNG GUNS. AMERICAN OUTLAWS will appeal only to braindead youths in the 11-14 aged bracket (I know. I used to be one). It's sad to see Kathy Bates reduced to acting in this (She's good, as usual). The real American Outlaws here are the film makers. Someone ought to tar and feather those yellow-bellied freeloaders. The dialogue is terrible (""Sadie was a beautiful woman, Sadie was not a man"". ""She had a mustache. A nice mustache"") and the movie is not worth the price of the videotape its printed on.
The back of the video (in Aus/NZ at least) says: ""This is one wild ride where the young guns rock the establishment with originality and attitude"".

1652299,4,B00005QWAI,"There aren't too many new Westerns out lately, and when they do come along, they're often jewels (i.e. Tombstone, Maverick). While not a great aid for a history class, American Outlaws is a fun, action-packed ride with a great cast.
The film stars the surprisingly talented Colin Farrel, an Irishman with a great American accent, as Jesse James, the infamous outlaw. He does a wonderful job with the character, turning a ruthless outlaw into a very likeable guy. Along Jesse is his brother, and his cousins, all of whom are very good in their roles. Most notably is Will McCormack as Bob Younger, quite possibly the funniest character of any Western. His issues with being the forgettable gang member made me laugh for a long time.
If you're looking for action, this movie is wonderful. The shootouts, fights, and even Civil War scenes are quite spectacular, although somewhat unbelievable (a character runs alongside a train shooting in the windows, you have to see it). I must warn you - Check your brain at the door. Its much more fun that way.
This brings me to my only gripe - the historical inaccuracies. I am a history buff, and while the film is close to the true story of the James-Younger Gang, the subtle differences bug me a bit. The biggest being the Gatling Gun the Union soldiers use. The Gatling gun wasn't invented during the Civil War, but came along during the time of Custer.
All in all, American Outlaws delivers a great ride that picks you up from the first second and doesn't let go. If you don't want a history lesson, but a rough and tumble good time with plenty of shooting and the occasional hilarious moment, pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.",1039737600,,1681,4.6632996632996635

The Jameses and the Youngers were part of outlaw raiding parties against Northern towns during the Civil War and murdered people during their bank robberies. If you want to make a fun, fictional movie, use fictional names.
 I don't have a quarrel with the reviewers that said they knew the plot was fiction, but liked the movie for its entertainment or good-looking cast. That's your choice. But when reviews say that Colin Farrell ""is completely believable as Jesse,"" that ""the history of Jesse, Frank, and Jim were accurate,"" or the movie ""shows the motivation and the reasoning behind the famous outlaw gang,"" I feel like I'm watching auditions for ""Street Smarts.""
  The movie tells you that the James-Younger gang was heroically fighting oppression by the railroads. In truth, they were thieves and murderers. If you want to see what the gang did to people--including shooting a father going to the aid of his fallen son-- ...
  It's wrong to make cold-blooded killers out as heroes just for the sake of a few box office dollars, whether it was 10 years ago or 130 years ago. To those that say ""historical accuracy is a moot point,"" that may be your opinion, but it's certainly not mine.",1038700800,4,1253,4.782407407407407

1652303,3,B00005QWAI,"""American Outlaws"" is a fun Western action flick if you don't get hung up on authenticity.  In this version of the Jesse James story, the gang, led by Colin Farrell as Jesse James and Scott Caan as Cole Younger resorts to bank and train robbery when the railroad seeks to buy up their families' farms for a pittance.  The James-Younger Gang is portrayed as 19th century merrymen who prefer to avoid murder when possible and who donate a portion of their proceeds back to the communities.  The long list of murders attributed to the gang is downplayed.
The movie combines some creative escapes and rescues and some excellent equestrian scenes with a good mix of humor.  Wanted posters provide a continuing source of laughs as early robbery victims fail to recognize the boys from their poorly drawn posters, and later, one of the Younger brothers tries to stand out more during a robbery so that people will remember what he looks like because he's frustrated by the poor likeness that appears on his wanted poster.  Kathy Bates as the Ma James makes some very funny comments about being proud of her boys for being good Christians and killing Yankees.
Authenticity, however, has gone out the window in many areas: costuming, historical accuracy, dialogue, music.  Although James didn't marry his sweetheart Zee Mimms until 1874, in ""American Outlaws"" James appears to leave the gang to marry not so many years after the Civil War....
The costuming for Mimms (Ali Larter) is glaringly awful.  Although she would look great in accurate period clothes and hairstyles, the film makers seemed to opt for attire from the nearest country-western shop--perhaps to maximize her ""hot babe"" appeal.  Other characters, such as Bates, get more authentic costumes.
The music also seemed to be selected to appear to teens and twentysomethings rather than to reflect an accurate 1860s sound.  This musical direction struck me as ironic considering that ""Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou"" has renewed interest in traditional bluegrass music, which has its roots in the era featured in ""American Outlaws,"" and the 19th century song ""Minstral Boy"" has been heard recently in ""Black Hawk Down"" and on commercials.
As for dialogue, although the James gang doesn't run around addressing each other as ""Hey, Dude,"" the language still sounds too modern for the period.
So, overall, great action and funny moments throughout make this an entertaining but inauthentic movie.

I didn't believe them so I watched it at the movies and I was amazed at this movie. The costumes are very cool and the sets are amazing. One set they used twice for two different cities. Ali Larter, Colin Farrell and the rest of the cast play magnificent roles. I would recomend this great movie to anyone because it makes you feel like a outlaw.

I like the movie itself because it doesn't just go into the shoot em' that many modern day westerns do.  It shows the motivation and the reasoning behind the famous outlaw gang.  The DVD edition is great because of the special features, it talks about each of the actors learning how to ride, spin guns and shoot.

I hate romance but the connection between Colin Farrell (Jesse James) and Ali Larter (Zerelda) was adorable.  I wish I was Jesse's wife because he is gorgoeus!  I guess one reason I liked this movie was because of Colin's amazingly good looks. LOL! I highly recommend this movie to anyone.

1652312,1,B00005QWAI,"I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Colin Farrel, and he does a decent job playing Jesse James, even if he does occasionally lapse into his thick Irish brogue.  However, I was very disappointed in the movie as a whole.  Jesse and his older brother Frank, join forces with three of the Younger brothers to fight against the railroad that is taking over farms in their native Missouri.  After their farm is raided and their mother (played very broadly by Kathy Bates) is killed, they go on a rampage of bank robberies, stealing from the railroad to shut it down.  The young actors are likeable enough in their roles, but the dialogue is not realistic at all and relies too heavily on weak humor during the bank robberies.  I admitedly chuckled a few times, but more often groaned at the lack of realism.  The gunfights are mildly interesting but again are too unrealistic.  Finally, the beautiful Ali Larter is completely wrong as Jesse's love interest.  She is much too comtemporary and seems lost in her role.  A shame that all this talent is wasted.  Fans of Colin Farrel would be better off getting ""Tigerland"" and western fans should check out ""The Wild Bunch,"" which has some of the same elements as ""American Outlaws.""",1026691200,4,1225,4.655813953488372

It's a terrific movie, that takes you on a wild and hilarious ride with Jesse James and his gang. All the actors are well-cast and did a great job portraying their characters, although - in my mind - Colin Farrell (the next big thing!) and Ali Larter (Hollywood's most underrated actress) do stand out among the others! If you are looking for a history lesson - go to the library. But if you are looking for a fun movie with lots of action, a great cast, good script, a bit of romance, and some truly unforgettable moments, then don't miss out on ""American Outlaws""!!! It's become one of my all-time favorite movies! Plus, the DVD has really great bonus features ... trailers, tv spots, photo galleries, DVD Rom features, and 4 great featurettes - check out ""How to be an Outlaw"" for some nice shots of the guys in cowboy camp ... showing off their muscles during what would later be know as the hottest summer in Texas' history :o)",1026604800,26,1040,4.566844919786096

The James Bros then come out of retirement to rob a large northern bank to exact revenge for their mother and dead stepbrother. Now I find that much more compelling than this drivel.

1652317,2,B00005QWAI,"American Outlaws is easy on the eyes thanks to its two gorgeous stars, Colin Farrell and Ali Larter, but your brain will be sorry...and if you expect an iota of emotional connection, you should look elsewhere.
Most of American Outlaws plays like a really, really pale imitation of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  But without the cracklin' William Goldman script and the Newman/Redford star power, all is futile.  Scott Caan's performance is as expressive as a thick slice of white bread and maybe half as flavourful.  Farrell is charming at spots, but this screen version of Jesse James is so bland, so wholesomely American hero-like, that there's no emotional attachment to be found (discredit once again to the embarrassingly simplistic script).  Larter is one of the most beautiful actresses her age and her feistiness and sex appeal are terrific (witness her small part in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and, more prominently, Final Destination), but she fits into this Western setting as oil fits in water.  And to director Les Mayfield:  How about giving our ""hero"" a hard time once in a while?  When somebody gets shot in this movie, they either recover within two sequences (generally about a minute's screen time), or die peacefully.  When Jesse James is captured, they give him such an easy time it's a wonder why they bother.
I made it through most of this movie without having to use the search function on my DVD player, so I guess there's a vague sense of interest there.  But this is an awfully weak way to segue the Western genre into the 21st Century.  Hell, even Young Guns was more fun.",1024876800,5,1610,4.7797833935018055

The filmmakers set out to create a light-hearted adventure with an emphasis on fun, and that's exactly what ""American Outlaws"" is all about. Fun. Historical inaccuracy is a moot point. The legends of Jesse James and his gang are little more than a jumping off point for the finest action/comedy combo of 2001.",1019001600,2,661,4.963963963963964

1652321,1,B00005QWAI,"I'll be honest with you, I didn't watch this entire movie. About 40 minutes into it, I had to walk away. I just couldn't take anymore. This movie is nothing more than a vapid action cliche built around the newest group of fresh faces in Hollywood. It is an atrocity to the genre of the Western, and offers no historical value whatsoever.
I am a big action movie fan. But it takes a little more than a piece of fluff like this to gain my attention. In the short amount I watched, I could tell the direction it was headed. The youngest of the Younger brothers twirling his gun around and behind his back and re-holstering it to prove he was old enough to fight the government agents come to rob his family of it's land is just one example of the lame quality of this movie.
I grew up in the day when the Western still had some clout. Clint Eastwood is my idea of the perfect Western hero, right along with his protrayal in A Fistful Of Dollars. That is the standard to which I hold all Westerns I watch, and this one doesn't even come close.
Some action fans might enjoy this movie, but it's sad that the Western has degenerated to this. I'd reccomend something from the good old days of the Western. Each time Hollywood does a new Western, I cross my fingers, but find only more drivel like this delivered. My biggest fear is that my children will really think this is how the Old West was. The director stated in the extras he wanted to expound upon the Jesse James myth, but to me, he merely road roughshod over it with this glazed donut of a movie.",1016323200,3,1550,4.275510204081633

How can Colin Farrell ride into the middle of a battle, shoot 30 union guys before they even realize it, and then get away because the northern guys are so dumb they only aim at the ground near his feet?  I guess the way this movie is, maybe Jesse James is like Achilles and has been dipped in some sort of magic pond protecting him.  I never knew Jesse James was such a nice guy, either, who only robbed banks from the evil railroad company.  Never knew that the railroad company hanged people who wouldn't sell them their land (when the government was really giving them land).

Tombstone and Young Guns were possibly prettier and more accurate as to location (Young Guns was at least partially filmed in New Mexico, the state where Billy the Kid did operate, while American Outlaws, set mostly in Missouri, was filmed in Texas)but this movie is not really too bad. It stretches history to the breaking point in several places and has characters doing things the real persons likely never did but it is obviously meant to be for fun, and the younger viewing market.

I'll never understand how some movies go forward into the production process without first having a story to tell??  After watching AMERICAN OUTLAWS, it made me wonder if the producers even researched the James/Younger Gang?  Did they visit their local library?  Did they interview any of the existing family members to come up with some cool antidotes?  Or did they just decide it was time for a western.  Then they sat in their carpeted Hollywood offices, threw together a cliche' riddled script in a couple of weeks, gathered up a handful of young good-looking newcomers and went to work.  I BET MY MONEY ON THE LATTER.
The script was horrible!  No emotional build-up.  No sub-plots.  Absolutely zero realism.  Test-audiences probably didn't like the first viewing, so they started chopping.
Oh, how HOLLYWOOD has changed.
The only good thing to come from this is that the performances weren't bad.  They just had nothing to work with.  They made the best of a lousy thing.  I give high marks to Gabriel Macht.

1652332,4,B00005QWAI,"The ghost of John Newman Edwards must have had a hand in writing the script. The movie is pure legend, with not a shred of history allowed to intrude. I liked it. It worked because they didn't try to play it too seriously. This was the flaw in the Rob Lowe/Bill Paxton movie ""Frank and Jesse""--they tried to make us take their hopeless mangling of history seriously.
  ""American Outlaws"" played it for fun, adventure, and legend. It covers only a single year time span during which time they seem to have robbed every bank in Missouri. Busy boys. The gang was also a sensitive, nurturing gang to the lesser-known members (funny scene).
  I can't possibly list all the diversions from actual history they made as they barely ever drifted even close to reality. Cole Younger would have hated the movie--they had him portrayed as the dumb guy. Frank was the smart one, and Jesse, of course, was the cute, dangerous one. The Irish guy who played Jesse did a good job. He didn't sound like he was trying to overcome an Irish accent, did a good, flat American, but he didn't really sound like anyone from Missouri either. He almost miraculously managed to always have that ever-so-manly two-day growth of beard ala Miami Vice.
  The setting was the film's biggest weakness--it looked much more like California than Missouri. Way too brown and dry, wrong kinds of trees. The town of Liberty looked like a generic Hollywood western town set, not at all right.
  So, I recommend ""American Outlaws"" as a fun action movie, _not_ as history. They did use the perils to returning Rebels pretty well at first but soon lost that to the whole purely fictional railroad plotline. Don't expect anything like ""Ride With the Devil"" out of this (though there is a nifty battle scene at the beginning).",1006646400,5,1780,4.719354838709678

It's the story of ""tradition vs. progress.""  Following the Civil War, James and friends returned home to the farm where the ""big bad"" railroad was trying to expand west by buying out all the farmland from the people in its path.  The people of James' town did not want to go quietly so a huge war begins between the farmers (with James and friends as their warriors) and the railroad tycoon when the railroad ""goons"" begin to rough up the townsfolk.
Overall, though there are a few historical inaccuracies, the movie is a fun action romp (tons of humor) through the old west with cowboys, LOTS of gun battles, stage coach robberies, train robberies, saloons, horses and lovely southern belles.

- TONS of shoot outs/gun battles (on trains, banks, battlefields, etc)
- Daring escapes
- Hilarity with wanted posters
Overall, this was a great movie to catch, harkening back to the days of the good old Westerns.  The action was solid and the humor was ""just right.""  This was a solid way to spend an evening (or afternoon).

1652342,5,B00005QWAI,"American Outlaws has a sizlin' cast led by Colin Farrell.  Farrell -- ""Where did he come from anyway?"" is probably what a lot of people are asking about weekend 1 of the movie's release -- is so fun to watch.  The farmboys turned soldiers are pressed into a battle against the railroad to keep their family homes and farms.  Watch for the line, ""Oh lol, he's smilin' again,"" it signals that you are about to get what you came to the theater for.
The story is nicely filmed: crisp, clear, moving images; the acters are strong, lean, and incredibly fun to watch; they leave you wanting more.  The general attitude is gregarious and fresh and very entertaining.
As so many know, Jesse James and fellow outlaws met a less than happy ending.  There is only the slightest hint that the ride may end, but. . . it doesn't; just a little tease that it might.  Fortunately for us, the film doesn't tell the whole story; otherwise we'd have another dreadful dark little drama on our hands.  Whewwww!  Glad we missed that.  The ending is very satisfying; even slightly surprizing.
Go see it, buy it, and enjoy it!  It's a keeper.",998092800,,1117,4.54
1652343,3,B00005QWAI,"The newest version of the James gang is a slow too modrate pace movie. Once again because a half star is not a opption I rounded up. The biggest problem with this movie is the historical flaws: 1. Jesse's mother losses a arm not her life. Imedately after  the raid.  2.  Jesse an olympic Gyminist? 3. Jesse changed his name too Mr. Howard in hopes of avoiding reproccusions of his crimes. The Author of this movie leaves that fact out. 4. The movie gives a happpily everafter feel. These are just a few historical no-no's. What is good about this movie it shows a  tension between respected allies. Jesse &Cole Younger at odds over leadership among other things. The man hired too catch the James gang doesnot conform well too what the railroad wants him too do.(?)other possible no-nos. The story  :It starts with the James & Younger boys in there final battle with the Yankee army:Under there rebal comander Quatrel. On the road home they find outthe war is over. They return home ,Only too findout  that the railroad brought legal rights too run ranchers off thereland,In order too put up a west bound railroad. The James -Younger Gang -beging there life  of crime ;When Jesse sprear heads the rescuing of Cole Younger from a nose(?).Then the Railroad company bombs the farms the James'mother is a victem. Let the bank,stage,and railroad robbing begin. To stop the gang the railroad hires the first under cover agence(pinkertin).From here the movie moves on with moretalk then fight. Like so many rocky movies we see a flow of event highlights. One robbery thatis focused on is the botched bank robbery .Pinkertin ambushes the Gang via a false news add. The gang suffers a small loseupon escaping(?).With that job finshed Jesse &Frank leave the gang. Cole Younger becomes the sole commander. Jesse then confess his love too his cousin zelda ,pays offthe prist and is married. Later the happy couple is on a beach(?).Where did that beach coem from in the middle of the west?Anyway Mr. Pikertin just happens along to intrupt the couples swim. Jesse is put on a train too Washinton too be tried. Here comes the big finish .With acrobatics that might impress Jackie Chan -Jesse escapes custody. Frank & Zelda James have also railed the entire county and commadeared a cannon too boot. The rescue was a success but our outlaw hero didn't need help. Before the gang departs Pickertin dropes a hint too move too Tenesse(?).Like so many 50's westerns they ride off into the sunset .",998006400,,2477,4.7733644859813085

7951334,5,B00005QWAI,"This film about the exploits of the James and the Younger brothers is very different than the many other films about the gang. It has action in it, but more than action, it has lots of humor, usually the result of how Jesse acts with his cousin Cole Younger and how the entire gang acts during robberies. It is also designed to show Jesse James as a very likeable, even charming man, who loved a woman and wanted to live peaceably with her.
The film starts with the Union soldiers ambushing the Confederate soldiers among whom are the James and Younger brothers. Jesse performs a daring act of charging the entire Union force alone on horseback. After winning the battle, the Confederates continue on their way and discover that on the very day of the battle, Lee surrendered and the war was over. They decide to go home and live in peace. Unfortunately, they did not find peace.
The Railroad wanted to buy up all the land upon which the James and Youngers and lots of their neighbors lived so that they can run the railroad tracks though their land. When the railroad tried to take the land belonging to the Youngers, Cole Younger killed a man. Cole Younger is captured and about to be hanged and Jesse again performs an extravagant act that saves his cousin, leading eight men against the union army. When the James family refused the railroad people burned their house and killed the James boys mother. They and the Younger brothers decide to get revenge by stealing railroad money, with the film suggesting that it was only railroad money they were stealing.",1517356800,,1562,4.64259927797834

This young cast played off well each other, Colin Farrell, Scott Caan,
Ali Larter and the supporting cast were just great. I've seen many versions
of the Jesse James gang but none that I continued cheering throughout.
These young people kept me glued to the screen and wondering what was
going to happen next. Now there was one character who totally surprised
me, like a sleeper and that was Ali Larter. I give her an that-a-girl.",1517184000,,506,4.633333333333334
