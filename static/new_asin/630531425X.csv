It shows us his life as a child, teens, and young adult. It shows us that Tiger was always been discriminated all his life. He had to fight so hard just to get to what he wanted to do with his life. It also shows us that he is shown as a Black Man by the media, but he himself has always says he is not just Black but Asian as well. I liked it.",1316649600,,490,3.8613861386138613

This man has amassed over a half of billion dollars since he has joined the tour and is revered as a worldwide mentor and super power. Tiger has put his size 12 in the behinds of all naysayers including Jack Nicklaus himself who stated that black people could never advance in the game of game golf. It's funny because white supremesists insist that caucasion people are the supreme race when in fact they are mutated albinos. Golf is a very difficult game to master

mentally and physically. Tiger has crushed all of the black inferority theories and proved that the color of your skin means nothing more than that. We are all equal in the eyes of God and should be measured by our good will and love towards others. This movie is great and explains all of Tigers trials and tribulations in his quest to be the most successful golfer ever and bring all races together:-)",1138838400,3,1054,4.43298969072165

7887474,2,630531425X,"I'm writing this review to let the world know that this movie isn't quite as bad as the other reviewers have said.  It is definately hokey.  With the exception of Keith David playing Earl Woods, the movie is pretty badly acted.  It has a very made-for-tv movie quality, which isn't surprising since it was made for Showtime.
It does provide a pretty basic insight into Tiger's life up until the '97 masters.  Its an easy and light movie to watch.
Please note, I didn't shell out any money for this tape - it was just shown on Showtime.  I think I wouldn't pay more than $5.00 for this movie.",1019865600,,591,4.385321100917431
7887475,1,630531425X,"This was not a good movie.  I didn't like anything about it and I thought that it would be at least half way decent due to the price.  One day I left it in the VCR when I went to work and my wife watched it.  When I came home she was laughing histerically.  I asked her why, she said the movie was so funny because it was so bad.  In the film, Monty isn't even fat, that's how funny it is.  If you're rich, like golf, and want a laugh, then get this terrible movie.  Otherwise, stay the hell away.  Save your money for a hooker in Times Square.  LOL.",1006732800,2,550,3.8828828828828827
7887476,1,630531425X,"I've never seen a sicker movie.  The attempts to act out Tigers life are ill and they would make any golf lover vile.  It is dull, boring, terribly fake and laughable.  It doesn't even feel right when you watch it.  It's as if you're watching bologna.  And you'd probably be better off staring at a blank wall....  Monty didn't even have a beer gut or nothing.  And his accent was some kind of Pakistany/French!  The whole time Faldo's face made it look like his undies were too tight.  I'm not kidding, this was one of the worse stinkin movies I've ever seen.  And look how much it costs!",971568000,3,589,4.37037037037037
7887477,1,630531425X,"Some films are so bad they're good, and this feeble effort qualifies with  flying colours.  Not only is a biopic of this sporting icon absurdly  premature, the narrative is a hotch potch of journalistic speculation and  third hand supposition.  Allied with some appalling acting and the most  risible sporting recreations since Michael Caine donned a soccer shirt in  ""Escape To Victory"", this ludicrous film will have you laughing  until your guts split.
The film starts badly, chronicling Tiger's  childhood filled with his father's portentous Forrest Gump style spouting.  However, it is not until the toothsome lad handles a golf club for the  first time that the quality truly starts to deteriorate.  Clearly strapped  for cash, the makers decamped to the nearest municipal to film the golf  scenes, and thus we witness a ball unconvincingly wobbling its way across  grass that might be Augusta, but more closely resembles a patch of rocky  scrubland on the side of a Welsh mountain.  Even this, however, is  surpassed by the array of golfing talent portrayed in useless fashion by  the best of America's Z list thesps.  Nick Faldo [complete with Cockney  accent] is one of those being extremely poorly imitated; the biggest laugh  of the night, though, is the man playing Colin Montgomerie who has none of  the gravitas and weight to pull off a character as substantial as Monty.  What he lacks in bulk the actor makes up for in hair, sporting a massive  blond affro, and accent: Monty's gentle Scottish burr removed and replaced  by a hilarious composite of international languages closer to Delhi than  Dundee.
In short, this film could have picked up every Oscar from  ""Least Convincing Portrayal of a Scotsman"" to ""Most  Unwittingly Humorous Recreation of a Winning Putt"", and should receive  the derision and recognition that it richly deserves as a consequence.",968112000,3,1873,5.065789473684211
