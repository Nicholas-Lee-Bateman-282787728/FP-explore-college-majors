Despite it's absolutely shoe-string budget, it is far, far more interesting, intelligent and well put together than most B-movies and leagues above Sy-Fy channel tripe. I've seen all of Mr. Zuccon's Lovecraftian films and I enjoyed them for what they are. Let's face it, if filmed literally, Lovecraft's work would look incredibly stupid on film. Close your eyes an picture a big green cgi Cthulhu. In my opinion the use of Lovecraftian themes make for much better films than cgi monsters. I like Mr. Zuccon's work and I'd love to see what he could do with a real budget. This film has it's flaws but I respect the effort and creativity that went into it. I've seen far worse mainstream, big budget films.",1273536000,,725,4.716535433070866
7994021,1,B00009XN4V,"A horror film, filmed on video (NO BUDGET), WITH SUBTITLES. Do you need any more details?

I tried watching this mess, its unwatchable. This is the worst thing that I have seen in years, as bad as one of those awful ""Brain Damage"" films.

Don't bother wasting your time on this shipwreck of a film.",1098316800,,298,4.4
