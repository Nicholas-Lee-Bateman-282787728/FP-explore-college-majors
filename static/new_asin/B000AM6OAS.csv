8078859,5,B000AM6OAS,"To pick up where the Pokemon ""Advanced"" Season left off, ""Advanced Challenge"" offers Pokemon fans more exciting adventures, featuring Ash, Pikachu, Brock, May, and Max! Plus, any DVD that features five episodes or more, in my book, is a winner. :)

Here are some comments and observations I had, regarding each of the episodes:

""Candid Camerupt!:"" Interesting how Vito meets up with Team Rocket and explains his story to them instead of the heroes, which makes for an amusing plot twist ... Usually, Ash and his friends are the ones who are approached whenever a guest character has a personal story to tell them. What happens after Camerupt is hit in the face is just wild! I feel bad for Max after his battle is over. :( James' remark about Vito's family not being at home is hilarious: ""Unless they're very tiny!""

""I Feel Skitty!:"" When it comes to Eliza, Brock goes more ""girl crazy"" than usual ... Brock: ""I could use a 'Pick-Me-Up' too, please!"" Max: ""Hey! I think a 'Calm-You-Down' would work a lot better!"" Brock: ""Eliza!"" :) We also get to see one of the few occasions where Meowth shows a kind side towards another Pokemon (Ex: ""Fly Me To The Moon"") as he attempts to keep Skitty away from Jessie!

""Zigzag Zangoose!:"" Ash producing a Seviper costume out of nowhere was hysterical! Love Meowth's remarks following a classic moment: ""That was awesome! From now on I'll fill in for Jessie, OK?"" Hilarious fight over Pikachu featuring the heroes and villains struggling against one another in a cloud of dust!

""Maxxed Out!:"" It's a hoot to hear all of the characters laughing at Jessie's hair, including James! The heroes ""Blasting Off"" at the end of Act One was a riot! Jessie acts like Frankenstein when she emerges from the water ... ""Give me the Surskit!"" The Nurse Joy in this episode seems to take Brock's compliments well, for a change!

""Pros and Con Artists:"" Good moral message from Grace about ""taking shortcuts,"" in this episode. Check out Grace's expression after May mentions ""Beautiful Girl!"" :) The girl in the crowd who exclaims ""This Pokeblock must be incredible,"" looks and talks like Misty. :) A highlight of the episode included an awesome battle between Ash and Drew!

There is only one negative point to this DVD (This includes all of the DVD volumes for this Season of Pokemon) ... Under the ""Bonus Features"" menu, both the opening and closing themes are featured, yet they are already featured within each of the individual episodes, so to feature the exact same thing again, in a bonus feature, is redundant. However, this sort of thing doesn't really bother me as it might other fans of the Pokemon series who expect more from bonus features, and it doesn't take away from my overall rating on this release ... I just had to mention this to upcoming purchasers of the Pokemon ""Advanced Challenge"" series who have high expectations upon checking out the bonus features. Fortunately, there is a positive point to the ""Bonus Features"" section, and this includes brief descriptions of a couple of the upcoming ""Advanced Challenge"" episodes from future DVD releases ... That was nice. :)

*Before I close, note that there are a couple of differences between the opening and closing themes of ""Advanced Challenge"" ... In the intro, there is footage of Drew and Roselia, but during the ending sequence, the footage is replaced by a shot of Professor Oak, Ash's Mother, and Tracy. Also, the tail-end of the closing theme features a far-off image of the heroes, with each character facing in a different direction. Usually, in Seasons past, the Pokemon ending themes are edited versions of the opening themes, but on this occasion, there are some subtle differences between the two! :)

In closing, I have to say that everyone who contributed in making the Pokemon episodes and the DVD sets did a fantastic job! :) Thanks for reading! God Bless...
