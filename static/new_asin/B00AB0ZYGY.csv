8549490,4,B00AB0ZYGY,This DVD is the necessary companion volume to the DVD Relax Into Stretch if you want to use the DVDs as training support for the book Relax Into Stretch: Instant Flexibilty,1453680000,,172,4.580645161290323
8549491,5,B00AB0ZYGY,"It was nice, I already had the book for sometime but seeing it done on screen was very helpful, not to mention I find him amusing.  He says ""Comrad"" in his Russian accent a lot and the phrase ""tighten up.....releasssse"" and now every time I'm stretching I hear him in my head which I find helpful, even motivating.  I like it. Definitely have been seeing improvement and I always thought of myself as one of those people who just didn't have it when it came to flexibility.  My goal is the splits and this DVD is definitely my core routine.",1444262400,3,540,4.38
8549492,5,B00AB0ZYGY,"The instructor is somewhat bizarre and weird, but the technique seems interesting and effective. I have no doubt that I'll significantly increase my flexibility following this technique.",1426723200,2,186,5.925925925925926

8549494,3,B00AB0ZYGY,"Overall I am very pleased with this video, however I do have a few criticsms of it in terms of the speed at which Pavel talks through the techniques, and actually does the exercises. He also does not ensure that the audience has the body in the correct position ie by saying 'make sure that your head is upright, you are breathing in such and such a way' etc. very often
Also you will need to pause the video between exercises as he goes through everything so fast and only does one side of the body. By the time you have gotten yourself into the correct position he is about 2 exercises ahead of you!! This can be a bit irritating because you risk getting cold while you have to keep pausing the video player.
However this video does give great results and the technique really works. Personally after doing it my muscles felt great - much better than an ordinary workout.",999907200,14,873,4.395061728395062
