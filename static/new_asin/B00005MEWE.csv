7945240,4,B00005MEWE,"This is a verry funny movie that is irreverent towards several aspects of Mexican society. A satirical punch in the face of big business and its leaders and the corruption  power spawns. This movie is deserving of a review rather than an annonymous play on words. There is some good acting , especially by Fernando Lujan and Julietta Equrrola, both of whom won awards at the prestigious Guadalajara Film Festival 2000. The film also won Best Picture at the festival. They won best actor and actress for their performances as a married couple living in Mexico City. Fernando Lujan is Enrique aka William to his mistress Rita who is an aspiring rock star . Enrique is part of a company that is invloved in drug dealing  and money laundering while fronting as a distributor of milk for social programs. His wife Elena is always fantasizing in soap operas, seeing herself in various roles(she even dresses up as a super heroine) but is caught in an unhappy mariage. She gets wind of her husbands philandering via video tape and thinks it is joke until she meets the mistress. One of the funniest scenes is when she accidently drinks a  drug spiked litre of orange juice while listening to Rita's band and everything suddenly is lovely and the story takes an odd turn. There are also a couple of inept kidnappers who take Enrique in the meantime where a whole series of outrageous scenes develop. It is a movie that will make you laugh as no punches are held back when it somes to societies ills in the form of corruption, money laudering, infidelity, kidnapping, robbery and crooked business deals. It is  a farce of the highest order. There is much to see in this film as things are constantly happening away from the main action as muggers and car jackers go unnoticed and people nonchalantly go about their everyday business. The comedy of errors by the dim witted kinappers is hilarious  as is the persona of Enrique during his captor. Mexican rockera Julietta Venegas lends her talents to the musical soundtrack for some memorable tracks that Rita lip syncs. It is movie that is similar to other films from Mexico  like ""Todo El Poder"" and ""La Ley De Herodes."" Recommended for people who can laugh at Mexican culture, themselves and a good satirical look at modern society.",1047859200,12,2274,4.72979797979798
