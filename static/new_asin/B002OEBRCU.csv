8375983,4,B002OEBRCU,"Overall a great panel show because of Anthony and Eric.  But did they ask Gabrielle at the last minute? She really did not try to hide the fact that she hated being there, up to the point where she was checking her phone towards the end while her fellow panelists were talking.  I didn't care much for her self-absorbed, heavy handed book, so I'm not terribly surprised to find her so unappealing as a personality.",1417996800,,414,4.506666666666667
8375984,4,B002OEBRCU,"Anthony Bourdain's snarkyness
snarkyness can be pleasantly funny.",1407888000,,65,7.25
8375985,4,B002OEBRCU,Enjoyed it. Great to hear how they all started and what they learned from their chef mentors. Each one coming from a different angle.,1400198400,,133,4.583333333333333
8375986,5,B002OEBRCU,Terrific insight into the experiences of two fine and one outstanding chef.  The chefs explain how tough the food industry is and why they are still at it.  The narrator is excellent.,1396483200,,183,4.6875
8375987,5,B002OEBRCU,"Love Anthony! Really enjoyed watching this. The chefs are honest and funny. Anyone thinking about being a chef should watch this AND read their books, as it takes a special kind of person to be a chef.",1371945600,3,201,4.45945945945946
8375988,4,B002OEBRCU,"First, why only four stars?  I suppose that even if anyone realized it, there was nothing that could be done about it other than scrap the whole show, which was otherwise compelling.  What am I talking about?  Who?  Gabriella Hamilton, who apparently has a great back story about which I fully intend to learn more, was so distracting and distracted that she detracted from the experience for me.  Didn't her OCD mother teach her how to comport herself?  Goor grief, woman, leave your hair alone!  If your hands are visible, don't fidget with them!  She actually appeared to be only half aware most of the time.

Aside from that, the entire show was a blazingly informative, thought provocative hour ana a half uninterrupted by commercials..  It was a pleasure to hear the anecdotal experiences of these chefs, and the lessons learned from them.  Loved Gabrielle's ""fava missles"" story! (Don't ever put something on the menu that you haven't experimented with.).  Tony & Eric are apparently great pals, with very different backgrounds & temperaments, whose wealth of experience is shared openly...the good, the bad, etc.  Michael Ruhlman was every bit as good a moderator as James Lipton.

Recommed highly to anyone interested in the current ""foodie"" trends.",1365379200,2,1258,5.043689320388349
