8536854,2,B0096PBCUC,"This DVD could have spent the majority of its time capturing the musicians in the studio as they lay down tracks for ""9 Lives to Wonder."" Unfortunately, the majority of the 80 minutes is nothing more than random shots of the various band members standing around by themselves, making random comments, constantly and incessantly mugging for the camera, driving into town, and engaging in other completely musically-unrelated activities. There is also plenty of footage of someone's kid crawling on the floor and someone's dog following people around. The rest of it involves having the camera focused on one of the guys playing snippets of already-recorded tracks through a tape recorder. I really don't see the point of it. Again, this had so much potential. How great would it have been to see the actual recording sessions. We don't even see or hear Edward KaSpel singing. At most, he is in a few clips outside of the studio, smiling at the camera and wandering around aimlessly.",1369353600,7,981,4.951515151515151
8536855,4,B0096PBCUC,The sound is yummy and probably will please anybody who's a fan. I wish there were more things available along these lines... I love being a fly on the wall!,1357862400,2,157,4.266666666666667
