8590993,2,B00D9FSX34,"I probably would have given it three stars, because the acting was good and some parts of it were entertaining, but decided not to for the reasons below. Also, I can't comment on the quality of this video, since I watched it on vicki.com. However it is very boring in many places and is my third time in attempting to watch it. I finally skipped a couple episodes and it got interesting. When I went back to watching it from the beginning, I encountered the frustrating story-line again. That is, the evil characters, as well as the characters who let people abuse them, irritated me. And it was hard to watch the bucket loads of injustice going on throughout the series without taking breaks. They teased me with hope of something good happening to the lljamae character and then crushing it. It is difficult to watch evil characters getting away with their abuse on innocent people and animals. Those scenes took away any pleasure I had while watching it. If I had known it was like this, I probably wouldn't have started watching it, because I hate this kind of story. It was disappointing because I like watching Lee Joon Ki, Park Shi Hoo and some of the co-stars. On top of that, I'd like to kick the butts of the people who put dog fighting in the film. If that really happened just for this drama, then it makes for a sorry excuse for a human being. They are as big of a jerk as the jerks in the story.",1489795200,,1409,4.402298850574713

8590995,1,B00D9FSX34,"The English grammar sucks, really, really sucks. Whom ever the translator is, have him or her deported to an English speaking country  and don't let him or her back on the main land until what comes out of his mouth is reasonable English or something that resembles the  god forsaken language that we inherited from the queen of England.  okay!",1425254400,,344,4.7
8590996,2,B00D9FSX34,the subtitles and spelling sucked.  it was hard to follow the story line because the gender kept changing males into females and vice versus.  The quality of the picture was good and the action was good...but the subtitles (in English anyway) were very poor.  Over all I would not recommend this particular DVD from this place.  Get it somewhere where they know English.,1407715200,,370,4.825396825396825
