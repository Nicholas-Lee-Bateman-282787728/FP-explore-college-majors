8104978,5,B000E371UK,I read this book because a relative of mine was in that battle. I did not know this until after he was deceased. He spent over 48 hours in the water being harrassed by sharks. I have read the book two times and I am now waiting for the book to be returned to me from another relative so that I may read it again. What very brave men!! And most of them were just kids compared to me. It gives you an insite into the people who made this a great nation.,1362182400,,451,3.860215053763441
8104979,1,B000E371UK,"This is last great Battleship engagement ever, and the last great Japanese thrust in WW2, therefore being not dissimilar in effect to the German Ardennes offensive.  A great Battle demands a great documentary.  In the mid-1990's very many excellent documentaries were coming out about WW2, especially concerning battles and technology, possibly because of the expiration of a ""50 Year Rule"".  But this was not one of them.  Produced slightly later than many of the first, around the year 2000 (if I recollect  accurately), this opens with a scene of the narrator in a handsome library giving the introduction to the Battle, as if to add an air of erudition.

But the gentleman's comments (Mr. Edmund Herrman) are introductory and rather vapid; perfunctory in a word.  When the film turns to the description of the Sea Battle itself, here the comments quickly become too obtuse, and far too detailed, without sufficient reference to maps.  For such an expansive and large battle as this, constant, detailed map referencing is essential.  The narrator throughout this spews out various commander's names (of generals, ships, forces, etc.), combined with technical geographical terms, to produce a meaningless blizzard of information that leaves all but the experienced bewildered.  This combined with a lack of map reference makes this film exactly what it set out to be: a perfunctory nod to one of the great Battleship engagements of all time, and merely that.

The expert commentary is rather mediocre, and sometimes it is hard to hear even what they are saying, as with the elder Mr. Potter. (...) This is a redoing of an older review of mine, and though initially some of my comments were slightly confused, upon reviewing, I have made corrections.  My final ranking on the film, however, remains the same at 1 star.  It was a half hearted attempt at a documentary, an attempt to cash in, on the recent release of information, and the contemporary love for war time films.  One therefore to steer clear of.",1340236800,5,2009,4.993993993993994
8104980,5,B000E371UK,"I have seen documentaries of the Leyte Gulf Battle in several collections, such as `War In The Pacific"", ""The World At War"", and ""Victory At Sea"". But I found the coverage of this battle not sufficient. Thus, I got this documentary. The great value of this presentation is in the narration of events and their relevance. The video is actually of medium  to low quality, and nothing new or special.
It starts with meaningful background information leading to the Leyte landings. Then it explains in detail and context the naval battle. Not just what happen, but why and how it affected the action.
For example; I did not know the Japanese mistaken a pre-invasion action in the north flank for an invasion of Formosa, and implemented the wrong defense plan, sho-2 , before the actual Leyte landings. This lead to their  premature lose of hundreds of planes, and compromised their defense plan Sho-1.
Just about the only issue not well addressed is Admiral Halsey's reasons for leaving Leyte Gulf  unprotected while chasing the Japanese decoy force.",1268006400,8,1046,4.931818181818182
