Somehow this movie was striking.
That is why I want to get it.",1245196800,2,104,3.5652173913043477
8454153,4,B0052SO088,"This is a essentially a remake of Anthony Mann's classic T-Men, updated for late 60's London. Think, Out Of The Past as compared to its remake, Against All Odds. Although The File of The Golden Goose follows the original [T-Men] much more closely in regards to both plot/structure as well as the dialogue. Overall, worth watching if you are a fan of the original and/or of Yul Brynner. What I find to be odd though, is that nowhere does it state that this is a remake - not on the disc's case nor in any reviews that I've seen. And, since the writers of the film were both of the same generation as Mann and have writen some of the finest noirs of all time, it is odd that they wouldn't call this what it is - a remake (because it is well beyond an homage). In fact, one of the writers, John Higgins, wrote T-Men, thus making the ommission a bit odder, still. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable film and the Kino Lorber Blu-ray/print is terrific. Enjoy.",1522281600,,950,4.342696629213483

The appearance of phony hundred dollar bills has the US Department of the Treasury very concerned.  The source appears to be somewhere in Europe, and agent Novak is dispatched to England, to replace an agent who has been murdered.  In cooperation with Scotland Yard, Novak and police detective Arthur Thompson (Edward Woodward) go undercover posing as members of the ""Golden Goose"" gang, robbers who are on the run.

They manage to infiltrate an underworld organization involved in the distribution of the bogus US currency, but when the pair fall under suspicion, Novak splits from Thompson, and continues the investigation from a different angle.  Novak eventually makes contact with Nick ""the Owl"" Harrison (Charles Gray), a flamboyant underworld figure, involved in the distribution of the phony bills, and attempts to broker a deal with the organization that is printing the money, and identify the leader of the operation.

Those who appreciate Brynner's hard boiled tough guy persona, will probably enjoy this gritty crime drama, where survival depends on successfully carrying out a number of bold deceptions.  Brynner is a little stiff, but seems to fit into the British setting well enough, with the supporting cast doing a good job, particularly Charles Gray (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diamonds-Are-Forever/dp/B009NUTPAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diamonds Are Forever</a>), and Edward Woodward (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Equalizer/dp/B000YENUOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Equalizer</a>).
