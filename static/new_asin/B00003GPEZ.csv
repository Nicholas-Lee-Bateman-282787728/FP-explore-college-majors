1329604,4,B00003GPEZ,"The first time I saw this movie I wasn't sure about it. After watching it many times since I find that I really like this movie. I have read books about Grey Owl, and I am glad the movie did not focus on Grey Owls battle with alcohol. It would have diminished the character. I thought this was a romantic movie that I enjoy watching over and over. As for Pierce Brosnans portayal of Grey Owl, excellent!!! This was quite a stretch for Mr Brosnan. I think his Bond, Remington Steele and Thomas Crown roles are pretty much in character for him. I think he had to work hard at this role and I feel he did an excellent job. I loved it when he showed the softer side of Grey Owl, I just fell in love with that character. Pierce looks good with long hair, or short hair, he would probably even look good bald. The man is #1 in my book. I did feel that the role of Anahareo could have been done better. I have never seen Annie Galipeau in anything befor. She is beautiful but this role was not for her. I agree with another review that her acting went from sometimes good to sometimes, well lets just say it was hard to watch. I don't think she complemented Pierce, the chemistry was not there. I feel sorry for Mr Brosnan because from what I have read he put his heart into this movie, and the movie industry thumbed their nose at the movie. If a movie is good it does't need sex and violenc to enhance it. This was a good movie that can stand its own. Lets hear it for Grey Owl and <Pierce Brosnan>.",988761600,6,1494,4.13745704467354
1329605,3,B00003GPEZ,"I am very fimiliar with the story of Grey Owl as I grew up in Northern Ontario not far from Chapleau, where Grey Owl lived at one point in his life.
It was a average documentary about the Ojibway guide and trapper  in the 1920s Canada. Grey Owl aka Archie is different from his fellow  Indians - he is well versed, educated, and a brillant writer. Grey Owl  eventually becomes a voice for the mindless exploitation of wild places and  animals. Only until he goes to England does his past come back to haunt  him.
I agree with the other reviewer that Richard Attenborough decided  too ""clean up"" Grey Owl's image. Grey Owl is a very important  part of Canadian history and conservation, however the movie could of been  done better....",958867200,2,734,4.549618320610687
1329606,5,B00003GPEZ,"Grey Owl is a wonderful film that makes you laugh and makes you cry by showing both humor and deep emotion. The star of the film, Pierce Brosnan, is a great actor with wonderful talent and comedic timing as well as his  co-star Ann Gilpeau. Pierce has succeeded not only as a marvelous actor,  but as a great producer also. As producer AND star of the film ""Grey  Owl"" I think he did a more than wonderful job (as always) and if you  haven't seen Pierce in much or if you are a fan I suggest you see this  movie. It really is a touching story.",955843200,9,543,4.084905660377358
1329607,5,B00003GPEZ,"Why Pierce Brosnan does not get the salaries of the Carey's, Cruise's and Sandler's is still a mystery to me. While one may not picture Mr. Brosnan as a Native Indian, one cannot help but be marvelled by his incredibly  believable performance.  I was thoroughly absorbed right from the start of  this magnificently written, directed and acted movie.  Bravo to Pierce  Brosnan and let's get him into more widely released pictures.  The public  awaits!",954115200,6,450,5.0
1329608,5,B00003GPEZ,"Pure poetry in motion is Richard Attenborough's GREY OWL, a beatifully acted and filmed true account story.  Although some may consider Pierce Brosnan an aquired taste, here he taps into the talent he displayed years  ago in an early John McTiernan film - NOMADS.  Not only does Brosnan rely  on the 'less is more' fundamentals - he also seems to color the character  of Archie Grey Owl(a man with a past) with a pathos seldom seen by todays  top box office male stars.  As for Attenborough's direction - it to is  careful, deliberate and completely poetic.  As he did in CHAPLIN,  Attenborough incorporates vintage footage into the story to create a  perfect 'true story' feel.  The Canadian backdrop is filmed with a glorious  reverence. Nothing is pompous or 'lugubrious' about this film, as another  reviewer stated.  Instead, the thrust of this picture is one of heartfelt  grandure -- told with a very delicate hand with extremely convincing  performances all around.  Sure there is a subplot - but it takes the viewer  on a journey with the character and provides ample emotion and tension.  Annie Galipeau plays a young modern native Canadian, who sees in Archie a  chance to connect to ancient roots and feelings. She brings to her  character a sense of passion for things only known as legend and provides a  soothing metaphor for Brosnans hiddeness and angst. A scene involving Grey  Owl and the elders of several Indian Nations hits with such force it  invokes emotion not seen much in todays multi-plex market. Although this  film seems to have gone straight to the shelves -- it seems far more worthy  of a big screen outing than so many other lesser and far more cliched  efforts.",952560000,28,1695,4.811846689895471

1329649,1,B00003GPEZ,"I can't remember when I've been so bored by a movie. Which is too bad, because it is based on a good story with historical significance. Saving the beavers was a huge conservationist achievement. But the acting is flat, there is no chemistry between the main characters, or any of the characters, for that matter. I gave it a good hour to give it a chance but between the sappy acting and unimaginative direction, I had to give up. I thought about giving 2 stars for history and pretty scenery. But no. I just can't. Ugh.",1513555200,,521,4.4375
1329650,5,B00003GPEZ,"I personally enjoyed the movie. Because I'm a big fan of learning more about Native American culture and history, although this movie plays more like a documentary. There is not any action involved, it's more of a drama to explain the true story of this man named gray owl who took it upon himself the way of living with Native Americans and how a woman who he came to love help change him into a conservationist. It was a very subtle and heartfelt movie. I am saddened to see news articles that call him an imposter. what I got from this movie is that the message is greater than the messenger. Though he may not have been native blood, he did pay honor and tribute to them and their Heritage and their ways, anyhow I enjoyed this movie. If you're into another Native American movie I recommend the movie Thunderheart with Val Kilmer, that's a really great one. Ill admit this movie did get kind of sappy at time because the female lead was constantly sobbing, but it was still a great movie",1511222400,,992,4.426229508196721

1329657,3,B00003GPEZ,"This movie got high ratings and I liked the topic.  What I didn't like and why I didn't last more than 20 minutes was because I could not stand watching the character as he made the motions of killing animals.  I know they were not harmed and it was all acted, but, I love animals too much to continue watching.  I grew up with a father and brothers who would hunt and we would eat the meet, however, I never went with them, because again i love them too much!  As my father aged, he spent many hours just watching the same animals he used to hunt and truly enjoyed it until he was too ill to continue.",1498262400,,602,4.076271186440678
1329658,4,B00003GPEZ,Good story about one of the first Indian -Wanna- be's.....,1498262400,,58,4.9
1329659,4,B00003GPEZ,"Released is 1999 and directed by Richard Attenborough, ""Grey Owl stars Pierce Brosnan as the real-life Archibald Belaney, known as Grey Owl. Claiming partial aboriginal American ancestry, Grey Owl lived as a fur trapper in Temagami, Ontario. Upon meeting the winsome civilized Mohawk, Gertrude Bernard, aka Pony (Annie Galipeau), he delved more seriously into writing and became a renowned conservationist in the early 1930s.

Grey Owl is the farthest thing from a conventional Western and could more aptly be described as a Wilderness Drama/Romance. People keep claiming that Belaney lived in Northern Ontario when Temagami Island and Bear Island are decidedly in Southern Ontario, about 200 miles north of Toronto. Simply being North of Toronto doesnt make it Northern Ontario. As far as Brosnan goes, he is actually very fitting for the eponymous role because (1.) Belaney had a similar build/look and (2.) Belaney was at best half-British (the ending clears this up).

Someone claimed that the truth about Belaney wasn't discovered until after his death from pneumonia in 1938, his body weakened by habitual alcoholism. No, stories about his dubious identity had been circulating for years and, as shown in the movie, the North Bay Nugget held on to the revelatory story for three years before his death out of respect for the mans conservationist work, which the newspaper promptly printed after his decease.

In any case, to enjoy this film you have to be in the mode for a low-key drama Western with lots of romance. If not, youll likely be bored to death. I found the first half rather dull, but the movie made up for it by Brosnans stalwart depiction, Galipeaus unique beauty, the magnificent eastern Canada cinematography and the cute baby beavers. The second half, however, becomes more compelling, as the truth about Belaney is slowly revealed. Unfortunately, the movie fails to include two important points about Grey Owl: (1.) Belaneys known alcoholism and (2.) the fact that his wonderful relationship with Gertrude (as illustrated in the move, that is) ended roughly two years before his death.

The film runs 118 minutes and was shot in Quebec (Chelsea & Wakefield) & Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, as well as Hastings, East Sussex, England. The script was written by William Nicholson.

1329668,5,B00003GPEZ,"Okay at first I was not impressed with Pierced Brosnan playing the part of Archie/Grey Owl but as the movie progressed I understood why.
Archie truly was a man ahead of his time and his message is even MORE important today than it was back then.
I wish Archie would still be alive to carry his message today. I wish he could be every they are trying to drill the oil out of our precious earth, or digging it up to find minerals -- not for the good of our LAND but to make the GREEDY RICHER. I wish he could have been in North Dakota helping the indigenous people protest against the pipeline people there, I wish he could have been in All the other places to prevent the ravaging our our forest lands, and mountains.  He may have not been born a native American/Canadian but he was one in his heart and he grew into it because he cared for the people that other people only see as $$$$ signs. That is why this movie is special and Pierce Brosnan  did that part very well. If you care about our nature no matter where you live, this movie is worth seeing.",1494201600,11,1054,4.187192118226601
1329669,5,B00003GPEZ,"This is based on the true story of Archie Grey Owl who spoke about the preservation and protection of the beaver and trees in the wilderness. He learned the Indian language and how to live in the wild. Trapping and hunting in his early years, he made his living. Then he started writing and giving speeches about saving the land. Though it is filmed in 1999, I found the story compelling and his life inspirational. I believe the script could be better but the acting was superb. It had a peaceful feeling. The scenery was beautifully shot. The lifestyle harsh. An excellent film for those seeking to promote conservation. Grey Owl had the spirit of the American Indian, I only wish more of us did.",1493856000,,698,4.592
1329670,2,B00003GPEZ,"Why they chose Pierce Brosnam to make this movie??? His performance is terrible. Annie Galipeau's character developed from a teenager complaining with her ""sugar daddy"", to a ""try too hard to be"" mature counseling girlfriend. It didn't work. Sitting at the theater's balcony, while Brosnam gave his ""finale"" speech, Galipeau's expression didn't help the amplified soundtrack of the scene. Landscape scenarios, though beautiful, weren't explored by the cameras. Flat characters were thiner than pancakes. Wrong actors, bad acting, bad directing. Five stars to the real Grey Owl and the beavers. Two star for the girl, she will recover.",1493769600,,634,5.479591836734694

1330343,5,B00003GPEZ,"Brosnan was good, controlled into the role. The co-star was equally into her role. The plot of this based on a true story movie was very interesting and really was inspiring that at early stages of the century people seemed to be more concerned about the environment and than currently. A good movie and it should be shown in the public school system to reinforce the need for conservation and preservation.",1482278400,3,407,4.746478873239437

1330369,5,B00003GPEZ,"A white British man grew up reading about and dreaming about American Indians living in the wild and off the land.  At the age of seventeen, he hopped a ship to Canada and began to dress and live like an Indian.  He became close friends with the chief of one of the tribes and was given the name, Grey Owl.  When asked about his ancestry, he would claim one parent as Scottish and the other as Apache.  Sometimes, he would confuse which parent was which.  He lived by hunting and trapping.  Eventually, he became close with an Indian girl who he married.  He developed strong feelings against trapping and killing beavers and began giving talks on the subject.  Interested people encouraged him to write a book about his life and his feelings about beavers, which he thought were becoming extinct.  When he completed his book, it became very popular, and he was encouraged to go to England to publicize the book and give talks on his environmental concerns.  A couple of years after he returned to his wife in Canada, he died of pneumonia.",1482192000,12,1039,4.5978260869565215

I enjoyed all of the cinematography, and how the beavers were captured in the film. The key female role played by his love interest was done with great chemistry between them. She was a refreshing beauty. I am glad to have found this little gem to watch. I am glad that it was based on a historical figure, who had much to say about our world and what we are doing to it.

At first I was surprised that Pierce Brosnan  was playing this role.....but he did an awesome job and it was very enjoyable. I have to say this was not a typical western, nor was it a typical roll for Pierce Brosnan.....yet the story line grows on you and keeps your attention. The scenery was beautiful, and relaxing. The music score/soundtrack was also so fitting and perfect. This has a romantic side and is historic as well. Takes you back to another era. It was so well rounded in all aspects and that is why I rate it a 5.  This is a good movie to watch by yourself (male or female) or with your loved one or family. A nice change of pace from the busy hectic world we live in today and a nice piece of history.",1480291200,,826,4.188679245283019

 And he was a white man . But any real Skin will tell you, it's how you live and how you THINK that makes you an Indian.

It is a wonderful movie, no gratuitous sex, 4 letter words, killing, raping, robbing, none of those, just pure telling of a true story it is taken from.

1330707,5,B00003GPEZ,The Movie Grey Owl is easily one of my favorite movies. I have worked as a conservationist all of my life so I was already familiar with the actual story. As a Mohawk Native American myself I thought Annie Galipeau was excellent as a Native American woman and did justice to the real life wife of Grey Owl. I thought Pierce Brosnan was really excellent in this role. Very few negative reviewers seemed to understand the actual impact of the real Grey Owl story or of the difficulty of making documentary movies. I have been both a scientist and had a role in documentary movies and it is a lot more difficult than most imagine. I know almost every woman I have ever known has loved this movie. Comments have been made about it not being filled with action and danger. Having been in these settings and a combat veteran I am somewhat puzzled and disappointed in such reactions. There is lots of action from the far north and the real story and old film clips are beautifully woven in. The scenery is lovely. I highly recommend this movie.,1365120000,,1037,4.492063492063492

After seeing this film for the first time, I was curious about this man I had never heard of, so I read a biography and was amazed to find out that not only was Pierce Brosnan a good look alike, but there was a lot of reality to the film, such as the knife throwing, which I had chalked up to Hollywood. The collector's edition also had some origonal footage of Greyowl as well as some behind the scenes. I can't recomend this film enough.",1322438400,4,658,4.491666666666666

The almost astonishing lack of concern and awareness of the life essential connections between ALL humans and things that mostly are labelled as environmental and/or ecological, appears to foretell a premature extinction of the increasingly ""brain dead"" human species.  For anyone with an open mind and intelligent concern for the present, highly confused and disordered state of contemporary human civilization, whose DVD film library does not ALREADY contain this most excellent and essential film, I would suggest acting ASAP to acquire one of the apparently last remaining, available copies.",1236988800,3,818,5.642276422764228

and very well done. Best of all was the animal actors, those beavers. Amazing creatures and so loveable in this show. I first saw this through Netflix about 3 months ago and I was so impressed I ordered a copy of this movie and after 3 tries finally received it.
I also ordered 3 of Archie's (Grey Owl) books which I have enjoyed very much. I plan to order more when I can afford them later on. Anyway, I loved it and I bet you will too.
BTW, Pierce Brosnan and Anne Galipeau are exceptional in this movie. Rated PG so generally safe for kids, except for the simulated killing of a trapped fox and one shot of Pierce's nude behind and one minor bedroom scene it is as clean as new fallen snow...",1229731200,7,748,4.201388888888889

1330727,4,B00003GPEZ,"Seems to me that this movie does a creditable job with a difficult subject:  Grey Owl (aka Archie Belaney).

That Attenborough undertook the telling is a tribute to him.

Annie Gallipeau is too beautiful to describe and is a perfect fit for the Mohawk woman Annahareo.

Perhaps the movie is a little glossy: for instance, it doesn't mention Archie Belaney's four other wives.  An untidy fact.  Nor do I recall seeing anything about his excessive drinking.",1162771200,2,455,4.921052631578948
1330728,5,B00003GPEZ,"I must admit that when I first saw this DVD jacket at a video store I scoffed at it.  Pierce Brosnan play an Native American?  Yeah, right.  Last night I was just about to go to bed and this movie came on.  I said to myself, I've got to see this.  As I watched I became intrigued by the subtle hint that something was amiss about the Grey Owl character.  It was very late at night, but I was not sleepy because this movie is incredible.

This is a moving story based on the actual life of Archibald Stansfeld Belaney.  It is very well acted, written and directed.  If you know nothing about the life of Archie Grey Owl, you will be amazed.  There are some scenes in this movie that are very touching and powerful.  For example, when Pony falls through the ice and Grey Owl rescues her.  Also, when Grey Owl tells Pony his secret, her reaction is heart warming and powerful.  To reveal too much about the story line is to spoil the film for someone unfamiliar with the life of a very interesting man.

I watch a lot of movies and this one is really very good; and certainly worth the $8.99 asking price, in my opinion.  As for the DVD, I do not have it.  Based on the other reviews, there are 2 10 minute inteviews with the real Grey Owl; and to me, this is enough to purchase the DVD.",1142121600,38,1284,4.158536585365853

 The film makers squeeze every ounce of drama out of Grey Owl's life.  The dvd comes with a clutch of short interviews with cast and crew, a short ""On Location With"" video and, most delightfully, two 10-minutes films featuring the real Grey Owl, made in the 1930s.

  A pleasant enough film with some moving scenes between Galipeau and Brosnan, although non-environmentalists may ask what all the fuss is about..",1094860800,25,521,4.863636363636363
1330736,5,B00003GPEZ,"I rented this video on a whim; I'd never heard of Grey Owl and  had more than a little difficulty picturing Pierce Brosnan as a believable Indian. I was transfixed by the story of Grey Owl, and pleasantly surprised by Brosnan's excellent portrayal of this complicated but important figure in conservation. It's a movie I've since purchased, and one I enjoy every time I watch it. Having done a fair amount of reading of Grey Owl's works after my first viewing, I've learned this is a moderately accurate portrayal of a complicated figure. It doesn't reveal all of his warts, but the focus of this film is rightly not just Grey Owl as a person, but his conversion and ultimate contribution to conservation. The public has a tendency to view heroes (or anyone) in black and white terms, and is notoriously uni-dimensional in their views of such people. Grey Owl (ironically, given his name) suffered that same fate. It's a story well worth watching and watching again. The cinematography alone is a treat for the eyes.",1085356800,46,1016,4.7727272727272725

About time Gery Owl was reintroduced to the world!  As stated in other reviews Pierce was a little 1940's movie Indian but he did all right.  Essentially accurate it's difficult to tell a man's life in 2-3 hours.  Attenborough is good with biographies but Hollywood is not in the business of making historical documentaries; movie ""histories"" are good for peaking one's interest--then go out and read about it yourself!",1077321600,,558,5.0989010989010985
1330738,4,B00003GPEZ,"When I first sat down to watch GREY OWL, I thought to myself, ""You've got to be kidding. Pierce Brosnan as an Indian?"". It didn't seem to fit. Of course, I grew up watching Brosnan as Remmington Steele so him in any role other than one of class seems out of place. However, as I was swept into the world of the movie, I actually began to believe that Brosnan was Grey Owl, aka Archie. He seemed a little different than other Native-Americans, but not so different that he seemed totally out of place.  By the time the movie ended and after I had done a little research about Grey Owl, I felt Brosnan had done a wonderful job and had been perfectly cast.
GREY OWL is a film directed by Sir Richard Attenborough and tells part of the story of Grey Owl, aka Archie, a Canadian Indian who began a conservation crusade to protect the native wildlife of Canada in the early twentieth century. However, Grey Owl has a secret that once revealed threatens everything he has fought to perserve.
The movie itself is engaging and has a great story to tell. It's filled with beautiful images of nature and has a strong message.  GREY OWL is a film that is often overlooked, but after watching it, I am reminded that not all gems sparkle like gold.",1077062400,9,1234,4.407894736842105
1330739,4,B00003GPEZ,"I didn't know much about the story of Grey Owl much less that this story was a true one! I just bought it since I'm so much into indiginous people's history and stories and this didn't disappoint in the least!
The story is a true one of an Englishman that moved to Canada at an early age and took on the role of a people he was fascinated with and becomes a trapper. He later grudgingly finds a special person who helps him strive to be more and he becomes one of our first environmentalists. I normally don't like to tell the story or give much away but I feel this is essential so you know what you are getting. In addition, many may wonder why in the heck Pierce Brosnan is playing the role of a Native American like I did!
The message is a great one and despite the deception, Grey Owl's story is an extraordinary one. The DVD is excellent as it has some historical film you can view of the real Grey Owl in the earlier part of the last century. That alone makes this DVD an exception purchase.
I wholeheartedly recommend it but cannot give 5 stars as I don't see it best in class for it's genre. However, it's among the better ones I've encountered for sure! It's an excellent addition to my DVD collection.",1053648000,6,1212,4.251082251082251

this movie leaves out some very important aspects in Belaney's life, but if your looking for the truth about Belaney, then there are other places you can go for that information.
its alright that he chose to become a conservationist, but did he have to represent himself as native to get his voice heard?
at the same time, i'm told that being native is a way of life.

Sad, because though it might not have been noticed in cinemas, Grey Owl is a well-made, well-told interesting story that is acted to perfection by Pierce Brosnan. This is one of those smaller films that really stays with you.
Grey Owl is based on an real-life story of a native guide in the Canadian wilderness. An early conservationist, he struggled to get the public's attention to the loss of many of Canada's wild animals such as the beaver. But Grey Owl had a secret that, when discovered, threatens to derail his crusade to save the native Canadians and the wilderness.
This movie is about all that and much more. Grey Owl is fascinating, complex person, and Brosnan's acting brings him to life incredibly well.  Don't miss it.",996969600,80,826,4.696551724137931

So be careful what one wishes and dream for as you will get it, it you keep dreaming it.
  He was not an Indian, but his dream was he wanted to be one, and he fulfilled his dream living off the land.  I am happy he quit trapping, and became a conservationist of the animals and forests.  God's creation is so beautiful and man is destroying it, so let us take a lesson from Grey Owl to protect our animals and their habitats as we cannot live long on this earth without them.
