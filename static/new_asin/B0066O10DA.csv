X'amd: Lost Memories

  What an odd anime, I really, really like X'amd, but no matter how hard I want to, I can't love it. What keeps X'amd from achieving true greatness, is its lack of development and explanation of the world of the story. For while there are many wars, governments, battles, and creatures, the show never takes the time to give you any substantial explanation for what any of them are, or why they are significant. As a result, it is always hard to feel for the characters, and the gravity of the situation they are in. The potential for true drama is wasted most of the time. Instead we're just expected to believe that war and hatred is bad, and peace and love is good. Unfortunately this is far from the first anime to have that message, and others have done it far better.
  This particular story of good and evil begins with Akiyuki, an average, everyday high school student. But the anime universe seldom allows average high school boys to average for very long, and by the end of the first episode, his island home is attacked, and his body becomes the host of a mysterious being known as a X'amd. He is then saved and spirited away by a mysterious girl who has all the answers (But never gives them to the audience), she takes him to the postal airship she lives on, and introduces him to the rag tag group who also occupy it, and who will be responsible for teaching him the life lessons he'll need to learn in order to overcome his status as average high school boy, and help save the world.
 It's a shame this story doesn't rise to become something unique, because it always feels it has the potential to do so, if someone would just explain what the heck a X'amd is, besides some sort of generic supernatural guardian of the world. Part of me wonders if this isn't drawing from some well-known piece of Japanese mythology, which would explain the lack of explanation. Sadly this is unacceptable as truly great stories should be universal, so there should have been some kind of explanation.
 What this series does have going for it is its lovable cast of characters (but what anime doesn't?). They must have meant something to me for I did shed a tear or two towards the end, not something that happens often, I just wish I had understand the situation more, maybe then I would have cared when one of the characters died, and why his sacrifice was significant. The animation for the show is also quite good. It must also be noted that the English dubbing of the show is superb (save for some brief cringe worthy lines from background characters), another example of how far English dubs have come in the past half decade.  Another high point is overall atmosphere of the show, which is extremely reminiscent of Princess Mononoke. It really does ultimately feel like this anime could take place in the same world as Mononoke only thousands of years later. Sadly X'amd's world is much more complicated then Mononoke's so the simple explanations don't suffice. And neither does the ambiguous ending. Though as far as ambiguous anime endings go, this one is pretty good.
 If you can watch this show for free on Netflix streaming or some other streaming service, I would definitely recommend it. Otherwise I would never suggest paying for Blu-Ray's or DVDs or digital downloads(I Especially wouldn't pay this $80 for the Blu Ray), without seeing the whole show first, and then deciding its something you always want to have with you.",1326758400,7,3473,4.632520325203252
4962598,3,B0066O10DA,This series is amazing and fun to watch.  But the series just throws you into the world with no explanation or understanding which takes time to understand what they are talking about or why things are happening.,1390867200,,212,4.72972972972973
4962599,5,B0066O10DA,"I really enjoyed this Anime.  Nothing off color, no nudity, or really bad language, and it was very enjoyable!  Thanks,  Mrs. Ann Z.",1390262400,2,132,4.6521739130434785
4962600,5,B0066O10DA,"This series is the most beautiful thing I've ever watched. As some have said, the progression of the story is unusual and can lead you in different directions. I believe it actually suits the story well. You don't get too focused on any one thing, or any one direction, going from start to finish, episode 1 to 26. It goes in directions that don't agree with going in sequence. You have to think, how can you tell a story with lots of simultaneous and cause-effect details without going on a tangent and circling back? This series makes a point through the character development that emphasizes near equal importance in all of them, so it has to bounce around. Nakiami makes a point to Akiyuki that he's the reason she is where she is at the end, and that goes for all the characters. It's not just about one or the other. That's why episode 26 shows spotlights each of their lives in the future.

You might not understand everything thats going on entirely the first time you watch it. The progression, and also the way that things are detailed are so subtle that they are easy to miss. You have to read between the lines and keep asking why to get to the soul of it. The more times you watch this series the more you learn about the point of it, and begin to really understand it. If you like animated stories that lay it all in front of you, sequentially, from start to finish, you likely won't enjoy.

It's still worth watching a dozen or more times.",1374537600,2,1454,4.401486988847584
4962601,4,B0066O10DA,I got this anime for the great reviews that insane and man they were right I haven't finished else the series but man I can't wait to see what happens next,1371513600,,155,4.032258064516129
4962602,5,B0066O10DA,This show has fantastic action and a well rounded plot yeah it get s alittle fuzzy plot wise because thyey're trying to show all these things happening to everyone else in the storyline but its still a great show.,1358294400,,213,4.487179487179487
4962603,4,B0066O10DA,"Others have covered the premise of this story, so I won't waste your time trying to reiterate.

Pros:
All the stuff that makes a good anime are here: artwork; character development; musical score; imaginative setting; interesting conflict; etc...

Cons:
Lots of stuff going on all over the place.  Not sure why some of the characters or plot lines were there, other than to be a parable of some sort.

Overall:
Loved it.  Every aspect is very high quality.  The effort is there.  The character development is excellent for some, if not for most of the characters.  This story is beautifully complex, but does sometimes feel crowded, like a diamond ring with too many gems in the setting (distracts from the centerpiece's beauty), or a wedding dress with too much lace (think snowbeast).  I can see why some reviewers said it was a little confusing at times.  I did have to see the last episode's scenes a couple of times to verify if it was a happy ending or not.  It was not immediately obvious, for me - which was mildly annoying.  Regardless, I was very pleased with this one, and will be adding it to my collection.  Just be aware you'll need to pay attention and possibly re-watch some scenes.",1346803200,3,1198,4.647619047619048
4962604,5,B0066O10DA,"Xam'd: Lost Memories has taken the top spot as my favorite anime series, or television series at all for that matter. It's set in a world apparently long at war. Neither faction is innocent, as is the case in reality but so rarely in literature. The people use a mix of futuristic bioengineering, modern weaponry, and religious ritual and magic to accomplish their goals. There are many factions, plotlines, characters, and ideas to understand and keep track of, and if you can follow all of them, it is very much worth the ride. This isn't a simple, straightforward story you can follow along with while you do your other work. It takes some effort to keep up with, and rewards that effort well.",1346544000,6,696,4.666666666666667
4962605,3,B0066O10DA,"Akiyuki Takehara is a high schooler living on the tranquil island of Sentan. He goes to school with his two best friends, Haru and Furuichi, and lives a relatively ordinary life. That all changes when he is accidentally involved in a bus bombing and is bestowed with the dubious power to transform into a strange creature called a Xam'd. The transformation is not without price however, as those that spend to much time in the Xam'd shape start to turn to stone. Saved by a young woman named Nakiami, Akiyuki is rather forcibly removed from his home and employed on a mail ship. Now he must learn to control his new power and try to find a way back home.

This series was weird. It was interesting, then boring, then confusing, then interesting, then confusing, then it ended. The world we are introduced to is interesting and mysterious. Akiyuki was something of an interesting character and he goes through quite a bit of character development. The supporting cast is varied and carry the story well.

I think the problem I had with the series was scale. There are two major plot lines. Akiyuki and Sentan Island. But within that we have multiple sub plot-lines. On Sentan, we have at least 3 different characters to follow, each doing something different. Akiyuki has his story as well as the task of explaining the world, the Xam'd, the Hiruko, and the war. The set up is all very promising, but they just couldn't fit everything in. They do try to wrap everything up, but it comes together in kind of a mess. It it would have been much more interesting if they had cut a few of the sub-plots and fleshed out the main story.

I was intrigued when I started. I was curious and interested. For about the first half. Not to say I wasn't entertained by the second half, and I sort of liked the ending, but all in all I felt like it was a good show that tried too much and suffered for it. But, hey, for under $50 you could just get it and try it for yourself. (or do what I did, and check your local library :)",1329350400,11,2010,4.412398921832884
4962606,5,B0066O10DA,"I was probably one of only a few customers who started watching Xam'd when it originally ""aired"" on the PlayStation Network.  At $5.99 per 20 minute episode to RENT (in HD), I am not sure many others stayed for the whole ride.  Those who did hang in there were rewarded with one of the most original and best animated series ever seen!

Others may complain that things are not explained thoroughly, or that certain aspects of the world were not explored.  Personally, I LOVE this about anime!  The Japanese don't feel it necessary to explain every last detail.  They throw you into this (very) weird world, and let you discover what is going on throughout the series.  I watched eagerly each week, not only to see the development of the characters, and to see how their story progressed, but to discover this strange world in which they live!  Each episode reveals a little more about the conflict that frames the story, and the motivations of the individual characters.  While I was left feeling that I did not totally understand the resolution at the end, I also feel that repeated viewings will give you a better appreciation for what is going on as well.  There are a LOT of subtle clues scattered about, and if you aren't paying attention, you will quickly find yourself lost!

This is a title that you DEFINITELY need to see on Blu-Ray!  I viewed it in 720p HD on the PSN, and I quickly found myself just STARING at the picture!  The colors are very vibrant, and the artwork is of a very high quality...so high that I found myself wondering just how they could achieve it on what must have been a very limited budget!  You usually will not find animation of this quality outside of a high profile theatrical release...to find it on a weekly series is rare, to say the least!

Likewise, the audio is very well done...there are plenty of explosions and other sound effects to get your blood pumping, and a GREAT intro song by ""The Boom Boom Satellites"" that will give your surround sound system a good workout!  The ending song is also quite good as well.  I am very anxious to hear how it sounds on Blu-Ray, because, while I cant remember, I believe the audio was limited to 2.0 Dolby Pro Logic on the PSN version.

All said and done, if you have ANY interest in anime, GET THIS SERIES!!!  It is well worth the price of admission!",1328486400,,2335,4.516666666666667
4962607,3,B0066O10DA,"This was one of the best anime series to come along in a while - imo. I watched it beginning to end in the space of a week. There was enough plot set-up to last at least three seasons but seems production was forced to encapsulate the whole thing into one, twent-six episode story arc. The characters are well-developed providing plenty of drama. It's a moralistic anti-war tale along the lines of Gundam - the only way to end war is to wage the ultimate war. If you love sci-fi and anime, you'll be hooked by Xam'd... think along the lines of Serenity meets Miyazaki (you'll definitely see his influence here). And like a lot of anime out there, it features an independent delivery service caught in the middle of it all. Finally, I have the same gripe as others. I wanted to absolutely love this series but couldn't. What kills it? THE FINAL ""Give the world a reason to smile"" EPISODE. I say watch the first 25 eps, and if you want all that the characters suffered through to have any kind of meaning in the end, beyond all temptation, do not watch that last episode.",1327276800,2,1069,4.431472081218274
8494152,5,B0066O10DA,I did purchase this through Amazon but in a collection one and collection two type-deal. The anime is great and the story is fulfilled and fulfilling.  Im not so sure why some people wrote  that they didn't understand the story. They need to go back and rewatch it because the story is complete and everything is explained well...  you just need to pay attention to the details.

The problem is some things just seem to happen and you don't get to know why, and I've heard that it has a lot of translation errors. Both of these things lead to a lot of whats going on here headscratcher moments.

The story involves war, religion, love, family, and crazy weird superpowers. Mix in a little bit of steampunk and Nausicaa (I hope I spelled that right, its a cool old anime) and you get this! have fun!",1399334400,,628,4.26890756302521
