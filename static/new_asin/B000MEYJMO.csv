8168224,5,B000MEYJMO,"The beauty of truth is that it is often right in front of us, beneath our feet, surrounding us in the air we breathe. It is we who, in the infinite ""wisdom"" of our intellect, have complicated and thus obfuscated the truth throughout our evolution.

That obfuscation would remain benign were it not for our proclivity for fearing that which we do not understand. In these troubled times, it is even more important that we reach out through study and understanding to those people and beliefs which we have yet to understand. I believe if we were to do that as a collective human body, we would begin to understand the true meaning of love. We would begin to re-understand the wonderful life that such love can lead us to live. I say ""re-understand"" because I believe we all knew that once, but along the way have lost the path.

Valeria's message (contained in her Priestess Of Osun - My Practice) is beautiful in its simplicity, in its mapping the way for us back to our roots.",1197849600,,977,4.5141242937853105
8168225,5,B000MEYJMO,"As a Yoruba woman and a newly initiated Osun Priestess, I was totally captivated by this DVD. I refused to exercise my right to pause or stop the DVD playing, but chose instead to hold all bathroom breaks until the documentary was over.

""Osun Priestess - My Practice,"" is an unabashed exposition (no pun intended) of Yeye Siju Osunyemi's personal understanding and application of her knowledge to the veneration of the Orisas.

Osunyemi's knowledge of various spiritual systems makes her Ifa expression quite eclectic, opening up a discuss on the present day practice of Ifa in America which may be made up of a combination of Ifa, Santeria, Vodou, and Zen meditation.

I would encourage both practitioners and non-believers to purchase and watch this DVD because there is definitely a lot to learn from it. The picture and sound qualities are excellent as are all her other Orisa DVDs. I hope to see Osunyemi's works on the big screen one day.",1197590400,3,945,4.857142857142857
8168226,5,B000MEYJMO,"In a world in which events seem to eclipse our abilities to comprehend and control, in which anything foreign or mysterious is regarded with disdain if not outright fear and anger, peace is an emphemerally elusive goal.

It is at times such as these that answers are most often found in the pure and simple; not in escalating the complexity of those things which confound us, but rather in returning to those intrinsic things we knew in ancient times.

The ""Priestess of Osun"" takes us to a simpler place, back to our common human roots that predate and transcend all contrived barriers, back to the underlying nature that not only comforts us but sustains us.

I found in this book both hope and insight, not only for myself but for all.

I found peace.",1197331200,,754,4.604477611940299
