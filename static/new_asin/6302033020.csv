418944,5,6302033020,"This is one of my favorite films of all time! I first saw it on television when I was twelve and was immediately captivated by Irons. The way he acted was so unusual, but delightful. Now eighteen, the film is even better than I remember. The film is quite artless. The only thing that could key one in that you're watching a movie was the scene where the door opens as the camera comes into Sunny's hospital room. Otherwise, the film never calls attention to itself. Irons is superb. Equal kudos go to the acting of Ron Silver (of whom I've only seen in the Kathryn Bigelow film 'Blue Steel') who isn't as peculiar as Irons, but Silver delivers an edge that never comes across as sanctimonious. This movie has a lot of details that I could mention, but I digress. The director of this film is Barbet Schroeder. Yeah, I was surprised that the guy who did ""Single White Female"" did this film, too. But he delivers the goods. This film is a docudrama, but it could exist as a film on its own without the real events. In any case, this film has a perfect balance of everything and I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves the director or Irons or docudramas or smart films or legal films. Put down whatever book you're reading and treat yourself to ""Reversal of Fortune"".",973382400,7,1270,4.431623931623932
418945,5,6302033020,"Brilliant; Irons was excellent, as was Close. Irons definitely deserved his Oscar. And Ron Silver! I'm surprised he wasn't nominated (of course, I suppose there are only so many spaces to fill in that regard). I did find  Closes's narration mildly irritating, but opinion aside, the film wouldn't  be what it is without it, and that is an original means of storytelling.",943401600,2,370,4.951612903225806
418946,4,6302033020,"This is a slyly clever adaptation of Alan Dershowitz' account of the retrial of Claus von Bulow. It features strong performances from Glenn Close, and Ron Silver as Dershowitz, and Barbet Schroeder won an Academy  Award nomination as Best Director. But in the end, this movie is all about  the portrayal of Claus von Bulow by Jeremy Irons, in an Oscar winning  performance. Irons is superbly ambiguous throughout, never allowing the  audience to finally settle its sympathies with his character.
Irons'  final line is typically enigmatic: ""Just kidding."" This movie is  well worth a look.",917136000,5,588,5.136842105263158

418988,4,6302033020,"This is a dramatization of lawyer Alan Dershowitz's (Ron Silver) attempt to prove that wealthy socialite Claus von Bulow (Jeremy Irons) was innocent of putting his wife, Sunny (Glenn Close), into a coma. While Close and Irons both do excellent jobs of depicting their marriage's downward spiral, this movie's main focus is the American legal system. Like what Spotlight does for journalism and what The Martian does for NASA, this one does the same kind of profession exploration, especially in regards to the arduous and morally complex process of defending the rich and famous. Dershowitz gives a strong defense as to why lawyers should do this, but thankfully, the movie is tasteful and mature enough to leave the answer to this dilemma as well as the one regarding Bulow's guilt up to the viewer.",1497830400,,800,4.977611940298507

419034,3,6302033020,"Reversal of Fortune provides an exciting investigative drama in which it is demonstrated how a defendant believed to be guilty even by his own lawyers can in fact be vindicated when much of the true facts are known. However, I subtract 1 star for a blatantly false and misleading characterization of another real case in the film and another for premising the film upon a false dilemma. We are asked in the film to understand defense attorney's Alan Dershowitz acceptance of the repugnant Bulow's case as in part to finance the defense of the ""innocent"" ""Johnson brothers"". The Johnson brothers, who are actually the Tison brothers, were anything but innocent. By their own account they were guilty as hell of felony murder, having actively assisted in the kidnapping of a family four who were subsequently murdered before their eyes by their co-conspirators, and whose deaths they apparently did not even protest. This is a far different painting of their case by the film, in which it was merely stated that they ""helped their father break out of jail"". Less important, but strange and perhaps telling, is that the film incorrectly stated that these brothers were ""black"". This mischaracterization I believe was part of an effort on the filmmakers to create the film as soon kind of false dilemma between being a good lawyer and doing justice. As the film fairly accarutely shows there in fact was little (non-fabricated) evidence that Claus Von Bulow was guilty of anything except not subjecting his drug abusing wife to an intervention before she killed herself through wildy bad eating habits and overdose of drugs and alcohol.",1460160000,2,1632,5.0036764705882355

He was, so obviously waiting, hoping she would die. His money got him off and the lawyers who got him off should put more help into victims - the kids had money- Victims have money too. Claus's famous attorney could have said ""NO"" and contacted the victims to say he could help keep the original decision. I think the majority of people around during this time knew Claus clearly wanted out of the marriage but not without the money. He was tired of Sunny, he wanted Alexander Isles. I watch it in the memory of Sunny and cringe and feel sorrow for her children. What a sad, sad turn of events. Claus and Sonny's and the maid's performance are worth it.

419109,5,6302033020,"At the beginning of the film, one of Alan Dershowitz' law students who has volunteered to assist in putting together Claus Von Blow's defense appeal says, ""I agree Von Blow is guilty, but then, that's the fun - that's the challenge."" Within this seemingly innocent and yet irreverent statement is really the essence of how justice is meted out in the United States. It is not a straightforward linear institution in which those who are guilty are punished, and those who are innocent are freed, as most people believe it should be to maintain a healthy society. What most people don't realize is that because the justice system has become so large and complex with literally hundreds of crimes being committed every day and almost as many being tried in court, the entire institution is essentially a legalistic game.

Acquittals or convictions are not necessarily the result of whether someone is truly innocent or guilty. Verdicts are the product of a host of other circumstances: the strength of evidence against a suspect, the adeptness of the prosecution, the backgrounds of the jury, and, most importantly, the quality of a defendant's representation. After having been convicted of twice trying to murder his wife and multi-millionaire Sunny Von Blow, Claus Von Blow hired one of the best legal minds of the late 20th century, Alan Dershowitz, to handle his appeal.

""Reversal of Fortune"" (based on Dershowitz' book of the same name) is a dramatization of the circumstances surrounding the eventual vegetative state of Sunny Von Blow, the indictment against her husband Claus Von Blow, his first trial in which he was convicted, and the stunning appeal in which the Supreme Court of Rhode Island overturned the lower court's conviction thereby awarding the defendant a new trial. Aside from the melodrama between Claus and Sunny and the events leading up to Sunny's coma, a hefty portion of the film is devoted to the case on appeal. Defense lawyer and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, played by the late Ron Silver in one of his best performances, is the captain of a makeshift law-firm comprised of law students who will get their first taste of an actual case.

As interesting as the flashbacks involving Claus, Sunny, their children, and some of Claus' love interests are, the scenes involving Dershowitz and the law students, and how they prepare the appeal are the most fascinating aspects of the film. Their meetings and discussions which involve dissecting the prosecution's case to find weaknesses demonstrate the behind-the-scenes preparations that occur before going into court. At one point, Dershowitz explains to his students that cases are won in the field and not the courtroom. The transcripts of the original trial become the basis by which Dershowitz' team destroys the prosecution's case. For example, the legal team go through minute details, such as syringes whose needles have insulin encrusted on them which were found at the crime scene. The students do research and are told by medical experts that ""dirty needles"" are inconsistent with injection because the skin acts as a ""swab"" and cleans the needle after injection. These are the kinds of minute details which end up having large legal implications that help determine the resulting verdict on appeal.

What keeps the story moving is the outstanding acting. Jeremy Irons (in an Academy-Award-Winning performance) steals the show with his enigmatic performance of what Sunny considers ""not a normal person."" Irons finds that strange combination of cool detachment and spontaneous passion, especially with regards to women. Over and over, Dershowitz tries without success to uncover who is client really is, aside from all the muck splashed in the tabloids. Ron Silver keeps up with Irons stride-for-stride, showing us Alan Dershowitz as the lawyer who is at first fascinated then all-consumed by the case. Glenn Close is completely believable as Sunny Von Blow, the filthy rich heiress who likes pills, sweets, and lying in bed more than anything else. Honorable mention goes to the actors playing the students, some of whom have gone onto fine careers (both in acting and in law!) Apparently, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was one of Dershowitz' law students who worked on the case, although he does not appear to be mentioned by name in the film. A wonderful film overall, and a strange prelude to the OJ Simpson case of a few years later. The film has it all: sex, murder, and legal corruption. How could you go wrong?",1432944000,,4518,5.068548387096774

419111,4,6302033020,"A contemplative, but playful account of a cause clbre.  Millionairess Sunny von Blow's vegetative state persisted from 1980 to 2008 (when she died, aged 76).  The cause of this coma was alleged to be an injection of insulin by her second husband, Claus von Blow, a classicist and former assistant to oil king J. Paul Getty.  Blow was convicted by a jury in 1982 and this film, based on the book by his appellate counsel, Alan Dershowitz,concentrates on the relationship between legal team and client during the appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, seeking to reverse the convictions of attempted murder.  The structure is intriguing, with theories, strategies and machinations presented (satisfyingly) on multiple levels and through numerous shifts of time.  Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close, as the strange,rich, unhappy couple, are superb, as is Ron Silver as Dershowitz.  ""Two packs of Vantage, please.

I have seen these movie over ten times and have read the book and the story of murder in an elite society is still a page turner for me.

419136,3,6302033020,"The words of this review title happened to be written in pen on the videotape box of this movie that I checked out of the library. Whoever wrote them told no lie.

The movie is based on Alan Dershowtiz's book of the same title, where he takes on the appeal of the attempted murder conviction of socialite Klaus von Bulow, who allegedly tried to murder his wife Sunny through an injection of insulin. Dershowitz tells this to his group of college-age legal helpers, one of whom tries to drop out in disgust, but Dershowitz changes her mind by telling her that the idea is to get the money to continue their pro bono legal quest to help two young black ghetto kids who are also facing criminal charges. Dershowitz also mentions that the state of Rhode Island's judiciary has a corrupt legal system. Also, when they do a test of how liquid coats straws, it suggests that the evidence that von Bulow might have injected Sunny with insulin might not be so real after all.

Jeremy Irons gives a good performance as an icy, haughty aristocrat, both in his scenes with Dershowitz and his legal team and with the flashback scenes with him and Sunny. Also, Dershowitz is shown as haughty and pompous in his own right, even if his heart is supposedly in the right place. And the movie does not make any conclusions as to whether von Bulow was guilty or not; no surprise when Dershowitz's tactic was to cast doubt on the evidence that his client actually made any attempt to kill his wife, even if he had a motive to do so. Indeed, the movie implies that Sunny had mental problems and was probably suicidal.

Dershowitz might have wanted to come across as a hero doing his job. The latter is certainly true, but he has proved no more heroic than any other defense lawyer.",1409702400,,1759,4.507836990595611

Irons has done a ton of TV since then but has never had any movie roles even approaching his work in RofF.  In this movie he plays Claus von Bulow with tremendous understatement to the point that he almost fades into the scenery.  He does well in his scenes opposite Glenn Close as mentally deteriorating Sunny von Bulow.

419234,5,6302033020,"The premise is, a demonstration of how defense attorney and law professor Alan Dershowitz created an successful appellate plea against a standing verdict of guilt for Claus Von Bulow.  Imagine the game of CLUE to the exponent of '10'.

In this case, the precedent which the appeals court had established for itself was the standard that a theory of guilt and conviction based on the grounds of deficient evidence could only be overturned by the presentation of a superior theory.  Hence the defense team concocted a wholesale assault on every supposition of evidence on which the prosecution had obtained their conviction.

Professor and students wrestle to maintain their professional composure while probing how to walk a fine line between moral guilt without legal culpability OR legal guilt without moral culpability.  The principle at stake is that our American justice system demands that the guilty as well as the innocent are entitled to a vigorous defense.  Imagine the irony of Adolf Hitler contacting a Jewish defense attorney to represent him at Nuremberg...do you turn him down, or do you take the case and then kill him...the tension in the air gets pretty thick sometimes.  But don't be put off by a couple gratuitous explosions of the f-bomb.  The quirky nature of the family involved is too entertaining to not have thick skin.

The real question in my mind as I've viewed this film several times over, was how much 'intent' had been loaded into the mother's suicide attempt (played by Glen Close, who also narrates).  It's a compelling dilemma of the law team's question of whether or not the step children had framed a guilty man.  It's also a component of what Claus Von Bulow ultimately admits to his attorney, about his love letters to his mistress that got dumped in Sonny's lap one day unexpectedly, practically spitting out the phrase, ""Alexandra the spiteful.""
More than once we hear the anguished question from Glen Close, ""How could you leave me there alone with all those beautiful letters?"" (Not to me!)",1360800000,,2033,4.967551622418879

419265,5,6302033020,"In murder mysteries, there's usually a Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Adrian Monk or even a Shawn Spencer standing by to solve everything.

However, real life isn't so tidy. And nothing was tidy in the widely-publicized incident where socialite Sunny von B&uuml;low lapsed into a coma, with her husband as the only suspect. ""Reversal of Fortune"" quietly chronicles a real-life murder investigation and trial, while avoiding melodrama and theatrics -- or assumptions about what really happened.

On December 21 1980, Sunny von B&uuml;low (Glenn Close) was found unconscious on her bathroom floor, and remained in a vegetative coma until her death almost exactly twenty-eight years later. Her suspicious children Alex and Ala began a private investigation, and soon Sunny's estranged husband Claus (Jeremy Irons) was accused of having tried to kill her twice. He was tried and convicted.

Meanwhile, lawyer Alan Dershowitz is struggling to help a pair of young men on death row when he's unexpectedly contacted by Claus, who wants Dershowitz to take on his case. With a small army of young law students, Alan starts investigating a murder case that may not have been a murder, with a client whom the American people have already decided is guilty. But there are clues and questions that may never be answered.

""Reversal of Fortune"" is a very rare movie about murder investigations and legal cases, because it's remarkably realistic. It answers no questions about what happened to Sunny -- was it murder, suicide or a freak accident? -- and there are no big dramatic courtroom showdowns or dramatic clue-finds like there are on TV.

Instead, ""Reversal of Fortune"" glides through on everything that really HAPPENED, and on the genuine grueling process of puncturing a seemingly airtight case. We follow Dershowitz as he and his team sift through the evidence and testimonies, and while it lacks the thrills of the usual TV mysteries, it's all the more fascinating because there are no easy answers or innocent people.

And lest we get bored there are frequent flashbacks to Sunny and Claus's marriage. Some are told by Claus, some by court testimony, and some by Sunny herself (often seen curled and corpselike in her hospital bed, getting sponge-baths and hooked up to an IV).

Pretty much everybody in this movie does an excellent job. The real standout here is Jeremy Irons, who plays the ""Eurotrash gold-digger"" to charming erudite perfection -- you can never tell if Claus is a cold-blooded sociopath, or a sleek charmer with a sick sense of humor. Glenn Close also does a good job both as the neurotic, rather childish Sunny and the comatose woman looking back on her life.

""Reversal of Fortune"" avoids the tropes of most movies about criminal investigations -- this is a tasteful, intricate look at a real-life court war. Watch it at least twice to absorb its quality.",1276041600,,2875,5.050632911392405
419266,4,6302033020,"There are so many reasons to love Reversal Of Fortune: The film is based on the book by Alan Dershowitz, who defended Klaus Von Bulow in the very early 1980s

Delineated here, Von Bulow is a reptile of a womenizer, accused of trying to kill his wife Sonny--Twice: Christmastimes of 1979 and 1980. Sonny lived for about twenty five years in a coma after 1980.

Von Bulow is old, cold money, and in the 1960s, had stayed for days in an apartment with his mother's corpse. He is icy, coy, and manipulative: he jokes about the alleged crime, and seems to enjoy making you guess his guilt or innocence.

This is a game, one Klaus seems to enjoy narrating in upper crust strokes ""That is what an innocent man would say,"" Dershowitiz says. Klaus smirks. I know.

Dershowitz is a passionate attorney who only took the case because he felt the evidence chain was contaminated when Sonny's children had a private investigator take the case. He is liberal, mercurial, and obsessive about his work.

The contrast between the two--Von Bulow is played by Jeremy Irons and Dershowitz Ron Silver--is what makes the film work. Frankly, I have not seen such a fantastic pairing of contrasts since Sidney Portier and Rod Stieger in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Heat-of-the-Night/dp/B000053VBH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Heat of the Night</a>. Iron's is great, but the normally slick Silver is brilliant at playing the fiery advocate.

It works as whodunit, and as character driven-drama: but the kicker that brings Reversal Of Fortune into the top tier is that it makes complex legal issues part of the story.

This film was made in 1990, when Law and Order was a new and relatively unknown show. People were naive about law then: we did not talk about crime labs, DNA, and arcane points of complex evidence as we do now--mainly due to Law and Order. It was not part of our culture.

Reversal Of Fortune actually makes the defenses investigation a character. It talks about the legal process and evidence in detail, treats you as smart but places the subjects in layman terms. It is not just the drama or the characters or the acting that make the movie work.

The synergy of all of it-especially given the times, is what makes Reversal of Fortune a great film. Watch it now and it could have been made today.",1273708800,,2350,4.9291139240506325

419268,5,6302033020,"Sunny von B&uuml;low died finally a short while ago without ever having emerged from her coma that it was charged was attempted homicide by her husband Clause.  He supposedly did it by injecting her with insulin. Claus knew he needed first rate legal help and ended up with Alan Dershowitz turning things around for him.  Interesting as the law is in this film, the characters of Sunny and Clause are even better.

Sunny von B&uuml;low is a hard woman to like.  Glen Close's depiction doesn't make that task any easier.  Ironically, Sunny in a coma isn't all that different from Sunny in regular life.  Basically, Sunny took up space.  She was neurotic, spoiled, used to getting her own way and never did anything worthwhile.  If she hadn't been rich, no one would have noticed her.  She spent a great deal of time asleep--actually, a huge amount of time asleep.  And when she was awake, she was more like still half asleep. I think she could easily be described as someone who was sleepwalking through her life.

Which doesn't excuse Clause if he did try to kill her but it presents an interesting dichotomy.  For Clause von B&uuml;low is potentially very likable and Jeremy Irons captures that perfectly. He is self deprecating, humorous, a wonderful raconteur.  People love dining out with Clause if for no other reason than they feel better because he is such a wit and so much fun.  Clause is even very witty with Dershowitz, which takes some doing when you are battling attempted murder charges. He can be totally deadpan which makes him even funnier.

I don't know what Clause von B&uuml;low did to his wife.  He may have tried to murder her and then again, he may not.  That isn't enough to make an attempted murder case. So no one will ever know. But of Clause and Sunny as people, there is no doubt in my mind that if you were arranging a night out, it would be Clause, not Sunny, you would want at your table.

419271,5,6302033020,"I have read very little about the von Bulow case, yet this movie seemed so enticing: Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons star as the miserable rich couple of Newport, whose tragically shallow lives take a ""theatrical"" turn when Sunny suffers from 2 comas, a year apart, the second rendering her a permanent vegetable.

These two incredible actors are buttressed by some familiar faces (at least some were familiar in the early 90s): Ron Silver, Annabella Sciorra, Christine Baranski, Felicity Huffman, and Tom Wright.

The ambiguous nature of the film easily draws you in, and the dynamic cram sessions of Prof Dershowitz's squad were interesting to watch.  The film flips between this incredible mystery of attempted murder, and the legal struggles of the case.  This dynamic makes the film balanced, suspenseful, and thoughtful.  No one in this film is terrible or innocent.  Claus is right when he states that no one will ever truly know what happened that night, not even him.  Moments like these make this film.  You begin to wonder, what is true?  Can you remember anything as it truly happened, especially after someone suggests things about that memory?  Intriguing ideas, thought-provoking dialogue, all with intense mystery and even some sly humor, truly this is an exceptional movie.

The best moment of this film is when Prof. Dershowitz says, ""You are a very strange man.""  To which Claus replies, ""You have no idea.""

419275,4,6302033020,"`Reversal of Fortune' is an extremely well constructed look into one of the most controversial `attempted murder' trials of the 80's; that of socialite Claus von Bulow and his rich wife Sunny, who lay in a coma.

The film is told through the narrative of Sunny herself, never force-feeding the audience a manipulated conclusion but laying out the facts and allowing us to draw our own; did he or didn't he?  The film follows Claus' appeal and attempt at a reversal of fortune, hoping that Professor Alan Dershowitz (who penned the non-fiction book for which the film is based) can exonerate him of the criminal charges he is facing.  Looking at things from Dershowitz perspective, as well as Sunny's and even Claus' allow the audience to get a complete and full picture, even if the loose ends are never fully tied up.

I have never been drawn to legal thrillers of this kind, but all the praise that went to Iron's Oscar winning performance drew me to see this movie.  As far as films of this genre go, this is probably one of the finest.  It thoroughly held my attention throughout, for the script was tightly woven and the mystery within the case is always manifest full force.

The performances also help to move the film along at a pace that holds onto the interest of the audience.  Ron Silver is superb as the distressed and concerned Professor trying to do his job without compromising his conscience.  Annabella Sciorra is also fantastic in a very small role as Sarah.

The real stars of the show though are Irons and Close.  Glenn Close lingers in every scene as her narrative captivates the story and propels each scene forward.  In fact I think that her narrative is the strongest aspect of the script.  Jeremy Iron's though, has the juiciest role as the accused.  His cold and matter-of-fact delivery is so bone chilling that he becomes unforgettable.  This is a truly understated and subtle performance that is easy to pass over if you're not looking in the right places (that would be his eyes) for all the acting gymnastics his character is performing.  Now, I'm not sure that he was deserving of Oscar (I actually thought that fellow nominees Robert De Niro and Kevin Costner were more deserving of the gold) but I must say that his performance should not go without praise, for he fearlessly allowed his characters flaws to overtake him.

In the end though, it is the script and pristine direction (Barbet Schroeder received a much deserved directing Oscar nomination) that elevate the film from a generic genre film into a near perfect thriller that will entertain even the most skeptical of critics.  Like I said, I am not a fan of the genre in general, but this film is truly brilliant and proves to be at the top of its game on all fronts.",1219968000,,2761,4.657731958762887
419276,4,6302033020,"The film opens on the cottages of the wealthy at Newport on the Rhode Island shore. Then there is a hospital with a guard at the door. A woman lies in a coma. Medical attention saved her life. Her children distrusted her husband Claus. A second coma becomes permanent. Her two children hired a lawyer and a private investigator; they found a needle used to inject insulin! Would her husband benefit greatly from her death? Who else? Claus Von Bulow was convicted of attempted murder. This film tells how this verdict was overturned on appeal. [Was Claus convicted because he was guilty of adultery? Isn't that part of the lifestyles of the rich and famous?]

Professor Alan Dershowitz is called by Claus to handle his appeal. Can he trust his client to tell the truth? [The ""Perry Mason"" novels give an answer.] The maid Maria tells of suspicious activities. The film shows how Dershowitz assembled a legal team to work the appeal. One problem is the overwhelming belief of the American public in Claus' guilt. Did he get a fair trial? What happens if private individuals collect the evidence and choose what to turn over to the authorities? [Private prosecutions.] What if a family member was buying illegal drugs? Why would a lawyer withhold his notes if there was nothing exculpatory? Did Sunny dabble in drugs? Did she have a problem with alcohol and other drugs? Does money buy happiness? The RI Supreme Court will reverse a conviction on technical grounds if they believe the defendant was innocent. [Does the life of the super-rich seem dreary and pointless?] Why does Claus seem to be cold and uncaring?

There is a problem with the encrusted needle. Could it have been planted? Flashbacks tell of Sunny's actions. She used drugs and hid them. The film shows the interactions of the defense team. If there is a weal link in the chain of circumstantial evidence then it is all discarded. [Is this the only trial with planted evidence?] Will a witness turn into a double agent? If the laboratory made a mistake with the evidence can the verdict be correct? [Garbage in, garbage out.] Professor Alan Dershowitz shows his skill at the RI Supreme Court. The last scenes provide alternate explanations as to what happened to Sunny. Which is true? The second trial came to a different conclusion, based on the new evidence.

This is an intellectual and educational film based on a true case. If it is dramatized, it is still an interesting story for those who know little of the event. People who made a decision as to guilt or innocence at the time of this case may be projecting their outlook on life and society.

""What do you call the fear of dying from an overdose of insulin --- claus - trophobia.""  His delivery is refined, slow, and absolutely flat, no affect.  The look of bemused horror on the faces of the students summarizes all the contradictions of this movie - they simply do not understand the man they're defending.

Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for this role - he deserved two.  His narration and acting in Brideshead Revisited almost made casting him as Claus von Bulow an inevitability, he seems born to this role.  That he appears so natural on screen is extraordinary because von Bulow is such an odd, complex, and thoroughly detached man.  His veneer is like a lobster's shell, an exoskeleton; he smokes a cigarette with the same precision and care a surgeon would reserve for slicing brain tissue.  It's clear that even a trial will not reveal what makes this man tick, and in the end it doesn't matter, he's just so much fun to watch.

Having the film narrated by Sunny was genius, and Glen Close too seems to have inherited this part rather than auditioned for it.  Her looks and delivery are right on point; one wonders how different life in a coma is from life inside a depression fueled by booze and pills.  Alan Dershowitz, played admirably by Ron Silver, provides the junkyard dog energy that fuels the picture - everything about him is in stark contrast to the refined mansions of Rhode Island where even attempted murder must be civilized, polite, and done according to form.

Flawless production values put viewers inside the rarified atmosphere, not just wealth, but wealth that has had time to age and grow soft with decadence.

However, the psychologist who worked with the Dershowitz team (T.S.) is a family friend and I have heard him talk about the case several times. Many people close to the investigation believe Von Buelow was framed for a crime a he probaly did commit. Thus, because of the tampering with evidence by a special prosecuter hired by the state, Von Buelow was likely over-charged, or undercharged, and was found not guilty because of the tampering. For example; if two guys get into a fight in a bar, and one gets hurt a little more than the other, should the lucky one be charged with Battery, Assault, or Attempted Murder? In this state, Battery is 0 - 1 year, Assault is 2-10 years, and Attempted Murder is 20-life. Quite a difference. From that perspective, who could not receive a fair trial no matter what. When the defense learned that the needle apparently used to deliver the insulin was encrusted with evaporated water this was seen as a huge flaw in the governments case as the victims skin would have removed the water when the needle was withdrawn. That is, the skin would tighten around the needle, and wipe the needle point clean. As portrayed by Jeremy Irons (Best Actor) in his role as Von Buelow, the most striking evidence against Von Buelow, was Von Buelow himself. Many of Dershowitz's students expressed personal outrage Dershowitz would even consider championing the appeal. Von Buelow made up funny jokes about his wife's condition making it harder and harder to represent him. But this film sure does have class. Jeremy Irons, as Von Buelow, delivers a performance so good, that it's worth the price of admission just to see the master actor at work.

With its astonishingly complex narrative structure, its pitch-black humor, its superb performances and its detailings of utter misery and despair among the lives of America's wealthiest people, the film is reminiscent in some ways of CITIZEN KANE, and when the film is at its very best (particularly when Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons are onscreen as Sunny and Claus von Bulow), the comparisons to the latter sequences in the Welles film when Charlie Kane and Susan Alexander square off in misery in Kane's Florida mansion seem most apt. Irons won an Oscar for his exceptionally funny performance as the perverse Claus, but Close may deserve the true acting honors for making Sunny's gilded hell seem so real. There are also superb supporting performances, particularly from Uta Hagen as Sunny's devoted maid and Christine Baranski as Claus's sinister girlfriend. Only the frame plot involving Ron Silver as Claus's appeals attorney Alan Dershowitz seems weak--in part because since Dershowitz's own son was a producer, and Dershowitz himself had input into the script, his character seems unrealistically sanctified. (His character is treated basically as a paragon of both humanitarianism and liberalism.) But the weak stuff with Dershowtiz and his legal hotshots is easily put aside when you get to such moments of camp genius as Close's Sunny (in a cashmere twinset and sunglasses, while holding a cigarette) eating an enormous hot fudge sundae at the dinner table while her children look on in mute horror.",1117411200,10,1802,5.304195804195804

419291,4,6302033020,"Striking, if sometimes creepy, performances by Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons highlight this unevenly directed take on the Claus Von Bulow story of the degenerate rich adapted from the book by Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz.  Dershowitz, who loves being in the limelight almost as much as he loves the law, took on the task of saving Claus Von Bulow from prison for the attempted murder of his rich wife initially as a means of raising money to help him in his pro bono cases.  The rather heavy-handed manner in which we are advised of this should not detract from Dershowitz's work.  The irony is that as the case developed Dershowitz became persuaded that Claus was innocent.
Whether Dershowitz convinced himself of Von Bulow's innocence to assuage a possibly guilty conscience is a good question.  Remember Dershowitz is the guy who said after the O.J. Simpson trial (he was one of Simpson's lawyers) that he didn't know whether Simpson was guilty or not.  While that may be a good stance for a defense attorney, it is an insincere one for the public figure that Dershowitz has become.
Starring as Dershowitz is Ron Silver in an uneven performance that at times made me think of Gabe Kaplan doing a young and uncomedic Groucho Marx.  I wonder if Dershowitz was entirely flattered.
Director Barbet Schroeder (Barfly 1987; Single White Female 1992) uses several points of view to tell the story, including a voice-over from Glenn Close's Sunny Von Bulow as she lies comatose, but also from recollections by Jeremy Irons' Claus Von Bulow.  We see some scenes twice, colored by the differing points of view.  This technique is entirely appropriate since what really happened is far from clear to this day.  It is Claus Von Bulow's fortune that was reversed.  Whether the first two juries or the third were right is something Schroeder leaves for the audience to determine.
But make no mistake about it: the heart of the movie is Jeremy Irons' Oscar-winning performance.  His subtle artistry based on a deep conception (true to life or not) of the aristocratic and Germanic Claus allowed him to create a persona that is cold and aloft, yet somehow sympathetic.  The contrast with Silver's Brooklyn-born hyper-energetic Dershowitz made for some good cinematic chemistry, although sometimes it came across like nice Jewish boy defends a vampire.
Glenn Close's flawless rendition of the idle, drug-befouled Sunny reminds us once again that she is a great actress.  Unfortunately I don't think Schroeder spent as much time and energy as he should have with the people who played Dershowitz's law students.  They seemed amateurish and unconvincing in just about every scene.  And there were too many of them--law students, that is.  Some distillation of intent, and more directorial guidance might have helped.
Nicholas Kazan's script has a number of good lines in it, not the least of which is this: Dershowitz: ""You are a very strange man."" Claus Von Bulow: ""You have no idea.""  Also nice was Von Bulow's observation after they are seated in the restaurant and after the waiter has called him ""Doctor"" Von Bulow: ""When I was married to Sunny, we never got this table.  Now, two injections of insulin and I'm a doctor.""  Indeed it is partly Kazan's snappy, comedic and self-revelatory lines that humanize Claus Von Bulow's character and persuade us that he could very well be innocent.
While I like Dershowitz's self-serving style and his confidence, what I admire most about the man is his realistic conception of the defense attorney's role in our society and his idea of what makes a good lawyer; that is, a good lawyer is one who recognizes not only that every person deserves the best defense their resources allow, but that he himself deserves to defend those with the best resources.",1058918400,5,3796,4.940251572327044
419306,4,6302033020,"I liked this movie, my favorite character was Jeremy Irons as Claus Von Bulow.  Its amazing that he could talk like that through the whole movie (German Accent).  In case you don't know, this movie is about a real life story about an aristocrat that was convicted of murdering his wife.  The movie is about the appeals process for that conviction and how Alan Dershowitz assigns parts of the case to teams of students who work to get get Von Bulow a successful appeal.  The movie is not boring nor is it predictable (the two main criteria I use to critique a movie) so all in all i liked it.  The only problem i had with it is the generous portrayal of Alan Dershowit he comes off as a highly moral and liberal person, but personally i've never liked him or his opinions on certain issues.  By the way, someone said that the character did not look like Dershowitz, but i've got a picture of Dershowitz that pretty much looks like the character in the movie...",1057881600,2,959,4.420454545454546
419307,5,6302033020,"I confess ignorance about the supposedly real world trial of Claus von Bulow (charged with the attempted murder of his socialite wife) that this movie is based on. May be it was just not that big of a deal outside the US. But the movie is a riveting thriller and a fascinating treat if you have a thing for courtroom drama.
Faced with a client who he obviously believes is probably guilty, Alan Dershowitz (Bulow's clearly sly lawyer) resorts to one of the least respected of all legal tactics: blaming the victim. The film then escalates from a rather ordinary legal drama into an endless string of ad hominem against the character of Sunny von Bulow (played notoriously well by Close) who, being in a coma, is hardly in any shape to defend herself.
The film seems to have a pretty hardline posture, frequently suggesting that if Sunny von Bulow didn't cause her own misfortune, she certainly had it coming to her. Anything offered in defense of Sunny (testimony from friends/relatives) is swiftly discredited in one way or another. Is this an audacious bias in the script? Most certainly. So be prepared for it. But the jury does not seem to wilt. As though this is not enough to make you cringe, the comatose vegetable of a Sunny (in her coma bed) has words put into her mouth by the unscrupulous lawyer, a shady voice recording that is. How the lawyer could get away with this in a court of law is beyond me.
If I replace Bulow with OJ, and I doubt the story would change too much at least in the manner that this movie intends to potray it, I would actually find it a little taut, even villainous in its depiction of liberties with legal integrity.
But this is not a documentary, it is a Hollywood flick. Jeremy Irons in a quirky award winning performance is superb as usual. Glenn Close even from the stupor of her medical condition is fascinating. Dershowitz, the scum of the legal profession is, well, just that. In other words, great acting all round.
The climax is never found or attempted, it's left to your creativity. Was Bulow exonerated? May be. I read his criminal conviction was overturned. But in public opinion, after seeing this movie, I'd say not. Contours of the OJ trial.
As for the movie, a pretty decent, well paced fare and definitely a good evening's rental recommendation.",1053043200,,2300,4.625916870415648
419308,4,6302033020,"Could you enjoy a movie in which there was no ""good guy"" or similar person to root for?  Have you ever wondered why Claus von Bulow was eventually cleared of charges after the sensational trial he had in the 1980's.  Do you want to know who won the Best Actor Oscar for 1990?  Well, if you can say yes to any of these questions, you should see ""Reversal of Fortune"".  If you say no to all of the above you might want to check something else out instead.
You may disagree with my assessment that there is no one to root for in this movie.  However, consider the characters to choose from; a wealthy socialite who glides through life without any apparent concern for anyone but himself, a wealthy socialite who naps through life without any concern for anyone but herself, a brilliant law professor who believes that the Law is a tool to be manipulated by a skilled craftsman, the law professor's willing accomplices (i.e. students) who enjoy the challenge of finding loopholes to free the legally tried and convicted socialite.  There aren't many other to choose from.  There are the children we occasionally see but they don't seem to care so why should we.  Maybe you might agree with the law professor, Alan Dershowitz (played excellently by Ron Silver) in his legal observations.  This is, after all, the man who helped get O J Simpson off a double murder charge.  The movie is about his efforts to overturn the attempted murder conviction of our hero(?!?) Claus von Bulow.  Lawyer Dershowitz is first met in the midst of a furious attempt to save two brothers from the gas chamber.  The brothers are black and have been convicted in the South.  Obviously they are innocent as Dershowitz repeated reminds us.  However, we come to see that ""innocent"" is a relative term to Alan Dershowitz.  Thus even these two brothers are hard to cheer for.
There is a sort of tense excitement as the efforts of the professor and his students unfolds.  However, what is at stake?  The freedom of a man who very well may have been properly convicted.  Is justice to be served in overturning a conviction if there is no real sense that the original conviction was wrong?  In a moment of real potential excitement, we find Dershowitz faced with a real dilemma when a potential witness attempts to frame him (this guy is a real sleaze as well so no point in cheering for him).  However, this potential excitement fizzles like a dud firecracker as we hear a TV news ""sound bite"" exonerating Dershowitz.
Sorry for all the negativity but I came away with the sense that this movie was made on the assumption that it's neat the way dedicated lawyers can help people.  In fact, this movie is testimony that we need legal reforms in this country so that we can regain some respect for the legal processes that we have.  This lack of respect that I have observed falls largely on the likes of people like Dershowitz who have shown that it is money, not race, that accounts for the disparity of judicial consistency in this country.  In this case, there should be no doubt that the wealthy von Bulow paid a pretty penny the first time around only to be convicted.  Why not fork over more money and try it again?  Forgive me for not joining Dershowitz's already corrupted students as one of his cheerleaders.  I give the movie a 4 star rating because the acting is superb (although I think that Jeremy Irons got his Oscar in a weak year).  I also rated it that high because, unfortunately, I think this movie is going to be one I remember for quite a while.",1051401600,2,3531,4.563492063492063
419309,5,6302033020,"This film is far more than just the salacious filmed version of the tabloid scandal documenting Claus von Bulow's conviction and appeal on charges of twice attempting to murder his fabulously wealthy wife Sunny by injecting her with insulin.
Von Bulow was wholly unsympathetic character, idle so-called `Eurotrash,' widely assumed to be slam-dunk guilty, even by the legal team representing him on appeal.  The team's audacious strategy to directly attack the public presumption of guilt-to actually convince the appellate court that this evil man was innocent all along-bears a captivating symmetry to the way Jeremy Irons (playing von Bulow) takes the completely unlikable character and endows him with an almost charming ambiguity.  He makes the same transformation take place within the viewer that took place among his attorneys.  You begin the filming completely convinced von Bulow is evil incarnate, yet Irons somehow gets under your skin and makes you wonder....just maybe....could he be innocent....no, certainly not.....but maybe?
This transformation can be credited not only to Iron's Oscar-winning performance, but to Barbet Schroeder's magnificent and sensitive direction and the many other outstanding performances in the film.  I loved the way the Schroeder visually contrasted the shadowy, languid, dark settings in the von Bulows' Newport mansion to the aggressive, skittish, vigorous young lawyers finding legal inspiration over games of pickup basketball played with cutthroat intensity.
Glenn Close, playing Sunny von Bulow, manages not to be overshadowed by Iron's performance even though her character spends most of the film in a coma.  (Imagine, stunning acting without even moving your pinkie!)
In sum, even though we know the outcome from the start, the movie is a top-flight suspense movie, the best made in years.  Somehow I imagine that Alfred Hitchcock himself would have been proud to call it his.",1047945600,39,1929,5.522033898305085

To this day, the heiress to a small fortune remains a prisoner of her own body, suspended in a coma that some say, Claus had his hand in.  Perhaps we will never know the truth.  The film plays no favorites, allowing for both Claus's innocence and guilt to come forward and be judged. Jeremy Iron's won his Best Actor Oscar, and rightly so, for his absolutely chilling performance.  To be sure the Von Bulow's marriage was far from ideal but perhaps it wasn't as diabolically doomed as some would like to believe.
Warner Home Video has given us the film in a rather worn out looking print. Chips, scratches and dirt inherent in the original camera negative are present throughout and colors are somewhat dated.

The audio has been nicely restored and mixed to 5.1.  There's also an informative commentary track to help you along with the details pertaining to Claus's case.  All in all, this is a film screaming for one of Warner's fabulous 2-disc special editions and, in light of Warner's recent committment to its catalogue library of films, the prospects that this film will eventually be given its due are, I would say, quite good.

419312,4,6302033020,"Barbet Schroeder's ""Reversal of Fortune"" works mostly because the director keeps us away from Jeremy Irons' character and his thoughts, and to adopt his point of view would surely be a mistake. The structure is intensely loose, and perhaps owes much to the celebrated ""Citizen Kane"". The film allows an unconscious Glenn Close to narrate some of the past events, but her calm and sweet voice may lead the viewer to believe she finally found her place, like the William Holden character in ""Sunset Blvd."". Barbet Schroeder uses subjective flashbacks (which makes them not necessarily true), and we always adopt the lawyers point of view: the book that was the source of this film was written by the real von Bulow's lawyer. The relationship established between the aristocrat and the lawyer is very subtle: van Bulow's life depends on the lawyer's ability to succeed, and when the lawyer becomes sure of that, he attempts to eliminate class barriers, allowing himself to call the aristocrat for his first name and inviting him to his home. And yet, van Bulow is so intensely attached to his own way of life that he never loses his facade or temperament, as when he says: ""I don't carry my heart on my sleeves"".
""Reversal of Fortune"" never attempts to find a climax: its quality resides mostly on the ability of the viewer and in the mannerisms of the characters. The film is constructed like a puzzle and its rhythm is pedantic but strangely fascinating. If the filmmakers were trying to create an exercise in style, they surely succeed it: we are left cold and doubtful and the movie lacks a purpose except entertainment.",996364800,3,1621,4.83453237410072

It's all as a result of Jeremy Iron's marvellous portrayal of the enigmatic von Bulow, although all the cast, namely Glenn Close as Sunny von Bulow and Ron Silver as the iconoclastic lawyer Alan Dershowitz, are excellent.  Apparently Woody Allen was slated to play Dershowitz, but was unavailable.
Irons is witty, conservative, and flamboyant.  Apparently he wore the same cut of shirt as von Bulow, whose tails met and were attached together between his legs, to smooth out the shirt near the waistline.  He said this gave him the upright stance and demeanour and helped him enter into von Bulow's character.
