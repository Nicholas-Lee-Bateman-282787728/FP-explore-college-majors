7071038,5,B00USOLZQG,"Fun enough if you don't think too hard. You cant expect a movie with a title like that to take itself seriously. And indeed, it doesnt. There is plenty of unexpected twists that keep the story flowing. There are quite a few good laughs. Altogether, an entertaining film that holds your attention. It is really worth watching.",1427587200,4,325,4.719298245614035

7071042,4,B00USOLZQG,"I think that this movie is not for everyone. I'm hard put to say why I like it - but I do. While I will admit that this isn't exactly Academy Award material, I don't understand the disdain and dislike that some people have shown for it.",1440460800,,236,4.042553191489362

7071044,5,B00USOLZQG,"This guilty pleasure movie is not for everyone. Kind of silly, but in places very funny. There is really stuff to enjoy in this film. I haven't seen the 1993 version that some are referring to, I wonder where I can get it.",1439078400,,222,4.186046511627907

7071050,5,B00USOLZQG,"Clever, stupid, and funny all at the same time. It is amazing some of the dumb things that make one laugh. The aliens are comic book dopes and the situations unreal but both make for a relaxing and fun time.",1434844800,,207,4.2

8708200,5,B00USOLZQG,"I love this movie because it reminds me of those cheesy & fun 1970's Italian sex comedies...that actually have no sex. It's silly, fun, it doesn't take itself seriously and it is a true blue B classic! I also liked the original but I think that one was for a 93 audience and the new one is a cult classic for the audience of today. Not for everyone but if you liked Felini's B reel then you'll love this film.",1469923200,,409,4.125
8708201,3,B00USOLZQG,"A chessy sci-fi flick.  I found it entertaining at times, but I wouldn't watch it again.",1460505600,,88,4.5
