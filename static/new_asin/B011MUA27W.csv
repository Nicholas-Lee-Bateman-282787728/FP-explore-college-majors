7337490,5,B011MUA27W,Finally! The whole season! I can delete all those episodes from my DVR! This incarnation is brilliant in my opinion because it appeals to the kids while I'm howling with laughter at the intelligent humor aimed at the adults and the inside humor of 30 years of the prior turtle incarnations.,1480032000,,290,4.705882352941177

7337496,5,B011MUA27W,"This series will not disappoint most TMNT fans. As a childhood, die-hard TMNT fan, I was a little late watching, but the new movies gave me desire to catch up on more Turtle shows.  This series definitely surpassed all I expected.  Leonardo is still the skilled ninja, fearless leader,  Raphael is still the bada** with the attitude, Donatello still the genius and Michelangelo is still the crazy, fun loving turtle you expect.  The 3D animation style is very impressive and is followed up with an impressive story that carries over from one episode to the next.  The fight scenes and the way they twirl/handle their weapons is awesome.  Definitely makes them seem like ninja's.  I also very much enjoyed the voice actors behind the characters.  Sean Astin is a great Raphael and Jason Biggs is surprisingly a great Leonardo.  Sadly Biggs is removed towards the end of the second season, with Seth Green picking up Leo in season 3.  That was a bit of a change to get adjusted to, but it doesn't ruin the quality of the show.  I have recommended this show to some of my closest friends and I  put it on par with the Star Wars Clone Wars series.  When I was a kid I LOVED the original series, but it feels a tad out dated now days and it's hard for me to get back into it.  So this new series absolutely fills in the void the old series left in my life.... Could go on and on about the new show, but I'm sure there are plenty of reviews explaining more of the story, etc.  I will just say, if you are a TMNT, this is definitely worth a watch.",1467763200,6,1540,4.335664335664336

I have a 4 and 5 year old and wanted to get them into the turtles.  I had never seen this iteration of TMNT and was pleasantly surprised how great it is.  We have watched both seasons and want more! My boys now even want to be turtles for Halloween.

2 or 3 episodes are a bit scary but nothing my boys couldn't handle. Great series and a must buy!",1501804800,3,460,3.967391304347826
