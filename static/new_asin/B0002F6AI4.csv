8027410,5,B0002F6AI4,"This Urusei Yatsura gives you a little more history to the UY universe. Lum is put under a curse at birth. Yeah I know it sounds like the sleeping beauty story, but this is nothing like that curse this curse is far worse. Lum's future happiness is at stake, here, It has some very funny moments as well as some bad moments.",1129680000,,323,4.225806451612903
8027411,4,B0002F6AI4,"This movie is probably the easiest for non-Japanese to understand of all of the Urusei Yatsura series, and has an awesome opening theme.  It's not the deepest (that would be #2), or wierdest (#4), or most exciting (#5), or funniest (#1) of the series; but overall it's the most ""typical"".  If you had to see one movie of Urusei Yatsura to see what it was all about, this is the one to see.  It's 93 minutes of good mindless fun.

This is the last movie that used the character designs from the TV series.

And the opening and closing themes are *awesome*.",1112140800,4,555,4.401960784313726
