1596796,5,B00005JPTK,"In 2009, a dangerous virus spread through New York City and, possibly, the entire world. Now the entire human race has either died or turned into creatures who are impervious to light. Except for one survivor, scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith). For three years, he's been trying to find a way to reverse the effects and hopefully bring humanity back to normal. During his latest roundabout, he was trapped in his car and was about to be attacked when a surviving family (Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan) rescues him from certain doom. Unfortunately, the bloodsuckers have followed. Now Neville must make a last stand, because he would rather die trying than become one of them.

While I wouldn't call I Am Legend a classic in filmmaking, it sure had me riveted. Based on a classic novel by Richard Matheson, and directed by Constantine helmer Francis Lawrence, Legend is a doomsday movie mixed with frightening chills, a reliable performance from Will Smith, and hardly any exposition (made better by the fact that dialogue is minimal).

Legend is hardly considered a blockbuster actioner by any means. While it has Smith, guns, and special effects, this isn't ""Men in Black"" meets 30 Days of Night. More or less, it's a combination of ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man"" (which the source material was previously adapted), and it focuses on top-notch horror sets (much like ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" and ""30 Days of Night"", the shocks come quick rather than being cheap), a sense of claustrophobia, and biting commentary about racial relations that figures into the story (at least I think it does).

And concerning the vampires, Lawrence also outdid himself as well. Since this is a big-budget film, unlike ""30 Days of Night"", the blood-sucking creatures are rendered in full CGI, and have little to do but scream and snarl. And that's fine with me, because it benefactors into the need to just be a good-ol-fashioned fright fest.

Even better is the fact that it doesn't have any major stars backing it up. This is Will Smith's movie through-and-through, and Lawrence made a wise decision not to have him channel the Fresh Prince in a action/horror movie. As I said, the film focuses less on flat-out explaining the story, and more time to flesh out Smith's character, allowing the drama to breathe, while still throwing in action and horror sets all the way through.

As I stress, for those seeking a popcorn-munching action fest, you may be partially right. But the film has more on its mind than just cheap thrills. This is probably why the film won't be memorable, but to be PG-13 and dead-on thrilling (compared to the idiotic thrillers recently dumped into theaters), consider Lawrence not one of the hacks in the business.",1197590400,5,2741,4.898706896551724
1596797,3,B00005JPTK,"I know this will come as a disappointment to the millions of night dwellers willing to risk crowded roads and over priced tickets in order to see this movie, but sadly I Am Legend does not live up to its hype. The third movie release of Richard Matheson's horror classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765357151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>, this film stars Will Smith as a former military officer living in New York City in the year 2012, three years after a deadly virus created to cure cancer mutated and decimated the worlds population, killing 90% of all human beings and transforming almost everyone else into blood thirsty zombie/vampire like creatures called ""night dwellers"" who come out only at night because UV rays from the sun burn their skin.

Will Smith is the last man on earth, his only companion being his family dog named Samantha, or Sam for short, and manikins at the movie rental store that he likes to talk to. He goes though the ""Cast Away"" effect, like Tom Hank's character tries to remain sane by talking to a volleyball, Will Smith talks to manikins. the most stunning aspect of this film is the city itself; a deserted Time Square, overgrown with weeds and taken over by deer and escaped lions, is pretty creepy but unfortunately for this film 28 Days Later outdid it years ago with its deserted London, shot on location without using special effects. Anybody familiar with zombie movies have seen dozens of deserted cities as good or better before, whether it is from the 28 series or Romero's Living Dead series. I Am Legend, although impressive, is hardly groundbreaking in this area.

while the city effects are good, the main focus of this movie is how Will Smith deals with being the last man left alive. a military man at heart, he goes though a rigid routine every day, exercising with his dog in the morning, working in his lab trying to find a cure, making his radio broadcast at noon and hoping someone will answerer, and then spending the rest of the day hunting and gathering supplies. At night, when the night dwellers roam the streets, he returns home where his home transforms into a fortress, and falls asleep in the bathtub. Then, next day, he does the same thing. his tests for a cure drive him to seek out human specimens every now and then, so like in Romero's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-the-Dead-Divimax-Special-Edition/dp/B00008G8L9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;he captures zombies, brings them into his basement, and tries to cure them, more often killing them then helping.

Unfortunately the movie never has a real sense of focus. does it want to be a character drama that keeps the zombies in the background and highlights the characters loneliness and despair like Night of the Living Dead, or does it want to be a classic shoot em up zombie movie like Resident Evil or 28 Weeks Later? It never makes up its mind, and in the end does both poorly. there isn't enough character depth to make this a great character drama, for that it needed to be at least twenty if not thirty minutes longer, and it doesn't have anywhere near enough action to make it a shoot out film; actually there is very little in the way of action. Social commentary is none existent as well, giving this film absolutely nothing to set it apart from other zombie/horror/virus movies from this year, or any other year. its lack of originality and depth makes almost guarantees this movie to go the way of other I Am Legend movie adoptions&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B000WC3A0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Man/dp/B000P0J0BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Man</a>. It will make its million dollars, and end up in discount bins five years from now. It's a shame really; this movie had the potential to be something truly great.

Re-watch value; low.",1197590400,,4149,5.4080370942812985
1596798,5,B00005JPTK,"I will keep this simple. Excellent movie, not for everyone, do not go in expecting monsters and gory scares, do not bring little children, be ready to cry, jump and smile. Will Smith is excellent, the man cannot make a bad movie.",1197590400,4,229,4.476190476190476
1596799,3,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith stars on the fourth adaptation of Matheson's book I Am Legend. The movie, which is set in 2009-2012, fails to entertain most of the time.

After a doctor discovers the cure for cancer (2009), evertyhing seems to be right until some of the patients star dying out of this cure. The results?  99% of the population of Earth infected with only 1% of the whole world immune, if anything.

Three years after the infection has taken place (2012), Robert Neville (Will Smith), is one of the only, if  not the only, survivor from this deadly virus, who is trying to find a cure for the ""cure"". Called the KV, this virus, does not kill the human, but it turns them in to what the movie describes as ""dark seekers"".

The movie fails on evolving past anything. Not only does the movie take a while to develop, but the development if not clear enough. The movie becomes slow, and not much goes on (and how can it when the characters are: Smith, Sam:The Dog, and Mannequins). Once the ""dark seekers"" are introduced, the movie does pick its pace up a little bit, but this is not until after 50 minutes through the movie.

The movie is unclear on how humans change from human-like, to not human at all. The script is dull, acting is so-so, and effects might make you jump out of the your seat once in a while. What we have here is a sci-fi/horror flick that is neither sci-fi or horror, its more like a slow-drama with mutants.

Please try and avoid this movie, just if possible. Just remember ""God didn't make this, we did"" and that's whats Neville believes.",1197590400,4,1555,4.454225352112676
1596800,4,B00005JPTK,"As this first volume of Captain Herlock opens, the last of the crew of his ship, the Arcadia has been captured. The authorities believe that the era of space piracy has finally ended. But they've forgotten one thing. Captain Herlock is still numbered among the missing. He's only come out of hiding because he was summoned by a scientist who has vital information about a great threat to the whole universe, the demon Noo. Arriving too late to save the professor, he is able to keep his son, Tadashi, from being taken by Noo's undead minions. Herlock must gather his crew from an unpenetrable prison in order to have any chance of fighting this great evil!

The production on this title is top-rate, giving it a film-like quality. The designs try to emulate a 70s anime but the look always seems natural, not forced. All of the main characters radiate enigmas and chew up the scenery with intensity lacking in most live actors these days.",1113523200,9,938,4.684848484848485
1596801,5,B00005JPTK,"Last year in Japan a monumental event took place. Over the course of one year the thirteen part series Space Pirate Captain Herlock: Endless Oddessy/Outside Legend was released on DVD. The DVD's were released once a month on the 21st of every month in 2002-2003. Now the series has come to America. And it has been well worth the wait.
The Space Pirates have been rounded up. All except for one. The legendary Captain Herlock (prononced ""Harlock""). He is currently in exile on the Planet Of Rubble. When his friend Professor Daiba is killed by the entitys known only as the ""Nu"", Herlock once again sets sail on the Sea Of Stars to get to the bottom of these mysterious beings appearance.
Directed by Taro Rin, this DVD collection surpasses Harlock Saga released two years ago by Central Park Media. The first volume contains the series initial four episodes. The animation is superb. It still retains the classic Matsumoto look while being very modern. The CGI animation has been refined dramactically and now looks better integrated into the classic 2D animation. No more of the plastic looking ships like in Harlock Saga. The one complaint I have is that sometimes the transfer looks a tad on the grainy side, but that has only been in a few places. The sound on this DVD is also excellent. Both language tracks are presented in 5.1 Stereo Surround Sound. The default language setting is English with translated Signs. This sounds like it would be obtrusive but Pioneer/Geneon has made sure that the subtitled signs would not be placed so as to be a hinderance. The quality of the English voice acting is also top notch. Herlock has always been a very powerful character and his English voice conveys that very well. When he speaks, you listen.
The Extras on this disc are a little sparse. There's a character gallery, Japanese Intro, trailers, and that's about it. Hopefully future volumes will include more.
There are not enough words to describe what a fantastic series this is. For Matsumoto fans this is a must have. For anime fans this DVD will make an excellent addition to your library that you can proudly display.
Yes indeed. He has returned........",1082851200,23,2162,4.798927613941019
1596802,4,B00005JPTK,"This DVD is a must have for anyone who knows about the TV series in the 80s (in my case, the French version called ""Albator"").
PROs: The quality of the animation is great and bring up tonnes of good memories. The characters are very well done. Great music!
Matsumoto had many years to rework and redefine what he wants to say with these characters and settings.
CONs: To much emphasis on the ""look"" of the main character (Captain Herlock). Might be slow at times for people who wants lots of action.

1596803,5,B00005JPTK,"Over the years the one anime series which has left a long impression was the ""Space Pirate Captain Harlock"" sequences from the ""Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years"" series that aired on TV. Until then, only the Galaxy Express movies and Arcadia of My Youth have lived up to my initial expectations of what Harlock is about: sacrifice, heroism, and the coming of age.
I first saw this DVD at a friend's house and was more than pleasantly surprised as it really does seem to capture what I loved about the initial series. The artwork, sound, and dialogue are terrific. The story is reminiscent of the first series, though this is not a remake.
What can I say? Five stars.",1078012800,13,683,4.560975609756097
1596804,4,B00005JPTK,"I didn't know what to expect with this DVD since there wasn't any information available when I ordered it. It was better than I expected in its quality, but was a disappointment with its content. I was expecting 70's style animation (I have seen ""Albator"" on TV as a child), but was pleased to discover that it is contemporary (and quite spectacular). I also liked the music. The story is quite good, but you will be left wanting at the end; apparently the story will be continued in part 2: ""The Tendrils of Fear"". I'm not sure if I would have spent so much money on a DVD if I knew that I needed to get at least one more to get the complete story. This is a disk that should be part of a set, not sold on its own. So, if suspense bothers you, then my best advice would be to wait until part 2 becomes available and buy them both together. Or if you're really patient, wait to see if they get put together in a boxed set and save yourself some money!",1077667200,3,951,4.118279569892473

Haven't heard from him in a while, but hoping he will do another scifi soon. This movie was good, although with any zombie 'type' movie, it is usually slow until they appear. Well, with the exception of World War Z with Brad Pitt. I still think it takes one hell of a good actor to carry an entire movie by one's self. So kudos to Smith.

1597326,5,B00005JPTK,"Purchased the DVD version.

Advice: Throw out the first disc, and just keep the extended cut with the alternate ending. Extended cut is a much more spiritually faithful adaptation from the original I Am Legend book by Richard Matheson. The ending really does improve the quality of the film THAT much, and it makes you question why they even changed it in the first place.

Video and audio quality was exactly as expected, and met every expectation.",1482105600,16,449,4.818181818181818

Without giving away a spoil;er, it has a ""happily ever after"" tone that none of the previous cinematic incarnations have had, nor does the literary work. I understand movies are different than the literature they are base upon. I get it, but this honestly, would have relegated a fairly good movie to the basement collection...too much Will Smith playing Will Smith...none of the swaggering narcissism of Charlton Heston or the creepy self loathing of Vincent Price...and the smarmy ending...no thank you...the worst incarnation of this literary masterpiece yet...",1480896000,,729,5.3478260869565215

1597379,5,B00005JPTK,"This movie is a dramatic beat in a survival story. Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a virologist investigating a genetically engineered cure for cancer that has gone very, very terrible. With most of the worlds population wiped out and a small remnant turned into ravenous, infected carriers, Neville ekes out a lonely existence with only a dog for company in the remains of New York City, hunting, foraging, and exploring by day and shutting himself in at night. The infected, as it turns out, are vulnerable to ultraviolet light.
Through flashbacks we see how Neville came to be in this predicament, and how he dedicated himself to finding a cure. Part of that involves capturing infected humans for testing. In doing so, he incurs the wrath of one of the local CHUDs and Neville soon finds out that these creatures are not as dumb as they look.
At first, the film wrings plenty of scares out of Nevilles encounters and does a good job of revealing the monsters bit by bit, but once displayed, their CGI-ness is hard to ignore. By the time they're in full-on assault mode, they resemble nothing so much as zombified versions of the I, Robot androids, right down to their wall-scaling and coordinated attacks. This makes for exciting action sequences, but dials down the horror quotient considerably.
Smith, for his part, does a superb job of communicating the pathos and desperation of the last man on Earth. His slow disintegration into madness is subtly evoked, and in one particularly emotional scene he handles one of the most tired clich&eacute;s of the zombie genre with genuine depth.",1479686400,,1593,4.881918819188192

1597450,5,B00005JPTK,"I am Legend isn't just any usual zombie movie. This movie will scare you out of your pants and then make you cry the next scene. Will Smith goes above and beyond in this heart wrenching horror film. The movie has many positive aspects and will keep you hooked until the very end.

There are reasons why this movie is unlike any other sci-fi movie. The story line is very unique and unheard of. A doctor named Robert Neville (Will Smith) stays behind in the infected New York City in hopes of finding a cure for the disease before it wipes out the population. Smith and his dog Sam live in a home with high security located in the completely deserted city. Dr. Neville has a lab in the basement of the house with lab rats, as well as zombies that he does testing on after trials with the rats. Robert undergoes many challenges and situations that lead out to a great ending.

The set of the movie is very well done.  I am Legend was filmed in New York City. Being a city that is so populated, they made it seem like there hadnt been people living there for 20 years. From cars piled up on cars to tall grasses growing in the dead center of the city, this was quite an incredible set. The hazy gloominess of the city added an eerie feeling to the set. The city was as dark and depressing as one might expect it to be without a single soul living there.

On top of an amazing set, the animation and creation of the zombies was seamless. Without overdoing it, the zombies were made to look exactly what I would imagine zombies to look like if they were real. The skin of the creatures was grey, but had many veins showing through. An interesting aspect added to the zombies created was that the sunlight was deadly to them. Still having the usual superpower strength and resistance, they are more realistic than any other zombie I have seen.

Another aspect of the movie was the performance of the actors. Will Smith as usual was outstanding, and his dog Sam was just as great. You can feel exactly what he is feeling the entire movie. The intense emotions are displayed in his body language and facial expressions in a way that will give you goosebumps. During one scene I was just staring at his lips because he did such a good job showing his pain through them. Alice Braga playing the role of Anna did a great job coming in during the last few scenes of the movie as one of the few survivors of the virus. She comes into the picture right as Will Smith is entering his death, and becomes this figure of strength and hope that continues until the end of the movie.

I am Legend was a completely satisfying movie in every way. The movies views went from hundreds of zombies running at you to scenes that left me with tears in my eyes. The movie thrived through the set, acting, plot and all around creation. The maker turned a zombie apocalypse movie into an unforgettable zombie apocalypse movie, and thats hard to do.",1475539200,,2917,4.372693726937269

I did NOT like the ending at all...hate when movies end badly, and this was one of them. Have watched many times, and it's a part of my collection of growing DVD'S. Be careful watching with children if they are afraid of monsters or anything. My 12 and 14 year old children are scared of almost all creepy creatures and such, so I warn them before watching; they did not have to leave the room for this one though. I myself have watch TONS of monster/alien type movies since I was very young (41 now) and I was NEVER scared of these type of movies. I was PETRIFIED of any movies with ghosts, or demons and the like...such as Poltergeist, The Exorcist, Halloween, as these seemed so much more likely to actually happen in real life.

Apparently not...they had to use cheesy video game-esque zombies that are beyond fake looking and not scary at all.

The pacing of the movie just felt disjointed at the end of it. It feels like the movie is starting to pick up and then abruptly it ends in a kind of predictable, cliched way.

I'm really fascinated by elements of it but put off by others like the CGI and Will Smith. It feels to me like a big budget friendlier version of the brilliant 28 Days Later.

 Anyway I recently came across the two disc DVD steelbook of this for $2 with the promise on the sticker on the cover of a controversial alternate ending that was only seen in theatres. I watched this version last night and although I like the movie I thought this alternate ending was garbage.

 The original ending isn't great either but come on one of these out of control zombie mutants has the ability to smear a butterfly on the glass and stand there controlling his supposed uncontrollable lust for blood whilst Will Smith comes out and slowly brings back this guy's love interest. And then he takes her and he and his minions just leave and walk off all settled. No dice. But I still really like about the first 2/3 of the movie.

1598099,3,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith is a good actor and carries this movie well.  The film also does a good job of setting up the atmosphere, but slowly starts to lose focus during the middle and rushes toward the end.  It would have been better if this was a 2 or 3 part movie.  A prologue explaining how Smith became the last man standing in NYC and then the 2nd/3rd one fulfilling the overall meaning of I Am Legend while still retaining that awesome atmosphere.  I think I am more disappointed then anything because it had so much promise and left several things unanswered.  Regardless of whether the theatrical or dvd/bluray ending is cannon, they both end up lukewarm.

Despite my criticism towards it, this movie is still the best adaptation (The Last Man On Earth 1964, The Omega Man 1971) to date based on the novel.",1459900800,,801,4.527777777777778

1599812,5,B00005JPTK,"Will smith stars as Colonel Robert nevllie in this new Updated remake of the 1973 film THE OMEGA MAN
which is based on the I am Legend novel by Richard matheson
this new version story of I am Legend is about 50% based on the Novel
first of all this new version is filmed in New York city, where is the Omega man was filmed in Los Angeles
and the city from the novel is in Los Angeles not New York
but the rest of the films adapation of the novel seems to be true to the Novel

Will smith does play a brilliant Portrayal of Colonel Robert neville as he tries desperatly to find a cure for the Plague ridden world
there are some scenes throughout the film where Robert neville has flashbacks
of himself, his wife and son trying to escape the city just before all Hell breaks loose
Robert manages to get his wife & son on a Helicopter to escape but the Helicopter is shot down by a missile
from the Military, very scary and tragic.
and that's when Robert becomes the last man to survive and the only survivor in New york
pretty Damn scary updated version i must say,
the way and how Director Frances Lawrence shot the film in New york is incredible,
New york city looks like a Ghost town for sure, very frightening and scary
the Director & Producers of the film must've gone to Great lengths to block off alot of streets
cause it really does look like a Ghost town on film, completely Deserted

there's 2 versions of this film that the Director has officially released on Blu-ray & DVD
there's the original Theatrical version & the Alternate theatrical version,
both versions go for the same runtime of 100mins, the Alternate version has the exact same scenes as the original version
the only Difference really is the last 5min ending of the film just before credits come up
as you know in the last scene of the Laboratory in the original Theatrical version
Robert gives a Glass tube sample of blood to Anna (Alice braga) and tells her and
Ethan to escape through back door passage way to the street
while he stays to be attacked and killed by the Vampires/zombies whatever you want to call them
and then Anna & ethan drive to the place where there's more survivors and then credits come up

in this so called Alternate theatrical version which isn't really, only the ending scene is different
instead of Robert giving a Glass tube sample of blood to Anna in his laboratory
he persuades one of the Vampires to calm down saying that he can cure you
so he can give him his vampire wife back that he was doing tests on to find a cure
so Robert convinces the Vampires to calm down as he pushes out the trolley bed with the vampire wife lying on it
back to the male vampire
the male vampire picks up his Wife and walks out carrying his wife out of the laboratory
and then Robert leaves with Anna & Ethan, all 3 of them drive off in the car to the place where's there's more survivors
and then credits come up
i think both versions are Good,
either you want to see Robert neville Alive at the end of the film or you want to see him be killed by the vampires
and only Anna & Ethan escape to live, it's personal preference really.

there's lots of special features,
CREATING I AM LEGEND-1 hour Documentary
which are small featurettes that can be played altogether at once or played seperatly
interviews with Francis Lawrence, Will smith , Alice braga, Charlie Tahan
2nd unit Director Vic Armstrong and more interviews with other behind the scenes crew

I still love the Omega man adaption with Charlton Heston
this new updated version is not to bad, this new updated version is more scarier thou than the classic 1973 version
but it's still personal preference really, you either prefer the old 1973 classic or you prefer this new updated version
or you like both
5 stars i gave it",1422662400,3,3770,4.403156384505022

1599987,1,B00005JPTK,"If your film is going to rely heavily on the individual talents of an actor whose voice still cracks when he yells, don't expect the audience to take that willing suspension of disbelief that said actor is supposed to have survived an apocalyptic dying-off of the majority of the human race.

I'm not trying to burst bubbles, but Will Smith has been given role-after-role in which he is expected to dramatically portray a non-comedic character. So, at what point do obtuse hollywood execs realize that Will couldn't act his way out of a phone booth? This is the basic problem when an actor like Smith is expected to (to a great extent) carry a film that has few other main characters. And no, graying his hair and coaching him to grimace a lot isn't a substitute for actual role portrayal and character exploration. The best I can say about his stunted performance in this film, is that at least he waited to reach his zenith of laughably-horrible acting in ""Seven Pounds."" My word, his death scene at the end of that film had me laughing hysterically for the rest of the day. Thanks, Will.

Aside from Smith's typically-bland portrayal, the writers figured that making the underground denizens acrobatic olympians would really spice-up the plot advancement. It didn't. In fact, it added absolutely no suspense whatsoever. And unlike ""The Omega Man"" -- where the antagonists teamed-up and hated Charlton Heston because he was NOT effected by the disease -- these enemies were just wiry, energetic and really pissed at Dr. Neville.  Did the team of monkeys that wrote this script in their own feces stop for a second to realize how thin and flimsy this idiotic adaptation would be? I do credit Will for artificially advancing Willow Smith's career by being the stereotypical, over-aggressive parent and casting her in a (thankfully) brief role in the film as... (wait for it!) his daughter! Oh, the magic of hollywood!",1419379200,5,1917,4.874233128834356

I find it very interesting that one of the brownstones on the north side of Washington Sq. park was so conveniently outfitted as a complex bio research lab when in actuality they're basically offices and residences; but I suppose we have to take that Hollywood leap of faith into the realm of highjacking logical and artistic liberties.
Frankly I'm really bored to tears and despise the zombie craze phenomenon but Will Smith is a sensitive and very gifted actor; and fortunately the focus is on his character (not the virus infected zombies).
Will Smith's humanity really shines in this film, so it's easy to overlook the zombie silliness which is kept at a sane minimum.

That only works within the context of the original narrative.",1415145600,,357,4.507692307692308
1600314,1,B00005JPTK,Loved the original. This ending sucks. thought it would have the original as well as the alternate ending. It doesn't.,1414800000,,118,4.95
1600315,4,B00005JPTK,"There has been three films made over the years based on the Richard Matheson's novel ""I Am Legend"". The 1964 version ""The Last Man On Earth"" with Vincent Price, the 1971 ""Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston and 2007 version with the same title as the book starring Will Smith. This review will look at the 2007 version.

While this version is the same title as the novel it is based on the movie is loosely based on the book. But considering the other two film versions are loosely based on the book that isn't a strike against it. The plot to the film is pretty much the same as the other two with slight variations to the story. In this version Will Smith is Robert Neville, a brilliant scientist who was looking for a cure for cancer and in the process creates a virus that turns the world into infected mutants. Neville is immune to the virus and believes he is the last man on earth. He spends his days roaming the streets of New York looking for food and possibly anyone else out there who might be immune to the deadly virus. And of course he has to make sure he is back home before it is dark out because waiting in the darkness are those mutants just waiting to kill Dr. Neville.

The delight in watching this movie is the excellent job Smith does as an actor in this. Will Smith has come a long way from his days as a rap artist to being ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" to becoming a fine film actor. This is not his best performance as an actor but is definitely one of his best and Smith makes it worth while to spend the time watching this movie. As is the case with Vincent Price in ""Last Man On Earth"" and Charlton Heston in ""Omega Man"" Will Smith is pretty much the only actor you see in the movie until that point in the story he realizes he is not the only human left on earth. Until that point Smith has to carry the story all on his own and even for the most veteran actor that isn't an easy thing to do. But like Price and Heston before him Will does it as you get caught up in what his life is like since the virus has been accidentally unleashed on the world. The best part during all this is the interaction of the only companion Smith has, his dog Sam. Sam is the last link Dr. Neville has with the past before the world turned upside down and their bond is special as both look out for each other. It does lead to the saddest part of the movie that could lead even the hardened individual in tears.

If I have any complaints with this version it would be the same as what a couple of other reviewers have mentioned. The mutants in this movie are created using CGI technology. As a result as has been previously mentioned in the other reviews these mutants have a cartoonish look to them that doesn't quite give them the menacing look to that I am sure the director would have wanted. I am sure this was a money saving decision to do this. Why spend money hiring actors when we can computer generate the mutants was probably their thinking. Still it doesn't take away too much from the movie and still worth watching.

With this one I have now written reviews for all three film versions made of Richard Matheson's book ""I Am Legend"". Which of the three do I think is the best? Well I am a little partial to the first version with Vincent Price because I am such a fan of his. But then I am also a big fan of Charlton Heston so I am also a little partial to ""Omega Man"". But then I am a fan of Will Smith too so..... Well really I like all three equally. They are all well made with their own special twists to the story so its not quite the same thing no matter which version you may be watching. The best thing to do is watch all three versions yourself and decide. You may end up like me unable to decide which version is your favorite.",1414713600,,3758,4.157967032967033

1600748,5,B00005JPTK,"Fabulous movie. I was blown away by Will Smith's acting, though it was expected judging from his former roles in 7 Pounds and others. This movie was masterfully created so that you have sympathy for the characters--both minor and major--as they make their way through a mutation infested New York. There will be spoilers ahead.
Robert Neville (Will Smith) is a colonel in the army, and is put on duty in New York to find out what had caused the outbreak of a rabies-like virus called Krippin.
As Robert makes his way to the harbors to get his family to safety, his words are. ""This is ground zero, this is my site.""
This movie is layered with Will Smith's passionate acting, a sense of suspension, and an ultimate sympathy for a man alone with only his dog Samantha to accompany him.
Great music, great screenplay, great writing. Congratulations Will Smith, you just made my top five favorite actors.
Francis Lawrence also does a great job as a director, and I look forward to seeing more of his work.
This movie will blow you away, and though the ending might leave you guessing, I would recommend this to anyone who cares for a true, heartfelt story, told by the lips of a man who fights his way to faith and family.",1405468800,,1218,4.540909090909091

It was originally released in  1964 as The Last Man on Earth, and again in 1971 as The Omega Man (with Charlton Heston.)  The Charlton Heston version is probably the most famous, but it is much darker & bloodier than Will Smith's.  Since I wish my SciFi to be optimistic, I prefer Will Smith's version.  Yes, it is still about a killer virus that wipes out ALL of Earth's population except for the hero, but ... Well, just watch them all & see for yourself.",1404777600,,523,4.19

1600822,5,B00005JPTK,"Every so often, a movie is made where you simply cannot take your eyes off the screen.  Or, breathe.  Or, go to the bathroom.  Or, get up to make popcorn.  This is one of those films.

The filmmaker here carefully crafts his scenes to create nail-biting suspense-- it's artfully and brilliantly done.

Will Smith is his usual strong presence.  Most of the movie, he is alone in the scene and he carries that task beautifully.

See this movie for the dog, Sam.  This animal has such a powerful presence on screen--probably unlike anything you've ever seen.

**Really want to be freaked out?? Pay close attention to the very opening scene where the doctor is being interviewed on a news show.  Then see what's next.  Probably one of the most quietly stunning opening 5 minutes I've ever seen in a film.

**Suggestion:  Watch it at night with all of the lights out in your house for full effect.

Kid Factor:  Some intense and scary scenes-- a few bloody moments.  Might be too frightening and disturbing for young children.  Probably good for 13 and up.",1404000000,6,1051,4.6502732240437155

I love the Action, Drama, Science Fiction and special effects in all his movies.  This movie was no different.  Another great zombie flick for the times.  The special effects including the creation of an apocalyptic Manhattan and ""zombies"" were incredibly well done and hair raising.  The drama of the pandemic unfolding and how the main character is involved makes for a great storyline.  An action packed, suspensful, fight for survival, while trying to find a cure.

Bluray it depends on the Movie. as many should know many bluray movies had to be redone, because they were reconditioned so poorly.

1601009,5,B00005JPTK,"As the title of the review states, if you're a literature perfectionist then just don't bother since it's going to taint your view of the movie.  Otherwise, it deserves every star provided.  That being said, I've read the novel, I read it before the movie came out, and I loved it.  However, this representation of the movie is a goodly distance removed from the novel, enough so that I'm considering it loosely based and not responsible for the differences.  It would be like saying well, 10 Things I Hate About You didn't follow Taming of the Shrew to a tee.  It's too far removed from the original to be so comparative.

Now that that justification is out of the way, personally, I find this to be a superb film.  It's main protagonist, a military man immune to the disease that has killed everyone globally and contaminated the rest into what are called ""Dark Seekers"".  A zombie-vampire equivalent that has heightened aggression, stamina, and rage.  Robert Neville is left with his dog, a German Shepherd named Sam, to face an empty New York City.  He survives well enough, though his mental state is strained from lack of social contact, while simultaneously trying to create a cure from his blood to fix the Dark Seekers.

Not only is the story riveting and compelling, especially with such a small cast, but the little intricacies of the film are absolutely stunning.  With shots of gas stations with $7 price per gallon tags, hoards of money left to sit, forgotten, in abandoned buildings, and the primal development of NYC and the dystopia it finds itself in is brilliant.  It isn't a hard stretch of the metaphor to see the clear implications of humans tampering with medicine and how, like most end-of-the-world films, we will be the cause of our greatest demise.

Again, as a stand alone movie loosely based off of a novel from many years past, it is a great story and a great visual representation of dystopic, metaphorically accurate devolution of humans and the future.",1395619200,,1985,4.766081871345029
1601010,4,B00005JPTK,I enjoyed everything about the theatrical release of this movie up to the last 10-15 minutes. The alternate ending available on the Blu-Ray brings the moral of the story much more in line with Matheson's intent.,1395360000,,211,4.888888888888889

For me, I grew pretty tired of this essentially one-person movie as, unlike a movie like Castaway, little seemed to happen that made me really give a crap. There were a couple of bonding moments of Will Smith's character with his dog but few and far between that I really didn't get a sense of the dog being much more value to him than as the sole other living companion and not a best friend. Even the dealings with the mutants were so far and between that I felt like I could grab a bite to eat at the local restaurant, go out for a drink or two and come back and not miss much. I am not saying no one will like this movie. I just think with what is out there it doesn't warrant more than two stars.

Will Smith does a ""Will Smith"" job in the film and I can't say much bad about it, but I would be very excited to see someone do a film based on the original book, keeping the tone the same and sticking to the plot a little closer.

1601232,5,B00005JPTK,"""I am Legend"" is one of the great science fiction films from the last 10 years.  It begins with a probable discovery and cure for cancer.  The film leads the viewer to believe that there is peace and hope in the world for once.  Imagine planet Earth as one big flowering utopia where world scientists have finally solved perhaps the greatest enigma since the genesis of mankind. Now flash forward three years later and the virus once thought to be the unexplained, supernatural  cure for a disease that infects 1 out of 3 people-genetically mutates and destroys the entire human race (or most of it as we shall see).  What's left of humanity are piled bodies or flesh eating zombies. The film follows ""The Last Man on Earth"", famed virologist, armed services lieutenant and sole survivor Robert Neville (Will Smith) on his final quest to save all of humankind.

The film was beautifully scripted and an excellent adaptation of Matheson's 1954 horror novel of the same name.  The CGI and cinematography was simply brilliant and what a fantastic transfer Warner Brothers made onto Blu-ray. The editing was spot on and not a dull or unimportant moment went by that felt odd or unexplained.

One of the scenes that haunts me the most is when Neville is forced to strangle his closest companion -a female German Shepherd- after she defends him against the flesh-eating undead.  At the time his latest tests are unsuccessful and there isn't a cure to save her. The scene closes with him crying and holding her in his arms in a chemical lab below his apartment. It was particularly emotional for me because at that point in the film the dog was the only friend he had.

I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't had a chance to see it, but it ends beautifully and the viewer is left awestruck by what is left behind and what they have just witnessed.",1387324800,,1848,4.641104294478527

This version had the ending I was not familiar with and I was not expecting it. Without spoiling it, it negatively affected the entire build up of the movie. The ending I was used to was very emotional and actually depressing. It was not a feel good ending, but it was an emotional experience that I appreciated. The alternate ending is a feel good ending which makes no sense and contradicts the entire plot of the movie.

1601326,4,B00005JPTK,"This is a good movie, highly unlikely and sad at times, but it's an original. The film is based on the book ""I Am Legend"", a science-fictiony, thriller/horrorish novel. My adjectives aren't great, but basically the story follows Robert Neville, a lieutenant colonel and virologist through post-apocalyptic struggles.

In the beginning of the movie, a news clip is shown where a doctor is interviewed saying she believes the cure for cancer has been found, and has so far killed all cancer in over 1000 patients. A few months later, it seems that the virus used to kill cancer in these subjects has actually taken over their bodies; increased aggression is one of the many side effects that constitute a condition best described as evil-zombieism. The virus also spreads from person to person, but fortunately for Robert Neville, he appears to be one of few or none immune to the virus.

For some time the government puts it's too scientists to work on a cure, but when the outbreak surges a cure has not been found. Neville and his family live in New York, where the bridges are to be blown for quarantine purposes. He says goodbye to his wife, daughter, and her puppy, Sam, as they are loaded into a helicopter to be taken from the island. Robert stats behind to concentrate on finding a cure, and at the last minute his daughter hands him Sam to keep him company. It's a good thing because soon he will be the only human left in Manhattan as the city is taken over by zombies.

Over the next few years, Robert and Sam have a routine they practice which includes foraging, hunting, searching for survivors and searching for a cure, as well as protecting themselves against the horrors in the shadows. While the movie is horror in genre, it is also quite tragic. Neville falls deeper into the sorrow of pain and loss and loneliness. Will Smith does an excellent job of understating the mental trauma Neville experiences, but expresses it in a way that feels very real. For the remainder of the film, the search for a cure continues as the threat of death by zombie nears. I won't ruin any surprises but I really think this is a good movie, but be aware that it is very very sad and not easily shrugged away. I hope this review helps.",1382400000,3,2233,4.591478696741855

1601382,4,B00005JPTK,"As a huge fan of Richard Matheson's famous novella, I Am Legend, this film sticks closer to the original material than the previous I Am Legend film adaptations (starring Vincent Price in one and Charlton Heston in the other). The book and film are about Dr. Neville (who also works for the government) believing himself to be the lone survivor after a worldwide catastrophe. Like many end-of-the-world themes Neville finds others while fighting off the dead who have risen again. The book is still regarded as one of the Top 3 vampire/zombie stories of all time. This film depicts the zombies as fairly brainless but they are chillingly effective. Will Smith does a good job of portraying the flawed hero who struggles to keep his spirits up. I have known people who shrink away at some of the zombie scenes in this movie. The special effects work well and don't dominate the story. If you like end of the world themes and zombies (e.g. 28 Days Later) then this will be a great flick.

The view of a deserted New York looks great, Will Smith can carry the whole movie easily on his shoulders (there are few survivors after all), and this is likely the best version available of the original novel. The other film versions are great in their own way but have dated costumes and effects. If you like this film then see The Omega Man and The Last Man on Earth which are the earlier adaptations of I Am Legend. The only downsides are that zombies age quickly (seen Night of the Living Dead lately?) and this film is no exception. Also, the dark ending turns some people off (love it).

The picture and audio quality are superb. There are 94-minutes of special features included on the Blu-Ray: Creating I Am Legend, Cautionary Tale: The Science of I Am Legend and 4 animated comics: Death as a Gift, Isolation, Sacrificing the Few for the Many, Shelter.

1601416,3,B00005JPTK,"I am Legend(released Dec/07)stars,among others,Will Smith,Alice Braga and Charlie Tahan. This is a film that should have been better than it was,but it's slow pace and erratic plot coupled with computer generated zombies that look TOO phony,all work against it.
The story finds Smith as a doctor who lives a solitary existence in New York City,along with his German shepard,Sam. Through back story telling we find he had a wife and a daughter. He was one of a team that were responsible for developing a cancer cure. Much of the human population was inoculated,only for most to come down with a deadly virus that killed them. The others that weren't killed turned into light sensitive zombies,who came out at nightfall. Smith has been continuing to work on a cure in his basement lab,but with no success. His daily routine is monotonous,as his search pattern spreads out little by little each day through the city streets. He also makes his usual rounds to pick up necessities at various spots.
One day comes which changes everything. His dog runs into a darkened building in which he has to enter to get him. With zombies inside waiting for the dark,he barely manages to escape with Sam alive. He captures one and takes it back to his lab for testing. The next day he discovers a dummy from a store he frequents,sitting down at the dead end of an entirely different street. It is a trap,and before he is able to respond he is suspended above the street by a trip wire. The sun is going down and he finally manages to get loose and fall to the ground,but accidentally impales himself on his knife. Before he can reach his car he and Sam are attacked by zombie dogs which bite Sam.
Back at Smith's home and lab Smith injects Sam with a relaxant,but Sam soon turns. Smith is forced to kill his companion in his arms. Wanting revenge Smith deliberately heads out in the dark and confronts the zombies at a pier. He manages to take down a few,but he is soon overpowered. He is upside down and helpless in his car when a bright light illuminates the area. He is rescued by another survivor with a child. They return to Smith's place. The new survivor wants Smith to come with her to a place she has heard is not infected,but he remains adamant to stay and find a cure. Checking his captured zombie he finds he has finally found the cure,as the zombie's symptoms are slowly disappearing. That night the zombies come a calling right to Smith's house and they storm it. Smith and company are forced into a sealed glass area at one end of the basement,but the head zombie deliberately,and with a purpose Smith had heretofore denied,continually slams against the glass,trying to break it. Smith sends his two new friends out through an escape tunnel,while he stays to deal with what lies ahead.
The zombies finally break the glass and just as they enter,Smith lets go with a grenade which completely destroys everything. The film ends as his two new companions finally make their way to the safe haven that was mentioned earlier. The vaccine Smith created was given to her and she hands it over to the heads of the population within the walled city.
One point that bothers me about the film is that Smith never acknowledges or seems to realize at any time,that the zombies are actually more than air heads. He never cottons on to the fact that the zombies could think,let alone seek revenge as they started to do when they trapped him by enticing him with a dummy he encounters everyday. He never asks who moved it or why. It never seems to occur to him the reason the zombie behaviour changed so drastically was because of his capture of the mate to the leader of a group of them. For a supposedly smart guy,he was pretty dumb. That said,Smith does have some good acting moments,especially his killing of his beloved Sam. It just wasn't enough however to elevate this film to anything than average,at best. The CGI zombies just look too phony. I think the film makers spent most of their budget on their star and had to resort to CGI instead of prosthetic make up. The whole feel of the film would have been far superior had the zombies been real people,ala Resident Evil. Emma Thompson has an all too brief cameo as a doctor being interviewed on a TV screen at the beginning.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Since the film is descended from the comics,there are four animated comics included with the DVD.
All in all the film is a slow moving one,with CGI zombies that look so phony,one cannot suspend their disbelief for any more than two seconds. Smith tries his best,but what should have been a home run,turned into a walk to first base.",1375488000,,4682,4.594982078853047

The two or three flashback sequences seem to tell us very little, catch us off guard and basically ruin the flow of the movie. 'I am legend' is one of those films that looks real promising in the trailers but delivers a much less admirable experience in reality. There are some nice touches effects wise, but even these looked more promising in the trailers. Will Smith turns in a better than average performance, but somehow this movie is so uneven and dull that he seems dull at times. There are a few clever moments here and there, and some slightly creepy ones, but the whole thing seemed to end too fast. I was hoping for the grand finale that never really happens. This is a film built to feel like a big budget blockbuster, but at just about 90 minutes the final credits roll, and the whole thing seems rushed to end, and what ever the trailer led me to believe never came to light.

This movie has been a favorite of mine, since I bought the DVD about four years ago.  Now being able to get a Blu Ray Version, for less than a third of what I paid for the DVD at the time, you bet I jumped at the chance!

For those of you who have yet to see this movie, expect to see Will Smith at his best.  He carries the movie solo for an hour... and quite well.  Granted, the CGI effects lack a bit, it does not take anything away from the overall quality of the camera work, and acting of not only Will Smith, but his Canine friend ""Sam.""

If you like Will Smith, End of the world scenarios, non stop action, Zombies, and even have a story to follow, give it a shot.

Honestly, it is just a great movie.  Do your homework. Read up on the reviews. Maybe watch a trailer, or rent it to be sure it is your speed.... I am guessing since you are here, you have already made up your mind.

You won't beat the price, and good luck finding it in stores.

Thanks Amazon!",1371168000,,1226,4.04149377593361
1601484,5,B00005JPTK,"This is a unique story. Scientists think they find a viral cure for cancer, and like other viruses it can jump from person to person (aside from the few with immunity). The unintended side effects are the people it does not kill outright turn into vampires. Smith's character is alone (aside from his dog) in New York City, trying to find a cure for the virus.

Smith does a great job playing a guy who is clearly going crazy from being by himself for three years, yet, is brilliant in his moments of lucidity when he works on the cure. It is one of the better acting jobs he has done in his career. The reason I like the alternate version is that it fleshes out the story of whether the vampires are becoming sentient beings vs just mindless killing machines. It really goes deeper into the ethical dilemma of whether it is right to ""cure"" them. It is a question that the film does not really answer in either version, but it does make you think.

Apparently the movie diverges a lot from the source books, which upset a lot of fans. If that is something that would take away from your enjoyment of the movie, then you should probably skip this. If however you are a fan of Will Smith the sci-fi kind of dramas and stories (especially ones that do make you think some) and can let the movie stand on its own, you will probably find this enjoyable. My only real gripe with the film is the fact that they made the vampires CGI. I do not think that there was a big need to do so, and the film could have been even more effective if you put real actors in that role.",1370736000,2,1563,4.241610738255034

1601613,5,B00005JPTK,"I never heard of, much less read, the book upon which people say this film is based. It makes not the slightest bit of difference to me nor should it to anyone else. It seems hardly necessary, after more than a century of film-making, to say that the cognitive impact of a movie is far different from that of a book. A book read  by one's  eyes is far different from a book read by a live actor, or, as I have come to learn from a great many hours of listening, a well constructed robotic voice. (Incidentally, the exasperated remark by Astaire was made to the surviving member of a dance team which Fred and Ginger were portraying on film; she kept interrupting the proceedings with complaints to the director and the actors, to the effect that something was not as they had lived it. The film: The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle-1939.)
As to this picture, Will Smith does a fine job carrying the show on his shoulders. The 'monsters' are suitably vicious and possessed of superior impact because used with discretion. The setting is admirably representative of what NYC might look like. With a bit of slippage at the end (specifying would reveal too much of the plot) the creators maintain an internal logic which lends movie rationality to most of the events.

This enhances the CGI shots of post-apocalyptic New York City.  As some other reviewers have pointed out, the CGI characters look a bit cartoonish.  It is not so much the appearance that troubled me, however, but rather they way they move.  They run, jump and attack at speeds that defy physics--like the early Spiderman movies.  This makes it all the more obvious that they are CGI.  Apart from that quibble, I enjoyed the movie very much--more than I did the first time I saw it in the theater.

1601707,4,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is a movie based on a 1954 novel by Richard Mathewson. It is the 3rd movie adaption of the novel.

The CGI is decent -- we see a decaying NYC with weeds growing through the streets and a completely empty Times Square and Grand Central Station. Some people have complained about the rate of decay, but that is a bit trifling.

It's a difficult acting task -- Will Smith is only accompanied by a dog for the first half of the movie. The viewer gets a glimpse of what it would be like both intellectually and emotionally if one were the last human on Earth.

The movie was made in 2007. The background is that cancer is cured in 2009, but the side effects of the cure causes a horrific new virus that wipes out 99% of the world population. Equally awful, 99% of the 1% that survives is infected and they attack the remaining survivors. It is now 2012 and Richard Neville has been working for the past 3 years to find a cure.

1601743,4,B00005JPTK,"Finally, an end of the world thriller that is worth seeing! This remake of 1971's Omega Man is a perfect example of how end of the world movies should occur. The flashbacks to the time before the catastrophe tell the story of what actually happen. Will Smith is really great as Dr. Robert Neville. Instead of going on some insane journey to find an unaffected area, he stays right in the heart of the crisis and tries to fix it. He is a great example of a true hero and Will Smith portrays it perfectly. Smith's personality in a dark and somber movie is a bright spot and his interplay with the innocuous things he encounters is fantastic. Will Smith make the film, aided by a great story and some really cool special effects. This is a good one!",1361577600,,746,4.374100719424461

1601747,4,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith delivers another performance so powerful that you can't help but stare in awe before you realize that you are crying.

The story was taken from Vincent Price's ""The Last Man on Earth"" which was later redone very popular with Charlton Heston in ""Omega Man.""  All 3 films are worth watching, but ""I am Legend"" changes the story in some powerful ways.

The initial CGI for NY city is amazing.  The digital craftsmanship is phenomenal.
Unfortunately the CGI that is front and center in the movie is painfully inadequate (especially on Blu Ray). Basically all living creatures were done poorly. They feel cartoony.

So, as long as you go in with the proper expectations about CGI, you can focus on the amazing story telling, plot, and acting.",1361145600,,748,4.8125

It is literally the worst movie I have EVER seen. I think because it was Will Smith I expected a little more. My severe disappointment in the story and confusion throughout the movie just ruined it. This movie could have been a little better if they did not save the flashbacks for the end of the story. Maybe in chronological order it would have been better. Still there were just too many unanswered questions. Also this was basically a zombie apocalypse movie. Had I known I would have NEVER watched. My husband found it on clearance in a discount bin and now we both can understand why. Maybe if I was a zombie apocalypse kinda girl, but sadly I am more of a logical realistic type. I won't give up on Will though I was raised with his Fresh Prince shenanigans and this is the first time I have not enjoyed his acting.

1601825,4,B00005JPTK,"Spoiler Alert!
While the movie veers from the book, (especially in the ending), this is perhaps the best post apocalyptic movie that I've seen in years, if not ever. Will Smith portrays a scientist who was responsible for finding a cure to a virus that had spread throughout the world.  This virus turned people (and animals) into a type of Zombie/Vampire. Unfortunately the good doctor didn't find the cure and civilization was pretty much destroyed.  I love that they showed a typical day in the life of this doctor. While the movie is packed with action created by the zombie/vampires, it takes the time to show how he survives from day to day. His existence is better than most survivors that are portrayed in these types of movies until an event occurs which throws him into a careless rage bringing his carefully crafted existence into dire jeopardy. I also love the zombie/vampire creatures.  They are quick, incredibly scary looking and intelligent.  They are the scariest virus victims of any movie that I've ever seen. I truly hope if anything like this ever occurs in real life that the monsters are nothing like the ones depicted in this film!  I am hoping for the slow, unthinking, unintelligent zombie of ""The Walking Dead"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"" - certainly not the kind depicted in this movie.",1358553600,,1316,4.8053097345132745

1601828,5,B00005JPTK,I've watched this several times and thought it was about time I bought it for real.  Looking forward to watching it many more.,1358035200,,126,4.478260869565218
1601829,5,B00005JPTK,"I loved I Am Legend the first time I saw it!  I loved it even more when I saw the version with the alternate ending, and that's pretty much the way I prefer watching it because I hated what happened to Will Smith in the end of the original version.

When this movie had first come out onto DVD and Blu-Ray, I initally picked up the DVD because I did not yet have Blu-Ray capabilities, but eventually I bought myself a PlayStation 3 and among one of the first movies I upgraded to Blu-Ray after a handful of classics was I Am Legend.

I'd been familiar with the ultimate collector's editions of the film but never bought one at the time, mostly because money was tight and they were a bit more expensive back then.  However, I finally broke down and decided to buy one of them.  I already owned the Blu-Ray copy, and for the longest time I had seen a DVD ultimate collector's edition set sitting up on top of a cabinet containing movie sets at a local entertainment store I frequent, and I would always eyeball it when I was in there.

Eventually the set hit $14.99, and a while later I had happened to have some Christmas movie & finally broke down and decided to buy it.  I loved that movie and I couldn't stand to see that cool set sit there and collect dust.  Having the Blu-Ray, I will always watch that, but I bought the set if nothing other than for pure nostalgia.  It has some cool collectibles and I just like owning it.

So yes, this is a bit more of a story as to how I came across this than an actual review, but review wise...if you are a fan of this movie, this collector's set, whether Blu-Ray or DVD, is pretty cool and it would be a cool collectible for anyone who enjoys this movie.  I think eventually I'm even going to try and incorporate my Blu-Ray copy into it, if I ever come across a slim enough case.  But yeah, totally cool set...I love it!",1357862400,,1866,4.225352112676056

1601944,5,B00005JPTK,"Much more appropriate plot resolution.  I suspect it was the ending originally written because the first ending did not explain the trapping by the devolved creature necessary to snag Col. Neville.  I also suspect that this ending is said to be ""controversial"" because it reveals truth about the nature of white people( a creature's nature is not sickness.) and because the black hero  did not sacrifice himself for white folks.  .At the same time the very end has him setting off in a quasi-romantic nature with a white woman at the end which I did NOT like and was a bunch of confusion..",1355270400,,589,4.689320388349515

It seems to dislocate the continuity and consistency of the film.  How would one feel after destroying all humans and creatures on Earth.  And when his best friend dies, he goes postal.  Anyway, was his escape a dream Or was his escape just a result of his mind fracturing or diverging.  So was the woman and child real or were they internal conflicts; his way of saving yet sabatoging himself?  Is there a right or wrong answer?",1350172800,5,592,4.36697247706422
1601999,3,B00005JPTK,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""I Am Legend"" starring Will Smith. I got it at Wal-Mart off the five-dollar rack. First of all, I was unaware of the movie or the book on which it was based. Second, my feelings for the movie are extremely mixed. First, my reaction to the discovery of a cancer cure which morphs into a rabies-like virus and wipes out the Manhattan population is skeptical, to say the least. Well, I know this is unadulterated fiction, so I'll try to give it some slack. But secondly, the depiction of Manhattan as a devastated city is exceptionally good and I'm left wondering how in the world did they ever do it? The streets are cluttered with cars as if everything was just abandoned after the sounding of an alarm. After three years, all the streets are overgrown with mature-sized weeds growing from cracks in the pavement wherever Smith might go, and he covers a lot of territory. The city looks completely abandoned and in bad decay. Well Done! Whoever put this together ought to get an award of some type. And, alas, from this as a start, I would expect a really good movie to follow.

Well, this well-crafted scene just doesn't hold up. Smith has an office-laboratory where he labors to save the world and it is fully electrified. Full lighted. All the machines work. It even has a working TV. And the computer works, including the internet. And his car works fine as he motors about the city, never getting low on gas, although he's been there three years. And he sends a broadcast out over the airwaves of the city ever day trying to find out if anyone else might be there. Huh? How could this be? It just doesn't wash. All of a sudden I find myself involved in a story I couldn't possibly believe. At about this point, there's the appearance of human-like monsters and monster dogs which are infected with a rabies-like virus and are insanely violent and after his hide. I'm sorry folks, the story just lost me totally and I just couldn't bear the last half.

The movie had promise. Too bad the last half wasn't up to the first half. As it is, I'd have to congratulate some of the special effects people (the NYC scene) and let the others know what an awful job they did (the monsters). What an incongruent mix! Who's responsible for this mess anyway?. Well, I'd have to say that Smith's acting was fairly good. My condolences to him for being stuck in such a preposterous script.

If you liked the original version then you owe it to yourself to watch this version.

1602083,4,B00005JPTK,"I know we're conditioned by the most action movies to expect a never-ending sequence of fights, explosions, and chase scenes.  This movie has few of these.  In fact, Will Smith's character is essentially alone (well, along with his German Shepherd) in a post-apocalyptic NYC wiped out by a mutating virus.  You might think this would make for a boring movie.  Some have found this movie to be that, but I did not.  The silent, self-reflective stretches of this movie give Dr. Neville (Will Smith's character) time to think, and we have time for that as well.  This makes for a richer experience, and makes me wonder if I've missed important thoughts or details in more action-packed movies, as I was carried along willy-nilly by the plot.  Obviously Will Smith's acting makes or breaks this movie; many could not carry a movie single-handedly the way this one requires.

What I liked:  Will Smith strikes just the right balance between courage in the face of danger, and self-deprecating humor.  You would have to be comfortable in your own skin if you were, literally, the last man on earth.  The CG images of a NYC destroyed and overgrown by decay were mesmerizing and realistic.  I also liked the many small details of what he would have needed to do to survive.  Yes, fight the zombies; but you've also got to eat, and take care of your stuff.  Suspense of battling the inhuman night-creatures was riveting.  Some did not like the ending (no spoilers) but I was fine with it.

What I didn't like:  In some ways not faithful to the book; but this was not a huge issue for me.  Others have felt that the plot got bogged down or derailed at times.  And extroverts would be disconcerted, and perhaps even bored, by the solitude of it all.  Most of the main character's witty dialog was with himself or his dog; not everone's kind of sci-fi movie.

It's true that it was not what many of us have been conditioned to expect from the Hollywood movie assembly line.  Maybe that's why I liked it.",1336262400,,1991,4.612535612535613

1602186,5,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend (2007)
Drama, Science Fiction, Thriller, 101 minutes
Directed by Francis Lawrence
Starring Will Smith and Alice Braga

Will Smith is one of the biggest box office draws, whether it's for action, comedy or drama. He has the charisma to pull off just about any role and is improving as a dramatic actor as he matures. I Am Legend contains some action, but it's a futuristic drama more than anything else. Smith is required to show considerable range.

The movie makes this list because it shows how people adapt in extreme situations. Robert Neville (Smith) is possibly the last man alive after a cure for cancer turns people into aggressive zombie-like creatures who live in the dark. He's a scientist and appears to have a natural immunity to the virus. He's trying to develop a vaccine that will help these creatures recover their humanity.

Imagine if you had an entire city to yourself. How would you spend your time? Neville has a routine. He wakes up at the same time each day, works out, and then systematically searches the buildings in the area for canned food and bottled water. This is vital for his survival. He also continues his research and tries out his vaccines on laboratory rats. In order to maintain the illusion that he's not alone, he watches recorded TV shows and talks to mannequins while he works his way through the inventory of a local video store. Every day at Noon, he waits at a predetermined location for any response to his radio messages offering hope and shelter to other survivors.

New York is an abandoned city. Grass has reclaimed most of the land and Neville has to compete with lions when he goes hunting for dear. The early special effects are very convincing and we are drawn in to Neville's world. Some of the exposition is achieved through showing Neville's dreams and we discover that his wife and daughter were evacuated along with the other healthy people left in the city. His only friend now is Sam, his dog. Unlike Neville, Sam can be affected by contact with the creatures roaming the city.

One of the saddest scenes in the movie comes after Sam is bitten by a creature carrying the virus. He injects her with serum in the hope that it will prevent her from transforming into a deadly version of his former companion. If you are an animal-lover, it's a hard scene to watch.

I won't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. Is Neville really alone? Will he develop a cure? If he does, will it even be possible to capture the creatures and successfully administer the cure?

The film raises a serious question; are humans the biggest threat to their own survival?

The Blu-ray includes an alternate ending. Both endings are hopeful, but one is considerably more hopeful than the other. The Blu-ray presentation is just about perfect.",1330473600,,2800,4.7

1602189,2,B00005JPTK,"I gave 3 stars instead of 1 because I really like this movie - Will Smith did an exceptional job, along with the rest of the cast.  Usually with remakes, I prefer the original but not in this case; and I really like Charlton Heston movies (referring to ""Omega Man"").  This remake did so much better with regard to action; what someone might go through mentally with the loss of family, let alone being the only person left on earth; and some reality with what you see in the background of the film.  So the film does well mixing some good drama and action enough to keep you from hitting the stop button because the science fiction part is so unrealistic.

However, this ""alternate"" ending sucked, to put it mildly.  I'm not going to give it away, but puh-leeze.  Okay, this movie IS science fiction, but this alternate ending kind of put it over the top as far as stupidity is concerned.

1602234,2,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is a virtual catalog of bad judgment.

Will Smith is disastrously miscast. He is supposed to be a military doctor of international renown, burdened by grief and guilt, isolated and obsessed to the point of dementia, a helpless witness to the dying of the human race - a death he believes he could have prevented.

Smith looks like a thirty-ish actor from Beverly Hills, impeccably groomed with a retinue of dieticians and personal trainers. When he talks to the German Shepherd we should see a lonely scientist on the brink of madness talking to the only companion he has left. Instead we see a successful Hollywood actor having fun with his dog.

When Smith is called upon to 'act', he is awful. You will long for the depth and gravitas of Ben Affleck.

Everything else is wrong, too. After decades of zombie movies to draw upon, you'd expect credible monsters. After decades of apocalyptic movies, you'd expect end-of-the-world set design and cinematography. And at the very least, a haunting score. I Am Legend falls short, by miles, on every count.

The script is a godawful mess.

They don't move like humans, and that makes them seem less threatening... distended jaws, leaps that defy gravity, etc. It wasn't necessary.

1602237,4,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is the third movie adaptation of the classic Richard Matheson.  I have neither read the book nor seen the earlier adaptations so this was my first exposure to the story.

Will Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville, the last man in New York City after a cancer cure gone horribly awry kills most of humanity and leaves most of the people left as what can best be described as vampire-zombies.  Dr. Neville is the rare immune and the even rarer survivor.  Smith is only actor on screen the vast majority of the film, so the film lives or dies by his performance.  Thankfully, it is virtuoso.

The strength of the film is the struggle of Dr. Neville, a military scientist, to find a cure for the virus while holding onto his own sanity.  I get stir crazy after three days without human interaction; Dr. Neville spends three years without human interaction.  All this after he sees everything he knew and loved burn away.  It makes for an emotionally brutal movie.

Sadly, it is the film's emotional resonance that caused me problems.  It got me to thinking about the movie, which is generally good, but I Am Legend is the kind of movie that doesn't stand up well to close examination.  There are logical holes you could drive a truck through.  Some of this can be chalked up to Dr. Neville's declining sanity, but it's still tough to swallow.  And it's the kind of thing that could have been tightened up with a little more care.

CGI is relied upon heavily, but is somewhat hit or miss.  A decaying, partially overgrown New York City is visually arresting and believable.  Apparently a lot of other people don't care for them, but, personally, I'm ok with how the vampire-zombies look.  The deer, on the other hand, were an unwelcome distraction (I kept wondering whether they were some sort of zombie-deer because, well, they didn't look very much like deer).

The DVD extras consist entirely of animated comics that take place in the world of I Am Legend parallel to the story of the film.  The comics are very artsy, emotionally gripping, and well written.  One in particular gives us a window into how the vampire-zombies see the world and surviving humans.  Review is of the Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)",1320019200,,2214,4.666666666666667

1602240,3,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is a decent movie, as far as big Hollywood productions with big stars go.  This Will Smith vehicle has some compelling moments, and Smith uses some of the acting chops that were a big, big deal in his Muhammad Ali biopic; however, as far as serving as a worthy adaptation of the Richard Matheson sci-fi classic - this version of I Am Legend falls woefully short.  Note: this is the third attempt to adapt Matheson's story to the big screen, with the first being The Last Man on Earth (1964) and the second being The Omega Man (1971).  Missing from this 2007, CGI-heavy version is the nihilism and psychological horror which, in the original story, inspired George Romero to create his cult-classic, Night of the Living Dead.  This version of Matheson's tale is simply too slick, too polished in the name of a big-time celebrity to succeed as a horror movie; and the plot is too thin and loosely interpreted to succeed as science fiction - so it resides firmly in the realm of entertainment, losing Matheson's apocalyptic message in the translation, and sanitizing the most dark and chilling parts of a great story.  I recommend this for a night where you are in the mood for a mild thriller without too much tooth or bite or need for brain; also, the violence here is pretty tame by contemporary standards, but it will still be too much for small children and complete scaredy-cats.",1319500800,3,1394,4.650406504065041

1602242,5,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is a movie and novel consisting of zombies, cancer, and a sunset. These ideas link and weave into each other throughout one man's journey to find an ultimate escape after the cure for cancer goes horribly wrong. Robert Neville, (played by Will Smith) and his German Shepard named Sam, must escape the wrath of the Darkseekers, the mutants inhabiting New York City, in order to escape to a colony with other immune survivors. This film is one of the most intriguing of this decade due to the insightful, yet haunting, peek into the future.
  As the story begins as a flashback in New York City, ambulance sirens are wailing as police control the crowds, and doctors check the health of passengers, hoping to escape the city onto helicopters. News reports of the cure for cancer were displaying on TVs within the city. A woman was reporting on the genetic mistake while finding the cure, informing that an epidemic is started. Robert Neville, a Lieutenant Colonel, is taken with his family into a truck, heading towards the landing pad for a helicopter. Neville is taken from his family on to a helicopter, escaping the virus and the city. He will never see them again. The helicopter soon crashes, and he is the only one left. Or so he thought.
As the mutant humans push forwards toward the injured protagonist and the hopeless dog, the sunset is what controls them. The shade from the sun slowly creeps toward the car as Neville hides behind, unable to walk. Now, the zombies are on edge, can already taste the blood. Growling erupts as they are ten feet away. Nine feet... eight feet... panic erupts on Neville's face as he clutches Sam, hoping the pain will not last long. Seven feet... six feet... they are clawing at the edge, prepared to pounce. Five... four... three... two... he clutches his fists as the hope is drained from his face. He puts his head down and the screen shows Sam being bitten and the mutants closing in on Neville. This is what the future could possibly look like, the reason why I Am Legend is such an on-the-edge movie.
  Later, Neville finds a woman and girl in an abandoned house. This foreshadows hope, but only for a short period of time. He captures a zombie and begins tests on it. Sam has been strangled to keep the emotional pain from Neville. As the others hide behind a safe, Plexiglas wall, Neville attempts to get the genetic combinations correct, yet isn't fast enough. The zombies find their way into the apartment. He runs in with the other two, and protects them in a secret room, as a mutant busts his head through the wall. Neville shuts the secret door to save the woman and girl, while he pulls a grenade from his pocket. The horde finally reaches through the wall and they rush forward. The pin is pulled and it is all over, only two remain.
  I Am Legend provides an easy, yet insightful read or watch. It shows an interesting twist on the future of our world. Solving a cure for cancer might not be the brightest idea we have had in years. Although it seems far-fetched, it proves a good point and is a dynamic movie. Some scenes are sad, some are action packed, and some force you to use your brain. Overall, this movie has concepts beyond our grasp, which twists reality into a fictional, frightening story.
  The movie also has many hidden lessons for people to help display their personality. It shows that teamwork can overcome much larger problems. This is displayed throughout the movie after the point of Neville finding the two others in the city. The movie also displays sacrifice for others resulting in survival of the horde after Neville pulls the pin. Finally, it shows a route of survival different from many ordinary ideas. To wrap things up, I Am Legend pulls an insightful twist on the future and a gruesome fictional reality.",1319328000,2,3808,4.631111111111111
1602243,3,B00005JPTK,"As with almost any literary adaptation, fans of the source material in search of a literal interpretation will probably find a lot to fault in this Will Smith vehicle, particularly in its neutered take on the story's conclusion. All of the original's deeper underlying meanings are still there, buried in the actions and expressions of the transfigured creatures Smith does his best to avoid, but without a big reveal to lay all the cards on the table they're too easily shrugged off or overlooked altogether. That positions this as, basically, a hybrid summer blockbuster / suspense-laden monster movie with a better than usual premise. In this role it fares well - Smith portrays the terrifying isolation of the last sane man on Earth with passion and depth, leaving memories of his less-inspired earlier work far in the past. He's come a long way from Independence Day or even Hancock, and surprisingly little of that has the more stern-faced, serious script to thank. Legend's computer effects are a different story: while exceptional at rendering an overgrown, deserted NYC skyline, they feel excessive and overwhelming when it come to the creatures themselves. Though it may not live up to the lofty expectations of its namesake, this is hardly a complete write-off. In fact, as mass market action pictures go it's unusually smart, expertly paced and generally contemplative. A pity it didn't have the balls to stick with that original ending, though, as I think it would have been much more universally appreciated.",1318204800,,1522,5.092

These concerns were at the same time confirmed and resolved by watching the version with the alternate ending.  I won't go into details, however, if you watch the alternate ending, you will notice that it not only changes how the movie ends but some of the central themes addressed by the movie (God, humanity and the ethics/possibility of a cure).

1602297,5,B00005JPTK,"I AM LEGEND is a masterful horror story.  The story opens with the television interview of a medical researcher (Emma Thompson) discussing how the measels virus has been genetically engineered to cure cancer.  Suddenly the film flashes to the haunting images of an abandoned and overgrown New York three years later.  Military officer and virus specialist Robert Nevile (Will Smith) prowls the streets with his dog by day scavenging and sending out messages for any survivors of the pandemic which swept the globe.  By evening, Nevil withdrawls to his fortified house/labratory carefully disguising his presence.  The cancer cure of course went horribly wrong with well over 5 billion people killed by the virus.  Hundreds of million more were mutated into ferocious nocturnal beings constantly in search of prey.

The film is action packed, melacholy, haunting, and at times very intense.  I would not recommend it for younger children due to the frightening scenes.  Smith shows off his considerable acting talent as his character exhibits a full range of human emotion.  The scenes of an abandoned New York with its blown bridges is haunting; especially memorable is a scene of Nevile golfing off an abandoned aircraft carrier.  Here the seemingly lone surviror stands dwarfed amidst the ruins of civilization.  It gets one thinking how fragile society can be.  Surprisingly some scenes are even emotionally powerful--especially the flashbacks of Nevile's  family being killed in the final flight from Manhattan before complete quaranteen went into effect.  The cinematography is also competent.

An interesting aspect late in the film differs considerably from Matheson's book (actually the film itself is far different from the novel).  The irony of the novel is that the character essentially demythologizes his vampire antagonists before ultimately becoming the basis of a legend for a new post-human society.  In this film version Nevile apparently rediscovers God's purpose for his life at the very end as he realizes what he can do for the surviving human society.  Although I won't go further into detail about the ending it is hopefully but not entirely happy.  I have read Matheson's novel, watched the Vincent Price ""Last Man on Earth"" and seen most of the Charleton Heston film ""The Omega Man.""  This update is my favorite interpretation of the story including the novel.  Although Heston was one of my favorite actors and I generally enjoy Vincent Price, I must say that Smith's performance as Nevile surpasses both in my opinion.

Overall a fine horror/action film which really transcends its genre into some effective drama.  I would not recommend it for children though.",1316304000,,2689,5.243559718969555
1602298,4,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend, directed by Frances Lawrence, is a good film when viewed as is, but it is a great film when you flip it 180 degrees. I Am Legend is about a virus that gets into the blood of human beings and infects almost everyone in the society. These new beings are portrayed as sick monstrous people. However, when you flip the film and see that the new beings are evolved you get the real purpose of the film. The beings can run faster than humans. They can leap far distances and climb. These beings can communicate without words and had a respect for other living beings.

1602302,4,B00005JPTK,"Emma Thompson has got a lot to answer for, what with her first juking the world with her ""Erm, I say, I may have the cure for cancer"" revelation, except that her vaccine instead transforms most of the world's populace into savage zombie creatures. This makes it a rather monumental oopsie. Anyway, that's it for Emma Thompson, whose early cameo establishes the post-apocalyptic premise. She's never seen again in this film. But she's done enough.

I AM LEGEND is the third film adapting Richard Matheson's classic horror story, although, far as I'm concerned, no one yet's come close to doing justice to the novel. In terms of how it stacks up against the previous two adaptations, I prefer I AM LEGEND over THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston) but not over THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with a fantastic Vincent Price). Will Smith's performance is top notch. Respecting the bleak tone of the movie, Smith stays away from his trademark touches of humor. Instead, Smith delivers one of his strongest performances, plays up his terrific knack for garnering the movie audiences' sympathy. With expressions of despair and horror perpetually etched on his features, Smith humanizes the hell out of his character.

Films like this underscore just how fragile and ephemeral society can be. You topple the infrastructure and break society's contract, and where are we? A palpable sense of desolation, this disquieting thing, shoots thru you as you take in scenes of a deserted New York City. The story picks up there three years after Emma Thompson's cataclysmic bungle. We meet virologist Dr. Robert Neville, the city's (and maybe the world's) last surviving human - as he and his dog Sam tool around the empty, weedy streets in a sports car. In the intervening years - or, as I'm won't to call it, the Post-Emma Thompson Age - Neville has grown strange and a bit mad. Loneliness will do that, and as well that nagging sense that you may be the last left of your kind. Neville, who is immune to the monster-making virus, has never stopped his efforts to unearth a cure, conducting experiments in his basement laboratory. Every day he wakes up and goes about his daily routine. H exercises. He frequents the local video store (in which he'll socialize with mannequins he'd clothed). When the sun reaches its zenith, he waits at the sea port hoping against hope to rendezvous with other survivors. He occasionally hunts for game (wild life, CG-rendered, now dot the cityscape). He's home before dark, barricading his sunlit house with heavy steel shutters. And, after dark, the monsters come out. Maybe the film's most harrowing moment, and the most heartbreaking, is when we glimpse Neville, weapon in hand, and his dog Sam cowering in the bathtub as terrible noises from the outside bombard their ears. The fear is palpable.

Dr. Robert Neville has been in a rut, and it takes two game-changing events to flip the scenario. The first event shatters his spirits. The second one heralds the arrival of a woman named Anna (the gorgeous Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan, both of whom have listened to Neville's recorded daily radio brodasts and decided to take a chance. At this juncture, Will Smith's acting chops come into play again as his character demonstrates the jarring awkwardness and confusion one goes thru when introduced to company after having been alone for so long. Anna and Ethan serve to regalvanize the plot, toss it down a new direction.

The zombies - or Dark Seekers - up the jeopardy by proving to have more game than just skittering around, biting human flesh. One particular zombie exhibits a measure of cunning and, in fact, turns the tables on Neville, and does this in a deliberately ironic way. The one knock against these zombies is that the CG rendering is just a hair off. The film's third act, in fact, is just a hair off as things degenerate into a series of garden variety action sets. Still, for what Will Smith brings to the table and for several impactful scenes which really resonate, I AM LEGEND is worth your time.

In the ""Ain't Nepotism Grand?"" Department, Will Smith's real life daughter, Willow, plays Neville's daughter in all those flashbacks.",1307491200,,4180,4.848739495798319

1602338,3,B00005JPTK,"This film starts out with great promise, with WS as a lone man in a world of chaos.  He is hunting, through the streets of Manhattan, for food and uninfected humans, all the while working on a vaccine for the bio-engineered virus that has more of less destroyed humanity.  WS is convincing as an anguished, intelligent man, who is struggling with his isolation, though his dog is a vital companion.  With flashbacks and preserved video cuts, past history becomes clear:  WS was an army scientist who is the only person to understand the vaccine, which is what makes him immune to the disease of the savages who come out at night.  He has lost his family, understands what has happened to the world and what needs to be done, and has a charismatic strength of character.

So far so good.  You see WS suffer and think as well as act with the decisiveness you would expect from a hero.  There are many excellent details, such as the relationship with his dog or his golfing off the wing of a grounded jet fighter.  It is vivid and beautiful, completely believable.

However, once the night bad guys come to the fore, the film begins to falter.  First, the night baddies are simply not well executed technically:  they don't look real, so you can't believe in them; as one reviewer noted, they look too much like video game characters.  We expect better in computer animation, I'm sorry.  Second, from an introspective survivor film, you get grotesquely violent action.  Not only is the plot unrealistic - the baddies have not discovered him until the night he is rescued by an immune woman and then they come in force - but the action is kind of ridiculous:  the baddies seem invulnerable, though they have lost their human intelligence as they transformed into hairless half-dogs and behave as if they have rabies.  They are seeking human flesh and seem to have some kind of hive mind, like an insect society, but none of the promising threads are developed into plot and theme.  There is not even enough to enable the thoughtful viewer to connect the dots, which is another indispensable component to great scifi.

That being said, I am quite a sucker for these end-of-humanity films.  This one got me to believe, at least for the first half.  It is a mistake to have made it into an action film in the end, though WS is a good action hero.  WS' role is more dramatic than his usual roles, more complex as a character and not at all happygolucky as we expect of the fresh prince.  He is a good actor and did well here, but the script and direction  take it over the top.

1602381,5,B00005JPTK,"""I am Legend"" is a really exciting and scary zombie movie. Technically it is a vampire movie since the zombies can't go out in daylight and in the original novel by Richard Matheson the monsters are supposed to be vampires, but it is otherwise more like a zombie movie.

""I am Legend"" is about a scientist called Robert Neville (played by Will Smith) who survives a plague that turns people into raging bloodsucking vampires. He lives in New York with his dog as his ownly companion. Everyone in New York besides him is a vampire and the city is overrun with wild animals. Since the vampires can't go out in the daylight because their skin gets burned, this allows Robert Neville to travel around the city when the sun is in the sky without fear of danger as long as he stays out of dark buildings. He regularly goes to an abandoned video store to pick out movies to watch at home.

""I am Legend"" has a lot of suspense. When the main character drives around the abandoned city I was really scared that something was going to happen. The main character seems really vulnerable even in the daylight. The movie makes a clever use of mannequins in several scenes that really creeped me out the first time I saw the movie.

The film is well-directed with some great camera work and sound, which saves it, creating a lot of tense moments, suspense, and action.  The CG infected are modestly terrifying, but like Smith's character Robert, pretty hard to buy into, which detract from its value.  Imagine a bunch of taller Gollums from Lord Of The Rings on steroids.  Yet it's a fantasy tale, so suspension of disbelief is necessary and works well enough.

The special effects and digital/CG work are pedestrian at times, but the over-all Direction, acting, story and the camera work really save it, and make it worthwhile.",1289001600,2,878,4.852348993288591

1602405,4,B00005JPTK,"There is a theme that runs through many horror films: the monster is initially welcomed as a wonder, then feared and reviled as its true nature becomes apparent. Attempts to destroy it fail, but an uneasy detente is reached by the end. I Am Legend is a fascinating instantiation of this theme, saved from being a takeoff on 28 Days Later by its deep exploration of loneliness and humanness.

The genetically engineered virus that cured cancer mutated into something that deprived its victims of their skin pigmentation and their ability to control their survival impulses. Those that survive its 90% kill rate turn into dark-seekers, creatures whose skin burns at the touch of light, and whose carnivorous urges compel them to feed on any living animal, including humans. But some intelligence remains; they can set traps, act in coordinated fashion while hunting, train infected dogs to assist them in the kill, catch the eye of a man standing in the sunlight and give a look that says, ""you win this one, but wait until dark."" We are brought to wishing that they didn't have minds any longer, so hideous their existence, but they do have minds, and the thought of being one of those millions who didn't die is worse than death.

Just one percent of the human population is immune to this virus, and one of them is Robert Neville [Will Smith], an Army virologist who finds himself at the epicenter of the outbreak, Long Island. He has no reason to go on. His family was killed trying to evacuate the Island; he broadcasts a call to any other unaffected human and waits every day on the pier at midday for those who hear it to come to him. But no one ever does. But Robert has a will to survive, and that will must be given some purpose, so he constructs a basement lab and continues the search for a cure, accompanied only by his dog, Samantha.

I Am Legend is far from perfect. It is, after all, yet another good-scientist-does-evil-by-unleashing-a-virus-that-creates-cannibalistic-humans flick. But it is also about sanity, the human need to have purpose and companionship, the scientist who finds that he also needs faith.

In 2009 a researcher develops a genetically modified virus that can cure cancer. Unfortunately, the virus undergoes its own mutations and becomes a lethal killer that wipes out 90% of Earth's population. 1% of the population is immune to the virus, and others, though not completely immune, are not killed, but undergo biological changes into light-hating, carnivorous semi-humans.

By 2012 cities are being taken over by wildlife, and the human race is on the brink of extinction. Will Smith is Robert Neville, a US Army Colonel engaged in biomedical research that may produce a cure for the mutated virus. He lives alone in NYC which was ground zero for the mutated viral outbreak.

Smith is free to roam the city by day, but has to barricade himself into his home each night. HIs only companion is his dog. Smith tries trial after trial, and as failure after failure racks up he slowly loses more of his grip on reality.

Among his works made into films are, Somewhere In Time, What Dreams May Come, and Duel, which featured Dennis Weaver pursued by a mad truck driver.  His story I Am Legend, is perhaps his most influential work.  The story is about a nightmare world, where save for one man, the human race have become vampire like creatures.  The first adaptation of Matheson's novel was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B0002HODU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Man on Earth</a>&nbsp;(1964) starring Vincent Price, followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Man-Blu-ray/dp/B001E8AMA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Man [Blu-ray</a>](1971) starring Charlton Heston.  Another remake was the subject of speculation for some time, before finally becoming a reality with Will Smith in the lead role.

(Spoilers ahead, so proceed as you will)

Directed by Francis Laurence, I Am Legend (2007) is set in New York in 2012, where a drug intended to cure cancer has mutated, and instead killed most of mankind.  The survivors have become ""darkseekers"", vicious zombielike creatures, with skin sensitive to UV light.  They dwell in the shadows by day, and run wild at night.  Robert Neville (Smith) a virologist, together with his German Sheppard Sam, have the run of Manhattan, and spends their days performing routine tasks, and hanging out at the South Street Seaport, hoping to find other survivors.  Neville retreats to his home before sunset, to keep his location a secret from the darkseekers.  There in his basement laboratory, he performs research hoping to find a cure for the mutated virus.  How Neville's family is killed in an accident is told in flashbacks, but how things got so out of control, isn't really addressed.

The empty cityscape is in the early stages of decay.  Almost immediately, the atmosphere of emptiness is established, along with the special relationship between Neville and his loyal companion.  They work as a team, sharing a strange life of solitude.  Exploring this relationship, one of the film's best moments comes early on, when Sam runs into a dark abandoned building while chasing a deer, and Neville enters to try and find him.  Here we glimpse the darkseekers for the first time, and witness their brutal strength.

Needing a subject to test a potential cure, Neville utilizes a falling car in a trap that captures a female darkseeker (who appears to have had breast enhancement?).  Observing her capture, a male darkseeker (Dash Mihok) becomes so agitated that he risks death trying to reach Neville.  In several ways, this incident is a pivotal turning point.

Solitude has taken a toll on Neville, affecting his behavior and sanity.  He drives madly through the streets in pursuit of running deer.  At a video store he speaks to mannequins that are setup in the store.  Later, when cruising the streets, he sees a mannequin standing in the street.  He stops his car, and belligerently yells at the dummy, then shoots it up.  He is then literally hoisted on his own petard, when he is caught in a trap, that utilizes a falling car.  This misfortune leads to a soul crushing loss that changes his world, and pushes Neville toward suicidal acts.

The film's third act is very problematic, as it concludes in two radically different ways.  About to become a victim of the darkseekers, Neville is miraculously rescued by a woman named Anna (Alice Braga), who is accompanied by Ethan (Charlie Tahan), a young boy.  They escape in Anna's vehicle, but unfortunately are followed by the darkseekers back to Neville's home.  Anna says she is on her way North to find a group of survivors.

The following night, the darkseekers mount a massive full scale attack.  Neville has some elaborate defense measures in place, but the opposing force is overwhelming.  For being so prepared, Neville strangely has no backdoor escape route out of his home.  In one version Neville sacrifices his life, to provide an opportunity for Anna to escape with a possible cure.  In an alternate version, the captured female darkseeker is returned to her clan, and Neville is spared.  Later Neville, Anna, and Ethan head out of the city, hoping to find other survivors.  Version one is featured on the single disc release, while the second version is included in the two disc and blu ray editions.  Presenting a fatalistic vision devoid of hope, would probably have been box office poison, so it is understandable that the second more optimistic ending was chosen.

The computer generated darkseekers look fake, moving like super powered robots.  There is a social structure with some kind of leadership, however what it may be is not clear.  The leader may the same character, but who can really tell?  Neville's attempt to reason with them when trapped in his lab, is curious.

This updated take has some good points, with the special effects a major contributor to the film's look.  As little time is given to Neville's family life, the darkseekers, or Anna and Ethan, it is his relationship with Sam makes the strongest impression.  When this ends, largely due to Neville's mistakes, it rips a big chunk out of the heart of the film.  Facing death, Neville is literally dragging his ass, when he should be making tracks, wounded or not.  Sadly, it is Sam who pays for his errors.

The void is quickly filled with the introduction of Anna and Ethan, but they are strangers who the audience has nothing invested in.  The battle on the dock is contrived and fake, as is the subsequent way over the top mass attack.  Tack on the dual ending, and you have a third act that derails what was a pretty decent story.  I Am Legend is still worth seeing, preferably in formats with the alternate ending.",1283472000,,5921,5.145549738219895
1602410,2,B00005JPTK,"All in all, I Am Legend is even a disappointment if one went in expecting disappointment. There is no deeper examination of loneliness, just shots of aloneness. The threat to Neville has been dumbed down- in earlier versions he is the threat. In this film, he is the threatened. The female he meets is a religious bubblehead, rather than a plant from the semi-zomboids that are looking to start a New Breed. And on and on goes the watering down. The film fails as both an adaptation, and if seen without knowledge of its forebears. But, aside from its Hollywoodization stripping the tale of its relevance and depth, this film version even fails its low Hollywoodized standards of success- it's dull, poorly made, and has not a second of suspense. It is a retard's retard. But, as I always seek to give credit where it's due, let me state to that grandfather of Hollywood dumbing down, `Thanks for nothing, Mr. Spielberg!'",1283299200,,921,4.726708074534161

1602449,4,B00005JPTK,"""I Am Legend"" is a very enjoyable post apocalyptic ""zombie"" movie that only bears a mild resemblance to the Matheson original story,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765318741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>. Will Smith puts in a good performance in the lead as Dr. Robert Neville, who is perhaps the last ""normal"" human on earth after a highly contagious virus sweeps the US and possibly the world. Being the last man on earth and perhaps the only person who could find a cure for the many infected humans (aka fast zombies) is a huge burden for the good doctor, who has settled into a bit of routine of trying to gather supplies, capture test subjects, and practicing his golf long game.

A lot of the story is told through flashback and there are truly some moving scenes that add to the drama and provide insight to the deteriorating mindset of Dr. Neville. The action is fairly evenly paced, with some heart pounding moments scattered throughout. The special effects range from cheesy to very good, but hold up when needed.

This movie does a great job of setting the mood of the isolation and fear that Dr. Neville experiences and is a quite watchable horror flick... I just think it could have been named something else and would have been just as good.

Recommended!

When I read the book I could see how far the script diverged from the novel. The novel was great and probably one of the first serious additions to the post-apocalyptic genre.

I was all set to hate the new movie but a funny thing happened when I watched it: unlike so many uninspired remakes, this one stood on its own merits. Like ""the Omega Man"", Will Smith's ""I am Legend"" is so different from the book that it's almost unrecognizable.

Frankly- seeing an empty New York was creepy. Seeing all of those familiar, crowded places *empty of people* is enough to put a shiver down your spine.

Watching the world fall apart from a plague that science is helpless against is the mother of all nightmares.

1602480,3,B00005JPTK,"My comments no doubt echo those of other reviewers -- but I contribute in the hope that some filmmakers out there might actually get the message if they see it often enough: CGI just ISN'T scary!!!

In a nutshell -- Will Smith gives a good performance; using real people as zombies would've been a lot scarier than cartoonish CGI zombies.  Hell, even more realistic-looking CGI would not compete with flesh-and-blood flesh-eaters.

Roman Polanski -- for all his news-headline faults -- made a great observation on the commentary track for his film The Ninth Gate (1999): the best use of CGI is when you DON'T notice it.

CGI can be an effective tool -- it worked great in I Am Legend for creating a post-apocalyptic Manhattan.  When you overuse it, however, the result is like overusing any other cinematic tool: usually bad.

Richard Matheson's novel, I Am Legend, is one of my all-time favorites.  I also enjoyed the 1964 (The Last Man on Earth) and 1971 (The Omega Man) film adaptations, for all their faults.  I was so looking forward to this film version as I assumed it would be closer to that great novel.

Neville, he really made you believe that he had been alone for three years. A little lost, a little robotic, a little crazy. Just
about what you would expect of a person who had been through something like that. Very much like Charlton Heston as Neville in the

I thought the concept behind the story was cool.  A scientist claims she has found the cure for cancer, but a few years later, pretty much everyone is either dead or has become some type of creature that lives in the dark and apparently feeds on flesh and blood.  Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist who is living in NYC while trying to find a cure for this disease.  His only companion is his dog Sam.  Their relationship kind of reminds me of Tom Hanks and Wilson from the movie Castaway.  It shows how difficult it is to live in isolation without any other form of human contact.  But as far as the story goes, that's pretty much the gist of it.

They also should have used real actors and actresses to play the creatures.  Sometimes I feel like movies have fallen in love with CGI way too much.  Honestly, the creatures look fake to me.  They just don't look real at all for some reason.  There were also parts of the movie that were just unnecessary (the scene where he goes to ""rent"" movies).  I mean, I understand they're trying to show how he needs contact with other humans, but did we really need to see that scene?  And why did he go back in there after the incident with Sam later on in the movie?  Totally unnecessary in my opinion.

Overall, it was an OK movie.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either.  If you're a Will Smith fan, I'd say go check it out and see what it's about for yourself.",1259625600,,1655,4.311688311688312
1602559,5,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith is simply brilliant as the sole survivor, Robert Neville. Will delivers movingly and convincingly on a script that really focuses on giving us a picture of ""what it would be like"" ... to be the last man on earth, living off the land in NYC. This is the real strength of this movie: there's really not a lot of blood or gore or zombie scenes at all. Yet I was riveted as Robert goes through his ""typical days"" in NYC. Every moment was full of pathos and full of menace, too. And occasionally we got some relief from Smith's trademark humor that blended seamlessly with the rest of his performance to give us ""what it would be like"" with a powerful delivery that just leaves me almost breathless.

There's an effective use of flashbacks that partly tell us the story of how we got to where we're at in this grim New York City; and the flashbacks also serve to give us an overwhelming contrast between Life Before and Life After the apocalyptic disaster wiped out the city. Yet use of flashback was sparing, which I found all the more effective.

Cinematography was excellent throughout, the storyline and script are brilliant, the use of a dog, Samantha, as a key actor was perfect to show us both Robert as companion and Robert as lonely, isolated survivor.

I won't give away the ending, but think it was satisfying as far as it goes, but not nearly as appealing, from my angle, as the foregoing material. That brings up my one complaint: the title. By the end of the movie, we have some sense of the meaning of the title. Yet it still seems to me to feel cheesy and really unworthy of the movie.",1259366400,,1607,4.440677966101695
1602560,4,B00005JPTK,"I haven't read the novel I Am Legend.  And I haven't seen its original big screen outing, Omega Man, starring Charlton Heston.  However, I recently sat down to watch the latest Will Smith-helmed outing of I Am Legend.  The movie is thrilling, touching, and eye-popping.  It's a great evening's entertainment for fans of action and sci-fi thrillers alike.

Smith is the man who is the key to cancer.  The back story tells us that scientists obviously rocked the world when they unlocked this piece of the genetic puzzle.  What they never could have expected was the plague that would claim more lives than cancer ever did.  And that's the backdrop where we get to know Smith's Robert Neville.

Neville is the only human left in New York City.  This is the visually stunning part of the film.  The CGI really gives us an amazing view of a broken down, overgrown, post-apocalyptic New York.  Neville roars through the city hunting deer from his Ford Mustang.  Tearing up sidewalks, and dodging busses, our hero hunts wild deer with his faithful dog Sam.

At night, the two fortify themselves in Neville's apartment.  They must do this because the plague which rocked the world has turned some of its inhabitants into nocturnal monsters.  They are the key threat to our hero's world, and the one compelling reason that keeps him strong.  He was the one who unlocked Pandora's Box.  And no one else will be able to set things right.

Will Smith has come a long way since his Fresh Prince days.  Outings in films like Independence Day, Hitch, Bad Boys, and The Pursuit of Happyness have cemented Smith as a solid leading man.  I Am Legend gives him a chance to really flex his dramatic muscles.  We see Neville as eccentric hermit, grieving husband, and driven hero.

I Am Legend delivers a solid story with echoes that may leave you wondering `what if' for some time after.",1259107200,,1868,4.697530864197531
1602561,2,B00005JPTK,"Let me state right from the beginning that if I had not read the book, I may have ranked the movie higher, but (unfortunately) I can't be that objective. Richard Matheson's near perfect man vs. self story of isolation and terror had been made into too many bad film versions already, and this one does nothing to help the cause. Will Smith does a nice job of trying to carry the film on his well developed shoulders (nice job with the reverse chin-ups, Fresh Prince) but the plot is convoluted and the emotion is forced. Watch this, if you must, but be prepared to be hugely disappointed if you've read and enjoyed the novel.",1257897600,,625,4.491228070175438
1602562,4,B00005JPTK,"Well, I am not a great Fan of Movies which has a story line covering Zombies, any way 'I am Legend' has taken a different approach. This movie is based on novel by Richard Matheson of the same name.

Synopsis : The Movie starts with a flashback where it is revealed that in 2009 a genetically Re-engineered Measles Virus was created to cure Cancer; later on this Virus undergoes mutation and generates a new lethal airborne based disease which spreads worldwide killing ninety percent of those infected, while the remaining few percent who possessed natural immunity to this virus survived rest turned to a aggressive primal beings who were not able to tolerate Sun Light thus forcing them to hide in the dark till dusk. Slowly most of this immune people where hunted by the infected thus making the central character (Will Smith) as the lone survivor of the holocaust.

Will Smith plays as Dr. Robert Neville a US Army Scientist who posses the natural immunity against this airborne disease. He seems to have decided to stay back in Manhattan and try to find a possible cure. His daily day to day routine includes moving across the lonely Manhattan in the day time for hunting and gathering foods while in the night he works in his Lab trying to find a cure. He also waits every day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, where he instructs any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. The only sanity in him is seemed to be kept alive by his only companion 'Samantha' a canine.

Very soon his survival becomes difficult, as his once fortified home at Washington Square becomes an imminent attack spot by a group of the Infected. Within the course of time Smith teams up with a woman named Anna and a small boy named Ethan who save him from a night road assault. The movie ultimately winds up with the cure resulting from his blood and Neville's(Smith)sacrifice to protect it.

Well I think the whole movie pulled up well with the extraordinary performance by Will Smith. The movies first forty minutes has been really a riveting experience, it just gave us a haunting look of the lonely Manhattan.

Though CGI created infected looked a little bit annoying, the overall experience was good. This movie is very much similar to Castaway where Tom Hanks portrays a person marooned in an island. 'I am Legend' may have received mixed reviews from across the world; after all it can be justified as portrayal of person's psychology against all odds and his belief. So in one way the movie has been able to deliver what it had to offer in the first place. If you are looking for lots of action then this movie may not be the right choice; if you are looking for drama with a dark theme then this just proves to do so.

If there is no solid ground which rationalizes for watching this film, then Will Smith's performance is ample enough to give this movie a chance.

I will rate it 7/10

Could have been better...........",1256774400,,2967,4.6273764258555135

It's funny because this action flick is also a tear jerker. You really feel this guys pain and lonliness. The scene were he is begging the manequin to speak was incredible. No this is not some kind of epic action film but it does enough to keep you interested. This movie has a good script,you could probably replace Will with almost anyone and it would be just as good. But then it probably wouldn't make as much money. LOL",1256342400,,600,4.271929824561403
1602574,3,B00005JPTK,"In many respects this is little more than a star vehicle and although Smith gives a strong enough performance as the gun-toting, iron-pumping hero he is never convincing as the desperate scientist trying to save the human race. As the third film version of Richard Matheson's novel this movie strays pretty far from the original material, but that's par for the course with Hollywood adaptations. Some of Neville's personal torment is retained and Smith portrays this well, but apart from this and the basic premise there is little from the book that remains. On the other hand they've shoehorned in a bunch of flashbacks that are clunky and largely superfluous. That said this is entertaining when considered simply as a thrill ride, and the depiction of New York city as an overgrown, derelict ghost town is particularly well realised.",1256083200,,837,5.028776978417266

It's a pity, for if the movie ended on the twist that the book did, it would've made it more powerful. Maybe next time.
As even more reviewers have stated, the first half of the movie builds great promise for a well-done film. Will Smith literally carries the movie with him, and brings the audience along quite nicely. It is an imperial acting job and impressive to watch. The second half, however, devolves into a second-rate zombie movie which taints the overall spectacle. Had the director and writers stuck more closely to the novel's twist, and had they used real actors for the infected population instead of computer animation, we would've had a first-rate, five-star movie to talk about. Like I said, maybe next time.",1255737600,,928,4.80625
1602576,1,B00005JPTK,"Have you all read the book? Once you read it, believe me, you will all vomit after seing the movie. This darn film starts well and almost everybody will have fun watching it. But damn it! Why didn't they stick to the novel for the TWIST? The whole idea behind the title is this incredible twist which is a complete change of point of view! The hero is alone battling vampires. he kills them without any remorse. You think he is justified to do so. At the end, when he is caught. You realize with him that in fact, HE IS the monster. Not them. To the vampires, he is the BOOGEY MAN. He's been killing their vampire kids, wives and husbands for years! To the vampires, HE IS A LEGEND! Now, that's the novel! Plus, in the novel, and the later screenplays that never were used, one of the woman vampire takes a special drug in order to look more human and passes herself off as a wanderer. The hero befriends her and learns to trust her. There is hope for a romance between them. But she will betray him only to have remorse after. She will help him get away.

Now, that's all in the novel. So why haven't they kept that in the film? ARE THEY STUPID OR WHAT? You have all this good material and you cut it to do... to do what? Once you know the novel, it's impossible to not feel sad after seing the film. Impossible. I can't believe the writer, the director and all of the people involved haven't once said: ""Wait a minute. The novel is awesome. Let's stick to that"".

That is what happens when a writer and a director think as themselves as better than the author. They want to make it ""better""...

1602597,3,B00005JPTK,"Rarely do non-franchised Horror Movies get the blockbuster treatment. The onscreen adaptation of Robert Matheson's brilliant novel, I Am Legend, got just that. This is the third time Hollywood has tried to bring the story to the silver screen and the results are pretty good. If you are looking for a faithful recreation of the book, look elsewhere. About the only thing you'll recognize is the character Robert Neville and the fact that he is the last man on Earth. Everything else has been changed or altered.

Will Smith brings an interesting take to the character. Neville is now a military scientist hell-bent on figuring out a cure for a virus that has turned humanity into vampyric zombie creatures. Smith grinds out a gritty performance. As pretty much the only actor on-screen he is enthralling to watch. The man has certainly come a long way since his Fresh Prince days. The movie has excellent pacing and keeps you entertained despite the lack of dialogue. Memory induced flashbacks provide viewers with scraps of pre-apocalyptic back-story. I can't stress just how riveting Smith's Neville is to watch. Viewers will also grow fond of his best friend, Sam...a beautiful German Shepard.

I am Legend's New York is eerie and unsettling. It is perhaps the most realistic post apocalyptic vision portrayed in a film. Seeing the overgrown ruins of New York City is pretty breathtaking. You really get this sense of dread and loneliness. I must give some kudos for the complete lack of music. This was such a brilliant decision. It goes a long way towards making the setting feel empty. The only music is provided by Neville playing the occasional up lifting tune from Bob Marley.

The place where this movie falters big time is with the vampires/creatures. WHY are they all CG!?! You have this surreal, frightening setting for the story to unfold and then you see these laughably bad CG creatures and you hate the movie. Seriously, the effect of these creatures is so jarring to witness that the Genie from Aladdin might as well be trying to scare us.

I Am Legend has the blueprint of a smart and well executed horror thriller. It's such a shame that they went with such horrible CG effects for the vampires. If you can get past that piss poor judgment on the filmmakers behalf, then you will find an enjoyable movie experience. Hollywood still hasn't provided us with a faithful version of Matheson's novel...however this one is still worth checking out.

And this movie, to put it mildly, is a hugely disappointing adaptation.  They went not for a true-to-the-book ending, but a typical feel-good Hollywood conclusion, with none of the author's emotionally shocking impact.  The movie makers of this joke of a film completely missed the point of the climax and conclusion: it's the book's ending that gives the reason for the awesome title.

1602628,4,B00005JPTK,"I AM LEGEND

When Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND came off the press in 1954, he had no idea that his story of the future would see three film incarnations.  In 1964 LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price premiered with its stark black and white images of a war torn European city. 1971's OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston reflected the current society of the late 60's with its violent iconoclasts.

In 2007 Will Smith would bring a different take on the character of a noble scientist in I AM LEGEND.  With his faithful companion, Sam, a devoted German shepherd given to him by his daughter, he patrolled the desolate streets of New York City during the day.

Every day he broadcasted the same message to an apparently silent world.  ""Food, shelter and security"" were more than words to this Dr. Robert Neville.  For him and Sam over 1000 lonely days have passed since the end came. Sometimes, the desire for the past can  lead one to the verge of insanity, especially of the past is clouded by the mists of lost hopes.

Unfortunately, the end did not come for those humans who mutated after exposure to the miracle cure for cancer.  They became a new species who lived together like a hive in the shadows of dead buildings.  They became prowlers roaming the streets at night searching for fresh blood.

The only fault of this film is that the mutants both human and dogs are too super in their abilities.  Unlike the previous two films, the mutants are not really believable, especially the dogs.  It is difficult to have pity for them since every trace of humanity has been ripped from their souls.  However, there is a twist near the end of the film.

Neville's experiments on the mutants were his desperate attempt to find a cure, to bring normalcy back to a barbaric land filled with savages.  Of course, the mutants knew him and Sam all too well.  During the day they were ever watching for him from the dark shadows of their lives.  This day creature and his dog were their mortal enemies.

The story is well written.  Will Smith gives another A+++ performance. James Newton Howard adds another excellent musical score to his impressive library.

This DVD contains an alternate ending on disk two which differs from the first two films.  In many ways, I prefer this ending to the theatre version.

This is what the second disk offers: for there comes a time, when two evolving races must find common ground or face total annihilation.  This ""controversial ending"" gives a hint of hope that true humanity will never die.",1240272000,3,2522,4.626126126126126

I never read the book that inspired this movie, but I am a Will Smith fan and he delivered again in this movie.  I seen the movie in the theater and bought the DVD...so why the 3 star rating?  The problem set I Am Legend presented was very intriguing to me; however, I don't buy into the idea of super human zombie's or any scenario where a person's physiology is suddenly altered.  But...Society is very dependent on infrastructure; in this movie the main character is surviving in an environment not devastated by manmade or natural destruction; what's left I Am Legend is a world that still appears the same but without human presence.  Watching Smith recover and use the resources available and/or left behind, and his way of dealing with isolation from human interaction was appealing.  I would have rated the movie higher if it had invested more time building Smiths character and showing his quest for survival day in and day out.  Instead, it breezed over this aspect leaving holes in the plot...and in the end I was left wanting more.  I have heard that a sequel is in the works and has Will Smith signed on to it; it will supposedly explore what happened leading up to where this movie started.

I can't say the story is anything special, or particularly intelligent. The theme of few people left on the planet, a kind of ""Planet Of The Ape"" type tale, is nothing new. This one just has a few different twists to it and, film-wise, is different in that it features computerized special-effects. As one who normally enjoys those visual treats, I would rate this aspect ""fair,"" too, like the story.

Early on, the animals racing down New York City streets looked very fake. Later, the effects were a little better with the zombies, but nothing that would make you drop your jaw in amazement.

Like the story and FX, Will Smith as the lead character was okay: good, but not Oscar material. Actually, I thought the German Shepherd did the best job of acting in the film!

The first half, I was pleasantly surprised to discover, is very good indeed and doesn't concede to the big guns, explosions and one-liner forumula popularised by the Bruckheimer and Simpson school of Blockbuster movie-making; In keeping with the novel, what you have is the laconic introduction of a man going about an ordered routine in a world in which order has ceased to have meaning.

Because of the ordinariness with which they're treated one doesn't relate to them as an effect.  Smith's performance as Bob Neville is, thank the lord, note perfect. The unspoken dread in his eyes as he's washing his canine companion in the bath-tub and waiting for the sun to set is palpable and, I take my hat off to him, he deserves an Oscar for the strength and subtlety of his performance here. Films like this are carried by their actors and this is a spectacular performance. Not the best of its kind - that accolade still goes to the late, great Bruno Lawrence in the brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quiet-Earth/dp/B000EZ908Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quiet Earth</a>&nbsp;- but certainly in the top five. However, the scene which is the film's greatest triumph is also its greatest tragedy. Namely, when Neville is forced to chase his dog into a darkened building and we're treated to a bravura sequence in which he unequivocally panics as he tracks around darkened corners with his rifle. We, the audience, know that the human infected - whom we still haven't seen - are going to jump out on him. And they do. And when they do, they are unfortunately completely unconvincing as anything other than a special effect - and not a particularly convincing special effect at that - at which that point all of the carefully accrued tension dissipates and the audience finds itself firmly in rubbery Matrix CGI country. Make no mistake about it, if Francis Lawrence had opted for human performers in make-up (of the like seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000TJBN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and Zack Snyder's superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead-Widescreen-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/B0002ABURA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)</a>&nbsp;remake) rather than CGI, it would have probably have been the most terrifying piece of big-budget horror film-making in recent history. In fact, one wonders whether the budget wasn't the deciding factor in making the human infected CGI, as the audiences awareness of them as a special effect drastically reduces the level of horror which would probably have garnered the film an R17/18 rating; something which would have prevented vast swathes of the audience demographic from seeing it and probably would have spelled box office doom given the millions involved. From then on, the film marches steadily on to a denouement which is hurried, rather limp and a complete juxtaposition to the dark themes of the novel. If you're a fan of the novel, you're not going to see it here. The only resemblance to it is the title, the name of the protagonist and, superficially, the situation. Neville is no longer a borderline-alcoholic, blue-collared schmoe barely managing to contain his own self-destructive urges. The scientific examination of the vampire myth that made the book so fascinating is not here. Neither is the final heart-breaking inversion of Neville's plight which so haunted me when I read it as a thirteen year old. Suffice to say, despite three official screen interpretations and numerous unofficial interpretations, the definitive version of this massively influential novel is still to be made. One day, maybe Hollywood will realise that this is one story that doesn't need a rewrite or eye-candy to bolster what is already a supremely haunting and still frighteningly relevant tale.",1235174400,5,5157,6.113103448275862

It all falls apart in the last half hour. The ending of the film (either ending, theatrical or alternate) totally destroys what the real meaning of the title was in the original novel. In the interest of appealing to a mass audience, the writer's completely abandoned the heart and soul of the story and replaced with a paper-thin pseudo-religious feel-good miracle plot device that you would expect from a made-for-TV movie.

I'd like these 100 minutes back, please.

This was not what I'd hoped for. Matheson is a great writer but his premise and art have been sorely butchered here.
The first half is ok, though the exposition is slow and frankly tedious at times. The highlight of this film is the empty scapes of NYC, very nicely done. Buuuut, as soon as the rather boring ""monsters"" show up, it becomes a b-movie horror film, and all of Matheson's concept is subsumed into a different plot line with so many holes they're barely worth mentioning, but glaring nonetheless.

I have to wonder what the cast and crew were thinking as they ""created"" this. Didn't they see what a piece of crap they were making? How can anyone spend a hundred million or whatever this tripe cost and think it was worth it when there is absolutely nothing redeeming or even remotely enjoyable therein?

Truly, you just don't need to watch this movie. See the other cinematic versions of Matheson's fine story, or much better yet, just read the story and get what really matters.

Loud, manipulative dystopian messiness with no redemption or cohesion.

Watching this movie by myself is not suggested for those who get passionately involved in watching movies. I almost walked out because i was so scared something was going to happen that I didn't want to happen, but that just meant that Will Smith's acting was so believable that I sat in my chair riveted and rocking in terror at his performance.

It had it's great moments and I have to say it was Will Smith's acting that really carried this movie. And I haven't seen a movie in a long time that didn't depend so much on CGI characters and special effects. I wish that the beginning of the movie spent more time watching the destruction and dying of mankind. That would have been better to understand and bring more pain to understanding the drive of Robert Nevell and why he was so intent on staying at Ground Zero.

I also wish the producers had invested more into the infected people because I've been more believable ""monsters"" in Lord of The Rings.

Personally, the film could have done with the books sexy lap-dancing vampires gyrating wildly on the front lawn whilst Neville glumly contemplates a box of tissues and a 3-year old copy of ""Readers Wives"".

OK, The Fresh Prince is besieged by his not so fresh subjects (hoho) in a Heston-esque manner by 28 Days Later mega zombies. I prefer the old lurchy ones, you know where you are with those. Anyway, the first half of the film (see Independence Day, War of the Worlds etc etc) is good, we get an insight into the deserted New York and some rather silly fooling about with tailors dummies in scenes probably pinched from The Quiet Earth (Kiwi Low budget sci-fi film.)

There appears to be some sort of mega-king zombie who is intelligent and plans a trap for the incredibly stupid Smith to fall into, but we are never told the motivation for this. Why did the zombie do it? All of these shenanigans fall by the wayside quicker than a sunbathing vampire when the love interest arrives. The wheels fall off the film, which lurches to a less dignified end than an old fashioned zombie with no underpants on.  Which is a shame because this film could have been pretty good.

1602710,3,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is another action flick release by Will Smith.  This time Mr. Smith stars as Robert Neville, a US military scientist who helped create a virus-based vaccine against cancer that ends up becoming contagious, spreading to the entire human population, killing of 90% of humans, and turning most of the survivors into cannibalistic, light-hating creatures; i.e. vampire - zombies called Darkseekers.  Most of the movie takes place in New York City, specifically in Neville's town home, and in the streets and buildings of Manhattan.

The drawbacks of the movie are primarily in the plot; specifically there are some very dumb scenes.  Probably the biggest is the lack of firepower wielded by Dr. Neville.  We learn in the movie that Dr. Neville happens to be an Army officer.  We also see that Dr. Neville has been living alone in NYC for several years, often fighting of Darkseekers.  Dr. Neville also has a lot of time every single day to drive thru the city, stop of at music and DVD stores to ""rent"" movies and CD's, arrange various store mannequins to provide him ""company"", play golf, and chase animals that have escaped from the local zoos.  Yet in the entire movie, Dr. Neville has only three guns on him, an automatic rifle, and two handguns.  For someone living in a city full of zombies that want to eat him, who has military training, and who has a lot of time to acquire firearms in a city that must be full of gun shops, I would think Dr. Neville would be loaded with guns.  In the final scene when the Darkseekers storm his house, he uses a grand total of 1 gun with 1 clip, and 1 grenade.  This is preposterous.  I would have hundreds of firearms in that house, several per room, with lots of ammunition clips around.

A second stupid scene in the movie is when Dr. Nevill falls into the Darkseekers' trap and gets strung up by his leg.  For a sober Army officer to fall into such a simple trap is ludicrous and mind-boggling.

Probably the dumbest part of the movie is why doesn't Dr. Neville start demolishing the hiding places of the Darkseekers.  He clearly knows how to construct and use explosives, as shown in the movie's climax.  And he clearly has the time to do this, so why does he not start blowing up various dark spots throughout the city as a way of clearing out the Darkseekers?

So all in all, this is a movie with a great premise and good acting, but some big plot holes that lead to very stupid scenes.",1229990400,3,2444,4.528473804100228

1. Smith's character is a military man who can bobby-trap an entire city block, but is unable to spot (and avoid) a simplistic guerilla trap. (Note to the colonel: ""Who do you THINK moved Frank the dummy? The deer?!?)

2. He's been alone for 3 years and convinced that he's the last person on earth. A beautiful woman comes and literally saves him from death ... and he can barely have a civil conversation with her?

3. How did the baddies get into his house at the end? It seemed like Smith's character left a window open in his daughter's room. Again, after locking down the house for 3 years (and it being a matter of life/death), he's gonna forget to close a window?

4. Smith's character has the ability to design and construct heavy steel shutters over his house windows, and then builds a laboratory door out of .... what? It looked like cardboard the way those baddies blasted through it.

I'm willing to suspend some disbelief when I watch movies, but the ending of this movie had too many holes in it. Even fictional worlds need to have some degree of coherency.",1229904000,2,1758,4.471875

1602735,4,B00005JPTK,"Richard Matheson's novel ""I Am Legend"" has been made into at least three motion pictures -- ""The Last Man on Earth"" (Vincent Price), ""The Omega Man"" (Charlton Heston), and ""I Am Legend"" (Will Smith) -- and has served as inspiration for dozens of others.  The story combines science fiction and horror in a bleak, pessimistic view of the future of mankind.

In the latest version, ""I Am Legend,"" Smith stars as Robert Neville, a scientist who was unable to halt the spread of an incurable, man-made virus.  Immune to the fatal virus, Neville is the sole human survivor in what remains of New York City and possibly the world.  His only companion is his dog, Samantha.  But mutant plague victims -- the Infected -- lurk in the darkness, watching Neville's every move and waiting for him to make a fatal mistake.  Day to day, Neville is driven by a single mission:  to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus.  To do so, he must use his own immune blood.

""I Am Legend"" is by far the most ambitious of the three screen adaptations of Matheson's novel.  The opening scenes, showing a deserted Times Square overgrown with vegetation, are spectacular, and Smith manages to keep the story flowing in the early scenes even though he's the only person we see.  Flashbacks illustrate the stages leading up to the present near-obliteration of humanity and are elaborately staged by director Francis Lawrence.  The film's third act resorts to a fairly routine formula of the hero versus the monsters but, overall, ""I Am Legend"" is an impressive effort.

The ""I Am Legend Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is just the thing for sci-fi and Will Smith fans.  The three-disc box set contains two versions of the movie, one with a controversial ending; a digital copy of the film; four animated comics; 12 never-before-seen deleted scenes along with filmmaker's commentary; a 44-page concept sketch book; a lucite commemorative piece featuring images from the movie; and hours of featurettes covering filming on the aircraft carrier Intrepid, canine training, making New York City look deserted, assistance provided by the U.S. Military, and the integration of CGI images with live action footage.",1229817600,12,2183,4.945205479452055

There's vicious rats that I'll probably have nightmares about tonight and omigod, the monsters are for reals, very scary. Um, did I mention the freakin' car? Any gearhead worth her spit will get off on the 2007 Shelby Mustang GT500 as it literally destroys the streets of Manhattan, even if it is CGI. It's still a dream come true. Good story telling, escapism, and, in my opinion, the best actor of my generation, Will Smith. And definatly the best car. The dishes will have to wait.",1229644800,,745,4.445255474452555

1602738,2,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend (2007) Will Smith stars in this third movie version of Richard Matheson's classic 1954 science fiction novel. Will plays Robert Neville, here an Army colonel/scientific researcher stuck in a world decimated by a virus that was created to cure cancer. Although he is the last man on earth, he is not alone in the world. He spends his days working on a cure for the virus, and his nights locked away in a secret fortress, hiding from what mankind has become: crazed vampiric creatures with little resemblance to their former human existences. Neville's only companion is his faithful dog Sam. Three years after the outbreak they live in New York City, with plant life and herds of wild deer beginning to encroach on what was once man's domain. Based on Men in Black and Independence Day, Will Smith + Science Fiction = Big Budget Entertainment with Lots of Effects and Hilarious Wisecracks. This time, an actor wanting to stretch himself and a more downbeat story means no wisecracks. As a result, this is an impressively mounted movie with a very good central performance, but the lack of interaction and rather dour proceedings keep this one from scoring a bullseye. The two previous versions of the story (including The Last Man on Earth (1964) with Vincent Price and The Omega Man (1971) with Charlton Heston) have their moments and are worth a watch for those so inclined, with Last Man scoring highest as an adaptation of the novel since it sticks closest to it. It is mainly hampered by a budget too small for its ambitions and being made in English by Italians. The Omega Man is fun in the way only science fiction action movies from this period starring Charlton Heston can be. This third version has all the CGI visuals money can buy but changes Matheson's story a lot (too much?) and has a tacked on ""moviemaking-by-committee"" finale that doesn't work very well. The film's original ending wouldn't have been much better, still differing from the novel's a lot. A combination of the two would have been the best bet but until Hollywood decides to release a series of ""Craig Edwards Cut"" DVD's you'll have to ask me what that would have been. So, in the end, this is worth a look for Will Smith fans, as long as they don't expect many laughs or lighter moments but instead a bleaker movie experience.",1229472000,,2320,4.702702702702703
1602739,2,B00005JPTK,"Maybe it is the last third that blows it. What went wrong? This could have been good sci-fi. What a pity. We've had a lot of vampire and zombie movies over the years and many post-apocalyptic movies. I like 'em even if they aren't done that well, as does apparently a large swath of the public. So, I say the first half or so is excellent. Seeing a realistic depiction of a large city devoid of human beings, crumbling bit by bit, nature all around reclaiming ground, is interesting. New York City is the most cinematic location to digitally degrade with cutting edge computer effects with it's famous monuments and streets and gigantic skyskrappers and celebrated bridges. I've found Will Smith to not always be the most interesting actor but his performance works. Basically Smith is a military scientist in responsible for finding a cure for a super-virus similar to the disease in 28 WEEKS LATTER which turns people into fleshing eating crazed turbo-vombies. Luckily for Smith the ghouls in this flick are like vampires destroyed by sunlight. This allows him free reign over almost all of Manhattan during the day, except of course the insides of darkened buildings where monsters shelter themselves from deadly ultraviolet light. Meeting the monsters is the highlight of the movie for me. I was nervous. As for these transformed mutants of the night, they sound scary and look deformed by disease but fake. For the longest time I've said use make-up and masks when you can and cost effective computer effects for the extras--for the background zombies or zombies in dark environments when detail is less an issue. Up close in the light you got video game level quality and that is very lame. Things started to go downhill for me with a strange trap Smith gets caught in that I simply didn't buy and never found a good explaination for. After this his character is disapointing when confronted with a painful loss. Then we discover he is a man without faith in god which is a bad thing?? Not sure where they were going with that and if we're supposed to believe he got it back I simply missed that part--not that I cared in the first place. Without spoiling anything, the final nail on the coffin is the absurd conclusion to Smith's story. The timing of it! Yeah okay. And speaking of timing, got to love the scene on the wharf. Just in the nick of time, outta nowhere...What are those odds? In the end the movie wraps up and your just left with an uninteresting conventional movie.",1229385600,2,2486,4.704128440366972

1602746,4,B00005JPTK,"When it comes to remakes of films I've always liked, I generally have very low expectations. This one, of course, is a remake of _The Omega Man_ (the only good film Charlton Heston ever made, in my opinion), which was based on the novel by Richard Matheson -- also one of my favorites. (The version meant to star Schwarzenegger fell through before completion.) And there was a terrible version starring Vincent Price called _The Last Man on Earth._ Also, Will Smith, who is actually a pretty good actor, had already appeared in _I, Robot,_ one of the worst films ever based on a classic science fiction story. So, would this attempt be any better?

I'm pleased to say that, while this version of one of the best ""zombie"" yarns ever written has significant differences from both the book and the Heston movie, it's a very good piece of work taken on its own. Smith is Robert Neville, an army researcher involved in developing the genetically mutated virus that brings an end to cancer as it spreads. Unfortunately, it mutates farther than intended and kills off ninety percent of the world's population. Of the survivors, another few percent become inhuman ""Dark Seekers"" and kill off all the others. Neville is one of only a handful of naturally immune individuals. And while cooped up in his house on Washington Square, trying desperately to find a cure for the plague he helped cause, he's going slowly and quietly insane. And when night comes, the windows are shuttered and the doors bolted because the Infected will be coming out to hunt. Smith plays the role with considerable power and believability. The camera work and the sets are excellent, and the screenplay is first-rate. One of the best horror films I've seen in awhile.",1228780800,,1734,4.79933110367893
1602747,1,B00005JPTK,"Hollywood has never had much luck adapting science fiction author Richard Matheson's cult 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"" successfully to the screen. Iconic horror movie star Vincent Price headlined the first version; the Italian-lensed ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) ranked as an austere, but depressing widescreen, black & white epic with vampire/zombies as his antagonists. Call them zompires! Price impersonated a valiant scientist, Robert Morgan, with an acquired immunity to a deadly virus that had devastated mankind. Morgan struggled desperately not only to survive acute loneliness but also to cure the survivors. Full-frame copies of this opus are available everywhere in DVD bargain box sets. Not-surprisingly, Price perished in the end.

Charlton Heston retooled the role in the 1971 remake, ""The Omega Man,"" released by Warner Brothers. Heston turned immunologist Robert Neville into a brawny, bare-chested, romantic, action stud hero who cavorted in a blue flight suit with a dress uniform cap complete with scrambled eggs on the visor. Watch ""The Omega Man"" and see if Neville doesn't resemble a Marvel Comics character. Naturally, Heston brought the messianic allure that he had gained from ""The 10 Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur"" to the role. Along the way, Heston's Neville indulged in one of the first interracial big-screen romances with African-American actress Rosalind Cash. An army of heavily robed, non-vampiric mutants led by Matthias (Anthony Zerbe) triumphed over him, and he died tragically as a misunderstood Christ figure.

Will Smith fares even worse in the third and least well-done version, ""I Am Legend"" which finally uses the original title of Matheson's novel. Essentially, Smith imitates the Heston hero as a weapons reliant action hero/virologist. They differ in how they contend with loneliness. Heston played chess with a bust of Julius Caesar and fed images of himself via a surveillance camera onto a big-screen television. Smith's Neville dresses up mannequins at a local video rental store and converses with them when he selects a movie. Unlike both Price and Heston, Smith doesn't enjoy a post-apocalyptic romance. Instead of female companionship, Smith has to settle for a German shepherd; canine lovers are warned ahead of time to expect the worst. Even when a woman, Anna (Alice Braga of ""City of God""), does show up near the end, our hero doesn't take the time to sweep her off her feet.

Generally, the problem with all three movies is that the star has to bear the movie on his shoulders for the brunt of the action. Remember that hideous Tom Hanks' movie ""Castaway?"" Half of ""I Am Legend"" looks like ""Castaway"" with Will Smith performing monologues devoid of humor. Sadly, despite a strong performance, Smith has to deal with adversaries that neither Price nor Heston contended with--namely, colorless, chrome-domed, computer-generated cannibals. ""I Am Legend"" forfeits any semblance of dramatic impact, much as ""I, Robot"" did, with its cartoon-like CGI villains. Smith wages an eternal war against video game antagonists who cannot speak, making them dim-witted, lowest-common-denominator dolts.

""I Am Legend"" opens on an ironic note. Scientists have discovered a cure for cancer. Things go incredibly amiss, however, and Dr. Krippen (an unbilled Emma Thompson of ""Sense and Sensibility"") winds up unleashing a man-made virus in the year 2009 that transforms humanity into homicidal mutants that plunder and destroy everything in sight. Incidentally, these mutants don't appear until midway in the movie after scenarists Mark Protosevich of ""Poseidon"" and Akiva Goldman of ""Batman & Robin"" have established Smith's character and his predicament. The filmmakers rely on occasional flashbacks to fracture that storyline and show how Smith became the last man on Earth. We learn that his wife (Salli Richardson of TV's ""Eureka"") and daughter (Smith's real-life daughter Willow) died in a helicopter collision around the same time that the military quarantined Manhattan Island and sealed off access to it. The military destroy the two landmark Big Apple bridges, but Neville (Will Smith) vows to remain at ground zero and devise a cure.

Three years later, in 2012, Neville and his dog venture outside by day to search for non-infected survivors as well as to forage for food and lock themselves up at night. In an early scene, Neville hunts for fresh meat by pursuing escaped zoo animals through the cluttered, weed-choked canyons of Manhattan in a red Ford Mustang with a high powered rifle. He watches old television shows that he has recorded before the apocalypse while he eats. The mutants themselves are not very interesting. In ""Last Man on Earth,"" the mutants were vampire/zombies that besieged the hero's house at night. In ""The Omega Man,"" the villains were the equivalent of albino Klansmen that terrorized the streets after dark and clashed constantly with Neville.

Like the previous versions, ""I Am Legend"" delivers a dour, downbeat ending that will bum you out beyond belief. The special effects are shoddy and superficial; the villains emerge as a mob of one-dimensional, head-banging morons, and the hero degenerates into an ignoble, unsympathetic, atheistic lout. There is nothing exciting or suspenseful about our hero's late-night encounter with the mutants on the docks where he uses his SUV as a weapon to smash them. Even more implausible is the way that he gets out of this cliffhanger confrontation. ""Constantine"" director Francis Lawrence provides several startling, gotcha-by-the-gullet, scare scenes that will frighten the squeamish, but seasoned gorehounds won't find anything different or dazzling about this drivel.

Will Smith's track record with science fiction is faltering badly these days. ""I Am Legend"" is nowhere near as memorable or entertaining as either ""Independence Day"" or his ""Men in Black"" movies. Instead, ""I Am Legend"" is legendarily lame!",1228608000,8,5930,5.356223175965665

And the approaches to the theory behind the approach that the writers took, with the research into the development of mutations of viruses made it the more believable.

It's easily the worst adaptation of the I AM LEGEND story. Last Man On Earth is the best one and even Omega Man is more fun to watch. If you're going to go collector's on this, why not tie into it the short brilliant story by Matheson...perhaps print a small version of the story as a booklet, detail the parts where the writers took from the novel, where they strayed off. Include Last Man on Earth and Omega Man as discs into the set...make it a collector's tribute to the I Am Legend story. This movie alone is just an 'ok' sci-fi flick...nothing profound or cultish about it. And in this era of great special effects, the creatures were no better than video game quality (and even sub par from that at times).

Vulnerabilities to religious icons were merely psychological holdovers from victims of a disease who believed they were vampires.  But the thirst for blood was very real. It established the post-apocalyptic fear of contamination.

Since I Am Legend is a Will Smith vehicle, I figured it'd have some wisecracks, a lot of action, and Smith saving the day.  So I was surprised to get exactly that - but not delivered in the way I expected.

I Am Legend is very much like a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Boy-His-Dog/dp/B0000C825J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Boy & His Dog</a>&nbsp;in that our two protagonists are Robert Neville (Will Smith), a virologist responsible for finding a cure in New York City, and his dog Samantha, wandering a world gone mad. What's interesting about I Am Legend is the question posed by the title.  Why is Neville a legend?

The most obvious answer is that Neville is immune to the disease that has converted 90 percent of humanity.  As such, he believes he holds the cure within himself.  In that regard, if Neville can succeed in stopping the plague, he will be a legend to all of humankind.  But there's more to I Am Legend than that.

It's fitting that his companion is a dog.  With only Sam as his companion, Neville is truly a legend; the only other living being idolizes Neville, just as dogs idolize their masters.  Neville also creates a fictional community of people out of mannequins in a DVD rental store, where everybody knows his name.  Neville is indeed a legend in his own mind.

There's also the possibility, posited in the original story, that Neville isn't famous as a savior, but infamous amongst the new breed of humanity as a mass murderer.  In that regard Neville is legendary not because of whom he saves but whom he kills.  Neville sacrifices countless of the infected in a quest for a cure, and in the process loses a little bit of his own humanity.

I Am Legend could easily have been an egotistical macho romp in a world gone mad in the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Max/dp/B00005R2IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Max</a>.  Instead, it is a thoughtful meditation on how communities define ourselves, even if your only friend is a dog.  Although the director flinches at the uncompromising ending that could have been (and is on the two-disc special edition), I Am Legend is a serious entry in both science fiction movies and Will Smith's string of blockbusters.",1228003200,2,2724,5.502403846153846

1602776,4,B00005JPTK,"In ""I Am Legend"" the apocalypse has hit the world, a man-made virus intended for good, intended to cure cancer, but gone horribly awry.  On a planet now populated by hordes of mutated, vampire-like victims of the plague, a surviving military scientist (Will Smith, in his best performance), somehow immune to the disease, works in a fortified house to find a cure, walking the city with his canine companion in search of specimens to test various experimental treatments on, and in search for survivors.

  He's set up a radio transmitter that sends out messages on all frequencies urging any other survivors to meet him at a certain time and place to band together, but day after day, year after year, he finds no one there to meet him.  Interspersed with the post-apocalyptic time frame we see frequent flashbacks showing the early days when the 'cure' was going wrong, and global panic was breaking out.  The plague victims are nightmarish creatures, shirking from the sun, ravenous, violent and mindless.  During the nights the doctor barricades himself and his companion inside the house, but the ghastly creatures are out there, always.  It's a bleak world being presented, but done well.  I've noted before that 'bleak' is among the hardest moods to do right in a movie, but I Am Legend does it brilliantly.  Part of it is that the grim mood is punctuated by touches of the idyllic: the abandoned city beginning to look alive again as all this beautiful greenery creeps in, deer bounding about...but there's nothing idyllic or peaceful once you get into the shadows where the creatures dwell.  One of the creatures, in particular, is especially disturbing: he seems much smarter than the others, seems angrier than the others, and the others are starting to follow his lead.

  **WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD***

  Eventually, Smith's character does come across another survivor, two actually: a woman and her little boy.  Instead of just relief, tension soon follows.  Smith has by this point become utterly defeated psychologically and spiritually - he no longer believes there's any hope of his finding a way of reversing the mutation, he's lost faith in just about everything, and he reacts with disbelief and almost anger as she claims God guided her to him, and her claims that an entire colony of survivors is out there waiting for them.

  Where the movie goes from here I'll refrain from hinting at, but it continues developing.  A lot of what happens in the latter parts are highly interpretative, and fascinating.  The movie does miss a couple of opportunities, and is a bit slow in places, but those minor hindrances are blown away by the overall power of the movie.  Emotional, at times frightening, at times spiritual, boasting great cinematography and great performances from a cast that has some very demanding material, I Am Legend is among the top movies of 2007.  9/10",1226275200,,2903,4.958592132505176

1602779,4,B00005JPTK,"When it came out there was a great advertising and promotion campaign. Yet it did not fulfill its promises. One more survival film, you will say. Maybe but I am afraid it is more serious than that. One more epidemic film. Yes for sure, but yet it is deeper than that. One more zombie and living dead film then. Absolutely, but the disappointment comes from farther than that. The film uses three very common forms and it could have intertwined them and twisted them in a new creative way. But with one character and a dog, you do not go that far. In fact it is the whole argument of Stephen King's The Stand. The super flu, the dying of everyone, the survival of a few. But Stephen King remains human and the two antagonistic camps are human survivors and then they represent the two opposite impulses of the human species: to fight and kill to survive against others, and to organize collectively to survive with others. In this film the survivors are good humans and all the others are bad mutants. Badness in man is thus not human but antihuman. That is very nave indeed, especially when we understand the epidemic was caused by the irresponsible experiments of one doctor on thousands of people with genetically manipulated viruses. It is this vision of good humans attacked from outside by some who are no longer human at all that makes the film poor and even weak. Evil is not outside. Evil is inside. Anyone who says the reverse is just a blind man. Then the plot is no plot because we know what it is going to be. There is no surprise and no psychological death. And the dramatic events here and there are defused by too much disbelief to suspend. How did the woman arrive in Manhattan, how did she escape the house, how did she drive out of Manhattan, how did she know where to go? And many other questions like those. Then the legend becomes a fable and a weak one at that. Too bad because the theme could have been better and the author behind, Matheson, is supposed to be better than that.

Agreed with most reviews which state that the 1st hour was good but then it gradually deteriorates.

So here's my list of problems with the plot:

How a cure for cancer became an airborne virus is not explained.

Why is Neville immune? He must know because he is making the anti-virus.

The zombie/vampire creatures are made out to be exceptionally stupid, but for stupid creatures they show some great signs of intelligence towards the end. Like:
laying a trap for Neville, which he falls for and ends up hanging from a rope.
climbing a lamppost in order to flatten his car.

Samatha's death - why did he not inject Sam with the cure that he knew worked on a rat, and ultimately worked on humans?

The woman and her son - they just appear out of nowhere with little explanation of how they survived the chaos. They bring a message to the movie that I have not seen revealed .. which is 'Human's screwed up and nearly wiped out their species, but god is finding a way to help the human race survive. She is a messenger from god, how else could she have found a human colony in Vermont?

Finally, the colony walls - what's the stop the creatures from scaling them?

Will gives a moving performance that stays with you. It's on the basis of memorable story and images that Legend is far more resonant than most movies I've ever seen.

Will Smith earned his paycheck here more convincingly as a soldier than as a scientist, but on the other hand the mutants he battled were one of the neater CGI foes to come along in a monk's age. I Am Legend hasn't lingered in my mind the way a truly good movie will but I recall being pleased enough when I first saw its story of one man and his loyal dog surviving in a disquietingly vacant post-epidemic Manhattan. So, your call here. If you like Will Smith movies, grim futures, recumbent humanity and cannibalistic mutants-cum-monsters, you'll probably enjoy I Am Legend.

He broadcasts daily on AM radio asking for people to meet up with him at what looks to be an old naval base by the water.  Neville and his German Shepherd Sam show up everyday looking for other survivors of the virus, named KV.  Once thought to be the cure for cancer, the engineered virus mutated and spread airborne, killing people and radically altering those who didn't die into zombie-like, mindless beings.

Neville spends his days hunting deer, loose from the park or the zoo, and picking up supplies for his house.  His nights are spent inside his altered house, shuttered and barricaded against the beasts of the night.  Beneath the house is his lab, where he continues to work diligently on a cure for those infected monsters that prowl the streets at night, hungry for blood.  He sets traps to catch the zombies for test subjects using his serums.  At last, Neville believes he's found a serum that will work.

During an excursion in town, Neville notices one of his store mannequins has been moved, and when he investigates he's caught in a trap and unconscious until nightfall.  Who moved the mannequin and who set the trap?  Is someone else still alive and uninfected?  Neville and Sam must make it back to the car before sundown, but the hour is late and the darkness is falling.  Something bad is about to happen.

To those of you who've read the classic 1954 novella, 'I Am Legend', by Richard Matheson, the movie does not follow the book very well.  Other movies have been made from the novella, including the 1964 movie 'The Last Man On Earth' and 'The Omega Man' filmed in 1971 starring Charlton Heston. In this version, the infected are more like zombies than vampires, and more aggressive.  The film had been modernized (the incidents in the book take place in 1976) which is more attractive to today's audiences, and there's a lot more action involved.  The movie is more external (action) which is well suited for a film version than the book, which is more internal (introspective), but what I really didn't like was how they twisted the ideal of Neville's ""legend"" status.

Will Smith does an excellent performance as Neville, and the atmosphere of a deserted New York City was captured quite nicely.  The zombies are pretty cool, though I don't know who dreamed up the hairless idea.  Sam the dog is added to the film (not in the book) but Sam stole the show for me.  (I love German Shepherds!)  If you're a Matheson fan and have enjoyed both novella and the other remakes of this story, then 'I Am Legend' is well worth the purchase.  Enjoy!",1223942400,2,2649,4.6373390557939915

I am Legend stars Will Smith as a scientist who has survived a deadly virus that was developed by genetic engineering to kill cancer; instead it has killed off most of mankind.  Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.  There's a ton of science fiction books that could be made into good movies.

1602798,4,B00005JPTK,"I absolutely loved this film.  I must admit i did not expect much going into it.  I have never been a huge Will Smith fan or a fan of science fiction which this film seemed to be.  Wow, was I shocked and amazed with the excellent, quality film of the highest caliber that totally took me by surprise.

This film is so well made.  I thought the story was very well laid out.  The government thought that they had finally found a cure for cancer by using a vaccine for another illness.  After much use the treatment backfired with major side effects with the people turning into flesh eating zombies who could never be in the sun.  I didn't look at the creatures as mere vampire like beings but thought the deterioration due to the vaccine was well documented.  Back to the plot, New York City becomes quaurantined and Will Smith plays Neville, a military scientist who stays in New York to work on finding a cure.

The barren and stranded New York City is amazing to view.  I was caught up in the film from the first second and amazed as I watched the small world Neville had created for himself and his dog which allowed him to work on the cure but also have protection from the creatures.  He ventured out every day and returned at night.  Will Smith has been praised for other films but his work here was truly Oscar worthy.  The first half of the film is the best when it is just him and the dog.  His characterization is more than believable as the lone survivor who deals with loneliness by talking to mannequins etc.  He has not gone crazy but has adapted.  I found the story to also be believable and the creatures when shown were also believable and very well created.  The movie has a serious basis but also has chills and thrills like one of the best horror films there are.

In the latter half of the film the plot changes a little (I won't give it away) and the 5 star plus caliber of the first half gets a little off track.  It is still excellent but the first half was so superior it is hard to compete with.  The film has a purpose and shows Will Smith as never seen before.  Whatever your expectations for this film, upon viewing they will be far surpassed.  Excellent acting, amazing production and directing.

Highly recommended.",1223424000,,2247,4.38498789346247

1602800,2,B00005JPTK,"This story had so many horrible plot holes that by the end I was glad it was over.  Will Smith doesn't sacrifice himself to save the world; he just wants out of the lousy story he's become a part of.

The opening scene is a ridiculous, pathetic masturbatory commercial for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ford-Mustang-GT500/dp/B0014CGBDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ford Mustang GT500</a>.  I mean, really, who would hunt deer from a speeding sports car, even if you actually could?  This opening had me shaking my head in disappointment, and the rest of the movie didn't take that feeling away.

The CGI was lame, shallow and low-budge throughout.  Almost all of the viral-zombies (VZs) were CGI, and were not convincing.

All the VZs did was run really fast, climb like vampire-monkeys, and of course open their mouths really wide and roar a lot.  Man, we've seen this dumbass mouthy-roaring gimmick a million times since it became the de rigueur monster stunt in the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mummy/dp/B000ASATYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mummy</a>&nbsp;movie.  Now it's just trite and predictable, and no longer effective.

So, Will Smith is an Army LTC doctor, with a massive townhouse right on Washington Square in the heart of Manhattan, with a completely outfitted viral research suite in the basement?  And he has all of the trappings of the pre-Armageddon life because he's resourceful n' stuff n' all?  Yeah, puh-leeze.

And he powers all this stuff in his house and the lab with three or four Honda--nice product placement!--generators, which we see running happily . . . in the flipping pantry!  Hollywood, there is this odorless, colorless gas, called carbon monoxide, which is emitted in the process of combustion, which . . . aw, the hell with it.

In an abandoned city, the first electrical short or lightning strike will start a fire, which with everyone including the fire department dead, will burn out of control.  If there was such a struggle at the end of humanity, wouldn't there be a battle or two, maybe a little fire here and there?  In a city as dense as NYC, all of Manhattan would burn for weeks.  Nope, none of that, no evidence of it.  Just rusty cars and some grass in the cracks of the pavement.

In a tense scene early on, we see the VZs for the first time in a very dark room strewn with bundles of money, a bank vault--on a second floor.  I mean, seriously, who puts a massive bank vault on the second floor?  Who reviews these settings and agrees to shoot them?

If the VZs come out at night and are so flipping voracious, why are there so many deer running all over the island?  If animals can be infected, too, why are there so many deer running all over the island?

If the VZs are so screamingly (literally) violent, why haven't they all killed and eaten each other yet?

Our hero, the brilliant doctor, makes the crucial observation of the VZs that they have lost all semblance of human behavior, yet the VZ ""leader"" steals a mannequin from one of the hero's haunts, moves it to a crucial location, and sets a clever trap, clearly learned from watching the hero do the same thing earlier.  And then the VZ leader-guy sics three apparently trained--these are supposed to be completely unhinged, ultra-violent critters, right?--viral-zombie dogs on our hero.  I mean, if the VZs were this smart, why aren't they driving cars and carrying weapons themselves?

Our hero has weapons stashed everywhere, and knows how to put them into action, too.  Until, that is, when it's time for things to go south and the finale to come.  Then he just can't hit a thing, even on full auto.  Junk.

At the end, the VZ leader-guy breaks his way slowly through the unbreakable lab glass by smashing his head and body into it repeatedly, with no signs whatsoever of any kind of physical trauma.  But, uh, we've seen throughout the movie that although highly infected, and completely psycho, these VZ guys after all are physical beings which are more or less human in frame, strength and stamina, injured and killed with violence which would do the same to a human, even brought down by one or more shots from a firearm.  But when the Big Dramatic Finish comes, it's time for the VZ bad-guy leader to suddenly become so much more, an ber-zombie, if you will.  Barf.

Manhattan is an island, right?  How did the heroine-lady get onto it with her son?  And how did she get off?

I will say this: Will Smith does do some pretty heavy acting in a couple of scenes, especially early on.  I'll give the man that much, with no reservations.  His environments may be CGI, but his acting is real, solid and powerful.  That German Shepherd was doing some pretty heavy ""acting,"" too--that was one really well-trained canine.

Bottom line: I'm amazed this didn't get to DVD faster, given the shockingly inept story.  But the story Will Smith is working with is junk.  Don't pay to rent this.  Wait for it on video, or see it on a buddy's dime; then it will be worth your time.",1222387200,4,5087,4.875291375291376

There were ultimately some scenes that I could have lived without, some scenes that made me cry, and some scenes that I thought were very cute.  It was interesting how a movie could combine so many different genres into one, and still maintain a simple plot line.

Today I saw the alternate ending which is suppposed to be the original ending where there is a reconciliation (the woman with the butterfly tattoo is the male vampire's companion) as she regains humanity as a result of Neville's work.

 This is a happy ending that reminds me of Blade Runner's original ending where Deckard and the perfect replicant, Rachel, escape.(Did I dream that part?) Did anybody notice the peace crane left by Gaff? Not everything has to end on a final note of death.

In ""The Twelve Monkeys"" and ""28 Days Later"" we also have the unleashing of a deadly virus caused by medical science. As in the 1950's with our fears of atomic bombs being unleashed everywhere and altering genetic structure, ""Them"" with James Arness, and ""Godzilla,"" we seem to have become enamoured (if that word can be used) by our fascination with vampires and biological warfare doing us in.

The film does a good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware that messing around with viruses and genetic engineering will sooner or later lead to a mistake that mankind will regret. It is inevitable.

1602849,1,B00005JPTK,I was very disappointed in this movie and I was surprised that Will Smith aggreed to star in it.  It lacked credibility and it was not worth the money put into it.

Very lucky the last man standing is a scientist seeking a cure to transform zombies back into humans. The end result is ""I Am Legend."" Will Smith has the ability to capture your interest in a move from the get go every time, making him a legend. He accomplishes this task once again in ""I Am Legend."" The true legend be told is this movie is a remake of a 1971 B Movie called ""The Omega Man,"" starring Charlton Heston which in return is based on a 1954 novel called, (yep you guessed it) ""I Am Legend."" Now we have gone full circle, ""I Am Legend"" 2007 is a dizzy display of so much CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) the film at times seems at best, very good cartoon animation. I'm the first one to agree that CGI special effect have added a great deal to the industry where before only hand made models with extreme limitation existed but CGI has some ways to go to prefect the technology. Some CGI turns out very well as Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park,"" or ""I Robot"" another Will Smith film but the CGI in ""I Am Legend"" is an over done potato, sorry to say.

I never read the book, but instantly picked up on the influence from the ""Night/Day/Dawn of the Dead"" movies.  In fact, that was basically what I expected to see: a remake of a ""dead"" movie with a bunch of flashy CGI effects and Will Smith one-liner quips.

Surprisingly, not only were the flashy CGI effects included, but the movie actually did have quite a bit of substance to it.  The Fresh Prince also only had a few one-liners, less it would have spoiled the overall dark tone of the movie.

Overall, it was enjoyable.  Just sit back, relax, and watch it.  Usually, I find Will Smith's movies enjoyable in a mindless sort of way, but he actually did strike a few chords of emotions in this movie.",1216944000,,763,4.446043165467626

1602867,5,B00005JPTK,"The movie, I Am Legend starring Will Smith, is based somewhat loosely on Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name.  Now, most people don't know who Richard Matheson is, but this is the writer who influenced both Stephen King and Dean Koontz where they were teenagers, not to mention thousands of other kids, myself included.  This was the man who wrote some of the most famous Twilight Zone episodes of the sixties, especially Nightmare at Thirty Thousand Feet.  This is the author of the famous horror novel, Hell House, which was also turned into a film.  Flipping the coin over, Matheson is author of the famous romance novel, Bid Time Return, and this was also turned into a major motion picture, though most people know it as Somewhere In Time.  There's also the novel and movie, What Dreams May Come.  Richard Matheson is therefore one of the greatest writers of the last half of the Twentieth Century.  Without him, we might not have had Stephen King and Dean Koontz writing such brilliant books.

I Am Legend with Will Smith is the third adaptation of Matheson's novel, and Mr. Smith does a truly excellent job of portraying the lead character Robert Neville, capturing his aloneness and near insanity at being quite possibly the only human being alive.  Neville was the military doctor experimenting with new drugs and viruses in the hope of finding a cure for cancer.  What was discovered, however, wiped out most of the human population, while changing those still alive into flesh-eating zombies, or vampires, that move at a tremendous speed and seemed to be filled with an incurable amount of rage and violence.  Because the creatures can't survive in the sunlight, Neville has control of the day when he and his German Shepard go out hunting for food and raiding the nearby DVD store.  Neville is also still searching for a vaccine that will cure the symptoms of the virus.  He uses zombies that he's captured, and the testing usually results in their deaths.  The night, however, is totally controlled by the creatures, and Neville must always be home by dark in order to barricade himself inside his Washington Square apartment with its reinforced doors and window shutters.  In time a confrontation is inevitable between Neville and the creatures, and this in turn eventually escalates into a full-blown battle at between life and death at the end.

I had mixed feeling about the movie when I first saw it at the theater.  When the Two-Disc Special Edition came out, I found myself enjoying the longer alternate version with a different ending.  I think the director, Francis Lawrence, and the Special Effects people did a fabulous job of creating New York City a few years down the road after the plague has done its nasty work, showing the desolate streets with non-moving cars and trash lining the curbs and weeds growing out of the pavement.  And, Will Smith, plays perfectly to this setting, creating a character that is near the end of his rope and talks to mannequins in the DVD store as a way of keeping himself from going crazy, then goes berserk when one of the mannequins shows up in a different location.  Unlike a lot of viewers, I loved the creatures.  The scene where Smith has to go into the basement of a bank to find his dog and runs into a group of them standing together in a group had me dropping popcorn all over my lap.  I felt myself in the darkness with him as well as the strong fear that he was experiencing.  This is definitely one of the best horror scenes done in the last few years.

I believe the Two-Disc Special Edition with a longer version of the film and an alternate ending is the way to go.  I do have to say that other than a different version of the movie, there isn't much else offered that I cared about.  The makers of the DVD set could've done a feature on the long history of I Am Legend with an in-depth interview from Richard Matheson and a more detailed look at the making of the film.  That will probably come in a later edition somewhere down the road.  Anyway, this is a good, fun movie with some superb acting by Will Smith.",1216425600,2,4100,4.625690607734807
1602868,4,B00005JPTK,"Based on the book by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend is the story of Robert Neville (Will Smith), sole survivor of a plague that, originally, was supposed to be a miracle cure for cancer three years before. Instead, most of the world died at the hands of the plague. Others mutated into bloodthirsty vampiric creatures; only a small percentage of humankind remained immune to the disease.

All alone in New York, virologist Neville tries to find a cure and ""fix"" the problem that stole the lives of everyone he knew and everyone he loved, while also trying to survive in a city infested with the infected and ferocious monsters.

Straight from the start you know you're in for a ride.

An empty city, overgrown and broken down.

A lone guy speeding through the streets in a fancy car, weapon at his side.

Animals prowling the streets, free of their cages.

The lock up.

The screams.

The howls.

Yeah, good stuff.

The intense feeling of atmosphere was what drew me into this flick. Immediately isolation sets in right from the first frame as we see Neville trying to maintain a normal life in a dead city (renting movies, talking to mannequins, keeping a routine), his eyes washed with pain yet underscored with determination to keep on going. This is a one-man show and I haven't seen it done so well since Cast Away (one of my favorite movies) years and years ago.

No complaints about Will Smith here and he's done a good job over his career to make you forget about the loud-mouthed homeboy he played in Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Plus, did you see the guy in this film? He's ripped! Shredded. But, I guess, you'd have to be if you lived a world where vampire-zombie-human things prowled the streets and your life could be in jeopardy at the drop of a hat if you weren't too careful.

Which brings me to the monsters in question. Overall, well done. Creepy skin, no hair, loud growls, amazing agility and intensely vicious. Yeah, killer. Obviously they were CGI so they did look a tad rubbery and there were a few moments where it felt I was looking at a cartoon. Thankfully, those moments happened so fast and the action was so intense that I quickly forgot my quibble and moved on.

My only thing was the ending. Now, I never read the book so I can't compare, but it ended too abruptly and really lost its post-apocalyptic feel in the last five minutes or so. Sort of a Disney ending, which didn't fit in with what was a gloomy story up until that point.

Regardless, if someone asked me what I thought of this film, I'd tell them to go see it.

It's that good.

1602869,5,B00005JPTK,"At the end of the movie you fail to realise it was just one man, Will Smith in most of the scences and yet the movie is neither boring, or lacking in elements that make for a great thriller. One stunning aspect of the movie is the great art direction. New York is bathed in vegetation and ruins that it is impossible to say it was a set. The scale of this set, whether it was computer aided or not, was breathtaking. However CG work on the zombies was poor. They looked too phony. In an era where special fx has been perfected to a science the zombies were unacceptable.

Will Smith's role, the story, screenplay and action were superb indeed. The way a lonely scientist lives to preserve his sanity, by play-acting - talking to the mannequins in the store as though they were real people, renting and returning DVD's besides other activities such as talking to his dog, saying the lines of the film, singing songs, cooking and not forgetting excercising are all very well done. The concept of defending himself from the zombies at night was also very cleverly and painstakingly done.

Two very thrilling points in the movie are 1. Smith's first confrontation with the zombies (for those who haven't seen the trailers it is a terrific relevation at that point) and 2. The sighting of the mannequin on the road and the scenes that follow when the zombies trick him and later attack him.

One question that lingered in my mind was why didn't Will Smith not test animals that survived the epidemic and find out a cure from their blood instead of testing himself and the zombies. The animals seemed to have survived the calamity perfectly.

Bob Marley's songs were another sweet plus to a movie as this. Redemption Song played at the end of the movie was the icing on the cake.

An alternative ending is being circulated on the net but this one in the original is certainly better. Full marks and highly recommended.",1216425600,,1912,4.578947368421052

They do play down the vampirism that the book describes but for the long run the movie is very entertaining.  Will smith portrays the protector of humanity in this epic film about humanity's demise at its own hands.  We believe to much in our superiority over nature and believe that we can alter DNA, splice genes and make other genetic modifications and then release these new things into the world without the slightest clue as to what will happen once they start to interact with the natural environment.

1602884,4,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith stars yet again in another film where he battles animated creatures.  First it was runaway robots in ""I Robot.""  Now, it's super strong mutants, products of a cancer treatment gone horribly wrong.  The bald mutants look very similar to the robots.

  ""I Am Legend"" is a remake of a remake.  The original is ""The Last Man on Earth.""  Made in the sixties, this film most closely resembles the novel on which it was based:  Richard Matheson's  ""I Am Legend.""  An airborne virus kills most of the human population which return as zombie-like vampires.  Vincent Price is Dr. Neville who's lost his family to the virus and searches for a cure while killing vampires in London.

  In the early seventies, Charlton Heston reprises the role as Dr. Neville in ""The Omega Man.""  Living in Las Angeles, he also searches for a cure while killing the mutants.  Those who do not die from the germ warfare are turned into psychotic albinos who are afraid of the light.

  Of the three movie, ""The Omega Man"" is superior because it has the most realistic plot and the better characterization.  The mutants are three-dimensional humans; they are not cartoon characters.  Neville has more interaction with the unaffected survivors, especially one female played by feisty Rosalind Cash.  There are also more twists and turns.  It has a delicious, downbeat ending that leaves us with a faint ray of hope for mankind.

  In ""I Am Legend,"" Will Smith is basically a one man show; it is him versus the cartoon characters.  The interaction between him and the dog is touching and very emotional.  However, I felt more sympathy with Vincent Price's Neville who watched his family slowly die of the plague.  He even encountered his wife's return as a vampire.

  Overall, ""I Am Legend"" is entertaining and suspenseful.  However, it is a disappointment for fans of the far more superior ""Omega Man.""  I strongly suggest that, if you liked ""I Am Legend,"" you obtain a copy of ""The Omega Man.""  You may enjoy it more.  If you are a fan of classic horror and/or Vincent Price, search out a copy of ""The Last Man on Earth.""",1215907200,3,2102,4.7229916897506925
1602885,3,B00005JPTK,"I have mixed feelings about ""I Am Legend""; Will Smith does very well as a one-man show throughout most of this film and captured the insanity that comes with the solitude very well. I especially liked the scene where he is alone in the DVD store saying to one of the plastic models: ""Hello"" and `say hello to me'. It really made me feel compassionate towards the character as I can't imagine what it's like to be so lonely you've resorted to speaking to inanimate objects as if they are real.

The most surprising part of the film is seeing a city, absent of life, at the beginning. It was kind of creepy with the one man, one dog and deserted land.

I think the zombies could have been made better; they could have been made to look more `real' as they appeared rather computerized. Otherwise, they added a layer of chilling horror to the film.

In the film, a sickness wipes out the world, Robert Neville (Will Smith) appears to be the only survivor, immune to the disease that has taken everyone else. While trying to avoid going `nuts', he perseveres in search for a cure for the disease that has killed off humanity and left the others as carnivorous zombies. This film contains some dark and rather cringe-worthy humour, but it seems appropriate in the setting of the film.

Altogether, I think the film is worth seeing but maybe not owning.",1215907200,,1347,4.530864197530864

As a Doctor, who supposedly is super-intelligent and tough, he should have shot his dog once it got infected, not slowly strangle it, each tear and emotion lovingly filmed as it leaks off Smith's close-up. And let me tell you, Vermont ain't that cold (plot hole #401), what about a NYC winter and the mutants?

Now, I never read I am legend but Will Smith is an amazing actor and one of the best, so I had to see this. I Am Legend is very simple, it almost even reminds you of Cast Away though there're more people or should I say creatures in this film.

Robert Neville is a Virologist Lieutenant Colonel for the U.S. Army. In an early scene in the film you see Neville rushing his family into a car while the rest of N.Y. is running scared in a panic. While Neville is explaining to his wife and real life daughter Marley what is going on, a sort of zombie looking creature hits their car.  It turns out that there has been an outbreak spread of a very lethal virus. Then you come to find out that Neville is the last healthy person in New York City and maybe even the world. He may be the last person but he is surely not alone.

First, I have no idea how Tom Hanks won for Cast Away and Smith doesn't receive anything. I say this because Will Smith just killed this role and if you don't believe me then just check it out. He is in the film by himself for most of its time but he your attention is never somewhere else. He honestly had me excited to see what would happen next. He even shows how hard it is to be by yourself for so long by making his dog his best friend and talking to a mannequin at a local video store.  His performance was flawless without a doubt. Without him, I don't see or think anyone else could have possibly played this role as well as him.

I thought that the creatures were very cool, not extremely scary but cool. I think the creatures could shock a few but not many but at the same time they create great suspense. You never really know what they're going to do, I loved that these things were also intelligent. The creature intelligence almost remind you of the zombies from George A. Romero's Land of the Dead.  I thought I Am Legend was a great movie, some may like it and some may not. I know some people that saw the preview and thought that the movie was a horror but trust me its not.

(without spoiling anything) Robert Neville is a colonel in the army who was charged with extinguishing the great viral outbreak that destroyed Earth's population. He decides to stay at what he calls ""ground zero"", b/c he truly believes that he can ""fix this"".

1602915,4,B00005JPTK,"I must admit that I came into my viewing of ""I Am Legend at a disadvantage. First, I haven't read the book upon which it was based (something I hope to correct soon). In addition, I'd heard much about the movie, both how brilliant Will Smith was in the role that had him alone on the screen for a significant portion of the movie, and also how the movie supposedly degrades in the last third. So when I finally got to see the movie last night, I was entirely unsure what to expect.

Having now seen ""I Am Legend,"" I believe that the movie will go down as one of the classics in science fiction cinema. The cinematography is outstanding. When you see the epic shots of New York having been reclaimed by the wilderness, now the domain for the likes of lions and deer, the streets either clogged with deserted cars or choked by vegetation, you really believe that you are in the midst of the greatest tragedy of our modern times. The story is masterfully told in such a way that rather than being forced through a long expositional section providing the back story, or subjected to drawn out flashbacks that interrupt the forward momentum, the past is revealed in brief flashbacks, video clips that Smith's character, Robert Neville, constantly plays on his television, and other subtle but prevalent clues like photographs and newspaper clippings that are cleverly positioned within various scenes throughout early parts of the movie. This film, unlike many others these days, doesn't operate under the assumption that its audience is fairly clueless. It respects its audience, and I very much respect the film for that.

Both Will Smith and his canine companion quickly become beloved friends whom you care for, which makes the twists and turns that occur later on all the more moving. When the enormity of the very fact that, in Neville's mind, he is the only living human left on the earth (besides the vampire-like creatures who used to be humans) hits you, you too begin to feel the weight of his loneliness and can then understand why he is in many ways slowly going insane. If not for the daily ritual that he's structured his life around, one gets the feeling that this man would have ended his own life long before. And there's something haunting about the base story here, that some tragic event could in fact leave a once life-filled metropolis like New York a cold, empty monument to a once mighty race of beings. Could our own quest for advancement one day be our undoing?

While I must admit that the movie does seem to rush toward the ending, with the climatic moments seeming to come too soon after a major plot twist changes Neville's entire world view, I don't have a problem with the way the story ends. I suppose the ending is more ""Hollywood"" and less ""deep"" than I assume that the book is, but the ending in itself is very well done, and given the ordeal that this character has gone through, is one that works well for me. I just wish more time had been spent getting us to the ending because what this movie had, which far too few movies in this genre have today, is a solid plot that fed both the appetite of the action junkie and the person who prefers a great story. Another minor fault I must hold against the film is the vampire creatures, who would have been far more compelling if they were played by real people rather than CGI. The only CGI character that has yet to truly come alive within a real world setting is Gollum from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and that character was built upon the brilliant acting of Andy Serkis.

""I Am Legend"" isn't perfect, and the fact that it came so close is what's most frustrating to me as a fan of both Will Smith and this genre of film, but what it does provide, it does so very well. This is a fun, thought-provoking film that years from now will be one of Smith's most lauded performances. I highly recommend it to everyone.

Dr. Nevel(smith) attempts to find a cure but ends up losing his best friend. if you love movies of extinction and the will power of man this movie is great!

1602919,1,B00005JPTK,If you read this book then you know that this movie has nothing to do with it.  Matheson creates a character that is so three demensional that whom ever Wil Smith playing was far from it.

1602920,4,B00005JPTK,"I am Legend is an absolutely brilliant and fascinating movie. Breathtaking scenery and an impressive silence which dominates a large part of the movie. As far as I am concerned it has only one slight flaw: the use of CGI generated creatures instead of flesh and blood actors. Why the makers opted for this is beyond me, because real actors would have been much cheaper I think and the creatures aren't exotic or weird at all, merely hyper-agressive zombies. In my opinion simple make-up would have done the trick quite excellently. It does not subtract from the tension, though, which is riveting, but for me it would have been the icing on top of the cake. For this reason and this reason only I award it 4 stars instead of 5. Now I must go and read the original novel by Richard Matheson as quickly as possible.",1214352000,,813,4.537414965986395
1602921,4,B00005JPTK,"This is the 3rd version of Richard Mathieson's story 'I Am Legend', and this easily holds its own as compared with 'The Omega Man' (Charlton Heston) and 'Last Man On Earth' (Vincent Price). I really wasn't expecting that much from the film. Obviously Will Smith was always going to be the films saviour even if it was a complete Turkey. But its not.

I agree with most previous reviewers that the first half is the best part of the film. However IMO the 2nd half and the special effects are nowhere near as bad as some reviewers have made out. Only at one point in the film did I think ""thats CGI"". Will Smith is very good and the errie deserted streets and his relationship with the dog are very well done.

The film is only 96 mins long, which is also in its favour. Unlike a lot of Hollywood blockbusters this doesn't feel like it should have much, if anything cut from it. Most crucially of all, Neville (Will Smith) was a sympathetic character. This film has that crucial element that is missing from so many bloated blockbusters - characters you care about.

On the downside there are a few contrived moments in the plot that I didn't really believe in. To some extent I agree with previous reviewers criticisms about the ending, but in the end the filmmakers just about got the balance between a completely happy ending and a resolutely downbeat one. Without actually giving away what happens at the end I can't say anymore than that.

This isn't quite 4 stars for me but its better than 3 and I recommend it.",1213920000,,1516,4.481884057971015
1602932,4,B00005JPTK,"I saw this film after it was released and I really loved it.  I've noticed that a substantial portion of the 1 star reviews are because the film strayed too far from the novel (which I have not read, so I didn't have that problem). I thought the movie as a whole was very well done, and its one of my favorite recent films.  My only gripe is that the alternate ending would have fit in much better than the ending that was shown in theatres(IMHO).  I also believe Will Smith did an excellent job.",1213920000,,496,4.2
1602933,4,B00005JPTK,"Although I'm a fan of Richard Matheson's work, I have yet to read his novel, I AM LEGEND.

I also haven't seen the first movie version with Vincent Price called THE LAST MAN ON EARTH.  I saw the cult favorite THE OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston years and years ago but I think I'll read the book and then watch that one again.  And maybe this one again.

This third version, thankfully keeping Matheson's great title, is well-made and entertaining but I thought the first half was stronger than the second half.  I liked Will Smith in I, ROBOT and he does a great job here as well, playing a dogged scientist hunting in an eerily empty New York City by day and searching for a cure to the plague virus by night.  (Years ago it had been announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger would play in this--imagine Dr. Arnold as a gov't scientist!)

The zombie/vampires were creepy enough but they were obviously computer generated.  I wished there had been more personality given to them and more personal conflict between Smith and the monsters (a relationship between the lead monster and a female monster Smith abducts to experiment on is hinted at but never developed any further).

Still, some great shots of NYC standing empty, overrun by weeds and deer.

When it was over, I said ""that was an hour and a half of my life I will never get back"".  The only reason I gave it 2 stars vs 1 was for the special effects/CGI.",1213660800,,325,3.6666666666666665
1602936,2,B00005JPTK,"The biggest problem with I am Legend is the same problem that Hollywood had with The Omega Man. All they have to do is to make the book from Richard Matheson into a film and don't add anything or take anything. Yet both times they have tampered with the material and both times they end up producing less than average results.

A doctor finds himself almost alone in a city trying to find a cure for a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong turning people into starving rabid but rapid zombie-ish type creatures that run through the night killing people. The action sequences are mostly of the nightstalker hunting or cure finding sort. Lots of the time Will Smith is left talking to himself, his dog or having flashbacks before the plague.

This latest attempt at I am Legend is not an outright disaster. The empty New York set design and Will Smith do save the dodgy CGI nightstalkers and a script that simply deviates too much from the original concept. It is still something you can watch, maybe even enjoy at times, but that is not the point. This is not I am Legend and that is bad because this simply isn't the film we wanted to see and it's the second time Hollywood has got it terribly wrong. It makes matters even worse that we have been waiting over 12 years for it since an Arnie version was announced but then dropped. Third time lucky maybe but not even three stars for this effort.",1213660800,3,1402,4.430232558139535

But, why is Will Smith in a remake with lots of computer enhancement which does not make the movie any better? (The first one looked like it was filmed in someone's garage)  Parts of this movie looks like the computer work which was done in a documentary on what the earth would look like if man disappeared.

I am a fan of the fine work which Will has done but this does not reflect any of the movies he has made.  If you are under 20 years of age, you will probably love this; if you are over 20, don't bother with it.",1213574400,4,704,3.9645390070921986

This version is exactly the same as the theatre version except with a different, more hopeful ending to it.

This alternate version has a totally different ending to the movie and it is stars above the theatre version. The ending was perfect and left a good feeling after the movie. The theatre version left a bad taste, the ending really sucked for a movie that had been good up until the ending.

I recommend this version of movie. If you haven't seen it yet, try this version first, leave the theatre version alone.

Saying that, this movie got the ""Legend"" completely wrong... but that's the 'third act collapse' and everyone goes on about that.

Saying that, none of this movie's flaws have anything to do with Will Smith.  Will Smith proved that he could really act as something other than ""Will Smith Versus The X"" in /Pursuit of Happiness/, and here he proves that he can act when he really does have the screen all to himself, with no one else but a dog to distract from him.  I actually think he even one-ups Tom Hank's performance in /Cast Away/, for *SPOILER ALERT* when his character actually meets another two live human beings, he's been alone for three years and has practically forgotten how to relate to them (Hanks' character seemed to adapt to his return to humanity almost instantly).

The only similarity pretty much is that the main character is named Robert Neville.  There's a few others such as he broadcasts for others to meet him at a peer if there is anyone else alive but 99% of this film has nothing to do with the masterpiece novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/1857988094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>.  Plus the 1% that is such as his apartment has reinforced shutter roller doors and other defences built in aren't relevant as we find out the vampires (and I'm just assuming they are vampires as that's what they were in the book but these things in the movie look more like something from The Mummy or Lord of the Rings, I guess we know why they didn't show them in the previews ie they were too embarrassed) don't even know where he lives and aren't as the main part of the book (which influenced many as subsequent living dead zombie film) attacking his home every night.

Some changes from the book obviously don't matter such Robert no longer being a blue eyed blond haired guy (although this would have been a great challenge and opportunity to fully test Will Smith's acting abilities) but the whole reason why Robert Neville was a legend in the book not being so in the film is simply unforgivable.  I mean that is the title of the book, the whole realisation of why he's a legend in the novel is the whole point of the title.  This film's reason, is poor and just unforgivable.

Great acting by the dog but it should have appeared much later in the film as it did in the novel which made way more sense and highlighted emotion of finding out your not the last living thing on the planet.

Even if you are someone who doesn't care that the plot has no similarities to the original book you have to acknowledge the serious holes in the plot line.  Not only did they instantly shatter the belief that he is the last living thing on earth but where did all these deer and lions come from at the start of the film since the bridges onto Manhattan were all destroyed? Have lions gone cool there are no humans alive in North America I think I will go for a swim across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa and live there now?  For that matter how did the creepy woman and kid get onto the island of Manhattan, and what's with the religious propaganda - ""God told me where to go.""

I recently saw a movie (won't mention the name) where the characters were so annoying I was cheering for the monster. I Am Legend is a high caliber movie in its genre and I've always thought Will Smith gives one hundred percent to all the roles he plays. This tale is a cautionary warning of how we humans can really mess up. A virus developed as a hopeful cure to cancer becomes a deadly infection that turns humans into hideous beings that hover in the dark, unable to live in the sunlight. Very few people are immune to it and the city of New York is closed off. Will Smith plays a doctor who dedicates the remainder of his life to try and find a cure, lonely and left only with his dog, our hearts ache for him. I must say the creatures were truly creepy.  They didn't go overboard on the effects, it's the subtle approach that makes them extremely horrid and too realistic looking. I always crave the truly happy ending, but what can I say, this film met me half-way in that area. Maybe some of us need to get over our happy ending cravings.

1603016,3,B00005JPTK,"According to a NY Times article on 5/26/08, Warners is concerned at the soft sales of their movie ""I Am Legend."" Warners might want to consider the fact that it is a rather average movie of little staying power. It did well in theaters, but few movie-goers would, I think, ever want to visit it a second time. That tacky, pseudo-happy ending (which totally subverted the wonderfully poetic meaning of the title in the original novel)is a primary reason for the film's lack of impact. Smith too is average: that seems to be a reason for his appeal, and I predict it will be a reason that he too will eventually lack staying power.

SPOILERS AHEAD

There are no ""vampires"" in the movie. There are no ""zombies."" The agressive creatures are mutated and hairless, but still retain intelligence, and don't hunt people to bite their necks and drink their blood. They're methodical and simply sensitive to light.

The venue is NYC, as always, and that's disappointing. Horror/sci-fi movies make it seem that nothing catastrophic could ever happen elsewhere.

I teared up when Will Smith had to kill his dog, his only friend and companion. At the time, as far as he knew, he and his dog were the only non-violent creatures that existed.

The part about the lady who showed up and said God had told her where to go was just absolutely silly. They could have put a much better spin on why she was going where she was going.

Sounds like I didn't like the movie, but I really did. There were a lot of other realistically unbelievable aspects (like the fact that humans typically become psychotic without other human contact over long periods of time), but the movie was well worth watching, beyond the crazy, non-sci-fi aspects of it.",1211760000,2,1284,4.709821428571429

Will Smith is the only survivor (this is all conveyed at face value in the first moments of the film, for viewers of truncated IQ, don't worry, you don't have to think too hard to work it out).

Will Smith (aka Robert Neville, a scientist with military connections) is the only man left on a post human manhattan - overgrown with weeds, buildings falling into decay and blasted bridges (the Brooklyn Bridge, despite being a suspension bridge, only seems to have lost its middle span). Leaping deer and barking dogs roam around the island by day, more sinister creatures prevail at night (the post human mutants) so Neville has to sleep cradling a gun in his bath in his heavily fortified apartment with only Sam, his faithful German shepherd for company).

Neville, despite being the only human around, still manages to pick up electricity and fresh water. (He also works out fanatically to keep his abs sharp, and doesn't let his hair grow long or grow a scruffy beard, despite that fact that there are no women left to justify all that grooming). He goes slightly nuts devoid of human company, talking to his dog, and broadcasting on the airwaves to see if anyone is around.

The first moments of the film have some interesting scenes in the lab as Neville experiments on gollumesque GCI creatures to see if he can establish why the cancer cure went wrong, and how he can reverse the strain and keep human life going in the most unpromising of circumstances. Dangers and madness assail Neville each day. He befriends two mannequins in a DVD store, and is disturbed to discover they have moved outside the store one morning. He loses his beloved dog, Sam, after he is bitten by mutant dogs who are released after a snare trap disables Neville and has to put him down. His experiments to cure the mutant grotesques and restore human life constantly founder. He is constantly threatened by the grotesque creatures who have done for everyone else who attack him in all manner of ghoulish CGI ways. Through flashbacks it is revealed that his attempts to airlift his family out of Manhattan in the US exodus from Saigon type scenes failed, and his family have all perished, along with he presumes every other human on earth.

Being Hollywood, light comes in (sadly around the same moment as the budget clearly runs out and the director realised the movie needs to wrap up in a swift conclusion having blown a cool $15 million on a Brooklyn Bridge scene).  Neville encounters other people who save him after an attack - a woman and her son who survived the disaster after being on an Brazilian Red Cross ship. Together, they work on an experiment to cure a mutant woman. This time it works, but Neville tragically perishes as the compound is attacked by CGIs). However he justifies his legend status by saving their lives to recreate humanity in the image of a Ronald Reagan wet dream - a beautiful clapboard village in tree dappled Vermont.",1211068800,2,3158,4.693140794223827

1603063,4,B00005JPTK,"I enjoyed this movie despite a few flaws. Smiths acting was credible, as was the supporting cast. A cure for cancer has been found. Unfortunately, it is in the form of a virus and apparently the virus mutates and rips apart the world as we know it.  Vincent Price and Charleton Heston both dealt with similar problems. I liked Anthony Zerbe's (THE OMEGA MAN) 'crazy' a tad better than the one here in I AM LEGEND, but this is still a decent movie.

POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: (A gentleman elsewhere was upset when I mentioned someone's death scene in KNOCKAROUND GUYS, and maybe he was right. So from now on I'm trying to give fair warning.)  When the girl and her son decided to meet him at the dock, didn't she have any plans on where she was spending the night with the 'crazies' running loose? And for someone new to the big city, she certainly found her way around town beautifully. What did the female 'crazy' he had strapped down to the table in the lab eat?  When did she eat?  How is it someone so over-the-top insane managed to figure out how to set up a trap for Smith's character?  How did he still manage to have gasoline after three years?  You would think he could have found tons of dry dog food right after the disaster, so why not store it in the basement or something instead of feeding that poor dog...whatever he was feeding her.

If you just take it as a movie it is an average movie and most of the stuff was acceptable hollywood fun. But there are two things about this movie that make it just a little bit special:

Peppered through Will Smith's Mansion are some actual Van Gogh Paintings. I mean the real thing. I read that they actually got to use the real ones in the movie. The camera, director, actors, don't focus on the paintings. They are just there - and they are absolutely magnificent. You can't help but be drawn to them.

And they are there in the movie for a reason. The movie is all about the potential end of humanity and the pictures say (without uttering a word) that humanity, is sometimes capable of a beauty that goes beyond words. Breathtaking.

Also, Will Smith launches into a little soliloquy about Bob Marley that comes very close to the same effect. It will choke you up even if you never heard a single Bob Marley song.

Because they are so different it is almost a contradiction to use Bob Marley and Vincent Van Gogh in the same movie as examples but that is the beauty of humanity.",1210809600,,1535,5.352697095435684

1603072,3,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith's performance is incredible, as is his canine companion. But I Am Legend falls victim to two things plaguing Hollywood these days:

- Overreliance on CGI: This movie would have been much better served using live actors than CGI. The ""uncanny valley"" phenomenon is epitomized in this film, and the reliance on computer imaging takes away from the experience.

- Bittersweet ending: Those who have read Richard Matheson's novel know that there is no bittersweet ending involved. Instead, the movie took a turn for the worse in the second half with the introduction of a seemingly useless character who serves only as a plot device. The holes punched into the storyline by her addition show the absurdity of changing the original plot.

This is worth a rental, but ultimately I walked out of the theater disappointed by the second half of the movie.

The first half of the movie met, and exceeded, my expectations for a decimated world populated by feral humans, and Will Smith.  Exciting, with amazing visuals, and Will Smith's portrayal of the last man on Earth - Neville.  Torn by loneliness; racked by horror at the terrible turn his efforts to help humankind took; and survivor's guilt.  The efforts to live day to day, and the constant fear wearing away at Neville's humanity.  The first half of the movie is electric!  The last half of the movie is so bad, it seems that a different movie was tacked onto the end.

SPOILERS----SPOILERS----SPOILERS

Those infected with the virus are not shown until half way through the movie.  The director was wise to take the ""Jaws"" approach in not showing the antagonists, as their appearance is more cartoony than frightening.  The infected people have the energy level, and attitude, of an angry house cat, with the appearance of, well, hairless CG people.  The director always uses the startle factor to introduce the infected onto the screen.  Probably because the infected aren't particularly startling in, and of, themselves.  At least one of the infected show that they are capable of higher thought, through cunning and tool use, but for some reason - a) Neville does not seem to notice this fact, even though he is a victim of it; and b) the infected folks ability to do more than scream, run, and eat is abruptly dropped from the film, as though it had never happened.

The human acting performances in the second half of the film go from 60 to zero in 10 seconds.  There is a lot of staring between the actors at this point.  Perhaps, they were emoting, but it came across as simply staring.  Lifeless.  Boring.  Kind of silly.  The movie finally ends (thank goodness) with a big unhappy (Boom!), and a big happy (Hurray. We're not alone.).

The movie starts as a fast-paced roller coaster ride, and ends as a slow, dull, still photo.  The first half of the film is 5 star, all the exciting way!

1603147,3,B00005JPTK,"I love Will Smith and have always enjoyed his films. So, when I heard he was doing this remake of the book, ""I Am Legend"", Richard Matheson's masterpiece of horror, I could not wait to see the film. Having already seen the two prior adaptations, ""The Omega Man"", starring Charlton Heston,  and ""The Last Man on Earth"", starring Vincent Price, I looked forward to seeing what this remake would bring to the table.

This is an interesting adaptation of the book in many ways, capturing the essence of despair, loneliness, and hope that runs through the book and transferring it successfully to film.  Here, Will Smith is cast as Robert Neville, a military scientist who finds that he is immune to the virus that has run amok and globally killed off most of the population or turned them into vampire-like killers who dwell in the dark, coming out only at night where they prowl the earth seeking other living creatures to nosh on.

Robert Neville seems to be the only human being left in New York City. Coming out by day with his beloved dog, Sam, which is his only companion, Neville hunts for food and necessities, taking care to get home before night fall. He lives in solitary splendor in his town house in Washington Square Park, where he struggles to find a cure for the virus in hopes of restoring humanity to those rabid creatures that were once human and now prowl the earth at night.

The bleak landscape of a New York City that is  ravaged by the changes is compelling, and Smith, as Neville, does exude that pathos of a man who has nearly lost all hope. His attempts at communicating with other human beings that have not been transformed by the virus are touching, especially so when we see how he longs for interaction with others like himself.

Unfortunately, the film becomes undone by too much reliance on computer generated monsters, failing to realize that less is sometimes more.  Instead, the special effects render the second half of the film to something that one would see in a video game. Consequently, I found myself hoping that the end of the film would soon arrive.

While I did enjoy the film overall, it was, ultimately, disappointing, as my expectations were so high. It is unfortunate that the powers that be were so enamored of the special effects that they were unable to show some restraint. What was potentially a filmmaking masterpiece turned into a film that was simply a contender, despite Will Smith's excellent performance. In the end, it was a performance that was overshadowed by the filmmaker's excess.",1210204800,4,2544,4.724604966139955

1603152,3,B00005JPTK,"I was really depressed at the end of this movie.  I'm not sure if it was because the movie did such a good job with its theme or just because it was depressing.

Some elements were excellent.  Will Smith had a heavy load to carry in this movie and he is great in it.  His loneliness is palpable -- talking to mannequins he set up in the video store where he checks out the movies in alphabetical order and listening to old recorded newscasts.  The scene where he flips out because one of his ""friends"" has been moved shows how close to the edge his loneliness has brought him.

I also loved the CGI New York landscape.  It seemed very realistic.  And finally, the animated short stories included in the DVD were quite interesting.

I wasn't as fond of some other elements.  The ""monsters"" looked too much like Gollum and too much uniformly alike; they would have been better done with actors and more individual makeup.  Also, it was not clear whether they were devolved to a purely animal level or if they still retained intelligence.  That made the scene with the moved mannequin and the rope trap a little confusing.  Did they set the trap or was Neville so on edge that he forgot one of his own traps?  It was also not clear what the infected ate with only Neville left as potential prey.  And if animals could be infected, why was Neville hunting deer that didn't act infected?

As great a job as Will Smith did playing his part, the amount of time with just one actor and a dog on screen was too long and the flashback scenes didn't provide enough explanation of how it was that Neville became the last surviving person on Manhattan, much less how the virus killed off most of the world.

And finally, a caution for people who still have older analog TVs:  this movie is visually dark and that resulted in many scenes that were just black screens with the music track in the background.  I suspect there was stuff that people with larger digital TVs would be able to see.",1209945600,,1977,4.426592797783933

It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.

And what's more.  I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice.  He does ""big budget"" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal.  His ""Wild Wild West"", ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I Robot"", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.

""Hitch"" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.  Any actor could have replaced him in all those films of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me.  I guess I just don't care for his choices in his movie career.

1603218,3,B00005JPTK,"I read the book. Twice. Well, not really. I read it and I listened to the unabridged audiobook. I took one look at Will Smith walking the streets of a desolated New York, playing what in the book was a blonde white dude in an equally ruined Los Angeles, and I knew that they weren't sticking to the book like glue, which is fine.

Let's be real. Will Smith is cool and New York makes for a far better wasteland than L.A.; so who cares? I don't. Monsters from L.A. would be too busy looking in the mirror, but New York monsters... New Yorkers are already creatures of the night and also rude as hell on their best days, so they'd make awesome gangrel man-eaters. Besides, I have come to accept that movies are generally never like the book, the book is always better... you know the speech.

As long as the story remains the same, the theme and the message from the book is still there, I have no gripe when filmmakers break from the book here and there. The problem is they did not bother at all. They took the title, and made some other version of ""28 Days Later""

Moving right along, I'll make believe there isn't a book. I'm not going sit here and regurgitate what you read in other reviews before mine in regards to the book vs. the movie. That they didn't recreate the book 100% is not a good reason to shun this film. It's worth watching... once.

First, Will Smith is fan-tastic.

The setting and tone of the movie makes for a mild horror film that's hard not to be drawn into. Me? I love post-apocalyptic stuff. As much as I would hate to be there, I often wonder how people would cope after being stripped of everything that makes life simple for most of us. Having this guy, Robert Neville, the last human on Earth, having to compete with a new species is still interesting material. Vampires? Who needs em? We know their routine back and forth anyway. You won't miss them... unless you're a goth.

Watching Will hunting, gathering, seeing deer and stuff graze grass from the broken pavement, being preyed upon by lions and... what were they... infected zombies, or whatever, and conversing with mannequins out of loneliness; that's just great stuff to see, and it gives the movie an emotional edge that's missing in most scary movies. I loved all of that.

They kind of failed to deliver the other half of what makes scary movies great. Don't get me wrong. There were some real tense moments; you find that these monsters aren't stupid when they lay a trap that Will stumbles into. Good stuff; some tenseness, you'll be waiting for things to jump out, and they do, but there is little violence, which yes, irked me.

I was like, ""Come on, I get that you can't mess up the last man alive too much, but since you're doing flashbacks anyway, how about some memories of zombie rampage; people being ripped up and devoured like little turkeys, gobbling in helpless terror? Give us an idea of what Will has to look forward to if he messes up just a little."" Nope.

I mean, they make a movie with zombies, or whatever they were, and though it's a clear threat, they don't give us much of what makes these kinds of movies really thrilling-- blood and limb ripping.

You know what really disappoints me though? When Will is out there, in one scene, if you look up there is a movie billboard displaying the Batman symbol with Superman's crest inside of it suggesting that a Batman/Superman film was forthcoming. Stupid Emma Thomson had to make her ""cure"" for cancer and now both Christian Bale and Brandon Routh are frikin zombies (probably looking at themselves in the mirror somewhere in ""infected"" L.A.) and they never got to release what would have been a much more exciting movie than ""I Am frickin Legend""!

But anyway...

As much as I think one might enjoy watching this movie once, to me, it doesn't have the kind of re-playability that would justify buying this on DVD let alone Blu-Ray. For sure, see it. The movie had its moments. I enjoyed it, but it left a lot to be desired.

Forgetting that the guys who made this flick did not read the book at all and completely missed the target that the book hit hard. This movie is just okay, ""weaksauce"" as a friend of mine would put it.

It is worth watching for the effects, which are brilliant, and Will Smith is always watchable, but it adds nothing in terms of telling the story to the original version.

I'm also against the idea of including the alternating ending, which just seems like a cop out to me.

The Blu-ray contains two versions of the film, the original and the alternate ending. The alternate is a must see for fans of the book because it actually comes a lot closer to what Matheson was going for and the point he tried to get across.

I Am Legend is a very good action/suspense movie that is not afraid to switch from very emotional scenes to ones of intense action. The blu ray version looks amazing and the run down streets and buildings serve as a very powerful image with lots of detail as nature looks to take it all back.

1603238,5,B00005JPTK,"After seeing this film in theaters I went out and purchased the novella upon which it is based.  While I was fascinated by the film, the book is far superior.  Rather than being a family man and scientist attempting to cure the virus, Neville is an ordinary man who takes it upon himself to kill as many of the infected as possible.  Ultimately he realizes that the creatures he hunts are not necessarily evil, but that there has been a paradigm shift:  humanity has ""evolved"" and he is the evil ""legend"" unmercifully killing those that are normal.  I found that version more compelling as the Neville portrayed there more closely resembles what I believe to be the average American male.  Also, that version of the story is significantly more intellectually intriguing.

While the alternate version contained in the DVD/HD DVD/Blu-ray version is different in several ways from the book, in ways that I will not mention so as not to spoil the book for those who have not yet read it, I think that it contains that intriguing paradigm shift theme around which Matheson based his story.  Obviously Hollywood is going to take creative license with a film in their adaptation, but if they would have instead released this ""alternate version"" in theaters I think that they would have had a more successful film as it would have well adapted the story to make it more exciting while retaining the intellectual elements.  Well, at least they included it on the DVD!",1209254400,,1458,4.776892430278885
1603239,4,B00005JPTK,"Usually I will read the book first but in this case seeing the trailer being played over and over stimulated my curiosity to the point of no return. Being a New Yorker made the whole experience really fun and interesting; recognizing sights I pass on my way to work every day with an eerie feeling of abandonment was something totally different. I would often think in my head about how crowded it gets and how I wish people would just go away but seeing it all empty and overgrowing with grass like a wild safari was worse than I could have imagined. I guess its better the way it is than suffering eternity alone the same way Robert Neville has.

Alone except for the companionship of Samantha, the loyal German Shepherd, Neville is hunting wild deer and gathering food growing amok through the city while punctually seeking shelter as soon as the day light ends. When darkness approaches so do the mutated bodies that were once human but now reduced to vampire like creatures who savagely will hunt and devour any living creature. His only mission left is finding the cure than can turn the beasts back into the living before he goes mad form being alone. Things start going wrong when Neville stops being the hunter and starts becoming the hunted, the dark alleys that look ominous contain something that is keen ob bringing him down. His daily routing gets disturbed and he can no longer live peacefully with the hopes of one day saving everyone, he needs to find the cure fast or he too will succumb to the dire fate that all others have met.

Visually stunning the movies makes you care for Neville, who was very well portrayed by Smith. He was alone but not overly distressed or crazed, he exercised, rented videos, cooked, watched Shrek and tried to stay as close to being sane as possible. The scary parts made me jump and yell at the TV the same way guys do when they watch sports but overall it was a fun and wild experience and it really made me want to read the book to see what the original idea for this story was. I wish there was less CG effects these days but so many movies are full of them that one can't not see them for just this one reason. Other than that this was a real blast and I will want to see it again soon.

Seeing New York city overrun by nature with absolutely no hint of human life definitely struck a nerve with both me and the audience, and the best part is that the camera never tries to show off the impressive visual effects (most of which are entirely invisible). The focus is on the main character, as it should be, as well as how the outbreak happened and how he struggles to fix what he started. Millions of ""Virus Outbreak Mutation"" films have been devised over the past few decades, which makes I Am Legend even that much more impressive. It never feels like it belongs in the genre due to the multi-layered nature of the piece, as well as the clever progression and documentary-like feel.

1603283,2,B00005JPTK,"Give director Francis Lawrence this much credit for his work in ""I Am Legend:"" He knew how to stick a sword in its belly. The movie is all kinds of ridiculous - in part because it holds its cards practically *inside* the vest for the opening act - and Lawrence, instead of succumbing to hubris and letting it drag on for a craptacular two-and-a-half hours (like most blockbusters these days) he ends it, mercifully, at 90 minutes. Yeah, maybe it's because the zombies look like Bat Boy from the Weekly World News, but still - brevity is a virtue.

Stripped of all the subplots that made Richard Matheson's source novel so compelling (and the inspiration for some good films, comics, and books since its printing in the 1950s), ""I Am Legend"" is a vaguely intriguing ""Cast Away"" vehicle for Will Smith until it must deliver some action goods, which is does efficiently and without any particular rules or sense whatsoever, before closing on a old fashioned Blow Up Real Good sequence. This explosion, really, is the perfect ending for the film Lawrence actually made. Some moviegoers - who have invested far too much thought in this lame experience - prefer the ""alternate ending."" Not I, for reasons that simply don't matter.

Smith is Dr. Robert Neville, the last ""survivor"" in New York City of a cancer vaccine gone viral. Most New Yorkers died upon contracting the illness; others mutated into rubber-faced, physically amazing zombies that hate the sunlight, even though, unlike the spiritually touched vampire, they're simply mutations, which means they'd need sunlight to...oh, never mind. If you want to believe the sun could crash into a black hole and these creatures could survive, go ahead. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman provides all of this with a somber sincerity that informs the movie's look and tone in the first half-hour; Neville and his German shepherd stalk the streets of an overgrown NYC in near silence, as Lawrence keeps the soundtrack music to a minimum. Like ""Cast Away,"" it's compelling to hear the sounds of the world in this film. Unlike ""Cast Away,"" it also seems like a way to blow 30 minutes without having to show those ridiculous zombies.

So Neville's still after a cure for the mutation, and he carefully orchestrates traps so he can capture ""subjects"" for tests; despite the end of civilization, all of the utilities still work and the gas pumps aren't dry, so Neville uses a giant, state-of-the-art lab for his work. The zombies seem to be getting smarter, though, plotting their own revenge on the ""hunter."" Sandwiched in there are some flashbacks of NYC's last night as a living (and implausibly civilized) city and the fate of Neville's wife and daughter. These are effective enough, but they're also cheat, really - the movie doesn't want to give Neville the same struggle he has in the novel.

It's right about then that Lawrence gets his hustle on; Goldsman shuttles a couple more survivors onscreen so the title can make the least bit of sense, but Neville doesn't want much to do with them. There's a raid, a showdown, and a big boom. Or, if you prefer, the alternate love-in. Blammo. Over.",1209168000,,3132,4.859550561797753

Will Smith is simply outstanding, and creates a role both convincing and provoking.  His companion also does an amazing job and combined really made me care about their outcome enough to see this movie through, white knuckles and all.

Also, the best part about this action thriller is that it wasn't an all out blood and gore fest.  Where most films of this kind capitalize on making the audience squirm in their seats, this film is a psychological thriller.

While I won't spoil it for those who still wish to view this movie, the disappointing part for me was in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  I suppose someone didn't like the CGI graphics and thought that it looked too fake.  Well CGI has yet to look otherwise, but I didn't think it looked fake and believed that they did a great job with the design, sets, action, definitely the fear factor, and most certainly the remaining storyline up until the last part of the movie.

It was so disappointing as if the writers simply didn't know how to end the movie so they put together something last minute, stuck some gum on it, and sent it to final editing to get it produced for theaters.  It's just too bad because this film deserved so much better.

1603360,5,B00005JPTK,"A lot of the negative reviews have pointed out that it's a terrible adaptation of the book by Richard Matheson, but I simply have to say that it's a standalone movie that takes the plot outline from the book and puts its own spin on things. On its own this film is a very emotional, intense, and at times quite a frightening movie that will have you thinking that this is possibly Will Smiths best performance to date.

A cure for cancer is created from a genetically modified disease, but this cure turns into an infection of its own and soon spreads across the world killing most of the worlds population and turning the rest into mutated vampires which have fed on those last few survivors. Robert Neville is a former Army Lieutenant Colonel/Scientist who is forced to have his family taken away from him whilst he stays in the quarantined New York City looking for a cure to the mutated virus. His daughter hands him her dog, Sam before they take off in a helicopter. 3 years down the line and the human population of New York and possibly the world have died out and Robert is possibly the only human survivor. As he still battles to find a cure we are given an insight into how Robert copes with possibly being the only surviving human on Earth. He sets up mannequins in stores, pretends like their real people and interacts with them as if they were actually living. The Dog Sam is his only companion in the movie and we come to appreciate and love the relationship that develops between Robert and his Dog. One scene in particular that shows the intense emotion that this film reaches from time to time, is when Robert is cradling Sam in his arms after Sam is attacked by mutated dogs. Due to open wounds Sam is infected with the virus and Robert is forced to kill Sam. This, to me is a very upsetting scene and personally had me on the verge of tears, this shows the pure acting skill of Will Smith and proved to the critics that he was perfect for the role. The mutants in the film for the times that we see them are very intimidating and the chase scenes are quite intense and place you on the edge of your seat.

Will Smith has always been one of those actors that a lot of people would doubt until they saw him in a movie or playing any particular role. I have to admit I had my doubts about him playing the last man on Earth and had my reservations about a film like this altogether as you would have to be prepared to sit through a movie with just the one human character on screen for the larger portion of the film and I had my reservations as to how this would play out altogether. Once putting the movie on, my doubts were simply put to rest as from the first scene Will Smith enraptures you in intrigue as you're shown how the man is hunting down his food in the form of a deer. The action sequences are intense and all scenes featuring the mutants are unbelievably frightening, even more than I thought they would be.

This is a genuinely great movie and on Blu-Ray it's made much better with the alternate version parallel to the original cinematic version. This is a gem of a movie that I think all Will Smith fans will adore and even if you're not a fan of his previous work, this will make you want to see more.",1208822400,,3236,4.310344827586207

1603434,3,B00005JPTK,"(Spoilers involving the book ""I Am Legend"" lie ahead)

There is something about post-apocalyptic tales and zombie horrors that fascinate us and draw us in.

This is a taut and fairly suspenseful scifi/horror film that kept my attention. It is better than what I expected. When I learned that Hollywood was doing a film of my favorite vampire story (the third film version so far based on Richard Matheson's gripping novella), I winced and groaned. They'll ruin it, I thought. Well, the film is not bad. That being said, it's not excellent either.

The digital zombies are just that. Digital-looking, if you get my meaning. Why do so many CGI monsters look unrealistic? I can't put my finger on it. Could be skin tones, or a certain lifelessness in the eyes, or the way they move? Hard to pinpoint. But these rabid monsters were cumbersome looking. They were loud and big, but not frightening enough for me. I felt half the time like I was watching a video game. The closeups especially were awful, reminding you that this face was created on a laptop by some guy with orange Cheese Doodle grit all over his fingers. And yet the zombie lab rats (and the zombie dogs in the city) were freaky scary. Go figure.

There are some positive things about the movie. Silences instead of musical score accentuate the suspense; particularly in scenes such as when Robert Neville is looking for his dog Sam in some creepy, dark rooms. Incidental music would possibly have taken away from the feeling of dread in sequences like that. I liked the quiet. It was scary and tense.

The movie doesn't become too much of a zombie flick; it remains more of a character study involving a man who has passed the edge of sanity but is fighting hard to crawl back. Will Smith is good, as usual. I don't think there's much he couldn't do as an actor.

There's very little handheld, 'cinema verite' style camera work, I am happy to report. Lately a few horror movies are copying the visual style of The Blair Witch Project.

There will be people who see this film and want to bury it in their back yard or hide it in the freezer along with Bambi, Charlotte's Web, and Old Yeller. I just hope they do not dismiss this film simply because it is realistic and sometimes sad. Those who have seen the movie know what I am referring to. I must confess that I had tears in my eyes at one point. Luckily the scene was handled very discreetly; but any way you do it, it's still heartbreaking.

This is a loose interpretation of the book. People looking for a faithful adaptation will be sour after seeing this. After I read the book (many moons ago) I had it in my mind as a movie. It was so involving and scary. There was a scene in the book in which Robert Neville is driving home in the late afternoon and discovers that his wristwatch has stopped, and dusk is fast approaching. I was on the edge of my seat. Would he make it home safely before they came out of their hiding places? Good stuff. This sequence, unfortunately, was foolishly and sadly left out of this film. Heaven knows why. I was hoping it would be included. Hollywood seldom gets it right.

Bottom line: the film isn't atrocious. I enjoyed it because I didn't compare it too much to its source material. I would call it more thriller than outright horror.",1208649600,4,3289,4.50503355704698

1603436,1,B00005JPTK,"Dr. Robert Neville seems to have more incarnations than Sherlock Holmes at this point.

It would seem unlikely that this movie could be compared in anyway to the original short story / novella that shares the same title. In fact, the title might just be the only similarity. My Chinese wife, when she heard about them remaking this - yet again, said: ""Robert Neville is very repetitively described as a blonde haired, blue eyed white man in the book. Will Smith? I gotta see that."" Needless to say, the horror and action fan that she is, she was heavily disappointed in this as it seemed to be its own entity, instead of sharing even the most remote similarity with the book or even the previous films in any way conceivable.

I guess it would be foolish to state that this is the only film to have deviated so far, but we all know that isn't the truth by a long shot.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Man/dp/B000VAHR14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Running-Man/dp/B0001932ZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Running Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Recall/dp/B00070FX5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Recall</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B00005JL78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B000UD0ESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>&nbsp;all differ from their original source material - some heavily while others subtly. Who's to say whether this practice is right or wrong? Some of these films are blockbusters while others are heavily dated and total flops. Apparently, Matheson, not only approved of this version, but stated that he thought it was the best so far. Maybe he was referencing the size of the licensing contract and repetitive royalty amounts, surely he couldn't be favouring this over the Charleton Heston version.

But what is it about Hollywood that seems to believe that good books just don't translate onto the screen? All the films I previously mentioned are decent books that would've made good direct adaptations, and I can say this confidently because the adjusted adaptations were nothing memorable or impacting, all with the exception of Blade Runner. Giving credit where credit is due,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B00003CXA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>&nbsp;made an interesting adaptation from a sub-par book to an excellent film.  But this type of foolish recklessness is unfortunately more prevalent in the Science-Fiction genre when it comes to adaptations.

When I saw this movie at Target, it was on sale for $15.99, but beside it was another version for $24.99 that had the `controversial ending'. So, now, we must either pay an extra ten bucks to see the version where the Vampire Zombies have any level of noticeable intellect and show a glimmer of cunning, or we end up getting both versions for $35, because we just HAVE to see the other version. They used to market these `other versions' for two or three dollars more, which I used to have no problem with, but this is just unforgivable. Double-dipping is understandable in some cases, like with `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Darko/dp/B00005V3Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Darko</a>'. Numerous years passed until the Director had a chance to make his desired corrections, and when they were made,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/another-DVD/dp/B0006GAOBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">another DVD</a>&nbsp;was released. What `I Am Legend' is trying to do is just foolish. The alternate ending is not worth the ten dollars, so save your money. And, sigh ... don't worry what I just told you is nothing close to a spoiler. So if you haven't seen any of the films or ever read the book, you're none the wiser, but hopefully a little more informed.

I also found the use of the soundtrack was superficial and annoying. A lot of opportunities were wasted on this film, the soundtrack is probably one of the biggest ones, as it could've equated into more revenue for the producers and distributors of this let down. `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>', a film that really raised the bar on these type of `chaos reality' films, has a groundbreaking soundtrack with even a few tracks (18 and 20) that are deeply reminiscent of the score that was used in `The Omega Man' and were quite moving. The majority of James Newton Howard's score wasn't even used in the film. The film was overwrought with so much Foley nonsense (action, explosion, sound effects) that the actual composition for this movie had been dialed into the off position or forgotten about entirely. Shame on the mix done in post by the sound board hacks guzzling diet Pepsi. James Newton Howard may have attempted to repeat his success here from the `Batman Begins' soundtrack, but apart from a few memorable moments, the majority of the musical score here is just way too slow, boring and very forgettable.

Since I've noted `28 Days Later', let me just say that that `film' probably had a lot of creative impact on this `movie' from its inception or first utterance of ""let's remake `The Omega Man'"". `28 Days Later' and `28 Weeks' later recouped more money than either of their primary budgets, thus sending signals to Hollywood, that these types of films would essentially be good vehicles for their leading stars. The problem here is that even though you put bankable stars into a bankable idea it doesn't necessarily equate to a success. Also '28 Days Later' is probably the high water mark of all horror zombie films. Danny Boyle set the bar so high that other imitators will likely fail to even come within groveling distance.

This movie's major flaws were the deviation in the writing and not adhering to enough of the other films or the original novella. Reciting lines from `Shrek' when confronted with other survivors was also another poor use of story, viewer time and appreciation of the material or the genre. The use of the mannequins was a nice touch to the creepy, artsy feel that was readily prevalent in `The Omega Man' but it just wasn't enough to admit that it's a worthy adaptation. These writers need to be sent to the unemployment office -- asap.",1208649600,18,7239,5.900763358778626
1603437,4,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith seems to gravitate towards Sci-Fi and carries this burden well.  He plays it straight and lends a certain credibility to this often scoffed at venue.  This is the 3rd film to adapt Richard Matheson's 1950-something novel.  Smith follows the sinister Vincent Price and the iconic Charleston Heston as the solitary leading man.  I've seen them all and Will is the hands down winner.

The current incarnation of Matheson's novel has Smith as a virologist who has helped develope a strain that is touted to be a cure for cancer.  Apparertly, it does cure the cancer but in the ""piper must be paid"" price tag, it also mutates into a ""rabies like"" form.  The age old question: ""pick your poison"" is taken to new heights.

Smith spends his days prowling New York City for food and supplies with his dog.  Nature is creeping back into the city in the form of foliage and foraging wild amimals.  He lives in a heavily fortified vault to avoid the night-time marauding of the rabid vampire types of humans left alive.

Smith is a powerful presence on the screen and can carry off this one man show without working up much of a sweat.  I've always respected him as an actor but after seeing this film I hold him in even higher esteem.  bg",1208649600,,1238,4.547511312217194

1603523,2,B00005JPTK,"SPOILERS BELOW

I honestly thought this was going to be another Will Smith blockbuster movie, but I'm still wondering what happened in the middle of shooting this film??  Was there a tiff between Smith and the director, or the direcor and the producer?  Who knows.  The first half hour of this film is typical Smith action movie.  You are reminded of movies like Independance Day and War of the Worlds right off the bat.  It's an empty city and Smith is the only survivor.  Can you imagine the possibilities for this film??

How the story presents itself is through flashbacks.  Smith is a Military Commander and he apparently is in charge of finding the cure for this deadly virus that instead of curing its patients, is practically killing them.  But that's not all of it though.  Apparently, some humans are not dying, but turning into bloodthirsty vampires who only live in the dark and have supernatural strength apparently.  Sounds crazy huh?  Well, the movie still deserves a chance despite that ridiculous premise.  I gave it a chance, but could only find myself counting the flaws and holes in the plot all throughout.  The issues I had with this film were certain holes that were in the story and certain things that were left out that were critical to making this a believable story.  It's hard to believe, but with a story so complex as this, this movie should have been over 2 hours.  It's not, it's well under and leaves a lot more to be desired.

The one scene that perplexes me is the scene with the mannequin that was placed as a trap.  Smith flips out that a mannequin that he saw at the video store was placed somewhere else in the city.  Now here's where it gets fishy.  Smith has acknowledged that the vampires have lost all human abilities, yet for some reason that trap was set up for him in front of that building.  I was asking myself, who set it up, the vampires or Smith himself?  And if he set it up himself, why would he forget about it and go crazy as a result?  The better answer was that the vampires weren't that primitive afterall, but intelligent and were setting the trap to catch Smith and eat him I guess.  My question is, why didn't they run with that story, why didn't they play the cat and mouse game after that?  Instead, the film takes the direction of Smith's paranoia and depression in a lonely world until miraculously 2 people come to New York to save him.  They briefly manage to get into an argument about God of all things (hidden message), and what results is a failed rescue attempt by 2 people who really wouldn't have the courage to drive all the way down there to find Smith in the first place.

The ending is quite abrupt and provides no closure to the story.  Aside from the first half of the movie and various special effects, this movie is a huge bust in my opinion.  This could have been a thriller movie as man versus monster, but the story is about man versus conscience and man versus duty that ultimately plays out as a dull narrative as how one man reacts to the isolation around him.

1603524,4,B00005JPTK,"i kind of figured that even for Will Smith being the primary and really only human character.  It might be hard for him to take on but that wasn't the case at all with I Am Legend.  As he plays a viriologist being the only survivor in the city he lives.  There are the ones infected by the virus that basically started because a doctor proclaimed to have a cure for cancer.  But that ""cure"" came at a very precious cost wiping out the majority of life all over the planet.

While the creatures that he encounters aren't especially frightening (will not after the first couple times at least).  It still manages to create a tension and excitement throughout the movie.  He has a German shepherd that his only real source of compassion and family as something terrible is revealed later on in the movie.

While not overly long, I Am Legend managed to keep me interested and watching.  Primarily because of Smith's character and the struggles he goes through with being the only person alive in the city.  He frequents a video store filled with mannequins and carries friendly conversations with me (which could be considered weird).  But i found it kind of quirky all while picking up the next video to watch that helps him pass the time.  The movie holds up throughout and while not as fast paced as the first hour,  i enjoyed the rest of the movie and an ending that leaves all kinds of possibilities for the future.

1603529,5,B00005JPTK,"I just finished watching the alternate version of I Am Legend. I have yet to see the theatrical version, and have had severe reticence in doing so. I am an avid fan of the original novel and felt through descriptions of friends who have seen the movie that this was so far from the novel, it should not have been given the same name. I heard slightly better things about the alternate version and have just learned otherwise. I am a fan of the movie, but the movie in its own right, as its own story, not in relation to the novel. I am also now eager to see the theatrical movie, and hope to find it as thoughtful and humane as the alternate version, because to me I Am Legend isn't just some zombie killing spree its a story with vivid imagination and inspiration to go outside the traditional lore of zombie-vampire creatures and enters you into a world of new-found deviation from traditional mythos. The alternate movie did, in its own right, have a similar feeling. If the theatrical version has a similar feeling with its different storyline, I will find myself to be entirely pleased with a trio of Legends to remember.

The 'hits' and 'misses' have already been stressed by so many people, but I've only seen in one review so far the perfect description for what the alternate version of the movie really succeeded at, even though it is almost entirely separated from the core plot lines of the original novel, it does such a great job of capturing the feeling. While fans of the novel will surely be disappointed if looking for a direct adaptation, and many newcomers to the story may be disappointed by the monsters themselves, the movie, through lead actor Will Smith, portrays such depth of feeling that one cannot fault it for its break from its predecessors. It just needs to be taken out of context of the original, watch it as if it was a brand new story. Then, if you haven't, read the book. It is a story to remember.",1208390400,,1935,4.497159090909091

Smith had the almost the first half of the entire movie focused on him. No one to talk to except a dog. He does an amazing job of engaging the audience. The relationship with the dog was great. The dog deserved the academy award. The death of the dog scene was truly horrifying.

The main problem with the movie was that the ending was rushed. Once the dog died, the movie quickly jumped to the final act. As if the director knew where he wanted to go, but did not know how to get there. Another problem is that the zombies were poorly done.

1603586,4,B00005JPTK,"I've been a fan of Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend' for many years.  It's not a story that fits with popular film canons, it REALLY isn't. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, but suffice it to say, the novelty of the ending works great on the page, but would probably have people storming the box office to get their money back as a film.

But every so often, seemingly about every 20 years, it gets made into a movie, anyway.

So what can you take from the book that WORKS?  The desolation of a lone survivor in a great empty city.. the eerie beauty of that kindof place and what that life would be.

For this viewer this film nailed it.  No, it's not a slugfest, an action-packed thrillride.. No, Will Smith is not chewing a cigar and firing off one-liners to no-one for 2 hours (thank goodness- one can only imagine how this film would have played like with Arnold Schwarzeneggar, the original choice for the lead).

So, what it IS is a stoic, QUIET observation of one person and a dog against a vividly empty Manhattan.  I say vividly because the CGI erasure of people used in this film is one the nicest understated effects I've seen used in a sci-fi film in many a year.

The vampires of the original story have been given a reasonable (if predictable) update, and CGI is used extensively to give them a jumpy, feral quality.  If CGI makes them less believable, it at least succeeds in making them very unhuman, and the de-evolution aspect of these creatures makes this vision more isolating (and genuinely sad) than perhaps it should be.

Will Smith knocked me out in this film.  It's nothing more than a meditation on remaining hopeful and holding together, and he evokes a big range of emotion with hardly a word.  No higher praise.

As a sci-fi enthusiast, I'd give it 5 stars, but there's no way to resolve the ending of this story.  The original ending is an ironic slap in the face to the reader, the Omega Man nails Heston/Jesus to a cross, and this film tries to find a hopeful middle ground, but it just doesn't satisfy... to their credit they had an alternate ending that gives the story a stronger humanist slant, and it's interesting, but even less satisfying than the one they chose to use.

**EDIT** (I take my last comment back------I have since seen the blu-ray release with the alternate ending intact and feel it's a much better film, a better character study, and a better resolution.. though it raises more questions about Neville's motives for finding a cure that fall outside of the simple hero story)

So, yes, it flops in the last 3 minutes, but it's the journey thru that stark beautiful city that you hope we don't live to see that makes it worth it.",1208304000,7,2690,4.490759753593429

 A scientist, Robert Neville (Will Smith) is living with his trusty dog Sam in the new and deserted jungle New York. There was an epidemic and everyone who had ""Clear eyes"" or ""Good eyes"" was sent out of New York. Neville's wife and daughter were killed in a helicopter on their way out of New York. Sadly almost nobody made it through the travel. In New York Robert Neville lives an everyday life. He goes to the movie shop and gets and returns movies, he lives in his house, eats food and works out. He also hunts the prey running around, like the gazelle. A thing that isn't an ordinary thing that he does is he captures these sick humans that have turned into mutant creatures. He does this so he can try to find a cure for them. The way he captures them is by spilling blood onto a blanket and sets up a trap. He uses blood because the creatures are attracted to blood. He knocks them out cold and then takes the creatures to his house, into his basement and ties them down onto a stretcher. He gives a vaccine of some sort. Then they go wild.
Many creatures have died while Dr. Neville tries to find a cure. As the Robert was driving around one day he sees his friend from the movie store ""Fred"", the manikin. Neville walks towards the manikin. He thinks the manikin is one of the mutant creature so he shoots at him with his gun. The manikin just shatters. As he gets closer he is swung up in the air by a rope and the taxi car near the side of the rode drops off the side of the road. It was a trap. He's knocked out and his dog Sam is barking at him. As it gets closer to dark he awakens and sees the creatures there inside the building about 10-15 yards away.
He cuts the rope holding him up but stabs himself on the way down. The creatures have mutant dogs that are waiting for the sun to be blocked. They have to wait because the sun kills them and that's why they live in dark places. Sam protects her owner but she is badly wounded. Neville tries to kill himself but is saved by a woman named Anna and a boy named Ethan. The next morning when he woke up the place he stab himself was stitched up. The next night the manikins followed the scent of his blood and a whole army of manikins come towards the house. Will blows up part of them and saves Ethan and Anna. They head down towards the basement to hide. Mutant Creatures soon appear and.......

It has remained one of my favorite apocalyptic films, with some pretty wry humor thrown in. When my wife and I went to see this film over Christmas break at the show, I had high hopes, and I was entranced until the final 30 minutes of the film, and then I was what????

The movie spent such a long time effectively building sympathy for the protagonist, and then threw it all away by rushing the end. And without giving away the end, the alternative conclusion available on the disk 2 versions, while maybe a bit hokey, was much more satisfying and enjoyable.

So my advice is if you are going to buy Legend, get this Two disk special edition",1208131200,2,728,4.425373134328358
1603628,3,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend showed a lot of promise through the trailers and plot synopses, but I thought failed to deliver the expected product. Will Smith delivered a strong performance and was the star of this film in more ways than the obvious, momentarily allowing the viewer to overlook the rushed storyline (primarily in the second half), confusing message, cliche tear-jerkers, and yawn-inspiring reliance on computer animation.

While the first 30 minutes or so developed nicely and showed promise for the rest of the film, the remainder seemed rushed and under-developed. If this was an intentional directing style designed to reflect the developing insanity and instability of Smith's character, I highly commend the director. Unfortunately nothing else in the movie would lead me to believe that this could be true.

It seemed for a while that the movie was working toward some focused moral or comment on human nature, but the result was muddled, and seemed to lose its integrity in lieu of CGE (computer-generated entertainment) so that the viewer can't quite tell what the director's vision actually was. Anticipating a departure from the modern blockbuster of this nature, I was disappointed.

Without going into details (trying to avoid ""spoilers"" here), you can expect to see every nearly every imaginable cliche cinematic tear-jerker, which work with varying success. However, the viewer is ultimately left either excessively distressed or excessively irritated, and in both cases asking whether they were really necessary.

The CG creatures were another point of contention for me. Although I realize the symbolism between CG bodies and the idea that the creatures have been left completely devoid of human nature, I couldn't help but get flashbacks from ""I, Robot"" (Will Smith can never work with CG humanoids again). Those looking for a frightening zombie movie will probably be disappointed by those Smith actually encounters.

Overall the film is worth watching once, but don't expect something much different than a post-1995 computer-generated blockbuster.",1208131200,2,2066,5.38390092879257

1603681,5,B00005JPTK,"I thoroughly enjoyed Will's acting in this movie because he conveyed the fear so much through his eyes. He showed a tiny hint of this in Enemy of the State, but it really shone as an overriding emotion that the Neville character had to overcome. Also, I was impressed with his slip from humanity after the loss he suffered in the middle of the movie. The descent in maddening isolation in the video store scene was excellent characterization.

This was the first time I was nervous watching a movie. I kept waiting for the jump scenes to happen, and I would tighten every muscle like I was going down the first steep drop of a roller coaster ride. It was an awesome.

I know people found the infected people cheesy, but that is because they were misled into thinking that they were supposed to be zombies. This is not Night of the Living Dead or even 28 (Days/Weeks) Later. The infected had become a super race, a no body fat, all muscle, dark-loving, voracious race. They were driven to consume by their super-fast metabolism. (Not necessarily the way I would like to lose weight.)

In my opinon, the theatrical release was in every way better than the alternative ending. It was more logical and truer to the storyline. I found that the alternative melted into a Disney happy-ending for all involved that erased the first hour and a half. What were they thinking?? It just did not make any sense to make the man-eating super race look like they were misunderstood. For all that, a dream sequence would have been more acceptable.

I would definitely recommend this movie. Thanks to all involved.",1207958400,2,1596,4.648936170212766
1603682,3,B00005JPTK,"With all of the adjustments to the original story incorporated by the screenwriters, maybe the title should have been changed with this rendition just as it was with two earlier movie versions. My choice would be ""He was Legend"" based on the ending of the theatrical version. In the book the title highlights the irony of Neville's existence and demise, here it makes little sense.

On individual merit, this version is worthwhile, bordering on above average in the genre of horror/zombie films, although in the original works the creatures pursuing - or alternatively pursued by - Robert Neville were vampires, and the movie's arguably cathartic, placebo of a conclusion is uninspired.  My difficulty is compartmentalizing the film and the book because knowledge of the source material rendered the film somewhat disappointing. While a few of the liberties or adaptations infused by the screenwriters are largely cosmetic, some can be attributed to the eras of the media as the novella was published in 1954. I did not find the change in locale from Los Angeles to NYC to be detracting even though it seemed to be a vehicle to substantiate an ""Escape from New York"" themed back story that is non-existent in the book. Altering the significance of the dog was a tender touch however I thought the role of the dog in the book conveyed Neville's conflicting senses of isolation and optimism much more effectively.  The introduction of the woman and the child to the movie, while in all likelihood unavoidable to tie this story together, unfortunately, resulted in a near complete loss of focus and direction.

The adjustment in his occupation and experience may have been necessary within the constraints of film however Matheson's depiction of Neville as an average man forced by the vagaries of chance to carve out his daily existence was engrossing. Here, Will Smith's character is a physically fit, militarily trained scientist doing only what he knows best, continuing the research he started before the infection overran humankind.  The panoramic views of sites in and around Manhattan were an homage to the cinematographer and the CGI effects may have some enticing effect for some viewers but they could have easily have used those opportunities demonstrate why Neville became legend in the original story.

I don't want to meander into the realm of spoiler, but there is a dichotomy in the book that fails to be addressed by the film.  One vehicle addresses competitive interests and survival while the other offers an idealized view of moral and ethical choice. Personally, the dystopian view holds more appeal for me.",1207872000,2,2626,5.064814814814815
1603683,5,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith stars as scientist Robert Neville in this apocalyptic thriller about viruses and the struggle to survive.

Dr. Neville is a military scientist charged with finding a cure for a terrible virus that has supposedly sprung from a failed cure for cancer.  The virus has a 90% kill rate, and the military is moving to evacuate people from New York City.  Neville rushes his wife and daughter to a waiting helicopter, but he remains in the city; determined to find a cure for the rabid disease.  Neville himself is immune from the virus, but most are not.  To make matters worse, the military has decided to quarantine Manhattan, and soon, bridges are being blasted to prevent infected people from escaping.  Neville only has Sam, his pet German Shepard, as a companion.

Neville spends his days foraging and his nights working on a cure for the virus, using his own immune blood as a component to the vaccine.  He is also forced to deal with the Infected; mutated vampire-like zombies who are roaming the deserted streets of New York in search of prey.  He has also sent out radio messages trying to attract other immune people to come and join him.  He offers food, shelter, and safety to any immune person who can reach him.

One encounter with the Infected leaves Sam near death.  Neville takes his beloved dog home to try to save him, but Sam begins exhibiting traits like the Infected.  Sadly, Neville puts Sam down himself.  However, he isn't alone for long, as a young woman and child show up unexpectedly at his house.  She explains that God brought her to Robert's house, but he is skeptical.  Meanwhile, Robert has been experimenting on one of the Infected that he managed to capture and bring back to his house.  By using his own blood, it appears that the effects of the virus are being reversed, but it might be too late for Robert and his companions, as the other Infected have tracked Robert to his home.  Soon, the others break into the house and begin searching for Robert.  Will he survive, or will the Infected succeed in disposing of him?

This is a first-rate thriller.  Will Smith gives one of his best performances since ""Independence Day"" as the dedicated Dr. Neville.  The special effects are excellent as well.  It was somewhat scary looking at a deserted New York City, with weeds growing in the cracks of sidewalks and streets.  Watching lions hunt deer in the city was definitely strange, too.

I rate this movie very highly.  The story is very good, and the acting and special effects will keep the viewer interested until the end.  Watch ""I Am Legend"" and experience what it might be like to be the last person on Earth.",1207872000,3,2656,4.655913978494624

1603685,4,B00005JPTK,"I love I am Legend, the book.  Richard Matheson's portrayal of loneliness, isolation, and eventual insanity and redemption was always one of my favorite books.

The original movie, The Last Man on Earth, was good and came fairly close.  The Omega Man, the second try, was more of a campy affair, but it's one of my favorite movies.

This one has got to be one of the most faithfull to the core of the book.  Will Smith, in a very poignant performance, captures the core of what the book was about.  This is a very hard movie to carry, even for a star of his caliber, because for most of the movie, he's by himself.

I loved it, from the empty spaces of Manhattan to the wandering animals in the streets, it's eerily portrayed as the aftermath a plague and it works well.  The direction isn't frenetic, characterization is great.  The only complain I had was the creatures.  They look too computer generated.  Minor complaint for an otherwise great movie.

See it, if you haven't seen it already.  The blu-ray version has excellent color definition and the sound punches the experience up greatly.

1603686,2,B00005JPTK,"Overall, the main flaw of this movie was in it's story and execution, which is quite possibly the biggest thing in a movie.

I was impressed cinematically--sweeping landscapes, great use of CGI and special effects, editing and camera angles. But, a movie needs more than that to be worth anything.

I went in expecting a zombie movie (which is partly the fault of the movie execs and how they advertised the movie), and what I got was a half-drama, half-suspense film that was too long for what it was trying to say. Too many scenes with Smith worrying about himbeing the last man on earth. Where Smith usually shines, in his predictable hero-esque roles, he fails here--as a scientist who experiment goes wrong. His acting suits the story, but not the desperation or fear a man in his place may have. The best scene in the movie, and the one that may have been Smith's best acting in the role, involved him and his dog and a fod hunt gone wrong. However, the movie turns or the worse when he realises he may not be the only person still alive. However, by this time in the move, the audience is a little tired, to say the least, and I;m not sure anyone cares if he makes it out alive.

I was disappointed that the movie had no elements of suspense, sans the dog hunt scene, and I left the theatre wondering if I had seen the right movie.

Another gripe was the length. The story was too drawn out, and one has to reason if the writers really had a story to begin with (yes, I know it was a remake, but the other ones were definately better, and had some story to work with).

Essentially, I was caught between figuring out the genre of the movie (drama or suspense or zombie thriller) and wondering when the hell it was going to end.",1207699200,,1734,4.356037151702786
1603687,4,B00005JPTK,"""I Am Legend"" is one of the few movies I saw at the theater in 2007 (I have 2 kids, one of which is an infant, so it's hard for me to get to the theater these days). I usually only go see a film at the theater if I am VERY interested in it. Other than that, I wait for the DVD release.

For me, paying to see this at the theater was WELL worth the money. I have not read the original book (but I plan to now that I've seen the film), so I really can't say how accurately the original story is portrayed. Regardless, I was RIVETED. I found the story to be very intriguing, suspenseful, sad, heart-warming, and downright nerve-wracking.

What really held my attention, though, was Will Smith's performance. He has definitely come a long way since his ""Fresh Prince"" days. This man can carry a role like a champion (I also recommend his peformance in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" - it was Oscar-worthy). His performance took me in and made me sympathize with the character as if he were my best friend. >>>SPOILER ALERT<<< When he ended up having to kill his beloved pet, I was almost in tears. You could feel Neville's anguish and pain beneath his determination to find a cure.

Most of the detractors to this film seem to site the poor CGI effects that depicted the infected as being a major downfall of the movie. Yes, I've seen better, but this did not distract me or diminish my enjoyment of the film. From what I understand, the director originally had actors in make up and costumes to portray the infected, but it just didn't work and was not very convincing, so they decided to switch to CGI. Perhaps they were forced to do a ""rush job"" which resulted in subpar creature effects. Just my two cents' worth.

As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are both very good, but the extras that are offered really aren't all that much to rave about. There are a few ""animated comics"" that take place in other parts of the world that have to do with the virus infection, but are unrelated to Neville's story. These comics are well-done and stylish, but they aren't very long. There really could have been more special features offered. A ""making of"" short would have been nice, but instead, you can download a digital copy of the film. Big woop.

This particular release also comes with an alternate ending not shown in theaters. In my personal opinion, the original theatrical ending was better. Again, just my two cents'.

All in all, ""I Am Legend"" was an excellent film worthy of adding to your home video library.",1207612800,,2525,4.454545454545454

Visually, this movie is quite impressive. I've never actually been to Manhattan, but seeing the wildlife roam the streets littered with abandoned vehicles and plantlife, made me feel as if I had.

I had a couple of minor issues; one with the plot that I cannot mention without being a slight ""spoiler"" and the other with the rather abrupt ending, in my opinion.

This certainly didn't really distract from the overall experience & once again, Will Smith was wonderful mixing drama with his brand of comedy in precisely the right places.",1207612800,,732,4.703125

1603719,4,B00005JPTK,"I saw this movie in theaters and then purchased the DVD.  It is quite an impressive work.  Fans of Matheson's original book will definitely enjoy the haunting depiction of New York City following the disappearance of humans altogether.  The first part of the plot is very intense and, at times, can be downright scary, even when the ""dark seekers"" are not present.

Many people have stated that they did not like the ending, something to which I must agree.  The film loses its momentum towards the end.  I bought the 2-disc version just to get the alternate ending in case something ""better"" was available, but did not think the alternative was much better.  All-in-all, the writers could have done a much better job in incorporating the final sequences to the middle of the story.  But, that can be hard at times when the writers don't get to interact with the directors.

Despite that, I still think it is a worthy film to watch.  I would much rather be writing a review for a decent film like this than some pointless, shoot-em-up Michael Bay flick.  Most people will likely enjoy ""I Am Legend"", the first part at the very least.",1207526400,,1133,4.64321608040201
1603720,4,B00005JPTK,"Director Francis Lawrence deserves a standing ovation for portraying such haunting images of a deserted Manhattan, its streets and thoroughfares overgrown with weeds and teaming with wild life.  A desolate Times Square long silenced into decay and deterioration has real impact on the viewer.  These images, combined with an exceptional performance by Will Smith, make I AM LEGEND a haunting, yet ultimately satisfying, experience.

Smith, with the help of a German Shepherd, aptly carries this movie by himself.  I've seen this actor in numerous films, and in my opinion he's never been better.  The viewer shares Smith's range of emotions--from his determination to eradicate a deadly virus that has decimated the human population, to his fear and terror of the mutated zombies who survived the infection, to his grief over the loss of his family. . .to his utter loneliness and despair.  Intermingled with flashbacks depicting the once-promising virus (a cure for cancer) unleashed in New York, Lawrence and Smith convey a story that systematically builds tension and delivers suspense right to its tragic end.

My biggest complaint (and it didn't take away from my enjoyment of this film) had to do with the cartoonish appearance of the zombies.  Bald, charcoal-colored, hairless, shirtless, these monsters with super-human strength and athleticism looked like they belonged in a video game, not a motion picture.  One can only wonder how much more real and convincing this story would have been had real actors been used. . .

Regarding the special features of this two-disc set, the first disc includes four animated short features depicting other survivors coping with loneliness and/or despair in other parts of the world--and all four include some very disturbing images.  The second disc is another version of the entire film, featuring what is dubbed a ""controversial ending.""  Having viewed it, I am so glad the theatrical release ended the way it did, as the alternate ending was over the top--way too much of a ""feel good"" ending, and not in keeping with the post-apocalyptic theme of the story.  And for a plethora of extra features and segments the viewer is advised to insert Disc #2 into his/her PC and go online--something that is above and beyond the call of duty of at least this couch potato.  Setting these drawbacks aside, I AM LEGEND is recommended viewing, a haunting story of loneliness, tension, and heart-pounding suspense.

1603722,2,B00005JPTK,"Since the mid 90s Hollywood has really been in a rut; everything has to be bigger and louder and basic storytelling has gone out the window. But I'm not gonna totally knock Hollywood they do sometimes get it right. It's just they don't produce the movies they once did. I hoped I Am Legend would be one of the few that worked well, but when all was said and done Hollywood dropped the ball again. I Am Legend had potential to be a really chilling movie, but it never reaches that level.

First up I have to mention Will Smith who plays Robert Neville; it's pretty much a one man show and more than half the movie is just Will Smith and his dog. I'll give major credit to Smith who really does a great job at carrying the movie. In general the movies Will Smith does really don't appeal to me, but he is a fantastic actor and does one hell of a job here.

I Am Legend is based off the Richard Matheson novel and the screenplay was written by Mark Protosevich & Akiva Goldsman and it's never really interesting. It's not easy to write a screenplay and even harder when you have pretty much one character through a majority of the movie. The concept of the movie is excellent, but their screenplay just doesn't really work. It's not terrible by any means, just isn't all that good. But with the right director it could have possibly worked.

Francis Lawrence steps into the director's chair and fails at brining any tension or adventure. The pacing often lacks and he never really gets much going and the action scenes come out weak. Seeing the deserted Manhattan streets is sort creepy as a New Yorker and seeing that makes for a semi chilling moment, but is never as creepy as it could have been. But after a while those shots become tiresome. I never felt that whole end of the world vibe; one of the most chilling scenes in recent memory was the deserted London streets in 28 Days Later, but here with I Am Legend you never get that chilling vibe.

The screenplay was flawed, but with the right director I think the movie could have worked. I just never felt any tension, the deserted Manhattan streets are never as chilling as it should have been and the action scenes fail at brining much excitement. The ending was very anti-climatic. What could have been a powerful scene feels rushed and just falls flat.

The biggest downfall of the movie is the CGI; first off I really don't like CGI, but depending on the movie I can tolerate it. With a 150-million dollar budget one would think the F/X would come out good, but nope it's terrible and really brings the movie down. I've seen movies done on a much lower budget that ranges from 2-5-million with CGI and it looks on par with this. I've seen movies done under a million that have far better F/X. With the budget I Am Legend had there is no excuse for such shoddy F/X.

I Am Legend is just too Hollywood stylized; in some ways it's better than a lot of what's out there. While this does have action scenes it's not done as much as I thought it would be. I expected mindless action scene over and over again and it wasn't. So that's a good thing, but action or not it's too stylized. A movie like this needs more of a gritty look. Again there was potential here, but when all is said and done I Am Legend just lacks in tension and excitement.

If you are into big time Hollywood productions odds are I Am Legend will get the job done and you'll enjoy the movie, but for the rest of us we'll mostly be bored. I haven't seen The Omega Man, which is based off the Matheson novel and I Am Legend follows that movie, but I have seen The Last Man on Earth, which is also based off the Matheson novel. My opinion skip this one and check out The Last Man on Earth, while flawed it's far better than this.

When the initial posters for ""I Am Legend"" arrived in theaters and listed the name Will Smith I was already psyched to see it, even though based on the posters I thought the name was the way too long ""The Last Man on Earth is Not Alone"", but it turned out that was just the tagline, but I still maintain that was a strange marketing strategy by not making the film's title readily visible. Anyways, when the trailers began showing up on the internet and on television I became even more pumped for the movie because it just looked really interesting and cool, and I was intrigued by the fact that based on the previews I still had no clue what exactly Will's character was up against, only that he was the last surviving member of humanity (to his knowledge) and he's fighting for survival against some monstrous person or group of people. So, the movie was released to theaters, I didn't go see it, go figure since I don't see a whole lot of films at the theaters these days, partly because of time and the other is the ever-increasing cost of ticket prices, I just find it easier to wait the extra few months for the DVD release and watch it on my widescreen TV in the comfort of my own home. Finally, it was released to DVD, and after all the various criticisms I had heard, along with some praise, though it seemed like not as many people liked the movie compared to those that disliked it to some degree or just flat-out hated it; I was still interested in seeing the movie and I must say I was not disappointed in the least.

""I Am Legend"" takes place in the year 2012, as mankind has been essentially wiped out by a deadly virus meant to cure cancer. In place of mankind are these monstrous, mutated beings who are similar to vampires due to their affinity for darkness, sensitivity to light, their attraction to blood, and because they can infect others with their `vampirism' as it were; however, they are not vampires or even zombies for that matter, they are merely mutated and diseased humans who have taken over New York City and possibly the rest of the world. At night they are in charge, but during the day one lone man prowls the streets, Robert Neville (Will Smith) who along with his trusty German Shepherd, Sam, has NYC all to themselves. Robert is a former military virologist who is trying desperately to develop a cure for the disease that he is somehow immune to, while at the same time trying to keep his sanity and hold onto some small sliver of hope that there may possibly be other human survivors out there waiting to be found.

After watching ""I Am Legend"" I can see why some people may have not liked the movie as much as most of Will Smith's previous efforts, because prior to its release no one really knew what to expect from the movie. So, the fact that essentially 85% percent of the movie consists of either Will Smith on screen by himself or with his dog, and no one else to really interact with, could really turn some people off to the overall experience of the movie. In my case, I knew what to expect going into watching the movie, so Will Smith having to act by himself on screen a majority of the time didn't bother me at all, and I was truly impressed by how good he did and just how captivating he made the character of Robert. I believe that even if I hadn't known what to expect in terms of whether there would be other actors featured prominently or just having Will by himself for a majority of the film, I still would have enjoyed the movie all the same.

The story for ""I Am Legend"" is very well-paced and well-written by screenwriters Mark Protosevich (""Poseidon"") and Akiva Goldsman (""I, Robot"") based on a novel by Richard Matheson. They imbue the story with such heart, intense drama, and a tense, eerie atmosphere that you are instantly drawn into the plight of this lone man roaming the streets searching for a way to survive and to fix past mistakes, and in the end cure the disease that has ravaged the world. I appreciated the way the writers tried to show Robert's mental state as being somewhat disconnected from reality, by having him set up mannequins throughout the city for him to interact with as if they were real people. Also, the connection between Robert and his dog Sam was very genuine and natural, serving as an almost bittersweet connection to Robert's past and the family that he's lost along the way. Many people praised Will Smith for his powerful performance in this movie given the challenge of having to act by himself, and he is completely deserving of any praise he receives for his work here, but by the same token, I would think some praise should go to the writers for being able to craft such an engaging story focusing on one man and his dog, without really being able to rely on dialogue or any kind of interaction with other characters. This is a brilliant job on behalf of the writers and even the novelist, for being able to keep an audiences' attention every step of the way without the usual tools at their disposal for propelling a story onward.

From an acting standpoint, there is really only one person to talk about and that's Will Smith, and as I've alluded to somewhat already he did an exemplary job with the role of Robert Neville. Will is a magnetic presence onscreen in every movie I've seen him in, but normally he's able to play off of other actors in the scene, but here he's pretty much on his own or with a dog, aside from a few key flashbacks that shed some light on his previous life before the virus struck, so his ability is definitely worthy of praise. An incredible performance for Will, and one that I'm sure wasn't nearly as easy as some of his other past performances might have been, but he handled the isolation onscreen very well, and conveyed the characters deep sense of loss in a way that was very natural yet didn't make the character seem suicidal or depressed, which would have most likely not played well with most audiences, just desperate which was very appropriate for the circumstances Robert has found himself in.

""I Am Legend"" is a very entertaining movie that remains engaging from start to finish even though the focus is primarily on Will Smith and his dog, and not much else. Director Francis Lawrence (""Constantine"") has really knocked it out of the park with this movie; he's definitely come along way from shooting music videos for MTV. Some have likened this movie to Tom Hanks' survivalist film ""Castaway"" due to his character being alone on an island except for a volleyball named Wilson as a companion. I can see the similarity between the two movies in that both movies featured a lead actor who was forced to act by himself for a majority of the film, but that's pretty much where the similarities end. Unlike ""Castaway"" which was a good movie, but not great, I feel ""I Am Legend"" is a great movie and one I will watch more than once. This movie isn't for everybody, but if you kind of know what you're going into prior to seeing the movie, you may end up enjoying it more, no guarantees though.

""I Am Legend"" is rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images.",1207353600,,7336,4.4790732436472345
1603724,2,B00005JPTK,"I absolutely loved the movie.  I believe it is Will Smith's best role since ""Ali"" and shows that he has some serious acting talent, as he holds his own in the first 2/3rds of the movie as the only screen presence for the film (minus flashbacks) opposite only a dog as his only companion and friend.

I thought it was phenomenally shot, and genuinely the scariest movie I've ever seen in my adult life.  Nothing I'd seen until then was genuinely frightening (and not just a cheap teen horror thrill with a loud sound and/or violin shriek) when Sam (Neville's dog) rushes after a deer into a pitch dark area, with only a gun-mounted flashlight, and absolutely no music playing whatsoever.

Followed by another genuinely frightening scene, in which Fred (one of the mannequins Neville sets up outside a video store to talk to) has been moved (as part of a Darkseeker's trap), and nearly drives Neville insane, thinking Fred is perhaps a real person, and having to shoot him to be sure, only to spring the trap.

As great as the movie was, and as frightening as it was, and as heartbreaking as it was to see the fate of his family and his dog, I spend about 18 dollars for the special edition two-disc version.

And I spend double the price for the single disc for... maybe five minutes extra footage, tops?

Disc one is basically the same thing you'd get in the normal edition; movie plus four animated comics.  Disc two gives you THE SAME MOVIE with maybe five minutes additional footage, such as some minor deleted scenes setting up the premise for the Darkseeker's evolution and intelligence, and the alternate ending, which while was a bit frightening and touching at once, was hardly groundbreaking and not at all controversial.

Spoiler Alert: The ""alternate"" version of the movie just has a butterfly reference (the Darkseeker girl's tattoo), a scene with Neville showing Anna and Ethan the trap the Darkseeker Alpha set for him, a scene with Ethan swimming in a fish pond while Anna asks about the Darkseeker's evolution, and the alternate ending, in which rather than sacrifice himself, Neville turns over the girl to the Darkseeker, who shows he can truly love, and the Darkseekers leave them be to escape, with a cure to the virus in hand.

So for used on Amazon you get the single disc version for.. 8 dollars or so.  For used two-disc, you get for 14 (as of this date), and before that I paid 18 including shipping.

So as with the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix special edition, I got screwed; we all got screwed.

Worthless.  Try again next time, Warner Brothers.",1207353600,3,2586,4.654945054945055
1603725,2,B00005JPTK,"Just like my title states, I felt as if they hurried this movie and so the CGI suffered. The zombie/mummy/whatever-they're-called were very cartoonish. GREAT concept and story, but not a good film. I also felt as if Will Smith's acting wasn't his best. It almost seems as if his mind was elsewhere. If they had spent more time on this film (particularly the CGI), it would have been one of the decade's best. I think I'll wait for the remake so that they can get their CGI to where it looks better than a Disney/Pixar movie.

The theatrical version of the film is greatly marred by a jarringly trite Hollywood-style ending that is completely out of step with the rest of the film. Fortunately, the Blu-Ray disk includes an Alternative version with a far superior ending  (and one that is considerably more faithful to the spirit of Matheson's novel). Because the alternative ending builds on plot elements from earlier in the film, I can only imagine that it was the original ending, but that somebody lost their nerve.",1207353600,,716,5.016806722689076

1603789,2,B00005JPTK,"I greatly enjoyed Will Smith's acting in this movie.  He is a top-notch actor to begin with, and he turned in a fine performance.

Yet the special effects seem a bit warmed over.  Had I not seen the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I may have enjoyed them, but it seems Gollum from the movie adaptation of Tolkien's opus has been cloned and rewarmed.  Perhaps they did this to save money, having blown more of the budget on the top-notch title character, Will Smith.

Of course if this is the case, I have to say I generally applaud the choice of a good actor/actress over whizz-bang SFX's.

Mostly, I chafe under the tone of despair that this movie cast.  It is difficult or impossible to adequately discuss my problems with this movie without spoiling it, so in respect for movie viewers, I conclude this point here by merely saying that I flat-out DO NOT RECOMMEND this movie.  (Despite Smith's believability, depth of character, and ability to get us to care about his character.)

1603790,5,B00005JPTK,This movie was way better than I thought it would be. Will Smith put on some great acting in this film.  Portraying the psyche of the last man on earth he did a great job.  Trying to keep a routine to keep himself sane.  Still holding out hope that there are people out there by going to the dock everyday and broadcasting a message over the air.  The movie really paid attention to detail.  The second storyline about his family fit too and even the darkstalkers were portrayed well.

The special effects were good but this was just a horrible, long (only 1hr 40min, but seemed like many more) and plodding film that went nowhere.

And to boot, they have to kill his dog near the middle of the film making it depressing as well as boring?!!?

I liked the original ending far better then the alternate one, although both endings had a hard time trying to make something out of this boring and predictable nothing of a movie.

Could have been a great one with Smith and the very interesting premise behind the Movie, yet it turned in to a dud that goes in the 'Watch Once, But Never Again' bin.

I wish I could give it zero stars for the sole reason they killed the dog. There was no reason behind having Smith have to Kill his only companion....served no purpose other then to make it depressing as well as boring and had they kept the dog alive, perhaps his antics could have gotten this to maybe 2 or 3 stars as there would have been many areas they could have used the dog...

I enjoyed the special effects and computer animations as well as the staging of this very good sci-fi remake of the OMEGA MAN.  In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit more than the original film and recommend it for all fans of Will Smith.

I was not at all surprised that Will Smith could pull off some very serious and dramatic acting under genuine ""sci-fi"" conditions that strain credulity. As I always suspected, he is much more than a likeable stunt man and should enjoy a great acting career over the years ahead.

The ending of the film was a bit of a bummer, but we all knew the basic plot anyhow. I thought he went out like an action figure but was given a good chance to demonstrate his very fine acting skills.  As he usually does, he portrayed a very likeable and basically very good individual, and did this without appearing corny. His character was trying to set straight a failure of the entire human race and took his responsibilities as a research doctor very personally.",1207180800,,1044,4.445026178010472

The best part is the alternate ending version, which really only affects Chapters 25-28.  In my opinion, the alternate ending provided for a much more ""complete"" movie, and touches on issues and themes only hinted at in the theatrical release.  Without giving too much away, I have to say that despite what Hollywood execs think, you owe it to yourself if you're a true sci-fi fan to watch the alternate ending.

1603848,3,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend by Richard Matheson has to be one of the most frightening books ever written in the 1950's. But it seems all of the theatrical renditions of this movie have not hit the point of it's clever title. In ""The Last Man on Earth,"" ""The Omega Man,"" and the recent ""I Am Legend,"" all Neville characters are portrayed to be legends of men- the Last man ever to live on Earth.

However, the book's true meaning has been warped in all three motion pictures,(though I have to say ""The Omega Man"" is, sorta, the closest). The novel's Robert Neville is not a legend among men, but among Vampires. As the crowd of vampires look fearfully up at him as he is about to be executed, the author describes that Neville was really like a vampire to them- Coming during their resting hour to slaughter them during their sleep, just as a vampire would a man. See the connection?

Over all, if I had not read the book afterward, 2007's ""I Am Legend"" was entertaining, suspensful, and, I'll admit, a bit frightening. But I'm afraid that too many people would not have understood the real meaning of the film had it been made directly according to the book. Maybe that's why.",1206921600,6,1160,4.466981132075472

I totally understand people being disgruntled with the film not being true to the book, but they rarely do. Sometimes books don't lend themselves well to theater.. whatever.

Watching at Home:
I have a home theater system and the surround sound effects were something else, I was drawn in and was able to keep the volume at THX reference level during the entire film. Great sound, great effects and Will Smith was quite good. I hate to admit it, but I jumped a few times during the movie and I can't remember the last time a movie actually made me jump.  Though I gave it 4 stars, I think this is a 3.5 star movie. It doesn't fall into the realm of Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan or Lawrence of Arabia among other greats.  It was good movie, but not a great movie.

  Special Features suck, though: Most people probably wouldn't care, but I myself am big on commentaries and enjoy watching them, (and to my dismay) this doesn't have one, NOT ONE, no director commentaries, no cast commentaries (one with Will Smith ""Dr. Neville"" himself would've been AWESOME), and not even one with a damn photographer, NONE!

  Also for Special features: No matter what edition you BUY, all include 4 boring, 3 minute animated shorts that have NOTHING AT ALL to do with the movie (I honestly don't know why they're there). If you BUY the 2-disc special edition with digital copy (what i own) you get a DVD specifically designed for a Windows XP or higher to import the Movie into your computer so you can get a digital copy of sorts, and it also includes a 2nd disc with the alternate ""controversial"" ending. I don't know what's so ""controversial"" about it and also, I don't think it's all that great (I prefer the the featured one over the alternate).

OVERALL:: BUY THIS TODAY, IT'S WORTH THE MONEY!

Also, just because it's pg-13 doesnt mean it's not scary as hell, it's not as gory as say resident Evil or Dawn of the Dead, but it will jump you numerous times because there is no music to build up suspense. things just jump out.

This film chose to ignore nuances of the story line that would have allowed viewers to connect with these characters on a more personal level.  While the latest graphic technologies allowed for scarier representations of the mutants, it does not make up for the missing depth that would have been provided by increased character development of the mutants, and the surviving scientist.  My personal favorite film version of this story is ""Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston released in 1971.  There is also ""The Last Man On Earth""  with Vincent Price released in 1964.

1603853,3,B00005JPTK,"I AM LEGEND could have been a classic film.
But it fell flat.... a terrible loss of potential.

First the good....
1) The scenery work making New York look like a wasteland deserves an oscar. Very well done.

2) Will Smith has matured into a very good actor and did well in this film.

3) The film borrowed heavily from the Vincent Price film version of this sci-fi classic which is a good thing.

Now the BAD..........

1) CGI ""dark seekers"".
Hollywood needs to put away the ""gee-whiz"" gimmickery and sometimes focus on real film making again.
These cartoon-looking ""monsters"" looked so goofy and like the Zombies in the old SEGA video game ""House of the Dead"" that any feeling of dread and gloom that were established by the great scenery was lost.

CGI is still not to the level technologically where it can be used for humans or characters meant to strike a chord of reality or feeling.
That's what killed the HULK, recent remake of KING KONG and some other recent films.

You simply can't connect or feel ""what I am seeing is real"" when they are visually divorced from reality.

Smith's other film ""I-ROBOT"" suffered that same problem.

2) SPOILER ALERT -
...
...
....
....
....
...
When Sam, the dog dies...... so does the apparent pacing of the movie.
Others have had the same comment on here.... It seems the 2nd half of the movie pales in comparison to the first.

The plot device used to get rid of Sam, was too contrived.
ie.... Smith's character get's snared in a trap.
Then awakens just at sunset.
When he gets down... you ask yourself ............... Okay Buddy why don't you hop on your one good leg ??
But NO.... he drags  across the ground until the dark seekers come out and attack them.... THEN afterwards of course when the damage is done, he is able to limp on that same leg and even carry Sam.

My wife kept complaining.... ""Great the dog dies because he is too stupid to hop on his one good leg and get out of there. They should have re-shot that scene differently"".

In summary it seems they had the budget to work with, but somehow the film fell FLAT and was OK..... but it is not memorable and will probably be forgotten with time.

Even allowing for it's old age.... We feel the 1956 Vincent Price version of this film ""Last Man On Earth"" actually had a stronger feeling of pathos than this remake.

But this new film COULD have been a classic if they maintained the mood of the first 40 minutes and did not turn the movie into a CGI fun-fest

PS...
The ALTERNATE ENDING is FAR SUPERIOR to the theatrical ""Happy Hollywood"" ending and while not identical to the message of the novel, does both capture the general message best and also matches the mood of the rest of the film.
The theatrical ending really weakened the film and seems like a mismatch tacked on at the end.

But it too differs from what was written in the Richard Matheson short story of the same name, and it really isn't that much better, so be warned. The bonus features include four animated short films, all related to the movie. The digital copy (on the second disc with the alternate version) allows you to copy the film to your computer taking up less space on your hard drive than if you copied it from the DVD alone - that is, if you like to watch movies on your PC. There are also bonuses you can view BUT you can only access them by inserting the DVD into your computer - you can't do it with just a regular DVD player. Too much of a pain to deal with, IMO. If you can do without all of the extras included here, then I suggest you stick to the single disc version of this film - it's cheaper.

As for this latest version of the famous Matheson post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller (there were two previous ones, ""The Last Man On Earth"" {with Vincent Price, 1964} and ""The Omega Man"" {with Charlton Heston, 1971}), it starts off strong, with Will Smith as the lone human survivor on earth of a virus that originally was developed as a cure for cancer, but went terribly awry, killing most of the world's population. Smith in his role as military scientist Robert Neville (who is immune from the virus) is intense, and his only companion is his dog Sam, a loyal german shepherd that he raised from a puppy. Sam is the only link to the lonely Neville's past and his family.

For the first hour or so of the movie, you are totally transfixed by Smith's heartfelt solitary performance and the interaction with his canine companion. In this case, the dog is definitely Neville's best friend - and his only friend, as the two of them depend on and protect each other in a desolate world. We see flashbacks of just how Robert Neville ended up in this tragic and unenviable position. Will carries the film surprizingly well on his own, as he attempts to achieve some kind of normalcy by having conversations with his dog and mannequins he set up in a store, pretending that they are living and breathing beings like himself. He and Sam live life from day to day alone - listening to reggae legend Bob Marley's music for inspiration, send out messages with the hope there is someone else out there like them and fight to survive against violent, blood-thirsty vampire-like creatures (courtesy of CGI) that lurk in dark places during the day and roam free at night. These beings were once human, but they were infected by this virus and survived - and this is what they mutated into. Neville works tirelessly to find a cure before it's too late (""I can still fix this!"") so perhaps these creatures can once again become human.

The introduction of two other human characters into the story who have traveled to a decimated New York City where Neville is - this is the point where the movie begins to lose steam. This is unfortunate, because the first part of this film really showcases just how exceptionally good Smith has become as an actor. It certainly doesn't hurt that the guy is so appealing and likeable in nearly everything he does. This withstanding, it's the second hour of the movie that falls flat. Even with the action sequences, it doesn't captivate you like the first hour did, where there was relatively little of that. You don't really feel any emotional connection to the woman and the little boy she has with her; I cared more about the fates of Neville and his german shepherd. I found the ending to be a disappointment, and having read the Matheson novel, I felt that if the screenwriters had remained faithful to the ending of the book, it might have had ended better - not happier because it isn't that type of movie - but at least you wouldn't have felt cheated. The film itself, like the two that preceded it, differs greatly from the book, but some of the changes made here worked very well - and some not so well. But ""I Am Legend"" is worth watching, at least for the first hour and to see Will Smith's amazing performance.

1603921,4,B00005JPTK,"I've read some of the other reviews here and disagree with a lot of them. I have never read the book and I saw the Vincent Price version of this movie when I was very young. So, I came to this version with basically a clean slate. And I liked it.
There are so many things I liked about it I don't know where to begin. The special effects were great, although a number of people dissed the CGI, I thought it worked well. The story follows a logical line for the situation, I liked that a lot too. Will Smith.... 'nuff said there.
The first half and the second half of the movie did, for me at least, fit together. In his travels one day, Will Smith notices one of his mannequins where he did not place it. He is distraught and investigates. While he is investigating, he's pulled into a trap similar to one he used on one of the vampires. As evening closes in, his watch beeps and wakes him up. A battle ensues between him, his dog and the 'night seekers'. During the battle he's rescued by a stranger who takes him to his home unaware that the 'night seekers' watched and now know where he and she are. They come back later that evening for the final confrontation.
So, there is a transition that takes place. It takes the movie from a peaceful but lonely route into a dangerous one. The vampires that Will Smith had been able to avoid can now locate him.
The moral and ethical implications this film stirs up are tremendous. Scientific experimentation to cure cancer seems to have been the cause of the transformation in this story. That in itself brings up endless wagers and exhaustive arguments over right and wrong. Will Smith's character states 'God didn't do this. We did.' Placing the blame for the destruction of mankind onto mankind in a way that's different from other similar movies.
Although this is not really a classic film, it is indeed a fine film and well worth watching. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or movies that can be debatable afterwards.",1206662400,,1989,4.4520547945205475
1603922,1,B00005JPTK,"The primary question is why? Why make a third adaptation of a truly horrifically boring movie? (Face it, when Vincent Price's $17 production is more compelling than Will Smith's 63 GAZILLION dollar special effects extravaganza, something stinks.)

Great, so you're the last human in New York City. There's 10 million zombipires, you, your dog and some bacon you were saving for later. Wonder how this will turn out?

Don't bother.

1603923,4,B00005JPTK,"I am going to start with a disclaimer, aimed towards fans of Matheson's book: This is not what you would call a ""faithful"" adaptation.  Matheson's novel was more of a social commentary (as was most of his work, including his several ""Twilight Zone"" episodes and movie screenplays), with an ending that left readers no doubt that he was reaching beyond the realm of science fiction and horror.  This movie...not so much.

The film must be judged on its own merits.  Fortunately, it holds up.  I was skeptical--as soon as I heard they were putting Will Smith in a production of ""I Am Legend,"" I balked.  Vincent Price pulled it off in ""The Last Man on Earth;"" I've never seen the Charlton Heston version (""The Omega Man""), so I can't judge it.  But Will Smith?  Don't get me wrong, he's a great action hero.  But this isn't--or, rather, wasn't--an action story.  So...again...Will Smith?

Well, he pulls it off.  He probably could even have pulled off a faithful adaptation; the first half shows so much potential, I think he could've gone all the way.  As is, as soon as the cheesy computer-animated monsters come in, it becomes something more of a shoot-em-up.  In fact, I'm willing to bet you that there are two good reasons for watching this movie: the scenery (my God, it'll take your breath away), and Will Smith.  Well, also the dog.  And, if you've heard about the scene that's not good for dog lovers...well, you're right.  I didn't think it would shake me much, but it did.  Kudos to the film-makers; that's probably the one scene in here that SHOULD'VE been in the Matheson novel.

So, for those doubters out there, I suggest watching the film.  If you're a Richard Matheson fan, go into it with a grain or two of salt, please, and judge the film on its own merits.  It still isn't a GREAT movie, no; it could've been, I think, had they stuck to the novel.  They digressed, however, and what we have here is a slightly-better-than-average popcorn flick, with vampire/zombie hybrid things.  And Bob Marley.",1206576000,3,2014,4.6752136752136755

When the movie was finished, I told my son I wanted to read the book.  EXCELLENT!  You won't want to put it down.  This book has such potential to make a really great movie; unfortunately, this movie does not fit the bill.

The nature of the zombie/vampires was not well explored, particularly the clear demonstration of their vestigial intelligence and apparent social organization. The film just kind of gallumphs to a close.  I would also have to agree with criticisms of the sometimes-chunky CGI; thi sis the first film I've ever saw that I actually thought, gee, it wouldn't be so bad if at some future date they went back and retouched some of the computer graphics.

I have no idea what it was.  Maybe it was having a child.  I have no idea but this is the second film he has been in where he blew me away.  Like I robot he was working within a fictional future world which is why I am comparing the films.  I think the challenge of all actors is to make the unreal, real.

I've been a fan of sci-fi, fantasy and horror since I was a child and I'm as fascinated by those genres now as I was way back when. What I often find lacking in a lot of those aforementioned genres is character developement. I believe that the director did a fantastic job in capturing that and more. The isolation! No human contact of any kind for 3+ years. An empty New York City is so bizarre to see. All Neville had for companionship was his dog Sam and some video store mannequins. The constant vigilance and fear of being found by ""The Nightseekers"". Always aware of the fact that Sam could be at risk of turning into one of...them. The disappointment of numerous failed attempts at a cure. The emptiness, the sheer boredom of a life full of pretty much nothing but monotony.
I don't want to reveal any spoilers, but at one point during the movie I sobbed like a baby. In my almost 40 years only a handful of movies have made me lose it like that. I even noticed my husband wiping tears from his eyes. Those who have seen the film should know exactly what scene I'm talking about and no, it's not the ending.

1603978,4,B00005JPTK,"This movie is sad. Very sad. And isolating. That's what you feel almost throughout. Every time Will kept trying to convince himself he'd be alright walking through the halls of an empty store, pretending to pay for things while he was ultimately alone (minus his dog), I initially thought it was strange. Then, that strangeness turned out to be very, very testing later on.

To be honest, I wasn't excited to see this movie. I didn't really hear  much about it specifically which was great. But my brother rented it so when we finally got it, I saw the back. There were ""zombies"" there and I wasn't really up for it. Not scared just totally not interested.

And then I watched. It was alright. In the beginning. But as it progressed and I digested what was going on I was amazed, captivated and totally down and out for him and his situation.

Honestly, I don't see how anyone could turn there head and say this movie ""was alright"" or ""it sucked"". But then I think and know that people have their own opinions...

For those who have yet to see it, see it. It's fabulous. I know I didn't really say much about the movie but it's interesting. The storyline is good and the characters decent. But it's mostly Will. That's what you see: Will. Every day. But once it sinks in I'm sure you'll like it too.

1603979,4,B00005JPTK,"The nicest thing about being the last man on earth would be not having to pay for parking in Times Square. There's nothing wrong with a good movie. ""I Am Legend"" may miss the mark as a great movie but what it does do it does extremely well. While Francis Lawrence's ""I Am Legend"" (this is the third version of the story told on film based on Richard Matheson's novel of the same name but it inspired countless other films including ""Night of the Living Dead"")may be bigger and bolder than ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man"" (the two other film versions of the same tale), it is the small moments as well as the action sequences that make this film worthwhile.

Will Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville a military researcher brought in to solve a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong. The virus designed to deliver the payload kills patients with those remaining alive turned into creatures that seem to have no ability to reason and become monsters. Neville fails at stopping the outbreak from spreading but he remains in New York City still searching for a cure accompanied by his only companion a dog his son gave him. While hunting for the ""Night Seekers"" for his experiments, he also must avoid being hunted by them for food.

Will Smith gives a terrific, nuanced performance as Neville and is the biggest asset. The visual effects of an abandoned and overgrown Times Square are stunning and captures the sense of isolation that Neville feels. He's not only cut off from the world but he's also cut himself off from many of his own emotions overcome by a sense of failure but still believing ""I can fix this"". There are some other fine performances in the film as well but saying any more about them would provide too many spoilers.

The main flaws of the film are the Night Seekers and plot holes in the last act of the film. The Night Seekers are effectively used but we see too much of them (they would have been more frightening in shadow)and they don't look real enough (at least to me). The plot holes in the third act I won't reveal (again, they also reveal spoilers)but suffice to say the film is very good inspite of its flaws.

The DVD has two versions of the film. The first on disc 1 is the theatrical cut (which I felt was inferior). The second disc has a short documentary on the real threat we face by viruses both natural and man made with experts from Harvard and other leading research facilities chiming in on the beauty of a virus (which is neithr living or dead according to one researched but somewhere inbetween). The second disc has the alternate cut of the film and there's also a weblink to bonus material. The Blu-ray INCLUDES the bonus featurettes which amount of about 50 minutes of material.

We also get animated comics that show the effects of the disease across the world.

Speaking of which, the theatrical cut and alternate versions are seamlessly branched on the single disc Blu-ray and HD-DVD.

While a flawed film, ""I Am Legend"" is a very good thrill ride with a strong central performance by Will Smith which sells even the weaker aspects of the story. The 2 disc DVD edition really should have been a single disc edition (with the bonus material) like the Blu-ray.",1206489600,,3220,4.550949913644214

It's foolish to directly compare this to The Omega Man or the Vincent Price version. This was a rendition of the tale shaped to fit our times.

Will Smith showed the most depth as a character that I've ever seen from him. He did a great job depicting how one might feel and act in that situation. He lost all, he's totally alone, he's up against unstoppable forces knowing help will never come, but he feels compelled to do the right thing and keep on fighting. As a Marine, I can severely appreciate that!

Special effects were outstanding. I'm a big, big fan of the whole ""one man against all odds"" theme and this was a powerful example of that.

1603981,3,B00005JPTK,"Watching ""I Am Legend"" is truly a frustrating experience and one of the greatest letdowns in movie history.
  The sci-fi plot device of a virus wiping out most of humanity is very effective and completely believable. Inevitably, this has to be compared to the film ""28 Days Later"", which is essentially identical in plot. However, where these two films dramatically diverge is in the way each protrays the infected survivors.
  In ""28 Days Later"", you can make the case that it is very unlikely that someone could be infected and within 20 seconds become a raging animal. However, all the infected people in ""Days"" are played by real actors, and the performances are riveting and believable. The first hour of ""I Am Legend"" is one of the greatest hours in sci-fi film history, as we are given a tour of New York City three years after virtually all of its population has been wiped out. The decay of this city is completely plausible, as Will Smith's character lives to survive, remain sane, and continues to work towards finding a cure for the virus.
  Where this film changes from greatness to schlock is when we see the infected survivors, who are not played by real people, but are in fact cheap CGI creations. Not only are they not remotely believable, but they exhibit physical abilities that no disease could create in real human beings. All this does is render the film as cheap fantasy instead of plausible science fiction. One key plot point is the single infected survivor that Will Smith has captured and uses for trials to find a cure. Towards the end of the film, the cure has finally been found, and the infected person begins to show signs that they are returning to normal. Since this is the only infected person played by a real actor, it would have enhanced the film to see this person return to a cognitive, rational state and communicate with Will Smith. The film is only 90 minutes and appears to have suffered from budget constraints. There are only two good actors in the film; Will Smith and his German Shepherd, Samantha. When he meets his first healthy survivors, the woman is played by some unknown spanish actress. Clearly, great attempts were made to keep the cast salaries down, which is unforgivable considering that there are less than 10 speaking parts in this film. What a shame. This film could have been so much more.",1206403200,2,2354,4.701456310679611
1603982,4,B00005JPTK,"Everyone seemed disappointed in this movie (probably because it takes a pretty high attention span to really get into).  Another reviewer commented that it ""doesn't stick closely to its' source material"", and in a way this is true, but it in a way it isn't--the film is pretty grim and though the ending strays from the novel, it is not a disappointment.

Richard Matheson was so displeased with the first version of his classic horror novel of the same name (""The Last Man On Earth"" starring Vincent Price) that he changed his name on the film's credits to ""Logan Swanson"".  One can only imagine what he thought of Charlton Heston's ""The Omega Man"", which featured zombies with afros and sunglasses.  Both of these films, however, conveyed the sense of crushing loneliness which comes through in the novel (particularly the former).  I'm not sure it's possible to successfully adopt this book to screen without departing in some way from the author's uncompromising vision.

Will Smith does a fantastically understated job as the unfortunate scientist Robert Neville, who seems to be the sole surviving member of the human race after a pernicious virus simultaneously wipes out the species and transforms them into degraded, parasitic creatures not dissimilar to mythological vampires.  Along with his dog Sam, he cruises around during the day and hides in his fortress-like apartment while they roam the streets looking for him.  The tension in this film is palpable enough to cut with a knife; the scene in which Sam unwisely runs into a very dark area, thereby sparking a confrontation between Neville and his once human foes, is nail biting and effective.  Smith brings across the psychical damage wrought by years of solitude and fear when he tearfully begs a mannequin to say hello to him, almost with the glimmer of a belief that it might indeed happen.  In nearly every way it is faithful to some of the most heart-wrenching events of the novel: Sam's transformation, for instance, into a rabid dog and what Neville has to do afterward.

The irony of Neville being a feared, monstrous being from the perspective of these creatures and his natural inclinaton to see them the same way is not brought across with as much force as it was in ""The Last Man"" but nonetheless it is delivered powerfully.  Smith's Neville ""donates his blood"" (no pun intended) while igniting a grenade in a gesture of self-sacrifice that is not candy coated.  In some ways this is one of the best versions of the novel I have ever seen, and kudos to Will Smith for a great performance.",1206403200,,2568,4.862385321100917
1603983,3,B00005JPTK,"-- No spoilers --

Will Smith surely gave this movie his ALL, and that's saying quite a lot. It takes a lot of courage and ability for one actor to carry a movie like this, yet he does it with ease. The earlier parts of the movie with he and his dog, Sam, are engaging and absorbing.  And these, merged with the flashback motif to bring the viewer into an understanding of what had happened in the past, up to the present moment of the movie work very well, indeed.

It's the rest of it that just didn't work for me. And that comprised an inertia of poor movie-making that not even Will Smith could overcome.

When we saw creatures like this in ""The Mummy"" (the Brendan Fraser versions), they worked in a fantasy way, but in that surreal/comical atmosphere, they fit in and ""made sense"". In ""I Am Legend"" they do not.

Can you think of anything about a lethal, debilitating virus that would give anyone unbelievable, superhuman speed and strength?  Can you imagine humans rendered so demented by a disease that although able to set subtle traps to catch prey, they'd hurl themselves heedlessly into objects that would rip themselves to pieces?

Again and again I kept saying, ""This just doesn't make any sense!""

And then you meet the immune ""survivors"" and the story progresses down an even more unbelievable line.  By the end of the movie you can't help but think, ""What a waste of Will Smith.""

Can Will Smith carry a movie almost entirely by himself? You bet he can! And he does a better job of it than anyone else I can think of. Had this movie not had Will Smith, and Sam the dog, it would have been unendurable. But because of them and Will's enormous talent, it rose from two-stars to three, in my opinion.  But if you really enjoyed the movie for its ""horror"" aspects, see those Brendan Fraser Mummy movies again...they were much better made.",1206403200,2,1851,4.5119760479041915
1603984,2,B00005JPTK,"""I am Legend"" Directed by Francis Lawrence

In the near future a supposed cure for cancer is created and distributed. It turns out that the cure actually becomes a biochemical disease and wipes people out at an alarming rate and those who aren't killed are turned into zombies. Robert Neville (Will Smith) believes he is the last survivor and spends his days in New York City attempting to find a cure for the disease and his nights avoiding the zombies.

I was actually expecting a lot more out of this movie. I had read rave reviews and heard first hand accounts from friends about this films greatness. What I witnessed was an average post apocalyptic type story with in my opinion sub par special effects.

The Good:  Will Smith's acting was enjoyable. The idea of the movie was good.

The Bad: Probably my biggest gripe with this move is the special effects. They were generally unconvincing throughout. I think that much more of the special effects should have been done practically instead of all of the CG. The zombies would have been better as practical instead of CG. The lions in the beginning, the grass growing up through the street and all of the little touches were obvious CG and the quality was so poor that the items that are animated became glaring. The zombies were very reminiscent of the creatures in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00000JQB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>"". That was fine almost 9 years ago but hasn't CG gotten better since then? You wouldn't guess that by watching ""I am Legend"".

Some of the plot turns seem a little bit forced. This isn't a spoiler but Will is constantly trying to shoot deer in this movie by chasing them down with his car. Why didn't he just use some of the corn he was growing as a bait pile and wait for them to come to him? Why chase them in a car or with your dog when you can get them to come to you?

Overall: This was OK but is very over hyped in my opinion. Don't avoid watching this but don't make a huge effort to see it either.",1206403200,,2128,4.829670329670329

I Am Legend Iamlegendbigposter was a huge hit in theaters and by not seeing it, avoiding spoilers for so long was difficult. As a fan of film criticism, I enjoy reading movie reviews, even for movies I haven't seen. So, going into watching this, I was already aware of the basic plot and story elements.

For those who haven't seen the film or don't know anything about it, I Am Legend is the third film adaptation of a 1954 story of the same name by Richard Matheson. The story is about Robert Neville, the last remaining human in New York following a massive man-made infectious outbreak (the Krippen Virus) that killed billions of people and turned the surviving millions into night wandering zombie-like creatures that eventually killed the few immune. Neville, a former virologist and army Colonel, is immune to the disease and spends everyday trying to find a cure through experimental vaccination tests, and every night hiding in his house which has been fortified like a modern day military base.

An empty and dilapidated New York City is hauntingly beautiful. It brings to mind Alan Weisman's The World Without Us, a story about how nature would take the Earth back if humans did not exist. Director Francis Lawrence gives us breathtaking views of a city falling apart, yet still maintaining its beauty. Humorously, the man-made features that remain in tact the most are billboards that serve as ""Easter Eggs"" for the dorks in the audience (me included), like a poster for a Batman/ Superman movie coming out in 2010.

What I wasn't aware of before seeing the movie was the most enjoyable part, the character development. Echoing, isolationist characteristics and story arcs of Cast Away, Will Smith gives a wonderful performance as Robert Neville. We're given even greater depth into Neville's character through a series of flashbacks throughout the film that detail Neville's current state of mind.

Neville creates as much artificial human contact as possible in his isolation through the use of placing mannequins in normal daily interaction situations. The scenes in the video store are some of the most truthful scenes of the movies giving a window into Neville's loneliness.

It's hard to imagine how we would act in a similar situation, but as a dog owner I know that I would rely as much on my dog as Neville does on his, Sam. Sam, a German Shepherd, is immune to the airborne strain of the virus, but not the strain transmitted through a bite. I_am_legend_will_smith__1_ Sam is as powerful of a character as Neville and through masterful storytelling and direction, the audience feels as attached to a dog as we do to the human lead. During the hunting scene we are offered our first glimpse of the infected, the terror that grips the audience not only from the fear on Neville's face, but the fear you can feel in his heart of losing his only friend.

As a dog owner, the fear of losing your pet that you love is a scary thought. Lawrence does a wonderful job of building suspense around Sam and Neville's equal need of each other and the terror that surrounds the chance of losing one another.

While Neville suspects that the infected have finally stopped showing any signs of human characteristics, he meets one infected that confuses him, showing signs of human cognition and planning. After a trap is sprung and Neville is injured, the dramatic tension quickly rises as swiftly as the sun sets. As Neville and Sam try to flee to their car, a few infected dogs wait at the fading edge of a sunbeam for their chance to strike.

(SPOILER- Skip until the end of the alert)
This scene begins the end of Neville's remaining desire to live. Iamlegendphoto21While fighting the infected dogs for his life, Neville continues to see Sam locked in a vicious fight with another dog, resulting in multiple bites and wounds. In what is by far the most difficult scene to watch and emotionally difficult, Neville tries to make Sam comfortable while seeing if a vaccinated test can stave of the infection. While Sam lays in Neville's arms dying and slowly becoming infected, tears stream down Neville's face. Neville's only choice to kill Sam the moment Sam has become fully infected.

This scene is amazingly well done. Smith's performance of saving his own life, while trying to end Sam's is heart breaking. As he end's Sam's life, you can see Neville's last hopes leave his eyes in the tears streaming down his face.

(END OF SPOILERS)

From this point on, the movie shifts into a more action oriented theme, but does not totally abandon its prior success. I Am Legend can easily be seen as two films, the first a movie of isolation and how a lone human struggles to maintain his sanity, the second a more typical Hollywood action-thriller. Bfwill

We are introduced to two new characters in the second half of the film, both of which are too little too late. Their symbolism is important, but their use in the movie could have been improved. The performances aren't on the same level as Smith's or even Sam's and it's difficult to feel any emotional attachment to them. Their symbolic presence of hope to Neville is important, as a glimpse of normality and his path to a cure and ultimately is his root to spiritual salvation.

Like the new characters the climax doesn't stir the same tense feeling initially felt in the first half. As a whole, the movie is very enjoyable, but loses focus in the end. It would be easier to grade the film by its two thematic segments, the first half getting 5 stars, the second half getting 3 stars. Despite its thematic collapse at the end, I Am Legend offers far more enjoyable moments to outweigh its faults and is a movie worth seeing.",1206403200,2,5769,4.762762762762763

He is left alone, his family and friends dead or worse, with just his dog and some mannequins for company.  What that means is that Dr. Neville (Will Smith) has to carry the story himself and he does so very well.  He displays a wide range of emotion throughout the film, making the viewer laugh and cry and ultimately sympathize with the plight of the last man on earth who just can't help but hope against hope that he can undo what has happened and redeem mankind.

If I had to point out gripes about the movie the two that come to mind  are the CGI Vampire/Zombies and the rushed and too coincidental feel of the latter part of the film.  The film maker relied too heavily on CGI antagonists when human models could have worked so much better.  Towards the end of the movie things just seem to be clicking into place too easily for random incidents and things rush rapidly to conclusion for a movie that has been moving slowly up until now.",1206316800,,1079,4.355
1604051,5,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is by far, the best movie of 2007. I even questioned myself, with the quality of movies now a days (poor plots, bad acting etc.) if Will Smith could hold down a movie for almost two hours by his self. The answer is yes. The movie kept me capitvated the entire hour and a half of it, I felt like it was timed perfectly, not too short, and not overly long either. This was one of those movies that you could feel, the fear of leaving your home on Christmas day because of a viral threat that is spreading is very scary, not to mention being the only person alive in the world for three years and counting. Will Smith deserves the Oscar for Best Actor, because it was hard not to sympathize with him, he had the eyes of Pacino in this film, you could just see the pain, fear, paranoia, etc. in his face, Just watch the part with his dog in his basement (I won't ruin the movie for those who didn't see it.). The symbolism in the movie is beautifully strewn through the film, most people don't even think enough to understand that in movies the scenes where it's kinda like ""why did the just show that?"" is connected to the story, which just makes it that much deeper, I.E. The scene where Will Smith is watching Shrek and he recites the lines of the donkey, which pretty much summed up his whole experience as the last survivor on earth, people who don't think (Americans)wouldn't understand why that scene is even in the movie. I think Americans are so stupid and critical that they forgot what the purpose of a movie is, Which is entertainment. Watching this made me remember when movies were fun and exciting, when you couldn't wait to see what happend next, it wasn't anything like these hour long crap movies that hollywood bangs out so quickly. If you;re closed minded  you will most likely not like this movie, if you the opposite hey, you might like it. I don't own a blu ray player, but I imagine this movie is super sharp when played on one, with a speaker system. Buy It and if you don't like it, sell it.

1604052,3,B00005JPTK,"Richard Matheson's book has a 'hook' that has never been exploited in any adaptaptation (although the Vincent Price version is the closest) and that is the variation on the 'One-Eyed Man in the country of the blind...'
The Vampires have taken over - there is no cure
Accept it - they have
And that's the point.  When you are the only odd one in a world that has been turned topsy turvey - night is day and day is night - then you are the monster and the monsters are normal.  Civilization continues in the hours of darkness, and mankind somehow adapts.  It is perfectly logical that they would try to destroy the creature that's killing them while they sleep, and that they would fear him.  Neville's final words in the book ""I am anaethema - I am legend."" sums it all up.  When mutation is normality - the normal man is a monster to be feared and destroyed.

1604053,4,B00005JPTK,"Okay, I admit it, knowing this was about Zombies I skipped this in the theaters, but a friend provided his DVD (my copy on the way) to me knowing that I know, Will Smith is an actor that is not only at the peak of his career, but selects his projects consisently well and never disappoints.  I know I can ""trust"" Will Smith flicks to be good and entertaining.

I got over my ""zombie"" years back in the 70s (Night of the Living Dead), but this story is a well woven masterpiece filling in temporal ""blanks"" as you focus on each scene.  By example, many flicks show you ""results"" in a scene, but never how it got that way and by example I'm pleased to see them retrospectively show how the bridges got destroyed, which was lingering in my mind since seeing the trailer.  In this fashion many other details are not left out, explained through close observation; and this is important to me in a movie.

Technically well crafted integration of computer graphic animation and ""analog"" characters and sets.  Attention to detail and budget apparently were not an issue, and it shows.  The breadth and scope of the film leave you saying, ""wow, how'd they do all that?""

I fully enjoyed Will Smiths character, Robert Neville, and his multifaceted talents as urban outdoorsman, scientist, father, husband and more all rolled up into todays ""ideal male""... compassionate, focused, capable, determined, warrior against evil, survivor, philosophical messenger, altruistic, responsible, technical problem solver yet very human in terms of being emotionally impacted by events and profoundly alone in his quest to ""make right"" what went ""terribly wrong"" with a bitter sweet ending that well... left me with a tear or two.",1206316800,,1706,4.8788927335640135
1604054,3,B00005JPTK,"Based on Richard Matheson's excellent 1960 novel of the same name, ""I Am Legend"" is a welcome, but disappointing adaptation.  Much commentary has been made about the protagonist's nemeses - the ghoulish nocturnal zombies - and their lack of believability. That impression is caused both by unfortunate choices in casting and in pop-cultural references. Star Will Smith recently appeared in a weak adaptation of Asimov's classic ""I Robot"" in which CGI robots dominated the screen.  Smith's presence reminds the viewer of the similarity of those robots to the latter film's zombies. He also starred in ""Men In Black,"" a film which opened with a CGI alien howling, shaking his head in the same manner as the zombies. There are prominent scenes in ""Legend"" in which the characters watch the animated film ""Shrek,"" another landmark effort in CGI. Inevitably, the viewer's mind is drawn to parallels between the peculiarities of the zombies' movements and those of the earlier films.

All of that aside, is ""Legend"" any good? It's mildly diverting, but any adaptation of Matheson's book must capture the terrible stillness of the soul that the last man on Earth must feel.  This film is too busy to elicit that mood, despite its attempts at pathos. There are two endings for this film: the alternate ending is more thoughtful, and is foreshadowed early in the film; I would therefore recommend the two-disc version.",1206230400,,1409,5.060344827586207
1604095,4,B00005JPTK,"MY my my. What a bunch of critics! I am suprised that many of you did not like this movie more than you did. I happen to love this movie. Now, would I have like for the film to 'trash' the CGI and use real actors? Yes. Does that happen in today's film making? Rarely. Would I have liked a 3 hour epic like LOTR that would have explained in great detail every little piece of the puzzle? Yes. Does that happen too often in Hollywood movies? Rarely.

Nonetheless the movie was fantastic. I am ecstatic that the movie strayed from the vampiric nightmarish theme that the novel used! Vampires? How 80's is that? ""BLah blah, I vunt to suck yur blohd!"" And if you all remember the ending in the book... the vampires waiting outside while Neville is locked up in 'jail' so to speak, and someone brings him a suicide pill to take so he can die so peacfully. YAWN!!!! How retarded would that have been to sit through at a movie theater. I can hear people now walking out, "" WTF was that? That's it?""

This movie brought what all of us movie goers, OK, movie goers like myself anyways, like. Suspense, action, good acting, good story line. I thought how they told the back story was great. I would have like to have seen more scenes of the decline right after the New York bridges were blown up, and some snap shots of the years that followed.

You have to admit though, when you saw the scene where Smith follows his dog into that dark building, you were in suspense! You were on the edge of your seat sucked in to that stressed out moment that Will brought to the silver screen so perfectly. WOW what a scene! I was on the edge of my seat!

When he fell victim to a trap, we were all nervous about what was going to happen. WE ALL KNEW SOMETHING BAD WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, but my goodness, it was still so intense!

I think in this world of remake after remake after remake, where comedy really isn't comedy anymore, it is just a slap stick jackass how many f bombs can I fit into a scene to inspire a vulgar laugh, where CGI rules the screen, where movies that inspired us as kids but now as their story continues they fall so very short of greatness (Star Wars), where every story has a sequel plastered all over it, I think this movie did a wonderful job capturing Will's desperate lonely dreaded tortured life.

I loved it. I cant wait to buy the DVD. And by the way, Trashcanman, you say that 'Will Smith has a penchant for picking terrible, schmaltzy films to star in', are you kidding me? Independence Day (entertaining guy flick about alien invasion, oh yea), Ali (great acting), I robot (great? no. Entertaining? Yes in a guy sort of way. Amuzing considering... someday?), In the Persuit of Happiness (heart strings if your a father, besides, true story), Enemy of the State (awesome guy flick again), Bad Boys (oh yea, another guy flick), Hitch (funny flick to take a date to), Ok I'll give you one, Wild Wild West... YUCK!!!

1604096,2,B00005JPTK,I Am Legend was without a doubt one of the most over hyped and disapointing movies of 2007.

However, that didn't hamper my overall enjoyment of the very sound acting and good technical aspects of this movie. Will smith was really good and his dialog did not contain any cheesy catch phrases. The three star rating is a solid one. My other problem doesn't have anything to do with the movie. It has to do with the studio jerks at Warner Bros. who thought it was a good idea to provide web access to the main special features only to customers who own a PC. I would never have purchased this disc if I had read the fine print at the back. I think it is simply outrageous. I generally have a problem with web access features but I never encountered a disc the restricts access  to PC users only.  Also you cant put the digital copy on your computer if it is not a PC. The digital copy is one of the main reasons I bought the disc. I think this constitutes marketing fraud because it was not made explicitly clear.  On the front of the box, and even on the Amazon website, it simply says ""Digital copy included"" not ""Digital copy for PCs only included"". I am so angry about this that I am actually going to do something I have never done before; try and return this disc. So as a warning to everyone who plans to buy this disc, if you own a Mac, don't think you are getting any back-story features of how they created an empty New York, the creating of the cool visual effects or any extra copy of the movie to put on your computer.",1206230400,4,1507,4.200692041522491

The book is actually a million times better and it's nothing like this movie ""adaptation"" - the two shouldn't even really have the same title.

I was into I AM LEGEND completely. All the way up to the revilation scene, when Robert Neville (Will Smith) finds out that he isn't alone and quite frankly, I AM LEGEND fell completely off the table and crashed into a million pieces.

I AM LEGEND had a premise that we've scene hundreds of times. OMEGA MAN. 28 DAYS LATER. You can't be out after dark. Zombies, or forms thereof. The only survivor of an incredible catastrophe. Yet, what it didn't do, is anything different. When you thought it was going in a cool direction and you were seeing something completely new and a completely original twist on an otherwise overused premise, you realized... nope... same old stuff. Nothing worth remembering.

The scenes of Will Smith racing through the baron, littered and grass covered streets of New York City, hunting deer and avoiding Lions were top notch. The scenes of him using the video store as a social outlet, with strategically placed mannequins, were well done and poigniant. The scene where he reluctantly followed his dog into the shadowed building that housed the infected humans were frightening.

Everything was going so well... and when Neville used a trap to capture one of the infected and then the infected turned the tables on him, instituting their own trap, I was sold. That was followed by some heart-wrenching moments and a confrontation scene that was creative and realistic. I AM LEGEND was right on. A memorable, hit movie. And then....

I AM LEGEND became just another movie. There were characters introduced that broke the movies rhythm. Anna & Ethan? They're clean. Calm. They appear out of nowhere, but have no knowledge of what happens after dark. She manages to save Neville from an onslaught of infected, but then shows no sign of being battle or survival tough.

There are moments where the audience isn't allowed to play along, like when the infected find Neville's hideout. It is explained by a single line of dialogue and has little to zero impact.

Ultimately though, I AM LEGEND started off unique and just became forgettable and uneventful. When a premise has been done hundreds of times, it's time for a shakeup... something new... we didn't get it with I AM LEGEND. We got 1 hour of unique moments followed by 40 minutes of the same old same old.",1206230400,8,2298,4.817258883248731

I was unpleasantly surprised to find this movie to be nothing more than a very shallow rip-off of the 1970's classic ""Omega-Man"" starring Charleton Heston. So little was changed, in fact, that it rapidly becomes a tedious embarrassment. I understand that few quality screenplays are being produced nowdays, but I still loath cheap reproductions of modern classics. ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" starring Donald Sutherland was another movie that was recent re-made into a poor quality clone. My point is, why bother? Rent the earlier versions and judge them yourselves. I don't need to spend the money in theater, nor on DVD to enshrine the sad newest rip-off versions....

Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but his starring in ""Omega Man ReVisited"" does little to rescue this movie.",1206144000,,996,6.158273381294964

The film is interesting and entertaining to a point, it just has a very unsatisfying ending and it could have used some narration. The narration could have helped explain some things going on, like where are the generators for electricity you have in your house and what is that stuff he poured on his steps etc.etc. etc.?! The CGI creatures are not all that convincing, but I could have lived with that had the film followed the original story. This could have been one of the best Sci-Fi films in history, but it's destined to be forgotten. I think the 'The Omega Man' despite it's flaws is a better film and 'The Last Man On Earth' is too, at least those films had some guts!

To make matters worse, the two disc edition is terrible! The only extra feature you get is an alternate version of the movie which is only the last few minutes. The alternate ending is not as good as the theatrical one, but strangely enough both versions have some good points and some really bad ones.

Also, I found out it was based on a novel by the great Richard Matheson which is one of the major writers of the Twilight Zone, so that sold me.  Neither one of us expected much of this movie, but both of us came out of it rating it 5 stars and already talking about looking forward to buying it when it came out.

1604235,3,B00005JPTK,"Hello,
I like Will Smith. I usually like his films. I found both versions of this one lacking, though. The heart of the problem is an incomplete story. It's flawed in its addressing of the infected inhabitants, & in explaining the viral infection. He declares victims as having become completely devolved, w/no higher thought processes left intact. Then they're shown to adapt his own snare equipment in trying to capture him. Even the alternate film, which addresses this flaw somewhat, just doesn't add up. How did the virus go from Cancer cure, to global pathogen? What was the army's involvement? Weaponization? Also, while doing a one actor film is tough. I think the story could've been portrayed better. Incidentally, did anyone else notice the infected leader's strong facial resemblance to the robot in ""I, Robot?"" I'm betting it was the same digital model of the actor from that film. I was looking forward to this movie. I'm afraid this one disappointed. Oh well. You can't hit a home run every time, right?",1206057600,2,1018,4.924418604651163

Instead, we are treated with CGI vampire-like creatures that resemble the mummies from Brendan Frasier's ""The Mummy"" movies. Instead of the thinking creatures from Matheson's book, we have mindless adrenalin-fueled eating machines, much like those in the ""28 Days/Weeks Later"" movies.

Once I realized I wasn't watching a faithful adaptation, I figured I'd let the movie stand on its own and see how it turned out. What it actually reminded me of was ""28 Weeks Later."" As a matter of fact, if this been the third movie in that series, it would have fit perfectly; although it would be the weakest link in that series.

If you are a fan of the book, you will probably be sorely disappointed with this movie. Had the powers that be behind this film stayed faithful to the original story, they'd have had a really good film on their hands.

1604237,4,B00005JPTK,"SPOILERS below!!

This is not your typical creature feature/horror/action fest of a movie.  Will Smith deserves a lot of credit for imbuing the character of Robert Neville with determination, sadness, desperation, and basic humanity in the face of unimaginable danger and desolation.
He believes he is the only man left on Earth, so we can't even imagine the depths of his loneliness.  Having watched his wife and daughter die, the only things keeping him going are the quest for a possible cure for the killer virus (which has destroyed most humans and turned the remainder into murderous freaks; and the love of his loyal family dog, Sam.
  Two scenes in particular are extremely moving and sad:  the infection of Sam, whom Robert has to put down before she turns on him; and a scene in which he begs a mannequin to say hello to him because he has heard no other human voice besides his own in three years.
  It was a bit simplistic to include scenes in which a woman and her son find Robert and he at first declares that there is no survivors' camp and no God--and then later he decides they were meant to find him because they can carry the cure (in the form of a vial of blood) with them to Vermont, where survivors do, in fact, live.
  Don't let that keep you away, though.  This is a well-done story of a man, his dog, and the fight to keep the human race going.",1206057600,,1369,4.436

Plot holes galore ,  CGI effects among the worst I've ever seen in a film , an ending that looked tacked on and rushed , and a heavy religious theme , where none at all existed in the book made this movie a huge disappointment .

I saw the trailers and knew a bit, but certainly not the entire story. I really loved the tale, and the effects were brilliant (I didn't feel the 'monsters' were too cartoonish at all). I do wish we'd seen more of the struggle of the main character when everyone was dying though. The story seemed to be broken into three parts, and not much was done to tie it all together. We did see flashbacks, but not enough to satisfy. I felt the editing was really choppy. There were some glaring omissions or at least ""what the heck"" momemnts that were just stuck in there. (How did anyone reach the island? A boat? how did they leave--?? why were the cars so shiny? lol) There were little touches I really loved in the film; the ""Shrek"" obsession, the dog, etc.
The extras that show ""out takes"" prove to be really helpful and I think some should have been left in the movie. Will Smith was brillant in this flick,btw. Great acting.

1604301,3,B00005JPTK,"The long in development I Am Legend is a flawed yet entertaining adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic horror novel, and while this is undoubtedly the best version of Matheson's work to be filmed (don't get me started on The Omega Man), the potential for what I Am Legend could have been makes it slightly disappointing.  Will Smith stars as military scientist Robert Neville, who very well may be the last man on Earth.  Along with his dog Sam, Neville searches for a way to save humanity, which has been reduced to a vampiric race after a cancer vaccine went awry three years earlier.  Where I Am Legend works is first and foremost with Smith, who is so good as the isolated, lonely, and desperate Neville that he alone will keep you glued to the screen.  Smith's performance ranks as one of his best, as sometimes we forget just how good an actor the man is, he reminds us again here.  The visions of a desolate, unpopulated New York City is also one of the film's strengths, offering some very impressive visuals.  Where I Am Legend fails however is with the directing of Constantine director Frances Lawrence, whose action scenes are made worse thanks to some surprisingly lacking digital effects work.  I Am Legend could really have been something special here, regardless of how much it departs from Matheson's book, but alas, it just isn't.  Still though, I Am Legend isn't bad one bit, and the alternate theatrical cut included in this two-disc set is even better than the regular cut.  All in all, I Am Legend is definitely worth a look whether you are a fan of Will Smith's or a fan of Matheson's work, but be prepared to start thinking of what could have been after the credits start rolling.",1206057600,,1707,4.644518272425249
1604302,1,B00005JPTK,"My first review with amazon begins with the I Am Legend movie 2 disc DVD set.  Let me start by saying first, that the one star rating is NOT for the movie itself.  Rather, it is only for the horrendous DVD presentation package.  What do I mean?  Read on. I did enjoy the movie when it came out in theaters and was highly anticipating it's release on disc, mainly so I could see all the bonus stuff and hear commentary on the film.  So of course I bought the 2 disc set, popped it into my player at home and...where the **** is my commentary?!  Oh, there is none.  Well that makes sense given there were several key parts of the film that the director could have elaborated on including why he choose to make an alternate ending (but we'll get to that in a minute).  I see on the disc it says to insert into your computer DVD ROM drive to enjoy all of the bonus material.  First of all, since when do I need a computer drive with internet connection to review bonus movie material on a DVD?  Second, if you don't have WIndows XP you can't watch it on your computer either! What ******* genius thought that up.  If I'm blowing $22 out of my pocket then I should be able to put any of these discs in my regular DVD player and just watch the extras.  And now, onto the alternate ending.  On the one hand I had fun watching it because it showed more of the Darkseekers.  On the other hand, the director definitely was right in not choosing this ending for the theatrical release.  It was too cliche and digressed too much into zombie love story (undoing Neville's theory that the creatures are no longer capable of human behaviors)implying that now he's going to give up searching for a new cure.  It just didn't flow well with the rest of the movie's themes.  But like I said I got a kick out of it.  The other problem with this alternate ending being put on a seperate disc, is that it would have made lots more sense to just have the original movie on the first disc (WITH COMMENTARY) and have the bonus features on the second disc along with the alternate ending as a deleted scene since it was the only thing different about the movie.  Why give me a copy of the same movie twice just because the last three minutes are different.  So overall:
The movie: I enjoyed it. I'd say about four stars.
The DVD presentation:  PPPHHHHBBBBTTTTT!!! RRIIIIIPP OOOOOOFFFFF!!!! Just buy the single release disc for $13 bucks or whatever it is and save the rest of your money for a DVD release with a proper set up.",1206057600,11,2500,4.310492505353319

If they are going to offer this feature, they ought to make it compatible with THE largest digital media platform, which is iTunes and its associated products. Don't rip off consumers by promising a 'digital copy' that doesn't work with anything. The point of having a digital copy is so that you can put it on digital devices OTHER than your computer.

1604306,5,B00005JPTK,"""I Am Legend"" is another film based on a book, that does not EXACTLY follow said book. People, what do you want? I know of no film that stayed ENTIRELY faithful to any book! This ""adaptation"" was as good or better than the two films that preceded it.
To rank them based on their merit and entertainment value:

1) ""I Am Legend""
2) ""The Last Man on Earth""
3) ""The Omega Man""

For many years, ""The Last Man on Earth"" was the best adaptation seen until ""I Am Legend"" was released (""The Omega Man"" was a pale shadow compared to it's contemporaries).
The film is well defended. We still have a world very nearly devoid of human beings, the army of Hemocytes and all the trappings of a fortress that our protagonist Robert Neville, maintains to continue his research to find a cure.
The Hemocytes were effective, as there is a method to their madness. These aren't mindless zombies. They possess the intelligence to set traps. This leaves Neville with the unenviable task of second-guessing them just to stay alive (he is not entirely successful).

WARNING!!SPOILER ALERT!!!  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X

Neville's penchant for talking to his dog Sam, is particularly convincing, and sad. There are many of us who do this (myself included), which makes the loss of Sam heartfelt.
When Anna and Ethan arrive, Neville displays some strange behavior, as if he does not believe it is possible that others survived (kind of like pinching one's self to make sure it isn't a dream). Neville's argument about the plague being manmade, rather than an ""act of God"", bespeaks a man that has carried a mountain of guilt on his shoulders for his part in the disaster.

""I Am Legend"" doesn't introduce anything new beyond the two previous films, but the use of CGI (which is not entirely great) makes the action introduced in the film effective. Will Smith does an EXCELLENT job. He's no Vincent Price, but he IS action-friendly, which makes the film that much more entertaining!

There are some interesting special features: Four animated comics related to the film, and DVD-ROM features on the film, and a history on viral infections.

*Excellent special effects.
*Excellent, imaginative, vivid settings and imagery.
*Pretty good, interesting main character.
*Pretty good story, portrayed in an interesting way.
*Good suspense in some parts.
*Good drama.
*Strong themes about men messing with nature.
*Strong themes about fate.

The Bad Things
*It's short, and seems like there could have been more.  In particular, the main character never develops a strong relationship with the survivors he encounters.
*Not much action.
*I can't help but to notice that the mutant zombies look fake.  They're like a cross between ""LOTR""'s Gollum and ""The Mummy""'s Imhotep.  Thus, they are not very menacing.

Unlike its predecessor ""Omega Man,"" this film has much less action, and focuses more on drama, suspense, characters, and themes.  But even if it is slow-moving, the imagery is great, the film is well-made (even if the camera shakes a little), and has some strong, interesting themes and ideas.

The 1st disc is no different than the single release. It contains the theatrical version of the movie and 4 animated comics: Death As a Gift, Isolation, Sacrificing the Few for the Many, and Shelter.

The 2nd disc contains the movie as it was in the theater except for how it ends. I won't spoil it, but it adds about 4 minutes more and the ending is completely different from how it ends in the theatrical release. The 2nd disc also allows you to download a digital version of the movie to your computer or portable media device.

Overall, I feel this 2-disc edition is not worth the extra money it costs. Why Warner Bros. couldn't just create a branching edition of the movie on the first disc seems to point towards corporate greed. But, I'm seeing this more and more on other releases where the 2nd DVD is nothing more than a way to purchase a digital version of the movie. Pretty lame in my honest opinion.

I say rent the 2-disc version if you wish to see the alternate ending. Otherwise, if you wish to purchase the movie, just go and get the single disc version instead. It's cheaper and you really aren't losing out on the alternate ending which really isn't controversial at all.

However, due to the lack of special features (making of documentary, etc) and the cheap attempt at charging more money by supplying a different cut of the movie on a separate disc as well as to download a digital version of the movie, this 2-disc release gets a 1 star.

The dog: The fact that he started off with the dog was a disappointment.  In the book, he was nearly insane with loneliness by the time he found the dog, and it saves his sanity.  Either they should have stuck to the source or not borrowed this from it.

The monsters:  In both book and previous movies they were still fairly intelligent, could talk and plot against him, and  in the end formed their own society.  Were where the mental chess games between him hunting and them hiding?  I'd be ok with some major changes here, but they still need to show more hunting and seeking than just two scenes.

His house: In both the book and the movie it was an impenetrable fortress, which led to its own claustrophobic problems.  I loved in the book how they would call to him and wage psychological games with him, like the women flashing him anytime he looked out the window, and taunting him to come out and play.  I the origian movie they would call to him and throw things at the house.  This was completely left out of this movie.  When they did ""find"" his house they broke through the iron gates and barred windows in a matter of seconds.  This was unbelievable, porely explained, and a total let down.

While I am disappointed with the writers, the acting was fairly good.  I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater, but I am not sorry I watched it on DVD, and I will probably buy the two disk set just to see the alternate ending which I have not yet viewed. Perhaps it is better.

1604366,1,B00005JPTK,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was pretty good but it totally missed the point of the original story.  If this was an original IP it wouldn't have gotten 1 star.

Because Hollywood thinks that American movie-goers are simple, and will settle for the same crappy mix of self-sacrifice and sadness that has been the theme of too many movies (mixed with some cool CG) they decided to completely dumped the original meaning of the title ""I Am Legend""; which I might add, if I think about it in its original context is chilling and genius.  The alternate ending somewhat makes up for what was shown in theaters but, they really screwed up by cutting it just to appeal to more consumers.  That's all this film was, it took a mildly popular and ingenious story and twisted the ideal into something more ""lowest common denominator"" for profit.",1205884800,23,834,4.653061224489796

1604418,4,B00005JPTK,"Unlike most of the other reviews, I have not seen any of the other incarnations of the novel, nor have I read the actual novel. I saw the preview for this movie and it piqued my interest.  I saw the movie first in the theater and, like most people, was blown away by Will Smith's performance.  (I know that horror movies are rarely in contention for Oscar's, but I feel Will's performance was Oscar worthy.)  The movie itself was very good, although in the theatrical version, i wasn't totally clear on the reason for 'Fred' being moved, and from that point on, the theatrical version for me was not as great as it could have been.  Maybe my imagination failed me that day in the theater.
Then i purchased the two-disc version.  i was BLOWN AWAY by the 'alternative' version.  Keeping in mind I have not read the novel or seen the other versions, the 'alternative version' on this DVD package was the story I was hoping to see.  This time, with clearer understanding of the events that happen after (and around) the 'Fred' incident, the movie did not let go.  This again shows that studio execs. do NOT understand the movie going audience.  I do not see this ending as 'controversial', but rather hopeful.  The Alpha Male's actions lend hope to the society of vampires/Zombies...maybe not in the 'cheesy all's well that ends well' kind of ending hollywood is known for, but in a 'this is the way life has progressed, lets make the best of it' kind of way.  Yes, this movie does borrow from stories like  28 days later, but (like 28 days) has the desire to show that life is not a hollywood 'romanticized' ending, but a real world where life happens and humanity must learn to adapt.
As far as the CGI effects for the vampires/zombies, I feel they enhanced (both) versions of the story.  I did not feel they were a distraction or even noticeable, other then knowing now-adays, CGI is the way to produce these kinds of effects.  Think about it : would it have been better to see human/stunt men perform some of the movements, which would have made teh monsters HUMAN and thereby fallible, or CGI i them, making them capable of superhuman actions.  And that effect also shows the juxtaposition of the movie - while Robert (Smith) continues to 'live' in a real world, the zombies have 'evolved' to a new realm, creating a heigherarcy he cannot compete with.",1205884800,,2353,4.5823389021479715

Now the film, I'm some beers deep as I write this and there are some plot holes as said beer wears off, however it is a good time.  This graphic novel for a hollywood movie doesn't go 100% sappy or happy ending on us, it shows pain.  Also cash cow Will Smith isn't such a cliche character.  Speaking on Will Smith he is a good cryer, along the lines of Mel Gibson.  I knew this ever since Fresh Prince when Carlton accidently took pills from Will's locker and needed his stomach pumped, or when his dad didn't show up when he was supposed to, Will Smith crying can get to you, he is a good actor.  Besides being a good actor as I mentioned he is a cash cow every film he is makes around $100 mil, with I am Legend topping $200 mil, Adam Sandler is another safe bet at the box office, although I'm not loving his movies.
I expected amazing sound out of this blu ray, however the movie isn't trying to be transformers, it's the end of the world, how loud could it be?

1604425,4,B00005JPTK,"Interestingly, 2 adaptations of the Richard Matheson book have already been done with ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man"" showcasing the same kind of premise of supreme loneliness and isolation. It's one of those stories that seems ripe for re-interpretations and such a simple idea can bring with it a number of tries to get the story going. This version is probably one of the better ones but it's not perfect by any means and it's either the closest we'll get to a great adaptation or it's just not the right approach.

Robert Neville is a military scientist trying to find the cure for a virus that wiped out nearly the entire world's population. Living in New York with his dog Sam, Robert spends his day renting videos in alphabetical order, chatting to mannequins he's set up and waiting at a pier in case people who hear his broadcast show up. But when the watch's alarm goes up, he heads back home before the sun goes down as strange sounds and creatures come out at night, leaving him to fend for himself while he tries to find a cure.

The first hour or so is one of the more well executed parts in the entire film and you're on your way thinking this is going to be a great movie. But then Neville turns out to not be entirely alone and the film kind of dips into ""eh"" quality. The screenwriters (one being Akiva Goldsman who's responsible for the unholy mess that is Batman and Robin) manage to keep our interest entirely by showing the various ways you can keep busy in a desolated New York. It changes a couple of elements from the book that work a bit better and thanks to the visuals which show vegetation growing out of the pavement, cars all over the streets and even wildlife showing up now and then it becomes impressive how well it's keeping our attention.

It's the last act which falls apart as it's not a bad idea storywise it's just handled improperly and starts with a couple scenes, involving Shrek and Bob Marley that fall completely on their face and they're just strange. Then of course there's the look of the creatures which, instead of taking the ""guy in costume"" approach, they're entirely computer-generated and they look so bad and practically PC quality that it's distracting.

Best thing easily about the movie is Will Smith who shows what a lot of people knew all along: he's an incredibly charismatic and likable actor that makes it hard not to want to watch him. But being the only actor for a large chunk of the film was a feat some were curious about and he doesn't just ham it up either and gives an emotionally charged performance that shows he can act and films like Ali or the Pursuit of Happyness are not his only forum for breaking his ""Fresh Prince"" persona, usually seen in the blockbusters.

Since it's probably the biggest DVD/Blu-Ray release this week, I'd have to recommend the film since everyone will want to see it but I'm not sure how many will enjoy it.",1205798400,,2922,4.505660377358491
1604426,2,B00005JPTK,"While watching this horrible retelling of Matheson's brilliant I AM LEGEND, I was struck by the frightening similarity between the exaggerated facial characteristics of the rabid infectoids of this flick and those rebellious androids of I ROBOT, also starring Will Smith. Weird. The CGI faces are identical. Leftover CGI from I ROBOT? Or the same bad Special Effects team? Or does this Scientologist know something about the future that I don't know? The CGI in this looks stupendously awful. (Nothing looks real in this movie. Even New York looks a storyboard.) I thought I was watching the Prequel to I ROBOT. Will Smith once again battles bad CGI characters run amok. Yeah, bwoy!!

For the sake of realism, the commercial/music video director, Francis Lawrence should have used real actors and animals instead of this low-budget CGI. Alas, it still wouldn't have saved this from the awful screenplay. However, Smith does get to act crazy with a mannequin. And, he gets to recite lines from his favorite movie, SHREK. Hey, now. A reviewer below compares this to Dawn of The Dead. NOT EVEN in the same ballpark!! The remake or the original!

Will Smith is NOT BAD in this. At least the writers and producers kept him from saying one too many smart alecky one-liners and kept him from acting like his usually off-putting conceited self. After his genuinely affecting performance in THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, this is definitely a step down for him. It doesn't serve him well.

NOTE: It would have been apropos if Charlton Heston would have sung a Bob Marley tune in THE OMEGA MAN, as he fills a couple of plague ridden albinos full of white hot lead. Of course, THE OMEGA MAN was made before Marley got famous, so Heston could have hummed a few bars of Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat Song. They missed a great opportunity to add real depth to Heston's character.

Will Smith seems destined to fashion his career into a string of low-rent sci-fi movies from superior quality sci-fi books. If so, maybe next time he'll do that crazy Scientology Legend of Xenu. (If you've never heard this story, Google it. Some of your favorite movie stars actually believe this stuff.) Now, that would be a great flick... No, wait. Come to think of it, L. Ron Hubbard was a hack. My only hope is that Will Smith doesn't decide to remake DUNE.

Two Stars. One Star for a great performance by a German Shepherd in a Lead Role, and another Star for only being 90 minutes in length.

1604487,4,B00005JPTK,"Like every fan of the genre, I was looking forward to the new version of Richard Matheson's classic I AM LEGEND. I've read the book many times and I've seen both THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and THE OMEGA MAN  too many times to count.

This was probably a bad thing, I thought. It was going to be difficult for any film to live up to the kind of expectations you have with that kind of background. I wished I was one of those lucky people who would be going in cold and be able to just judge it on its own merits.
Yep, that would have helped, because towards the end the film makers lost their focus, got sloppy and frankly confused some of us who are familair with the book.

Up until then, however, they were doing a wonderful job! The up-dating to the new century was smooth and forgiveable, the device that sets the plague and the plot in motion was slick and logical. Will Smith gave a touching performance as a man in complete isolation. I just hated those lousy computer generated vampires! And there weren't enough of them considering how many people had fallen to the plague.

Maybe one day there will be a perfect adaptation of I AM LEGEND, probably not since perfection is subjective. Until then this is pretty damned close.

Especially if you've seen THE OMEGA MAN!

  Time has passed since my initial viewing of this film and I've been able to reconsider things in the harsh light of day. And I'm afraid that the sad truth is that this is a seriously flawed film that is carried only by the strong performance of its star. There are far too many questions that the viewer is left with afterwards: like how did the woman get on the island?  How did she get off? Remember the bridges and tunnels had all been destroyed long ago. If even 90% of the population had been turned into vampires there should have been a lot more of them then that, there seemed to be only a couple hundred vampires in all of New York City, even with computer generation. Why doesn't Neville ever monitor his radio to see if anyone is sending messages like he does in the book? Then he too might have learned of the safezone, it would have made sense for him to do that. And it would have made sense for him to do his lab work at night rather than as part of his day routine, those winter nights can be pretty long in the north and you wouldn't want to waste all your scavenging and hunting time doing stuff you could be doing at night. That's the way he does it in the book. And speaking of the safezone in Vermont or New Hampshire or where ever, that has confused some of the people I've spoken to. They seemed to think that it was safe there because of the cold! Well, if that were the case, why not Canada? It would hardly be a worldwide plague if cold killed the virus. But in all fairness, the people with whom I spoken people live in Florida and can't relate to the concept of cold very well. And there are many more examples I could give. And they are all evidence of sloppy writing.

  In the end all of I AM LEGEND's serious flaws are caused by one thing; that is written by people who neither respect nor understand the genre in which they are working, and in the  retrospect it shows.
  I've been forced to lower my rating of it to a hesitant 3 stars.",1205798400,3,3243,4.258957654723127

As in the movie ""The Omega Man"", don't expect a happy outcome for Neville played by Will Smith.  At least not in the Theatrical Version, the Alternate version has a happier ending. If you enjoyed the version with Charlton Heston you will probably like this version with Will Smith. One thing I have to agree with several reviews here is they should have used real humans for those infected as they did in the first movie. The CGI versions are a bit over the top and don't feel real. CGI is fine as long as it is mainly used for mattes and large creatures, but when you try to make humans with it, it seems almost like watching a cartoon. Only some ""Resident Evil"" computer gamers may think they are acceptable. It isn't that I don't like CGI, I thought ""Beowulf"" was quite well done. It just didn't work here. Sometimes makeup is far more effective. Personally I would have loved to seen the infected people and animals more realistic, in other words people and dogs with makeup, not CGI. The story premise is somewhat like the book, a virus wipes out mankind. Neville and a few other humans have survived.

Neville believes everyone has now changed to the cannibalistic creatures that come out at night. His family is dead but he has a dog as a companion in this ""I Am Legend"" version. An interesting twist to how those changed, don't want changed and they are clever enough to even trap Neville. He keeps telling them he can fix this when in fact they don't desire it like he does. His dog is his best friend and probably the last thing that keeps him from going crazy with loneliness. His dog will sacrifice itself to save him inevitably. Neville will sacrifice himself for what is left of mankind as well when the time comes. Most of us would die for someone we love, so keeping that in mind it is a little easier to take the trajedy when it comes. Until then he and his dog hold up at night in his fortress like apartment and come out to scout the city for food, DVDs, and the location of infected colonies during the day. Chasing deer in a Shelby Mustang is one of the few thrills left to him. He must be home by dusk and make sure the Zombies don't follow him if he hopes to survive.

I enjoyed the movie and Bob Marley music and I think it has good replayability. Good quality DVD with animated shorts on the basic single disc, and commentarty, interviews, and much more on the two disc version.

The Blu-ray version is excellent and has excellent quality picture and sound.  Several extras including the Theatrical and Alternate Version. I highly recommend getting the Blu-ray if you enjoy this movie.

But if you approach the movie as if you've never read the Matheson novels, then you won't be disappointed with the director's vision and Will Smith's performance.

Superb, classic source material once more bastardized, replaced with typical Star-Vehicle lameness by the hacks of Hollyweird.

Instead of offering us a nicely thought out story where the (genius) Neville supplied himself with intelligent options and a backup plan to escape to secondary hideouts (imagine a highrise where he could have fended off stairwells full of attackers ) - thus prolonging the suspense and action - we are given...Shrek from a basketcase.
Instead of exciting scenes in which the superb survivor and rationalist Neville investigates what would have been portentous signs that the infecteds were becoming increasingly aware and manipulative (the mannequins!) - and thereby stuggles to more quickly obliterate their lairs - we are offered...an utterly lame and unbelievable night rescue.

Opportunity after opportunity cluelessly squandered, lost, thrown away.

1604495,4,B00005JPTK,"This is the third film adaptation of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"" novel.  The first was an Italian Sci-fi called The Last Man on Earth (1964), and second was The Omega Man (1971) with Charlton Heston.

I saw the Omega Man a couple years ago and enjoyed it.  Then when I heard there was a remake in the works I was excited to go see it.  Before going to see it in the theater I watched the Omega Man again but was not as impressed as the first time, I guess some movies just wear off after watching them once or twice.

Anyway, onto I Am Legend...  this movie was very exciting ""edge of your seat feel"" for a large part of the movie.  The movie started off with an amazing scene of New York City a few years after an apocalyptic event.  There were similar scenes in Omega Man but not nearly as detailed as these scenes.  The movie goes on to tell how one man works to cure a virus while living in a city of infected mutants.

I won't go into detail of the story since I don't want to give anything away, and you can always read other review that has a synopsis of the plot.  Some other treats are the excellent performance by Will Smith, the Bob Marley tunes that are played and the intense scenes involving Robert Neville (will Smith) and his dog vs the infected/mutant like people.

If you are interested in survivalist type sci-fi films then this is definitely a must see.  Also, if you like post-apocalyptic genre then you'll want to watch this film.",1205712000,2,1457,4.293040293040293
1604496,4,B00005JPTK,"When you look at `I Am Legend' you may initially shrug it off as nothing more than summer blockbuster popcorn fluff; just another horror film targeting today's youth and wasting our hard earned money.  You will most likely still go see it because, quite frankly, no one can resist Will Smith.  The film will start and you'll think that the depictions of New York, barren and desolate, are pretty creepy.  You'll see Smith driving a hundred miles an hour down the empty streets and you'll wish you could do that.  You'll see him hunting deer with his dog and it'll all seem pretty cool but what you won't realize is that you are slowly being drawn into the loneliness that is Robert Neville's existence.  You will watch his everyday life unfold and you'll find yourself feeling cold and distant and alone.  Before a single `vampire' appears on the screen you will be petrified.

`I Am Legend' works so well because Will Smith is really that good in it.  Regardless of what anyone says, Will Smith is one excellent actor.  He's the type of actor that has everything you need to be successful.  He's attractive, he has charm and charisma; he's a riot in person and on film but he can also evoke very mature and stunning emotions that many wouldn't assign him.  In that respect he always proves himself a surprise to the viewer.  Here is no exception.  He elevates what could have been nothing more than a Hollywood monster movie into a serious and commanding look at loneliness and desperation.  In fact I'll be so blunt as to say that the best scenes in this film are when Will Smith is the only person on the screen, when he is alone and vulnerable; not when he is being pursued by the monsters.

`I Am Legend' is the third revamping of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name.  It tells the story of Robert Neville, a scientist who happens to be the only survivor after an outbreak turns the world's population into walking zombies, or vampires.  He walks the streets of Manhattan during the daylight with his loyal German Shepherd Samantha and hides in his home at night while the creatures roam the streets looking for food.  During the day he attempts to live a life that is as normal as possible.  He sets up mannequins in video stores and carries on conversations with them.  He sticks to a schedule of exercise and meals and hunting.  He drives in his car and listens to Bob Marley and talks to his dog and pretty much does everything he can to stay sane.  He also broadcasts a message over the airwaves everyday looking for other survivors and he waits at the dock everyday at a specific time for them to arrive.

The first half of `I Am Legend' plays out much better than the second because it's a slow build of human emotion.  Watching Smith's desperation grow across his face we are brought into his life and his situation and we feel his pain.  The second half, which introduces to us the creatures as well as another human survivor, steps a little bit away from the focus on Neville's loneliness and tries a little too hard to force fear on us by using the creatures.  This fear would have been much more rewarding had the creatures not looked so CGI animated.  They somewhat take away from the realness and rawness of the film when they look more like aliens then mutated humans.

One thing that remains on point throughout though is Will Smith.  This may be one of his finest performances to date, seriously.  The emotion that he portrays his so real, so strong.  There is one scene in particular, where he breaks down crying in the video store as he begs for a female mannequin to talk to him, that got me all choked up.  His performance is so committed, so vital to the film that you can't help but give him props for delivering a very believable and very moving performance.

In the end there are some things I would have changed here.  I would have hired actual actors for the roles of the `vampires' (although I hear that they had initially done that but felt that they looked too much like mimes) because I feel that the CGI was a little overdone.  I would have stuck a little closer to the book and eliminated the `other' survivor.  But there are too many things that I would have left alone; that work so well here that it seems silly to complain.  The first half of the film is in a word `perfect' and that alone is enough to elevate the rest of the film.  Smith is a goldmine of emotion here and delivers a solid award worthy performance that tops his Oscar nominated performance from last year.

If the CGI creatures hadn't spoiled my fun (just a little) I would be quick to label `I Am Legend' as one of the best films of 2007.  That little issue aside though, `I Am Legend' is far better than some may expect and will definitely leave you with much to talk about.",1205712000,4,4797,4.462686567164179
1604537,3,B00005JPTK,"This is an entertaining movie if you like action with no storyline. This is not a very intelligent movie.

The storyline is as follows: A researcher is able to change the Measles virus into becoming a cure for Cancer. However, the virus mutates inside the body and turns people into monsters. The virus becomes airborne and all of humanity becomes infected. The story takes place in New York, where the character of Will Smith is the only human survivor. Lions and tigers are free to roam the streets of New York (probably escaped from the zoo), and they compete with the character of Will Smith for the ultimate food: deer! At night, the monsters, or more precisely, the diseased humans, roam the streets looking for flesh. They can only hunt at night, for sunlight mysteriously burns them up. Will Smith eventually finds the cure, and humanity is saved! The end.

The best part was the story about Bob Marley. I didn't know Marley appeared for his concert two days after he was shot. I never knew that. I ended up downloading all of Marley's songs from iTunes.

For visual effects (or special effects if you prefer) I give it 5 stars. The images of New York after the extinction of man are spectacular. But amazing visual effects alone do not make a movie. The storyline is a bit too simplistic, and it seemed like the director was in a hurry to end it. There are no twists to the story; no moments of thrill and intrigue. The movie is actually predictable.

One thing I can say is that I was amazed by the muscular body of Will Smith. Will he become the next Rambo?",1205712000,,1568,4.51056338028169
1604538,4,B00005JPTK,"In the genre of the post-apocalyptic type films ""I Am Legend"" has to be one of the best. This type concept in films is quickly growing old but this one feels like an original idea. I was hooked from the very moment I started watching.

Will Smith does a tremendous job as a scientist who is seemingly a sole survivor in a world filled with infected super human creatures. As he tries over and over to find a cure for the virus he must endure living with no human contact. His only friend is a very loveable German Shepherd who keeps him sane. Day in day out he sends out radio messages for any survivors to meet him at a certain location where he patiently awaits until sundown. Once the sun goes down it is time to get inside and board up the house as the creatures come out and pray for sun up.

I absolutely recommend I am Legend for anyone. I really think you will enjoy it even if you typically wouldn't go for this type of film.",1205625600,3,934,4.183333333333334
1604539,5,B00005JPTK,"I first read Richard Matheson's tale I AM LEGEND, back in college.  Originally written in 1954, the story fit perfectly with this period of literary horror in the post-WWII world.

Depicting the struggle of one man to survive, and keep his sanity, in a world overrun with vampires, Robert Neville hunts these creatures by day, and returns to his ""coffin"" by night for protection from the undead - a uniquely perverse twist on the vampire myth.

Having seen both the excellent Vincent Price and Charlton Heston versions of the story, I must say that the performance by Will Smith in this movie was the best of the three, capturing the inner torment of Neville in his impossible struggle.

For fans of the story I AM LEGEND, which was the inspiration to authors like STEVEN KING, and set the trend for the next 50+ years of vampire and zombie novels, comic books and movies, I also highly recommend the following products - you will not be disappointed:

1604540,2,B00005JPTK,"Sigh... I had high hopes for this film that were ultimately laid low. Will Smith is great as Neville, but why did they mix up a few different scripts, including using ideas from The Omega Man (which is still my favorite adaptation) rather than SIMPLY USE THE BOOK. I Am Legend is the greatest Vampire Novel ever written. It should be done, one day, as the book, not a conglomeration of ideas from other films. As many have said, the first half of the film is great. Smith alone with his dog (which doesn't happen in the book, but when Neville does find the dog it's the books strongest point), traveling through a devestated New York (and done very well). Where the movie fails though is in a few major points: 1 - Making the infected non-characters. In the book they are your neighbors and friends, not simple, doofus, monsters of the week. 2 - Removing his wife and child in a helicopter crash, rather than having them be infected.
3 - The rather smarmy ending, which feels tacked on (even though Neville does have to die). The film is good, but far from perfect. Perhaps one day someone will have the guts to do it as the book, and not just pander to a star and the idea of simply making money.",1205539200,,1197,4.37219730941704

1604545,5,B00005JPTK,"This remake of Omega Man (staring Charlton Heston), which itself is a remake of  Vincent Price's The Last Man on Earth, is arguably the best of the three.

I watched both of the above movies in preparation for viewing I am Legend.  Each is campy and fun, updated for its own time.  I expected the same from this:  another fun zombie movie.  I was quite mistaken.

Although not a die hard fan of Will Smith, I am in awe of his stellar performance in this movie.  It is basically a one man show, and Smith hands-down proves he has the talent and screen presence to successfully pull it off.  It is a riveting performance; one in which Smith lives up to his potential as a cinematic leading man.  His emotions are realistic and run the gauntlet:  anger, humor, hope, love, caring, despair, shock, loneliness, fear. He does it all and leaves you believing.

The cinematography of a deserted New York is outstanding, both oddly beautiful and action packed.  The opening sequences grab you and glue you to your seat.  The scenes of Smith hunting on the streets of NYC really drive home just how alone he is.

The infected, the CGI vampires, actually made my skin crawl.  All the effects were well done, and allowed the viewer to successfully suspend his disbelief.

Overall, this is a great film.  It still affected me days after I had seen it.  And that is exactly what a good movie should do.",1205280000,,1388,4.524193548387097

1604597,5,B00005JPTK,"I would have to say that I am kind of a connoisseur of Apocalyptic movies and since I have never read the book everyone says this movie is based on; I went in with no preconceived notions of what it ""Should Be""...

I thought the CG of New York was incredible and the creatures were believable and scary.  I do however question Neville's choice of car... Red Mustang?  Hello, Chick Car.  Why not get something more manly and more practical (since he was hunting) like a hemi powered pick-up?

Other than that all I can say about this movie is... WOW!  It was a great movie that gripped you right from the start and I did not feel like the tempo was up and down, like some have said.  I felt an affinity for Neville and at times understood what he was going through to some extent, not because I have been the lone survivor in a city hiding from zombies, but because the part was so well played by Will Smith and the crew that produced the movie did a fantastic job.

My final thoughts are this, it was a movie that left me thinking about it days later and at odd times because it was such a great movie, and I would recommend people to see the movie with an open mind and forget the book, if you want the book read it, enjoy the movie for what it is... a great movie.",1205193600,2,1266,4.1387755102040815
1604598,4,B00005JPTK,"I read Matheson's ""I am Legend"" just a few years ago and I loved it.  I had read ""Hell House"" and I was just so amazed at the wide scope he could take in the horror genre.

When I heard they were making or re-making ""I am Legend"" I was really excited.  When I read that they were having it take place in New York I become a little suspicious as the book takes place in L.A.  What other changes would they make to the original story?

Well it turns out the New York setting worked quite well.  Seeing Will Smith hunting deer on Broadway or driving down the empty streets of America's most populated city had a great dramatic effect.
Much of the original book was changed however, some for better and some for the worse.  Most notably was the ending.

As others have pointed out, the first half of the film is just so powerful, packed with the shock of seeing what the world has become after this vampire virus spreads as well as the emotional plot turns.
The second half of the film seemed somewhat rushed to me.  Now I have no way of knowing in what order they shot the scenes but I felt that maybe the writing could have been better for the second half of the film.  For instance, and this may be a slight spoiler, the scene at the pier at night, I thought it would have worked perfectly if they had stuck more to the book and had the ""civilized"" vampires rescue him from the other vampires like in the book instead of how they did it in the movie.  But that's another part of the book they left out entirely; the different classes of vampires that sprang up.  Yes I know that Matheson never actually calls them vampires but we all know that's what they are.

Overall, this is a good film and I intend to actually buy it when it comes out on DVD.  There are few apocalyptic stories that I think pull it off and this is one of them.  The visual effects for the transformed New York are stunning though the vampire creatures could have been better.

Will Smith proves in this film that he's not just an actor who is suited for comedy or light drama.  His role in this is somewhat similar to ""I, Robot"" though so much of the film depends on him and he pulls it off quite well.",1205107200,,2174,4.2
1604599,4,B00005JPTK,"Spoiler Alert!

Will Smith stars in a movie that is worth all the hype. In marketing this movie, they did a good job to show absolutely nothing as to intrigue audiences. Even though this is technically a remake, it stands up by itself as if it wasn't.

The plot is masterfully crafted . The end was somewhat expected, as finding a cure would be only the way to go, but Smith dying was totally unexpected, at least in my opinion.

There is little to gripe about this one. But what needs to be griped about is the insanely bad CG. In this age where every other cartoon movie is CG, to have such horrendous animation is inexcusable. I guess all the budget for the movie went into paying Will Smith.

Another thing people complained about was how Will Smith seemed to act like himself. With Will Smith, this seems to work in almost every movie he stars in. If you see this movie, you will not be disappointed, except by the CG.

Verdict: See this moving, great film now.",1204934400,,966,4.374301675977653

The specical effects are spectacular in the scenes showing lions roaming New York. However, the ""zombies"" look fake. They don't look realistic like the creatures in Lord of the Ring.

1604606,4,B00005JPTK,"In I AM LEGEND, New York City is a barren, apocalyptic landscape that has reverted to a wild and natural landscape where only one man, Robert Neville (Will Smith) hunts and lives. Years earlier a cure for cancer was developed by changing the structure of a virus. The cure was heralded throughout the world until the virus begins to mutate and begins a plague. New York City is quarantined, but Neville stays behind in an attempt to find a cure. Years later, except for his faithful dog, he is still alone. He spends his days hunting for survivors, gathering supplies, and trying to find a cure. But that's only during the day. Before evening, he returns to his home and barricades himself in for the night. For at night, the people that have been infected by the plague and are still alive come out of hiding, seeking for flesh to eat and blood to drink. These mutated zombie-vampires are hungry and not only want to find Neville to eat him, but to seek vengeance for what they have become. As the movie unfolds, it becomes a cat and mouse race as Neville attempts to outwit the creatures and find a cure before they find his home and destroy humanity's only hope.

I AM LEGEND is loosely based upon the classic vampire short story of the same name by Richard Matheson. Other than the main character's name and the general exposition of the plot, I AM LEGEND is unlike the original story. Fans of the story (myself included) might be disappointed by the adaptation. Yet, despite straying from the source material, I AM LEGEND works really well as movie in its own right. The ending of the film does seem rushed and is very different from the ending of the story, yet the overall spirit of the book is intact and the ending of the film makes it clear that Robert Neville is a hero to be admired, a legend.

I enjoyed I AM LEGEND. Will Smith is a very talented actor and I usually enjoy watching him on screen. I really liked Richard Matheson's original story, and though I was disappointed by certain aspects of the book's latest adaptation, I thought the filmmakers did a great job in making a good and solid movie that stays true to the spirit of the original story. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of the film that was composed of almost entirely Bob Marley music.

Meaning it's the end of the world, and either there is one survivor or a few, but the results are the same...people really discovering how to survive during the end of days. Ex-Military researcher, Nevell is apparently immune to the very real vampire-like virus that has completely devastated New York City (in the future). Alone with no one but his dog (his wife and daughter were killed), and a variety of strategically placed mannequins, Nevell appears to be handling solitude, as anyone would (with a touch of madness). In a city filled with deer, wild animals (they obviously got out of the Zoo), Nevell spends his days hunting those that are ill, and his nights hiding out in his well fortified home. Unfortunately, things change as we see other survivors and the very beings that Nevell thought were so unintelligent (and without meaningful brain activity) being more intelligent (well at least the leader) than first believed.

I enjoyed this story, although I wasn't particularly fond of the ending. I think that in a time of great despair and hopelessness, we see a man that was able to survive, with his sanity (well not exactly) and his sense of purpose.

The movie is not an ""action flick"", this is not ""Die Hard"", its a drama. It follows ""the last man on earth"" and shows how he gets himself through life with no one around. It tries to answer questions like; How does he feed himself? What does he do with his time? Why is he the last one left? Will Smith delivers one of the best performances he has given, putting him on par with the likes of Denzel Washington (thats right).

This movie is not for the person who's favorite movie is ""The Fast And The Furious""(I do like that movie though). But it is for someone looking for a movie that will draw you in and tug on your emotions. For me, this movie was intense, emotional, exciting, and dramatic.

1604669,4,B00005JPTK,"I saw this movie in the theater last year, and didn't know what to expect. I hadn't read the book (at the time) and didn't know what the movie was about. After seeing the trailer, I thought that it was something like Jumanji with all the animals running amok.

  I admit that the CGI in I Am Legend is amazing. However, the ""zombie"" appears somewhat cartoonish, like a tall Gollum but wearing modern clothing. The enviroment looks great with all the overgrown plants and semi-demolished buildings. The bombing of the Brooklyn Bridge was sweet, also.

  Now the story. It was okay, nothing like the book at all.

(Spoiler). Basically Neville walks around the city for a three years with his dog, ""Sam"" and basically hunts zombies with his assault rifle. His dog got bitten, got infected, he killed it, he got mad the zombies, started mowing them down with his car, topples over, than gets saved by a woman. The woman lives with him in the house, it gets raided by zombies, Neville found the cure at that exact moment, and blows himself up.(End of spoiler)

  Pretty much, the story adds more beef to itself by adding irrelevant scenes. For example, the shrek scene took about 5 minutes. Neville wandering around at the video store talking to mannequiens, him playing golf, and chasing deer around. The story ended with a bad ending, finding the cure at the very last minute and blowing himself up and the zombies to let the girl get away. In short, the story was considerably weak.

  Here are the things that make no sense.
1. Neville is immune to the disease but doesn't do anything about it.
2. The girl dresses up and is pretty hot but this is a time of crisis.
3. No corpses on the street?
4. Nevile fond the cure at the last minute.
5. It's New York, there are other ways to leave the city.
6. Unlike most epidemic movies, they simply destroythe bridge instead of nuking the place.
7. Male zombies wear shorts only but females were that and bras. Wow, zombies have dress codes?
8. Neville killed himself when he could have chucked the grenade to the zombies and then run away.

  I thought Will Smith was a great actor and the dog did pretty well too. But the director probably only read the first chapter of the book. The movie ended so abruptly, you'd think the directors said ""Okay people, that's the budget, let's go home.""

1604674,4,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend can't get a fair shake.  This Will Smith-led production is the third attempt Hollywood has made to adapt the brilliant novel.  None of the adaptions have truly done the novel justice (which is a shame), but this version has come the closest.

Here we have a brilliant beginning; footage of a scientist (played beautifully by Emma Thompson) saying humbly that she's discovered a way to cure cancer.  Fast forward a few years, and New York is utterly devoid of human life, save for Robert Neville (Will Smith).  As the first half of the film progresses, we learn about his meager living, spending the day harvesting and trying to discover a cure, even now, while spending the night huddled in his protected home as creatures prowl.

His only companion, a wonderful dog named Sam, protects Neville as Neville protects him.  They have a friendship based on loneliness and the human need for someone or something to hold onto.  Sam is Neville's only connection to the past and the only way to represent what little humanity is left, either in the world or Neville himself.  This period in the movie is pitch perfect, puncuated by one or two terrifying sequences that instill genuine horror.

Unfortunately, the last half of the film deteriorates into an action movie that completely changes the meaning of the words ""I Am Legend.""  Don't get me wrong, it's mostly done really well.  Constantine director Francis Lawrence has a good handle on the action and delivers some good scenes.  But, it becomes muddled and veers off completely from the novel.  My biggest complaint, though, is the use of CGI.  Instead of using real flesh and blood actors, all of the creatures are created with CG and they look incredibly fake when lined up next to real people.  In the beginning, it's not a problem but as you see more of them (and you will) it's glaringly obvious.  And annoying.

All of this I was expecting going in, though.  Considering that the film was co-written by Akiva Goldsman who also wrote I, Robot, I knew this version would stray from the source material just as I, Robot did.  As a movie, it's genuinely thrilling and creates the perfect balance of tension and action through most of its entirety.  And, surprisingly, Will Smith shows that he's a really good actor as he has to not only tackle many conflicting emotions during the two hour run time but he also has to do so without having much of anyone to react to.  Spending a good hour or so without another single actor for Will Smith to work with was a gamble and it paid off.

Your enjoyment of the film is entirely based on what you bring to the table.  If you're coming to this film expecting to see the book come to life you'll be sorely disappointed.  However, if you're looking for a good action movie that actually has a good story and a human aspect, you'll be hard-pressed to find one as thrilling recently.",1203897600,84,2886,4.644970414201183

There is something deliciously horrible to watch our cities being destroyed in the movies. It is like a guilty pleasure. Some uncontrollable curiosity that leaves us in awe before the unusual. It may be looking at a car accident as we drive by or watching New York City being destroyed by the sea in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Impact-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002V7OI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, by a monster in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield-Theatrical-Release/dp/B00005JPXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield [Theatrical Release</a>] or by the ultimate storm in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After-Tomorrow-Two-Disc-All-Access-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0007PALRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After Tomorrow (Two-Disc All-Access Collector's Edition)</a>. It is a pleasure to see the impossible happen with the visual accuracy of certainty while deep inside we know it only lasts for two hours.

I AM LEGEND gives you that guilty pleasure... with a twist: the city is not really destroyed. It is Humans who are absent after a deadly disease has wiped us out. And after that, Nature starts to reclaim the Earth. In fact, one of the most powerful images of this film is in the beginning, when Dr. Neville (Smith) drives a Mustang across the city and gets surprised by deers running scared through the streets on Manhattan. Even more disturbing is to see Dr. Neville moving across the woods in Times Square (no less) as he hunts one of them.

This is just one of I AM LEGEND's greatest achievements: it really gives us a world (through state-of-the-art visual effects) unseen, unimaginable, fascinating... and lets you explore it. We know there are vampires (or some creatures like that running havoc through the night). But during daytime, we go places and see things we'll never see. And that's pure film magic.

So here is the story: Dr. Robert Neville lives alone in Manhattan as the sole survivor to a deadly virus (to which he is immune) who transformed everybody in light-sensitive vampire-like monsters (forced to live in the dark). The crisis (shown in flashbacks as he recollects) happened a few years ago and - right now - Dr. Neville is on the verge of loosing his mind. He talks to mannequins, watches recorded television broadcast and try to have a normal life (with his dog Samantha) hoping to make contact with other survivors like himself. Oh... and he is a military scientist trying to find a cure.

Now... it is a ridiculous effort to compare the film to the book, as this film is much more a loose adaptation of Richard Matheson's great novella. This film uses the same premise but makes significant changes in key elements that (I believe) would never really work on a Hollywood blockbuster. So, those who love the novella and hate the film should realize that, many many times, the film's preoccupations and objectives are not the same ones we have on the books they are based on. It is important to appreciate the film in its own merit and outside the burden of the book - a burden any film wants to break free from. Gone are the days where a Hollywood film ""wanted to be the book"" because they needed such blessing from such an authority.

And breaking down the film's great assets, we'll find only positive elements: Will Smith's very precise performance, a screenplay who tell you the story minute by minute maintaining you always wanting more, great special effects, great scary moments that will please its target audience... and the city we love being engulfed by a destiny without us.

Simply beautiful.

This DVD version comes with lots of extras, the best of which, in my opinion, is the making of the city's visuals we see throughout the entire movie. Also, it comes with an alternate version of the film with a different ending that would never hit the audience in the same way. Fascinating.

The film is not perfect. There are one or two less interesting elements that I will not delve into because I believe they are a matter of taste. And regardless of that, I think this film is a production triumph in contemporary cinema.

1604833,3,B00005JPTK,"There are a few sublime moments in ""I Am Legend"" that make you realize just how amazing a science fiction film can be. The genre has long been my favorite, and even though this isn't a sci-fi film in the strictest sense of the term, it has shades of the genre all through it.

Prime moments include Will Smith entering a dark building in search of his dog, and then battling with monsters he never knew existed (literally). There is one particularly effective scene, where Will Smith knows that his dog has been 'infected', watches his dog turn into a monster before his eyes, and then kills it with his bare hands. The entire sequence plays out like a subdued exercise in human tolerance and reaction - and it was carried out superbly by Will Smith.

In fact, it is Smiths' amazing screen presence and top-notch acting ability that makes this film as good as it is. However, he is let down by a very weak script, a nonsensical ending, and is paired opposite a tepid actress in the second half who reduces the film to a parody of itself. My primary problem with the second half is that it entirely undid all the solemn promise the first half did. The climax is a huge group of monsters (very poor CGI here) trying to attack Smith, who in turn destroys himself and the facility so that the monsters perish as well. This 'Save the World' sentiment has been overdone in way too many Hollywood films, and it just didn't work here.

The best parts of 'I Am Legend' are when it slows down to a quiet, sombre pace. The first hour, with its languid passages of just Will Smith walking and bonding with his dog are the most poignant, and the most real. This is a one-man movie, and its a pity that when it moves away from that, it doesn't work. By no means a classic, or even a 'very good film', but this is one movie well worth watching - it could have been much, much worse.

'I Am Legend' definitely had its good points - Will Smith was excellent, as always, and the overall production design was incredible.  The whole 'look and feel' of NYC three years after a virus wiped out the entire human population was quite well done. However, the overall story line and relatively thin plot left me wanting something more, and the abrupt ending was unfulfilling. 3.5 stars.",1203379200,,543,4.587628865979381
1604835,3,B00005JPTK,"I am Legend' s point of departure remits us immediately to ""Planet of the apes"" , ""28 days later""  with a devastating Manhattan (the most cosmopolite city in the world) and a warrior of the road, the only survivor in many miles away, (whose only friend is his almost human pet Sam, whose expressiveness equals it with the sympathetic dog in ""As good as it gets"")

The film reconstructs the previous moments to the global catastrophe, the origin of the messy and chaos that led this apocalyptic ambiance.

But since the middle of the story, one feels the plot simply weakens itself more and more; common places, edition problems and sudden alterations of a well planned script simply collapsed with a predictable final and a lack of that crucial dramatic punch.

A fabulous idea that stranded in the middle of the river. Perhaps, in hands of veterans directors of this genre (David Cronenberg or John Carpenter) , the overcome would have been by far, quite succesful",1202947200,,965,4.795180722891566
1604836,3,B00005JPTK,"Of the three films based on the novel by Richard Matheson, the newest I AM LEGEND ranks as the middle.  In the first, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH,  Vincent Price used his unique ability to make the audience feel his pain as he often writhed in agony in a sea of goo. In the second, THE OMEGA MAN, Charlton Heston played the straight man to a horde of glowing eyed hippies all of whom favored the flowing robes associated with cinematic free love communes. Will Smith completes the trifecta with I AM LEGEND that has less to do with Matheson's novel and more to do with a series of philosophical conundrums that simmer beneath the assigned text.

The plot is well know to anyone who has seen any of its twin predecessors. New York City (and presumably much of the world) has been hit with a plague that started out as a cure devised by Emma Thompson in a surprisingly minor role. The cure mutates such that its victims morph into a race of computer-generated pseudo-humans that we have seen before, most recently as the Morlocks in the revised THE TIME MACHINE. Smith as Dr. Robert Neville and his dog have to survive as he seeks a cure.  The most interesting part of the film is the first half.  The stunning scenes of a deserted and decrepit Manhattan form a subtext that reminds one of the recent book THE WORLD WITHOUT US. What would happen to man's mightiest works of art, of architecture, and of general accomplishment if man himself should vanish? The result would be a creepy sense that humanity is like a temporary boil on the butt of this planet that would soon enough shake off all evidence that we once walked the cobbled streets as the Lords of Creation. The pace of the first half is slow and rightfully slow.  Smith walks the streets of New York and sees a muted civilization crumbling even as a jungle reaches out to reclaim its own.  Smith plays Neville as a man hurt by his inability to find a cure. He dares to allow the audience to feel his isolation as he walks in and out of a video store seeking companionship from a few mannikins. The pace of the second half soon switches from static to kinetic.  Action abounds with mutated dogs and wall-crawling freaky zombies making the movie more of a mind-numbing but less interesting actioner that seeks to find a cure for the plague. The only problem was that the computer-enhanced scenes of morphed humans become the focal point of audience interest, and after a while, that audience soon realizes that except for the one mutate who seems to be the leader, that one mutate is pretty much like any other.  For a comparison about how to keep a crumbling civilization film on track, one need only look at how Vincent Price used the force of his personality and at a fraction of the cost. Here Smith tries mightily to be the dramatic center, but his attempt was doomed by over-eager technical wizards who have proved for the umpteenth time that new-fangled wizardry will never trump the ability of an actor to dominate a scene or an entire film with his voice and twisting body.  I suspect that there will be plenty of viewers who will gladly pay to see I AM LEGEND one time, but once having done so, will refrain from watching this latest version and will happily tune in late at night to watch how Vincent Price gets the job done.",1202601600,2,3288,4.492462311557789

Excellent acting by Smith (as always), great screenplay and computer generation for the most part, ""I Am Legend"" simply flows and differs from typical films of the genre in that it is elegant and classy.

There is much to enjoy here.  An empty NYC slowly being reclaimed by nature is perfectly evoked, and Smith is excellent as the lonely man trying to hang on to his life and his sanity long enough to achieve his goal.

The early sections of the film are the best.  Director Francis Lawrence and writers Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman establish the mutated survivors as a truly terrifying, unstoppable presence, most notably in a frightening sequence in which Neville enters their lair to look for his dog.  However, they lose their sense of menace in direct proportion to the amount of screen time they get, no doubt due to the fact that they are realized through CGI rather than practical make-up effects.  This is a rather large flaw in a film that gets so many other things right.  I was not disappointed in the finale, as so many other reviewers were, but perhaps this is because I have not yet read the Richard Matheson source material.",1202342400,,1181,4.703883495145631

As cinema, the movie makes for a great character piece. Where Tom Keogh believes that Will Smith's Dr. Neville becomes too messianic in the end, I feel that it is more indicative of the loss of self and the need for purpose that any intelligent man may face in the loss of all things human. The need to serve that purpose, to keep the world from ending, and psychologically keep the events beyond his control from happening, are a representation of the battle the character's psyche goes through every single day. This is a continually renewed battle, which he wins against every single day, until later in the film, when he suffers another, equally significant loss (specifics omitted, this is not a spoiler). All in all, having seen nothing save an early teaser trailer, this movie came to me as a great surprise. My expectations were not set going in to see the movie, but found an excellent character piece with some great acting and visual effects. Some might classify it as not being a true piece of cinema, due to some science fiction themes, though I find that such a classification does not do the film justice.",1202256000,2,1259,4.5506607929515415

GOOD: Will Smith's acting for the most part, the dog's ""acting"", most CG of deserted NYC, the interior ""decorating"" of Smith's hideaway, the idea that the mutants can adapt and hunt Smith's character creatively, maybe the wardrobe.

BAD: 101 minutes for $16 bucks!!, the CG for everything else, almost all of the dialogue, the other characters aside from Smith's, the rushed ridiculous ending, the lack of developing dramatic tension with the ""mutant leader"", the non-sensical / illogical plot happenings, shameless product placement as per usual, the location and structure of Smith's hideaway (an old house on the ground in a central location with pretty flimsy protection - look at the front door for crying out loud!).

Indeed, the glaring awfulness of the computer-rendered deer is enough to make you forget all about the beautiful post-plague New York cityscapes (in themselves worthy of huge praise, they're chilling and very impressive), the thitherto-great performance by Smith as a man hounded by loneliness and personal demons, and the very cute Alsatian by his side.

But with further viewing, ""I Am Legend"" becomes much, much better - for the most part - and is, by the time the credits roll, not Just Another Action Movie, but something more enjoyable - if two-dimensional.

The Good: Smith gives a gorgeous, nuanced performance as plague survivor Robert Neville - when he's allowed to act, that is. When he's forced to shoot, run, chase, do action - he reverts to a horrible sort of MIB stereotype - but during Robert Neville's more emotionally complex scenes he's actually excellent. Director Francis Lawerence does great things with the aforementioned bare New York of the future, and we can really sense the isolation and loneliness of Neville's plight. And yes, there are several worthwhile ""jump"" moments, too, with which to keep the action moving along nicely. It's just a shame that most of the action is hackneyed - which leads me to

The Bad: Boring chase & evade sequences and frankly ridiculous computer animations (the animals are a minor offender: the crown of stupidity in this case belongs squarely planted on the heads of the totally unrealistic, poorly-animated Zombies) ruin the great work of Smith and his director in ""I Am Legend"". Also, the ending is very hackneyed - I'm not sure if it's reflective of the novel since I haven't read it - but as a movie, we've seen it all before.

Still, criticisms notwithstanding, ""I Am Legend"" is a worthwhile way to pass an evening's viewing: I wouldn't buy the DVD because no amount of extras could make up for the fact that, while enjoyable enough with all-too-brief moments of excellence, ""I Am Legend"" is just not engaging enough to watch twice.",1201651200,,2283,4.846153846153846

For the first 2/3'rds of the movie, it's very affecting. Dr Neville (Smith) and dog Sam prowl an abandoned Manhattan, sharing the space with deer, lions and other critters.

It's those other critters that amp up the middle of the movie, as Smith does a major boo-boo and grabs a female zombie-mutant plague victim who happens to be best gal pal to the alpha zombie. Seems Dr Neville needs to run tests on muties if he will find a cure and save mankind, yet for some romantic reason, alpha zombie wants his baby back. This conflict made for the best part of ""I Am Legend,"" but the film did not have the good sense to leave it at that. After three years alone with the dark-seekers, another pair of real live humans make it to NYC, and then the film stumbles.

I won't go beyond this point, because all other plotlines follow from that moment. What was a strong lead character to this point suddenly gets muddled up, and all the cool CGI in the world can't make drama from stale pudding. However, for the scenes of Smith grooving on Bob Marley and the meditation on ""Shrek,"" this is a pretty good mid-level Science Fiction movie.

1604981,3,B00005JPTK,"This is a good Will Smith movie, but as the latest adaptation of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, it disappoints. Some effort goes into the psychological aspect and survival strategy, but not deep enough to create the philosophical MacGyver that Robert Neville should be. Blame this partly on the casting. Smith is wrong for the role: he's not believable as a Colonel or a top scientist, or ultimately a father figure. Denzel Washington or even Nicolas Cage would have been far better Robert Nevilles. Another problem Will Smith brings is his fan base includes very young kids. As I sat in the theater, an entire group of third graders trouped in to watch the movie. They weren't actively disruptive, but they laughed at the wrong things. However, they bought tickets and made the Movie Moguls happy. Personally, I would find sitting through Shrek long enough to learn the lines, a hell worse than being eaten by the zombie-things, but I'm sure it delighted the young-uns. One aspect I may have shared with the kids was I thought, no holds barred, the dog is the best part of the movie. So much, that I would have given anything if when the other survivor-lady shows up and admires the picture of his daughter (with dog) and she comments on how pretty she is and who is she, couldn't Will have responded, ""oh that's Samantha!"" I mean, he's been bonding with the dog for years now. It would have seemed appropriate.
I was really looking forward to this pic since I'm a fan of it's other two incarnations, and I admit it was good, but not as good as it could have been if you're familiar with the story. It's disappointing they have yet to make a really good adaptation of this great idea.",1200528000,,1686,4.604651162790698

Robert Neville is almost literally the last man left on Earth.  Through some bizarre fluke, he's one of only a handful of people with a natural immunity to a virus that, in less than three years time, has denuded the world of most of its human population.  Now, Neville, a renowned virologist himself, spends his days cruising the streets of a deserted Manhattan, and his nights hiding out from the infected cannibalistic mutants who venture forth only after dark (shades of ""The Time Machine,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" and dozens of other similar films).

""I Am Legend"" is just the latest film version of the 1954 Richard Matheson novel that also served as the basis for 1971's ""The Omega Man,"" with Charlton Heston in the lead role.  Despite its occasional feeling of over-familiarity, ""I Am Legend,"" is a generally more subtle and thoughtful work than the average sci-fi film, one that, in addition to its more conventional action sequences and flesh-eating monsters, explores themes like survivors' guilt and the effect of prolonged isolation on the human psyche.  The movie, however, is clearly most notable for its remarkably convincing vision of a desolate, post-apocalyptic New York City, where weeds grow promiscuously through holes in the pavement and uninhabited buildings and idle cars serve as ghostly reminders of a civilization now gone from the scene (though one questions whether the place would really look quite this shoddy a mere three years after its abandonment).  Kudos to director Francis Lawrence and his crack team of visual and special effects artists for so successfully bringing this concept to life on screen.  For the most part, the thrills are nicely balanced with moments of tender sentiment, as Neville reflects back on the time he had with his late wife and daughter.

In a role reminiscent of Tom Hanks' in ""Cast Away,"" Will Smith, largely bereft of any human companionship, spends most of the movie talking either to himself or to Sam, his loyal German Shepherd.  In this setup, Smith once again demonstrates that he is definitely a commanding presence on screen, keeping us interested even in those moments when not much is actually happening in the story.  For, there is, admittedly, a trifle more downtime in the movie than many of the more hardcore action fans would probably like.  That objection aside, however, ""I Am Legend"" provides enough food for thought and a sufficient number of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills to make it worth watching.",1200441600,,2495,5.058536585365854

Well, first few minutes, I was entertained to see NY becoming a jungle. No people, cars just parked, overgrown by weeds. What a sight. Right until the lone man found something disturbing....

Since my partner loves RE (and I was forced to watch obviously), I could not help to compare the 2 movies. I think this movie is similar to RE and there was just nothing new. I also think the director didn't think of the ending scene very much. Listening to its description, I was imagining a totally different kind of place.

1604984,4,B00005JPTK,"I'm not much of a Will Smith fan anymore, but when I saw the previews for ""I Am Legend"" in the movie theater, this was a concept I had to see. Something about a man standing alone in a terrorized, deserted city had me. The computer effects of this film in regards to re-creating New York City is fantastic. I have also read that they actually shut down and closed off street locations for re-dressing and filming, for example, adding the grass and abandoned cars.
  This film reflects The Last Man on Earth (1964), starring Vincent Price, The Omega Man (1971) starring Charlton Heston and every other zombie movie and video game we have ever played. This film also made me think of Logan's Run.
  ""Robert Neville"" (Will Smith) is the last human man alive in New York City in 2009. It is just him and his dog, Sam.  The city is totally deserted due to a virus and human warfare. The city has not been maintained, so of course, remains of the mayhem still exist and grass and weeds have overtaken some roads. Deer also run freely with a lion also on the loose. These zoo animals are only seen in the daytime. Robert is safe in the daytime and has the entire city to drive in for himself. As long as he stays outside in the sun or inside his own apartment, him and his dog are fine. However, when nighttime falls, it is dangerous for Robert. Find out why.
  This film was only good enough to see once.  Unless the DVD version has bonus footage within the film and an alternate ending, I most likely will not see it again.

1604986,3,B00005JPTK,"By far my dumbest review title, but it gets to the point.  What's the point?  Every time civilization is engulfed in some sort of cannibalistic, zombie-esque plague many questions get begged and then I fail to enjoy the movie.  I hate it when I ruin movies with logic.  I have much more fun when I can let things go.  Unfortunately for me and my wife reality reared its ugly head while watching this film.  Fortunately for the movie, reality does not make it a bad film.  What am I getting at anyway!!?  To save all of us some time, here is a list of bullet statements to explain my problematic reality check of civilizations end (again):

(Some of this might be considered ""spoiler"" material so consider yourself warned)
-Why do plagues always turn people into cannibals?  And when they turn into cannibals, why don't they eat each other?  In this film the plague-ridden are maniacal, night dwelling blood suckers.  Don't any of them have blood in their bodies to share?

-If animals get said plague, as is the case in this film, why would they not try to eat their plague infected masters?  If the plague turns people into animals does it turn animals into... ...more animals??  I guess we should assume that getting the plague and going nuts ends all bigotry and discrimination not only between races, but also species.  If you have the plague you're cool.  If you don't you're dinner.  Hey, another upside to getting the plague!

-In real life a plague weakens and kills people. In movies often the plague that ends civilization turns people into super beings.  Not such a bad deal really.  If I could run like the wind, scamper up walls like a squirrel, knock over cars by running into them and endure copious amounts of pain I'd consider taking up the plague voluntarily and become a superhero.  Of course I'd need to work around that urge to eat my fellow man.

-Do the infected reproduce (am I nuts or am I the only one in the theater thinking about this stuff?)?  I mean, if they don't do ""the act"" aren't they going to disappear after a couple of generations?  If they do commit ""the act"" do the female plaguies eat the male plaguies when they're done?  I know the zombies don't do it, but you never run out of dead people.  Although, at some point after everyone is a zombie, there is going to be a big rot-fest and everyone will just fall to pieces.  Don't want to be there for that.  In ""28 days later"" people eventually die of the plague, so that works out nicely.

-Since plaguies are crazed animals (sort of) and they don't really do anything but hunt for food and since they don't eat each other, wouldn't they eventually run out of food?  What happens when they eat all the healthy people and animals (Whom they greatly outnumber btw)?  Since they don't eat members of the club, this presents a problem.

-Are the plague-ridden impervious to extremes in temperature?  Since they seem to have lost most capacity for manufacturing and electricity is becoming a distant memory, how will they stay warm in the winter?  They run around in rags with nothing on their feet, so finding new cloths seems a low priority. Do they migrate?  Hardly seems likely with that inconvenient allergy to UV light.  They do have a high metabolic rate so maybe that helps.  But, without fur covering there skin, it is more than likely that northern Plaguies would eventually die off due to exposure and cold.

-Why do plaguies suddenly have the ability to stretch their facial bones every time they want to yell out with an attack scream?  This is kind of a rip-off from ""The Mummy"" movie and really looked fake and out of place in this movie.  I liked it in ""The Mummy"" because that was pure fantasy.  This is sci-fi and it didn't look right.  Using CG was OK for everything else because of the superpowers plaguies possess.  I just don't understand why their jaws needed to stretch.

-Does immunity to a zombiesque plague cause you to lose your mind or miss the obvious?  At a crucial point of the movie, we learn that Will is not the sole survivor (a woman and her son pop in).  The woman insists that there are more survivors in a nearby colony.  Will insists there is no one else (boy, does he miss the obvious).  When Will asks the woman why she believes there are more survivors she tells him (paraphrase) ""God says so."".  WHAAAA?!?!  She really does not get fact-based debate.  The correct and obvious answer should have been ""We're here, aren't we?""  Both people missed the most obvious things and that's just not what real people do.

-Do any of us want a future with Will Smith in it?  The prospects are bleak; Alien invasion wiping out most of humanity.  Robot rebellion.  Plague infested world full of vampires.  I pick the robots.

In the Chuck Hesston version ""Omega Man"", the plague victims become cult members.  Never is cannibalism ever mentioned.  They simply want to get Chuck because he's not one of them and he wants to ""cure"" who they are.  That makes things a lot more feasible in the long run.  ""I Am Legend"" makes a similar point.  He treats the plaguies like animals (a reputation well earned) and subsequently becomes their enemy.  In the end, there are questions who the bad guy is (at least I thought so).

 There are plenty of tense and scary scenes in which Will Smith does a great job.  A very well made movie that beg lots of silly questions from one silly guy.  These questions kind of ruined the movie for me though.  I would actually recommend avoiding at the theater and buying on DVD.  Theaters are just too expensive these days and there is little advantage to seeing it on the big screen.  Overall a fun movie but you will need to stop asking so many goofy questions if you want to enjoy it.",1200268800,11,5727,4.539666993143976
1604987,4,B00005JPTK,"Hollywood takes the haunting and original 1955 science fiction novel by Richard Matheson and turns it into a horror movie--a good horror move but horror nonetheless.  Indeed this is what all such movies would be if they had great actors, good writing, a plot and a real budget.  I just wish they had called it something other than I Am Legend.

The novel had roots in science fiction and forged new ground with the vampire genre and it spawned dozens of other books and two movies inspired directly by it,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B000WC3A0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Man/dp/B000P0J0BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Man</a>.  As with these adaptations, very little of the original novel remains in this latest movie.

However, I asked myself if I would have enjoyed the movie if I had never read the book.  Yes, I would have.  This is not great cinema, but in the horror genre it ranks high.  Most of the CGI was excellent.  The scenes of a bleak and uninhabited New York were compelling and Will Smith is a superior actor.  The trepidation during the scenes in the dark warehouse and as the vampires attacked his home were real for me.

The movie is a passing entertainment.  The book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765318741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>, remains original and haunting.  I found myself thinking of the novel days after I read it.  The book is five stars.  This movie which, as I said, is only loosely inspired by the book I give four stars.  If the movie had not claimed the mantle of Matheson's novel I might have given it five stars.

Recommendation:  This is a horror movie where monsters lurk in dark places and inhabit the night seeking to kill people.  I cannot recommend it for pre-teens.  But for the rest of us, if you like the genre and don't mind how they have distorted Matheson's novel, this is an entertaining movie.

Most people now look at that film as 70's camp, but frankly I liked it for what it was, which is why i looked forward to this film, I liked the idea of Will Smith taking the role and the move to NYC as the location.  The first half of the movie rocked, id give it five stars, but the second half and the fact that the CGI vampires didn't work at all, forced an overall three star rating.  Smith is very good in this, frankly I think he is way better by himself than when bouncing off of other actors, I think this is his best role since Ali, if only the CGI team had been up to his level.

1604989,4,B00005JPTK,"In 2009, a vaccine for cancer caused a virus that turned nearly all of the people on earth into rabid, blood-thirsty, zombies.  It is now 2012, and as far as Robert Neville (Will Smith) knows, he and his trusty dog are the only uninfected creatures in New York City.  He spends his days watching DVDs, driving the deserted streets hunting for deer, and working in his laboratory, trying to find a cure for this horrible virus.  No matter what, he has to be home by sundown, because that's when the zombies come out.

I like Will Smith a lot and here he gives a somber yet powerful performance that tugs at your heartstrings and has you rooting for him.  He and his dog make a very likeable team and they make the movie.  I don't like films that over-do the CGI stuff - I think it makes then too cartoony - and, unfortunately, this movie is loaded with it.  The blown-up  bridges and deserted, weedy streets of New York are too obviously fake, and the zombies, while repulsive and frightening, are poorly done and never looked real.

The unoriginal script and suspense factor were worth about three stars, while Smith's performance earned five stars, so I give it four stars; intriguing and sometimes intense, but not really thrilling, due to bad computer images and because the last-man-on-earth plot has been done before (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Man/dp/B000VAHR1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Man</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B000WC3A0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>).",1199923200,,1640,5.661224489795918
1604990,3,B00005JPTK,"OK, here's the deal. I never read the book, I didn't care about the plot or who was acting, I just wanted to see how the movie depicted post-apocalyptic New York. I'm probably a bit older than a lot of posters so my visual acuity may leave something to be desired, but I enjoyed the scenes of a weed-covered, delapidated, once-great city. Then I found myself enjoying Will Smith's acting. Then I found myself interested in the plot. Had fun cringing as the vampirical mutants menaced the last remnants of civilization.
But then...(SPOILER ALERT)...

The Brazilian lady and the boy showed up. Right there and then, the whole thing tanked. They were totally out of place and completely interrupted the flow of the film. What really got me was the conversation where the woman keeps insisting there's a survivor colony in Vermont, and Legend keeps telling her that's crazy. Finally he says: ""How do you know there's *anything* left anywhere at all?"" [paraphrase].

Her: ""God told me.""
Me: ""WTF????""

That was just so all wrong. First we're in a post-Armageddon, deserted wasteland, devoid of all hope, then we're watching an episode of *The 700 Club*? What's wrong with that picture? What's even wronger is that Legend ends up believing the Deity-channeling woman, and that she somehow knows without a map just how to get to the survivor colony. C'mon, how much more contrived and heavy-handed could you get? That just blew it all to H3ll for me. Nothing seemed believable after the woman and boy showed up. That's unfortunate because the beginning of the movie had a lot of promise. I would rent the DVD to watch with someone who'd never seen it, but I wouldn't buy it, and I'd have to attach a lot of caveats to recommend it to a friend. Next time someone does a remake, I hope they leave the religious claptrap out of it. It would have been a much sharper, more focused movie without it.",1199923200,3,1887,4.694864048338369
1605031,1,B00005JPTK,"The three memorable things about this dead-in-the-water adaptation of a classic science-fiction novel is that it stars a charismatic black actor, the only other survivor in the story is an ethnic South American woman, and the 'baddie', so to speak, is a WASP doctor. That's pretty subversive stuff for Hollywood. Unfortunately, the rest of the film does not live up to expectations. It is an empty CGI extravaganza that possesses not an ounce of genuine emotion. Most distressing of all, it takes the highly ironic title of the novel and turns it into an unconvincing heroic final gesture. Like 'The Incredible Shrinking Man', 'I am Legend' is novel about loneliness and the insignificance of man in the vastness of the cosmos. In these two novels, Matheson is saying that man will not go out with a bang but a whimper, an unnoticed sigh. But that does not sit well with the noisy mentality of the blockbuster genre where noisy special effects attempt to fill the void and fail spectacularly.",1199923200,7,992,4.875739644970414
1605032,4,B00005JPTK,"Disappointing but not entirely invalid film follows Will Smith as a lone virologist named Robert Neville in a post-bacterial holocaust New York City in which he is the only one able to become the savior for what remains of the human race--the ""living"" are now called ""dark seekers"", mutated, rabies-infected fiends who go on the prowl for blood at night, and of course their ""attacker"", Mister Neville. What follows is half-brilliant and half-delusional filmmaking, but all in all it is an entertaining ride and not as bad (in context) as come of its harshest critics have noted.
What strikes a viewer most strongly is how much this post-9/11 allegory feels in terms of its heavy-handed spirit of loss; Smith's Neville is a far cry from the one in the Richard Matheson story, but that is/was a different story altogether so we can't use that as a measuring rod of this film's impact. Smith's Neville is not a loner by nature, and he genuinely feels like he is a part of the human race--in this film, it's a tragedy to lose the human population, separate from the feeling offered by the novel that bears this title. Also, there is a much more Evangelical Christian feel to the ending, a sense that humanity will always have a savior that is willing to sacrifice himself for humanity. I can see why a great deal of critics found this intolerable at the time, but in hindsight it's actually a more interesting picture to think about. The CGI ""infected"" creatures are actually terrible, both in conception and in their comic book-style execution, but it is Smith's rather intense performance that anchors the film instead. Some seemed to find the picture scary in many ways, but it is certainly lightweight in that area (at least for those who watch horror films) and it doesn't have the kind of harsh, misanthropic tone that most effective horror movies command. I seriously felt that director Francis Lawrence desired to make a mournful commentary upon the September 11th attacks, and he made the most of what was left over from the Ridley Scott/Mark Protosevich abandoned film that was never made (see the excellent book by David Hughes about the Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made). This feeling of mourning is aided much by James Newton Howard's light piano score. In short, ""I Am Legend"" is a Will Smith vehicle, and it is not a horror film really, which is why so many were upset by its ""adaptation."" But, for what it is, I enjoyed much that the picture had to offer--there is a great set piece that was kept from the original script that Scott was going to do, and that is when Smith chases his dog into the dark building where some nasty dark seekers await--this scene is genuinely suspenseful. So with all of the heavy spirit of Matheson's ideas bled out from this story, it is a lot more optimistic (or ""post-apocaloptimistic"") than a genuine vampire story would have been, looking as if all the heaviness in heart had been taken out and replaced with a kind of tragic accident story (I at first thought it was insulting to suggest that finding a cure for cancer would be a BAD thing, but this idea is never fully explained in the movie, so it's quite a put on really). The film is also simple in mind at points--Smith's character, for instance, listens to Bob Marley and quotes a populist singer, unlike Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man"", who quoted the dreary-minded and sexually deprived T. S. Eliot as a method of describing the remains of the human condition. And, I do vote for the Alternate Ending as being far better than the ridiculous one that was released into theaters--gosh that was silly. But the concept itself--and certainly the first half, as other critics have pointed out--is more involving than most other sf pictures have been as of late. Although somewhat disguised as an action movie, it becomes quite clear early on that ""I Am Legend"" is a drama film, ignoring an exploration of the pleasures of isolation by putting Smith's character on the breaking point as someone who cannot survive very well without eventual human contact. Interestingly enough, I may be interested in seeing what a studio makes out of Gary Graham's ""A Garden at the End of the World"" script (picked up from the Black List website/organization) if they so move to turn that script into a prequel to this movie.
Warner Brothers's two disc set understandably avoids giving any background to the years-in-production development process of ""I Am Legend"" from its early conceptual stages. What remains is an examination of the making of this movie, which is okay but offers nothing terribly revealing. The brief extra about the research done into the biology of what could occur during a plague outbreak in today's age is the most interesting feature, and certainly not in depth in any way. The audio commentary track (by Goldsman and director Lawrence) is nothing special at all. This one is mainly for Will Smith fans and people who still need more healing after the 9/11 tragedy, but visually (which is to say, cinematically) it offers a few interesting ideas.

Human culture, history is gone within 3 years. May it never happen. I feel the flashback technique that is used to tell parts of the story, failed to drive my interest. It should have been used more sparingly - Batman begins, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 are two examples where too many flashbacks only broke the continuity of their story lines. In Equilibrium, a brilliant movie, flashbacks were used more effectively to intensify dramatic moments.

1) Its not Mathesons story so to squeak in the ""this is his legend"" voice over bit at the end felt painful.
2) I didn't really need to see Will Smith doing pull ups half naked for such a long time.  In fact I didn't need to see it at all.
3) As a golfer, the scene with him hitting of a wing of a stealth bomber with no apparent grass matt was pretty damned dumb but so was speeding around the streets of NY.",1199577600,2,827,4.182389937106918

1605037,4,B00005JPTK,"Recently we went to see I Am Legend.

Based on a novel which I believe is of the same name, it tells the tale of a military doctor who is one of the few survivors of a plague, which has wiped out most of humanity, and turned most of the rest of the population into a pack of ravenous but daylight-fearing zombies. The doctor's manic mission is to find a cure for plague. He is on his own, except for his trusted dog, left behind by his family when they fled New York.

The doctor is played by Will Smith, and he has to carry most of the movie on his own. And carry it he does. He could have been manic or over-the-top, but he kept things reserved, showing the quiet warping of personality associated with imposed isolation for years.

The film isn't perfect. The zombies are too McGuffin-like, and the film feels a little shorter than it should have been as a result. Nevertheless, the movie was enjoyable, and provided some good scares too.",1199491200,,941,4.3352272727272725
1605038,4,B00005JPTK,"I am sure that most people have, at some time, considered what it would be like to be the last person on earth.  Surely, the benefits of complete freedom would be overwhelmed by the appalling loneliness.  It must be like solitary confinement without the walls.  And solitary confinement has been known to send its victims mad.

""I am Legend"" is a variance on the theme of the last man on earth.  Will Smith plays a modern day Robinson Crusoe alone within the decaying streets on Manhattan.  It is here that the film really is at its best.  The computer generated images of a ruined New York are remarkable.  There are weeds growing through the streets, deer roaming at will and even a pride of lions within this open air menagerie.

It is Smith's role in life to both find other living humans as well as finding a cure for the virus that has seemingly destroyed the human race.  Smith plays this part brilliantly.  He is dedicated to his task while assisted by his trusty dog.  He is a determined man but one who is nearing the brink as he talks to shop mannequins and seems inordinately lonely.

Around the half way point of the film, the viewer is introduced to some real objects of fear.  The virus that has wrought so much destruction on the human race has also led to the creation of a race of horrible mutants.  In this regard, I was reminded of HG Wells's ""The Time Machine"" where the Morlock live beneath the earth but come out at night to play on the peaceful Eloi.  With the use of modern cinematic techniques, these mutants can be made to be truly vile.

The film's conclusion was not entirely expected.  Suffice to say that Smith plays a hero.  His role in the film is quite stunning.  Overall, I enjoyed this film.  It had moments that grabbed the viewer's attention.  In fact, I might take a second viewing just to tidy up some loose ends.",1199491200,,1853,4.4523809523809526

The ending was completely different, and Robert Neville (who by the way was supposed to be pale with blonde hair and blue eyes...?) didn't have a dog! The dog was only in the book for one chapter. You can't even tell that the creatures in the movie are vampires!! What's up with that??

I went to see this movie with my boyfriend. He had never read the book, and he liked the movie. So I guess, for people who are too lazy to pick up a book and want instant gratification, you can sit and waste your time with this cheesy movie. Or you can read the book like it was supposed to happen. I swear, the producers of the movie must have read the back of the book and not even cracked it to see what it was about. What the hell?

99% of this movie is different from the book, to the extent they change Neville's family's names so he has a daughter named Marley, and he proceeds to launch into a big unneccessary speech about Bob Marley and peace on Earth. he is supposed to be the last man on Earth! How can there be peace if it's only one guy?? Or maybe better phrased, how can there be war?

The creatures are left to be guessed at. Are even they vampires? Nowhere do I see any blood-drinking, staking, or burning in sunlight which all appear in the novel. It absolutely disgusts me when movies are so completely different from books they are based on, and seemingly 'dumbed down' for the masses. A cure for cancer gone wrong...hmm, didn't seem that simple in the book. And what happened to his dead family? Oh and didn't the storyline only take place a few months after the extinction of all other humans? Not three years later? And -SPOILER- what's with the ending? Some crazy refugee camp? In the book the vamps started a new form of government! That was a cool twist and really made you think. The producers of this movie stripped I Am Legend of all its originality and made it into another cheap movie aimed at giving misunderstood goth kids something to talk about.

A piece of advice: DON'T read the book AND see the movie. Do one or the other. (I suggest reading the book.)",1199404800,2,2108,4.329113924050633

I thought I had seen the bottom of the Smith barrel when Jaden lit up the screen in last year's homeless but not hopeless saga THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, but I had not reckoned that Will would put little Willow into a movie where vampires smash into limo windows trying to eat her!  Well, better her than another more impressionable child actor I guess.  Is this how Peter and Jane Fonda started out, widenings in their dad's demographic?  The little white boy who arrives in the present day is nothing to write home about however.  They never did explain to me where he'd come from, just told him to keep shuffling his food across his plate, from one end to the other, over and over, in an attempt to suggest some of the post traumatic stress of spending whole days with Alice Braga, niece of veteran Brazilian bombshell Sonia Braga, sadly missed in these days of ""the next generation.""

More importantly the movie delivers plenty of action and suspense, till the last third where it all goes down the drain.  Director Francis Lawrence gets a wrenching performance out of his star, and the designers convincingly show us an apocalyptic and haunted, lonely New York, something Leonard Bernstein might have written symphonies about.

SPOILERS AHEAD.

Hate the emphasis on church in the picture, as the last reels dissolve into a debate between Will Smith and Alice Braga about does God exist or is He just an illusion or worse, out to get us.

It was all very well in THE VILLAGE, but why repeat it here in the closing shots of I AM LEGEND.  Why do we have to see that church steeple, is it supposed to make us feel, OK, we're in good hands now?  Even in THE NEW WORLD, when John Smith returns to Jamestown and sees everyone dying of hunger, the church steeple is broken and battered.  Do the vampires of I AM LEGEND respect crucifixes the way vampires in Hammer horror do?  I wonder.  Maybe something of this atavistic belief survives into the present era of post-28 DAYS LATER laterness.

1605131,4,B00005JPTK,"Back in 1954, Richard Matheson wrote a 'Legendary' novel that inspired many authors and film makers. Stephen King often gives partial credit to Matheson for his categorical success (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stephen-King-s-Danse-Macabre/dp/0425104338/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stephen King's Danse Macabre</a>). Three film adaptations have been made of this ""Legendary"" novel. None of the three have ever done the novel true justice. But the most recent adaptation of Matheson's novel called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765357151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>&nbsp;is perhaps the best movie of 2007.

It's no secret that 2007's I Am Legend centers around the exploits of Will Smith playing the last man on Earth. And Smith is absolutely phenomenal as this modern day (2009 - 2012) survivor; he deserves an award for his portrayal as Dr. Robert Neville. The movie runs for 101 minutes and Smith occupies the screen pretty much solo for about 3-quarters of the movie...but rest assured...he's not alone.

Fans of Matheson's novel should go into Director Francis Lawrence's 2007 film adaptation with an open mind. The key word is that this is an 'adaptation' inspired by the original novel. In fact, 2007's I Am Legend seems to not only be inspired by the novel, but also by the two prior film adaptations (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B000WC3A0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Man/dp/B000P0J0BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Man</a>; the 2007 film has elements of all three as well as some very cool original aspects.

Lawrence does an excellent job at keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with taught suspense. Smith keeps you captivated from start to finish. The story is terrific. The action scenes are very well done. But the superhuman abilities of the 'night seekers' is a bit hard to swallow.

In a nutshell, I look forward to the DVD release of I Am Legend, because I will certainly add it to my cart.

DVD RELEASE UPDATE - 3-20-2008 -- The DVD release of I Am Legend includes an alternate ending option to the theatrical release. Watch it. It is dubbed the ""controversal ending"", but it is actually more true to the theme of the original idea created by Matheson that the title of the story is derived from. Is Nevelle (Smith) a ""Legend"" for his work in science or is he a Legendary monster among the world's new society?",1199232000,,2645,6.005305039787799
1605132,5,B00005JPTK,"My standard for judging ""I Am Legend"" is not the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original-novel/dp/0765357151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original novel</a>&nbsp;by Richard Matheson but ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Man/dp/B000P0J0BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Man</a>.""  I watched the 1971 adaptation starring Charlton Heston last month in anticipation of going to see this new version, a master plan thwarted by classes not ending until December 21st this year.  I also tried to avoid hearing what other thought about this movie, but I did hear whispers about how the premise was great but that audiences were disappointed by the ending.  This might be an inevitable complaint about this story because after establishing the whole idea of being the last man on earth (a point hammered home in the omnipresent trailers for the film), the movie has to deal with the fact the hero is not the last man on Earth, albeit the last one living on the island of Manhattan.  If you think about what Will Smith's Robert Neville life has been like for the last three years, then what happens in this film represents a series of significant changes cascading through the end credits.

I think ""I Am Legend"" is way better than ""Omega Man,"" which is why its rating ends up being two stars better.  Director Francis Lawrence (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Constantine/dp/B0009MDPYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Constantine</a>"") has the advantage of the stunning transformation of New York City into a true urban jungle, while the screenplay by Mark Protosevich (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cell/dp/B00003CXKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cell</a>"") and Akiva Goldsman (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot/dp/B00005JN0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot</a>"") constructs a mixture of set pieces (e.g., Neville deer hunting), simple moments (e.g., Neville picking up a video), and flashbacks to the last time Neville say his wife and daughter.  The irony that a cure for cancer could turn into a plague that decimates the Earth is palatable (never trust a virus), and this time around Neville is a virologist, so he is still searching for a cure three years later.  The best parts of Smith's performance are done in silence; this might be a science fiction film but his work here is solid.  I also like the way things play out in the end, both in terms of the harsh reality of Neville's tenuous situation and also with regards to the psychology of the character that motivates his words and deeds during the end game.

There is no attempt to explain every thing that Neville is doing, which makes sense given that unless he is dictating a report in his lab the only other living thing he could talk to is his German shepherd Sam, and the need to explain everything to Sam passed long ago.  The plethora of zombie films in recent years, especially those that have decided zombies no longer lumber around but constantly sprint (to wit, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-the-Dead/dp/B00008G8L9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of the Dead</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later-28-Days-Later/dp/B000TJBN8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later""/""28 Days Later</a>"") might be misleading viewers into thinking the monsters in this one are zombie-like, but the specific evidence supplied in the film clearly indicates they are vampire-like.  One of the neat things I know about Matheson's novel was that he came up with scientific explanations for the key tenants of vampire lore, and I do wish those parts of the movie had been more explicit, but at least the film is consistent in leaving it to the audience to figure things out.

I have yet to see ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B000WC3A0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>,"" so it would be premature to say that ""I Am Legend"" is the best version of Matheson's novel, but the bottom line is that I was quite satisfied with this movie.  This is not to say that the film is perfect: when other humans show up it seems impossible, given the isolation of Manhattan and who the humans are, that they are able to get there and and do what they do.  But I round up on ""I Am Legend"" because it rings true that Smith's Neville would have slipped over the line into madness given the personal isolation and demons that have tormented him for three years.  His descent is tragic, which makes the resolution of this film so much more preferable to what happens with Heston's character in the other version.  Besides, I like Neville's taste in works of art to appropriate from MOMA.",1199145600,3,4922,5.90014064697609
1605133,4,B00005JPTK,"This is not a cheesy vampire/zombie flick.  I found it to be a thought provoking and frankly a frightening `what if' movie.

""I Am Legend"", is loosely based on Richard Matheson's 1954 short story of the same name.  Most of earth's population has perished due to a plague caused by a manmade virus, originally intended to cure cancer.  This manmade horror kills the majority of what it infects and what it doesn't kill it turns into devolved humanoids that roam the streets at night and feed on the uninfected.

Will we outsmart ourselves right into extinction? Will Smith plays Lt. Col. Robert Neville, a military scientist who is immune to the virus, hunting for a cure, and slowly being driven mad by loneliness and frustration.

Will Smith's performance was riveting and left me wondering how a person might cope when faced with the realization that you are quite possibly the last intelligent human left on earth. Overall, this movie was more than worth the price of admission.  It doesn't rely on over the top CGI effects; it relies on an intelligent audience allowing themselves to get caught up in the story.",1199145600,3,1115,4.806282722513089
1605134,4,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith is the last man on the Earth. Or is he? You will know the answer in the third (English-speaking feature-length) adaptation of Richard Matheson's famous and influential novella, where Smith's protagonist Robert Neville lives alone in New York City with his faithful dog Sam.

When I say alone, he is really alone in Manhattan. The film's first 40 minutes is the greatest part of it where Robert Neville can be seen driving a car wildly in the desert streets of New York City, hunting a herd of wild deer by day, and hiding in a bathroom with his dog by night, hearing weird noises from outside. Obviously he is trying to keep his sanity among the remnants of the civilization that is going to end. Director Francis Lawrence has a clear vision as to how the world would end, not with a bang but with a whimper.

Unfortunately, ""I Am Legend,"" some might say, really ends with a whimper. I am saying that it does not have actions - it has - but it is exactly the actions that might be a bit disappointing. They involve shootings, explosions and CGIs, but the film could have taken another approach. (And the new film changed the meaning of the title's ""Legend."") Not that I didn't enjoy watching them, though.

The film's location is, as I said, New York City while Matheson's original was set in LA. The change is a good idea as NYC has more recognizable landmarks which the film uses quite effectively during the flashback scenes. Also effective is Will Smith's acting as military scientist Robert Neville (formerly played by Vincent Price and Charlton Heston). His excellent acting makes up for the loss of the apocalyptic story's social undertone represented by ""Dark Seekers.""

Uncredited Emma Thompson appears briefly in the film's opening sequence, so don't be late for the show.",1199059200,,1793,4.737179487179487
1605135,5,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith does a remarkable and memorable job of acting in this, I Am Legend. If you have the empathy and fortitude to stay with him it is a gut-wrenching ride through sorrows, sanity, and insanity. Smith plays a strong character who sticks with it against all odds and keeps going even when he sees no hope. His hero is Bob Marley with his fortitude fighting against all odds and this links a sci-fi dilemma to the dispair that seems to characterize our times.
BE WARNED: This is not entertainment as such. It is slowly paced and in this will probably appeal only to mature adults who have the capacity to get empathetically into lonely characters. So it cannot be called an action film. The sci-fi is not escapist or impressively high tech. The sci-fi is a thin vehicle for exposition of a human being. The dialogue does not seem for the most part important, though the situations themselves certainly are important to the acting. The ending is not sensational.
I found it to be more an ordeal to watch than entertaining because there was constant tension and emotional suffering. I had to decide whether to stick with it or walk out. But it was well worth sticking with it to see a great artist given a rare chance to carry a substantial film.  I liked Crusoe for this reason, but Smith beat that and there is much more substance to Legend. I would say the same comparing it to Castaway. I appreciated the directing and editing here to be sure.
Unfortunately Legend is probably not a popcorn seller, but I hope that enough of the film-making and acting art in it will show through at the box office to encourage other talented American actors and directors nevertheless to get a chance to show their stuff.",1199059200,,1710,4.588235294117647

  Why was Neville a legend and to whom was he a legend?  He was a legend among the still-half-humans (the ones who hadn't gone full-blown vampire yet) as the daystalker who goes around and kills them in their sleep.  He wasn't a legend because he found 'the cure' as this movie states at the end.  In the two previous films, the Neville character spent the daytime hours hunting and killing the vampires totally unaware that there was a small population of infected humans who weren't eating people yet.  In this latest remake they even show a scene of Neville marking off on a map the buildings that he had checked but this is NEVER explained in the film.  They completely removed the vampire hunting aspect from the story which makes the 'marking-off-buildings-checked' scene totally nonsensical.

  This movie is yet another example of Hollywood signing a big star and casting him in an expensive CGI spectacular where he can run around doing amazing things before ultimately saving the day.  Well, they should have tried to save this story first.  It stinks.",1199059200,31,1284,4.725225225225225
1605137,4,B00005JPTK,"""I am Legend"", the third film based on the book by writer Richard Matheson, stars Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville. ""Legend"" is a surprisingly good film despite a spectacularly weak ending and easily the best of the three film adaptations.

Dr. Robert Neville, an army scientist, is the leading researcher looking for a cure to a virus. The virus once promised to cure cancer, but has ended up killing a large percentage of the population, leaving Robert alone in a virtually deserted New York City. He spends his days exercising with his dog, doing research to try to find a cure and trying to stay alive. I say virtually deserted New York City because at night, he has to barricade himself in his home, ready to fight off the zombie like creatures who come out at night. Portions of the people not killed by the virus have become creatures who hunt at night, feeding on the remaining humans. This situation has also helped to wipe out part of the survivors and made the creatures smarter and more resourceful- as their food supply dwindles, they figure out how to find food, becoming more ruthless, more determined, scarier. Robert knows about these creatures and is determined to protect is anonymity. One day, his dog chases an antelope into a dark building and he runs across a coven of these creatures. Determined to continue his research, he captures one and takes her back to his lab. But nothing seems to work. He continues to send out messages on a radio band and to do his research. But things will change soon, and drastically.

Entertainment Weekly recently listed Smith as one of ""The 50 Smartest People in Hollywood"". I'm not trying to validate this magazine filler, but they have a point. With remarkably rare exception, Smith has made remarkably well-received films serving to cement his place in the top echelon of actors who command top dollar for their films. Even when the films aren't great, they are fun. So we can possibly forgive him ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and ""Wild Wild West"" because he has given us such hits as the phenomenally successful ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"" and ""Bad Boys"". ""I am Legend,"" continues this trend, providing Smith with a star vehicle in which is he is virtually the only person on screen for a majority of the film. Because the film has made a lot of money, Smith will receive most of the credit for the film's success.

After the virus eradicates much of the world's human population, Robert, somehow immune, continues his research, working very hard to make sure his home remains a safe haven. He checks to almanac to make sure he and Sam, his daughter's dog, return home every day before sunset. He lowers shutters and barricades the door and sleeps in the bathtub, with the dog and a rifle at his side. To maintain his sanity, he watches videotapes of old television and pretends mannequins in a shop are real people, having conversations with them.

Because there are no people in New York City, the animals run wild and Robert and Sam are always on the hunt for new game, to supplement their diet. They chase a deer and Sam runs after the deer into a dark building. Robert is reluctant to follow her, but he can't leave his pet, his only daily contact, and his only tie to the past, to fall into the hands of the creatures that take over the night. Sure enough, they run into a group of them and Robert has to try to make it out. Somehow.

But Robert is also a scientist, so he returns to set a trap and capture one of them, to run some more experiments. Much like Sam running into the darkened building, the leader of the creatures tries to prevent one of his less intelligent followers from falling into the trap, but is unable to stop her in time.

""I Am Legend"" is very good. And it is so good because it convincingly sets up Robert's environment. I still can't figure out how they recreated the vacant, overgrown, slightly battered New York City. Robert races his car through empty streets, overgrown with weeds and littered with rusting cars. The filmmakers spent a lot of time and money on the special effects to recreate this. A shot of the bridges leading into Manhattan, both of which were hit by missiles many years ago, is particularly stunning.

Smith is virtually the only person on screen for 80% of the film. Can there be any further definition of a star `carrying a film'? Also, because of the leading man's inherent charisma and charm, he commands our attention on the screen and makes us believe he is a scientist capable of finding a cure to a virus that has wiped out 90% of the world's population. How refreshing and different from other actors who pop up and try to portray nuclear scientists or heart surgeons and barely look like they can apply their lipstick or shave.

As Smith's Robert Neville moves through his world, a world we are just learning about, he is almost a tour guide for us, introducing us to the various modifications he has made in order to survive. This is a testament to Smith's skill because we never feel as though he is trying to teach us, as though he is on a pulpit explaining things to us. We learn through his actions, his observances, by watching him as he deals with the routine he has set up.

Director Francis Lawrence (""Constantine"") paces the film well, catching our attention with an action packed sequence. He fills in the details later. After a brief prologue, we are immediately plunged into Robert's world and watch as he and Sam hunt wild animals. As the film progresses, Robert remembers key events leading to the evacuation of New York, which he refers to as ""Ground Zero"" for the virus on more than one occasion. These scenes also give us a look at what happened to his wife and child, giving us more details about how Robert is willing and able to cope with this strange situation.

Because we are immediately thrust into this man's current situation, we get a real sense of what he has been living through. This is the majority of his life now, everything else, as important as it was, is now secondary. The filmmakers have placed the emphasis in the right place and make the story all the more engrossing and exciting.

There are a couple of enigmatic moments my friends and I have been talking about, because they could mean a couple of different things. Not because they are confusing or uninteresting. These discussions have led all people to have further consideration for each side of the argument. How often do you come out of an action / sci-fi film talking about things, trying to figure them out, having discussions?

For all of the work spent on creating a post-apocalyptic New York, some of the CGI character work is less than perfect. The creatures are interesting and ""Alpha Male"", as he is listed in IMDB, the leader of these vampire - zombie creatures does seem to have some intelligence, some capability to lead the rest of his coven. But some of these creatures are less convincing than others. Late in the film, the Alpha Male unleashes some of his infected dogs and they are particularly fake looking. So, the CGI is not consistent throughout.

And the film begins to fall apart in the last act, leading us to a particularly weak ending. When the DVD is released, you could have a double bill featuring ""I am Legend"" and ""The Village"" and it might seem like one seamless film.

But these complaints aside, ""I am Legend"" is still an extremely strong film and worthy of your money.",1199059200,,7437,4.615733736762481
1605138,5,B00005JPTK,"I thought this movie was very good, and wanted to see it again the next day. The CG was a little unbelievable and reminded me of the movie ""The Mummy"". Other than that, I felt the story was very good, and the acting top notch. The end was a shocker, and was totally unexpected, but it just made the movie that much better. I plan to buy this video when it is released and will be in my special collection of favorites.",1199059200,2,418,4.109756097560975
1605139,3,B00005JPTK,"This movie put the right director and star together, but they chose the wrong script.  At one point, this movie had a brilliant script by Mark Protosevich.  Unfortunately they had it reworked by Akiva Goldsman (whose computer is where good scripts go to die) and they lost the chance to make a really good movie.

And it is truly the writing that tanks this film.  Will Smith's character has no consistency.  Sometimes he is the calm, levelheaded scientist, and then he is demonstrably insane (talking to mannequins like they are real).  The monsters are similarly inconsistent: we're told and shown that they are subhuman beasts with no conscious intelligence; all they know is their basic urges (hunger, aggression, etc.).  But then the movie has them set a trap that would take a great deal of thought and preparation and knowledge of Smith's character that suggests they had evolved millennia in mere days.  The inconsistency in this script is maddening.

On the good side, there are three action sequences in this film that are absolute show-stoppers.  Director Francis Lawrence knows how to build suspense and put you in the action.  One scene in particular -- which I won't spoil by detailing -- was absolutely frightening.

For some really odd reason, a religious slant comes into the story right at the end and then becomes an instrumental part of the plot even though it had no involvement previously.  It's just another example of a poorly written script.

To call the ending unsatisfying is to let it off easy.  It's one of the worst endings I have literally ever seen.  It is almost like the final reel of the movie is missing.

Will Smith does what he can.  And I was impressed by Francis Lawrence's direction.  But the script really ruins a chance for what could have been an entertaining commercial film.  As it exists now, it is a valiant, noble failure of good intentions.",1198972800,2,1890,4.8105590062111805
1605140,4,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith survives a mutant virus that has him running for his life from most of the other ""survivors.""  So begins ""I Am Legend.""

The ""I Am Legend"" film is different from all previous versions of this story.  Many of the new plot and story elements will appeal more to today's audience.  Some of the esoteric and philosophical messages of the original story are lost, but this film stands on it's own.

First of all, the burning questions: Is this film worth seeing in the theatre, or should I wait for the DVD to release?

Answer:  GO SEE THIS IN THE THEATRE!!!  Also, films like this will make their HD DVD counterparts more attractive as well.  But I digress.

The visual elements of this movie are worth the price of admission alone.  Everything is done well together - special effects, lighting, sound, aspect.  The in-movie songs used could have been more diverse, but the score more than makes up for it.  Bottom line, I would pay to see this in the theatre again, and I can't wait to see what it looks like in HD with 7.1 surround sound at home.

Now, how about the acting?  Will Smith is really great in this movie.  Women will no doubt drool at the work-out scene that was put in every trailer.  He gives a very real portrayal that's more than just eye candy.

Now, some of the story elements go backwards in the second half of the movie.  But I think that was done intentionally, agree or disagree.  They really wanted to show him fighting to keep it together, and breaking down at times, and the plot suffers as a result.

As for the plot, there's no need to re-hash that or give spoiler details.  We all know the basics from the trailer.  See the movie and be surprised.

One thing I am very interested in the future DVD is potential alternate endings.  Since this story deviated from the original, I wonder if there was any waffling on that.  We'll all have to wait and see.

Overall, this is a very good movie for SCI-FI fans and special effects lovers.  The story stands on it's own and is a very good production despite some minor technical blips.

Enjoy!!!",1198886400,16,2076,4.446808510638298
1605191,3,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is a classic story of ""be careful what you wish for."" In the future, a cure for cancer is discovered. Everyone is happy and the creator of the vaccine is hailed as a visionary. Shortly thereafter, it is discovered that the so-called miracle cure actually mutates and causes those who have been vaccinated to turn into rabid, zombie-like creatures who lose their hair, have bloody eyes, and exhibit aggression toward other human beings. When these beings get hungry, they attack human beings until, in the year 2013, there are none left. Or so scientist Robert Neville believes. Alone on the island of Manhattan, but for his dog Sam, Robert attempts to find a cure for the disease and to keep himself from falling victim to the zombies created by the KV vaccine.

I Am Legend is startingly like 28 Days Later, and as other reviewers have mentioned, I think that movie did a better job. I did, however, find this movie entertaining, and that's what's important. It's not great. It won't change your life. But it will entertain you, and that's about all I can ask for. If you want a better movie, with a similar theme, try Children on Men with Clive Owen and Julianne Moore. That movie did a much better job of portraying dystopia and the demise of the world.",1198886400,,1268,4.610619469026549

While the post-apocolyptic images of New York are more haunting then if the film had been set in any other city; by now it's almost become cliche and irresponsible. At several points, Smith refers to New York as ""Ground Zero"" for the outbreak of the virus; yet, the allusion to 9-11 is overt. Throwing in some zombies and a formulaic ending only serve to cheapen the amatuer comment that this film attempts to make on sacrifice, social degradation, and (ironically) irresponsibility.

1605193,2,B00005JPTK,"Will Smith stated in a recent 60 Minutes interview that when he and his agent were mapping out his career strategy, they noted that most of the top ten films of all time were those with lots of special effects. Films like Independence Day, Men in Black and Wild, Wild West followed. After seeing I Am Legend, I have to say that it's time for Mr. Smith to drop the popcorn movies and put his talent to much better use.

I've seen both of the previous film versions of Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend. I saw the Vincent Price version -- Last Man on Earth -- when I was young and don't remember it that well. But I have seen The Omega Man several times and, in fact, own a copy of it on DVD. The Omega Man is dated, to be sure -- 70's hipster language and Charlton Heston do not mix. However, the opening sequences of the film, showing a deserted Los Angeles, are eerily effective. In one shot, we can see nothing moving for miles -- no people, no cars, no traffic helicopters ... nothing at all. Anyone who has been in Los Angeles can tell you what an accomplishment an effect like that really is. With good supporting performances by Rosiland Cash and, especially, Anthony Zerbe as the ringleader of the vampires/mutants, The Omega Man is flawed, but in the end, very, very effective.

I Am Legend, similarly, has some fairly effective opening shots of a deserted New York City. However, on closer inspection, the viewer can see that a lot of the effect is due to CGI. The weeds growing out of the streets don't look quite right and the delapidated look on the buildings is very unconvincing. This flaw is hammered home when Smith chases a herd of deer in his Mustang. When a lion attacks one of the deer, the effect is so artificial looking, I was wondering if Yogi Bear was going to appear next.

Nowhere, however, do the CGI effects fail more completely than with the vampire mutants. In contrast with The Omega Man where the mutants are played by live actors, all of the creatures in I Am Legend are CGI. The effect is ridiculously cartoonish and wholly unconvincing. And what kind of killer virus actually makes its victims more agile? These creatures were once human beings and now they're able to climb up walls of Manhattan brownstones like mountain goats? Instead of being frightened by the creatures, I found myself rolling my eyes and wondering when Hollywood was going to realize just how bad some CGI effects really look.

However, the film's shortcoming aren't just technical. The Omega Man had an extended flashback sequence showing how the virus overtook civilization. Many people drop dead right before our eyes and the horror of the situation is hammered home very effectively. I Am Legend, in contrast, gives up dribs and drabs of flashbacks -- mostly as Smith's dream sequences. The most impressive shot in the film shows fighter jets blowing up the bridges leading into Manhattan -- one of the times where the special effects are really up to the task. However, we never get the same sense of horror watching civilization collapse that we do in The Omega Man. We see a couple of infected people fail a screening and that's about the extent of it. We don't see anyone mutate into one of the creatures. We don't see dozens drop dead from the virus. The fall of civilization doesn't deliver the dramatic punch to the stomach it should.

Smith is alone for most of the film. Towards the end, a mother and her son rescue him and briefly move in with him. In The Omega Man, we learn about Rosiland Cash's character and her infected nephew. In I Am Legend, however, the two characters are merely a plot device. They're basically there to move the plot to its conclusion and nothing more. The parts are so badly written, I wondered why they were necessary at all. Instead of caring about these new characters, I spent the final part of the film thinking about what a weak job the screenwriter did on that portion of the script.

The only really good thing about I Am Legend is Will Smith's performance. He is excellent at portraying a man who is slowly going mad from lonliness. His heart is in the project even with the numerous flaws and his acting is the only really convincing thing about the entire film. Throughout the film I kept thinking that Smith's performance deserved a better film to showcase it. I felt bad for him, but that sympathy has to be tempered by the knowledge that it was his career goal to seek out projects like this.

I'll grant Smith that some of his ""prestige projects"" like Ali and The Legend of Bagger Vance didn't do that well at the box office. Hollywood, for all the talk about creative expression, is driven by ticket sales and money. However, The Pursuit of Happyness did do well at the box office and showed that Will Smith, given a good script and a good director to work with, can combine artistic excellence with financial success without having to resort to loads of stunts and special effects. Leonardo DiCaprio chooses to work with name directors on films with good scripts in lieu of the summer blockbuster films and he still has as much influence and industry muscle as anyone in Hollywood. There is no reason why Will Smith can't do the same thing. He is supremely talented and intelligent (I'm positive he could be a terrific writer, director and producer as well as actor), should minimize his participation in films like I Am Legend and should choose projects that take more risks and aspire to more than just box office receipts. I Am Legend and other films like it are just a waste of his talent.",1198713600,8,5564,4.574724172517553
1605194,4,B00005JPTK,"I really liked ""I Am Legend"", Francis Lawrence did an excellent job in a genre that's been done to death.  At it's core it's about one man alone in the world.  I felt the movie was very original in it's execution amazing cinematography, editing, and FX.  I'm a big sci-fi fan and can see how in any other directors' hands, this movie could have been one big cliche'.  The  storytelling is unpredictable and keeps you very interested.  Will smith does an excellent job in this role.  Definitely worth the price of a movie ticket.  Check it out.",1198713600,,543,4.525773195876289
1605195,3,B00005JPTK,"Not a seasonal pick-me-upper.  Despite that it ends on a reasonably upbeat note, this film is distressing and difficult to watch.  Another in a string of apocalyptic fear-based family films, the cure for cancer has had an undesired side effect and wiped out the human population.  One man and his dog remain to combat this grave twist of events.  As if the setup of dwindling life isn't bleak enough, the solitary life of Smith's character and the daily effort to survive while seeking a cure creates some heart stopping moments and really creepy psychological provocations.  I went into this film assuming Smith would hold his usual action hero poise, and he does to some degree.  While he is a wonderful action hero in his career, Smith is at core a gifted dramatic actor and that talent comes through in this role.  The usual running scenes, blazing fires and such abound, but they are rooted in an emotional backstory that helps viewers to understand the main character's motivations.  In that light the story is very well-rounded.  Viewers receive the action-packed thriller laced with some fairly intense emotional scenes.  Then begins the second half.

The scariest part of this film is the deserted streets of NYC.  All in all the film is well done, acting, direction...  but something about it was really off for me, which I can only assume was the writing.  Smith spends a lot of screen time alone and despite the challenge of having to hold the momentum of the story solo, he pulls it off.  I can't in any way fault him for my feeling that the film was incomplete.  It moves very slowly, adrenaline its only initiator of plot movement in some cases.  I do like that the writing showed the main character's struggle to remain sane under such circumstances.  Most often our end of days films focus more on the hero's feats than his assured flaws.  Still, there were such leaps in the plot that I was unconvinced of the direction it took.  The finale, though realistically suited to the story, felt rushed, thus lacking.",1198713600,7,2028,4.756446991404012
1605196,2,B00005JPTK,"This movie is slow, dull, and boring with injections of adrenalin to keep you from falling asleep.  Will Smith does a good job but good acting cannot salvage what is a poor screen play.  The deserted New York is very well done but the entire film drags plus it has some serious logical flaws.  Where are the bodies and/or skeletons?  If the surviors have resorted to cannabalism why are they only preying on the sole survior? Shouldn't some be starving? If they are eating abandoned food why are they attacking the one survivor?  If they are irrational and preying on humans why are they not attacking each other?  Where is the electricty coming from?  The first time he enters his safe house he hides his tracks but doesn't do that at any other time yet that is how he is tracked down.  Who set the trap for him?  That was left open -- why were cars used as counter weights when it would be easier to use something more easily handled?  Why was he constantly driving at high speeds?  Shooting a deer would have been easy yet he chose to chase them in his car -- why not run one down?  This whole sequence was contrived and sort of dumb.

The film has long draggy sequences which were punctuated with attacks by over active zombies who appear to act irrationally and with no clear motive.  I watched this film with my sons, nephews, and grandsons -- none of them liked it and all of them thought we should have selected a different movie -- and I hardily agree.  This was a poor movie but the fault lies not the stars but in the screen play.  I would say don't bother with this one.",1198713600,5,1582,4.348122866894198
1605197,3,B00005JPTK,"Oh look, another remake. Wow. Woop. What fun.

Do I sound overly cynical? Maybe I am. But can't we see a few more original films on the big screen rather than mulling over the same ones year after year? Is that asking too much? Perhaps it is.

Growing up, I loved The Omega Man. I often wondered what it'd be like to be the last man on Earth; at least the last ""normal"" man on Earth. The genre wasn't yet tired in 1971 and I wasn't even into my teens. But since then not-just-a-small-number of similar cinematic films have come out, bombarding movie watchers with the same ol' theme over and over and over again (see my partial list above).

Will Smith (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pursuit-of-Happyness/dp/B000N6U0E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pursuit of Happyness</a>) takes on the lead role as Dr. Robert Neville, the seemingly sole survivor of a plague that has wiped out 99% of humanity, turning the remaining 1% into cannibalistic zombie-vampires who burn up if exposed to sunlight; they roam New York's desolate streets at night in search of fresh meat. A cure for cancer has sparked a new virus that started humanity's die-off, and these scenes are given frequent flashbacks during the movie. We also get to see Dr. Neville's responsibility for trying to find a cure via the military (whom he works for before everyone keels over).

With Dr. Neville is a trusty sidekick named Sam, a German Shepherd with acute senses. His canine abilities extend to detecting vampire-zombies, and to helping Neville battle the complete aloneness that rattles around his psyche. This is undoubtedly one of the strongest elements of the film. Watching Dr. Neville walk into a video rental store and speak to the mannequins he has set up is an honest portrayal that would hit any human who had only a dog to speak with.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!

When Sam-the-Dog dies (or rather when Dr. Neville is forced to kill him), it is a blow too deep and the good doctor goes out to meet up and kill as many of the nightstalkers as he can before they kill him. That's when he meets up with two young people (an older sister and younger brother) who save Neville from himself and tell him of a fantasy safe zone somewhere in the hills of Vermont. Neville has to decide what to believe in as the monsters close in on his home and threaten not only himself, but his two new god-fearing humans. The ending is pretty weak but set up nicely in a visual way.

END SPOILER ALERT!!!

Having hoisted such terrible news as ""unoriginal"" on I Am Legend, one cannot deny two key elements that make this film a positive experience. First is the extremely creepy feeling one gets when looking at a vacant New York City. The weeds growing up from cracks in the pavement. Wild deer migrating through empty car-riddled streets. Everywhere there's a vision of what once was human inhabitation and is now just a rotting shell. That was a painfully great set of scenes. Secondly is Will Smith. Similar to Tom Hanks'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cast-Away/dp/B00005V9IJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cast Away</a>, Smith carries the entire film and does so with effortless precision. The losses he experiences are tremendous, and Smith pulls us in and forces us to feel the pain of one man left alone for far too long. This is most evident when dealing with Sam-the-Dog and his encounters with a pretty mannequin that he starts to humanize in his mind.

Some might be able to wiggle past this film's unoriginality factor, and if they can, I applaud them. They probably enjoyed the movie (minus the ending) much better than I was able. But if you're like me, and desire something fresh in the cinema, you'll probably have similar feelings.",1198627200,,4952,6.113669064748201
1605198,4,B00005JPTK,"I'll get straight to the point- if you've read the book and are expecting a faithful adaptation, you'll be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're expecting a good post-apocalyptic thriller, then you'll enjoy it.

First, in response to what some other people have been saying, this is NOT a remake of ""The Omega Man."" This is a re-interpretation of the original book ""I am Legend."" It follows Richard Matheson's classic source material in its broad outlines. The human race has been decimated by a virus, and turned some of them into Nocturnal predators. Dr. Robert Neville, formerly a great Army doctor, may be the last man on earth and eeks out a living in deserted New York City. During the day, he gathers what food and supplies he can from stores and houses, and hunts deer. Neville has an alarm on his watch that goes off at a certain point in the day so that he knows when to return to his home. In addition, Neville has a lab in his basement with rats that have been infected with the virus, and injects them with various experimental serums in a desperate effort to find a cure to the virus. Neville's only companionship is his daughter's dog Samantha and news tapes from the time before the world went to hell. Before the sun goes down, Neville shuts his house up and sleeps with a gun to protect himself from the predators outside. One day while hunting deer, Samantha wanders into a dark building and Neville, frustrated, follows her. He then encounters a ""hive"" (as he calls them) of the creatures, and barely escapes with his life. Our hero then sets up a trap for one of the creatures so that he can capture one and test his serum on, and succeeds in his plan, though the serum appears not to be successful. Neville continues to struggle with his isolation, and begins to lose his sense of reality. He talks to the mannequins he has set up, pleading with them to talk back, and unfortunately falls into one of his own traps. Things take a turn for the worse after that, and I will stop the plot synopsis there.

Will Smith does a good job in the lead role, despite the fact that many say he was miscast. As I mentioned earlier, the movie does not follow the book very closely, so purist fans of the book will be disappointed. Briefly, here are some of the differences:

*The creatures in the book are definitely vampires, and in the movie they are simply nocturnal predators.
*In the book, the vampires can talk and recognize people, whereas in the movie the creatures have lost all human higher brain functions.
*In the book, the vampires are invulnerable to anything except a stake through the heart and sunlight. The creatures in the movie are still vulnerable to sunlight, but otherwise are as vulnerable as humans (even though they are much stronger).
*The character Robert Neville in the book was not a doctor before the outbreak, or a scientist of any kind.
*In the book, what turned people into vampires was a germ spread by mutant insects and dust storms after an implied nuclear war. In the movie, it's a virus that's the result of a cancer cure gone wrong.
*The reasons for the title ""I am Legend"" are very different in the movie than the book.
*The ending is not a complete cop-out, but is considerably more optimistic than the book's ending.

There are other differences, but that list should give readers a good idea. ""I am Legend"" does offer enough for sci-fi/horror fans to be satisfied, however. For instance, there's definitely plenty of suspense, particularly when Neville follows his dog into a dark building and discovers a ""hive"" of the creatures. Further, the theme of isolation is always present- Neville at one point tearfully pleads to mannequins to say hello to him. Overall, I would recommend this.",1198627200,,3744,4.642533936651584

1605270,4,B00005JPTK,"Though it stoops for unearned sentimentality at the end, ""I Am Legend,"" until then, is a spine-tingling vision of a future devoid of humanity.  And hope.  Will Smith turns in a landmark performance as Dr. Robert Neville, the sole survivor in a New York City decimated by a man-made plague.  During the day, Neville and his faithful dog travel the city for sustenance and spiritual survival.  The images of a downtown Manhattan crumbling and decaying are downright chilling.  But in the dark corners await bloodthirsty monsters that were transformed by the plague from ordinary humans to something more primitive, feral and terrifying.  Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) and gifted cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings) construct nerve-frying, blood-freezing sequences in an abandoned building and a New York seaport at night when Neville finds himself face to face with the cannibalistic creatures.  But Neville's true fight is not with them or with the disease he so fervently tries to cure; it's with his own dissipating sanity.  Where the film works best is when it let's Smith work his Hanksian magic, chronicling Neville's daily routine (talking to Manicheans as if they were real, waiting in seeming vain at the aforementioned seaport for any sign of life) to fight off absolute desolation.  Smith finds the ravaged, fragile soul of a man fighting for one more day, one more fleeting chance that hope will reveal itself.  When Lawrence and his screenwriters stick with this bleak, desperate story for survival, ""I Am Legend"" connects with unexpected emotional body blows.  The predictable deus ex machina ending blunts the emotional impact shows, but until then, ""I Am Legend"" is a harrowing vision of a future where hope hangs by a vulnerable thread.",1198540800,,1779,5.185314685314685
1605271,4,B00005JPTK,"I AM LEGEND is a sci-fi disaster film that is another attempt at adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel back in the early `50's. The first adaptation being ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) with Vincent Price and the cheesy but entertaining ""Omega Men"" (1971) with Charlton Heston. Being a remake, ""I am Legend"" leaves a lot to be desired with the unpredictability factor. However, with the current evolution in CGI effects, expectations would be high. ""Legend"" is the one version bestowed with a huge budget.

A cure for cancer based on the Measles virus of old has achieved partial success. While it does cure the lethal disease, it was one side effect; it mutates human beings into vampire-like creatures that feed on human flesh. Military scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith) is left alone in New York with only a German Shepherd for company, for 3 years he has been looking for a cure but to no avail. Slowly, he is starting to give in to the pressure of being alone and hopelessness begins to sink in. Now, as new survivors surface, Neville is caught by surprise and finds a struggle within himself to remain optimistic in finding a cure or wonder if the human race has been snuffed out for good.

The direction by Francis Lawrence (Constantine) is competent enough to handle this kind of project. The first half of the film shows Neville and his dog, Sam in their daily routine. They try to battle boredom and mental collapse by hunting deers, driving around the ""ghost city"" looking for supplies and even renting videos, hitting golf balls off the East River. It was smart for the director to establish a rendezvous point for potential survivors alongside the river at noon everyday. Neville's loneliness is also emphasized that he has set up a certain spot where he had arranged mannequins as an attempt to simulate a crowd. It was very considerate of the director to consider certain emotions that can creep in when one is isolated in large Empty City with certain creatures lurking in the night. Along with the very delicate link of sanity Neville has to his dog, one can wonder how long a man left alone can last. Certain situation studies have been explored before in films such as ""Castaway"". Luckily, Neville has more company with a dog than just a volleyball, the dog certainly had more charisma than ""Wilson the volleyball"". The past is also shown in flashbacks as to what happened to Neville and New York.

The film's success also depends on how good the performance is of the lead actor. Will Smith has definitely matured as an actor since his days in ""Fresh Prince"". Smith's performance is pretty solid as the lead; while he mostly plays a reactionary role, he manages to express the needed emotions in the sequences that I felt his fears, thoughts and loneliness. Sure, there is still the usual snappy charisma that has become his trademark but he manages to sidestep that image and pulls off a very good performance.

The film isn't perfect. There is a HUGE plot hole in the beginning of the last act, Neville's meeting with a survivor seemed so convenient that it's almost far-fetched. The ""Dark Seekers"" have that charcoaled-grayish-dehydrated look that seemed a little fake. (I thought I was watching a Pang Bros. Horror flick for a moment). Thankfully, the characteristics of the creatures are more interesting; they are stronger and faster than the zombies in 28 DAYS LATER, and to make things worst for Neville, they are a lot smarter. This intelligence was displayed with their observance of a ""pack leader"" and the ability to learn and imitate what they have seen.

Unfortunately, the film didn't have the guts to follow through with its dark premise of pure despair of a lonely man in large city. It opted to settle for the usual heroics and while the film did have some emotional and intense sequences that redeemed it, it went on the direction of faith and Catholicism. While there may be nothing wrong in trying to emphasize human optimism and belief in a higher power, the conclusion was a little less satisfying and quite frankly, it collapsed in its predictability. ""I Am Legend"" carried a lot of potential but ultimately, it stumbles halfway through and lacked a very powerful climax. I am sad to say it fell just a little short of its truly majestic vision.

1605272,4,B00005JPTK,"First, I am going to say that if you want an objective review, you'd better read a different review of this film. I went to the theaters as someone who:

1. Had read the book, loved it and knew that Will Smith was probably not going to do an exact recreation of that book. That was fine by me. I can accept artistic license, in this case.

2. Is a huge fan of Will Smith. I could probably listen to him read the phone book, name by name.

3. Loves apocalyptic, vampire and similar movies, even some that others would consider cheesy, campy or just plain dumb.

So there are my disclaimers, right up front. If you read on, you do so at your own risk...or because you have a similar mindset. But don't say I didn't warn you.

I do suggest that you consider the fact that this book has been considered very hard to put on the screen - and rightly so, as far as I'm concerned. The book, a post-apocalyptic tale of one man surrounded by vampire types - is one of my favorites and I've read and reread it many times. However, I wondered how it'd work as a film adaptation.

It isn't true to the book, not in the way a movie like To Kill A Mockingbird or The Yearling attempts to be true to the source material. Even so, I'd recommend this movie. I intend to see it again. Will Smith, generally very watchable on screen, doesn't disappoint and he reveals the unraveling of a man who is in the most desperate of circumstances, unhinged, not sure who is friend or foe or even the complete situation.

Smith has the added challenge of appearing as a solo performer for a huge part of the film, a challenge in itself. He held my attention, utterly.

Maybe I missed it but I never got the sense that the movie explained why or how there was an illness or disease that wiped out much of the world. Maybe a mutated virus? The cause isn't as important as the situation, a truly ghastly one, one man left amongst a group of vampirish types, crazy and demented.

 I couldn't keep my eyes off of Smith's face as he showed a range of emotions, reminding me that the man is an extremely talented actor. If you focus only on the accuracy of the translation of book to film, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment but if you can let that go....and take this film for what it is...and accept the vision of the director and the acting talents of Smith, you'll be in for one wonderful ride (read my disclaimers above first).

Also, I do have to note that the CG special effects bothered me some. I'm not a huge fan of those. Yet I still intend to see the film again, allowing my selective focus to hone in on the areas of the film I loved.

I happened to really like 28 Days Later so this might be the type of film that fans of that movie would like, too.",1198540800,3,2740,4.227969348659004

1605274,1,B00005JPTK,"I'm a Will Smith fan, and this movie really sucked. Most of the movie is just him and his dog, no other people except for flashbacks. I was bored  most of the time. It's got some good suspense and in some points is pretty scary. I think I will remember the part about Bob Marley, forget the rest.",1198454400,14,296,4.103448275862069
1605275,4,B00005JPTK,"The story begins with one of humanity's greatest hopes seemingly fulfilled. Dr. Alice Krippen (Emma Thompson) has discovered the cure for cancer. This cure is a virus that is a subset of measles. Paraphrasing her words: the virus is a fast car.  Measles is like putting a criminal at the wheel.  What she did was ""replace that criminal with a cop.""

At the time of the announcement, clinical trials had taken place with 10,900 subjects.  All were cancer-free.  Something clearly went very wrong between the clinical trials and the introduction of Krippen Virus (KV) into the population.

At the time KV was introduced into the population, there were 6 billion people on earth. The virus killed 90% of those. The remaining 9% became rabid and photophobic, running in hives only at night and killing whatever they came in contact with.

Dr. Robert Neville is one of the 1% of the population immune to KV--and survived. At onset, he was a US Army Colonel and virologist living in New York City.

Even three years later, Neville hasn't given up.  He takes his motto from his hero, Bob Marley:

""The people, who were trying to make this world worse... are not taking a day off. How can I? Light up the darkness.""

By day, he and his faithful dog, Sam, travel the city looking for other survivors.  He daily broadcasts a message over all AM frequencies, asking anyone alive and uninfected to come to the South Street Seaport at mid-day offering to provide food, shelter and safety.

By night, he hides in his heavily fortified home, preparing food and urging Sam to ""eat your vegetables."" He watches one movie per night, which he takes from a nearby video store--apparently viewing in alphabetical order.  He's now up to ""G"". In his basement, he's gathered a fully equipped medical laboratory and he's still working on a cure.  He still has hope, although his psyche is beginning to show cracks.

Through flashbacks, we see Neville evacuating his wife and daughter from the city and the frantic efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.

Probably the best aspect of this film is Will Smith. He does an impressive job of playing a physician keeping lone vigil over the city that was his charge--and holding on to his own waning hope and sanity. Sam the dog is the only character who can upstage him.

I also loved the tributes to Bob Marley.  Like Anna (Alice Braga) in the film, so many of our current generation don't know the man's music or his story.  I'm glad to see both revisited in a popular format. And yes--I agree--Marley was one of the greatest musicians ever.

What I found impossible to believe was the 'science.' Inconceivable that 10,900 people in the initial clinical trials showed no signs of the rabid KV virus?  Further, if the virus is also contagious to animals, wouldn't the rabidity, etc. have shown up in the animal testing which occurs prior to the human. I realize a good part of movie viewing is the 'suspension of disbelief' but I not only had to 'suspend,' I had to kick everything I know about the drug discovery process right out of my head. I honestly believe they could have come up with something far more plausible than this backstory.

There are some warnings here:

1.  While the movie ends with hope, you're going to be going through a lot of depressing material to get there.  Don't go if you're looking for a holiday escape 'pick me up film.'  This isn't it.
2.  If you are intolerant of suspense, reconsider going.  My husband had to leave the theatre because he just couldn't handle parts of the film.
3.  If scientific accuracy is your bag, you are going to hate this film for the reason I stated above (and more).
4.  If you are a devotee of the original Richard Matheson book, you may well disapprove of the redux.

All that being said, I still enjoyed much of the film. ""I am Legend"" will be a one-time view for me, but still worth the distraction on a quiet Christmas Eve morning.",1198454400,3,3925,4.627167630057803
1605276,4,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is effective as a thriller through the first three quarters of the film, but unfortunately it is unable to keep up the momentum through the ending, leaving most avid movie fans disappointed and unsatisfied. The film tells the story of Robert Neville, a military scientist who apparently is the only survivor of a terrible virus, first billed as the cure for cancer, which instead has either killed or mutated the human population of earth. Neville spends his days collecting food and searching for a cure with Sam his beloved dog, and his nights surviving the mutant onslaught.

Will Smith holds the film together with his fantastic performance as Neville. He effectively portrays the mental breakdown of a man who has not seen another human in three years. Neville fights his mental demons just as much as the physical demons. Neville is consumed by his desire to ""fix"" the situation and find a cure, and Smith accurately depicts his panic in trying to do so, as well as his attempt to keep himself sane through setting up mannequins at his local movie store and talking to his dog.

Coupled with Smith's performance is the breathtaking cinematography. The sweeping shots of a deserted NYC are stunning, as well as the panicked flashbacks into the evacuation process when the ""cure"" becomes deadly. Just watching the shots of New York's empty landmarks is enough to make I Am Legend worthwhile. Unfortunately, though, the CGI mutants leave something to be desired, and really aren't that terrifying. The monsters on the city streets look like the animation from Alvin and the Chipmunks (okay, maybe not that bad).

Similarly, the script holds the film together nicely, providing scares as well as humor. However, the writers slackened off in the end, diverting from focusing on Neville's sanity, an approach which had worked so well up to that point, to focusing on simply the plot, with a poor Hollywood-cliche ending.

Overall, though, Smith's performance and the stunning cinematography make I Am Legend worth a look, for all movie fans.",1198454400,2,2053,4.97667638483965
1605277,4,B00005JPTK,"Like most fans of horror literature, I've read the book, I Am Legend by Richard Matheson.  Matheson is (next to Lovecraft) the most important figure in horror in the twentieth century.  This famous book almost created the concept of ""the last real human left on Earth.""  In the book, it is vampires.  In the movies, they became ""mutants,"" or zombies, or ""the infected.""

This film gives us monsters who are a cross between vampires and zombies.  They are like vampires because they cannot be exposed to sunlight.  Otherwise, they are like the zombies of the 28 Days Later mold - exceptionally fast and strong.  (I still have a problem with fast, strong zombies - where do they get their strength from, especially considering they are so under-nourished.  But perhaps I am being too literal.)

This movie works because the filmmakers choose to use suspense over cheap shocks.  It is amazing how long it takes to even see one of the monsters.  Most of the film is about Will Smith trying (and failing) to hold onto his sanity as he wonders through the surreally empty Manhattan.

There are flaws in the film to be sure - mostly, some badly done CGI effects.  All in all, it works.  It is about time this film was made.  For years, it has been kicking around Hollywood attached to people like Schwarzenegger and so on.  It was even listed in an Entertainment Weekly article about the ""best scripts never made.""  Now, it has been made.  As a benefit, the book is popular again - and  whole generation of new readers will discover the old master.",1198368000,,1541,4.637037037037037
1605278,5,B00005JPTK,"When a novel is written, the reader is free to explore their creative side by picturing an unraveling plot in their heads.  In other words, some novels are very hard to re-create into motion pictures because their story lines are so unworldly and so creative that cinema may ruin our mental images of what it should be.  However, despite movies almost never living up to the book, Richard Matheson must be proud of this rendition.  Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist living in New York as a survivor of a deadly virus that killed off most of the world and made vampires of the rest of them.  By day, he hunts the streets of the city, which has been overtaken by wild animals and he searches stores and homes with his dog, Sam, for any food and entertainment to move him along through the day.  By night, his house is protected with any and every means of security you can think of in order to keep away the vampires that lurk in the shadows.
Ultimately, Neville's goal is to find the cure for this deadly disease in order to save the human race.

As many of the previous reviewers have stated, the first half of the film gives the impression that this could be one of the all-time greats.  The phenomenal re-creation of New York City was more than enough to capture the viewer's attention and fill their blood with intrigue.  It's the type of experience in the movies where each time you watch the scenes in Times Square, you notice something different.  For instance, the gas prices (God help us) are over $6 a gallon, or the billboard of the long awaited Superman vs. Batman film that never got off the ground.

The latter half of the film demonstrates how predictably clich hero stories have become in cinema.  However, I can only praise the work Will Smith does in this movie.  His acting was so good that I left the theater convinced that he is in a league of his own among Hollywood talent.  His emotions are so believable that it literally saves what may be portrayed as completely ridiculous scenes in the movie.  As some of the reviews stated, there were episodes where Smith's loneliness and frustration was overtaking him with such force that you could feel tears burning in the back of your eyes.  His acting was absolutely sensational, to say the least.
This movie was the story of one man, and there is no man that could do it like Will Smith.  I couldn't think of another actor that can stand alone and excel the way Will did in this movie.
It saves very mediocre directing and a somewhat slumping plot line as the film evolves.  However, this IS a five star film.  It's a well played out drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the use of silence only adds to the heart-stopping suspense.  I'd recommend it to anyone interested in action or drama, and it's a must for any fan of Will Smith.

1605279,3,B00005JPTK,"A pretty good zombie movie, with Will Smith professing amazing acting prowess. His loneliness, desperation, and conviction are extraordinary.

1605350,3,B00005JPTK,"This is the third remake of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend""  The first half of the movie is visually stunning, and Will Smith does a magnificent job of portraying a man alone surrounded by evil, slowly coming unglued.  The second half degenerates into smaltz.
The whole point of Matheson's story is that the title is a play on words.  In our time, adults have frightened their children, and themselves, with stories of goulies, ghosties, and things that go bump in the night.  Probably the most terrifying of these is the vampire, an almost perfect amalgam of sex, blood-lust, and death.  In Matheson's reversal, there is only one human left in a world of vampires, and the human spends the daylight hours hunting and killing the sleeping vampires.  He himself has become the thing of legend; the monster that rules the day instead of the night and the terrifying creature the vampires use to frighten THEIR children.
I still think the best rendition was the first one, a black and white film called ""The Last Man on Earth"", with Vincent Price.  You can actually get it and 49 other movies in the 50 Horror classics movie pack on amazon for about $16.  I won't even mention the Omega Man with Charlton Heston, except to say ""BLeech!!""",1198368000,8,1235,4.711627906976744
1605351,1,B00005JPTK,"I was hopeful when I went to see ""I am Legend.""  I liked the Charleton Heston version.  And to be fair, there was some good stuff in this movie -- here and there: the numerous shots of NYC devoid of people are impressive and while one soon feels the profusion of such shots is unnecessary (only the dimmest would have failed to have gotten the point very early), it was understandable that the producers were eager to share their accomplishment.  The movie must have cost a bundle.  Better use it all.

Moreover, Will Smith has a few effective scenes, and it was not his fault that he was upstaged by his canine co-star, who deserves some kind of animal Oscar (there actually is such a thing, but I forget its name).  Finally, the myth of ""I Am Legend"" is a powerful one.  It's a strong story, the kind of story it would take considerable effort to mess up. Who has not felt at times that he is among the last of humanity, struggling to survive while surrounded by vampires (figuratively speaking) -- perhaps at a family gathering or company picnic?

Yet the movie can be barely said to work.  It is one of those films in which any given scene is either good, but we've seen it before, many times before, or bad, and we really don't want to see it now at all.  A film in which drama is repeatedly sacrificed to special effects and big scenes.  One leaves the film not so much hating it, but wondering what was the point?

To the screen writers of this travesty here is a clue: without drama, there can be no point.  This is terribly lazy screen writing.  For example, the credits reference the work of both prior screenplays.  Did the currently screen writers somehow find the original source material weak and insufficient?  If so, why even make the movie?  This is what we call a bad sign.

Here is an example of how bad it is, one of many.  Since nothing substantive follows from the scene, I think I can describe it without spoiling anything.

The scene is a flashback.  It shows a huge, panicking crowd trying to escape.  People are being given eye scans to see if they have contracted the virus.  [What the virus turns the infected into will be noted shortly.]  A soldier who is doing the scanning, first gets a bad (positive) reading on the hero's wife.  Now remember, Smith's character is a medical doctor.  One of the Army's highest ranking in fact.  Here's what happens.  Smith starts yelling at the soldier, screaming out his rank and demanding the man scan his wife again.  The soldier complies (why would he be reluctant to give a second scan?).  This time the reading is negative.  End of scene.

What is wrong here?  For one thing, a real doctor would know at once that either the instrument is defective or the soldier does not know how to use it.  Since the procedure is quite simple, the latter possibility can be ignored.  There's not much time.  The first, however, cannot.  There is a grave risk that the instrument is defective.  Which means infected people have likely been allowed through.  His wife may be now become of them.  Remember, Smith is a top ranking military doctor.  He must be aware of that risk.  He must be aware of his responsibilities.  What to do?  What a real doctor would do is stop everything, use another detector, and perform the scan again.

The situation now is quite tense.  If his wife passes this scan, at least we can be confident that she is free of the disease.  But if she fails...  He tests her again.  Either way, the danger of infected people having gotten through is considerable.  The terror on Smith's face should show the decisions he has to make and at once.

This alternative scene would also, btw, tie directly with a later scene, the best in the film, so the audience would be prepared for it.

But the variant scene, the one with that thing we call drama, is not in the movie.  Instead we get explosions, helicopters spinning out of control, and a chance for Smith to bawl out a white guy for no reason whatever.  The whole screen play is like that.

It gets worse.  Smith talks along with an entire sequence in Shrek (I) to tell us how much he loves that movie?  Why?  What does this add?  He gives us a lecture on how much he likes Bob Marley's music.  I like it too, but why are these scenes here?  What is the point?  (I suspect, cynically no doubt, the company that made ""I Am Legend"" has financial interests in both).

There is also something vaguely racist about the whole business.  If you imagine a movie about a white doctor being besieged...  Well, this film piles it on.  New York is perhaps the most diverse city on earth.  Why, when the plague hits does it turn the victims into incredibly buff, twenty-something, white people (who would be killers on a basketball court)?  Smith really hates them.  One long action scene demonstrates the full degree of that hatred -- but they are his patients, for god's sake!  Why in that scene would he risk throwing his life away for the sheer joy of killing them?

And wouldn't you think that Smith, who is himself is immune to the plague, as a doctor would find that fact an incredibly important clue?  Nope.  He does nothing with it.

Ebert has written about the offensive stranger on the bus.  The smelly, boring, crude, and obnoxious individual, always too close for comfort and who is impossible to ignore.  Now imagine a two hour bus ride with that individual.  That is what this movie and its screen play is like.

For shame on all concerned.

1605352,3,B00005JPTK,"I'll just keep this review pretty simple.  Will Smith's acting -- very good.  A good adaption to the novel?  Nope.  Especially the ending.  And because it didn't follow the original story more closely, this is basically just another ""28 Days Later"" type of movie, albeit a good one.  But since so many of those types of movies have been out the past few years, this one doesn't stand out too much, again, because the original story wasn't adhered to.  A good film adaption (such as The Shining) take the essense of the written story and adapts to film; this one only got it partially.

I will not go into exactly what happens every moment of the movie, and there will be no spoilers here.  Instead, ask yourself if you would like to bond with Robert Neville, the character Mr. Smith plays, and go along on his dedicated journey to save lives, maintain sanity, and survive while avoiding imminent danger.  Also ask yourself if you would like a good cry.  This movie has a few tearjerking moments, and if you have any heart at all you will probably shed at least one tear.

The story takes place three years after a cure for cancer mutated into a virus that transformed humanity into cannibalistic ghouls who can't bear sunlight.  In the midst of this is Robert Neville (Will Smith) who appears to be the last surviving human.  Neville was an army scientist, and has been searching for a cure ever since the outbreak began.  He has turned his home into a fortress to keep him safe at night and spends his days foraging for food and other essentials in addition to conducting research.  Neville is fighting the good fight, but with only his loyal German shepherd to keep him company, he's struggling to maintain his sanity.

For those who have read the book, there are numerous changes in the story.  These changes are significant enough that one is better served simply watching the movie for its own sake and setting aside the book completely.  Think of it as ""inspired by"" rather than ""based on"" the novel.  While there is some humor, the overall tone of the movie is pretty bleak.  Neville lives under the constant threat of sudden death if he wanders into the wrong place or allows the creatures to find his home.  The infected are ferociously aggressive, fast, agile, relentless, and cunning.

Will Smith turns in a strong performance, which will surprise no one who has seen him before.  His dog is very likeable as well, and the audience roots for him just as much as Neville (maybe more if you're an animal lover).  The pace of the movie is uneven and it sags a bit in the middle.  The action scenes are all quite scary, though, as the infected are so hyperactively vicious in the way they attack.  The ending doesn't quite fit the rest of the movie, but it should satisfy those who want to see something hopeful come out of all the tragedy that has taken place.

I did have some problems with certain aspects of the movie.  At one point, the infected apparently set a trap for Neville that is simple in some ways, but very complex in others.  I'm not at all certain that I could rig the same trap, and these creatures are portrayed as being so primitive and rabid that it's hard to picture them hatching such a plan.  I had other issues with the plot, but since they occur in the second half, I will not specify them to avoid spoilers.

I Am Legend is a decent movie and the legion of Will Smith fans will almost certainly want to give it a try.  It's far from perfect, but it has scary action scenes, pathos, and even a little humor.  As mentioned earlier, fans of the book will need to set aside their expectations and go along for the ride or avoid this movie like the plague.

1605355,5,B00005JPTK,"I can see why this movie is getting wildly disparate reviews.  It is not what it was marketed as: a horror/SF/zombie popcorn flick. It's not even an action movie or a thriller, although it does contain elements of those genres.

So, what is it?  It's a darkly inspiring, bleak, existential drama that looks at the price that heroes quite often pay for living out their ideals.

The main (virtually the only) character is a research scientist living in a post-apocalyptic NYC, who is struggling to find a cure for a monstrous virus that has claimed 90% of the world's population.  Most of the survivors have been turned into vicious, inhuman ghoul-like creatures that rule the night.

Smith is one of the few humans that is naturally immune to the virus, and his decision to stay is motivated by his belief that he can find an effective treatment for the illness.  Unfortunately, many of the pitiful victims he wants to help are now inhuman monsters that try very hard to kill him.

Smith lives in NYC alone, his only companion a female German shepherd.
He spends the sunlit hours playing golf, watching movies and researching the virus that caused the global holocaust.

But, when the sun starts to set, he retreats to a fortified house in the city, where he endures the sounds of the ""dark seekers"", the creatures that have been created by the disease, stalking the streets outside while he tries to sleep.

Most of the film revolves around Smith dealing with the consequences of staying in the city, instead of leaving it before it was sealed off.
Those consequences include maddening loneliness that drives him to talk to mannequins, memorize film lines and treat his canine friend more like a human child than a dog.

Be aware: this is not a happy movie, and the ending is both depressing and hopeful.  Smith pays a horrific penalty indeed for his decision to stay in the city and fight the disease.

The most gripping scene in the film to me was Smith locked in a room sealed by a glass door, with the creatures breaking in.  He pleads with them to stop trying to kill him, not out of fear, but out of his desire to cure the illness that has turned them into monsters.  But their cries of hatred and blood lust drown him out.

I think that the scene says something very profound about the sad depravity of human nature, and our tendency to destroy the very things that offer us an escape from the unrelenting meaninglessness of our lives.

So, in summary: don't go to this film looking for a special effects extravaganza, although the special effects are actually quite good.  Don't go looking for a shoot 'em up thrill ride, although there is plenty of shooting and creatures getting blown away.  If you go, expect a profoundly moving human drama that, if you open your heart to its message, will cause you to think deeply about the reality of evil, and the price we may have to pay to defeat it.

  I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  I really like and look up to will smith.  He has been good since he first stared being seen and heard.  I saw this had gotten a few reviews of like 7.9 and 65%, but I like to judge movies myself and not just read something may not be good and shut it off.  My mother and I went to see this movie and it started at 12pm.  After all the crap they make you watch before the movie actually starts, let us say the movie started at 12:15.  I looked at my cell and it was 1.19pm.  I thought ""holy man"" this movie is going by SO fast and it has been good so far.  Then, it happened.  For the rest of the movie it dragged on and on and on.  When we left we talked about it on the way home or wear ever we were going.  There was so much that was unexplained in the film.

  Now for the break down.  The movie was about a lady who had found a cure for cancer.  She was telling how many thousands of people were going to get to use the trials.  Then you see the world sometime later and it's deserted.  There is one man and a dog.  Now you would think that a movie with a man and a dog would get boring.  But it did not.  At first.  It turns out that smiths character was a scientist.  He was stll trying to find a cure for the disease even when he thought no one was alive.  There were humans left but they had gotten sick from the drug that the lady had made.  Here was one of the problems.  They made the people look like aliens or monsters.  I understand if they get sick and look all bug eyed.  But these things looked like they came from another planet.  Later in the movie, (when these ""creatures"" were chasing smith) he was on like the 3rd or 4th floor.  They started climbing up the damn walls.  Just scaling outside walls with nothing to hold onto.  The movie did not explain how or why the hell these ""HUMANS,"" ""who were supposed to have only gotten sick from a new medicine.""  Could climb up walls.  They showed the faces of these things a few times and they made them look like they knew they were evil and trying to kill people.  So that was strange and got me thinking.  Then it never really explained how smiths character was immune to the virus.  So now you are left thinking about two pretty important things.  Don't you all worry, because these are not the only things that made me give this a 2.  Then there's smiths dog.  Cretin animals were immune to the air born virus but not if they were bitten.  Never explained this, nor did they mention why the sickened people had turned into what looks like vampires (because if they bite you, you would get the virus) or zombies (because the way they looked and walked.)  So after all this I said ""ok guess it will explain everything later on.""  The movie continued.  Smiths character had been putting out radio on am and finally he was knocked out and awoke with a woman and child helping him.  The lady said she had herd his message.  She said there was a bunch of people in a camp some wear.  Smith yelled and told her that there were no people.  She was going to go and leave him there.  Well in the end the zombie-pire-human type things had followed them to the place they were staying one night.  Did I mention that these human some how could not go into sunlight.  So they had to travel only at night?  So The evil hums started to get into the house and smith hid the lady and her sun, found a grenade and as soon as the zoms shattered the glass that was protecting him.  He threw it.  Killing himself and the zombies.  Then it shows the lady found the military base, with other people mind you and was safe.  She was talking about smiths character ""who she said was 50 something,"" they did a bad job of making him look as old as he was supposed to be had died saving the cure.  Even though he gave her the cure and died for nothing.  When the movie ends, you will more than likely be like UM.  Actually a man in the theater we were in said ""OK"" as I was walking out.  The movie was only like an hour and 40 minutes.  Perhaps if it had been longer like 2 hours and 40 minutes.  They could have explained more.  But this movie tried to be to many different kinds of movie.  If they had made it only about people getting sick and dying, and a man sill ok trying to find a cure.  It probably would have been better.  But there are so many unanswered questions and things that make no sense, that it is hard to enjoy.  I know I will never watch it again.  I am a collector of movies and I shall not buy this one.  Will if you ever read this, I think you are one of the best actors I have seen in my 22 years of life.  So keep up the good work.  You acted great in this film.  It just didn't play well with you.",1198195200,2,4823,4.111948331539289
1605357,4,B00005JPTK,"Just saw I Am Legend.  I enjoyed it.  I had heard years ago that they were going to remake Omega Man with Arnold Swarzenegger, and guess what? A bunch of zombie movies started springing up all over the place (Dawn of Dead remake, 28 days, Shaun of Dead, etc), but I never heard anything about Omega Man again---until, I heard that they WERE actually going to do it, but now call it by its original title, I Am Legend, and the biggest box office star in the world, Will Smith, would be the lead.  If they would have made this film back during Arnold's heyday, I think it would have been successful.  But, later on, not so much, BUT, with Smith in it right now there is no doubt this movie will be a huge moneymaker.  The comparisons to Omega Man with one of my all-time favorites Charlton Heston?  Well, I like that the ""creatures"" are more intelligent in Omega Man, not just pure monsters out for food.  I think most people agree that out of Heston's ""post-apocolyptic sci-fi trilogy--Planet Apes, Soylent Green, and Omega) Omega hasn't weathered as well.  But, I think some of the best scenes in Legend are almost taken directly from Omega Man.  The driving alone through the deserted city, and some of the ""cracking up"" scenes with Heston, especially the telephone/booth scene is better that Smith freaking out about the empty city.  The ending scenes are quite powerful from both films, but I prefer Heston's ending as well.  So, I guess if you like scary/horror/action films, you should check out Legend.  And then maybe you should watch the Omega Man and the original with Vincent Price.  IF you don't like this stuff, then don't waste your time.",1198195200,2,1651,4.613013698630137
1605358,4,B00005JPTK,"The year is 2012, and Dr. Robert Neville (Smith) may be the last man on Earth.  He is partially responsible for a cancer cure that mutated and turned humans into beings that cannot stand sunlight and crave blood.  Neville is lonely, and only has his dog Sam for a friend.  During the day, he searches for food and supplies, and works on trying to cure this awful disease.  At night, he locks himself away in his house and hides from the horrors that wander the streets.  One day, he gets sloppy, and his world becomes worse.

Will Smith carries this movie full on his back.  Acting alone or with only a dog, he is the reason to see this movie.  Like Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"" or John Cusack in ""1408"", he gives a solid performance all on his own.  Visually, ""I Am Legend"" is mostly excellent.  A desolate New York City is well rendered and eerie.  The monsters, on the other hand, mostly look like the work of CGI.  That's a shame because CGI wasn't really needed for them.  The story does differ from the classic novel by Richard Matheson, and while the ending isn't a total cop-out, it is a bit disappointing.  On its own merits, ""I Am Legend"" works pretty well and is worth checking out.",1198108800,,1188,4.389908256880734
1605359,3,B00005JPTK,"While this is the fourth time the story for I Am Legend has been adapted for film (first as The Last Man on Earth, second as The Omega Man and third as I Am Omega), the script is unduly similar to countless other horror and sci-fi films of late. Lone survivor Neville faces the monotony of isolation (as seen in Cast Away) and grasps at the hope that he can discover a cure for the virus that has wiped out civilization (as seen in the equally mediocre Resident Evil). The constant ""jump"" scares become predictable and the stodgy creature designs are curiously reminiscent of The Mummy's Imhotep. I Am Legend is unfortunately one of those films that may be entertaining at first glance, but will be quickly forgotten.

From the first few minutes of the film it is more than apparent that the last man on earth is not alone. And that's when the suspense hits. The most impressive and annoying aspect of I Am Legend is the wavering suspense turned to constant apprehension. It is not intellectual or psychological suspense like that found in Alfred Hitchcock's legendary works, but mere ""jump scares"" that create shock from the unexpected. Startling the audience with fulminating noises, sudden movements and creatures lashing out at the screen, this is clearly the poor man's replacement for genuine scares. The constant fright builds plenty of anticipation, but due to the regular intervals of scream-inducing moments, it becomes rather predictable as the movie progresses.

A lot has been left to the imagination, especially during the adaptation of the novel, of which the film deviates so greatly that taking its title was far from necessary. The post virus break out is narrated through dream sequences and flashbacks to explain why Neville is alone in New York. While much of the deterioration of humans into vampiric zombies is not covered, the reverse effect, in which the creatures begin to grow smarter and appear to follow a leader, is completely untouched by explanation. In fact, the last we hear of Neville's experiments is that they have de-evolved into the most primitive of life forms - and the very next second they are plotting intricate traps and training zombie dogs to attack.

In an attempt to demonstrate Neville's loneliness as the last man on earth, he sets up mannequins in the neighboring video rental store to simulate interactivity with humans. It is a relatively successful demonstration of the mental instabilities he suffers due to extreme isolation, but even at its finest, when he finally confronts a female mannequin that he continually jokes with his dog about approaching, it feels like an inferior version of Cast Away. At the same time, a single shot of one of the mannequins seemingly turning its head as Neville passes by, is the highlight of the horror creepiness, which is perhaps the only real psychological scare.

I Am Legend remains entertaining throughout (mostly due to Smith's onscreen charisma and the incessant jump scares) but ultimately offers nothing new to the genre. Straying far from the novel's more thought-provoking storyline, (involving multiple factions of human digression and vampire tendencies), this Legend never really breaches the sci-fi horror category and often feels all too familiar for those keeping up on their sci-fi/horror films. Superb action sequences help and poor creature designs certainly don't, but enough entertainment can be had that Smith's latest work is worth a look for those interested in the genre; just don't expect anything too legendary.

1605430,5,B00005JPTK,"In the beginning of the movie a woman scientist/doctor accomplishes a medical breakthrough. She is being interviewed, and saying to the world that they have found a cure for cancer.

Immediately, we flash to New York City
 three years later, It is literally DEAD.

Foilage has grown up all the buildings, and the skyscrapers stand empty. The roads are cracked with weeds growing high through thier cracked surfaces. Empty cars are left abandoned, and wild deer run amok, over the cars and down the streets of a silent city. It has a very eerie feel to it.

Will Smith is the only man left alive. He was immune to the virus that wiped out civilization. His German Shepard also survived the infection.

When the infection hit, there were 6 billion people on earth. The virus had a 90% kill rate-That's 5.4 billion people dead. With less than a 1% immunity it left 12 million healthy people.( The other 580 million turned into the mutated creatures we see throughout the film0
These creatures killed and fed off of the rest of the survivors, until there was no one left except Robert Neville (Will Smith's character)

The creatures I mentioned are nocturnal, and ten times as ugly and violent as the infected on ""28 Days Later.""And
since they ARE nocturnal, Will Smith can only do his hunting, gathering, and other chores (errands, DVD store etc,) during the day. He also sends out a broadcast on all AM frequencies,pleading that if there are any other survivors, to please contact him. He waits everyday at the same place also,hoping against all hope.

The thing that amazed me most about this movie, was the EMPTY New York. I read that they emptied BLOCKS of the city to do the movie, because green screen, they felt, would just not have been effective enough. It gave the movie a very creepy quality they could not have acheived with green screen alone.

The scare factor too was good( If you like to be scared, and I do :)  )
When the infected chase him, for example, It KEEPS you jumping-THAT'S FOR SURE !!

I won't say what happens because I don't want to ruin an excellent movie, but you will not be dissapointed. I am hoping that when this comes out on DVD, it has alternate endings, not that anything about this movie was BAD, but I would like to see it have gone in a different direction.

There are many surprises, and you will want to talk about, and think about this movie long after it is over.
I can't WAIT for it to come out on DVD, It is a definite must own for any DVD collection.

Oh, and by the way, it does NOT follow the book. And that is a good thing, in my opinion.
 I bought the book after I saw the movie, and the two are NOTHING alike. Being that the book was written in the 1950's, the creatures were ""vampires.""- which they are NOT in the movie. Back then writers didn't have the imagination they do now. There were werewolves and vampires. period.

I like how they modernized the story for the 2000's.
Come to think about it, they WERE sort of like vampires. They came out at night,and feasted on blood (killing)...so I guess it depends what a ""vampire"" is, by what the writers IDEA of one is. hmmmmmmmmmm.",1198022400,,3133,4.483304042179262

I knew this movie had to be similar to a zombie movie, or vampire movie, because from watching the previews before I saw it in theatres, I knew the main character had to fear something other then just wild animals that escaped from the local zoo. I really liked this movie, I think Will Smith did a superb job, I think the death scene should have been a little bit less added special effects. I was so confused at the beginning, and everything was totally unexpected, which made it even better. I like how the infected were different, they had no hair, and they didn't eat people, like they do in zombie films. I don't understand that, I mean what disease would make someone want to eat other people? Even humans with rabies don't attack other humans, they just experience muscle spasms in the throat that effect breathing. They also experience: pain, itching, seizures, paralysis, hallucinations, and eventually death, so I just don't see the link there. The infected in this movie weren't dead as compared to vampires or zombies, they were simply mutated humans, with intense rabie-like sypmtons. I still think the ending sucked, but overall it was a great movie.",1198022400,,1253,4.774193548387097
1605432,2,B00005JPTK,"Just a warning, there may be spoilers in this review. You are warned.
Let's be honest everyone speaks of this movie as an adaptation of the book, but in hollywood the only adaptation to speak of is the fact that this is a remake of the Omega Man and everyone knows it. Remakes or sequals.. This is how the industry works. Now for the review....
This movie had suspense and sadness. Will Smith handles being the only black man left on earth well. With his mind slipping away due to loneliness, the inability to cope with the loss of his family and fear for his life; a general self-interest, guilt, and need to just survive becomes so much more.  This film is shown from his perspective of his current situation and his flashbacks of the last moments with his family. The cockiness and almost sociopathic (sp) behavor seen in the omega man has been replaced by a real person here. Until the moment the first infected person screams and attacks Neville I was involved and part of the fear, then the reminiscent CGI and movement from i robot came back and it was over for me. The infected looked like skin bag versions of the i robots and the Mummy from well... the mummy who made the same lame looking mouth contortions. Was there some reason they couldn't splurge on some extras and some make up in this movie? Every zombie movie, 28 days later and others were so much more frightening because they were real people, the human quality is what is most frightening and what the irony of the infection is supposed to mean > it could happen to us. However I don't think I will get an infection that will turn me or a dog into bad CGI hairless monkeys that can bust through a brick wall. On the upside Will Smith saves every scene of this movie he is in. His emotion in the video store when he breaks down finally in sorrow was a gem. It worked on more than one level and I felt made a much larger comment that I hope people can see.. On the other hand his dog was in it's own way and great character which isn't to say anything about anyone but the dog and the shooting of the dog. It had a face that made you care about and feel for and miss when she died the way she did. I thought on one hand it needed to die to push him over the edge (instead of the boy in omega man) on the other hand I sorely missed it's presence in the film and wished it could have lived which everyone wanted i think. The leader of the pack of infected was confusing to me, what did it want and why was not clear even though we are told they are mindless killers, clearly if they run in packs and communicate, then they are not mindless by any means. This was left to much to speculation I felt. If they are supposed to be human and the end result was to cure them, you are not left wanting or needing such a result. The ending felt forced, sappy and token. This women and her child that show up had the make of a stephen king crowd of token religious minority characters that show up to give the message of god and die or save everyone. It felt like she had more experience with the world gone crazy than Neville did and in a way she hijacked the movie. In a way this was like religion showing up and validating Nevilles character more than his general compassion and scientific need to make right what humans had done which was more the truth than the god's wrath and swing away (signs[movie]) realization that came and the tail end of this movie.
So to wrap things up the good things about this movie -
*Everything with Will Smith
*Neville's Dog
*The video store emotional breakdown in particular
The bad things about this movie
*the CGI infected
*The token mother at the end with the spiritual message
This film was given 2 stars because of the bad parts and because many of the scenes were not from the book or the Omega man but from 28 days later, in my opinion - they should have borrowed more...",1197936000,2,3875,4.264945652173913
1605433,3,B00005JPTK,"first, Will Smith's performance was poignant and right on target. For most of the movie he was performing to the camera exclusively (no other actors). His performance was believable, but not as good as Tom Hanks in ""Castaway."" However, I have to say that a good portion of the movie had this drag to it that almost made me fall asleep. Very slow in development, and lacked in suspense for a good portion of the movie. The strongest scene for me was immediately after his dog was attacked. I won't ruin it for you. The ending for me was a little disappointing and left me feeling empty. I felt like nothing was resolved.

Conclusion: 3 stars, Smith is believable, however this was sold as an action movie and it failed at this miserably in this reviewers honest opinion.",1197849600,2,769,4.572463768115942
1605434,5,B00005JPTK,"""I am Legend"" is one of my favorite stories, it is the Grandfather of the Zombie genre, even though it is a vampire story, King and Romero have cited it as long time inspiration (King's most recent ""Cell"" as well,haveing been so borrowed from and seen so much film-versions already, I worried about what this latest project could bring worth retelling. But the imagery alone makes this worth seeing. The ""Last Man on Earth"" traveling through ""real"" NYC locales stark and empty while hunting CGI deer in a Muscle car is so striking, it will stay with us as moviegoers for some time to come. Like many of the moments in the film. Smith is in most every shot and spends much of the movie bouncing dialogue off dogs, dummies and the camera. He is superb in what may be his best dramatic performance yet.  He sells the character clinging to the tattered shreds of normalcy, swapping DVD like rentals at the corner store, watch old newscasts, etc. Purists of the original work maybe disgruntled by the changes made to the 50 year-old classic novel, but they make the movie a tighter, stark and relevant vehicle.",1197849600,,1105,4.637755102040816
1605435,4,B00005JPTK,"What happens when in modern times, a revolutionary, almost too-good-to-be-true solution to a life threatening, scary problem appears and seems to be the cure for everything that goes wrong? As if someone walked up to you one day and said ""Oh, hi, here's a magical box that if you keep it with you all the time, you will never be sick, never have problems, and have a long lasting life."" Would you still feel the same about your life and the people in it? And would you rely on this so much...that it would destroy you? What if that solution was the cure for cancer? ""I Am Legend"" is a fascinating, new post-apocalyptic thriller starring veteran actor Will Smith. When the cure for cancer is brought upon humanity, and the drug is administered to patients, hell breaks loose. A virus is created, that starts as side effects to the drug. One day in New York, the virus mutates and ends infecting everyone on the planet, with a 90% kill rate. The virus takes these people and transforms them into possessive zombie-like creatures that are deathly afraid of the light and come out at night to hunt for survivors of the virus.

Robert Neville, a brilliant scientist, is apparently the only survivor of this pandemic, being somehow completely immune to the mutated virus. He lives alone with his dog Samantha who is also immune to the air-borne strain of the virus only in New York City, which has been completely deserted. He sends out radio signals to search for other survivors while trying to maintain his sanity and test samples of the virus in his lab he has in his basement. Everything seems OK for him, from strolling the disturbingly empty, weed-ridden streets of Manhattan, driving golf balls from rooftops, and taking unrestricted tours of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Until the night comes. At his watch's beep, Neville bolts himself into his house to protect him and Samantha from what's out there--the remaining 90% of the world's population who want to infect Neville and Samantha. He mustn't be seen in the darkness to avoid the zombie/human creatures who watch his every move, waiting for him to slip up. As if this wasn't enough, Neville is plagued with dreams of the final moments of human civilization, when the aggressive decision is made to quarantine New York City, and the horrific death of his wife and daughter.

I know what you're thinking--that I Am Legend sounds like a corny, cheesy, over-used, washed up, unoriginal B-movie Hollywood pile of crap. I can assure you, it is far from that. The film is scientifically fascinating (even from a person who despises the thought of science class) and is like a window onto our own current society that where we're headed, trying to fix everything, can end in horrific situations. The images of post-day New York are extremely disturbing and horrifying, especially if you're familiar with the city as I am, from living in its metro area. Images of a blowing, dusty Times Square, complete with its usual screens and advertisements, except with cracks in the street, weeds growing out, and no people--something that anyone who's ever been to New York will tell you is simply impossible.

The movie seems to be two-faced. There is a dire, extremely thought provoking sense of caution and tensity throughout the film, even in the calm scenes, that inspires otherworldly levels of suspense. You can do anything you like in the Big Apple that is now 100% deserted--except go out at night. This makes the film both extremely entertaining, very fascinating to watch, and utterly terrifying.

Apart from all of that, ""I Am Legend"" is the scariest film I've seen all year. By far. And it's not everyday a PG-13 receives that reward. Not only the premise of being totally alone in a disturbingly deserted huge city that used to be home to over eight million, but in other ways as well. Unlike other zombie movies, which may you leave you laughing, ""I Am Legend"" has got the stuff to leave you shielding your eyes and shaking in fear. I know it had me scared out of my mind. Some of the scenes are extremely intense, grotesque, and the movie is jam-packed with utterly horrifying jump scenes that had my completely packed theater jumping out of their seats (and no, it wasn't just me). I could say that this movie is scarier than all four ""Saw"" films combined. Therefore--unless you can take a very scary movie, it might be a good idea to pass this one up. I feel sorry for those who saw it in IMAX. But if you can take the horror, get your tickets. If one movie this season deserves your ticket money, make it ""Legend."" The film is extremely well crafted and executed. Francis Lawrence delivers incredibly good direction and the editing is very well done, with horrifying flashbacks to a panicked New York, and makes the film that much more fascinating to watch. There is a strange sense of realism in the movie, something that'll make you think, ""Could this be where we're headed?"" Not in the sense of zombies, of course, but in other disasters. The only complaints I have with this film is the ending was much less than satisfactory, and in my taste, was a bit too clichd. The second half of the film is still very good, but fails to deliver the tensity, horror, and strange fascination that the first half brings.

So, if you're looking for a way out of a bunch of dumb laughable zombie movies, and searching for one that actually scares the crap out of you, check out ""I Am Legend."" You may find yourself pleasantly surprised.",1197849600,2,5489,4.706555671175859
1605436,5,B00005JPTK,"I have read several stories by Richard Matheson but not I Am Legend, so I do not have any expectations but I can unequivocally say that a book can never be transitioned to the screen as written; telling a visual story is far different from developing a story on the printed page.  For my wife and me I Am Legend is a terrific thriller that does not let up.  Will Smith gives an excellent performance as Robert Neville who decides to remain behind as Manhattan is cut off from the rest of the world to battle a man-made virus. The emotion level that he reaches in his portrayal beautifully conveys the commitment of his character to find a cure that will save those infected by the virus.  His relationship and devotion to Sam the German Shepard is a joy to watch and becomes distressing for us when Sam succumbs to the virus.

Although other reviewers found the film slow I liked the pacing.  First we learn what it is like being the last human on Manhattan by observing Robert Neville performing his everyday chores and activities. We get to know him.  Flashbacks tell the story of Neville's family and their escape from New York into the supposedly safe are beyond.  He has been on his own, alone except for Sam, for three years, and it is the emotional toll, his desperation for someone to talk with, that Will Smith makes so convincing.  He does not meet another human being until the last quarter of the film when Anna saves him from the infected.  When he finally meets Anna, Neville finds it a bit hard to communicate right away and finds her optimism that anyone has survived to be doubtful.

The supporting cast includes Will Smith's daughter, Willow, and Salli Richardson as Neville's wife, very brief but nicely played roles.  Although I have seen several virus/zombie films like 28 Days Later and the Dead series by Romero I did find the creatures in this film rather creepy.  The scene where Sam follows a deer into a building held a lot of suspense for me.  The creatures do look a bit unreal sometimes and I took them all to be CGI generated until I learned that someone actually played the ""Alpha-Male"" that attempts to capture Neville.  There are some things about the film that do stretch the imagination a little.  My wife was wondering how destroying the bridges into Manhattan would stop people from getting off the island: couldn't someone build a raft or simply swim.  Was Anna on Manhattan the entire time or did she travel to the island?  There are a few questions like this that are not essential to the story but make one wonder, and require a book to answer all of the sub-plots.

I Am Legend is a film that requires more than one viewing to take in marvelous design of a New York being taken over by nature and I think one would be better able to see all of the facets in Will Smith's performance.",1197849600,2,2826,4.507843137254902
1605437,5,B00005JPTK,"The special effects of this movie are amazing and Will Smith puts in the performance of his career as Robert Nevell, a survivor of a virus who drives around Manhattan shooting at deer and visiting the video store by day.  At night, he and his dog are locked in their apartment while crazed creatures (a la Dawn of the Dead) run amok outside.

The movie never gets boring and there are several bone chilling scarry parts.  Smith takes Nevell's character way beyond Matheson's novelette and surely beyond Vincent Price's or Charleton Heston's earlier renditions.",1197763200,2,560,4.9361702127659575
1605438,4,B00005JPTK,"Richard Matheson's 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"" is universally, and rightly, considered a touchstone in modern horror and science fiction literature.  Its story of one man's fight for survival in a world of undead caused by a horrific plague has been the offspring for countless cinematic variations (e.g., NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and 28 DAYS LATER), and two overt cinematic adaptations--1964's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with Vincent Price); and 1971's THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston).  And now, in our time, it is Will Smith's turn to take up the role of humankind's last best hope in this third adaptation of Matheson's book, using its original title this time.

Smith stars as Robert Neville, a virologist who had, in the year 2009, played a pivotal role in the development of a viral cure for cancer that instead turned into a violent plague that decimated the world.  Now, in the year 2012, he roams the deserted streets of the Big Apple with his trusted dog Samantha, foraging for supplies, sending out radio calls into the void in the off-chance that there are real survivors out there--and getting back to his townhouse before nightfall.  For it is nightfall that the Dark Seekers, those plague survivors who have turned into horrible mutants, come out to make his life a living hell.

Smith's rationale for staying alive amidst all this horror is the development of a vaccine that can reverse the spread of the virus--a vaccine that he tries on Dark Seekers that he captures.  It also helps him maintain his sanity, as he has terrible flashbacks to the beginnings of the plague.  Once he encounters a totally normal woman (Alice Braga) who has survived in a colony in Vermont, he sees a ray of hope for humanity.  But will he be able to make the promise he made to himself years before come true?

It has to be said that, much like the two other films based on it, I AM LEGEND strays significantly from its source material (the monsters in the book are vampires, and the setting is Los Angeles, not New York).  Indeed, this third version takes its cue as much from the John Corrington/Joyce Corrington screenplay of THE OMEGA MAN as it does from Matheson's book, particularly in Smith's attempt to develop a cure for the plague.  Also, the Dark Seekers, as they are conceived, look a little too much like what they really are, namely CGI creations, as opposed to the pale vampires of THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, or the Manson-like mutant cult of THE OMEGA MAN.

All the same however, I AM LEGEND works well enough because Smith, who holds the screen all by himself for three-fourths of its running time, is able to convince us of his character's situation--concern; panic; horror; and much more.  Though some of the special effects are a tad bit excessive on occasion, director Francis Lawrence and screenwriters Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevitch manage to conjure up enought suspenseful situations to make this enterprise more than tolerable, and on many occasions very frightening.

It may be that Matheson's book is unfilmable the way Matheson wrote it, what with Hollywood's concern for thrills and chills at the expense of the novel's psychological and scientific horror.  But Smith's performance and the scenes of a completely deserted Big Apple are more than enough to paper over the flaws, and make I AM LEGEND a very good cross of horror and science fiction the likes of which have not really been seen in Hollywood for quite some time.",1197763200,2,3451,4.784511784511785
1605439,4,B00005JPTK,"Had I seen this movie without reading the book I would put it on my top ten list of favorite movies.  However, the way the movie was adapted was so far from the source material the only recognizable aspect was the basic premise and the name of the main character.  That being said, the movie was very entertaining and was not at all a waste of my money.  I think anyone who likes the action/horror genre would appreciate this, but if you have read the book, go into the theater with an open mind, forget about the source material, and just enjoy yourself.",1197763200,4,555,4.368932038834951
1605500,4,B00005JPTK,"The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was the concept. What if the world's population turned into zombies and, as far as you knew, you were the only man left on earth? What would you do for food? How would you handle the lack of human contact? Could it be possible that somewhere, another human walked the earth? How could you hide and protect yourself from the thousands of hostile and aggressive super-zombies that surrounded you? Would you have any hope of an existence that amounted to more than just trying to survive until the next day? In addition to a solid story, the visuals are nice, the acting is good, and the suspense is almost unbearable. Not all zombies walk. My girlfriend's hand was sore from clenching my hand throughout the movie. This movie is a nice change of pace from what you may be used to watching.",1197763200,2,829,4.533333333333333

Everything is bright and sunny, with him riding around an isolated NYC with his dog.  After a while though, his alarm on his watch starts going off, and he heads home, while the dark starts creeping up he gets in and closes off his house, windows and all.  You then hear horrible, demonish sounds outside.  You get it that this is a nightly routine for him. You do get a couple of great scenes that are scary in this, but the movie really plays up on his sense of isolation and aloneness. I think the reason my husband didn't like it was because of the time it took to get established.  I don't think the story would have worked had he just all of a sudden started with the monsters, it had to tell what his life was to that point, and how it started to change.

1605502,4,B00005JPTK,"""I Am Legend"" is not a film that sticks closely to it's source material.  While that is it's biggest flaw, it is also where it shines.  If you ha told me two years ago that I'd get misty-eyed watching Will Smith sing ""Three Little Birds"" in a big budget motion picture I'd have laughed myself silly, but this adaptation of Richard Mathson's untouchable novel that -while itself being a vampire story- inspired the entire zombie film genre as we know it takes the story we all know whether we've read the book or not and turns it into an exceptionally personal affair for all of us.  One man.  One dog.  A familiar metropolis deserted by day, but crawling with death by nightfall.  This is our setting and it's one that never gets old for me.

The plague that wipes out Robert Neville's world is never fully explained, simply inferred to be the result of some sort of failed cure for cancer.  Gone from the novel and the original Vincent Price classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B000WC3A0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>, is the long struggle of Neville to save his ill daughter, his wife's tranformation, and the shocking actions of the US government to contain the plague.  What it left is simply one man, alone trying to maintain his sanity and hopelessly searching for a cure to a disease that has already wiped humanity off the face of the earth and left the ""survivors"" as rabid vampiric horrors.  It's sad, it's pathetic, and it's perfectly human.  Will Smith has a penchant for picking terrible, schmaltzy films to star in, but no one can deny his talent and charisma as a leading man.  Naturally, this is a film he must carry single-handedly and he does an awesome job of it; he's dramatic, he's relateable, and at times, he is funny.  The humor is that of the dark and inappropriate kind, but in a world like his, that is all there is left.

The vampires/zombies/infected in this are all CG and more than a bit reminiscent of Gollum from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>. I'm not a fan of these kind of effects when practical would have been more effective and was acutely aware of the fact that I watching computer-generated monsters, but they worked nonetheless.  The infected prove to be terrifying foes for Neville to face, combining suprising cunning, inhuman strength, and impossible agility (hence the CG).  Their only weakness is that sunlight kills them almost instantly.  Neville plays a game of cat-and-mouse with them, gathering supplies, researching  cure, and searching for survivors by day while making sure to get back to his fortified apartment before nightfall when the creatures come out to hunt for his hiding place.  More than a few shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;are present in this film, which is funny considering the book and it's film offspring are largely what provided the elements of that film.  So I guess the genre has officially come full circle now.

Ultimately, it's the personal touches that make ""I Am Legend"" such a treat.  Bob Marley provides both the soundtrack to Robert Neville's day and the inspiration for his work, which is both ironic and uplifting at times.  This may sound strange for a horror flick, but if you are a fan of Marley (himself a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend/dp/B00005Y23E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend</a>) it makes all the sense in the world as you watch.  Watching Neville attempt to interact with mannequins he's set up as he returns the movies he rents (in alphabetical order, one at a time) and seeing him snap when one of the figures is moved is both amusing and, at times, intensely disturbing.  When relief finally comes, Neville finds he has lost the ability to interact with other humans at all and is relegated to performing lines from ""Shrek"", which is playing on his television at the time.  The ending is a complete 180 from the book which is disappointing, but not as corny as it could have been.  The novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765357151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>&nbsp;has one of the most brilliant and darkly ironic endings ever put on paper, but director  Francis Lawrence didn't ruin it by go for the happy ending either.  The result is a compromise between the pitch blackness of the book and the cloying cheese that many Will Smith fans love.  It turns out a bittersweet and hopeful conclsion that should satisfy both while not thrilling either.  But I left the theater with ""Redemption Song"" still ringing in my ears and a satisfied feeling.  If only every movie could do that for me.

""I Am Legend"" fails to adapt the book of the same name to the big screen, but succeeds in so many other ways.  I can't give it a perfect score, but I will give it a very hearty recommendation to fans of Will Smith, zombies, vampires, and Bob Marley.  Enjoy.",1197763200,375,5238,5.369645042839657
1605503,4,B00005JPTK,"I Am Legend is one of the films I greatly anticipated for Winter 2007 and having just emerged from the theater I feel as though a great deal is needed.  Perhaps my hopes were just too high but let's look at this point by point.

I Am Legend is roughly take 6 at the original novel of the same name.  The Omega Man is probably the most popular and, for fans of that movie and older generations, this will prove very disappointing as both films derive multiple themes from the book such as Sam the dog, a woman entering Neville's life, etc, etc.  ""IAL"" just was not unique enough to satisfy certain fans.  For the general audience, however, there are some redeeming qualities.

The visual were very nice.  New York city was reproduced superbly if not used outright as several blocks were closed off for the filming; kudos.  The ""monsters"" were kind of freaky but I almost felt a humanistic touch to them as one seemed to express remorse for losing one of his kind (I thought she was his daughter or something) but it's not expanded on.

The acting, which comprises almost solely on Will Smith, is superb.  I still am having trouble finding a movie Will Smith acted poorly in every movie he is in I think about seeing just on that basis.  He performs well as a man living almost entirely alone for several years but remains diligent in his tasks.

The story had potential.  It deviated slightly from the book in terms of the ending but I think almost for the better.  I'm glad the directors took a different approach to the Twilight Zone-esque themes of vampires that the original book took.  DESPITE ALL THIS, the movie was TOO SHORT.  It was barely 90 minutes (I think) and sooo much more could've been explained, expanded upon or even made somewhat kewl.  The ending came too quick and very anti-climatic almost to the bewilderment of the audience.  They didn't even bother to explain how certain things came to be and that really bothered me.

The story is similar to War of the Worlds only the movie didn't suck as much; too many holes, not enough time.  IAL could've easily been an epic but directors settled for a 90-minute money bagger and I'm quite disappointed.  The movie started out awesome but just fell short at the end.

I will still buy this on DVD when it comes out but for theater goers I must give a warning that there are holes.  Also, THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM.  Several people tried to ward me off due to ""horror-elements.""  This is not the case.  If anything, it is a thriller.  It is appropriate for most audiences although I wouldn't bring too young of kids.

All in all, a B-.  Diss marks for lack of story and length.  It kills the movie.",1197763200,,2662,4.462655601659751
1605504,4,B00005JPTK,"In just a couple of years, cancer will be cured via a mutated version of the measles virus...reprogrammed to destroy cancer. Yet just three years after that, mankind will be all but extinct, as the virus has mutated yet again to where it either kills the person carrying it or turns that person into a type of light-fearing zombie set on eating living flesh of any kind. In Manhattan, the lone ""normal"" survivor is Dr. Robert Neville, who coincidentally was the military scientist who was madly working on a cure as all of society crumbled around him. He continues to work on a cure...even when it seems there might not be any reason one is needed. Accompanied only by his faithful canine companion Sam, he roams the streets of NYC, hunting for deer, gathering supplies, renting DVDs and sending out an AM signal encouraging others to come to him. Oh, and occasionally ensnaring a zombie so that he can take it back to his lab to try his latest serum on it.

That's the premise in a nutshell. You might be picking up on just a little cynicism in my description, because the movie invites it. It throws out a few tidbits about exactly what has happened to mankind and the virus (and also to many other species), yet the puzzle pieces we pick up don't quite make a full puzzle and sometimes the pieces don't seem to be to the same puzzle.

Many, many movie have been made about the last remnants of mankind. A good recent example is the powerful CHILDREN OF MEN. We have a society that has apparently lost the ability to produce offspring. That's all we are told...no other details about how this has happened. It just has...and we see the consequences on society and on the very soul of mankind. If the movie had let little details trickle out...we would have tried to piece them together and no doubt we would have been left frustrated. Instead, we just have to accept it, and go where the movie takes us.

I AM LEGEND throws out some tidbits and we try to assemble them into a cohesive narrative. But it can't be done. When the film was over, we spent our time trying to make sense of the little bits, instead of talking about the grand scheme of things...the movie itself.

And there IS much to admire in the movie. Honestly, I have never seen CGI used more effectively to create a city. In Peter Jackson's KING KONG, he used CGI to recreate a Great Depression-era NYC. It was beautiful and convincing...but the abandoned Manhattan that we see in I AM LEGEND is even more seamless. You almost never can tell where a real set blends with a computer generated one. The city is empty, the bridges are destroyed, weeds grow everywhere and deer run everywhere. It's actually a pretty startling accomplishment, and seeing Will Smith driving all through these streets that should be jammed with people, traffic, lights, energy but instead are like a metropolitan dust bowl is pretty scary. And the effects are really convincing. Even the CG deer (and the lions who appear, no doubt having escaped from the Central Park Zoo) look amazingly convincing.

And Will Smith gives a committed performance. He's not a great actor, but he is a charismatic presence...which in a film like this, where he's the ONLY person on screen for huge chunks of time, is even more important. We have to see the world almost entirely through his eyes, and Smith does an outstanding job in showing us the loneliness he feels all the time and the insanity that is lurking just around the corner. Smith is aided in his work by Sam, a wonderful German Shepherd. Sam is not one of these dogs who has been trained to cock his head to the side all the time and look like he understands every word being spoken. He's not ""cute."" He looks like a dog you or I could own...smart, but also still just a dog. He is loyal to a fault, but also inadvertently nearly gets his master killed in an amazingly tense scene in a dark warehouse where we first encounter the zombies. So I guess I'm saying Sam gives a naturalistic performance! Kudos to his trainers, and even to Smith, who works with Sam like a man who owns a DOG and not some unnaturally sensitive creature.

There are some exciting scenes, no doubt. And as we would expect, the film has a huge final confrontation between Smith and a marauding horde of zombies. In many ways, it's a good scene...lots of noise, close calls, explosions and so forth. But sadly, where the CG that created NYC is nearly perfect, the filmmakers chose to make the zombies CG creations as well, and not for one moment do these creatures look physical. They are obvious CG creations...and that saps so much drama from the film. And I have to wonder WHY they did it? Certainly there are amazing things that can be done with makeup...and real people could have done a most of the things the zombies do. It was a serious blunder, in my opinion.

I won't tell you any more of the plot, but suffice it to say that at the end, just a few too many ""oh, isn't that convenient"" moments pop up...and our willingness to suspend disbelief crumbles a bit. I would say that the first hour or so are really excellent, gripping, convincing and well-acted. The final 25 minutes or so are contrived and a bit awkward. It's like someone letting out the air from a very nice balloon.

It's still a movie worth seeing. It's brisk enough to show you a good time...but when I left, my first thought was that the film could have been so much more. And then my mind turned to puzzling out all the inconsistencies in the back story. Don't let yourself be sucked in by those, and maybe you'll enjoy it more!!  3.5 stars.",1197763200,2,5585,4.516320474777448

I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I'd seen a few commercials, but I didn't have any idea what it was about, and I had no real desire to see it, except that a friend of mine wanted to go, and asked me to come along.

I loved the first half-hour or so of this film. Seeing empty, overgrown Manhattan streets is surreal and eerie, even on a clear day with bright sunshine and the occasional bird singing. Anybody who has ever been to New York City should appreciate how wonderfully chilling it feels to hear virtual SILENCE in the city streets. The atmosphere is incredible, the details are amazing (be sure to check out the gas prices; you'll wince), and the whole setting is extremely well done. Enter Will Smith, the last man on Earth... sort of. Manhattan is his playground (and his hunting ground); he has the whole place to himself. And he makes some very interesting use of it. His antics are amusing, and truly fun to watch; even better, it makes you think about what it might really be like to be the last person alive on Earth. And better still, they make some sense (considering that such solitude would make anybody at least a little crazy); they're actually BELIEVABLE. Until the mutant zombie vampire things show up. After that, it's pure cliched horror movie shtick, and that's when the trouble starts.

First of all, the CGI mutant zombie vampire things are just BAD. REALLY bad. They don't look real, and they're not scary; we've seen creatures like them done before, and done better. The scares are limited to cheap (and predictable) shock moments where a loud noise makes you jump after a prolonged quiet. But I digress. Even the CGI animals early in the movie are unconvincing, which is a problem in this day and age. Given the budget expended for this film, they definitely could have done better.

Second, the final hour or so is riddled with plot holes. The first half of the movie shows that Manhattan is completely cut off from the rest of the world. The bridges have been blown up and the tunnels are flooded. So where do the other uninfected characters come from? How does Will Smith single-handedly fortify his house with steel closures and explosives, and build a fully-stocked medical lab in his basement? Where does he get his electricity from, if everybody else is dead? The film doesn't even attempt to answer these questions; it's probably better for it, given how clumsily the story was handled. Still, the second half does have a few good moments, but they're never put to use. In one scene halfway through the film, something happens that suggests that the mutant zombie vampire things are actually intelligent and crafty, and maybe even organized and social. It would have been a nice twist, but that idea is never capitalized on; it immediately gets thrown by the wayside, and the CGI baddies revert to incessant screaming, rushing at Will Smith in mindless zombie fashion, and performing superhuman feats which are completely unbelievable. They scramble up the facades of buildings like Spiderman, for crying out loud!

And lastly, the ending is pure Hollywood. Will Smith goes out with a bang, and conveniently saves the world in the process, and what's left of humanity lives happily ever after, yada yada yada. It's horrible, and even preachy. Through it all, Will Smith remains watchable, though, and he manages to save this film from being completely forgettable.

What awesome promise this movie showed in its first few minutes. It could have been a wonderful psychological drama; why they chose to turn it into a cheap horror movie wannabe is beyond me. It could have been great. The first third of it *IS* great. But then it falls apart.",1197676800,2,3710,4.744186046511628
1605506,5,B00005JPTK,"""I Am Legend"" is great! This is how the story goes: Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable...and manmade. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City...and maybe the world. But he is not alone. He is surrounded by ""the Infected"" -- victims of the plague who have mutated into carnivorous beings who can only exist in the dark and who will devour or infect anyone or anything in their path. For three years, Neville has spent his days scavenging for food and supplies and faithfully sending out radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. All the while, the Infected lurk in the shadows, watching Neville's every move, waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But his blood is also what The Infected hunt, and Neville knows he is outnumbered and quickly running out of time. The cast led by Will Smith (as Robert Neville) is excellent! The directing by Francis Lawrence (who also directed ""Constantine"" (2005) is great!

1605507,5,B00005JPTK,"There's lot of Bob Marley in this film. My favorite line was the Bob Marley quote about why he was going to perform TWO days after being shot in an assassination attempt: ""The bad people in the world never take a rest, so neither can I."" Bob Marley believed that music and love could change and heal the world. He was a true visionary, and I'm so very glad his very important message has not been forgotten by Hollywood! Playing various tunes from his Legend album makes Bob Marley's dream for peace all that more poignant!

I'm a fan of the original Omega Man film with Charleston Heston. Over the years I have watched it about a dozen times. I never tire of it! This remake pays homage to the original. But it's a very, very different interpretation. For example in the original film it was a biological warfare agent that got loose in the world. Now it's a genetically engineered virus to cure cancer that caused the destruction of the human race. In other words - biotechnology does us all in!

""I Am Legend"" also made me squirm because other than the occasional Bob Marley tune, so much of this film had zero music or sound effects. After a while you felt the Will Smith character's mind-boggling loneliness. This is first, and foremost, a psychological film. Even the movie theater audience barely made a sound! The filmmakers had tremendous courage not to dumb the story down to the level of adolescent boys. I have been begging Hollywood for years to make a Sci-Fi film suitable for the mature adult mind - so thank you! You've done it!

My favorite scene was the very last one. It showed how civilization can survive in the future - by being self-sufficient. Keep an eye out for the ultra-modern windmills and solar panels. The scene only lasts a few seconds, but it speaks volumes!

This film will be watched a 100 years from now! It's that good!

Anyone who frequents zombie films and who is also not looking for Shakespeare at the same time will tell you as I will that 28 Days Later and 30 Days of Night are pretty much as good as it gets. Sure the old favorites are great and the new Dawn of the Dead is good too. We who enjoy such films are not used to well written scripts, above average performances, and poignant scenes with good dialogue. We are also not used to seeing too much emotion and certainly not used to seeing any thing too symbolic or even religious. For all these things are usually not in low budget zombie films. This film had some of these things in different quantities. Will Smith was good too.

I lost myself in this film. I was there on the streets on NYC as a secret observer. It was suspenseful for me as a result of this. Was it perfect? No. Was it better than average as far as films about zombies go? Yes. Was it unique as far as films about zombies go? Pretty much.

What did the film have that bothered me? Well for starters it had a leader zombie. Zombies do not have leaders. At least in my mind they do not. I also felt the whole sunlight vampire thing was not needed. Simply having them be nocturnal would have been fine. Raccoons are nocturnal and I have rarely seen them in daylight. Films like these suffer from too much explanation. The less that is said and the more that is implied or alluded to the better. It helps activate minds and let creative people wonder. This breeds discussion and speculation. Films like this that are done well and go easy on exposition usually stand the test of time. 2001 comes to mind as well as the Shining. When we are dealing with something we have never seen before, something that is complete fiction, less is always more. Our subconscious will fill in the rest.

Perhaps we will see more big budget films like this.",1197676800,4,2001,4.3138297872340425

Most of the movie was spent just showing how along Will Smith was in New York.  That was cool for about 5 minutes, then it just got silly.  The only saving grace of this film is Will Smith's performance, which was really good.  He is a very talented actor, but the poor writing & lackluster direction show once again that even the most brillian actors need good writing etc.  The ending was too convenient.  All of a sudden 2 more uninfected people just happen to show up & they know of a colony in Vermont.  Quite honestly the entire story could have been told in about 30 minutes, plus the director tried to use cheap scare tactics instead of suspence which was also not cool.

when that thing happens in the pier with his car, how does he get ""rescued""?
Inplace of ridiculous flashbacks, do they actually tell how this whole thing came out to be and what Dr. neville's role is??

I feel that in, atleast an attempting to be pragmatic frame of mind, these points are better addressed in ""Omega Man"" and charlon heston looked the part!!. Overall, this movie was very hyped and it was just bad.
Two Stars for the effects and the effort, making manhattan look like a ""green"" jungle for once was cool. :)

obviously: for the hype and all else, you would go see it anyway.",1197676800,6,951,4.621301775147929
1605594,1,B00005JPTK,"Awesome visuals do not a movie make.

This great looking movie is a meaningless remake of ""Omega Man"" and light years away from Richard Matheson's haunting and weirdly relevant novel ""I Am Legend.""

See it for the amazing views of deserted New York City.  And yes, Will Smith is very good.  For about 45 minutes this movie teases with huge potential and then it descends into below average jolts of blood-thirsty mutants jumping out of the dark with their mouths open.

SPOILER ALERT:

In the end, super-hero-with-abs Will Smith (certainly not the relatable, ordinary man of the novel) sacrifices himself for no reason and then there's a hastily  tacked on ending of survivors entering a walled-in compound somewhere in Vermont.  Is there unintentional irony here?  Have they traded freedom for the illusion of security?

No legend.  No myth.  And finally, not much of a story.

I was hoping for a movie that tickled my brain as well as my eyeballs -- like ""Blade Runner.""",1197676800,17,972,4.853658536585366

By the way, was the trap his own or made by the monsters? If by the monsters, wouldn't they also be smart enough to get clothes to protect themselves from the sunlight?? The monsters can climb the outside wall of a building, but not a security wall at the mountain village?? Geez... Hollywood writers' logic?

I was expecting a survival story, a kind of Robinson Crusoe. I Am Legend had great potential for a great story, but for some reason, the writers decided to borrow quite a bit too much and innovate too little.

Really intriguing concept, except for one thing: we've seen this before, and last time, it was called 28 Days Later - and it was a lot better than this cliche-ridden, horribly executed piece of mainstream, Hollywood trash. Once the CG ""zombies"" appeared, the entire movie went downhill from there. I went into this expecting something halfway decent. I guess I expected too much. Films like this are the reason that I avoid big Hollywood blockbusters. Ugh.",1197590400,5,491,5.0
1605598,4,B00005JPTK,"We've seen a lot of films that take place in a post apocalyptic future, and of those films, many open by telling us that government, civilization, and humanity in general collapsed because of a viral outbreak. This plot device is used once again in ""I Am Legend,"" a science fiction thriller that would be far less impressive if an epidemic was all that the plot had to go on. In all honesty, the plot isn't all that interesting or original; this is the fourth film adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, the first three being 1964's ""The Last Man on Earth,"" 1971's ""The Omega Man,"" and 2007's direct to video ""I Am Omega."" For this newest adaptation, the casting of Will Smith is what made it work, especially since he had to act by himself for most of the film. He plays an intelligent, driven, and desperate character, a man whose isolating circumstances have driven him to emotional extremes. Some extremes almost come off as funny, in a pathetic sort of way.

Yes, I can praise Smith a great deal for this role. The story, on the other hand, is generally entertaining but not entirely successful, especially as it nears the end; at that point, it relies too much on the clich&eacute;s of hope, loss, and redemption in the midst of frightening special effects. This isn't to say that the film doesn't work altogether--the first three-quarters of ""I Am Legend"" are surprisingly strong, not only because of Smith's performance, but also because of the way it builds tension. The story functions under the premise of a cure for cancer that was introduced in 2009, only to mutate into an infection. By the year 2012, ninety percent of the planet's population is dead. Of the remaining ten percent, less than one percent is immune to the virus--everyone else has been transformed into a vampire-like flesh eater. Nothing is ever mentioned about garlic or wooden stakes, but it is known that exposure to sunlight is fatal for these things.

This is the horrible future in which we find Robert Neville (Smith), a sole-surviving military scientist who struggles to exist in an empty, decimated New York City. When he's not gathering basic supplies, hunting loose herds of deer with his beloved dog, Sam, or protecting himself from hordes of mutant vampires, he's trying to discover a cure in a makeshift lab in his basement. Because he's immune, his blood serves as a possible way to produce a cure. The ironic implications of that are too clever to overlook: Blood may in fact be the key to ridding the infected of their thirst for blood. But irony is not what this film is about; at its heart, ""I Am Legend"" is about loneliness, guilt, and paranoia, all of which come into perspective during flashback sequences involving Neville and his family. Piece by piece, the fates of his wife, Zoe (Salli Richardson), and daughter, Marley (Willow Smith), are revealed, as are the facts of how Manhattan Island was quarantined.

Neville's memories are second only to his emotional well-being, which is barely hanging on by a thread. He tries to maintain his sanity by (1) keeping a video diary of his scientific research, and (2) sending out a radio message to anyone who might be alive and in need of shelter. But his sanity may be slipping. Early on, he enters a video store that not only has a fine selection of DVDs, but also a number of strategically placed mannequins. He speaks to them as if they were real people. He also avoids some out of nervousness; he just can't bring himself to strike up a conversation with the pretty female mannequin in back of the store. Here's a scene that appears light-hearted and funny but is actually quite serious. Simply put, loneliness can make a person do some strange things. And consider the moment he returns to the video store--he finally does approach the female mannequin to say, ""I promised my friend I'd say hello to you. Hello."" Now with tears in his eyes, he says, ""Please say hello to me. Please. Say hello to me.""

This is the kind of depth that can mean the difference between a compelling film and an unimaginative rehash. Most of ""I Am Legend"" is a well-structured character study, highlighted by palpable levels of suspense, drama, and fright. It isn't until the final twenty minutes that the film loses some steam, turning a fascinating story into a run of the mill creature feature. It begins with the introduction of two immune humans: a young woman named Anna (Alice Braga) and a boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan). Anna believes that a survivor's colony exists, not because she's actually seen it, but because God told her so. This, of course, brings out the worst in Neville, who has not only lost his faith, but also his willingness to leave New York--""This is Ground Zero,"" he says. ""I can fix this."" Despite his daily radio message, his years of isolation have left him unable to interact with other people, least of all with Anna.

And that's when the vampire mutants attack, infiltrating Neville's fortress/house in a final showdown. I obviously can't say how everything ends, but I can say that it isn't all that surprising given the kind of movie this wants to be. I won't go so far as to say that the ending doesn't work, but I do think it could have worked better, especially since the rest of the film was so much more effective. For the most part, ""I Am Legend"" is an above average thriller, with a tense opening that quietly plays itself out. I'm recommending this movie despite some structural and narrative flaws; on the whole, it's still an engaging, taut, emotionally charged thriller, one of the better ones of recent memory.",1197590400,11,5593,4.726434426229508
1605599,4,B00005JPTK,"It's a funny thing about `end of the world' (EOW) stories, they usually read quite well, but rarely adapt well to cinema. I've always had a fascination with EOW, not that I'm morbid, I just believe it is an inevitable scenario. One day, humanity as we know it, will be drastically altered. Perhaps viral, or perhaps ecological. No, not global warming. I'm talking asteroids, here. At any rate, a thousand years from now, maybe even ten thousand years from now, or maybe even tomorrow, some catastrophic event will bring about the destruction of society and decimation of mankind.

As with virtually all EOW stories that evolve from print to film, I AM LEGEND, the movie, falls far short of the book. That's NOT to say that the movie is not worth seeing, or even not enjoyable. It was actually quite enjoyable for me and maybe even one of the better EOW movies made to date. But....

There's always a `but' right? The movie falls short on several fronts. There is too much time spent on scenes which really fail to contribute much to the story, and not enough time spent explaining important details. There is a brief elusion to God and His plan for humanity, but that shred of promising storyline is short lived. I never like to give away too much in a review, so I'll not go further into the story itself.

Now here's what this movie does offer. Suspense, drama, fast cars, good verses evil, high tech weaponry, zombie-like humanoids and everything else one might expect. The filming is good, special effects are first rate. There really IS no casting here, it's pretty much a Will Smith solo performance.

In the end, if I had it to do over, I wouldn't spend $10 at the theater, but I would definitely pay a couple of bucks for a rental.",1197590400,5,1739,4.581993569131833

The next scene is New York City with no living humans, except Will Smith, his dog, and a ton of zombies. I found the CGI to be at the level of an amateur, and the camera bounced around in the beginning until the crew wised up and straightened it out.  The movie is nothing like the book, and this is a disappointment to say the least.  Will Smith played his part extremely well, especially his interactions with the mannequins. Obviously, he was feeling the effects of loneliness, after having lost his wife and child, with his only companion his German Shepard. It was interesting to see the zombies copy Will's technique of catching a live zombie, and then using that technique to try and catch him.  It appears that one of the zombies was the leader and had some intelligence beyond the others.
Will struggles to find a cure for the KV virus, with flashbacks of his family playing in his head, surrounded by zombies that want to eat him, and trying to combat loneliness while trying to keep his sanity. Overall, this theme has been played many times before and I was hoping for something a little different.  I was able to guess what was going to happen next. I would recommend this movie if you are a zombie fanatic.  Otherwise, why don't you watch Enemy of The State with Will Smith, it's a better movie.",1523577600,,1451,4.519083969465649
